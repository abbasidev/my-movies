1
00:00:12,583 --> 00:00:14,250
<i>We're all around you.</i>

2
00:00:16,583 --> 00:00:18,583
<i>Living right under your noses…</i>

3
00:00:20,583 --> 00:00:22,083
<i>And you have no idea.</i>

4
00:00:23,916 --> 00:00:26,625
<i>Things were a lot simpler in the old days.</i>

5
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:29,208
<i>We hunted you,</i>

6
00:00:29,958 --> 00:00:31,750
<i>and you hunted us.</i>

7
00:00:33,541 --> 00:00:34,625
<i>In Los Angeles,</i>

8
00:00:35,541 --> 00:00:39,250
<i>no one fought harder
than a place called Boyle Heights.</i>

9
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:43,791
<i>So, we struck up a truce</i>

10
00:00:43,875 --> 00:00:47,041
<i>to maintain the peace
between our kind and yours.</i>

11
00:00:47,541 --> 00:00:48,916
<i>We lived in secret,</i>

12
00:00:49,666 --> 00:00:52,625
<i>and you convinced yourselves
you had never really believed.</i>

13
00:00:52,708 --> 00:00:54,208
<i>You forgot to be afraid.</i>

14
00:00:54,791 --> 00:00:58,958
<i>You made books and movies about us
and got most of the details wrong,</i>

15
00:00:59,666 --> 00:01:01,125
<i>while we became richer</i>

16
00:01:01,208 --> 00:01:03,958
<i>and more powerful
than you could ever imagine.</i>

17
00:01:04,958 --> 00:01:08,125
<i>To this day, there are some
who still uphold the truce,</i>

18
00:01:08,208 --> 00:01:09,333
<i>who keep our secret.</i>

19
00:01:09,833 --> 00:01:11,958
<i>As long as we stick to the three rules.</i>

20
00:01:12,541 --> 00:01:15,041
<i>Don't let humans know we exist,</i>

21
00:01:15,125 --> 00:01:17,291
<i>don't feed on the unwilling,</i>

22
00:01:17,875 --> 00:01:22,708
<i>and never ever enter Boyle Heights
without permission.</i>

23
00:01:50,875 --> 00:01:52,583
- Jay!
- Sorry.

24
00:01:53,083 --> 00:01:55,708
- You scared me.
- I got distracted.

25
00:01:56,375 --> 00:01:57,625
How sorry?

26
00:01:57,708 --> 00:01:59,291
I'll-make-it-up-to-you sorry.

27
00:01:59,375 --> 00:02:01,541
Oh, you'll-make-it-up-to-me kind of sorry.

28
00:02:01,625 --> 00:02:02,958
How are you gonna do that?

29
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,250
What?

30
00:02:17,333 --> 00:02:18,416
Nah, you look nice.

31
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:19,958
I look nice?

32
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,416
You're so stupid.

33
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:35,083
What the...

34
00:02:35,166 --> 00:02:37,916
- What is it?
- They shouldn't be over here.

35
00:02:49,041 --> 00:02:51,375
Oh my God. Jay, who is that?

36
00:02:51,458 --> 00:02:52,750
A dead man.

37
00:02:55,166 --> 00:02:56,833
Put the gun back.
We cannot do this.

38
00:02:57,416 --> 00:03:01,875
Holy shit, please keep driving. Jay.
Jay, it's green, just go!

39
00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:12,625
- Jay, what's going on?
- I gotta warn my guys.

40
00:03:12,708 --> 00:03:15,416
I need you to take the car
and go to your brother's. Okay?

41
00:03:55,375 --> 00:03:56,625
Maria!

42
00:04:35,875 --> 00:04:39,041
Good morning, Mr. Perez.
What were you dreaming about?

43
00:04:39,541 --> 00:04:41,416
Sorry. I…

44
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,208
{\an8}Hey, uh, B-plus, 60 bucks.

45
00:05:37,291 --> 00:05:39,875
{\an8}Thank you, sir.
You're a lifesaver, you know that?

46
00:05:39,958 --> 00:05:41,875
You're saving my ass with this paper, bro.

47
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:47,666
<i>We're gonna check out
this club downtown, Three Kings?</i>

48
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:49,583
<i>Table, bottle service.</i>

49
00:05:49,666 --> 00:05:51,916
{\an8}- Right.
- It's 300 a head. You wanna roll with?

50
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,208
{\an8}Shit, 300 a head? Uh…

51
00:05:54,291 --> 00:05:55,291
{\an8}Yeah, yeah, yeah.

52
00:05:55,375 --> 00:05:57,833
{\an8}Nah, I already got some stuff
I gotta get into.

53
00:05:57,916 --> 00:05:59,416
{\an8}- I bet you do.
- Next time, my bad.

54
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:00,875
{\an8}All right. Stay easy.

55
00:06:12,416 --> 00:06:13,458
{\an8}Yo!

56
00:06:13,541 --> 00:06:14,916
{\an8}Yo, what's good, Benny?

57
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,375
{\an8}Hey, what's up, slick?
You got that kit for me?

58
00:06:17,458 --> 00:06:19,083
{\an8}Let's call it an even 40, bro.

59
00:06:19,166 --> 00:06:21,625
{\an8}40, like 40 bucks?

60
00:06:21,708 --> 00:06:23,125
That's what I said.

61
00:06:26,708 --> 00:06:29,958
I'mma put The Heights
on the map. I'm telling you, bro.

62
00:06:30,041 --> 00:06:32,666
Step one, finish this track.
Two, set up the label.

63
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:34,500
{\an8}Three, world domination. It's simple.

64
00:06:34,583 --> 00:06:37,333
{\an8}Building an empire,
but you can't even play me one track, bro?

65
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,583
{\an8}<i>Hey.</i>
<i>When it's ready, it's ready, all right?</i>

66
00:06:59,625 --> 00:07:01,000
Hello, Benny.

67
00:07:01,083 --> 00:07:02,208
Hey, Grandma.

68
00:07:03,541 --> 00:07:05,250
You came at a good time.

69
00:07:05,333 --> 00:07:07,041
Yeah? Why's that?

70
00:07:07,125 --> 00:07:10,500
I just took out
some flautitas and some empanadas.

71
00:07:10,583 --> 00:07:11,833
Nice!

72
00:07:11,916 --> 00:07:13,333
Are you hungry?

73
00:07:13,416 --> 00:07:16,208
- You know it.
- But why do I bother shopping

74
00:07:16,291 --> 00:07:18,250
if you're never
going to cook me a <i>sancoche?</i>

75
00:07:19,291 --> 00:07:20,916
You know I don't cook that.

76
00:07:21,416 --> 00:07:24,416
You know that one of these days
I'm going to buy you a house.

77
00:07:25,041 --> 00:07:28,166
I don't need
my own home, my love.

78
00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:31,291
What I do need is for you
to finish your studies

79
00:07:31,375 --> 00:07:33,250
so you can take care of yourself.

80
00:07:33,333 --> 00:07:35,833
Because someday
I'm gonna die, and so will you.

81
00:07:35,916 --> 00:07:39,041
Ay, Ma, why you gotta talk like that?
So negative. I don't like it.

82
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:41,083
Well, that's life, son.

83
00:07:41,166 --> 00:07:42,708
We all come tumbling down.

84
00:08:06,166 --> 00:08:08,291
Bro, you told me
you could handle it.

85
00:08:09,166 --> 00:08:10,750
No, I told you. This is...

86
00:08:11,291 --> 00:08:13,666
Come on, Jessie,
you're really gonna do me like that?

87
00:08:14,875 --> 00:08:16,875
I need someone to cover the car tonight.

88
00:08:17,458 --> 00:08:18,708
It's about Maria.

89
00:08:20,666 --> 00:08:22,791
Yeah, well, I thought I could rely on you!

90
00:08:24,125 --> 00:08:25,291
Yeah, fine, whatever.

91
00:08:27,916 --> 00:08:29,291
Why are you creeping?

92
00:08:29,375 --> 00:08:32,291
If I'd know you was coming through,
I would've rolled out the red carpet.

93
00:08:32,375 --> 00:08:34,833
I have to pick up some things,
check in on Grandma.

94
00:08:34,916 --> 00:08:36,791
- Check in on your punk ass.
- Ha.

95
00:08:39,083 --> 00:08:43,125
Oh, wait a minute. What's this?
Bro, that some gray hairs on your head?

96
00:08:43,208 --> 00:08:45,208
Hey, I'm serious.
You're getting old, <i>papi.</i>

97
00:08:45,291 --> 00:08:47,375
Just wait. It's gonna happen to you too.

98
00:08:47,458 --> 00:08:51,125
I don't know if you're working tonight,
but maybe we could go to Mario's,

99
00:08:51,208 --> 00:08:52,833
grab a pizza, watch the game.

100
00:08:52,916 --> 00:08:54,333
I got something else tonight.

101
00:08:54,416 --> 00:08:56,500
All right,
then who's covering the car, then?

102
00:08:56,583 --> 00:08:58,750
I had to cancel.
Everyone's booked up.

103
00:08:58,833 --> 00:09:01,166
All right, but you see,
I was thinking, like, what if,

104
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:03,291
you see, what if I take the car? Right?

105
00:09:03,375 --> 00:09:05,083
- 'Cause I could use the money.
- No way.

106
00:09:05,166 --> 00:09:07,125
- Why not?
- One, you're a bad driver.

107
00:09:07,208 --> 00:09:08,333
Bad… That's bullshit.

108
00:09:08,416 --> 00:09:10,166
When was the last time
you were west of K-Town?

109
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:12,791
Hey, Jay, my man, look,
I am way more responsible

110
00:09:12,875 --> 00:09:15,000
than all them dudes
you got out there at the depot.

111
00:09:15,083 --> 00:09:18,291
Yeah, except them dudes at the depot,
they got chauffeur's license,

112
00:09:18,375 --> 00:09:21,041
they're insured by the company,
and they actually own a suit.

113
00:09:21,125 --> 00:09:25,875
I… You see, the thing is, though,
Jay, I got a suit. I got a suit, Jay.

114
00:09:27,458 --> 00:09:30,083
What, you and Maria been fighting?
That's what it is?

115
00:09:30,625 --> 00:09:32,875
You having some relationship issues?

116
00:09:32,958 --> 00:09:35,041
If you want to talk to me,
you can talk to me.

117
00:09:35,125 --> 00:09:37,208
I give great advice.
That's what people be saying.

118
00:09:37,291 --> 00:09:38,791
Yeah, right.

119
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:40,583
Man, whatever.

120
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:51,458
Where'd you get that?

121
00:09:52,875 --> 00:09:54,041
Don't worry about it.

122
00:09:57,375 --> 00:09:59,791
- What's this thing you gotta do tonight?
- I said don't worry about it.

123
00:10:02,583 --> 00:10:05,875
- All right. Fine, man.
- I didn't even…

124
00:10:05,958 --> 00:10:08,333
So secretive, man.

125
00:10:10,375 --> 00:10:12,208
Hey, Benny.

126
00:10:12,833 --> 00:10:14,791
Scratch it, I'll kill you.

127
00:10:14,875 --> 00:10:16,083
Yo. You serious?

128
00:10:17,291 --> 00:10:19,916
Man! I'm gonna need me one of these.

129
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,208
You can't afford it.

130
00:10:21,708 --> 00:10:23,875
Well, I'mma flip my beats,
and I'mma get me a better one.

131
00:10:23,958 --> 00:10:25,666
- What do you think about that?
- Listen to me.

132
00:10:26,166 --> 00:10:28,166
Take them where they need to go,
come straight back.

133
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:30,375
- Understand?
- Yeah, I understand.

134
00:10:31,875 --> 00:10:34,041
Check it out.

135
00:10:36,166 --> 00:10:37,125
Oh shit.

136
00:10:38,041 --> 00:10:39,375
That's pretty cool.

137
00:10:39,458 --> 00:10:42,750
Insurance and registration
are in the glove compartment.

138
00:10:42,833 --> 00:10:44,625
Chauffeur's license on the visor.

139
00:10:44,708 --> 00:10:47,625
Everything's under my name,
so if anyone asks, you're me.

140
00:10:47,708 --> 00:10:50,041
- I'm going to Beverly Hills?
- Hey, pay attention.

141
00:10:50,125 --> 00:10:52,750
If anyone asks, you're me, got it?

142
00:10:52,833 --> 00:10:55,083
- Yeah.
- Dispatch says it's an all-nighter.

143
00:10:55,166 --> 00:10:58,083
Probably a twentysomething
director wannabe high out of his mind.

144
00:10:58,166 --> 00:11:01,041
Act professional, and he'll give you
a fat tip at the end of the night.

145
00:11:02,125 --> 00:11:04,666
Hey. Don't blow the sub, Dr. Dre.

146
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:07,000
Look, if the subs want to bark,
you gotta let 'em bark.

147
00:11:07,083 --> 00:11:11,250
No, the subs don't wanna bark. Okay?
I'm serious. I'll yank you out of here.

148
00:11:11,333 --> 00:11:14,500
- I'll take the no-show penalty.
- Okay. No barking, you got it.

149
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:17,875
Thanks for doing this.

150
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:22,458
Hey, just, um, be careful, all right?

151
00:11:23,375 --> 00:11:24,500
I'm always careful.

152
00:11:40,708 --> 00:11:42,583
I got… I got the car!

153
00:11:47,083 --> 00:11:48,083
Huh? What?

154
00:11:52,666 --> 00:11:53,625
Oh!

155
00:11:53,708 --> 00:11:55,166
That was a cop. That was a cop.

156
00:11:59,583 --> 00:12:01,291
What? I went in front of the guy!

157
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:41,375
Wow.

158
00:12:42,583 --> 00:12:43,666
Wow, wow.

159
00:13:01,791 --> 00:13:03,250
Okay.

160
00:13:11,083 --> 00:13:13,000
Um, good… good evening, Miss Moreau.

161
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,083
You're the driver?

162
00:13:21,083 --> 00:13:23,583
Uh, yeah. Yes. Yes, I am.

163
00:13:25,208 --> 00:13:28,708
Miss Moreau is running a little bit late.
I'm her friend Blaire.

164
00:13:29,625 --> 00:13:32,916
Okay, cool. I'm… I'm… I'm Jay.

165
00:13:33,833 --> 00:13:34,708
Hi, Jay.

166
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:40,916
Something wrong?

167
00:13:41,833 --> 00:13:42,666
No.

168
00:13:43,583 --> 00:13:44,500
Mm-mm.

169
00:13:45,291 --> 00:13:46,125
What?

170
00:13:49,041 --> 00:13:50,250
Your zipper is down.

171
00:13:51,625 --> 00:13:53,125
Oh shit.

172
00:13:53,208 --> 00:13:54,750
Wow.

173
00:13:54,833 --> 00:13:58,333
Sorry, I… I… I don't…
I don't mean to be unprofessional.

174
00:13:58,416 --> 00:14:00,833
I just… I should…
I had no idea that it was down.

175
00:14:00,916 --> 00:14:02,541
- Okay.
- Yeah.

176
00:14:02,625 --> 00:14:06,041
I'm just gonna stop talking 'cause I feel
like I'm making it worse now.

177
00:14:06,625 --> 00:14:10,833
Well, how about you open the door for me,
and then maybe we can call it even?

178
00:14:11,833 --> 00:14:12,708
Thanks.

179
00:14:20,791 --> 00:14:22,166
Thanks.

180
00:14:37,583 --> 00:14:40,541
You know, if you need me
to adjust anything, like the…

181
00:14:40,625 --> 00:14:42,916
- like the AC, I… I can do that.
- Hmm?

182
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:47,541
Or… or more warm, if you're like…
if it feels chilly for you 'cause I know...

183
00:14:47,625 --> 00:14:49,833
- Okay.
- You know, women's bodies...

184
00:14:49,916 --> 00:14:51,708
Women's bodies?

185
00:14:53,625 --> 00:14:54,666
I'm good. Thank you.

186
00:14:55,250 --> 00:14:57,458
Like, I know
people get cold, so whatever...

187
00:14:57,541 --> 00:14:59,083
Yeah. Thank you.

188
00:14:59,625 --> 00:15:00,833
Yeah. I got you.

189
00:15:03,541 --> 00:15:05,875
She's gonna be pissed
if you don't open the door for her.

190
00:15:06,416 --> 00:15:09,041
Oh.
You're right. My bad. Thanks.

191
00:15:16,958 --> 00:15:20,291
Hello, Miss Moreau.
I… I'm Jay. I'll be your driver tonight.

192
00:15:20,916 --> 00:15:22,416
You're adorable.

193
00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:25,041
Do you need help with your bags?

194
00:15:25,541 --> 00:15:27,375
You don't look like a driver.

195
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,666
- Okay?
- Mm-hmm.

196
00:15:43,625 --> 00:15:45,125
Uh…

197
00:15:45,208 --> 00:15:47,500
Are you sure you know
what you're doing there, Jay?

198
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,791
Um, no, I was just trying
to put the address in.

199
00:15:50,875 --> 00:15:53,791
Except I haven't given you
the address yet, have I?

200
00:15:55,083 --> 00:15:56,875
Right. Yeah. I know.

201
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:01,208
We're hitting every one
of these parties tonight,

202
00:16:01,291 --> 00:16:03,750
and we need to get
to the last stop by morning.

203
00:16:03,833 --> 00:16:05,583
That's nonnegotiable.

204
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:07,333
Are we clear?

205
00:16:07,416 --> 00:16:08,416
Yeah.

206
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:11,208
Oh, and Jay, can you turn the air on?

207
00:16:11,291 --> 00:16:13,916
Yeah. Make it icy.

208
00:16:29,333 --> 00:16:32,208
Hey, driver. You wanna put on something
that doesn't suck?

209
00:16:32,291 --> 00:16:33,541
Yes, ma'am.

210
00:16:38,291 --> 00:16:39,416
Actually, Jay…

211
00:16:41,458 --> 00:16:42,833
let's play a game.

212
00:16:42,916 --> 00:16:46,625
What would you do if you knew
tonight was your last night on Earth?

213
00:16:46,708 --> 00:16:50,625
Wow, uh… I never really thought
about it, to be honest.

214
00:16:50,708 --> 00:16:53,125
Okay. Well, think about it.

215
00:16:53,208 --> 00:16:54,708
I mean, you must have some fantasies.

216
00:16:54,791 --> 00:16:57,375
I don't… I don't really like
to think that way, you know.

217
00:16:57,875 --> 00:16:59,500
Like, to fantasize?

218
00:17:00,125 --> 00:17:02,166
Yeah, you know, it's like,
I'm doing things today.

219
00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:05,583
I'm building things for the future.
You know what I mean?

220
00:17:05,666 --> 00:17:09,291
- I'm not sure you understand how to play.
- I do. What I'm trying to say is...

221
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:11,625
Last night on Earth, Jay.
Drugs, women, men,

222
00:17:11,708 --> 00:17:14,208
old enemies you're just waiting to pop.

223
00:17:14,291 --> 00:17:17,083
Nah, sorry,
I'm a pretty chill guy.

224
00:17:17,166 --> 00:17:19,541
You know,
I go to school, live with my <i>abuela...</i>

225
00:17:19,625 --> 00:17:21,458
You live with your <i>abuela?</i>

226
00:17:21,541 --> 00:17:23,375
- Yeah.
- That's cute.

227
00:17:23,458 --> 00:17:27,125
New game. Fuck, marry, kill.
Me, Blaire, your <i>abuela.</i>

228
00:17:28,541 --> 00:17:29,375
S… sorry, what?

229
00:17:29,458 --> 00:17:33,000
- I know you know this game.
- No, I do. I… I know this game.

230
00:17:33,083 --> 00:17:35,666
It's just, you know,
I'm trying to be professional.

231
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:39,416
- Look, Blaire. Me, the Pope, the driver.
- You're not even trying.

232
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:42,291
- Personally, I would bang me.
- Fine. Okay, you could get it.

233
00:17:42,375 --> 00:17:46,708
Kill the Pope, which I guess
puts me marrying Jay, the driver.

234
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:50,750
- He seems like husband material.
- You hear that, driver?

235
00:17:50,833 --> 00:17:53,458
Come on, fess up.
Me, Blaire, your grandma.

236
00:17:53,541 --> 00:17:55,208
I'd definitely kill you.

237
00:17:55,291 --> 00:17:58,166
Finally, he bites back.

238
00:17:58,750 --> 00:18:00,666
Maybe he's not a total dud.

239
00:18:02,083 --> 00:18:04,500
I don't know. Maybe not.

240
00:18:06,708 --> 00:18:09,083
Hey, driver. Keep your eyes on the road.

241
00:18:40,833 --> 00:18:41,708
Thanks.

242
00:18:44,458 --> 00:18:45,541
Some party.

243
00:18:46,041 --> 00:18:48,791
You wouldn't know a party
if it fucked you in the face.

244
00:19:10,875 --> 00:19:12,208
What's up, G?

245
00:19:12,291 --> 00:19:13,500
What's the word?

246
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:18,375
Three generations deep,
and I'm the one to break the peace.

247
00:19:18,458 --> 00:19:20,875
That's on him. Not us.

248
00:19:20,958 --> 00:19:25,125
Victor knows we're off-limits.
He's starting a war with Boyle Heights.

249
00:19:25,208 --> 00:19:28,458
He took Maria… to get to me.

250
00:19:30,083 --> 00:19:32,208
There's no turning back.

251
00:19:32,291 --> 00:19:33,958
We have until tomorrow morning.

252
00:19:34,791 --> 00:19:35,791
After that,

253
00:19:36,291 --> 00:19:39,500
either Victor's dead, or we are.

254
00:19:41,791 --> 00:19:43,208
Let's go put this work in.

255
00:20:32,208 --> 00:20:35,083
Back in the car, driver!

256
00:20:54,375 --> 00:20:55,416
Yo, Jay.

257
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:56,875
You want some?

258
00:20:56,958 --> 00:20:58,875
Uh, I… I can't really do that.

259
00:20:58,958 --> 00:21:00,666
- Sorry.
- You can't?

260
00:21:00,750 --> 00:21:03,083
- I can't.
- That's boring.

261
00:21:05,083 --> 00:21:05,916
Zoé!

262
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:08,666
- That's gonna be a fine.
- Oh, there's a fine?

263
00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:11,958
- Yeah.
- Don't worry, driver. We can afford it.

264
00:21:52,541 --> 00:21:53,541
Stay.

265
00:21:54,708 --> 00:21:55,625
See you soon.

266
00:22:55,083 --> 00:22:57,000
<i>Hey, it's Jay.</i>
<i>Leave a message.</i>

267
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,833
Yo, it's Benny. Um, look,
I don't know what you're up to,

268
00:23:00,916 --> 00:23:05,166
but, um, I… I think there's
something… something weird going on,

269
00:23:05,250 --> 00:23:08,500
and just whenever you get a chance,
just hit me back, aight?

270
00:23:09,458 --> 00:23:10,375
Serious.

271
00:23:27,791 --> 00:23:28,916
Whoa.

272
00:23:32,958 --> 00:23:35,750
What the… Oh my…

273
00:23:35,833 --> 00:23:38,791
Oh, no, no, no.

274
00:23:52,083 --> 00:23:53,000
No, no, no.

275
00:25:01,625 --> 00:25:02,458
Hey!

276
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:32,500
How may I help you, sir?

277
00:25:39,083 --> 00:25:40,625
Hi. Uh…

278
00:25:41,125 --> 00:25:43,000
- Sir, you are sweating.
- Oh.

279
00:25:43,083 --> 00:25:44,666
- Is everything all right?
- Yeah, yeah.

280
00:25:44,750 --> 00:25:46,541
- I, um… I was just…
- Mm-hmm.

281
00:25:46,625 --> 00:25:48,666
- I… I was outside and...
- What's that on your shirt?

282
00:25:48,750 --> 00:25:50,125
- Huh?
- Your shirt.

283
00:25:50,208 --> 00:25:51,250
I…

284
00:25:52,458 --> 00:25:53,833
I… I got, um…

285
00:25:53,916 --> 00:25:57,125
This is a members-only establishment,
so perhaps I should call somebody.

286
00:25:57,208 --> 00:26:00,083
- No, no, no, I'm fine. It's just...
- It's okay. It'll just be one second.

287
00:26:00,166 --> 00:26:03,083
No, no, no, no, hey, hey.
It's… it's okay. I just… I, um…

288
00:26:03,166 --> 00:26:06,833
Please accept
my most sincere apology, sir.

289
00:26:10,625 --> 00:26:11,458
May I?

290
00:26:14,041 --> 00:26:15,041
Yeah.

291
00:26:16,250 --> 00:26:19,083
Mmm. Will you be meeting anyone upstairs?

292
00:26:20,458 --> 00:26:22,125
Mm-hmm, yeah. I, um…

293
00:26:22,750 --> 00:26:24,750
I'm… I'm meeting the… the two girls,

294
00:26:24,833 --> 00:26:27,958
uh, Blaire and… and… and… and Zoé.

295
00:26:28,041 --> 00:26:31,041
Of course, sir.
They're with Daniel and Max as we speak.

296
00:26:33,375 --> 00:26:34,708
The owners, sir.

297
00:26:35,208 --> 00:26:36,083
- Great.
- Mm-hmm.

298
00:26:36,166 --> 00:26:38,250
- Yeah.
- Allow me to escort you to the elevator.

299
00:26:38,333 --> 00:26:39,208
- Mm-hmm, yeah.
- Mm-hmm.

300
00:26:39,291 --> 00:26:42,041
Please, I don't…
I don't… I don't have all day.

301
00:27:05,291 --> 00:27:06,916
Should you need anything at all,

302
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:10,375
there's a phone located in your room
that links directly to my desk.

303
00:27:10,458 --> 00:27:13,500
Myself or a member of my staff
will be happy to assist you.

304
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:35,000
And, please, drink responsibly.

305
00:28:06,291 --> 00:28:07,125
Hey.

306
00:28:08,083 --> 00:28:09,041
H… hey.

307
00:28:11,083 --> 00:28:13,583
- This isn't what it looks like.
- Okay. I'm just…

308
00:28:17,208 --> 00:28:18,583
Oh my God.

309
00:28:19,083 --> 00:28:20,291
He's shaking.

310
00:28:20,375 --> 00:28:22,625
I love it when they shake.

311
00:28:22,708 --> 00:28:25,333
It's so cute.

312
00:28:25,958 --> 00:28:29,166
Max over there tasted like motor oil.

313
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:33,500
I bet Jay gives good blood.

314
00:28:34,250 --> 00:28:35,833
Don't you, Jay?

315
00:28:36,375 --> 00:28:37,833
I'm not Jay.

316
00:28:39,208 --> 00:28:42,083
- What?
- I'm not Jay. My name's Benny.

317
00:28:42,166 --> 00:28:45,875
- I'm just… I'm his brother.
- I'm just covering for him.

318
00:28:49,166 --> 00:28:50,333
I knew it.

319
00:28:51,625 --> 00:28:52,958
What did I tell you?

320
00:28:53,708 --> 00:28:56,208
I knew this little shit
couldn't be Jay Perez.

321
00:28:59,041 --> 00:29:01,500
All right.

322
00:29:01,583 --> 00:29:03,250
Let's drink the driver.

323
00:29:03,333 --> 00:29:05,166
What? No, no, no, no.

324
00:29:05,250 --> 00:29:07,958
- I don't know. He could come in handy.
- Handy for what?

325
00:29:08,583 --> 00:29:10,958
I don't need someone
to hold the door for me tonight.

326
00:29:11,041 --> 00:29:13,000
- No.
- Wait, wait.

327
00:29:13,083 --> 00:29:14,875
I bet he could take us to Jay.

328
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:18,000
Benny, do you think you could do that?

329
00:29:18,083 --> 00:29:20,000
You think you could show us
where your brother is?

330
00:29:20,083 --> 00:29:23,791
That was great.

331
00:29:28,541 --> 00:29:30,000
Oh, is he okay?

332
00:29:30,875 --> 00:29:32,666
Hey, Max, buddy!

333
00:29:32,750 --> 00:29:35,791
- Did they go a little too hard on you?
- You had one thing to do.

334
00:29:35,875 --> 00:29:38,166
- Just one.
- I know. I'm sorry.

335
00:29:38,250 --> 00:29:41,250
I got a little distracted
because someone walked in on us.

336
00:29:41,333 --> 00:29:42,541
Max!

337
00:29:43,416 --> 00:29:45,125
Hey, what's wrong with him?

338
00:29:45,208 --> 00:29:46,083
Max.

339
00:29:46,666 --> 00:29:48,500
- What… what did you do?
- Max?

340
00:29:48,583 --> 00:29:49,958
Hey, Max. You okay?

341
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:54,500
Yeah, man, I'm fine.
I'm living my best life.

342
00:29:54,583 --> 00:29:56,333
Are you crazy? Is he…

343
00:29:57,375 --> 00:29:59,666
- Is he...
- He's dead. Yes, Daniel.

344
00:29:59,750 --> 00:30:02,125
Yes, he's dead.

345
00:30:02,208 --> 00:30:03,291
I killed him.

346
00:30:03,375 --> 00:30:05,041
- No, you can't do this.
- No?

347
00:30:05,125 --> 00:30:07,833
We're protected. This place is protected!

348
00:30:07,916 --> 00:30:11,791
You're protected?
How protected do you feel right now?

349
00:30:11,875 --> 00:30:13,750
Hmm?

350
00:30:13,833 --> 00:30:16,041
Blaire, finish your drink.
We're running behind schedule.

351
00:30:16,125 --> 00:30:19,791
- Hey. You stupid bitches.
- Mmm.

352
00:30:19,875 --> 00:30:23,000
They're gonna come after you for this.
The bosses will burn you alive.

353
00:30:23,083 --> 00:30:24,083
- Oh.
- Yeah.

354
00:30:24,166 --> 00:30:26,791
You can't kill in here. It's off-limits.

355
00:30:26,875 --> 00:30:28,208
Oh, are those the rules?

356
00:30:29,250 --> 00:30:30,958
You can't. You're gonna ruin this place.

357
00:30:31,041 --> 00:30:33,750
Well, that's the point.
No more happy endings.

358
00:30:33,833 --> 00:30:35,416
No, wait, hey!

359
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:37,708
Wait, no, no, no. Don't, please, wait.

360
00:30:37,791 --> 00:30:40,583
You can't kill me.
You can't. What about the truce?

361
00:30:40,666 --> 00:30:44,041
- The truce is dead, handsome.
- Wait. Wait.

362
00:31:02,166 --> 00:31:04,583
Hey, uh, officer, listen. Um, I…

363
00:31:05,083 --> 00:31:07,291
I need… I need your help. I… I got this…

364
00:31:07,375 --> 00:31:09,291
It's an emergency.
There's these two women, right?

365
00:31:09,375 --> 00:31:10,958
- And they're after me and...
- Two women?

366
00:31:11,041 --> 00:31:12,333
- Mm-hmm.
- After you?

367
00:31:12,416 --> 00:31:16,291
Yeah, I've been… I've been driving them
around all night, but I think that's...

368
00:31:16,375 --> 00:31:18,250
Is there anything
you want to tell me about, son?

369
00:31:18,333 --> 00:31:21,791
- No, listen, I'm trying...
- How much have you had to drink tonight?

370
00:31:21,875 --> 00:31:23,333
- I haven't drank anything.
- Any drugs?

371
00:31:23,416 --> 00:31:24,541
- No drugs.
- Weapons on you?

372
00:31:24,625 --> 00:31:27,250
Listen, there's
this secret floor in there, okay?

373
00:31:27,333 --> 00:31:29,541
There's this crazy shit
that's going on in there.

374
00:31:29,625 --> 00:31:32,458
I need you to call backup.
I need you to call everyone, call...

375
00:31:32,541 --> 00:31:34,000
Exactly what'd you see up there?

376
00:31:36,416 --> 00:31:39,708
They killed these two guys, all right?
They were drinking their blood, man.

377
00:31:39,791 --> 00:31:42,125
Okay, that's enough.
Put your hands behind your back.

378
00:31:42,208 --> 00:31:44,000
Put your hands behind your back!

379
00:31:44,083 --> 00:31:44,916
Hey!

380
00:31:47,916 --> 00:31:50,125
Come on. Take… take me to jail right now.

381
00:31:50,208 --> 00:31:52,041
Get me… get me out of here.

382
00:31:52,541 --> 00:31:53,500
Mm-hmm. Let's go.

383
00:31:54,083 --> 00:31:56,375
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa. No, no.

384
00:31:56,458 --> 00:31:59,000
- What happens upstairs stays upstairs.
- No. Okay.

385
00:31:59,083 --> 00:32:01,583
- You should know better.
- Yeah, I'm not gonna say...

386
00:32:01,666 --> 00:32:04,625
- Get in the trunk. In the trunk!
- I won't say nothing!

387
00:32:04,708 --> 00:32:08,250
- I'm not gonna say anything!
- Excuse me, Officer Anderson.

388
00:32:13,333 --> 00:32:14,291
You girls.

389
00:32:14,375 --> 00:32:16,250
Yes, us girls.

390
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:21,833
This kid is saying
you killed two men upstairs.

391
00:32:21,916 --> 00:32:24,041
- That can't be right, right?
- Of course not.

392
00:32:24,125 --> 00:32:26,583
Benny here has no idea what he saw.

393
00:32:26,666 --> 00:32:27,625
Do you, Benny?

394
00:32:28,208 --> 00:32:31,375
We just gave those boys
the best suck they're ever gonna get.

395
00:32:32,291 --> 00:32:34,000
Let him go. He's ours.

396
00:32:35,875 --> 00:32:37,333
Yeah. Victor know about this?

397
00:32:37,416 --> 00:32:38,958
What do you think, dipshit?

398
00:32:39,041 --> 00:32:42,250
We're just making our collections.
Business as usual.

399
00:32:42,333 --> 00:32:45,416
- Well, I didn't get a call.
- Oh, you didn't get a call?

400
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:47,333
Maybe you're not important enough
to get a call.

401
00:32:47,416 --> 00:32:50,000
Yeah, maybe I should just call Victor now.

402
00:32:50,083 --> 00:32:51,625
Why don't you do that?

403
00:32:51,708 --> 00:32:56,750
I'm sure Victor would love to hear
from his favorite little piggy.

404
00:32:58,250 --> 00:32:59,583
Hand him over.

405
00:33:05,375 --> 00:33:06,833
Okay, all right. Fine.

406
00:33:14,500 --> 00:33:16,125
Go turn the car around.

407
00:33:20,833 --> 00:33:21,666
Huh? Hey!

408
00:33:23,583 --> 00:33:25,291
No more funny games.

409
00:34:24,666 --> 00:34:29,458
Wait! No.
Don't go! Wait! Don't leave!

410
00:35:00,750 --> 00:35:01,833
Yeah.

411
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,291
Yeah, you count this out?

412
00:35:36,416 --> 00:35:38,041
Back in the car, driver.

413
00:35:39,541 --> 00:35:40,541
Hmm.

414
00:36:25,333 --> 00:36:27,125
Don't get up. I know where the bar is.

415
00:36:27,208 --> 00:36:30,375
- What the hell are you doing here?
- I'm having a drink with my bosses, Eva.

416
00:36:33,375 --> 00:36:35,000
Better make it a good one.

417
00:36:37,750 --> 00:36:40,708
- It's gonna be your last.
- I'll keep that in mind.

418
00:36:41,291 --> 00:36:44,666
We told you what would happen
if you stepped foot in Boyle Heights,

419
00:36:44,750 --> 00:36:47,000
and yet, here you are,

420
00:36:47,083 --> 00:36:48,541
being reckless as ever.

421
00:36:48,625 --> 00:36:49,833
Drinking blood cocktails

422
00:36:49,916 --> 00:36:52,250
on white upholstery,
and I'm the reckless one?

423
00:36:52,333 --> 00:36:56,291
You need to remember your place,
Victor. You're middle management.

424
00:36:56,375 --> 00:36:59,416
Give me one reason
why I shouldn't call Martin right now.

425
00:37:01,541 --> 00:37:05,125
- Because I've had a change of heart.
- What heart?

426
00:37:06,333 --> 00:37:07,583
I deserve that.

427
00:37:20,958 --> 00:37:22,958
This view never gets old.

428
00:37:23,041 --> 00:37:26,458
Yeah. But now we're gonna have to ruin it
with your dead body.

429
00:37:28,458 --> 00:37:30,750
I should have let her do
what she wanted with you.

430
00:37:30,833 --> 00:37:33,916
I wanted to barbecue you
the moment you fed outside the lines.

431
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,708
But Grace said that would be impulsive.

432
00:37:36,791 --> 00:37:39,458
I think the word I used was tacky.

433
00:37:40,291 --> 00:37:41,625
Well, I'm glad you didn't.

434
00:37:42,125 --> 00:37:45,458
I know you've never trusted me,
never given me any real power.

435
00:37:45,541 --> 00:37:48,166
But if you hadn't tried
to run me out of my own city,

436
00:37:48,791 --> 00:37:50,666
I wouldn't be seeing so clearly now.

437
00:37:50,750 --> 00:37:53,250
- Are you on something?
- You violated the truce.

438
00:37:53,875 --> 00:37:56,208
It's the one thing that's kept
our kind safe all these years,

439
00:37:56,291 --> 00:37:58,416
and you just pissed on it.

440
00:38:02,458 --> 00:38:06,666
For years we've been told
who to feed on and where

441
00:38:06,750 --> 00:38:09,291
and treating humans
like they're our equals.

442
00:38:09,833 --> 00:38:11,541
It started to feel like a prison.

443
00:38:12,375 --> 00:38:15,625
So I got frustrated
and did something impulsive.

444
00:38:17,166 --> 00:38:18,250
Should we say

445
00:38:19,875 --> 00:38:21,000
tacky?

446
00:38:21,083 --> 00:38:22,000
Tacky?

447
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:26,500
You fed where you weren't supposed to
and started a war with Jay Perez.

448
00:38:26,583 --> 00:38:29,875
If he comes for us,
Boyle Heights will follow.

449
00:38:29,958 --> 00:38:33,083
Do you like your fancy clothes
and your concrete mansion?

450
00:38:34,333 --> 00:38:38,166
Because if we get exposed,
that all goes away. For all of us.

451
00:38:39,166 --> 00:38:40,125
I know.

452
00:38:40,916 --> 00:38:42,833
I put you two in a terrible position.

453
00:38:44,041 --> 00:38:46,208
Do you think that I don't get frustrated?

454
00:38:46,916 --> 00:38:51,208
Do you think that when my pool boy
leaves a leaf in the pool,

455
00:38:51,291 --> 00:38:54,958
that I don't wanna string him upside down
and suck him dry?

456
00:38:55,666 --> 00:38:59,625
But if I pitch a fit every time
somebody pisses me off,

457
00:38:59,708 --> 00:39:00,791
what does that make me?

458
00:39:00,875 --> 00:39:01,958
A man.

459
00:39:02,041 --> 00:39:03,250
Stupid as shit.

460
00:39:03,333 --> 00:39:04,333
Like I said.

461
00:39:06,666 --> 00:39:07,625
I'm sorry.

462
00:39:09,875 --> 00:39:11,125
No, a ban is a ban.

463
00:39:11,208 --> 00:39:14,208
You're gonna have to do a lot better
than that if you want me to reverse it.

464
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:18,208
You know, forever is a very long time.

465
00:39:18,875 --> 00:39:21,458
Give it 40, 50 years.

466
00:39:21,541 --> 00:39:25,000
Who knows? Maybe this will blow over,
and you'll be able to come back.

467
00:39:25,750 --> 00:39:28,708
Oh, I think you've misunderstood.

468
00:39:29,666 --> 00:39:31,083
I'm not going anywhere.

469
00:39:33,458 --> 00:39:35,666
In fact, my girls
are down there right now,

470
00:39:36,583 --> 00:39:39,958
ripping your entire network apart
one neck at a time.

471
00:39:40,041 --> 00:39:45,083
So, everything you see belongs to me.

472
00:39:46,291 --> 00:39:48,250
After I kill both of you, of course.

473
00:39:49,250 --> 00:39:50,750
Martin!

474
00:39:50,833 --> 00:39:54,333
I, uh, think you might
have to speak up a little.

475
00:40:01,333 --> 00:40:03,875
This is not real. This is…

476
00:40:03,958 --> 00:40:06,458
Come on. She's here, then she's there.

477
00:40:12,708 --> 00:40:14,625
- You need to calm down.
- Calm? Be calm?

478
00:40:14,708 --> 00:40:16,166
- You want me to calm down?
- Yeah.

479
00:40:16,250 --> 00:40:17,916
- I'm calm.
- Oh, you're calm?

480
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,125
- Yeah. This is me calm.
- This is you calm?

481
00:40:20,208 --> 00:40:22,708
- You seem kind of worked up.
- What do you want me to do, huh?

482
00:40:22,791 --> 00:40:27,750
I'm here… I'm here in this car with…
with you and whatever the hell you are.

483
00:40:27,833 --> 00:40:29,166
Oh.

484
00:40:29,250 --> 00:40:31,375
- This is… this is stupid.
- Oh, wow.

485
00:40:31,458 --> 00:40:33,041
- I… I honestly...
- So dumb.

486
00:40:33,125 --> 00:40:35,250
I don't expect people to understand.

487
00:40:35,333 --> 00:40:37,208
- It's a lot. It's a lot.
- Yeah. Yeah.

488
00:40:37,833 --> 00:40:39,708
Yeah, I mean, especially for you.

489
00:40:40,875 --> 00:40:42,666
What is that supposed to mean, huh?

490
00:40:43,708 --> 00:40:45,458
It means you're a kid.

491
00:40:45,541 --> 00:40:46,458
Like, you…

492
00:40:47,958 --> 00:40:51,958
You… you think majoring in economics
is gonna solve all your problems?

493
00:40:52,041 --> 00:40:54,166
Do you think
that this is how the world works?

494
00:40:54,750 --> 00:40:56,041
Okay. All right.

495
00:40:56,125 --> 00:40:57,083
Well…

496
00:40:57,791 --> 00:40:59,625
Don't worry.

497
00:41:00,708 --> 00:41:01,916
It'll all be over soon.

498
00:41:02,708 --> 00:41:04,500
All over? All over? How?

499
00:41:07,166 --> 00:41:09,958
Is… is my brother… is he like a, um…

500
00:41:13,125 --> 00:41:14,791
No, it's not like that.

501
00:41:14,875 --> 00:41:17,083
Then what's it like, then? What's it like?

502
00:41:17,833 --> 00:41:21,750
Let's just say your people
and my people don't really get along.

503
00:41:24,625 --> 00:41:26,250
Who do you think runs the city?

504
00:41:28,375 --> 00:41:29,458
Cops?

505
00:41:29,541 --> 00:41:30,791
Politicians?

506
00:41:31,750 --> 00:41:32,708
We do.

507
00:41:33,541 --> 00:41:34,416
We?

508
00:41:36,333 --> 00:41:37,416
Right.

509
00:41:37,500 --> 00:41:40,833
And… and our kind, like your kind,
answer to leaders.

510
00:41:42,083 --> 00:41:43,125
All right.

511
00:41:43,208 --> 00:41:46,583
There are five bosses that control
most of the major territories of LA.

512
00:41:46,666 --> 00:41:50,625
- It sounds like the mob.
- Please. We're not amateurs.

513
00:41:50,708 --> 00:41:52,541
Victor's, what, like, your boss?

514
00:41:53,375 --> 00:41:54,291
Your boyfriend?

515
00:41:55,250 --> 00:41:57,000
Oh, twist. Benny's the jealous type.

516
00:41:57,083 --> 00:42:00,416
No, no, no. I just…
I don't… I don't know what's going on.

517
00:42:01,291 --> 00:42:03,875
So, Zoé and Victor are together.

518
00:42:04,416 --> 00:42:06,000
And then, Zoé's my girl.

519
00:42:06,625 --> 00:42:08,208
So, she and I manage money

520
00:42:08,291 --> 00:42:10,458
at the different businesses
and blood clubs.

521
00:42:10,541 --> 00:42:12,500
- We manage the...
- Blood clubs?

522
00:42:13,250 --> 00:42:16,333
Yeah, but Victor's sick
of not having any real power,

523
00:42:16,416 --> 00:42:20,291
so tonight, we're making our move.

524
00:42:20,875 --> 00:42:23,250
The problem is you can't make a move
against one of the bosses

525
00:42:23,333 --> 00:42:26,958
without the rest of them
coming for your head unless you...

526
00:42:27,041 --> 00:42:30,083
Unless you take them all out
at the same time. Same night.

527
00:42:30,666 --> 00:42:31,666
Exactly.

528
00:42:32,666 --> 00:42:34,166
And… and my brother?

529
00:42:34,833 --> 00:42:36,875
Jay's crew runs Boyle Heights.

530
00:42:37,750 --> 00:42:41,541
They know what we are and how to kill us.

531
00:42:42,833 --> 00:42:44,958
Victor thought he could use him.

532
00:42:45,791 --> 00:42:49,083
Just turn Jay's crew loose on the bosses.

533
00:42:49,916 --> 00:42:52,958
Jay kindly instructed him to go to hell,

534
00:42:53,625 --> 00:42:56,500
which Victor didn't like very much,
so the plan was for us

535
00:42:56,583 --> 00:42:59,541
to bring Jay to Victor
after all of this was done.

536
00:43:00,541 --> 00:43:01,791
That was the plan

537
00:43:02,708 --> 00:43:04,375
until you showed up.

538
00:43:04,458 --> 00:43:08,500
So, Benny, you know
where your brother is tonight?

539
00:43:25,708 --> 00:43:28,250
Hey, no, you can't smoke that in here.
It's gonna…

540
00:43:29,125 --> 00:43:30,625
It's gonna get in the leather.

541
00:43:36,250 --> 00:43:37,166
That's funny.

542
00:43:38,791 --> 00:43:39,875
Mmm.

543
00:43:41,166 --> 00:43:42,291
You wanna hit this?

544
00:43:42,875 --> 00:43:45,875
- Honestly, it might make you feel better.
- No, I'm… I'm okay.

545
00:43:48,458 --> 00:43:50,125
Here. Let me.

546
00:44:04,791 --> 00:44:06,125
So, how did it go?

547
00:44:06,208 --> 00:44:08,333
<i>Well, my shirt is ruined.</i>

548
00:44:08,416 --> 00:44:10,416
<i>I think we might actually pull this off.</i>

549
00:44:10,500 --> 00:44:11,458
Yeah.

550
00:44:11,541 --> 00:44:13,000
Three bosses down.

551
00:44:13,083 --> 00:44:14,708
<i>And two to go.</i>

552
00:44:14,791 --> 00:44:17,250
Ah, you should've seen
the looks on their faces.

553
00:44:17,333 --> 00:44:19,416
<i> I wish</i>
<i>I could've been there with you.</i>

554
00:44:20,416 --> 00:44:22,000
<i>So, how's Jay?</i>

555
00:44:22,958 --> 00:44:24,083
Yeah.

556
00:44:24,166 --> 00:44:26,458
About that.
I… I need to tell you something.

557
00:44:26,541 --> 00:44:27,916
<i> What is it?</i>

558
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:32,208
We, um, got his little brother instead.

559
00:44:34,833 --> 00:44:37,166
<i>I'm sorry. We didn't know.</i>

560
00:44:37,250 --> 00:44:38,583
It's okay, baby.

561
00:44:39,958 --> 00:44:41,750
It's okay. We can use the brother.

562
00:44:42,583 --> 00:44:43,416
Really?

563
00:44:43,500 --> 00:44:47,375
<i>Really. It makes it more fun.</i>
<i>Think of him like insurance.</i>

564
00:44:47,958 --> 00:44:49,041
<i>Okay, babe.</i>

565
00:44:49,958 --> 00:44:52,791
- Do you think he gives good blood?
<i>- Yeah.</i>

566
00:44:53,416 --> 00:44:55,708
I think he gives real good blood.

567
00:44:56,250 --> 00:44:59,625
I'll take care of Jay.
I don't want you to get distracted.

568
00:45:01,625 --> 00:45:05,083
Clear downtown and Venice.
Then the city is ours.

569
00:45:05,958 --> 00:45:08,250
We can't let them regroup after tonight.

570
00:45:15,583 --> 00:45:17,958
You sure about this? I don't like him.

571
00:45:18,625 --> 00:45:20,833
I don't even like breathing
the same air as this<i> vato.</i>

572
00:45:20,916 --> 00:45:22,666
This is the only chance we got.

573
00:45:23,500 --> 00:45:25,625
What if we don't know where Victor's at?

574
00:45:26,333 --> 00:45:27,833
Gio made Victor.

575
00:45:28,583 --> 00:45:29,541
He'll know.

576
00:45:32,041 --> 00:45:33,750
- I want him alive.
- All right.

577
00:45:49,375 --> 00:45:50,458
Shit.

578
00:45:51,416 --> 00:45:53,291
What the hell happened in here?

579
00:46:01,833 --> 00:46:03,166
Sweep the house.

580
00:46:04,125 --> 00:46:06,041
Split up. Three and three.

581
00:46:06,125 --> 00:46:07,166
Watch out.

582
00:46:27,250 --> 00:46:30,750
Don't move. Move, I gotta put
this knife through your heart.

583
00:46:31,291 --> 00:46:33,291
I don't think you want that, do you, Gio?

584
00:46:33,375 --> 00:46:37,000
Right, baby. I don't want that.

585
00:46:37,083 --> 00:46:38,416
Yo, what the hell happened to you?

586
00:46:38,500 --> 00:46:40,958
Oh, don't look at me.
I look hideous.

587
00:46:41,541 --> 00:46:43,208
- You know what I need?
- Hmm?

588
00:46:43,291 --> 00:46:46,458
I need some blood.
Can you get me some blood, Jay?

589
00:46:46,541 --> 00:46:48,500
First, you gotta tell me
where Victor's at tonight.

590
00:46:48,583 --> 00:46:50,375
That snake.

591
00:46:50,458 --> 00:46:52,875
He's coming for all of us.

592
00:46:52,958 --> 00:46:56,000
All the bosses.
All the territories.

593
00:46:56,541 --> 00:46:58,250
He's clearing the board.

594
00:46:58,333 --> 00:46:59,625
Victor did this?

595
00:46:59,708 --> 00:47:01,041
His girls did this.

596
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,458
- You know the ones.
- Haven't had the pleasure.

597
00:47:05,125 --> 00:47:08,541
His little monsters
left me like this to suffer.

598
00:47:08,625 --> 00:47:11,083
Hey. Hey, wake up.
Rise and shine, come on.

599
00:47:11,166 --> 00:47:13,208
- I'm awake.
- Where were they going?

600
00:47:13,291 --> 00:47:15,416
I'll tell you if you give me some blood.

601
00:47:15,500 --> 00:47:17,208
You gotta tell me what they said first.

602
00:47:18,416 --> 00:47:21,000
Three Kings.

603
00:47:21,500 --> 00:47:23,750
Get the boys. We're going downtown.

604
00:47:23,833 --> 00:47:26,875
But first, give me some blood!

605
00:47:52,583 --> 00:47:54,000
Can you hear that?

606
00:47:57,458 --> 00:47:58,958
What did I just smoke? I…

607
00:47:59,541 --> 00:48:00,541
I feel weird.

608
00:48:01,041 --> 00:48:02,375
Angel dust.

609
00:48:03,041 --> 00:48:05,250
- What?
- Relax.

610
00:48:05,333 --> 00:48:07,208
- I'm joking.
- Are you?

611
00:48:07,291 --> 00:48:10,250
Uh, maybe. Maybe not.

612
00:48:11,625 --> 00:48:13,458
Ask Blaire. She rolled it.

613
00:48:16,416 --> 00:48:18,416
That girl really needs to get laid.

614
00:48:20,875 --> 00:48:25,000
Well, that's a different kind of service
than the one this car company offers, but…

615
00:48:26,791 --> 00:48:28,708
That's good, Benny.

616
00:48:29,541 --> 00:48:31,166
Can I call you Benny Boy?

617
00:48:31,916 --> 00:48:32,750
No.

618
00:48:36,041 --> 00:48:39,083
You know, it's not your fault
that she likes you.

619
00:48:39,833 --> 00:48:43,708
She likes everyone,
so don't feel special or anything.

620
00:48:43,791 --> 00:48:47,250
Yeah, I know,
it's not… it's not like that.

621
00:48:47,333 --> 00:48:50,250
I… I mean, I'm not…
I'm not saying she isn't attractive.

622
00:48:50,333 --> 00:48:53,833
I'm just not really looking
for a relationship right now.

623
00:48:53,916 --> 00:48:55,250
Is he looking at me?

624
00:48:57,583 --> 00:48:58,750
Who?

625
00:48:58,833 --> 00:48:59,916
The clerk.

626
00:49:00,875 --> 00:49:04,041
I… I don't think so.

627
00:49:04,125 --> 00:49:05,083
You sure?

628
00:49:05,166 --> 00:49:06,083
Yeah, you know.

629
00:49:06,583 --> 00:49:08,541
Nobody's looking at you, Zoé.

630
00:49:08,625 --> 00:49:09,875
He's calling someone.

631
00:49:11,208 --> 00:49:12,041
Zoé.

632
00:49:12,125 --> 00:49:14,666
Zoé, chill, yo. Hey. Chill.

633
00:49:14,750 --> 00:49:18,166
<i>…three bodies appeared
to have been drained of all blood.</i>

634
00:49:18,250 --> 00:49:19,583
Wait.

635
00:49:19,666 --> 00:49:20,875
Just a slushy?

636
00:49:20,958 --> 00:49:23,333
- Yeah, just the slushy.
- Okay.

637
00:49:23,416 --> 00:49:25,708
- Is that…
- Okay, that's gonna be two...

638
00:49:27,833 --> 00:49:29,750
Who was on the phone?

639
00:49:29,833 --> 00:49:31,666
- Do we really have to do this?
- Take the money!

640
00:49:31,750 --> 00:49:33,666
Get out of here, okay?
I don't want any trouble!

641
00:49:33,750 --> 00:49:34,833
You a tattletale?

642
00:49:34,916 --> 00:49:37,625
What? You're insane!

643
00:49:37,708 --> 00:49:40,208
- Get her off of me! Do something!
- Just do what she says, man.

644
00:49:40,291 --> 00:49:42,625
- Who was on the phone?
- It was my mom!

645
00:49:42,708 --> 00:49:46,500
Okay? She just wanted me to pick up
more cat food on the way home from work.

646
00:49:46,583 --> 00:49:50,291
I swear to God. I just…
Jesus Christ, are those…

647
00:49:50,375 --> 00:49:51,416
Shut him up!

648
00:49:51,500 --> 00:49:53,625
Shut him up?
What do you mean, shut him up? No!

649
00:49:55,833 --> 00:49:58,708
That's my girl.

650
00:49:58,791 --> 00:50:00,333
Let's go.

651
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:05,833
What?

652
00:50:05,916 --> 00:50:07,791
What is wrong with you?

653
00:50:08,416 --> 00:50:11,875
You can't be alive for 200 years
and not go a little crazy.

654
00:50:43,250 --> 00:50:45,625
What should we do with Benny?

655
00:50:45,708 --> 00:50:47,875
I mean,
we can't just leave him in the car.

656
00:50:47,958 --> 00:50:50,666
Hey, so, um, listen,
I… I got this idea, right?

657
00:50:50,750 --> 00:50:53,250
And I… I was thinking,
maybe why don't I just go?

658
00:50:53,333 --> 00:50:55,416
You guys can just take the car,

659
00:50:55,500 --> 00:50:59,000
and… and… and… and I'll find my way home.
I'll find a bus.

660
00:50:59,083 --> 00:51:01,375
- It sounds like you're trying to ditch us.
- No, I'm not...

661
00:51:01,458 --> 00:51:05,833
Hey, you know what? I actually think
that's a really smart idea.

662
00:51:05,916 --> 00:51:07,083
Yeah?

663
00:51:07,166 --> 00:51:08,125
Yeah.

664
00:51:08,208 --> 00:51:11,250
Yeah. You know,
'cause, you know, all… all this shit,

665
00:51:11,333 --> 00:51:13,666
I'm not gonna say nothing about all this.

666
00:51:13,750 --> 00:51:17,958
I just think this is a time where I feel
like we should go our separate ways,

667
00:51:18,041 --> 00:51:21,166
and… and believe me, it was…
it was great meeting you guys, you know.

668
00:51:21,250 --> 00:51:24,708
- It was great meeting you too.
- And the secrets, they're safe with me.

669
00:51:24,791 --> 00:51:26,333
- It's me, you know.
- Okay.

670
00:51:26,416 --> 00:51:28,416
Well, if he says
he's not gonna say anything,

671
00:51:28,500 --> 00:51:31,000
then we can trust him.

672
00:51:31,083 --> 00:51:31,958
Right?

673
00:51:32,041 --> 00:51:34,666
Sweet. Uh, okay, great. I mean...

674
00:51:34,750 --> 00:51:37,375
You're gonna stick around
a little while longer, Benny Boy.

675
00:51:37,458 --> 00:51:39,583
We're not quite through.

676
00:51:39,666 --> 00:51:42,833
You remember what I did
to that guy at the hotel?

677
00:51:45,458 --> 00:51:48,166
I tore his neck open like a bag of candy.

678
00:51:48,666 --> 00:51:51,625
If you do anything stupid inside,

679
00:51:52,375 --> 00:51:54,541
I'll start stacking bodies.

680
00:51:55,541 --> 00:51:57,666
I think what she's trying to say,

681
00:51:57,750 --> 00:52:00,375
Benny, is we would love
if you came with us.

682
00:52:01,208 --> 00:52:02,125
Good?

683
00:52:03,041 --> 00:52:05,875
Fun! Fun!

684
00:52:08,416 --> 00:52:10,791
Hey, uh, your friend over there?

685
00:52:10,875 --> 00:52:13,291
Yeah, she's insane.
I'm talking next-level crazy.

686
00:52:13,375 --> 00:52:15,958
Yeah. You wanna stay out of her way. Okay?

687
00:52:16,041 --> 00:52:18,291
I gotta get out of here.
I can't do this shit.

688
00:52:18,791 --> 00:52:21,791
I need you to be smart. All right?
If you do anything stupid,

689
00:52:21,875 --> 00:52:24,375
like try and run or tell anyone about us,

690
00:52:24,458 --> 00:52:28,250
I'm gonna have to kill you. Okay?
And I don't want to have to do that.

691
00:52:28,333 --> 00:52:29,708
- Bruce!
- Hey.

692
00:52:29,791 --> 00:52:33,125
You don't want to have to kill me.
Great, I mean, that's fantastic.

693
00:52:33,208 --> 00:52:34,500
I'm looking out for you.

694
00:52:34,583 --> 00:52:37,916
- You call this looking out for somebody?
- Benny! Come on.

695
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:39,750
- Hey.
- Excuse me.

696
00:52:42,125 --> 00:52:43,666
- Benny?
- Go on, man.

697
00:52:43,750 --> 00:52:44,833
Oh, no way.

698
00:52:45,375 --> 00:52:48,666
Hey, um, do you think
you could help us out?

699
00:52:49,250 --> 00:52:51,875
You know, tell them
that we're your friends.

700
00:52:51,958 --> 00:52:53,750
Like, we're with you or something?

701
00:52:53,833 --> 00:52:55,000
Please?

702
00:52:55,791 --> 00:52:58,083
Sorry, I don't know. I… I just, uh…

703
00:52:58,166 --> 00:53:01,166
He can't help you because he is the help.

704
00:53:01,250 --> 00:53:04,458
I mean, look at him.
Looks like a butler or something.

705
00:53:04,541 --> 00:53:05,666
Uh…

706
00:53:05,750 --> 00:53:07,083
Oh shit.

707
00:53:07,166 --> 00:53:09,250
I was right?

708
00:53:34,875 --> 00:53:36,708
Benny has his hands full tonight.

709
00:53:38,166 --> 00:53:40,458
Maybe find someone else to leech onto.

710
00:53:41,708 --> 00:53:43,083
Do us a favor.

711
00:53:43,166 --> 00:53:45,375
Send the Gen Z
off to the back of the line.

712
00:53:46,166 --> 00:53:47,791
Back of the line. Let's go.

713
00:53:47,875 --> 00:53:49,083
- You kidding?
- Wait. No.

714
00:53:49,166 --> 00:53:51,208
- You heard me. Not tonight.
- Look, no...

715
00:53:57,041 --> 00:53:58,333
What are you looking at?

716
00:53:58,958 --> 00:54:01,458
I don't think
I've ever met anybody like you.

717
00:54:02,708 --> 00:54:05,833
Well, don't get weird.
I was just trying to make you look cool.

718
00:54:06,708 --> 00:54:08,750
Yeah, well, it worked.

719
00:54:10,250 --> 00:54:12,416
I don't know why you care what they think.

720
00:54:12,500 --> 00:54:13,333
I don't.

721
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:17,166
You're never gonna remember their faces.
They're insignificant.

722
00:54:17,250 --> 00:54:18,666
What does that make me?

723
00:54:19,250 --> 00:54:21,125
I guess we're gonna have to find out.

724
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:34,041
Whoa.

725
00:54:36,125 --> 00:54:37,166
Busy night.

726
00:54:37,250 --> 00:54:39,708
Yeah.
And not a lot of friendly faces.

727
00:54:39,791 --> 00:54:41,375
Let's keep this cool and quiet.

728
00:54:41,458 --> 00:54:44,041
- I hate going in quiet.
- Zoé.

729
00:54:44,125 --> 00:54:46,250
You wanna get the bag, I'll get Big Lou?

730
00:54:46,333 --> 00:54:47,416
Mm-hmm.

731
00:54:48,375 --> 00:54:50,583
It might get a little messy in there.

732
00:54:51,583 --> 00:54:54,958
Drink up. You won't feel a thing.

733
00:54:59,291 --> 00:55:01,458
There'll be
a lot of sharp teeth in there.

734
00:55:01,541 --> 00:55:04,333
Nobody makes a move
until we see Victor's girls, all right?

735
00:55:04,833 --> 00:55:05,791
Y'all hear that?

736
00:55:30,541 --> 00:55:31,958
Good evening, ladies.

737
00:55:32,041 --> 00:55:33,916
Who are you? Where's Big Lou?

738
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:35,875
Big Lou is no longer with us.

739
00:55:37,541 --> 00:55:39,083
Don't you recognize me?

740
00:55:40,750 --> 00:55:42,666
I don't think we've had the pleasure.

741
00:56:00,500 --> 00:56:03,125
I don't like this. We should move.

742
00:56:04,750 --> 00:56:06,625
We're not going anywhere yet.

743
00:56:08,125 --> 00:56:10,458
Lost a lot of friends
to things like you.

744
00:56:11,958 --> 00:56:13,083
You don't remember me?

745
00:56:13,791 --> 00:56:15,041
Remember what?

746
00:56:15,125 --> 00:56:19,500
I gave you that,
but I didn't get to finish the job.

747
00:56:19,583 --> 00:56:21,791
LA was always off-limits.

748
00:56:23,125 --> 00:56:25,250
Yeah, I think it's brave
what you're doing,

749
00:56:25,750 --> 00:56:27,750
stepping out on your own like this.

750
00:56:27,833 --> 00:56:30,208
But, if you break the rules,

751
00:56:30,291 --> 00:56:32,791
you lose certain protections.

752
00:56:32,875 --> 00:56:37,416
I mean, with the truce falling apart,
it's open season on you freaks.

753
00:56:38,583 --> 00:56:39,625
See my friend here?

754
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:44,375
She can drain your whole body
before you even pull the trigger.

755
00:56:46,083 --> 00:56:48,708
You think I'm here alone?

756
00:56:57,250 --> 00:56:58,416
Oh…

757
00:56:59,125 --> 00:57:00,541
What were you saying?

758
00:57:53,666 --> 00:57:55,791
Ah. Look at them.

759
00:57:56,625 --> 00:57:57,958
For once,

760
00:57:59,583 --> 00:58:00,708
they're helpless.

761
00:58:08,541 --> 00:58:09,750
Kill them.

762
00:58:39,375 --> 00:58:40,958
Who still uses crossbows?

763
00:58:42,541 --> 00:58:43,708
Night Legion.

764
00:58:48,791 --> 00:58:51,583
- What?
- You asked who still uses crossbows.

765
00:58:51,666 --> 00:58:54,791
Night Legion does.
They like to hunt things like us.

766
00:58:54,875 --> 00:58:56,625
They've been at it for centuries.

767
00:58:57,416 --> 00:59:02,458
And Benny, like, totally bottles them
in the face, apparently.

768
00:59:02,541 --> 00:59:03,666
Yes, he does.

769
00:59:04,250 --> 00:59:08,083
Come on.
These scumbags are like cockroaches.

770
00:59:09,625 --> 00:59:12,125
When there's one, there's many.

771
01:00:11,250 --> 01:00:12,250
Benny!

772
01:00:20,500 --> 01:00:21,791
Is there a problem?

773
01:00:21,875 --> 01:00:24,166
- You know you're not allowed to be here.
- Move.

774
01:00:24,958 --> 01:00:26,083
No.

775
01:00:41,375 --> 01:00:42,625
Oh shit!

776
01:00:48,916 --> 01:00:51,833
- We gotta get off the streets.
- Yeah, we need to lay low.

777
01:00:51,916 --> 01:00:53,875
Is there some place safe you could take us?

778
01:00:53,958 --> 01:00:55,833
No. We're not going anywhere
until I find out

779
01:00:55,916 --> 01:00:58,000
where this Victor is
and what he wants from my brother.

780
01:00:58,083 --> 01:00:59,541
Well, look at you.

781
01:00:59,625 --> 01:01:02,708
Benny Boy. Making demands
like he's running the show tonight.

782
01:01:03,208 --> 01:01:04,583
Yeah. Yeah, I am.

783
01:01:04,666 --> 01:01:07,375
I like you, Benny.
I think you're kind of sweet,

784
01:01:07,458 --> 01:01:10,083
so I'm gonna let you in
on a little secret.

785
01:01:10,166 --> 01:01:13,750
Victor's gonna find Jay tonight,
and when he does, well…

786
01:01:13,833 --> 01:01:15,208
Well? Well, what?

787
01:01:15,291 --> 01:01:18,625
Well, if you stick with us,
then maybe we could get to Jay first,

788
01:01:18,708 --> 01:01:21,333
and we could convince Victor
to go easy on him.

789
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:23,375
So, Benny, what's it gonna be?

790
01:01:23,458 --> 01:01:25,416
You wanna see your brother,
or you wanna piss off?

791
01:01:25,500 --> 01:01:26,750
Shit!

792
01:01:28,166 --> 01:01:29,000
Run!

793
01:01:43,708 --> 01:01:46,250
Come on! Try and get me, dickheads!

794
01:02:08,041 --> 01:02:09,125
Crazy night, huh?

795
01:02:11,791 --> 01:02:13,583
Tell him to put his gear down.

796
01:02:18,166 --> 01:02:19,375
It's all right.

797
01:02:20,041 --> 01:02:23,666
You see the light now, don't you?
I heard what they did to your girl.

798
01:02:24,250 --> 01:02:28,166
I know what that's like.
We all do. That's why we're out here.

799
01:02:28,250 --> 01:02:30,000
We got resources. We got a network.

800
01:02:30,083 --> 01:02:32,708
Wake up, Jay.
You can't beat them on your own.

801
01:02:33,375 --> 01:02:34,875
Yeah, I don't wanna beat them.

802
01:02:36,166 --> 01:02:37,166
I want Victor.

803
01:02:39,083 --> 01:02:39,958
Okay.

804
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:42,583
If you survive the night,

805
01:02:43,875 --> 01:02:45,083
come find me.

806
01:02:54,083 --> 01:02:55,416
Hey, uh, Benny?

807
01:02:57,083 --> 01:02:58,875
Are you sure that we're safe here?

808
01:02:59,500 --> 01:03:02,583
Yeah, of course. Nowhere safer.
I've lived here my whole life.

809
01:03:02,666 --> 01:03:05,250
- I know, I just meant maybe...
- Listen, um…

810
01:03:05,333 --> 01:03:08,208
So, my grandma works nights,
but sometimes she comes home early.

811
01:03:08,291 --> 01:03:12,083
So, all I'm asking
is that you guys be quiet, please.

812
01:03:12,166 --> 01:03:13,625
- I got it. Yes.
- You got it?

813
01:03:13,708 --> 01:03:16,083
We will be on our best behavior.

814
01:03:17,041 --> 01:03:18,000
Right, Zoé?

815
01:03:32,500 --> 01:03:34,250
- Well, this is quaint.
- Shh.

816
01:03:34,333 --> 01:03:36,083
Hey! It's me!

817
01:03:36,166 --> 01:03:38,541
Oh my God!
I almost killed you!

818
01:03:38,625 --> 01:03:41,250
All day by myself!
If you're gonna be studying...

819
01:03:42,791 --> 01:03:43,750
Hello.

820
01:03:45,166 --> 01:03:48,208
Can you please put the bat down? Please?

821
01:03:50,208 --> 01:03:51,583
- Where have you been?
- I...

822
01:03:51,666 --> 01:03:53,958
These two
don't look like college students.

823
01:03:54,041 --> 01:03:56,375
Look, I…
I lost my phone and, uh…

824
01:03:56,458 --> 01:03:58,958
Blaire, Zoé, this is my grandma, Rosa.

825
01:03:59,041 --> 01:04:02,583
Grandma, this is Blaire and… and Zoé.

826
01:04:03,166 --> 01:04:04,250
- 'Sup?
- Hey.

827
01:04:04,333 --> 01:04:07,958
Okay. Good night now. Have a nice evening.

828
01:04:09,583 --> 01:04:11,458
Listen, they're waiting for a ride,

829
01:04:11,541 --> 01:04:14,250
so I was thinking maybe they could,
you know, wait here a bit.

830
01:04:14,333 --> 01:04:15,958
What happened to your hand?

831
01:04:16,041 --> 01:04:18,125
No, it's fine.
I'll get a Band-Aid...

832
01:04:18,208 --> 01:04:19,791
What Band-Aid? No Band-Aid!

833
01:04:19,875 --> 01:04:22,458
- You're gonna need stitches!
- Ma, it's okay. It's okay.

834
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:26,625
Who did this to you?

835
01:04:26,708 --> 01:04:29,041
Nothing. It was an accident.

836
01:04:30,416 --> 01:04:32,333
Yo, that was a bloodbath, G.

837
01:04:33,125 --> 01:04:36,333
We keep going like this,
it's suicide for sure.

838
01:04:42,541 --> 01:04:43,375
Damn.

839
01:04:58,291 --> 01:05:00,833
Hands on the dash.
Eyes forward.

840
01:05:02,875 --> 01:05:06,083
You. You got any weapons
or drugs in the vehicle?

841
01:05:06,666 --> 01:05:07,750
No, sir.

842
01:05:08,291 --> 01:05:09,500
Hey. Hands.

843
01:05:10,333 --> 01:05:12,375
- My ID.
- I don't need to see that.

844
01:05:12,458 --> 01:05:14,375
I know who the two of you are.

845
01:05:14,958 --> 01:05:17,666
Victor would like to meet for a drink.

846
01:05:17,750 --> 01:05:19,041
Rosso Puro.

847
01:05:20,125 --> 01:05:21,125
Thirty minutes.

848
01:05:21,208 --> 01:05:22,333
We're free to go?

849
01:05:22,416 --> 01:05:24,250
Oh yeah. I almost forgot.

850
01:05:25,125 --> 01:05:25,958
Benny says hi.

851
01:05:32,875 --> 01:05:34,791
How did this happen to you?

852
01:05:35,291 --> 01:05:37,375
Grandma, that is a long story.

853
01:05:38,541 --> 01:05:40,625
But I swear I'll tell you later.

854
01:05:40,708 --> 01:05:41,583
Okay?

855
01:05:42,333 --> 01:05:43,500
Do they speak Spanish?

856
01:05:43,583 --> 01:05:44,625
I don't know.

857
01:05:46,125 --> 01:05:48,458
Is this little Benny?

858
01:05:48,541 --> 01:05:49,916
Yo, put that back.

859
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:51,500
No. It's so good.

860
01:05:52,708 --> 01:05:53,541
You know,

861
01:05:55,125 --> 01:05:57,083
Benny's never brought a girl home before.

862
01:05:57,166 --> 01:05:59,458
- Let alone two.
<i>- Abuela,</i> seriously?

863
01:05:59,541 --> 01:06:00,791
What?

864
01:06:03,458 --> 01:06:05,125
Can I help you out with that?

865
01:06:06,291 --> 01:06:08,625
I… That's okay.

866
01:06:09,208 --> 01:06:11,041
I… I think we're fine here.

867
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:13,166
Thank you, dear.

868
01:06:29,875 --> 01:06:34,000
Yeah, all right,
you know what? I think we're good here.

869
01:06:34,083 --> 01:06:37,083
You know, I feel good.
Hand feels good. Uh…

870
01:06:37,166 --> 01:06:39,666
You… uh, you… you… you feel good?

871
01:06:39,750 --> 01:06:43,750
Do I feel good? You woke me up
in the middle of the night, Benny.

872
01:06:44,625 --> 01:06:47,833
I'm… I'm sorry, but maybe
you should get back to sleep?

873
01:06:50,458 --> 01:06:52,708
I like this one better
than the other one.

874
01:06:54,333 --> 01:06:57,291
But be careful.
I don't need great-grandchildren.

875
01:06:59,125 --> 01:07:00,750
Good evening, Rosa.

876
01:07:00,833 --> 01:07:02,125
It was a pleasure.

877
01:07:08,041 --> 01:07:10,916
- <i>What's wrong, baby?</i>
- We got jumped downtown.

878
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:13,125
Night Legion was all over us.

879
01:07:13,208 --> 01:07:15,000
<i>At least they took care of Big Lou.</i>

880
01:07:15,583 --> 01:07:17,041
How many did you kill?

881
01:07:17,125 --> 01:07:17,958
<i>Three.</i>

882
01:07:18,041 --> 01:07:21,625
<i>Maybe four. Boyle Heights was there too.</i>

883
01:07:22,750 --> 01:07:25,083
<i> I thought you said</i>
<i>you were gonna take care of Jay.</i>

884
01:07:25,791 --> 01:07:28,208
<i>Don't worry.</i>
<i>I'm on my way to meet Jay.</i>

885
01:07:28,291 --> 01:07:29,583
<i>Just stopped for a drink.</i>

886
01:07:29,666 --> 01:07:30,541
Okay.

887
01:07:31,833 --> 01:07:34,750
I don't know. I'm getting worried.

888
01:07:35,541 --> 01:07:37,750
<i>This night's going sideways.</i>

889
01:07:37,833 --> 01:07:40,083
We can't stop now. We're nearly done.

890
01:07:41,208 --> 01:07:43,916
I'm gonna drain the kid.
I'm gonna smother the grandma,

891
01:07:44,541 --> 01:07:46,166
and we can hit Venice tomorrow.

892
01:07:46,250 --> 01:07:49,708
<i>We need to clear Venice tonight.</i>
<i>Rocko is too unpredictable.</i>

893
01:07:49,791 --> 01:07:52,416
If we mess this up,
there will be no tomorrow.

894
01:07:52,500 --> 01:07:54,750
Venice is the last kill.

895
01:07:54,833 --> 01:07:56,791
I know you can do it.

896
01:07:56,875 --> 01:07:59,625
Just keep a hold of the kid,
and we'll party at dawn.

897
01:08:01,083 --> 01:08:02,541
The world will be ours, babe,

898
01:08:03,125 --> 01:08:04,375
just me and you.

899
01:08:08,041 --> 01:08:08,875
Yeah.

900
01:08:10,250 --> 01:08:11,541
Let's get it done.

901
01:08:12,041 --> 01:08:13,166
Now,

902
01:08:14,833 --> 01:08:15,916
where were we?

903
01:08:26,875 --> 01:08:28,458
It's kind of cool.

904
01:08:33,250 --> 01:08:34,250
Huh.

905
01:08:36,875 --> 01:08:37,791
All right.

906
01:08:52,333 --> 01:08:53,791
This is super cool.

907
01:08:54,291 --> 01:08:56,333
Yeah, all right.

908
01:08:56,416 --> 01:08:58,041
You… you can put that down.

909
01:08:58,958 --> 01:09:00,041
Sorry.

910
01:09:00,125 --> 01:09:02,500
This is all just leftover
from when I was a kid.

911
01:09:02,583 --> 01:09:06,333
I was gonna get rid of all of this stuff.
I haven't really had the time to upgrade...

912
01:09:06,416 --> 01:09:08,416
Yes. Did you build all of this?

913
01:09:09,500 --> 01:09:12,666
Yeah, but you know,
can we just maybe turn this down...

914
01:09:12,750 --> 01:09:14,791
Mm-mm. No.

915
01:09:16,125 --> 01:09:17,291
Why not?

916
01:09:17,375 --> 01:09:18,458
'Cause I like it.

917
01:09:19,541 --> 01:09:20,833
I think it's really good.

918
01:09:21,500 --> 01:09:26,333
I mean, I'm assuming
B's Session Number Three, that's you?

919
01:09:26,958 --> 01:09:30,250
Oh yeah. You know,
this is actually… it's a… it's a classic.

920
01:09:30,333 --> 01:09:31,458
Oh, this is a classic?

921
01:09:31,541 --> 01:09:33,375
Oh yeah, yeah. Everyone says so.

922
01:09:33,458 --> 01:09:35,041
- Oh, everyone says so?
- Mm-hmm.

923
01:09:35,125 --> 01:09:36,500
People, like who?

924
01:09:37,208 --> 01:09:40,125
You know, people like… my grandma?

925
01:09:40,208 --> 01:09:42,458
Yeah.

926
01:09:42,541 --> 01:09:45,500
So, when are you gonna play this
for other people?

927
01:09:46,291 --> 01:09:50,833
Well, I'm planning on it. I… I want
to do something… something with this.

928
01:09:50,916 --> 01:09:53,791
It's more than fun.
I wanna turn it into something real.

929
01:09:55,291 --> 01:09:56,458
And when I do, you know,

930
01:09:56,541 --> 01:09:59,875
then you could tell people
that you're my first fan.

931
01:09:59,958 --> 01:10:02,458
- So, in a way, you're welcome.
- Oh, I can?

932
01:10:02,541 --> 01:10:04,500
Yeah, you know, if you want.

933
01:10:04,583 --> 01:10:06,583
Well, I mean, for what it's worth,

934
01:10:07,333 --> 01:10:10,041
I believe you. It's really good.

935
01:10:10,541 --> 01:10:12,041
You're really talented.

936
01:10:12,541 --> 01:10:14,458
And you're a very good driver.

937
01:10:14,541 --> 01:10:16,666
- Thanks.
- Mmm.

938
01:10:18,875 --> 01:10:20,750
Well, what… what about you?

939
01:10:22,041 --> 01:10:23,125
What about me?

940
01:10:23,208 --> 01:10:26,791
You know, is there anything that you like?
Anything you're passionate about?

941
01:10:28,125 --> 01:10:31,500
I mean, like, in a past life.

942
01:10:33,458 --> 01:10:36,708
Zoé and I are always talking
about, like, the shit we're gonna do.

943
01:10:36,791 --> 01:10:39,250
- You know?
- When did you two meet?

944
01:10:39,333 --> 01:10:41,291
Um…

945
01:10:41,375 --> 01:10:44,875
She had this place
in Laurel Canyon in the '70s,

946
01:10:44,958 --> 01:10:46,708
and she would throw these parties.

947
01:10:46,791 --> 01:10:49,125
So, they would go
for like three or four days.

948
01:10:49,208 --> 01:10:51,291
Everyone was there. And she loved Bowie,

949
01:10:51,375 --> 01:10:54,083
so she had this, like…
the Bowie haircut, you know.

950
01:10:54,166 --> 01:10:56,375
She was cool, man.
The queen bitch, that was her.

951
01:10:56,458 --> 01:10:58,166
Yeah, that checks out.

952
01:10:58,250 --> 01:11:02,791
And I was, like, just like a stray
when I first moved here,

953
01:11:02,875 --> 01:11:06,500
and I didn't feel like I fit anywhere.

954
01:11:07,250 --> 01:11:08,916
And it was like she saw me.

955
01:11:10,125 --> 01:11:14,125
She told me everything could be beautiful.

956
01:11:16,500 --> 01:11:18,166
She said a bunch of stuff.

957
01:11:19,416 --> 01:11:22,333
And then she turned me,

958
01:11:23,375 --> 01:11:25,000
and she gave me this life.

959
01:11:31,333 --> 01:11:34,041
Honestly, you should take this
to a producer.

960
01:11:34,125 --> 01:11:36,125
- Yeah.
- You could make real money.

961
01:11:36,208 --> 01:11:39,333
I know, I know, it's just
I don't think it's where it has to be yet.

962
01:11:39,416 --> 01:11:41,166
Where does it have to be?
What's it missing?

963
01:11:41,250 --> 01:11:43,458
It's missing a little something
before it becomes like a...

964
01:11:43,541 --> 01:11:45,250
- Like, what? A classic?
- Yeah.

965
01:11:45,333 --> 01:11:46,750
- Mmm.
- Yeah, a classic.

966
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:55,041
We need to leave.

967
01:11:55,916 --> 01:11:57,416
Yeah. Cool.

968
01:12:01,791 --> 01:12:02,625
Hi.

969
01:12:03,750 --> 01:12:06,583
We're done with Benny, right?
He can stay here.

970
01:12:06,666 --> 01:12:07,833
I don't think so.

971
01:12:08,958 --> 01:12:12,583
- Well, this has nothing to do with him.
- He's coming. That's how it's gotta be.

972
01:12:14,083 --> 01:12:15,500
Why are you being like this?

973
01:12:17,333 --> 01:12:19,875
Do you want to be the one to tell Victor?

974
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:25,000
Hey.

975
01:12:26,208 --> 01:12:27,416
I'm coming with you.

976
01:12:28,791 --> 01:12:29,708
Good.

977
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:32,000
Let's go.

978
01:12:35,083 --> 01:12:36,875
Anything happens to me,

979
01:12:37,875 --> 01:12:39,250
you take care of Benny.

980
01:12:40,625 --> 01:12:41,958
You protect him.

981
01:12:43,083 --> 01:12:44,333
Consider it done.

982
01:13:01,041 --> 01:13:01,958
Where's Benny?

983
01:13:03,708 --> 01:13:07,416
Jay. So glad you could make it.

984
01:13:07,500 --> 01:13:09,833
You put a hand on him or Maria,
I swear to God...

985
01:13:09,916 --> 01:13:12,833
Is that her name? We'll get to her.

986
01:13:13,375 --> 01:13:14,875
But first, sit.

987
01:13:14,958 --> 01:13:16,875
- Where are they?
- Sit.

988
01:13:23,125 --> 01:13:24,916
It's funny to think, though.

989
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:26,958
Almost a hundred years ago,

990
01:13:27,833 --> 01:13:30,875
my kind sat across from your kind,

991
01:13:30,958 --> 01:13:32,916
much like you and I right now.

992
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:35,458
And then they came up with that truce.

993
01:13:36,083 --> 01:13:38,291
Well, you broke that truce.

994
01:13:38,791 --> 01:13:41,000
You took people from my neighborhood.

995
01:13:41,666 --> 01:13:42,750
Innocent people.

996
01:13:43,458 --> 01:13:45,541
Did you think we were gonna let
you get away with that?

997
01:13:45,625 --> 01:13:49,333
We? Who's this "we" you're talking about?

998
01:13:50,083 --> 01:13:53,333
Everyone's gone. I had them all killed.

999
01:13:54,291 --> 01:13:58,416
You should have taken my offer.
Now it's all going to be mine.

1000
01:13:59,500 --> 01:14:02,166
You see, you're the last piece.

1001
01:14:03,291 --> 01:14:07,458
Once you're gone,
this city's just one fat neck

1002
01:14:08,458 --> 01:14:09,958
waiting to get sucked.

1003
01:14:10,916 --> 01:14:11,875
You want me?

1004
01:14:13,500 --> 01:14:15,250
Fine. Fair game.

1005
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:18,375
Maria and Benny
have nothing to do with this.

1006
01:14:19,416 --> 01:14:20,458
Let them go.

1007
01:14:21,791 --> 01:14:25,458
That's not how this is going to go.
Nobody walks.

1008
01:14:26,750 --> 01:14:27,791
You know that.

1009
01:14:33,458 --> 01:14:37,000
How do I look? Do I look okay?

1010
01:14:40,291 --> 01:14:41,916
Do you want some?

1011
01:14:42,500 --> 01:14:43,791
I saved her for you.

1012
01:14:44,416 --> 01:14:45,708
Your sweet Maria.

1013
01:14:45,791 --> 01:14:46,625
What?

1014
01:14:47,250 --> 01:14:48,958
I saved her for you, Jay.

1015
01:14:50,125 --> 01:14:52,916
No. No.

1016
01:14:53,583 --> 01:14:55,583
Don't go soft on me now.

1017
01:14:56,291 --> 01:14:58,375
We haven't even gotten started yet.

1018
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:23,208
Last kill.

1019
01:15:25,875 --> 01:15:27,083
Let's do this.

1020
01:15:42,500 --> 01:15:44,958
Maybe lean close. This guy's a freak.

1021
01:15:49,458 --> 01:15:51,125
Look what the night dragged in.

1022
01:15:51,916 --> 01:15:53,583
Couple of strays.

1023
01:15:53,666 --> 01:15:56,125
Good morning, Rocko.

1024
01:15:57,083 --> 01:15:58,708
No such thing as a good morning.

1025
01:15:58,791 --> 01:16:00,250
Mmm, maybe not for you.

1026
01:16:04,625 --> 01:16:06,000
I don't know you, do I?

1027
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:08,708
No, but I'm… I'm with them.

1028
01:16:08,791 --> 01:16:12,000
That doesn't really change
your problem, amigo.

1029
01:16:14,916 --> 01:16:17,875
- I don't know you.
- Don't worry about him. He's cool.

1030
01:16:17,958 --> 01:16:19,291
Yeah, chill, he's with us.

1031
01:16:21,166 --> 01:16:22,125
You cool?

1032
01:16:27,250 --> 01:16:28,291
Cool, dude.

1033
01:16:29,416 --> 01:16:30,416
Rough night?

1034
01:16:32,625 --> 01:16:36,166
You look a little, uh, banged up, bro.

1035
01:16:38,166 --> 01:16:40,166
Yeah, I'm… I'm a little banged up, bro.

1036
01:16:49,625 --> 01:16:52,875
Oh, I'm just messing with you, man!
I'm goofing!

1037
01:16:52,958 --> 01:16:55,250
<i>Mi casa es su casa!</i>

1038
01:16:56,125 --> 01:16:57,708
Enter at your leisure.

1039
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:00,083
- Madam.
- Mmm.

1040
01:17:16,041 --> 01:17:18,041
Oh, you smell nice.

1041
01:17:19,041 --> 01:17:21,333
You give good blood, don't you?

1042
01:17:22,208 --> 01:17:23,250
I can tell.

1043
01:17:24,458 --> 01:17:26,458
I have a nose for these things.

1044
01:17:28,416 --> 01:17:30,000
I see things, man.

1045
01:17:31,208 --> 01:17:32,291
Visions.

1046
01:17:33,750 --> 01:17:37,958
Some people say
I'm like a… like a psychic or something.

1047
01:17:38,041 --> 01:17:40,791
- Yeah, I… I bet they do say that.
- They do.

1048
01:17:43,041 --> 01:17:44,041
Rocko.

1049
01:17:44,583 --> 01:17:45,583
Yes?

1050
01:17:46,083 --> 01:17:47,208
Not this one.

1051
01:17:49,625 --> 01:17:53,041
Oh, whatever, man.
I'm not into virgins. You know that.

1052
01:17:54,208 --> 01:17:57,166
- I'm… I'm not even a...
- Hey. Don't lie, man.

1053
01:17:58,500 --> 01:18:00,041
Third eye sees all.

1054
01:18:06,041 --> 01:18:07,333
This is weird.

1055
01:18:08,625 --> 01:18:11,833
You guys didn't call.
You showed up unannounced.

1056
01:18:13,708 --> 01:18:16,333
Is this like a booty call or something?

1057
01:18:16,416 --> 01:18:18,125
I'm not that kind of girl.

1058
01:18:18,791 --> 01:18:21,375
We just wanted
to surprise you, Rocko.

1059
01:18:22,250 --> 01:18:25,000
What, you don't like surprises anymore?

1060
01:18:26,500 --> 01:18:28,541
You know I love surprises.

1061
01:18:29,666 --> 01:18:31,375
Surprises are tight.

1062
01:18:34,750 --> 01:18:37,083
Do you want to leave us for a minute?

1063
01:18:37,958 --> 01:18:39,250
Yeah.

1064
01:18:39,333 --> 01:18:41,083
Yeah, why don't you guys, uh,

1065
01:18:41,750 --> 01:18:44,958
leave us to it for the minute
and go out to the pool?

1066
01:18:45,041 --> 01:18:48,708
Let the grown-ups, uh, conversate.

1067
01:18:54,250 --> 01:18:55,666
We'll be out there soon.

1068
01:18:58,166 --> 01:18:59,791
Bye, virgin.

1069
01:19:03,250 --> 01:19:04,083
Drink?

1070
01:19:12,041 --> 01:19:13,041
What?

1071
01:19:15,375 --> 01:19:17,958
I don't know how you could be
so chill about all this.

1072
01:19:18,041 --> 01:19:19,416
You know? It's like,

1073
01:19:20,041 --> 01:19:23,791
you're out here every night
doing this <i>Kill Bill-</i>type shit.

1074
01:19:23,875 --> 01:19:25,125
It's crazy.

1075
01:19:25,208 --> 01:19:28,041
- It's kind of… it's kind of crazy.
- It's not every night.

1076
01:19:28,625 --> 01:19:29,750
- It's not?
- No.

1077
01:19:31,458 --> 01:19:34,416
If I'm still alive tomorrow,
I am sleeping all day.

1078
01:19:36,333 --> 01:19:37,458
- Mmm.
- Sounds nice.

1079
01:19:37,541 --> 01:19:38,500
Mmm.

1080
01:19:39,666 --> 01:19:40,583
It is.

1081
01:19:46,666 --> 01:19:47,625
What's it like?

1082
01:19:48,291 --> 01:19:49,291
Hmm?

1083
01:19:50,791 --> 01:19:51,791
You know.

1084
01:19:55,625 --> 01:19:56,625
Honestly…

1085
01:19:59,750 --> 01:20:01,416
Sometimes it feels awesome.

1086
01:20:02,208 --> 01:20:03,500
You can do whatever you want.

1087
01:20:04,500 --> 01:20:06,041
You don't have to hold back.

1088
01:20:06,541 --> 01:20:08,208
You're completely free.

1089
01:20:10,916 --> 01:20:11,958
Sometimes.

1090
01:20:14,041 --> 01:20:16,208
I just killed this dude an hour ago.

1091
01:20:16,791 --> 01:20:17,916
Mm-hmm.

1092
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:19,291
Fresh type O.

1093
01:20:21,791 --> 01:20:22,833
Clean blood.

1094
01:20:26,416 --> 01:20:27,250
Can't beat it.

1095
01:20:30,833 --> 01:20:31,958
Cheers.

1096
01:20:39,625 --> 01:20:40,541
So,

1097
01:20:42,041 --> 01:20:44,375
what's with the late-night hang?

1098
01:20:45,916 --> 01:20:48,083
You girls never cross the 405.

1099
01:20:48,166 --> 01:20:50,791
We were in the neighborhood.
Figured we'd stop by.

1100
01:20:52,125 --> 01:20:53,166
Knew you'd be up late.

1101
01:21:14,250 --> 01:21:15,500
So, you got any family?

1102
01:21:17,375 --> 01:21:18,458
I got Zoé.

1103
01:21:19,416 --> 01:21:20,375
She's got me.

1104
01:21:20,875 --> 01:21:21,875
No, but like…

1105
01:21:23,708 --> 01:21:24,916
like real family.

1106
01:21:31,416 --> 01:21:32,625
You know, my, uh…

1107
01:21:35,000 --> 01:21:38,583
My grandma scooped me up
after my mom passed,

1108
01:21:38,666 --> 01:21:41,500
and it was me, and it was her,

1109
01:21:42,208 --> 01:21:43,250
and it was Jay.

1110
01:21:43,750 --> 01:21:45,083
And Jay, he… he…

1111
01:21:47,708 --> 01:21:49,041
He took care of me.

1112
01:21:50,041 --> 01:21:51,750
He… he didn't have to.

1113
01:21:52,791 --> 01:21:54,916
You know, he's… he's just my half brother,

1114
01:21:55,750 --> 01:21:59,041
but he's… he's like
the only father I've ever had.

1115
01:22:00,416 --> 01:22:01,375
I'm sorry.

1116
01:22:05,625 --> 01:22:08,541
You're not like her, you know? Like Zoé.

1117
01:22:11,708 --> 01:22:13,375
I mean, I… I see you, you're…

1118
01:22:14,708 --> 01:22:15,916
You're alive.

1119
01:22:27,916 --> 01:22:29,208
Can I ask you something?

1120
01:22:32,458 --> 01:22:33,625
Are you gonna kill me?

1121
01:22:39,625 --> 01:22:40,583
No.

1122
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:45,416
I don't want you like that.

1123
01:23:09,333 --> 01:23:11,916
So how come
you never come to visit anymore?

1124
01:23:12,791 --> 01:23:15,625
We had a good thing going back then.

1125
01:23:19,708 --> 01:23:20,875
Reagan was president.

1126
01:23:21,458 --> 01:23:23,125
Shit, it was that long ago?

1127
01:23:23,208 --> 01:23:25,125
- Mm-hmm.
- Wow.

1128
01:23:28,875 --> 01:23:30,083
Time flies.

1129
01:23:34,333 --> 01:23:35,166
What?

1130
01:23:39,250 --> 01:23:40,083
What?

1131
01:23:41,666 --> 01:23:43,041
Is something wrong?

1132
01:23:43,125 --> 01:23:46,333
No. No. Nothing wrong.

1133
01:23:48,208 --> 01:23:51,333
Oh, it just hit me.
Maybe just this one thing.

1134
01:23:52,791 --> 01:23:54,625
The part where you and Victor

1135
01:23:54,708 --> 01:23:57,333
decide to kill and steal
from your own blood.

1136
01:23:58,083 --> 01:24:00,375
You wicked bitch.

1137
01:24:00,458 --> 01:24:01,708
Oh, you bloodsucker.

1138
01:24:10,500 --> 01:24:11,333
What?

1139
01:24:12,500 --> 01:24:14,666
- I have to tell you something.
- What happened?

1140
01:24:15,333 --> 01:24:17,583
Your brother. Victor has him.

1141
01:24:24,125 --> 01:24:25,166
Benny, get the car.

1142
01:24:51,666 --> 01:24:52,583
Tango down!

1143
01:25:37,458 --> 01:25:38,625
Drive! Drive!

1144
01:25:57,125 --> 01:25:59,208
Babe, you're okay. We did it.

1145
01:25:59,291 --> 01:26:01,625
I'm sorry.

1146
01:26:02,916 --> 01:26:04,166
The night's over.

1147
01:26:05,166 --> 01:26:07,166
We'll go home, and you'll be okay.

1148
01:26:08,166 --> 01:26:09,500
Benny, she needs blood.

1149
01:26:13,125 --> 01:26:14,041
Oh God.

1150
01:26:14,625 --> 01:26:16,500
We have to get to the last stop.

1151
01:26:17,333 --> 01:26:19,333
Okay. Okay.

1152
01:26:46,916 --> 01:26:50,125
- Okay, let's get her inside.
- No. Hey, you take the car and run.

1153
01:26:50,208 --> 01:26:52,375
- Okay?
- What are you talking about?

1154
01:26:52,458 --> 01:26:53,833
This is Victor's house.

1155
01:26:55,291 --> 01:26:57,708
Okay, and he has Jay,
so I'm not going anywhere.

1156
01:26:57,791 --> 01:27:00,958
I'm sorry. Okay?
I'm sorry, I am. But it's too late.

1157
01:27:01,041 --> 01:27:05,166
No, it's not too late. If there's a chance
that he's in there, then I'm going in!

1158
01:27:05,250 --> 01:27:08,250
You're dead the second you go in there.
Don't you understand?

1159
01:27:09,000 --> 01:27:10,458
Not if you help me.

1160
01:27:13,916 --> 01:27:14,750
It's over.

1161
01:27:16,083 --> 01:27:17,208
Promise me.

1162
01:27:18,291 --> 01:27:21,125
Okay. Come on. Come on, come on, come on.

1163
01:27:21,208 --> 01:27:23,833
You're good.
All right. Ready? Ready?

1164
01:27:24,666 --> 01:27:25,750
Okay. Come on.

1165
01:28:56,666 --> 01:28:57,541
Jay.

1166
01:28:59,750 --> 01:29:00,791
Jay.

1167
01:29:01,833 --> 01:29:02,708
Jay.

1168
01:29:02,791 --> 01:29:03,708
Hey, Jay.

1169
01:29:03,791 --> 01:29:07,250
Hey. Hey, yo, Jay.
Hey, it's me. It's Benny, hey.

1170
01:29:10,125 --> 01:29:12,208
You see me? Hey.

1171
01:29:12,833 --> 01:29:14,708
I'mma get you out.

1172
01:29:14,791 --> 01:29:16,291
I'mma… I'mma…

1173
01:29:18,291 --> 01:29:20,708
I'mma get you out of here.
I'mma get you out.

1174
01:29:30,083 --> 01:29:32,500
Look who's decided to join us.

1175
01:29:32,583 --> 01:29:33,958
Benny.

1176
01:29:34,041 --> 01:29:38,083
Did you miss us? You missed us.

1177
01:29:38,166 --> 01:29:39,750
I'm sensing some tension here.

1178
01:29:40,708 --> 01:29:42,958
Yeah, Benny's had a busy night.

1179
01:29:43,041 --> 01:29:47,041
I've heard so much about you.
Why don't you join us? Take a seat.

1180
01:29:47,125 --> 01:29:49,291
- I'd rather stand.
- Oh.

1181
01:29:49,375 --> 01:29:52,333
So, tell us, Benny.
What are you doing here?

1182
01:29:52,416 --> 01:29:53,875
I'd like to make a deal.

1183
01:29:54,541 --> 01:29:57,625
Let Jay go. Take me instead.

1184
01:29:59,416 --> 01:30:01,041
It's an interesting proposal.

1185
01:30:01,125 --> 01:30:03,083
Benny.

1186
01:30:03,791 --> 01:30:04,625
Hey, Blaire.

1187
01:30:05,750 --> 01:30:06,875
What's wrong?

1188
01:30:06,958 --> 01:30:08,291
I didn't say anything.

1189
01:30:08,375 --> 01:30:10,583
Benny, have you ever tried fresh blood?

1190
01:30:11,541 --> 01:30:13,458
There's nothing like it.

1191
01:30:16,208 --> 01:30:18,125
I remember when I first came here.

1192
01:30:19,500 --> 01:30:20,958
The blood tastes different.

1193
01:30:22,541 --> 01:30:24,291
I had to get used to it.

1194
01:30:25,958 --> 01:30:27,750
I had to develop my palate.

1195
01:30:29,250 --> 01:30:30,500
Now I can't get enough.

1196
01:30:35,958 --> 01:30:38,833
After considering your proposal,
unfortunately,

1197
01:30:38,916 --> 01:30:40,416
I'm going to have to decline.

1198
01:30:41,708 --> 01:30:43,625
But here's my counteroffer.

1199
01:30:44,166 --> 01:30:46,750
Because I run things now,

1200
01:30:46,833 --> 01:30:48,541
you will be our appetizer.

1201
01:30:50,333 --> 01:30:55,083
Jay will be our main course.
And I think I'll save <i>abuela</i> for dessert.

1202
01:30:57,083 --> 01:31:00,625
Hey! Don't you fucking touch him!
What are you doing? He saved us tonight.

1203
01:31:00,708 --> 01:31:02,750
Well, then I guess
we'll make it quick, then.

1204
01:31:02,833 --> 01:31:05,375
Hold him down. It's time to drink.

1205
01:31:07,500 --> 01:31:09,750
- Don't.
- Oh. This is interesting.

1206
01:31:09,833 --> 01:31:11,000
She's just confused.

1207
01:31:11,083 --> 01:31:13,500
- You're not confused, are you?
- Not at all, actually.

1208
01:31:13,583 --> 01:31:14,583
Hey.

1209
01:31:15,208 --> 01:31:16,916
Everything's okay. What's going on?

1210
01:31:17,000 --> 01:31:18,708
- We won! We won!
- We won?

1211
01:31:18,791 --> 01:31:20,416
Blaire, stop. You don't gotta do this.

1212
01:31:20,500 --> 01:31:23,666
- I'll tell you when you can talk!
- I don't work for you anymore.

1213
01:31:24,250 --> 01:31:26,500
So I'm not gonna listen
to any more of your crazy bullshit.

1214
01:31:26,583 --> 01:31:29,250
You're gonna let him
talk to us like that, Blaire?

1215
01:31:30,500 --> 01:31:31,375
I can't do this.

1216
01:31:31,458 --> 01:31:35,416
No, no, no, no!
Everything is finally good.

1217
01:31:35,500 --> 01:31:38,916
- We're finally good.
- I'm telling you, I'm done.

1218
01:31:39,000 --> 01:31:40,791
Hey! I need you.

1219
01:31:41,375 --> 01:31:46,166
I can't do this without you.
I don't want to do this without you.

1220
01:31:46,250 --> 01:31:48,500
- I want out. Oh!
- No, Blaire, no!

1221
01:31:48,583 --> 01:31:50,125
You were nothing!

1222
01:31:50,208 --> 01:31:53,041
I made you! I made you!

1223
01:31:53,125 --> 01:31:54,791
You can't leave me.

1224
01:31:55,291 --> 01:31:57,000
- You need me.
- Not anymore.

1225
01:31:58,083 --> 01:31:59,208
- No!
- No!

1226
01:32:05,250 --> 01:32:07,375
- Look at what you did, Benny.
- No!

1227
01:32:07,458 --> 01:32:09,000
Look at what you did.

1228
01:32:13,000 --> 01:32:15,333
She's had a weak heart.
Put her out of her misery.

1229
01:32:15,416 --> 01:32:17,375
This was supposed to be our night.

1230
01:32:18,125 --> 01:32:19,125
No.

1231
01:32:20,875 --> 01:32:21,958
Night's over.

1232
01:33:34,666 --> 01:33:35,500
Benny.

1233
01:33:37,125 --> 01:33:38,250
Jay?

1234
01:33:38,333 --> 01:33:39,916
- Hey. Jay.
- Run.

1235
01:33:40,458 --> 01:33:43,208
- Jay. Where is he? Where is he?
- Run. Run. Now.

1236
01:33:43,291 --> 01:33:45,708
It's a trap. Benny...

1237
01:34:52,041 --> 01:34:54,916
Benny, you're okay. No, Benny. Benny.

1238
01:34:55,541 --> 01:34:59,291
Hey. No. You're okay. You're okay.

1239
01:35:04,416 --> 01:35:05,583
It's okay.

1240
01:35:19,250 --> 01:35:20,125
Here.

1241
01:37:17,708 --> 01:37:20,458
- I, uh, spoke to the depot.
- Right.

1242
01:37:20,541 --> 01:37:22,958
"Jay, you can never ever drive
for the company again."

1243
01:37:23,458 --> 01:37:26,791
- I told you not to scratch it, fool.
- I did a little more than a scratch it.

1244
01:37:26,875 --> 01:37:29,458
Yeah, you did, man. Yeah, you did.

1245
01:37:29,541 --> 01:37:31,291
But, um, I wouldn't be here

1246
01:37:31,375 --> 01:37:34,041
eating this fine slice of pizza
if it weren't for you.

1247
01:37:35,333 --> 01:37:37,041
Well, you'd do the same for me so…

1248
01:37:41,083 --> 01:37:43,083
Things are gonna be different, you know.

1249
01:37:43,583 --> 01:37:45,208
The whole world's changed.

1250
01:37:46,083 --> 01:37:48,166
And everyone's gonna have to take a side.

1251
01:37:51,625 --> 01:37:54,666
Just don't forget where you came from.

1252
01:37:56,125 --> 01:37:57,458
I know where home is.

1253
01:38:06,083 --> 01:38:09,208
Oh, I, uh, left you a little something.

1254
01:39:04,291 --> 01:39:06,750
Come on. Ask him what happened.

1255
01:39:06,833 --> 01:39:07,666
Yo.

1256
01:39:08,291 --> 01:39:09,333
Benny, man. Hold up.

1257
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:12,833
What's up?

1258
01:39:12,916 --> 01:39:14,500
Where you been, man?

1259
01:39:15,166 --> 01:39:17,250
We see you at the club,
and then you went MIA.

1260
01:39:17,333 --> 01:39:18,958
Yeah. Um, Benny.

1261
01:39:22,625 --> 01:39:23,458
Are you okay?

1262
01:39:28,083 --> 01:39:29,208
Never been better.

1263
01:39:31,000 --> 01:39:32,000
Hey.

1264
01:39:32,875 --> 01:39:35,083
Get in. We're running late.

1265
01:39:40,708 --> 01:39:42,958
Yeah, I gotta go,
but I'll see y'all later, yeah?

1266
01:39:43,916 --> 01:39:44,958
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1267
01:39:56,625 --> 01:39:57,625
Y'all want a ride?
