00:02:19,967 --> 00:02:22,521
Hey, come on, I thought
we were gonna get high.

2
00:02:28,044 --> 00:02:29,839
Yeah, we can get high later.

3
00:02:43,024 --> 00:02:44,474
Jessica...

4
00:02:46,614 --> 00:02:48,306
Jessica, what...

5
00:02:50,687 --> 00:02:52,275
It's not funny.

6
00:02:55,347 --> 00:02:56,659
Jesus Christ, Jessica,

7
00:02:56,762 --> 00:03:00,214
what fucking size
shoe do you have?

8
00:03:00,318 --> 00:03:01,871
Hey, come on.

9
00:03:14,504 --> 00:03:16,299
Jess?

10
00:03:22,098 --> 00:03:24,514
Oh, no, did you
get high already?

11
00:03:27,034 --> 00:03:28,034
Run...

12
00:03:48,918 --> 00:03:50,022

-You do realize

32
00:05:01,542 --> 00:05:03,544
that the '80s are
as far away from me

33
00:05:03,648 --> 00:05:05,132
as the '40s were to you, right?

34
00:05:05,235 --> 00:05:06,651
What? That is not true.

35
00:05:06,754 --> 00:05:07,962
Do the math.

36
00:05:09,723 --> 00:05:11,000
Shit.

37
00:05:11,103 --> 00:05:14,106
Oh, well, uh, we're here.

00:05:27,361 --> 00:05:29,846
It's big.

41
00:05:34,541 --> 00:05:37,992
The town's previous
doctor used to live here

42
00:05:38,096 --> 00:05:39,200
before he moved away.

43
00:05:39,304 --> 00:05:40,498
You sure he didn't die in here?

44
00:05:40,581 --> 00:05:41,686
Yeah, it doesn't...

45
00:05:41,789 --> 00:05:42,928

a window, it'll be fine.

00:05:59,945 --> 00:06:01,533

a very long, they...

Are you good?

72
00:08:00,549 --> 00:08:01,550
Hmm?

73
00:08:01,653 --> 00:08:03,517
Yeah. I'm-I'm great.

74
00:08:03,621 --> 00:08:05,381
How are you?

75
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:06,865
Oh, uh, yeah.

76
00:08:07,797 --> 00:08:08,902
Good.

77
00:08:09,972 --> 00:08:11,525
Good.

78
00:08:11,629 --> 00:08:12,422
We're gonna be okay.

79
00:08:12,526 --> 00:08:14,632
Are you sure?

80
00:08:14,735 --> 00:08:16,910
Yeah, are you kidding
me? Look at this place.

81
00:08:17,013 --> 00:08:19,188
It looks like a home
makeover dream come true.

82
00:08:19,291 --> 00:08:21,348
Hey, it's your first day,
let me drive you to school.

83
00:08:21,431 --> 00:08:23,606
Dad, I am 17 years old.

84
00:08:23,710 --> 00:08:25,919
I don't need a
ride, I need a car.

85
00:08:26,022 --> 00:08:27,320
I hear you, absolutely,
but in the meantime...

86
00:08:27,403 --> 00:08:28,231
I'm just going to walk.

87
00:08:28,335 --> 00:08:29,578
Okay.

88
00:08:29,681 --> 00:08:31,407
Uh, sorry about breakfast.

89
00:08:31,511 --> 00:08:33,892
I'll, um, I'll get
groceries after work.

90
00:08:33,996 --> 00:08:36,585
Okay, do you think Wi-Fi
might be more important?

91
00:08:36,688 --> 00:08:37,724
Yes, I hear you.

92
00:08:37,827 --> 00:08:38,656
I will get on that.

93
00:08:38,759 --> 00:08:40,209
Have a great day at school.

94
00:08:40,312 --> 00:08:42,142
Make new friends.
-Not a chance.

95
00:08:47,975 --> 00:08:49,667
Oh, hi.

96
00:08:49,770 --> 00:08:52,221
Sorry, didn't mean to scare ya.

97
00:08:52,324 --> 00:08:53,898
I saw you were new to the
neighborhood, and I...

98
00:08:53,981 --> 00:08:55,638
Ow! Uh, sorry.

99
00:08:55,742 --> 00:08:57,022
Hey, uh, is
everything all right?

100
00:08:57,122 --> 00:08:58,296
Oh, yeah.

101
00:08:58,399 --> 00:08:59,297
Sorry, it's just a neighbor.

102
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:00,712
Ruston Vance,

103
00:09:00,816 --> 00:09:03,197
but everyone around here
just calls me "Rust."

104
00:09:03,301 --> 00:09:04,198
Oh, I'm Dr. Maybrook.

105
00:09:04,302 --> 00:09:05,130
This is my daughter, Quinn.

106
00:09:05,234 --> 00:09:07,754
Uh, she's about to
head off to school.

107
00:09:07,857 --> 00:09:08,893
Do you want to walk her?

108
00:09:08,996 --> 00:09:11,620
That's exactly
why I'm here, sir.

109
00:09:15,416 --> 00:09:17,280
Okay, cool. Let's do it.

110
00:09:29,223 --> 00:09:32,502
So, what do you guys
do around here for fun?

111
00:09:32,606 --> 00:09:34,608
Oh, um,

112
00:09:34,712 --> 00:09:36,748
I might not be the
best person to ask.

113
00:09:36,852 --> 00:09:39,544
I mean, the hunting
and fishing's good,

114
00:09:39,648 --> 00:09:41,339
if you like that sort of thing.

115
00:09:41,442 --> 00:09:42,927
Ducks are in season.

116
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:45,100
Shit.

117
00:09:45,999 --> 00:09:46,793
What?

118
00:09:46,896 --> 00:09:48,070
The look on your face.

119
00:09:48,173 --> 00:09:49,174
I...

120
00:09:49,278 --> 00:09:50,437
I guess I'm not doing
any good for stereotypes.

121
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:52,281
Oh, no.

122
00:09:52,384 --> 00:09:53,627
Not everyone's a redneck here.

123
00:09:53,731 --> 00:09:56,526
I just don't really care
what other people think...

124
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:02,981
Unlike some people.

125
00:10:03,085 --> 00:10:05,018
So I guess I'll see you around.

126
00:10:05,121 --> 00:10:06,281
It was nice meeting you, Quinn.

127
00:10:06,364 --> 00:10:07,365
Yeah, thanks, dude.

128
00:10:07,468 --> 00:10:08,849
Oh, and, uh,

129
00:10:08,953 --> 00:10:10,748
be careful who
you hang out with.

130
00:10:10,851 --> 00:10:12,922
There's some real
weirdos at this school.

131
00:10:14,096 --> 00:10:15,649
Okey-dokey, Rust.

132
00:10:15,753 --> 00:10:16,754
Thank you.

133
00:10:16,857 --> 00:10:20,171
I will keep an eye out for 'em.

134
00:10:20,274 --> 00:10:22,380
Just because it's
Founder's Day tomorrow

135
00:10:22,483 --> 00:10:25,107
doesn't mean that there
won't be a test on Monday.

136
00:10:26,522 --> 00:10:27,419
Listen, you kids
are spoiled rotten.

137
00:10:27,523 --> 00:10:28,545
Back when I was in school,

138
00:10:28,628 --> 00:10:30,112
we had it a lot
tougher than you do.

139
00:10:30,215 --> 00:10:31,561
Hi.

140
00:10:31,665 --> 00:10:33,218
Sorry, I'm...

141
00:10:33,322 --> 00:10:34,357
Late.

142
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:37,947
Take a seat.

143
00:10:38,051 --> 00:10:39,051
Okay.

144
00:10:44,402 --> 00:10:45,506
As I was saying,

145
00:10:45,610 --> 00:10:47,439
you kids are graduating
this year, and...

146
00:10:47,543 --> 00:10:48,440
I'm graduating?

147
00:10:48,544 --> 00:10:50,753
Sick, man.

148
00:10:50,857 --> 00:10:52,375
Assuming you manage
to land a job,

149
00:10:52,479 --> 00:10:56,000
which for some of you,
might be a long shot,

150
00:10:56,103 --> 00:10:59,003
what do you think happens on
Monday morning every week?

151
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:02,040
You go to work,

152
00:11:02,144 --> 00:11:04,974
and work is neither
easy nor fun.

153
00:11:05,078 --> 00:11:07,874
In fact, sometimes it can
be downright miserable.

154
00:11:15,295 --> 00:11:16,676
Okay, this is not funny.

155
00:11:16,779 --> 00:11:19,092
Who did this?

156
00:11:19,195 --> 00:11:20,300
Nobody.

157
00:11:20,403 --> 00:11:21,611
All right.

158
00:11:21,715 --> 00:11:23,130
Well, clear your desks.

159
00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:26,133
We'll do the test now.

160
00:11:26,237 --> 00:11:28,170
Brought this on yourselves.

161
00:11:28,273 --> 00:11:30,227
It's time your generation
learned some consequences.

162
00:11:30,310 --> 00:11:32,726
Uh, Mr. Vern, that's not
fair to the new girl.

163
00:11:32,830 --> 00:11:34,417
Well, that's the
price of being late.

164
00:11:34,521 --> 00:11:36,799
Oh, they put the wrong room
number on my schedule, so...

165
00:11:36,903 --> 00:11:38,183
You know what?
Detention for you.

166
00:11:38,283 --> 00:11:39,181
What?

167
00:11:39,284 --> 00:11:40,872
Anyone else?

168
00:11:40,976 --> 00:11:42,653
Come on, chill, she didn't
actually do anything.

169
00:11:42,736 --> 00:11:43,792
Oh, well, then you
can console her

170
00:11:43,875 --> 00:11:44,738
this afternoon, Mr. Hill.

171
00:11:44,842 --> 00:11:45,739
In detention.

172
00:11:45,843 --> 00:11:47,258
-Really?
-Mm.

173
00:11:47,361 --> 00:11:48,777
Wow, you're on fire
today, Mr. Vern.

174
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:52,021
Try me. Anyone else?

175
00:11:58,476 --> 00:12:01,721
What is so funny?

176
00:12:01,824 --> 00:12:03,653
This isn't the test, Mr. Vern.

177
00:12:03,757 --> 00:12:05,000
Of course it's the test.

178
00:12:05,103 --> 00:12:07,934
Actually, I think it's
your dating profile.

179
00:12:12,110 --> 00:12:14,768
If one of these
leaves this room,

180
00:12:14,872 --> 00:12:16,183
you will all be suspended.

181
00:12:16,287 --> 00:12:17,150
I will end you!

182
00:12:17,253 --> 00:12:20,774
Okay, he is actually
losing his mind.

183
00:12:20,878 --> 00:12:22,362
...participation
trophy generation...

184
00:12:22,465 --> 00:12:24,744
Already 3,000 views.

185
00:12:24,847 --> 00:12:26,815
Wow, his meltdown is a hit.

186
00:12:26,918 --> 00:12:30,991
Man, I'm still trying to
figure out what I did.

187
00:12:31,095 --> 00:12:32,786
Ugh, he's just a bitter old man.

188
00:12:32,890 --> 00:12:33,856
He hates us,

189
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:35,755
and so we hate him
back, only more.

190
00:12:35,858 --> 00:12:36,721
It's fun.

191
00:12:36,825 --> 00:12:37,895
I'm Janet, by the way,

192
00:12:37,998 --> 00:12:40,449
and that's Ronnie,
Tucker, Matt, and...

193
00:12:40,552 --> 00:12:41,484
I'm Cole.

194
00:12:41,588 --> 00:12:43,901
I'm Quinn.

195
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:46,248
Where are you from?

196
00:12:46,351 --> 00:12:47,939
Philly, actually.

197
00:12:48,043 --> 00:12:49,320
-Philly.
-Yeah.

198
00:12:49,423 --> 00:12:51,771
My dad got put in Witness
Protection Program,

199
00:12:51,874 --> 00:12:53,911
so we're just laying
low for a little while.

200
00:12:55,257 --> 00:12:57,466
I'm kidding, obviously.

201
00:12:57,569 --> 00:12:59,744
So, is Kettle Springs

202
00:12:59,848 --> 00:13:00,938
everything you
expected it to be?

203
00:13:01,021 --> 00:13:03,472
Man, it looks like
it's stuck in the '90s.

204
00:13:03,575 --> 00:13:06,095
It still is the '90s
for everyone over 30.

205
00:13:06,199 --> 00:13:08,152
Yeah, they're really big
on tradition around here.

206
00:13:08,235 --> 00:13:09,581
Yeah, Founder's Day, right?

207
00:13:09,685 --> 00:13:10,845
I keep seeing
that, what is that?

208
00:13:10,928 --> 00:13:13,862
That is a stupid holiday
my family invented

209
00:13:13,965 --> 00:13:16,174
to celebrate corn.

210
00:13:16,278 --> 00:13:19,108
His dad is the local oligarch.

211
00:13:19,212 --> 00:13:22,422
My great-grandfather
invented Baypen corn syrup,

212
00:13:22,525 --> 00:13:23,803
like, a hundred years ago.

213
00:13:23,906 --> 00:13:24,838
Whoa.

214
00:13:24,942 --> 00:13:26,253
Every year, there's this parade

215
00:13:26,357 --> 00:13:28,462
where everyone gathers
around a Frendo float

216
00:13:28,566 --> 00:13:29,256
and worships him.

217
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:31,086
Frendo?

218
00:13:31,189 --> 00:13:34,054
He's the clown on all
the Baypen labels.

219
00:13:34,158 --> 00:13:35,248
He's practically a local legend.

220
00:13:35,331 --> 00:13:36,746
Which is why we turned him

221
00:13:36,850 --> 00:13:38,058
into a serial killer...

222
00:13:38,162 --> 00:13:39,749
On our YouTube channel.

223
00:13:39,853 --> 00:13:41,579
65,000 subscribers.

224
00:13:41,682 --> 00:13:43,236
No shit?

225
00:13:43,339 --> 00:13:44,754
Do you wanna see
some of our work?

226
00:13:44,858 --> 00:13:46,170
Hell, yeah.

227
00:13:47,861 --> 00:13:50,036
I work the night shift

228
00:13:50,139 --> 00:13:51,727
here at the Baypen factory.

229
00:13:53,039 --> 00:13:54,143
The power just went out,

230
00:13:54,247 --> 00:13:56,801
and I swear I just
heard someone laughing.

231
00:13:56,905 --> 00:13:58,251
There shouldn't be anyone here.

232
00:14:00,770 --> 00:14:03,049
Okay, hang on.

233
00:14:07,467 --> 00:14:08,917
Did you just hear that?

234
00:14:09,020 --> 00:14:10,660
No, no, no, I gotta
get the power back on.

235
00:14:16,648 --> 00:14:17,857
Okay.

236
00:14:19,651 --> 00:14:20,651
Aah, shit, it's Frendo!

237
00:14:31,146 --> 00:14:32,664
God, look at these prices.

238
00:14:32,768 --> 00:14:34,666
It's $10 for a Salisbury steak

239
00:14:34,770 --> 00:14:37,221
and a free side.

240
00:14:40,086 --> 00:14:41,646
Think you can get off
your phone, Quinn?

241
00:14:41,742 --> 00:14:44,711
Hmm? Yeah.

242
00:14:44,814 --> 00:14:46,782
You missing your friends?

243
00:14:46,886 --> 00:14:48,715
Mm-hmm.

244
00:14:48,818 --> 00:14:50,178
That why you were
acting out today?

245
00:14:52,063 --> 00:14:53,375
School called.

246
00:14:53,478 --> 00:14:56,378
Detention on your first
day is not really like you.

247
00:14:56,481 --> 00:14:58,690
Dad, the teacher
was a total dick.

248
00:14:58,794 --> 00:15:00,140
Okay.

249
00:15:00,244 --> 00:15:02,073
You all ready to order?

250
00:15:02,177 --> 00:15:03,385
Yeah, no, actually, um,

251
00:15:03,488 --> 00:15:04,751
I would love just one more
second with this menu.

252
00:15:04,834 --> 00:15:05,939
It's my first time here.

253
00:15:06,043 --> 00:15:07,837
Aw, take all the
time you need, Doc.

254
00:15:07,941 --> 00:15:08,942
Thank you.

255
00:15:12,739 --> 00:15:15,776
Can you please try and be a
little bit more respectful?

256
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:16,902
This is like the
only place in town.

257
00:15:16,985 --> 00:15:18,331
What?

258
00:15:18,434 --> 00:15:20,609
Tell me there's at least
a grocery store, right?

259
00:15:20,712 --> 00:15:21,768
Mm-hmm, yeah, yeah, I just,

260
00:15:21,851 --> 00:15:22,908
I didn't get a chance to go yet

261
00:15:22,991 --> 00:15:25,062
because the cable guy was late.

262
00:15:26,373 --> 00:15:28,789
Does that mean we have Wi-Fi?

263
00:15:28,893 --> 00:15:30,377
You're welcome.

264
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:32,862
Oh, ho, ho, ho,

265
00:15:32,966 --> 00:15:33,829
who is this person?

266
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:35,486
Have you seen my daughter?

267
00:15:35,589 --> 00:15:37,384
She's like... she's
like about your height.

268
00:15:37,488 --> 00:15:39,386
I think she's a little
taller than that.

269
00:15:39,490 --> 00:15:40,456
Hi, George. Usual?

270
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:41,961
Hey, would you mind
putting some extra cheese

271
00:15:42,044 --> 00:15:43,735
on that potato tonight, Trudy?

272
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:45,323
Oh, you got it, darlin'.

273
00:15:45,427 --> 00:15:47,118
Thank you, doll.

274
00:15:47,222 --> 00:15:48,016
Hey!

275
00:15:48,119 --> 00:15:49,879
You must be the new doc.

276
00:15:49,983 --> 00:15:50,846
Dr. Maybrook.

277
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:51,709
Yes, sir. Call me Glenn.

278
00:15:51,812 --> 00:15:53,366
Hey, Sheriff Dunne.

279
00:15:53,469 --> 00:15:56,300
Hi. This is my daughter, Quinn.

280
00:15:56,403 --> 00:15:57,563
Nice to meet you, sweetheart.

281
00:15:59,027 --> 00:16:00,428
I saw that new sign
on your practice.

282
00:16:00,511 --> 00:16:02,547
When are you all fittin'
to take new patients?

283
00:16:02,651 --> 00:16:04,860
Oh, uh, yeah, I'm gonna
start tomorrow morning.

284
00:16:04,964 --> 00:16:06,344
Oh, okay.

285
00:16:06,448 --> 00:16:07,828
Well, I might be first in line.

286
00:16:07,932 --> 00:16:10,003
Got a plantar's wart
the size of Texas.

287
00:16:11,556 --> 00:16:12,972
I tell you what,

288
00:16:13,075 --> 00:16:14,131
folks around here
have been hurting

289
00:16:14,214 --> 00:16:15,236
ever since that
factory burned down.

290
00:16:15,319 --> 00:16:16,768
It's been a real mess, yeah.

291
00:16:19,737 --> 00:16:20,737
Sheriff...

292
00:16:28,884 --> 00:16:31,266
Sorry about that, Doc.

293
00:16:31,369 --> 00:16:34,200
Been having some problems with
our local teenagers lately.

294
00:16:34,303 --> 00:16:36,084
I recommend you stay away
from that crowd, sweetheart.

295
00:16:36,167 --> 00:16:37,134
Yeah.

296
00:16:37,237 --> 00:16:39,791
Thank you, that's
some good advice.

297
00:16:41,069 --> 00:16:43,071
Uh, do you want to
join us, Sheriff?

298
00:16:43,174 --> 00:16:45,349
Oh, that's mighty kind of
you. Don't mind if I do.

299
00:16:45,452 --> 00:16:46,281
All right.

300
00:16:46,384 --> 00:16:47,385
What are you doing?

301
00:16:47,489 --> 00:16:48,490
Come on, okay?

302
00:16:48,593 --> 00:16:52,080
Um, I actually just realized
I'm not that hungry.

303
00:16:52,183 --> 00:16:53,771
You don't have to...

304
00:16:53,874 --> 00:16:54,772
You sure about that?

305
00:16:54,875 --> 00:16:55,980
I tell you what,

306
00:16:56,084 --> 00:16:57,016
Kettle Burger's the
best you'll ever have.

307
00:16:57,119 --> 00:16:57,982
I guarantee it.

308
00:16:58,086 --> 00:16:59,397
I bet.

309
00:16:59,501 --> 00:17:02,262
I don't really eat anything
with a face right now, though.

310
00:17:02,366 --> 00:17:03,491
Yeah, she's...
she's a vegetarian.

311
00:17:03,574 --> 00:17:04,471
Oh, yeah.

312
00:17:04,575 --> 00:17:05,734
Well, her generation's
gotta save the world

313
00:17:05,817 --> 00:17:06,956
one cow at a time, right?

314
00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:07,957
Okay,

315
00:17:08,061 --> 00:17:09,511
you guys have a
really good time.

316
00:17:09,614 --> 00:17:10,512
I'm gonna...

317
00:17:10,615 --> 00:17:11,685
Okay, but Quinn...

318
00:17:11,789 --> 00:17:12,652
I'll see you at home, Dad.

319
00:17:12,755 --> 00:17:13,584
You don't have to...

320
00:17:13,687 --> 00:17:15,931
Hey, gotta let 'em
go someday, Doc.

321
00:17:24,664 --> 00:17:25,664
Oh, look who's coming.

322
00:17:28,012 --> 00:17:29,910
That was quick.

323
00:17:30,014 --> 00:17:31,878
Yeah, I was about to
assault an officer.

324
00:17:31,981 --> 00:17:33,569
Oh, Minnie Mouse is so tough.

325
00:17:33,673 --> 00:17:35,226
I bet Sheriff Dunne
was trembling.

326
00:17:35,330 --> 00:17:36,800
I mean, you should try
and avoid Sheriff Dunne.

327
00:17:36,883 --> 00:17:39,196
That guy's got it out for us.

328
00:17:39,299 --> 00:17:43,096
Hey, you don't have a
fake ID, do you, New Girl?

329
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:44,373
Oh, yeah, actually, I do.

330
00:17:44,477 --> 00:17:46,548
Uh, it's just in some
boxes back at my house.

331
00:17:46,651 --> 00:17:47,411
Bullshit.

332
00:17:47,514 --> 00:17:49,861
Guys, we don't need fake IDs.

333
00:17:49,965 --> 00:17:51,139
I got my guns.

334
00:17:51,242 --> 00:17:53,313
These guns.

335
00:17:53,417 --> 00:17:55,764
Oh, my God, you
are such a loser.

336
00:17:55,867 --> 00:17:56,489
I'm pretty sure your guns

337
00:17:56,592 --> 00:17:57,766
aren't going to get us drunk.

338
00:17:57,869 --> 00:17:59,250
Speak for yourself.

339
00:17:59,354 --> 00:18:01,045
My god, guys, chill.

340
00:18:01,149 --> 00:18:02,805
Matty and I got this.

341
00:18:02,909 --> 00:18:04,000
Watch and learn, boys and girls.

342
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:06,257
Watch and learn.

343
00:18:09,018 --> 00:18:11,400
That's no way to treat money!

344
00:18:24,172 --> 00:18:25,794
-Where are you from?
-Hmm?

345
00:18:25,897 --> 00:18:28,452
Oh, I'm from the East Coast.

346
00:18:28,555 --> 00:18:29,763
East Coast?

347
00:18:29,867 --> 00:18:31,696
Damn, that's very far.

348
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:33,201
My grandmother?
Really? My grandmother?

349
00:18:33,284 --> 00:18:34,872
How could you?

350
00:18:34,975 --> 00:18:36,736
Look, sorry, I've got
a thing for old ladies.

351
00:18:36,839 --> 00:18:37,495
Oh, really?

352
00:18:37,599 --> 00:18:38,669
Can't blame a brother.

353
00:18:40,049 --> 00:18:41,085
Hey, hey, stop that!

354
00:18:41,189 --> 00:18:42,279
Dude plowed my grandma Gladys.

355
00:18:42,362 --> 00:18:44,433
It's not like that, Matty.

356
00:18:44,537 --> 00:18:47,229
It was magical. I'm in love.

357
00:18:47,333 --> 00:18:48,699
-Oh yeah?
-Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

358
00:18:48,782 --> 00:18:49,542
You gotta take this

359
00:18:49,645 --> 00:18:51,116
and your grandma-loving
asses outside!

360
00:18:51,199 --> 00:18:53,339
And... it's a miracle,

361
00:18:53,442 --> 00:18:54,478
but she's pregnant.

362
00:18:54,581 --> 00:18:55,617
What?

363
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:56,687
And I'm going to marry her.

364
00:18:56,790 --> 00:18:58,054
You think you can
fuck my grandma?!

365
00:18:58,137 --> 00:18:59,657
I'm going to be your
granddaddy, buddy!

366
00:19:03,142 --> 00:19:04,902
No!

367
00:19:05,005 --> 00:19:06,041
Come on, man, let's go!

368
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:07,318
Come on!

369
00:19:10,770 --> 00:19:11,840
To Otis!

370
00:19:11,943 --> 00:19:13,600
The best damn store clerk

371
00:19:13,704 --> 00:19:15,119
Kettle Springs could
ever ask for...

372
00:19:15,223 --> 00:19:18,364
and to Matt's sexy
grandmother Gladys.

373
00:19:18,467 --> 00:19:19,572
Yes!

374
00:19:19,675 --> 00:19:21,677
-To Grandma Gladys!
-To Grandma Gladys!

375
00:19:24,611 --> 00:19:25,854
-Oh, my god.
-Oh, man. Ew!

376
00:19:25,957 --> 00:19:27,235
Ronnie,

377
00:19:27,338 --> 00:19:28,132
you couldn't have stole
anything better than this?

378
00:19:28,236 --> 00:19:29,098
It was the first
thing I grabbed.

379
00:19:29,202 --> 00:19:30,721
For the record,

380
00:19:30,824 --> 00:19:33,517
I paid for at least
twice of what we stole.

381
00:19:33,620 --> 00:19:35,208
Oh, Cole, you're so amazing.

382
00:19:35,312 --> 00:19:37,003
Man, he thought
that the East Coast

383
00:19:37,106 --> 00:19:39,247
was somewhere real far away.

384
00:19:39,350 --> 00:19:40,390
Did you hear him say that?

385
00:19:40,489 --> 00:19:42,940
I mean, it kind of is.

386
00:19:43,043 --> 00:19:44,148
Both coasts are.

387
00:19:44,252 --> 00:19:45,701
They call us "flyover country."

388
00:19:45,805 --> 00:19:46,909
Oh, fuck that.

389
00:19:47,013 --> 00:19:48,311
Yeah, man, people don't
know what they're missing.

390
00:19:48,394 --> 00:19:50,706
This place is like paradise.

391
00:19:50,810 --> 00:19:53,364
Ow, ow, ow!

392
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:55,849
-Hey, baby?
-Yeah.

393
00:19:55,953 --> 00:19:57,920
I gotta go piss.

394
00:19:58,024 --> 00:19:59,681
-Classy as always, Matt.
-Thanks, man.

395
00:19:59,784 --> 00:20:01,855
Hey, uh, don't roofie
my drink when I'm gone.

396
00:20:01,959 --> 00:20:03,616
No guarantees.

397
00:20:04,927 --> 00:20:05,997
So, uh,

398
00:20:06,101 --> 00:20:07,344
the sheriff was saying

399
00:20:07,447 --> 00:20:09,863
that the factory
burnt down recently?

400
00:20:13,350 --> 00:20:14,834
Uh... yeah.

401
00:20:16,353 --> 00:20:17,457
We, um,

402
00:20:17,561 --> 00:20:19,977
we filmed one of
our videos in there.

403
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:21,565
We snuck in.

404
00:20:21,668 --> 00:20:23,498
We shouldn't have, I know,

405
00:20:23,601 --> 00:20:25,810
but we didn't actually
start the fire.

406
00:20:27,605 --> 00:20:28,261
Who did?

407
00:20:28,365 --> 00:20:29,158
Nobody.

408
00:20:29,262 --> 00:20:31,126
Faulty wiring.

409
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:33,508
Official conclusion.

410
00:20:33,611 --> 00:20:34,805
But it's too big a coincidence,

411
00:20:34,888 --> 00:20:36,269
so nobody believes that.

412
00:20:36,373 --> 00:20:38,306
Including us.

413
00:20:42,241 --> 00:20:45,830
What, you think
someone set you up?

414
00:20:57,463 --> 00:20:58,878
Okay, what in the fuck was that?

415
00:21:16,689 --> 00:21:17,966
Quinn! Quinn!

416
00:21:18,069 --> 00:21:21,003
It's-it's not... It's...

417
00:21:22,281 --> 00:21:23,661
Smile, Philly girl.

418
00:21:23,765 --> 00:21:26,768
You're about to become
a YouTube sensation.

419
00:21:26,871 --> 00:21:28,287
We got you good.

420
00:21:28,390 --> 00:21:30,910
I can't believe
she fell for that.

421
00:21:31,013 --> 00:21:32,242
You guys are fucking
idiots, you know that?

422
00:21:32,325 --> 00:21:33,775
You guys are all idiots.

423
00:21:33,878 --> 00:21:35,742
Welcome to the club.

424
00:21:38,020 --> 00:21:40,077
You must be counting the days
till you can get out of here.

425
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:41,092
-No.
-No?

426
00:21:41,196 --> 00:21:42,473
-No...
-Bullshit.

427
00:21:42,577 --> 00:21:45,442
Yes, I literally have
a calendar in my room,

428
00:21:45,545 --> 00:21:46,808
and I'm, like,
X-ing off the days.

429
00:21:46,891 --> 00:21:48,099
I'm not even kidding.

430
00:21:48,203 --> 00:21:49,308
It's not a joke.

431
00:21:49,411 --> 00:21:52,656
It's so sad, just
this, like, red marker.

432
00:21:55,210 --> 00:21:56,176
So, what comes next, then?

433
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:58,075
Just... just off to college?

434
00:21:58,178 --> 00:21:59,766
Uh, yeah.

435
00:21:59,870 --> 00:22:00,974
What about you?

436
00:22:01,078 --> 00:22:02,528
No.

437
00:22:02,631 --> 00:22:04,357
I got big plans for this town.

438
00:22:04,461 --> 00:22:05,669
Really?

439
00:22:05,772 --> 00:22:06,394
Mm-hmm.

440
00:22:06,497 --> 00:22:07,843
Like what?

441
00:22:07,947 --> 00:22:10,605
Burning it all to
the fucking ground.

442
00:22:10,708 --> 00:22:11,868
I guess you're halfway there.

443
00:22:20,822 --> 00:22:22,651
So, what, it's just
you and your dad here?

444
00:22:22,755 --> 00:22:23,894
Yeah.

445
00:22:24,964 --> 00:22:27,035
Yeah.

446
00:22:34,007 --> 00:22:38,011
My mom died of an
overdose over the summer.

447
00:22:38,115 --> 00:22:39,668
So yeah, it's just us.

448
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:45,640
Fuck.

449
00:22:45,743 --> 00:22:46,572
-It's okay...
-I'm so sorry.

450
00:22:46,675 --> 00:22:47,883
It's okay, no, no, no.

451
00:22:47,987 --> 00:22:50,196
I... my dad had,
like, a breakdown

452
00:22:50,299 --> 00:22:52,267
and couldn't go back to the ER.

453
00:22:52,371 --> 00:22:55,408
Um, so...

454
00:22:55,512 --> 00:22:57,085
I guess Kettle Springs
just had an opening

455
00:22:57,168 --> 00:22:59,136
for a family doctor, and, um...

456
00:23:01,863 --> 00:23:02,967
here we are.

457
00:23:13,081 --> 00:23:17,085
My younger sister
died last summer, too.

458
00:23:20,709 --> 00:23:23,263
We used to hang out at this
reservoir all the time,

459
00:23:23,367 --> 00:23:24,506
and...

460
00:23:26,784 --> 00:23:29,338
she wanted to jump off
the cliff into the water.

461
00:23:29,442 --> 00:23:32,687
She just didn't jump far enough.

462
00:23:40,798 --> 00:23:42,697
Uh, I'm sorry, am I
interrupting something?

463
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:46,632
Because we have a
fucking video to finish.

464
00:23:49,117 --> 00:23:50,843
Okay.

Yeah.

470
00:24:16,178 --> 00:24:17,456
Total surprise.

471
00:24:17,559 --> 00:24:19,250
In like a good
way, though, right?

472
00:24:19,354 --> 00:24:20,942
Yeah, in a good way.

473
00:24:21,045 --> 00:24:22,909
Okay, cool.

474
00:24:23,013 --> 00:24:26,223
Thanks for listening
to all my shit.

475
00:24:26,326 --> 00:24:28,501

00:24:42,135 --> 00:24:43,827
What the hell? You
know what time it is?

480
00:24:43,930 --> 00:24:45,587
Sorry. Sorry,
sorry, sorry, sorry.

481
00:24:45,691 --> 00:24:47,589
We were out, and I
lost track of time.

482
00:24:47,693 --> 00:24:49,488
What? Oh, and you've
been drinking.

483
00:24:51,628 --> 00:24:53,112
Who are you?

484
00:24:53,215 --> 00:24:55,355
Uh, Cole Hill, sir.

485
00:24:55,459 --> 00:24:57,185
Uh, don't worry, I'm
totally okay to drive.

486
00:24:57,288 --> 00:24:58,531
I had two drinks in four hours.

487
00:24:58,635 --> 00:25:00,346
Yeah, that's two too many
for somebody your age.

488
00:25:00,429 --> 00:25:02,629
Okay, but realistically,
everyone drinks in high school.

489
00:25:05,193 --> 00:25:07,954
That being said, it
will never happen again.

490
00:25:08,058 --> 00:25:09,266
Yeah, it won't,

491
00:25:09,369 --> 00:25:10,874
because you won't be seeing
my daughter ever again.

492
00:25:10,957 --> 00:25:11,855
Dad, stop.

493
00:25:11,958 --> 00:25:12,718
Go home now.

494
00:25:12,821 --> 00:25:13,442
Go home!

495
00:25:13,546 --> 00:25:15,030
Dad, can you stop?

496
00:25:16,169 --> 00:25:17,550
Oh, my god...

497
00:25:21,209 --> 00:25:22,210
Fuck.

498
00:25:22,313 --> 00:25:25,454
It's not my fault the
cell reception sucks here.

499
00:25:25,558 --> 00:25:27,387
You cannot run away

500
00:25:27,491 --> 00:25:28,651
without telling me
where you're going.

501
00:25:28,734 --> 00:25:29,928
What, like how you just ran off

502
00:25:30,011 --> 00:25:30,874
and moved us to the
middle of nowhere

503
00:25:30,977 --> 00:25:32,057
without asking me about it?

504
00:25:33,393 --> 00:25:34,498
I asked you.

505
00:25:34,602 --> 00:25:36,327
Yeah, and I said I
didn't want to go.

506
00:25:36,431 --> 00:25:37,639
Quinn, that's not fair.

507
00:25:37,743 --> 00:25:38,937
I asked you, and you said
that you'd be willing to go

508
00:25:39,020 --> 00:25:40,677
if it's what I needed, right?

509
00:25:40,780 --> 00:25:42,575
Exactly, exactly. If
it's what you needed.

510
00:25:42,679 --> 00:25:44,508
It never actually
mattered what I wanted.

511
00:25:44,612 --> 00:25:45,889
That's... how
can you say that?

512
00:25:45,992 --> 00:25:47,704
Of course it matters.
That's why I asked you

513
00:25:47,787 --> 00:25:48,843
in the first place...
-No, it isn't.

514
00:25:48,926 --> 00:25:49,789
No, it never mattered
what I wanted,

515
00:25:49,893 --> 00:25:51,308
because you fucking ran away.

516
00:25:51,411 --> 00:25:53,413
We ran away,

517
00:25:53,517 --> 00:25:54,746
because I guess
that's what we do now.

518
00:25:54,829 --> 00:25:56,520
We just run away
when things get hard,

519
00:25:56,624 --> 00:25:57,486
or scary,

520
00:25:57,590 --> 00:25:58,764
or fucked up,

521
00:25:58,867 --> 00:26:00,524
and I don't want to run anymore.

522
00:26:00,628 --> 00:26:02,906
I just want to be okay!

523
00:26:35,455 --> 00:26:36,455
Huh.

524
00:26:41,323 --> 00:26:44,016
What in the fuck was that?

525
00:27:02,172 --> 00:27:03,449
What the fuck?

526
00:27:27,128 --> 00:27:29,751
No way...

527
00:27:40,728 --> 00:27:43,454
Cole.

528
00:27:44,593 --> 00:27:47,320
It's payback time already, huh?

529
00:27:47,424 --> 00:27:49,012
Never prank the prankster.

530
00:27:54,258 --> 00:27:57,261
All right, game on.

531
00:28:30,709 --> 00:28:32,952
Motherfuck.

532
00:28:33,056 --> 00:28:35,265
Okay, guys, not cool.

533
00:28:36,197 --> 00:28:38,026
Matt...

534
00:28:38,130 --> 00:28:39,130
Shit.

535
00:28:52,592 --> 00:28:54,387
Cole?

536
00:28:55,492 --> 00:28:57,218
Come on, man, I can hear you.

537
00:29:05,674 --> 00:29:06,779
Gotcha!

538
00:29:08,643 --> 00:29:11,197
Matt, I swear to God.

539
00:29:18,066 --> 00:29:19,033
Okay.

540
00:29:19,136 --> 00:29:21,760
Okay, nice touch with
the plastic sheeting.

541
00:29:21,863 --> 00:29:23,071
I like it.

542
00:29:24,417 --> 00:29:25,417
Fuck.

543
00:29:37,810 --> 00:29:39,053
What the hell?

544
00:29:54,793 --> 00:29:58,866
Okay, y'all stepping
it up with this one.

545
00:30:23,235 --> 00:30:24,926
Try this on and pray it fits,

546
00:30:25,030 --> 00:30:26,479
because it's the last one.

547
00:30:28,827 --> 00:30:29,793
What is going on with this?

548
00:30:29,897 --> 00:30:31,070
It fit perfect last year.

549
00:30:31,174 --> 00:30:32,969
This was my favorite
damn jacket.

550
00:30:33,072 --> 00:30:35,074
You must have washed
it or something.

551
00:30:35,178 --> 00:30:37,076
Don't blame the dry cleaners.

552
00:30:37,180 --> 00:30:38,733
You need to lay
off that junk food.

553
00:30:38,837 --> 00:30:40,459
Junk... What?

554
00:30:40,562 --> 00:30:42,323
Hey!

555
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:46,741
Where do you think you're going?

556
00:30:46,845 --> 00:30:47,949
To the parade?

557
00:30:48,053 --> 00:30:50,331
Not after detention, you're not.

558
00:30:50,434 --> 00:30:51,767
Dad, the whole
class got detention.

559
00:30:51,850 --> 00:30:52,940
I didn't even do anything wrong.

560
00:30:53,023 --> 00:30:54,991
Mr. Vern just hates us.

561
00:30:55,094 --> 00:30:56,337
Well, did you know

562
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:59,133
that Mr. Vern's brother
committed suicide last month

563
00:30:59,236 --> 00:31:02,308
when he lost his
job at the factory?

564
00:31:04,828 --> 00:31:05,884
I'm sorry, I didn't know that.

565
00:31:05,967 --> 00:31:07,555
Oh, okay.

566
00:31:08,901 --> 00:31:11,145
That's not my fault.

567
00:31:11,248 --> 00:31:13,112
It's not your...
It's not his fault.

568
00:31:13,216 --> 00:31:14,962
You know, you've got to start
taking some responsibility.

569
00:31:15,045 --> 00:31:16,667
It's nobody's fault, baby.

570
00:31:16,771 --> 00:31:19,084
Sometimes things just happen.

571
00:31:19,187 --> 00:31:20,223
What are you doing?

572
00:31:20,326 --> 00:31:21,672
Go on, now.

573
00:31:21,776 --> 00:31:22,950
Happy Founder's Day.

574
00:31:26,919 --> 00:31:28,645
I would like to welcome you all

575
00:31:28,748 --> 00:31:30,992
to the 100th annual

576
00:31:31,096 --> 00:31:34,271
Kettle Springs
Founder's Day Parade!

577
00:31:35,755 --> 00:31:36,755
A hundred!

578
00:31:37,792 --> 00:31:39,552
Today we celebrate

579
00:31:39,656 --> 00:31:42,831
things that bring us together,

580
00:31:42,935 --> 00:31:45,075
things that keep us together,

581
00:31:45,179 --> 00:31:46,870
like tradition.

582
00:31:46,974 --> 00:31:48,354
Yeah.

583
00:31:48,458 --> 00:31:49,631
Like hard work...

584
00:31:50,978 --> 00:31:53,773
Like good old small-town values!

585
00:32:11,032 --> 00:32:13,000
Frendo!

586
00:32:18,212 --> 00:32:20,145
-Hey!
-Hey.

587
00:32:20,248 --> 00:32:22,354
You guys figure out who
that mystery Frendo is yet?

588
00:32:22,457 --> 00:32:25,909
No, but we were thinking
it might be Rust.

589
00:32:26,013 --> 00:32:27,428
He and Cole used to be friends.

590
00:32:27,531 --> 00:32:28,567
Yeah, that guy.

591
00:32:28,670 --> 00:32:30,293
He's, um...

592
00:32:30,396 --> 00:32:31,121
a little off.

593
00:32:31,225 --> 00:32:33,227
Uh, he's very off.

594
00:32:33,330 --> 00:32:36,195
Yo, you guys seen
Tucker anywhere?

595
00:32:36,299 --> 00:32:37,990
No, he's being a text bitch.

596
00:32:38,094 --> 00:32:39,164
Okay, screw Tucker.

597
00:32:39,267 --> 00:32:40,717
We're doing another video.

598
00:32:40,820 --> 00:32:41,683
Really? Here?

599
00:32:41,787 --> 00:32:43,016
Shut up, it's
gonna be hilarious,

600
00:32:43,099 --> 00:32:43,996
isn't it, Ronnie?

601
00:32:44,100 --> 00:32:45,825
Totally hilarious.

602
00:32:45,929 --> 00:32:47,275
Okay, you guys
get the wide shot.

603
00:32:47,379 --> 00:32:48,435
We're going to get
cutaways over there.

604
00:32:48,518 --> 00:32:49,346
Yeah?

605
00:32:49,450 --> 00:32:50,540
Okay, let's go.
-We'll get cutaways.

606
00:32:50,623 --> 00:32:52,418
Okay.

607
00:32:55,766 --> 00:32:57,320
-Hey.
-Hey.

608
00:32:58,873 --> 00:32:59,874
Oh...

609
00:32:59,978 --> 00:33:02,083
hop on my shoulders.

610
00:33:02,187 --> 00:33:02,981
You want me to do it?

611
00:33:03,084 --> 00:33:05,086
Come on, let's go.

612
00:33:05,949 --> 00:33:07,330
Okay.

613
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:13,853
So...

614
00:33:13,957 --> 00:33:15,441
I kind of throw this
party every year

615
00:33:15,545 --> 00:33:16,373
after the parade.

616
00:33:16,477 --> 00:33:17,754
Yeah?

617
00:33:17,857 --> 00:33:19,397
Any chance your dad will
let me take you with me?

618
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:20,584
Oh, less than zero percent.

619
00:33:20,688 --> 00:33:21,723
Awesome.

620
00:33:21,827 --> 00:33:23,415
I'll pick you up at 10:00.

621
00:33:25,589 --> 00:33:27,764
Yo, yo, yo!

622
00:33:27,867 --> 00:33:30,456
Ha ha!

623
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:33,080
No fucking way.

624
00:33:37,187 --> 00:33:39,017
-Hey!
-Shit!

625
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:41,226
Bozo, what do you
think you're doing?

626
00:33:41,329 --> 00:33:42,848
No, no, no!

627
00:33:42,951 --> 00:33:44,919
No! Shit!

628
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:47,301
Sorry, man!

629
00:33:50,994 --> 00:33:51,994
Fuck.

630
00:33:55,481 --> 00:33:56,481
What's going on?

631
00:34:08,598 --> 00:34:09,426
Cole?

632
00:34:09,530 --> 00:34:11,842
Who the hell is
responsible for this?

633
00:34:11,946 --> 00:34:13,396
I think we should
get out of here.

634
00:34:13,499 --> 00:34:14,500
Oh, yeah.

635
00:34:17,814 --> 00:34:19,264
Guys, what the fuck?

636
00:34:19,367 --> 00:34:20,161
Did you guys see that?

637
00:34:20,265 --> 00:34:22,129
What the hell was that?

638
00:34:22,232 --> 00:34:24,096
That was insane, right?
-You did this!

639
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:25,856
No, no, sir, I-I
didn't do anything.

640
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:27,099
Oh, the hell you didn't.

641
00:34:27,203 --> 00:34:28,845
You probably already
put it on the Internet.

642
00:34:28,928 --> 00:34:30,068
What...

643
00:34:30,171 --> 00:34:32,449
We literally didn't do anything.

644
00:34:32,553 --> 00:34:34,762
You sabotaged Founder's Day.

645
00:34:34,865 --> 00:34:37,040
Now sit in here and stew on it.

646
00:34:37,144 --> 00:34:38,766
Uh, Cole will call his dad.

647
00:34:38,869 --> 00:34:40,216
Good luck with that.

648
00:34:40,319 --> 00:34:42,597
I can't believe this
is actually happening.

649
00:34:42,701 --> 00:34:44,047
17 years old,

650
00:34:44,151 --> 00:34:45,172
and I've already
hit rock bottom.

651
00:34:45,255 --> 00:34:46,774
He can't actually hold us here

652
00:34:46,877 --> 00:34:48,707
without charging us, right?

653
00:34:48,810 --> 00:34:49,811
This feels illegal.

654
00:34:49,915 --> 00:34:52,262
You think he gives a
shit about what's legal?

655
00:34:53,608 --> 00:34:55,231
This is how it works
in Kettle Springs.

656
00:34:57,957 --> 00:34:59,959
I am so dead.

657
00:35:00,063 --> 00:35:01,133
Yeah,

658
00:35:01,237 --> 00:35:02,721
you are dead.

659
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:07,760
Never fuck with Frendo.

660
00:35:47,352 --> 00:35:48,905
All right, you're free to go.

661
00:35:56,740 --> 00:35:58,156
Not you, Daryl.

662
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:00,503
Aw...

663
00:36:12,756 --> 00:36:13,964
Dad...

664
00:36:19,660 --> 00:36:21,213
-What the hell, Quinn?
-I know.

665
00:36:21,317 --> 00:36:22,856
I told you to stay
away from the Hill boy.

666
00:36:22,939 --> 00:36:24,182
He didn't do anything.

667
00:36:24,285 --> 00:36:26,184
The fucking sheriff
has it out to get him.

668
00:36:26,287 --> 00:36:27,378
Yeah, maybe because he
burned down the factory

669
00:36:27,461 --> 00:36:28,289
that employed half the town...
-No. No, no,

670
00:36:28,393 --> 00:36:29,290
that was not his fault.

671
00:36:29,394 --> 00:36:30,602
That was an electrical issue.

672
00:36:30,705 --> 00:36:32,037
It was a wire that...
-Oh, he tell you that?

673
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:33,418
No, they did a
full investigation.

674
00:36:33,501 --> 00:36:34,847
He's not a liar, Dad.

675
00:36:34,951 --> 00:36:36,055
He's not even a bad guy.

676
00:36:36,159 --> 00:36:37,056
He's actually a really good guy.

677
00:36:37,160 --> 00:36:38,092
Wait, you've known
him for two days,

678
00:36:38,196 --> 00:36:39,528
you end up in
detention and now jail.

679
00:36:39,611 --> 00:36:41,889
Because the teacher
is a f... asshole.

680
00:36:41,992 --> 00:36:42,993
-Oh, okay.
-But...

681
00:36:43,097 --> 00:36:44,581
And so is the sheriff, Dad.
-Sure.

682
00:36:44,685 --> 00:36:47,239
There is something fucked up

683
00:36:47,343 --> 00:36:49,172
about the old
people in this town.

684
00:36:49,276 --> 00:36:50,104
So it's everybody else's fault.

685
00:36:50,208 --> 00:36:51,347
You know what?

686
00:36:51,450 --> 00:36:52,679
You need to face consequences
for your actions.

687
00:36:52,762 --> 00:36:53,852
You're grounded
until further notice.

688
00:36:53,935 --> 00:36:54,867
No, no, no, no, I...

689
00:36:54,971 --> 00:36:57,180
I am telling you, it was not...

690
00:36:57,284 --> 00:36:58,975
Whose car is this, by the way?
-Yeah...

691
00:36:59,078 --> 00:37:01,080
It was going to be a
surprise, but fat chance now.

692
00:37:01,184 --> 00:37:02,703
Seriously?

693
00:37:05,050 --> 00:37:06,050
Fuck.

694
00:37:12,299 --> 00:37:14,024
I don't even know
how to drive stick.

695
00:37:14,128 --> 00:37:15,750
Yeah, I know you don't.

696
00:37:19,202 --> 00:37:20,882
It was supposed to be
like a bonding thing.

697
00:37:23,275 --> 00:37:24,242
So you could experience

698
00:37:24,345 --> 00:37:26,761
all the joy and trauma
of my generation.

699
00:37:28,349 --> 00:37:30,489
Yeah, maybe some
other time, Dad.

700
00:37:32,077 --> 00:37:33,077
Yeah.

701
00:37:34,252 --> 00:37:35,252
I'm trying, Quinn.

702
00:37:41,397 --> 00:37:42,881

Three.

705
00:37:54,168 --> 00:37:55,342

It's Saturday night.

762
00:42:11,356 --> 00:42:13,185
I fell asleep in the tree stand.

763
00:42:13,289 --> 00:42:14,911
When I woke up, there he was.

764
00:42:15,912 --> 00:42:17,845
You know, that's
barely a four-pointer.

765
00:42:17,949 --> 00:42:20,109
It's a month of free dinner
while my pop's out of work.

766
00:42:23,886 --> 00:42:25,888
Rust...

767
00:42:25,991 --> 00:42:26,854
Quinn.

768
00:42:26,958 --> 00:42:29,098
Uh, yeah, we met, actually.

769
00:42:30,582 --> 00:42:33,723
Hi again. Quinn.

770
00:42:33,827 --> 00:42:39,039
Uh, Rust and I used to,
uh, go hunting together.

771
00:42:41,213 --> 00:42:43,491
Well, we're heading
to the hoedown.

772
00:42:43,595 --> 00:42:44,720
I'd tell you to come join us,

773
00:42:44,803 --> 00:42:46,550
but it looks like you
gotta go beat your meat.

774
00:42:46,633 --> 00:42:47,944
Hey, did you tell Quinn

775
00:42:48,048 --> 00:42:49,345
you used to practice
your boy-band dance moves

776
00:42:49,428 --> 00:42:50,222
in the mirror?

777
00:42:50,326 --> 00:42:52,328
Later, Rust.

778
00:42:52,431 --> 00:42:53,640
Be careful, Quinn.

779
00:43:19,044 --> 00:43:20,321
Come on.

780
00:43:24,049 --> 00:43:25,533
So what do I got to do

781
00:43:25,637 --> 00:43:27,363
to see some of
these dance moves?

782
00:43:27,466 --> 00:43:28,467
Look, all I'm saying

783
00:43:28,571 --> 00:43:30,011
is don't challenge
me to a dance-off.

784
00:43:30,780 --> 00:43:31,850
Challenge accepted.

785
00:43:31,954 --> 00:43:34,784
You're a big talker. I like it.

okay with us being here?

Oh, no, we're fully trespassing.

-So if we get arrested again...
-We won't.

789

Don't worry, we do
this every year.

Now, let me take a second

821
00:44:50,308 --> 00:44:51,896
to thank my main man,

822
00:44:51,999 --> 00:44:53,656
the one who paid
for all this shit,

823
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:55,658
the junior founder himself,

824
00:44:55,762 --> 00:44:58,074
and the future of
Kettle Springs...

825
00:44:58,178 --> 00:45:01,491

826
00:45:05,323 --> 00:45:07,014

founded this town,

831
00:45:20,441 --> 00:45:22,064

00:45:22,167 --> 00:45:23,651

of what this town used to be,

836
00:45:29,865 --> 00:45:31,383
and instead think ahead

837
00:45:31,487 --> 00:45:33,696

838
00:45:33,800 --> 00:45:35,663

00:48:41,297 --> 00:48:43,334
He sucked you into
his little web

906
00:48:43,437 --> 00:48:45,370
so he could feed on
your naive little mind.

907
00:48:45,474 --> 00:48:47,441
Oh!

908
00:48:47,545 --> 00:48:48,235
Oh, you bitch!

909
00:48:48,339 --> 00:48:50,134
You guys! You guys, stop!

910
00:48:54,655 --> 00:48:56,588
Hey, Ginger,

911
00:48:56,692 --> 00:48:58,349
you okay?

912
00:49:04,907 --> 00:49:06,288
Stop!

913
00:49:06,391 --> 00:49:08,048
Matt and Tucker, remember?

914
00:49:08,152 --> 00:49:11,224
This time, you
don't fall for it.

915
00:49:12,984 --> 00:49:15,435
Oh, my god.

916
00:49:15,538 --> 00:49:16,988
Aw, Ginger,

917
00:49:17,092 --> 00:49:18,024
did you die?

918
00:49:18,127 --> 00:49:20,509
That is so sad.

919
00:49:20,612 --> 00:49:21,648
Sucks to die so young.

920
00:49:21,751 --> 00:49:23,236
Aw...

921
00:49:24,754 --> 00:49:26,722
This is pretty pathetic.

922
00:49:26,825 --> 00:49:29,311
I know, right?

923
00:49:55,578 --> 00:49:58,029
Oh, my god, guys!

924
00:49:58,133 --> 00:50:00,100
They made a plaster
cast of Matt's head.

925
00:50:02,620 --> 00:50:03,759
Ronnie, think fast.

926
00:50:05,002 --> 00:50:06,348
You bitch!

927
00:50:06,451 --> 00:50:07,797
You got corn syrup

928
00:50:07,901 --> 00:50:09,523
all over my new top.

929
00:50:11,836 --> 00:50:15,150
Aw, baby, you look so sad.

930
00:50:15,253 --> 00:50:16,944
Did you get a little
owie on your neck?

931
00:50:17,048 --> 00:50:18,049
You guys...

932
00:50:18,153 --> 00:50:19,671
Guys...

933
00:50:21,018 --> 00:50:23,020
I can't find her pulse.

934
00:50:25,919 --> 00:50:27,679
She's fucking dead.

935
00:50:41,831 --> 00:50:44,213
Hey, check it out! It's Frendo!

936
00:50:49,287 --> 00:50:51,669
Run!

937
00:50:56,605 --> 00:50:57,605
Janet!

938
00:51:01,886 --> 00:51:02,886
-Thanks.
-Yeah.

939
00:51:04,199 --> 00:51:05,959
Run! Run!

940
00:51:08,341 --> 00:51:09,445
Sorry!

941
00:51:09,549 --> 00:51:11,344
Open the door!

942
00:51:13,656 --> 00:51:14,795
Around the back!

943
00:51:20,249 --> 00:51:21,078
Please don't.

944
00:51:21,181 --> 00:51:22,181
Duck!

945
00:51:32,917 --> 00:51:36,403
Holy shit.

946
00:51:37,922 --> 00:51:38,854
Thank you.

947
00:51:38,957 --> 00:51:40,373
Where's Cole?

948
00:51:40,476 --> 00:51:42,444
I don't know. I
was just with him.

949
00:51:42,547 --> 00:51:44,170
I don't know.

950
00:51:44,273 --> 00:51:45,895
Did anybody call 911?

951
00:51:45,999 --> 00:51:47,069
You can't.

952
00:51:47,173 --> 00:51:48,450
It's a total dead zone.

953
00:51:48,553 --> 00:51:50,348
Somebody drive
back to town, then!

954
00:51:50,452 --> 00:51:52,212
He slashed everyone's tires

955
00:51:52,316 --> 00:51:54,352
and pulled the batteries.

956
00:51:56,078 --> 00:51:57,838
Take his mask off.

957
00:52:27,937 --> 00:52:30,595
Holy fucking shit.

958
00:52:32,045 --> 00:52:34,012
That's a lot of Frendos!

959
00:52:52,790 --> 00:52:53,963
Get up!

960
00:52:55,241 --> 00:52:56,690
You gotta get up!

961
00:53:05,147 --> 00:53:05,906
Where were you?

962
00:53:06,010 --> 00:53:07,250
I was looking for you. Come on!

963
00:53:09,116 --> 00:53:10,290
Fuck!

964
00:53:10,394 --> 00:53:12,879
Come on! We gotta get inside!

965
00:53:15,088 --> 00:53:17,608
Come on, come on! Move!

966
00:53:27,169 --> 00:53:28,964
Quinn?

967
00:53:29,067 --> 00:53:29,999
You asleep already?

968
00:53:30,103 --> 00:53:32,761
Um, listen, I just wanted to say

969
00:53:32,864 --> 00:53:35,936
that I know how hard
this must be for you,

970
00:53:36,040 --> 00:53:38,732
and I can't imagine what
you're going through...

971
00:53:40,009 --> 00:53:40,941
Damn it.

972
00:53:41,045 --> 00:53:43,668
Fucking teenagers!

973
00:53:46,671 --> 00:53:48,432
I'm not getting any signal.

974
00:53:50,123 --> 00:53:51,228
They're surrounding us.

975
00:53:51,331 --> 00:53:52,298
We got you surrounded!

976
00:53:52,401 --> 00:53:54,403
There's fucking
clowns everywhere.

977
00:53:57,303 --> 00:53:59,512
There's no way out!

978
00:53:59,615 --> 00:54:02,066
Rust, not that I'm
complaining or anything,

979
00:54:02,169 --> 00:54:02,860
but do you bring
a loaded shotgun

980
00:54:02,963 --> 00:54:03,757
to every party?

981
00:54:03,861 --> 00:54:05,000
It's always in my truck,

982
00:54:05,103 --> 00:54:06,484
locked.

983
00:54:06,588 --> 00:54:07,678
That's why they didn't get it.

984
00:54:07,761 --> 00:54:09,246
Those clowns hate us.

985
00:54:09,349 --> 00:54:11,178
Ronnie, we're safe for
now. It's a steel door.

986
00:54:15,113 --> 00:54:16,149
It's over.

987
00:54:16,253 --> 00:54:18,634
We're all gonna be
headless teenagers

988
00:54:18,738 --> 00:54:19,773
without heads!

989
00:54:19,877 --> 00:54:22,086
Ronnie, Ronnie, you
need to calm down, okay?

990
00:54:22,189 --> 00:54:23,294
Look at me. Breathe.

991
00:54:24,640 --> 00:54:25,676
We're gonna kill you!

992
00:54:25,779 --> 00:54:27,526
Who the fuck are they?
Why are they doing this?

993
00:54:27,609 --> 00:54:29,369
And why is it only us?

994
00:54:29,473 --> 00:54:32,407
Never fuck with Frendo.

995
00:54:35,410 --> 00:54:37,412
We gotta go. We gotta
get out of here.

996
00:54:37,515 --> 00:54:38,709
She's right. We
can't stay here.

997
00:54:38,792 --> 00:54:40,311
What about the
Tillersons' house?

998
00:54:40,415 --> 00:54:42,140
We can use their landline
to call for help.

999
00:54:42,244 --> 00:54:44,350
That's like a mile
through a cornfield

1000
00:54:44,453 --> 00:54:46,075
in the fucking dark.

1001
00:54:46,179 --> 00:54:47,560
How many shells you got left?

1002
00:54:47,663 --> 00:54:48,699
Three.

1003
00:54:48,802 --> 00:54:49,893
You know, I never
thought I'd say this,

1004
00:54:49,976 --> 00:54:51,688
but I'm glad you're such
a fucking redneck, Rust.

1005
00:54:51,771 --> 00:54:54,083
Aw, thanks, man.
I love you, too.

1006
00:54:59,399 --> 00:55:00,697
What the hell, man?
What are you doing?

1007
00:55:00,780 --> 00:55:01,712
What? I got him!

1008
00:55:01,815 --> 00:55:04,335
Yeah, and you wasted
two shells doing it!

1009
00:55:04,439 --> 00:55:05,336
Now we only have one
left to get out of here!

1010
00:55:05,440 --> 00:55:06,441
Oh, my God,

1011
00:55:06,544 --> 00:55:08,235
can you stop being
so fucking stupid?

1012
00:55:08,339 --> 00:55:10,168
No, you know what?
You're stupid,

1013
00:55:10,272 --> 00:55:12,757
because you threw away
everything we had,

1014
00:55:12,861 --> 00:55:14,241
for what?

1015
00:55:14,345 --> 00:55:16,209
No, no, we never had anything.

1016
00:55:16,313 --> 00:55:17,417
Oh, bullshit.

1017
00:55:17,521 --> 00:55:20,386
Oh...

1018
00:55:20,489 --> 00:55:22,111
Why can't you just
admit who you are

1019
00:55:22,215 --> 00:55:23,181
for once in your fucking life?

1020
00:55:23,285 --> 00:55:25,218
Because I don't fucking know!

1021
00:55:27,462 --> 00:55:29,187
Fuck!

1022
00:55:29,291 --> 00:55:31,638
You guys?

1023
00:55:31,742 --> 00:55:33,709
There's a hole in
the ground over here.

1024
00:55:35,228 --> 00:55:36,609
Yes...

1025
00:55:38,127 --> 00:55:39,508
It's a drainage ditch.

1026
00:55:39,612 --> 00:55:41,303
Drainage for what?

1027
00:55:41,407 --> 00:55:42,994
You don't want to know.

1028
00:55:43,098 --> 00:55:44,858
Hey, I am not crawling
through a shit pipe.

1029
00:55:46,066 --> 00:55:46,998
I'm gonna kill you!

1030
00:55:47,102 --> 00:55:48,690
Never mind! Let's go.

1031
00:55:48,793 --> 00:55:49,993
Guys, they have us surrounded.

1032
00:55:50,830 --> 00:55:51,762
If we try and crawl out of here,

1033
00:55:51,865 --> 00:55:53,025
they'll just
Whac-A-Mole us to death.

1034
00:55:53,108 --> 00:55:54,730
Not if we distract them.

1035
00:55:59,873 --> 00:56:02,842
Driving around
looking for you now.

1036
00:56:02,945 --> 00:56:04,257
It's not a big town.

1037
00:56:04,361 --> 00:56:05,741
It's only a matter of time.

1038
00:56:07,571 --> 00:56:08,675
I'm not mad, Quinn.

1039
00:56:08,779 --> 00:56:11,471
Just please call me back.

1040
00:56:31,353 --> 00:56:32,630
Hello?

1041
00:56:36,220 --> 00:56:37,911
Hello?

1042
00:56:41,984 --> 00:56:43,903
I don't have any drugs here,
if that's what you want.

1043
00:56:43,986 --> 00:56:44,918
Move.

1044
00:56:45,022 --> 00:56:47,231
Don't look. Keep going.

1045
00:56:47,334 --> 00:56:48,474
Okay, okay, okay.

1046
00:57:01,763 --> 00:57:02,695
What is happening?

1047
00:57:02,798 --> 00:57:05,145
Save him, or your daughter dies.

1048
00:57:06,146 --> 00:57:07,285
Where-where is she?

1049
00:57:09,460 --> 00:57:10,288
You'll find out.

1050
00:57:10,392 --> 00:57:12,118
First, you've got work to do.

1051
00:57:13,430 --> 00:57:14,431
Okay, okay.

1052
00:57:18,055 --> 00:57:20,575
Let's hope this works.

1053
00:57:22,473 --> 00:57:23,474
I can't do it! I can't!

1054
00:57:23,578 --> 00:57:25,234
Shut up, Ronnie! Go!

1055
00:57:26,857 --> 00:57:27,947
You owe me a new
outfit after this.

1056
00:57:28,030 --> 00:57:29,929
Not the time, Janet.

1057
00:57:31,102 --> 00:57:32,932
-Don't be long.
-Try and hold your breath.

1058
00:57:34,381 --> 00:57:35,590
Are you sure about this?

1059
00:57:35,693 --> 00:57:37,557
Yeah, man. You know I
love blowing shit up.

1060
00:57:39,973 --> 00:57:43,080
Here, take this. There's
on one shot left.

1061
00:57:44,219 --> 00:57:46,566
Rust, like...

1062
00:57:46,670 --> 00:57:48,174
I'm really sorry about...
-Tell me about it later!

1063
00:57:48,257 --> 00:57:49,257
I'll be right behind you.

1064
00:57:51,019 --> 00:57:51,882
Go. Go!

1065
00:57:51,985 --> 00:57:53,366
Fuck!

1066
00:57:53,470 --> 00:57:55,437
Oh, I hate my life,

1067
00:57:55,541 --> 00:57:56,818
I hate my life, I hate my life.

1068
00:57:58,509 --> 00:58:00,511
Oh, my god...

1069
00:58:00,615 --> 00:58:01,615
Move your butt, Ronnie.

1070
00:58:37,583 --> 00:58:39,067
Oh, geez.

1071
00:58:42,449 --> 00:58:43,554
Rust...

1072
00:58:46,419 --> 00:58:48,248
W-we have to go get him.

1073
00:58:48,352 --> 00:58:50,285
We can't. We have
to go for help.

1074
00:58:51,666 --> 00:58:53,150
We have one bullet.

1075
00:58:53,253 --> 00:58:54,151
One bullet.

1076
00:58:54,254 --> 00:58:55,704
Save it.

1077
00:58:55,808 --> 00:58:57,603
We have to go to the
Tillersons' house.

1078
00:58:57,706 --> 00:58:59,501
What, through the cornfield?

1079
00:58:59,605 --> 00:59:00,813
What choice do we have?

1080
00:59:03,022 --> 00:59:04,402
Cole!

1081
00:59:04,506 --> 00:59:07,026
Aw, hell!

1082
00:59:09,407 --> 00:59:10,754
Go, go, go!

1083
00:59:27,943 --> 00:59:28,910
He's having trouble breathing.

1084
00:59:29,013 --> 00:59:31,015
Let me just...
-I said leave it on.

1085
00:59:35,572 --> 00:59:36,469
Who are you people?

1086
00:59:36,573 --> 00:59:38,298
Did I say you could talk?

1087
00:59:39,541 --> 00:59:40,784
K4, you there?

1088
00:59:40,887 --> 00:59:44,442
We got more incoming.

1089
00:59:44,546 --> 00:59:46,617
Roger that. Send 'em
down. Doc's here.

1090
00:59:46,721 --> 00:59:48,205
Copy!

1091
00:59:54,936 --> 00:59:56,282
I need more saline.

1092
00:59:56,385 --> 00:59:57,973
What?

1093
00:59:58,077 --> 00:59:59,147
He's in shock.

1094
00:59:59,250 --> 01:00:00,514
He's going to die if he
doesn't get more fluids.

1095
01:00:00,597 --> 01:00:01,528
I need more saline.

1096
01:00:01,632 --> 01:00:03,807
Well, why don't you get some?

1097
01:00:05,118 --> 01:00:07,396
'Cause I'm in the
middle of an operation.

1098
01:00:07,500 --> 01:00:09,640
Fine. Where is it?

1099
01:00:11,021 --> 01:00:12,332
In the cabinet behind you.

1100
01:00:25,345 --> 01:00:26,553
Where?

1101
01:00:26,657 --> 01:00:28,003
Um, it's in the bottom drawer.

1102
01:00:29,108 --> 01:00:30,834
Come on, come on, come on...

1103
01:00:37,323 --> 01:00:38,393
Here.

1104
01:00:50,819 --> 01:00:52,407
Sorry about tonight, Quinn.

1105
01:00:52,510 --> 01:00:53,580
Oh, it's okay.

1106
01:00:53,684 --> 01:00:55,997
Don't worry about it.

1107
01:00:56,100 --> 01:00:58,226
You know, except for the clowns
trying to kill us and all.

1108
01:00:58,309 --> 01:00:59,759
That kind of sucks.

1109
01:00:59,863 --> 01:01:00,691
Ow!

1110
01:01:00,795 --> 01:01:01,727
This corn hurts.

1111
01:01:01,830 --> 01:01:03,004
Shut up, Ronnie.

1112
01:01:03,107 --> 01:01:04,453
I can't shut up.

1113
01:01:04,557 --> 01:01:06,248
Fuck, it's like we're in

1114
01:01:06,352 --> 01:01:09,666
some awful '80s slasher
horror movie in the corn.

1115
01:01:09,769 --> 01:01:10,809
Which means what, exactly?

1116
01:01:12,599 --> 01:01:14,153
It means I'm next.

1117
01:01:14,256 --> 01:01:15,050
Okay, stop it!

1118
01:01:15,154 --> 01:01:17,294
Guys, there's the road.

1119
01:01:18,847 --> 01:01:20,607
There's a car coming.

1120
01:01:20,711 --> 01:01:22,644
Come on.
-Let's go.

1121
01:01:22,748 --> 01:01:23,645
Hey, hey!

1122
01:01:23,749 --> 01:01:25,992
-Hey, wait!
-Hey!

1123
01:01:31,342 --> 01:01:33,172
Oh, shit.

1124
01:01:34,932 --> 01:01:37,210
Please tell me that isn't
the fucking sheriff.

1125
01:01:39,212 --> 01:01:40,800
Put the gun down.

1126
01:01:40,904 --> 01:01:43,216
Sir? Sir, I... I
know this looks bad,

1127
01:01:43,320 --> 01:01:44,631
but this isn't mine.

1128
01:01:44,735 --> 01:01:45,632
Put the gun down now,

1129
01:01:45,736 --> 01:01:46,564
and back away.

1130
01:01:46,668 --> 01:01:47,704
Okay.

1131
01:01:47,807 --> 01:01:49,001
Sheriff, you don't understand.

1132
01:01:49,084 --> 01:01:51,086
Yeah, yeah, yeah, we
were attacked by clowns!

1133
01:01:51,190 --> 01:01:53,882
All right,

1134
01:01:53,986 --> 01:01:56,505
I've had about enough
of you, thanks.

1135
01:01:56,989 --> 01:01:58,784
It-it-it... This
wasn't me, okay?

1136
01:01:58,887 --> 01:01:59,750
Whoa, whoa, what?

1137
01:01:59,854 --> 01:02:00,820
No, no, no.

1138
01:02:00,924 --> 01:02:02,373
Quinn, no.
-Wait, wait, wait!

1139
01:02:02,477 --> 01:02:03,858
No, no, no.

1140
01:02:03,961 --> 01:02:04,790
Sheriff, you don't understand.

1141
01:02:04,893 --> 01:02:05,984
There's a massacre going on.

1142
01:02:06,067 --> 01:02:07,088
There's a bunch of
dead people back there.

1143
01:02:07,171 --> 01:02:08,448
Anything you say

1144
01:02:08,552 --> 01:02:10,278
can and will be used against you

1145
01:02:10,381 --> 01:02:11,866
in a court of law.

1146
01:02:11,969 --> 01:02:13,695
What is happening?

1147
01:02:13,799 --> 01:02:15,079
Why is everyone so fucking mean?

1148
01:02:15,179 --> 01:02:15,973
Hey!

1149
01:02:16,077 --> 01:02:17,837
Watch your language, girlie.

1150
01:02:17,941 --> 01:02:19,494
This is not a joke.

1151
01:02:19,597 --> 01:02:20,529
There's a bunch of psychos

1152
01:02:20,633 --> 01:02:21,634
dressed up like Frendo

1153
01:02:21,738 --> 01:02:23,809
who are trying to kill us!

1154
01:02:25,327 --> 01:02:26,812
Oh, my god.

1155
01:02:26,915 --> 01:02:28,434
Oh, that's my bad.

1156
01:02:28,537 --> 01:02:30,160
All right, okay,
y'all are making

1157
01:02:30,263 --> 01:02:31,457
one of your little
goofy Internet videos?

1158
01:02:31,540 --> 01:02:32,576
Is that what's happening?

1159
01:02:32,679 --> 01:02:34,958
Your little dirtbag
friends out there

1160
01:02:35,061 --> 01:02:35,821
filming me from the cornfield?

1161
01:02:35,924 --> 01:02:36,891
Is that right?

1162
01:02:36,994 --> 01:02:38,271
There's no camera, you idiot!

1163
01:02:38,375 --> 01:02:39,997
We're in a bunch of
danger right now!

1164
01:02:40,101 --> 01:02:40,964
Shut up, you're the one

1165
01:02:41,067 --> 01:02:42,330
who's in a bunch
of danger, homeboy.

1166
01:02:42,413 --> 01:02:43,849
-Wait, wait, wait!
-It's real, Sheriff.

1167
01:02:43,932 --> 01:02:44,864
I swear to God.

1168
01:02:44,968 --> 01:02:46,832
They have chainsaws
and-and axes...

1169
01:02:46,935 --> 01:02:48,488
Yeah, and-and pitchforks,

1170
01:02:48,592 --> 01:02:50,456
and my boyfriend's head!

1171
01:02:50,559 --> 01:02:52,458
Y'all had a shotgun,

1172
01:02:52,561 --> 01:02:53,597
so what's your problem?

1173
01:02:53,700 --> 01:02:55,357
This is insane. This is...

1174
01:02:55,461 --> 01:02:57,069
What? This is insane. Why
won't you listen to us?

1175
01:02:57,152 --> 01:02:58,464
Wait, wait, wait, arrest me too!

1176
01:02:58,567 --> 01:02:59,810
Please just get me out of here.

1177
01:02:59,914 --> 01:03:01,674
Next time, toots.

1178
01:03:01,778 --> 01:03:03,317
Y'all have a pleasant
rest of your night.

1179
01:03:03,400 --> 01:03:04,297
No, no, no, no, no.

1180
01:03:04,401 --> 01:03:05,678
No, no, no, don't!

1181
01:03:05,782 --> 01:03:08,888
We need help! We need help!

1182
01:03:08,992 --> 01:03:13,444
How do we have the worst
sheriff in America?

1183
01:03:13,548 --> 01:03:15,688
What the hell?

1184
01:03:15,792 --> 01:03:17,103
Why did he only arrest Cole?

1185
01:03:18,795 --> 01:03:20,395
Okay, let's get to
the Tillersons' house.

1186
01:03:20,486 --> 01:03:21,694
We can call for help there.

1187
01:03:21,798 --> 01:03:22,695
How far is it?

1188
01:03:22,799 --> 01:03:24,041
Not far. Come on.

1189
01:03:24,145 --> 01:03:27,562
What? Wait, wait, wait, no.
I'm not going back in there!

1190
01:03:27,665 --> 01:03:28,528
I'm drawing the line, okay?

1191
01:03:28,632 --> 01:03:30,841
I'm drawing the line right here!

1192
01:03:34,672 --> 01:03:35,672
Oh, shit.

1193
01:03:36,916 --> 01:03:38,538
Wait!

1194
01:03:38,642 --> 01:03:40,092
Wait!

1195
01:04:17,405 --> 01:04:19,027
What?

1196
01:04:20,822 --> 01:04:21,822
Run!

1197
01:04:46,503 --> 01:04:47,849
Wrong way!

1198
01:04:47,953 --> 01:04:49,092
Change of plans!

1199
01:04:59,792 --> 01:05:00,792
Shh. Shh.

1200
01:05:32,376 --> 01:05:35,345
We're gonna die.

1201
01:06:20,424 --> 01:06:22,599
Oh, my God!

1202
01:06:23,841 --> 01:06:25,395
Oh, my god!

1203
01:06:42,343 --> 01:06:44,690
Did you seriously just
ring the doorbell?

1204
01:06:44,793 --> 01:06:46,933
Well, do we just go in?

1205
01:06:47,727 --> 01:06:50,765
I think we're past the point
of pleasantries, Janet, yeah.

1206
01:06:57,634 --> 01:06:58,635
Do you see a phone?

1207
01:06:58,738 --> 01:06:59,912
Shh...

1208
01:07:04,641 --> 01:07:06,022
Is he dead?

1209
01:07:06,125 --> 01:07:09,473
Well, I don't think
he's meditating.

1210
01:07:27,629 --> 01:07:29,424
I think he's dead.

1211
01:07:30,667 --> 01:07:31,530
It's a phone!

1212
01:07:31,633 --> 01:07:32,703
Oh, my god.

1213
01:07:32,807 --> 01:07:33,911
Upstairs.

1214
01:07:34,015 --> 01:07:35,120
Let's go.

1215
01:07:39,055 --> 01:07:40,159
There it is!

1216
01:07:41,574 --> 01:07:42,574
Hello?

1217
01:07:43,438 --> 01:07:45,268
Hello?

1218
01:07:45,371 --> 01:07:46,476
What?

1219
01:07:47,684 --> 01:07:48,616
Look... I think the ph...

1220
01:07:48,719 --> 01:07:49,651
I think the line is dead.

1221
01:07:49,755 --> 01:07:51,170
Okay, call 911.

1222
01:07:51,274 --> 01:07:52,930
Well, where's the button, Janet?

1223
01:07:53,034 --> 01:07:54,056
Uh, what is this?
What is this?

1224
01:07:54,139 --> 01:07:56,693
What the fuck kind
of phone is this?

1225
01:08:03,665 --> 01:08:05,081
Quinn...

1226
01:08:06,116 --> 01:08:08,256
Holy shit.

1227
01:08:12,226 --> 01:08:14,435
What is this?

1228
01:08:35,973 --> 01:08:37,216
This was a trap.

1229
01:08:40,461 --> 01:08:42,118
We gotta get out of here.

1230
01:08:46,225 --> 01:08:47,192
Oh, shit!

1231
01:08:47,295 --> 01:08:49,573
He was meditating!

1232
01:08:57,995 --> 01:09:00,170
Oh, shit, Janet!

1233
01:09:04,968 --> 01:09:05,934
Oh, god, is it bad?

1234
01:09:06,038 --> 01:09:06,935
Is it bad? I can't look.

1235
01:09:07,039 --> 01:09:07,833
Oh, my god, it's bad.

1236
01:09:07,936 --> 01:09:09,593
Oh, it's so bad, girl.

1237
01:09:09,697 --> 01:09:11,857
Fuck, stay still, stay still,
stay still, stay still...

1238
01:09:13,770 --> 01:09:14,426
I know, I know, I know!

1239
01:09:14,529 --> 01:09:15,889
Don't let me die,
don't let me die.

1240
01:09:18,706 --> 01:09:21,743
-No, no, no, no, no!
-I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry!

1241
01:09:27,404 --> 01:09:30,580
I hate you, Quinn.

1242
01:09:31,926 --> 01:09:33,893
Me too.

1243
01:09:39,347 --> 01:09:40,969
Oh, fuck.

1244
01:09:44,835 --> 01:09:45,905
Jeez...

1245
01:09:50,082 --> 01:09:54,397
Come on, hurry it up.

1246
01:09:54,500 --> 01:09:56,951
This is taking too long!

1247
01:10:09,826 --> 01:10:10,896
What happened?

1248
01:10:10,999 --> 01:10:11,828
He's flatlining.

1249
01:10:11,931 --> 01:10:14,071
Um, look, I need your help.

1250
01:10:14,175 --> 01:10:15,003
Me?

1251
01:10:15,107 --> 01:10:16,177
Yeah, yeah, you!

1252
01:10:16,281 --> 01:10:17,074
Come on, take it, take it!

1253
01:10:17,178 --> 01:10:18,303
What are you looking at me for?

1254
01:10:18,386 --> 01:10:19,891
Take 'em, take 'em, take
'em, take 'em, take 'em!

1255
01:10:19,974 --> 01:10:21,389
Come on, yeah, yeah, yeah!

1256
01:10:21,493 --> 01:10:24,150
Ready? One, two...

1257
01:10:24,254 --> 01:10:25,428
Fuck the Hippocratic oath!

1258
01:10:30,743 --> 01:10:31,710
You shouldn't have done that.

1259
01:10:31,813 --> 01:10:33,229
Sorry.

1260
01:10:33,332 --> 01:10:34,354
Um, you're going to want
to leave that in there.

1261
01:10:34,437 --> 01:10:35,300
I'm going to get some help.

1262
01:10:35,403 --> 01:10:37,302
No, no. What are you doing?

1263
01:10:37,405 --> 01:10:38,958
No, no. No, no, no, I just...

1264
01:10:39,062 --> 01:10:40,166
Ah...

1265
01:10:40,270 --> 01:10:41,858
Okay, that's...

1266
01:10:41,961 --> 01:10:42,755
Now you're gonna bleed out.

1267
01:10:42,859 --> 01:10:44,101
Yeah. See?

1268
01:10:44,205 --> 01:10:45,482
That's...

1269
01:10:45,586 --> 01:10:46,966
This is exactly
what I was saying.

1270
01:10:47,070 --> 01:10:48,554
Aah!

1271
01:10:57,218 --> 01:10:58,806
Don't say I didn't warn you.

1272
01:11:01,567 --> 01:11:02,706
It's all going wrong!

1273
01:11:02,810 --> 01:11:04,418
Goddamn it! We shouldn't
have done it like this!

1274
01:11:04,501 --> 01:11:05,847
This is not my fault!

1275
01:11:05,951 --> 01:11:08,022
The damn girl's tougher
than we thought!

1276
01:11:08,125 --> 01:11:08,954
Just get her

1277
01:11:09,057 --> 01:11:10,631
and bring her back to
the Baypen factory!

1278
01:11:10,714 --> 01:11:11,784
Oh, my God.

1279
01:11:11,888 --> 01:11:14,580
-We'll deal with her there.
-Roger that.

1280
01:11:51,376 --> 01:11:52,756
Damn it!

1281
01:12:10,774 --> 01:12:11,741
Goddamn it!

1282
01:12:11,844 --> 01:12:13,107
No, don't do this
to me right now.

1283
01:12:13,190 --> 01:12:14,364
Oh, no, no, no, no.

1284
01:12:16,262 --> 01:12:17,862
No, please don't do
this to me right now.

1285
01:12:18,886 --> 01:12:20,612
Aah!

1286
01:12:20,715 --> 01:12:22,061
Damn it!

1287
01:12:22,165 --> 01:12:24,443
When your dad wants to
teach you to drive stick,

1288
01:12:24,547 --> 01:12:26,859
you fucking say yes!

1289
01:13:21,880 --> 01:13:24,158
Who the hell are you people?

1290
01:13:30,406 --> 01:13:31,890
Aw.

1291
01:13:35,652 --> 01:13:38,137
Welcome to the main
event, sweetie pie.

1292
01:13:42,625 --> 01:13:45,455
My fucking face hurts.

1293
01:13:45,559 --> 01:13:47,112
Don't complain.

1294
01:13:47,215 --> 01:13:49,459
I gotta work in the morning.

1295
01:13:49,563 --> 01:13:51,461
Work? This is work.

1296
01:13:51,565 --> 01:13:53,774
This is the best damn
job I've ever had.

1297
01:13:56,224 --> 01:13:57,122
Better than my day job.

1298
01:13:57,225 --> 01:13:59,814
Yeah, you're a lot
fucking better at it, too.

1299
01:13:59,918 --> 01:14:00,988
Language, sweetheart.

1300
01:14:09,617 --> 01:14:11,723
Why are you doing this?

1301
01:14:11,826 --> 01:14:13,000
Because...

1302
01:14:14,484 --> 01:14:17,004
it's a Founder's Day tradition!

1303
01:14:25,426 --> 01:14:29,154
I mean, only when
necessary, of course.

1304
01:14:34,953 --> 01:14:37,231
You're Cole's dad.

1305
01:14:37,334 --> 01:14:39,095
No.

1306
01:14:39,198 --> 01:14:41,960
No, Cole's no son of mine.

1307
01:14:42,063 --> 01:14:43,651
I disowned him.

1308
01:14:45,032 --> 01:14:46,551
Oh, come on, please
just let me go.

1309
01:14:46,654 --> 01:14:47,759
No, no, no, no.

1310
01:14:47,862 --> 01:14:50,416
It's way too late
for that, toots.

1311
01:14:50,520 --> 01:14:51,348
I didn't do anything.

1312
01:14:51,452 --> 01:14:53,281
Shh.

1313
01:14:54,490 --> 01:14:56,526
Shh.

1314
01:14:58,459 --> 01:15:02,325
You know, Kettle
Springs is a good town,

1315
01:15:02,428 --> 01:15:04,258
filled with good people, right?

1316
01:15:04,361 --> 01:15:05,431
Uh-huh.

1317
01:15:05,535 --> 01:15:06,432
That's right, it is.

1318
01:15:06,536 --> 01:15:07,744
Best of America...

1319
01:15:09,021 --> 01:15:10,782
what's left of it.

1320
01:15:10,885 --> 01:15:14,648
And keeping it that
way all these years

1321
01:15:14,751 --> 01:15:16,201
hasn't been easy.

1322
01:15:17,513 --> 01:15:20,343
It takes vigilance,

1323
01:15:20,446 --> 01:15:23,864
because every couple
of generations,

1324
01:15:23,967 --> 01:15:27,177
well, we get
ourselves a bad crop.

1325
01:15:27,281 --> 01:15:29,214
I'm not even from here.

1326
01:15:30,249 --> 01:15:31,043
Go ahead.

1327
01:15:31,147 --> 01:15:32,424
Oh, no, no, no, no, no!

1328
01:15:39,396 --> 01:15:40,881
Now, listen.

1329
01:15:40,984 --> 01:15:44,747
In the '30s, Baypen
became the national brand.

1330
01:15:44,850 --> 01:15:46,921
It kept this town afloat, right?

1331
01:15:47,025 --> 01:15:48,095
Uh-huh. You can say that.

1332
01:15:48,198 --> 01:15:52,513
And then this big old
train full of hobos

1333
01:15:52,617 --> 01:15:54,688
just rolled on into town,

1334
01:15:54,791 --> 01:15:57,173
and they just didn't
want to leave.

1335
01:15:57,276 --> 01:16:00,072
No, and then we had some
hippies in the '60s.

1336
01:16:00,176 --> 01:16:02,178
They came in and
started a commune,

1337
01:16:02,281 --> 01:16:03,766
sold dope to kids,

1338
01:16:03,869 --> 01:16:05,526
and then, oh, in the '90s,

1339
01:16:05,630 --> 01:16:08,805
we all know what
kind of burnouts

1340
01:16:08,909 --> 01:16:10,600
those guys were, man.

1341
01:16:14,362 --> 01:16:16,606
But your generation,

1342
01:16:16,710 --> 01:16:19,782
with your...

1343
01:16:19,885 --> 01:16:23,613
your fucking preening and
your goddamn cat videos,

1344
01:16:23,717 --> 01:16:27,375
well, you guys might be
the worst of them all.

1345
01:16:27,479 --> 01:16:30,344
Cancer.

1346
01:16:30,447 --> 01:16:32,518
A scourge!

1347
01:16:32,622 --> 01:16:35,245
A blighted crop is what you are,

1348
01:16:35,349 --> 01:16:37,247
that needs to be culled!

1349
01:16:38,317 --> 01:16:39,733
Oh, Cole!

1350
01:16:39,836 --> 01:16:40,941
Cole!

1351
01:16:41,044 --> 01:16:42,459
Surprise!

1352
01:16:42,563 --> 01:16:45,014
What are you doing?
He's your son!

1353
01:16:45,117 --> 01:16:47,154
No, I told you, he isn't my son,

1354
01:16:47,257 --> 01:16:48,707
not since he killed
his own sister.

1355
01:16:48,811 --> 01:16:50,122
He didn't kill her.

1356
01:16:50,226 --> 01:16:51,814
-It was on his watch!
-She drowned!

1357
01:16:51,917 --> 01:16:54,333
He took everything from me,

1358
01:16:54,437 --> 01:16:57,267
everything that I cared about,

1359
01:16:57,371 --> 01:16:59,407
and then you burned down
the goddamn factory.

1360
01:16:59,511 --> 01:17:00,857
That was the last straw, Cole.

1361
01:17:00,961 --> 01:17:03,308
I just came to the realization

1362
01:17:03,411 --> 01:17:07,036
that my boy is just a bad seed,

1363
01:17:07,139 --> 01:17:09,245
and Daddy has to start all over.

1364
01:17:10,384 --> 01:17:13,283
Oh, my god, you're insane.

1365
01:17:13,387 --> 01:17:14,526
You're an insane person!

1366
01:17:14,630 --> 01:17:18,599
I'm just doing what my
daddy did before me,

1367
01:17:18,703 --> 01:17:20,014
and his daddy did before him.

1368
01:17:20,118 --> 01:17:21,982
Tradition.

1369
01:17:23,259 --> 01:17:24,260
You really think

1370
01:17:24,363 --> 01:17:26,296
you're going to be able
to get away with this?

1371
01:17:26,400 --> 01:17:27,988
Look.

1372
01:17:28,091 --> 01:17:31,405
Would you like to see
Cole's suicide note? Hmm?

1373
01:17:31,508 --> 01:17:35,478
It's going live on his
socials tomorrow morning.

1374
01:17:35,581 --> 01:17:36,582
Yup!

1375
01:17:36,686 --> 01:17:39,344
Another spoiled rich kid

1376
01:17:39,447 --> 01:17:40,656
that shoots up a party,

1377
01:17:40,759 --> 01:17:43,520
and then he kills the
girl that spurned him

1378
01:17:43,624 --> 01:17:47,179
right before he kills himself.

1379
01:17:47,283 --> 01:17:49,319
Affluenza's a bitch.

1380
01:17:49,423 --> 01:17:51,183
Yeah.

1381
01:17:51,287 --> 01:17:54,014
Yeah, I would say so.

1382
01:17:54,117 --> 01:17:55,601
So let's go.

1383
01:17:55,705 --> 01:17:57,017
Let's get this show on the road.

1384
01:17:57,120 --> 01:17:58,708
You're fucking
sick, you know that?

1385
01:18:00,020 --> 01:18:02,401
You just pretend to care.

1386
01:18:02,505 --> 01:18:04,079
You're so worried about
what's wrong with the kids,

1387
01:18:04,162 --> 01:18:06,081
when you guys are the ones
that fucked everything up!

1388
01:18:06,164 --> 01:18:08,131
You don't care about the Earth.

1389
01:18:08,235 --> 01:18:09,463
You don't care about
the next generation.

1390
01:18:09,546 --> 01:18:10,478
Well, guess what,

1391
01:18:10,582 --> 01:18:12,826
the world's going to change

1392
01:18:12,929 --> 01:18:16,001
whether you like it or not,

1393
01:18:16,105 --> 01:18:18,107
and I know that scares
the shit out of you...

1394
01:18:19,556 --> 01:18:21,973
because if you can't have things
the way that you want 'em,

1395
01:18:22,076 --> 01:18:24,769
you'd rather burn it all
to the fucking ground!

1396
01:18:28,393 --> 01:18:31,983
You'd rather kill
us than just listen.

1397
01:18:34,502 --> 01:18:35,952
Let's hear it for Cole.

1398
01:18:36,056 --> 01:18:37,505
That was beautiful.

1399
01:18:37,609 --> 01:18:38,506
That was beautiful!

1400
01:18:38,610 --> 01:18:39,887
You know what?

1401
01:18:39,991 --> 01:18:42,545
I'm gonna put that
into the suicide note.

1402
01:18:42,648 --> 01:18:43,546
I mean, I'm not going to put in

1403
01:18:43,649 --> 01:18:45,134
all the gory details and stuff,

1404
01:18:45,237 --> 01:18:47,170
but, um, you know,
I'll put a lot of it.

1405
01:18:47,274 --> 01:18:49,725
Jesus fucking Christ,
this is endless.

1406
01:18:49,828 --> 01:18:51,623
Can we get on with it, please?

1407
01:18:51,727 --> 01:18:53,383
Well, yes, sir.

1408
01:18:53,487 --> 01:18:56,007
Thank you.

1409
01:18:56,110 --> 01:18:57,270
Listen, sweetheart,
I'm really sorry.

1410
01:18:57,353 --> 01:18:59,389
I mean, I... I
tried to warn you,

1411
01:18:59,493 --> 01:19:00,943
but you didn't listen.

1412
01:19:01,357 --> 01:19:02,634
Dumb fuck!

1413
01:19:02,738 --> 01:19:05,257
Just like the rest of
your goddamn generation.

1414
01:19:05,361 --> 01:19:06,465
No! No!

1415
01:19:35,701 --> 01:19:37,842
Sheriff?

1416
01:19:37,945 --> 01:19:39,809
I'm okay, right?

1417
01:19:41,155 --> 01:19:42,155
Uh...

1418
01:19:51,545 --> 01:19:52,960
Dad!

1419
01:19:53,064 --> 01:19:54,859
Cole! Get Cole!

1420
01:20:05,801 --> 01:20:07,975
Dad!

1421
01:20:09,425 --> 01:20:11,013
Run, Quinn.

1422
01:20:11,116 --> 01:20:13,222
Run!

1423
01:20:15,155 --> 01:20:16,673
Shit!

1424
01:20:20,332 --> 01:20:21,644
Dunne...

1425
01:20:21,747 --> 01:20:24,164
You go get her, I got Cole.

1426
01:21:00,476 --> 01:21:01,580
Hey, Doc...

1427
01:21:30,506 --> 01:21:32,922
Come on, come on, come on...

1428
01:22:03,539 --> 01:22:05,472
It's over, sweetheart.

1429
01:22:08,716 --> 01:22:11,271
Come on out, now. There
ain't nowhere to run.

1430
01:22:14,308 --> 01:22:16,724
Don't worry, I'll make it quick.

1431
01:22:24,180 --> 01:22:27,321
See, that's the problem
with your generation.

1432
01:22:27,425 --> 01:22:29,013
You all think

1433
01:22:29,116 --> 01:22:32,948
that you're smarter than us.

1434
01:22:39,955 --> 01:22:41,991
You got that right.

1435
01:22:58,352 --> 01:23:01,493
And I'm not your
fucking sweetheart.

1436
01:23:05,118 --> 01:23:06,982
You're going down,
no matter what.

1437
01:23:10,606 --> 01:23:12,780
The truth is going to
come out eventually.

1438
01:23:12,884 --> 01:23:15,266
Oh, you are too
dumb to be my son.

1439
01:23:15,369 --> 01:23:20,064
You tell people what
they want to believe,

1440
01:23:20,167 --> 01:23:22,204
and you can get
away with murder.

1441
01:23:22,307 --> 01:23:24,516
You started the
fire, didn't you?

1442
01:23:26,587 --> 01:23:28,072
For the fucking insurance money.

1443
01:23:28,175 --> 01:23:29,280
Business was bad.

1444
01:23:29,383 --> 01:23:30,943
You were losing money,
weren't you, Dad?

1445
01:23:32,352 --> 01:23:35,838
You burnt down the factory!

1446
01:23:35,941 --> 01:23:38,013
Now I take it back.

1447
01:23:38,116 --> 01:23:41,050
You're not as dumb as I thought.

1448
01:23:41,154 --> 01:23:43,190
Oh, fuck you.

1449
01:23:46,228 --> 01:23:48,471
I'll see you in hell, son.

1450
01:23:59,482 --> 01:24:02,520
Cole! Cole!

1451
01:24:02,623 --> 01:24:03,831
Oh, my God!

1452
01:24:04,970 --> 01:24:07,318
Stay there! Stay there!

1453
01:24:08,905 --> 01:24:10,631
Cole! Help!

1454
01:24:23,851 --> 01:24:25,750
Rust.

1455
01:24:25,853 --> 01:24:27,269
Cole!

1456
01:24:31,307 --> 01:24:32,412
You're alive, man.

1457
01:24:37,486 --> 01:24:38,314
See?

1458
01:24:38,418 --> 01:24:39,543
You always second-guess, man.

1459
01:24:39,626 --> 01:24:42,318
No, it's because you
smell like burnt flesh.

1460
01:24:42,422 --> 01:24:44,700
You don't smell so good either.

1461
01:24:44,803 --> 01:24:46,219
Oh, fuck it.

1462
01:24:54,192 --> 01:24:57,333
Such a confusing fucking night.

1463
01:24:57,437 --> 01:24:58,748
Quinn!

1464
01:24:58,852 --> 01:25:00,267
-Dad!
-Oh, Quinn.

1465
01:25:00,371 --> 01:25:01,441
Quinn, oh, my God.
-Dad.

1466
01:25:01,544 --> 01:25:03,891
Oh, thank god you're okay.

1467
01:25:03,995 --> 01:25:06,135
Are you... are you okay?

1468
01:25:06,239 --> 01:25:07,895
No, yeah, it's fine.

1469
01:25:07,999 --> 01:25:08,931
He just shot me once,

1470
01:25:09,034 --> 01:25:10,229
but it was on the
spleen side, so...

1471
01:25:10,312 --> 01:25:12,452
Oh, my god, that looks
really fucking bad.

1472
01:25:12,555 --> 01:25:15,627
No, it's okay. Hey, hey...

1473
01:25:15,731 --> 01:25:16,490
Promise me we'll learn

1474
01:25:16,594 --> 01:25:18,182
to talk things
through a bit better.

1475
01:25:19,459 --> 01:25:21,254
Yeah, I would like
that very much.

1476
01:25:27,329 --> 01:25:29,089
Okay, let's get out of here.

1477
01:25:29,193 --> 01:25:30,573
Okay, you don't have to...

1478
01:25:30,677 --> 01:25:31,816
Okay, okay, I'll be fine.

1479
01:25:31,919 --> 01:25:34,301
Come on. Come on...

1480
01:25:37,960 --> 01:25:40,618
So, what do you guys think
of Kettle Springs so far?

1481
01:25:40,721 --> 01:25:43,172
Uh... well, I haven't
really been here very long,

1482
01:25:43,276 --> 01:25:45,243
but I hear it's fucking
lovely in the spring.

1483
01:25:45,347 --> 01:25:46,796
-Quinn.
-Oh, sorry, Dad.

1484
01:25:46,900 --> 01:25:47,900
Language.

1485
01:25:49,627 --> 01:25:50,869
Guys?

1486
01:25:50,973 --> 01:25:52,147
Oh, shit.

1487
01:25:52,250 --> 01:25:53,375
Let's get the fuck out of here.

1488
01:25:53,458 --> 01:25:54,458
Yes.

1489
01:25:55,736 --> 01:25:56,530
There are keys.

1490
01:25:56,634 --> 01:25:58,912
Quick, get in!

1491
01:26:01,501 --> 01:26:03,537
Here we go. All right.

1492
01:26:07,127 --> 01:26:08,991
Shit.

1493
01:26:09,094 --> 01:26:11,545
Shit! It's another
stick shift, Dad.

1494
01:26:11,649 --> 01:26:12,546
I can't do it!

1495
01:26:12,650 --> 01:26:13,775
I can't do it.
Please take over...

1496
01:26:13,858 --> 01:26:14,790
Quinn, Quinn,

1497
01:26:14,893 --> 01:26:15,998
you got this.

1498
01:26:16,101 --> 01:26:17,724
Just here, just
push in the clutch.

1499
01:26:17,827 --> 01:26:18,827
It's that guy over there.

1500
01:26:20,313 --> 01:26:22,384
Slide it into first,

1501
01:26:22,487 --> 01:26:26,250
and give it a little bit of gas.

1502
01:26:26,353 --> 01:26:27,458
Oh, yup, there we go.

1503
01:26:27,561 --> 01:26:29,460
Okay, good, good. Now
let it out a little bit.

1504
01:26:32,670 --> 01:26:33,981
There you go. You're doing it.

1505
01:26:34,085 --> 01:26:35,155
Yeah, nice job, Quinn.

1506
01:26:35,259 --> 01:26:36,259
Guys, we got a problem!

1507
01:26:40,954 --> 01:26:43,957
We gotta go the other way.

1508
01:26:44,060 --> 01:26:45,510
No, we're done running.

1509
01:26:45,614 --> 01:26:47,374

01:26:47,478 --> 01:26:48,513
