1
00:00:38,973 --> 00:00:43,477
Mommy is...
stretchable.

2
00:00:44,111 --> 00:00:46,146
What do you mean
by stretchable?

3
00:00:46,246 --> 00:00:48,750
Daddy's hard.
You can't move him.

4
00:00:48,850 --> 00:00:51,218
He gets mad, and that's it.

5
00:00:52,754 --> 00:00:54,288
Mommy gets mad too,

6
00:00:54,388 --> 00:00:56,758
but she's more like putty.

7
00:00:56,858 --> 00:00:58,392
Mm.

8
00:00:58,993 --> 00:01:00,895
And she gets sad too.

9
00:01:00,995 --> 00:01:05,265
That's when it's
the most stretch.

10
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,537
Putty, um... I wonder
how is it that you stretch her?

11
00:01:11,539 --> 00:01:13,106
You just--

12
00:01:13,206 --> 00:01:16,109
Can I...
Can I talk now? Please?

13
00:01:16,878 --> 00:01:17,979
Um...

14
00:01:18,078 --> 00:01:19,847
-Is it okay if Mommy talks?
-Yep.

15
00:01:19,948 --> 00:01:21,114
Okay.

16
00:01:21,381 --> 00:01:23,952
I'm not stretchable.
I'm not putty.

17
00:01:24,052 --> 00:01:24,953
Well, that's her
experience of you.

18
00:01:25,053 --> 00:01:26,453
That isn't true.

19
00:01:26,554 --> 00:01:28,656
I try very hard to be in
control of her and everything,

20
00:01:28,756 --> 00:01:32,492
but, um, may as well not even
be there at all.

21
00:01:32,594 --> 00:01:35,029
Well, perception
is reality, so--

22
00:01:35,128 --> 00:01:37,297
Also, I don't get sad.

23
00:01:38,231 --> 00:01:40,001
You seem sad right now.

24
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:41,569
You do seem sad right now.

25
00:01:41,669 --> 00:01:43,771
We're here to talk about
how to get you better.

26
00:01:43,871 --> 00:01:46,139
All we do is talk about me.

27
00:01:46,841 --> 00:01:49,476
I can be sad. I mean,
I'm allowed to be sad, right?

28
00:01:49,577 --> 00:01:50,979
Well, of course.

29
00:01:51,079 --> 00:01:54,114
But, um, you must know that
this is all tangled up together

30
00:01:54,214 --> 00:01:55,315
and you of all people
should know--

31
00:01:55,415 --> 00:01:57,719
I know. I know, but, um...

32
00:01:58,285 --> 00:02:01,589
this...
this isn't how things...

33
00:02:02,255 --> 00:02:04,692
...are gonna get better. Um...

34
00:02:05,225 --> 00:02:06,561
Mommy, please don't cry...

35
00:02:06,661 --> 00:02:07,729
No, no. I--

36
00:02:07,829 --> 00:02:09,097
-...because then I'll cry.
-Sweetie.

37
00:02:09,196 --> 00:02:11,398
-She...
-Sweetie, it's okay. It's okay.

38
00:02:13,467 --> 00:02:15,703
We want the tube removed. Now.

39
00:02:15,803 --> 00:02:17,471
-No, you can't kill me!
-And to do that, we need...

40
00:02:17,572 --> 00:02:19,574
No, she won't do what
she has to do

41
00:02:19,674 --> 00:02:22,242
because she knows
that she has this safety net.

42
00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:24,344
Things are not
stable enough right now to--

43
00:02:24,444 --> 00:02:26,413
It's clear that we have
different goals.

44
00:02:26,514 --> 00:02:28,916
You want her to get better
before the tube can be removed.

45
00:02:29,017 --> 00:02:30,785
I think the tube needs
to come out,

46
00:02:30,885 --> 00:02:32,954
and then she can get better.

47
00:02:33,054 --> 00:02:34,254
We all have
the same goal here.

48
00:02:36,057 --> 00:02:38,726
But what I'm learning
as we're talking all together

49
00:02:38,826 --> 00:02:42,897
is that you and I need to spend
some time, just the two of us,

50
00:02:42,997 --> 00:02:44,297
without her here...

51
00:02:45,767 --> 00:02:47,702
...to talk about some
serious issues.

52
00:02:49,037 --> 00:02:50,138
I'm gonna need you to

53
00:02:50,237 --> 00:02:51,873
restart the tube feedings
at night

54
00:02:51,973 --> 00:02:53,473
and I need you
to start doing...

55
00:02:55,475 --> 00:02:56,844
Did you get the kind
with no cheese?

56
00:02:56,944 --> 00:02:58,713
I can't explain this to you
every time, sweetie.

57
00:02:58,813 --> 00:03:01,415
They would just laugh at me
and say it's bread, okay?

58
00:03:01,949 --> 00:03:05,119
I'll take the cheese off
when we get home, of course.

59
00:03:05,218 --> 00:03:06,521
Is it the kind with the little

60
00:03:06,621 --> 00:03:08,089
green and black things
in the sauce?

61
00:03:08,188 --> 00:03:10,925
It's the same kind
we always get.

62
00:03:11,358 --> 00:03:13,161
That kind has the things
in the sauce.

63
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:15,295
I can't... I can't eat it.

64
00:03:15,395 --> 00:03:16,898
Like, can you scrape it off--

65
00:03:16,998 --> 00:03:19,133
Do you even want the tube out or
is it just me who wants it out?

66
00:03:19,232 --> 00:03:20,535
You have to be...

67
00:03:21,669 --> 00:03:22,670
Jesus.

68
00:03:25,139 --> 00:03:26,541
Oh, poo.

69
00:03:29,242 --> 00:03:31,546
Oh...

70
00:03:31,646 --> 00:03:34,414
You got your wish. No cheese.

71
00:03:34,515 --> 00:03:36,283
-Did you will that to happen?
-Yeah.

72
00:03:36,383 --> 00:03:38,086
Are you some kind of
witch or something?

73
00:03:41,254 --> 00:03:43,624
Hey, straight to the table.
Actually, no.

74
00:03:43,725 --> 00:03:45,159
Wash hands first,
and then straight to the table.

75
00:03:45,258 --> 00:03:47,095
I don't have to go
to the bathroom though.

76
00:03:47,195 --> 00:03:48,395
No one's making you
go to the bathroom.

77
00:03:48,495 --> 00:03:50,832
I'm just asking you
to wash your hands, please,

78
00:03:50,932 --> 00:03:52,265
like we always do.

79
00:03:54,135 --> 00:03:56,170
Is Daddy coming?
Where's Daddy?

80
00:03:56,269 --> 00:03:59,207
Uh, he said
maybe bedtime.

81
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:01,475
When does he go again?

82
00:04:01,576 --> 00:04:05,747
He just got back,
so... in a month?

83
00:04:06,781 --> 00:04:07,915
Mommy?

84
00:04:08,816 --> 00:04:09,717
Yeah.

85
00:04:09,817 --> 00:04:11,819
I did have to
go to the bathroom.

86
00:04:11,919 --> 00:04:13,654
Okay.

87
00:04:14,122 --> 00:04:15,857
This might take a while.

88
00:04:18,059 --> 00:04:18,960
Okay.

89
00:04:57,932 --> 00:04:58,833
Mommy?

90
00:04:59,901 --> 00:05:01,068
Yeah?

91
00:05:01,169 --> 00:05:03,370
The bathroom
has water in it.

92
00:05:05,472 --> 00:05:07,575
Okay, well, that's good.

93
00:05:08,475 --> 00:05:10,945
No, I mean on the floor.

94
00:05:12,412 --> 00:05:13,881
Come quickly!

95
00:05:17,285 --> 00:05:18,920
Are you coming?

96
00:05:19,352 --> 00:05:21,454
Mommy!

97
00:05:23,356 --> 00:05:25,626
Oh, my God. What?

98
00:05:25,993 --> 00:05:28,729
Why didn't you tell me
as soon as you came in here?

99
00:05:28,896 --> 00:05:30,497
I just noticed...

100
00:05:30,598 --> 00:05:34,202
because I had to go
to the bathroom so bad.

101
00:05:34,869 --> 00:05:37,605
I don't like how it
feels on my socks.

102
00:05:37,839 --> 00:05:40,575
Where's it coming from?
How deep is it?

103
00:05:41,242 --> 00:05:42,409
Are we gonna die?

104
00:05:42,510 --> 00:05:44,411
Is the house gonna
fall on top of us?

105
00:05:45,112 --> 00:05:46,346
Mommy?

106
00:05:46,446 --> 00:05:48,316
Can you lift me up
and carry me out?

107
00:05:48,415 --> 00:05:51,786
Yep, just
stay there, okay? Hold on.

108
00:05:51,886 --> 00:05:54,689
Mom, why are you leaving me?
Where are you going?

109
00:05:54,789 --> 00:05:56,190
Just please stay on the toilet,
okay?

110
00:05:56,290 --> 00:05:57,191
No.

111
00:05:58,693 --> 00:06:00,493
Can you please come...

112
00:06:00,595 --> 00:06:01,829
Can you come now?

113
00:06:01,929 --> 00:06:02,964
Oh, my...

114
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:06,734
Oh...

115
00:06:08,169 --> 00:06:09,604
...my fucking God.

116
00:06:09,704 --> 00:06:10,705
Mommy!

117
00:06:10,805 --> 00:06:13,674
Mommy, you're not
telling me what it is!

118
00:06:14,275 --> 00:06:15,776
Mommy!

119
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:21,115
-What's going on?
-What?

120
00:06:22,149 --> 00:06:23,584
What's happening, Mom?

121
00:06:24,484 --> 00:06:25,786
Are we gonna die?

122
00:06:30,224 --> 00:06:31,525
<i>-Hey.</i>
-Hey, yeah.

123
00:06:31,626 --> 00:06:33,728
We just got home,
and you would not believe--

124
00:06:38,099 --> 00:06:40,400
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

125
00:06:44,672 --> 00:06:47,074
No, no, no! Do not come here.

126
00:06:47,174 --> 00:06:48,609
Do not come in here!

127
00:06:48,709 --> 00:06:51,946
Right now, go, go, go!
Right now! Right now!

128
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:55,082
Go, go, go, go!

129
00:06:55,182 --> 00:06:58,019
Go! Oh, my God!

130
00:08:16,397 --> 00:08:19,033
<i>Nothing is familiar</i>
<i>or real.</i>

131
00:08:19,133 --> 00:08:20,434
<i>Ever.</i>

132
00:08:20,534 --> 00:08:23,337
<i>Every time I feel this way</i>
<i>I get further and further away</i>

133
00:08:23,437 --> 00:08:26,674
<i>from being in myself, and,</i>
<i>like, I can never get back.</i>

134
00:08:27,908 --> 00:08:30,111
<i>When you think about time,</i>

135
00:08:30,211 --> 00:08:31,812
<i>how do you see it?</i>

136
00:08:32,246 --> 00:08:33,748
<i>How do I see time?</i>

137
00:08:33,848 --> 00:08:35,416
<i>Um...</i>

138
00:08:35,516 --> 00:08:38,953
<i>Time is a series of things</i>
<i>to get through.</i>

139
00:08:39,286 --> 00:08:41,022
<i>Each goal is a cliff.</i>

140
00:08:41,122 --> 00:08:43,324
<i>There's nothing</i>

141
00:08:43,724 --> 00:08:47,695

142
00:08:48,896 --> 00:08:51,632
<i>I'm so mad at you!</i>

143
00:10:38,038 --> 00:10:39,140
Oh, shit.

144
00:10:41,108 --> 00:10:42,611
Yo, you know about
holotropic breathing?

145
00:10:42,710 --> 00:10:43,711
Mm-mm.

146
00:10:43,811 --> 00:10:45,212
Yo, this shit is lit.

147
00:10:45,312 --> 00:10:47,848
Basically, you trick your brain
into thinking it's dead,

148
00:10:47,948 --> 00:10:50,151
and you see
the fucking universe.

149
00:10:50,251 --> 00:10:51,485
You know what I'm saying?

150
00:10:51,586 --> 00:10:53,687
So you won't feel paranoia
and guilt if something's wrong.

151
00:10:55,289 --> 00:10:57,992
I've got a friend who
does Reiki and shit like that.

152
00:10:58,092 --> 00:11:01,061
Nah, see what I'm saying?
This is like hyperventilating.

153
00:11:01,162 --> 00:11:03,264
When you die, they say
you let off this chemical.

154
00:11:03,364 --> 00:11:06,100
And when you're dreaming,
you let off the same chemical.

155
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:07,935
It's sort of like that,
you know?

156
00:11:08,035 --> 00:11:09,737
You make your brain
think it's dead,

157
00:11:09,837 --> 00:11:13,307
but being brain-dead
is still alive.

158
00:11:13,707 --> 00:11:15,644
-Holographic breathwork?
-Holotropic.

159
00:11:15,743 --> 00:11:17,344
Tropic. Holotropic.

160
00:11:22,983 --> 00:11:25,419
-Is that real?
-What?

161
00:11:26,020 --> 00:11:28,956
-The... the dead brain thing?
-Oh, yeah.

162
00:11:29,056 --> 00:11:32,860
I mean, shit.
I guess anything could be real.

163
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:35,162
I mean, anything
could be bullshit too.

164
00:11:35,262 --> 00:11:36,531
You know what I'm saying?

165
00:11:38,766 --> 00:11:43,337
But you know that feeling
like when you're not...

166
00:11:47,609 --> 00:11:48,909
Yeah.

167
00:11:54,081 --> 00:11:55,849
Oh, you're making fun of me.

168
00:11:55,950 --> 00:11:57,952
-Miss, I don't even know you.
-Right.

169
00:11:58,052 --> 00:12:01,188
Okay. Um, yes on these,
but no on the wine.

170
00:12:02,557 --> 00:12:03,724
Why?

171
00:12:06,227 --> 00:12:08,929
The law prohibits me from
selling you this wine right now.

172
00:12:10,599 --> 00:12:11,865
But it isn't even 2:00.

173
00:12:12,466 --> 00:12:14,068
It's 1:58.

174
00:12:15,736 --> 00:12:17,104
Right, but--

175
00:12:17,204 --> 00:12:19,373
By the time I ring these up,
it will be past two.

176
00:12:20,407 --> 00:12:22,376
Huh. Um...

177
00:12:24,679 --> 00:12:26,514
I'll just get
the peanut butter cups.

178
00:12:26,615 --> 00:12:27,948
You can put them on my room.

179
00:12:28,315 --> 00:12:29,517
Will do.

180
00:13:10,725 --> 00:13:11,959
I can't talk
about this anymore.

181
00:13:12,059 --> 00:13:14,028
I'm telling you. Please.

182
00:13:14,128 --> 00:13:16,897
<i>Hey, hey. Look, if that's</i>
<i>what Dr. Spring thinks is best,</i>

183
00:13:16,997 --> 00:13:17,965
<i>then we have to listen</i>
<i>to Dr. Spring.</i>

184
00:13:18,065 --> 00:13:18,999
There is no "we" though.

185
00:13:19,099 --> 00:13:20,602
It's just me. I... I'm...

186
00:13:20,702 --> 00:13:22,803
-It's not fair. I'm telling you.
<i>-Whoa!</i>

187
00:13:22,903 --> 00:13:25,372
<i>Fair? Listen,</i>
<i>I'm working, all right?</i>

188
00:13:25,472 --> 00:13:28,008
<i>I'm dealing with a lot of</i>
<i>assholes. You have no idea.</i>

189
00:13:28,108 --> 00:13:29,910
<i>And I cannot do anything about</i>

190
00:13:30,010 --> 00:13:32,246
<i>what's going on there</i>
<i>from here.</i>

191
00:13:32,346 --> 00:13:35,049
<i>We need to be a team.</i>
<i>You have to go there today</i>

192
00:13:35,149 --> 00:13:37,719
<i>and check in and let them know</i>

193
00:13:37,818 --> 00:13:39,320
<i>-that this whole thing is not--</i>
-I know. I know.

194
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:40,722
The problem with that logic,
though,

195
00:13:40,821 --> 00:13:41,855
is that I'm not a housewife.

196
00:13:41,955 --> 00:13:43,457
-I work too.
<i>-Whoa, whoa, whoa.</i>

197
00:13:44,693 --> 00:13:47,094
Mommy,
this hotel food is gross.

198
00:13:47,194 --> 00:13:49,496
-Good morning.
-This is disgusting.

199
00:13:50,264 --> 00:13:51,666
Wow.

200
00:13:51,766 --> 00:13:54,602
You guys look just like twins.
Anybody ever tell you that?

201
00:13:54,703 --> 00:13:55,969
Uh, no.
You're the first person

202
00:13:56,070 --> 00:13:57,706
to notice and/or say that.

203
00:13:57,806 --> 00:13:58,906
Everyone says that.

204
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:03,243
-Hey, cutie. Wanna see a trick?
-Yeah.

205
00:14:04,044 --> 00:14:06,313
Whoa. How'd you do that?

206
00:14:07,414 --> 00:14:09,183
Mommy?

207
00:14:09,883 --> 00:14:11,885
You should take it.
She's never gonna eat it.

208
00:14:14,455 --> 00:14:15,356
Okay.

209
00:14:16,156 --> 00:14:17,991
Am I gonna throw up now?

210
00:14:20,729 --> 00:14:22,229
-Yeah?
<i>-You hung up on me.</i>

211
00:14:22,329 --> 00:14:25,065
<i>Look, I know you have</i>
<i>a lot on your plate,</i>

212
00:14:25,165 --> 00:14:26,801
<i>but she's getting better,</i>

213
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:28,936
<i>and the rest of it</i>
<i>is totally temporary.</i>

214
00:14:29,036 --> 00:14:31,372
<i>The ceiling will get fixed,</i>
<i>I promise.</i>

215
00:14:31,472 --> 00:14:34,074
<i>The sky is not falling.</i>
<i>None of this is your fault.</i>

216
00:14:34,174 --> 00:14:35,976
<i>-I love you.</i>
-I'm sorry. I love you too.

217
00:14:36,076 --> 00:14:37,378
<i>What's so bad about</i>
<i>a hotel anyway?</i>

218
00:14:37,478 --> 00:14:39,614
<i>And while you're there,</i>
<i>take advantage of the pool.</i>

219
00:14:39,714 --> 00:14:41,315
<i>They got a pool, right?</i>

220
00:14:41,516 --> 00:14:43,083
<i>You always said you wish</i>
<i>you had a pool,</i>

221
00:14:43,183 --> 00:14:44,619
<i>so now you have one.</i>

222
00:14:44,719 --> 00:14:47,187
<i>Why don't you go? You can</i>
<i>do some laps, lounge a little.</i>

223
00:14:47,287 --> 00:14:49,356
<i>Get a floatie. Kick back,</i>
<i>get a couple of margarita...</i>

224
00:14:49,456 --> 00:14:50,491
Okay.

225
00:14:50,792 --> 00:14:53,927
Did you know that you can
train hamsters to love you?

226
00:14:54,596 --> 00:14:55,563
No.

227
00:14:55,663 --> 00:14:57,832
You can train them to love you.

228
00:14:58,232 --> 00:15:01,368
Well, I would love if you would
finish your bacon.

229
00:15:01,468 --> 00:15:04,706
That way I can tell everybody
you got 100% on breakfast.

230
00:15:04,806 --> 00:15:08,643
And once they love you, you can
get them to do everything

231
00:15:08,743 --> 00:15:10,978
including tricks.

232
00:15:11,646 --> 00:15:13,313
Let's start with one bite.

233
00:15:14,616 --> 00:15:16,718
<i>♪ Ring, ding</i>
<i>Ring-a-ring-a-ling-dang ♪</i>

234
00:15:16,818 --> 00:15:18,952
<i>♪ Ring-a-ling-a-ding-dang-do ♪</i>

235
00:15:19,052 --> 00:15:21,021
<i>♪ Ring, ling</i>
<i>Ring-a-ling-a-ding-dang... ♪</i>

236
00:15:21,121 --> 00:15:22,923
<i>♪ Keeps him from lovin' you ♪</i>

237
00:15:35,269 --> 00:15:38,238
Is the parking guy gonna
get mad again?

238
00:15:39,507 --> 00:15:43,110
Double-park! Double-park!
Double-park!

239
00:15:43,210 --> 00:15:45,045
Okay.

240
00:15:45,145 --> 00:15:47,047
Gotta be fast. You know
what happened last time.

241
00:16:03,430 --> 00:16:06,433
You've missed the last few weeks
of family sessions.

242
00:16:07,769 --> 00:16:08,703
Yeah.

243
00:16:10,003 --> 00:16:11,405
I told you what happened.

244
00:16:11,506 --> 00:16:14,174
Our entire ceiling fell down,
and with all that chaos,

245
00:16:14,274 --> 00:16:16,343
and we're living out
of the hotel--

246
00:16:16,443 --> 00:16:18,746
So we need to schedule something
as soon as possible

247
00:16:18,847 --> 00:16:22,249
to talk about her goals
and the treatment process.

248
00:16:22,349 --> 00:16:23,885
Yeah. Yeah, okay. Yeah.

249
00:16:23,984 --> 00:16:26,420
Duh.

250
00:16:26,521 --> 00:16:27,421
Yeah.

251
00:16:29,022 --> 00:16:30,758
-Mm-hm.
-Mm-hm.

252
00:16:31,058 --> 00:16:33,528
Oh, you meant now?
Okay. All right.

253
00:16:33,628 --> 00:16:34,929
Um...

254
00:16:35,028 --> 00:16:38,165
Well, uh, let me look
at my schedule.

255
00:16:38,265 --> 00:16:39,767
I should probably do that...

256
00:16:39,868 --> 00:16:41,569
I know that you already
know this,

257
00:16:41,936 --> 00:16:45,940
but you can't start letting
feelings of guilt and control

258
00:16:46,039 --> 00:16:49,276
about this illness
and treatment affect you.

259
00:16:50,578 --> 00:16:51,613
It's no one's fault.

260
00:16:51,713 --> 00:16:53,681
That's right.
That's what I keep hearing.

261
00:16:53,781 --> 00:16:57,351
Also, I really need you to
start taking care of yourself.

262
00:16:57,451 --> 00:16:58,352
Right. Yes.

263
00:16:58,452 --> 00:17:00,922
No.
Put my oxygen mask on first.

264
00:17:01,021 --> 00:17:02,155
Mm-hm, mm-hm.

265
00:17:02,256 --> 00:17:03,625
I'm just gonna have
to get blunt here.

266
00:17:03,725 --> 00:17:08,262
So she needs to reach her
weight goal in the next week.

267
00:17:08,696 --> 00:17:12,000
If she does that,
then we can put tube removal

268
00:17:12,099 --> 00:17:13,902
and discharge dates
on the books

269
00:17:14,002 --> 00:17:15,637
but if she doesn't do that,

270
00:17:15,737 --> 00:17:18,305
I'm gonna have to reassess
the level of care

271
00:17:18,405 --> 00:17:20,608
because obviously something
is not working here,

272
00:17:20,708 --> 00:17:22,744
and this is what
I need to talk to you about.

273
00:17:22,844 --> 00:17:25,078
When can we sit down properly?

274
00:17:25,178 --> 00:17:27,515
Yeah, fine. Uh, September 7th.

275
00:17:27,615 --> 00:17:29,651
It's September 15th.

276
00:17:31,118 --> 00:17:34,187
September 20.
I mean, September...

277
00:17:34,856 --> 00:17:36,156
September 20.

278
00:17:38,826 --> 00:17:39,761
Hey!

279
00:17:43,196 --> 00:17:45,499
Hey! I told you not to do that,
and the next time

280
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:47,035
I will report you
to the building.

281
00:17:47,134 --> 00:17:48,603
You have no authority
to report me.

282
00:17:48,703 --> 00:17:50,137
You won't be allowed in the lot.
I'll have you towed!

283
00:17:50,237 --> 00:17:51,706
Oh, sure! Call them!

284
00:17:51,806 --> 00:17:53,073
I'm not in there long enough

285
00:17:53,173 --> 00:17:54,642
for them to even come!

286
00:17:54,842 --> 00:17:56,343
Whatever!

287
00:17:56,443 --> 00:17:57,512
Asshole.

288
00:18:00,180 --> 00:18:01,849
The apartment is
a 30-minute walk,

289
00:18:01,950 --> 00:18:03,551
but it might as well be on Mars.

290
00:18:03,651 --> 00:18:04,886
And I just, I can't...

291
00:18:04,986 --> 00:18:07,055
Every time I go check,
it looks worse,

292
00:18:07,154 --> 00:18:09,489
and I... I have no control.

293
00:18:09,591 --> 00:18:11,224
Have you tried
discussing a compromise

294
00:18:11,325 --> 00:18:12,492
with your landlord?

295
00:18:12,794 --> 00:18:16,163
Perhaps they could section off
the room with the hole,

296
00:18:16,463 --> 00:18:19,232
then you could live freely
in the rest of the apartment.

297
00:18:19,333 --> 00:18:22,202
Live freely with asbestos

298
00:18:22,302 --> 00:18:25,740
and 100-year-old dust
and black mold spores?

299
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:27,274
That's your advice?

300
00:18:27,374 --> 00:18:30,545
It's not advice.
It's a question to consider.

301
00:18:30,645 --> 00:18:33,815
I should really show
you this hole.

302
00:18:34,181 --> 00:18:38,586
It's an entire nightmare
on my ceiling.

303
00:18:39,854 --> 00:18:41,789
When does Charles return?

304
00:18:41,990 --> 00:18:44,659
This is week three of eight.

305
00:18:44,759 --> 00:18:48,328
I mean, you should know that.
Don't you write things down?

306
00:18:48,428 --> 00:18:49,496
It's your job to remember

307
00:18:49,597 --> 00:18:51,866
the boring details
of my fucking life.

308
00:18:52,399 --> 00:18:54,535
We do have to stop now.
We are out of time.

309
00:18:54,636 --> 00:18:56,436
I have another
patient coming, so...

310
00:18:56,537 --> 00:18:57,404
Wait, now?

311
00:18:57,505 --> 00:18:58,973
What about the
ten-minute warning?

312
00:18:59,073 --> 00:19:01,075
Yeah, I just wasn't
paying attention.

313
00:19:01,174 --> 00:19:03,511
You didn't respond to the email
that I sent you about my dream.

314
00:19:03,611 --> 00:19:07,081
I don't respond
to my client's dream emails.

315
00:19:07,180 --> 00:19:10,417
Okay. So, if you
don't bring it up,

316
00:19:10,518 --> 00:19:12,419
then what is the point?

317
00:19:14,154 --> 00:19:16,390
Okay. Uh, you got me.

318
00:19:16,490 --> 00:19:19,159
I had a dream, and I need
to talk about it today,

319
00:19:19,259 --> 00:19:20,962
and I didn't get any time

320
00:19:21,062 --> 00:19:23,230
because you didn't
give me a warning.

321
00:19:23,497 --> 00:19:27,669
We can discuss the dream
you emailed next session.

322
00:19:27,769 --> 00:19:29,637
Well, it's actually
a different dream.

323
00:19:29,737 --> 00:19:31,773
-Well, I don't really--
-About you.

324
00:19:35,375 --> 00:19:37,111
-Okay, quickly.
-Okay.

325
00:19:37,210 --> 00:19:40,081
I was in a hospital day room

326
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:42,150
or a recreation room
or something,

327
00:19:42,249 --> 00:19:44,351
and I knew my daughter
was also in the hospital

328
00:19:44,451 --> 00:19:47,655
but... but far away,
another part,

329
00:19:47,755 --> 00:19:50,223
and it didn't look like
the hospital

330
00:19:50,323 --> 00:19:51,859
she was in last year, though,

331
00:19:51,959 --> 00:19:54,294
when everything happened.
It was different. It was weird.

332
00:19:54,394 --> 00:19:56,329
And I was waiting for Charles
to come get me,

333
00:19:56,430 --> 00:19:57,799
so we could pick her up

334
00:19:57,899 --> 00:20:00,101
but instead, you were there,

335
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:01,703
and you wanted to sit
really close to me.

336
00:20:03,037 --> 00:20:05,173
And I was, like, inching away
from you on the bench

337
00:20:05,272 --> 00:20:07,542
and you kept inching closer.

338
00:20:07,642 --> 00:20:09,844
And I got my phone
out to text Charles

339
00:20:09,944 --> 00:20:12,013
'cause I was nervous he'd
come in and he'd see

340
00:20:12,113 --> 00:20:15,282
and then you tried
to grab the phone

341
00:20:15,382 --> 00:20:18,720
and then you started
to tickle me...

342
00:20:18,820 --> 00:20:20,420
...to try to get me to drop it,

343
00:20:20,521 --> 00:20:23,290
and I was, like...

344
00:20:23,390 --> 00:20:24,859
I was really enjoying it,

345
00:20:24,959 --> 00:20:28,162
but I was so scared that Charles
would come in and he would see.

346
00:20:30,898 --> 00:20:32,332
All right.

347
00:20:35,903 --> 00:20:37,138
Okay?

348
00:20:37,404 --> 00:20:39,406
All right. You got to tell me.

349
00:20:39,507 --> 00:20:41,308
We'll talk about it next time.

350
00:20:41,943 --> 00:20:43,177
Okay?

351
00:20:43,276 --> 00:20:46,013
We won't
talk about it next time.

352
00:20:46,313 --> 00:20:48,015
You know that.

353
00:20:48,716 --> 00:20:51,786
There's no thread.
There's no thread at all.

354
00:21:08,268 --> 00:21:10,303
Yes?
What now?

355
00:21:10,403 --> 00:21:12,339
<i>Hi, yes. So sorry.</i>

356
00:21:12,439 --> 00:21:14,274
<i>Have to leave. Stop work.</i>

357
00:21:14,374 --> 00:21:15,676
Uh, what?

358
00:21:16,043 --> 00:21:19,279
<i>Mother died. I have to leave.</i>
<i>Work is going to take longer.</i>

359
00:21:19,379 --> 00:21:21,582
Uh, okay, uh, just--

360
00:21:21,682 --> 00:21:23,017
I'll be one second.

361
00:21:26,888 --> 00:21:29,123
Okay, what is the issue then?
Can you tell me?

362
00:21:29,223 --> 00:21:30,224
This has been going on
for so long.

363
00:21:30,323 --> 00:21:31,259
Do I need to get
a new contractor?

364
00:21:31,358 --> 00:21:32,894
<i>It spread.</i>

365
00:21:32,994 --> 00:21:34,996
<i>Uh, it's full. It's very full,</i>
<i>you understand? Very full.</i>

366
00:21:35,096 --> 00:21:36,264
It spread?

367
00:21:36,363 --> 00:21:37,932
<i>Not easy to explain.</i>
<i>Not my language.</i>

368
00:21:38,032 --> 00:21:40,968
<i>¡Yo hablo español! Explícame</i>
<i>en tu idioma, ¡lo entenderé!</i>

369
00:21:41,068 --> 00:21:43,504
<i>Sorry, but I don't</i>
<i>understand those words.</i>

370
00:21:43,604 --> 00:21:45,239
How long will you be grieving
for your mother?

371
00:21:45,338 --> 00:21:47,675
<i>I don't say. I don't know.</i>
<i>I can't say.</i>

372
00:21:47,775 --> 00:21:49,977
Look, I need a date, okay?
It needs to be fixed.

373
00:21:50,077 --> 00:21:52,580
Just give me a date. My husband
and I will be returning to--

374
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:55,116
<i>I'll be back, one week.</i>

375
00:21:55,716 --> 00:21:57,484
Okay, well, fine.
I'm going to be going there

376
00:21:57,585 --> 00:21:58,953
and checking on
what you have done so far,

377
00:21:59,053 --> 00:22:00,688
and I'm going to be
taking pictures, and I--

378
00:22:06,326 --> 00:22:08,763
<i>Vete a la mierda, el cabrón.</i>

379
00:22:22,210 --> 00:22:23,744
I can see you now.

380
00:22:42,663 --> 00:22:45,465
I'm really happy to hold this
silent space for you but...

381
00:22:46,567 --> 00:22:47,835
...as usual, I am curious as to

382
00:22:47,935 --> 00:22:49,704
what you might be
thinking about.

383
00:22:53,007 --> 00:22:54,075
Riley.

384
00:22:55,442 --> 00:22:57,545
That's all I can think about.

385
00:23:00,982 --> 00:23:02,583
Tell me what's going on.

386
00:23:03,117 --> 00:23:04,218
Well, I...

387
00:23:04,318 --> 00:23:06,754
I keep telling you, it's--

388
00:23:06,854 --> 00:23:09,123
It's like I keep saying
to his doctor, he--

389
00:23:09,223 --> 00:23:11,292
He doesn't smile. He--

390
00:23:11,659 --> 00:23:12,960
He looks at me weirdly,

391
00:23:13,060 --> 00:23:16,998
and he's just very
uncomfortable all of the time,

392
00:23:17,098 --> 00:23:19,767
and... and no one will do
anything about it.

393
00:23:22,370 --> 00:23:23,537
You know what I would love

394
00:23:23,638 --> 00:23:25,438
and what I think would be
extremely helpful

395
00:23:25,539 --> 00:23:28,042
is if you could come
to a session without Riley.

396
00:23:28,242 --> 00:23:29,442
I think it would be...

397
00:23:29,543 --> 00:23:31,045
-I know you think you can't--
-No, I can't.

398
00:23:31,145 --> 00:23:33,748
But I think if you got a sitter
who you trusted, who you could--

399
00:23:33,848 --> 00:23:37,318
Did you hear about that nanny
in New York?

400
00:23:37,685 --> 00:23:39,086
The mom came home from work,

401
00:23:39,186 --> 00:23:40,521
and the nanny had stabbed

402
00:23:40,621 --> 00:23:43,157
both of her kids to death
in the bathtub.

403
00:23:44,292 --> 00:23:47,460
That is real. That happened.

404
00:23:47,728 --> 00:23:52,300
A situation like that is
very, very, very unusual, okay?

405
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:53,834
Most people have caregivers

406
00:23:53,935 --> 00:23:55,903
-who can trust that...
-I can't.

407
00:23:56,904 --> 00:23:58,806
Well, I... I believe you can.

408
00:23:58,906 --> 00:24:00,841
I just think you don't want to
or you're afraid

409
00:24:00,942 --> 00:24:02,475
so let's stick
to some practical--

410
00:24:02,576 --> 00:24:04,211
I need to protect him.

411
00:24:05,546 --> 00:24:07,715
From something specific?

412
00:24:07,815 --> 00:24:10,818
Because something
very bad is happening.

413
00:24:14,255 --> 00:24:16,991
I'm so... Can I just--
One second. I just have to...

414
00:24:17,091 --> 00:24:20,761
This could be about my daughter.
I'm... I'm so sorry.

415
00:24:26,901 --> 00:24:27,969
Um...

416
00:24:29,203 --> 00:24:32,807
Yeah. Look, look, I--
I'm not Riley's doctor

417
00:24:32,907 --> 00:24:36,243
so I can't speak to what may
or may not be going on with him.

418
00:24:36,344 --> 00:24:39,013
We can only talk
about your feelings

419
00:24:39,113 --> 00:24:41,849
about what you perceive
is going on with Riley,

420
00:24:41,949 --> 00:24:44,018
which is why I do believe
medication can be--

421
00:24:44,118 --> 00:24:45,953
I'm not perceiving it.

422
00:24:46,053 --> 00:24:47,955
It is happening.

423
00:24:48,322 --> 00:24:51,058
And I feel awful about it.

424
00:24:52,593 --> 00:24:54,462
Okay, listen.

425
00:24:55,029 --> 00:24:57,497
When you're having
these feelings of deep panic

426
00:24:57,598 --> 00:24:59,333
at home with Riley,

427
00:24:59,734 --> 00:25:03,137
just put him in his crib or
carrier or somewhere safe...

428
00:25:04,271 --> 00:25:06,440
...and draw a bath.

429
00:25:07,074 --> 00:25:10,611
Just breathe until your
heart isn't racing anymore,

430
00:25:11,278 --> 00:25:13,347
come out and get dressed,

431
00:25:13,447 --> 00:25:15,549
start the day over again...

432
00:25:16,650 --> 00:25:18,753
...put on some real clothes.

433
00:25:20,788 --> 00:25:22,790
These feelings that
you're experiencing

434
00:25:22,890 --> 00:25:26,560
they are...
they're very, very, very scary.

435
00:25:29,296 --> 00:25:31,599
Okay? And very dark.

436
00:25:31,699 --> 00:25:33,901
And that's why
you need to keep moving.

437
00:25:34,702 --> 00:25:36,670
You need to keep going.

438
00:25:36,771 --> 00:25:38,507
You need to be busy.

439
00:25:38,939 --> 00:25:41,809
You can't sit inside the fear

440
00:25:41,909 --> 00:25:43,377
and doubt

441
00:25:43,477 --> 00:25:45,112
and scariness.

442
00:25:52,353 --> 00:25:55,524
<i>Breathwork is a deep healing</i>
<i>in the nervous system,</i>

443
00:25:55,623 --> 00:25:59,260
<i>where we hold trauma</i>
<i>and trapped emotions.</i>

444
00:25:59,493 --> 00:26:02,496
<i>We can't talk our way</i>
<i>out of trauma.</i>

445
00:26:02,596 --> 00:26:04,398
<i>The body needs to process</i>

446
00:26:04,498 --> 00:26:07,168
<i>unprocessed emotions</i>
<i>within the body.</i>

447
00:26:07,268 --> 00:26:09,804
<i>And this is why breathwork</i>
<i>is so powerful.</i>

448
00:26:09,904 --> 00:26:12,373
<i>If you're looking for deeper</i>
<i>ways of healing</i>

449
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:14,842
<i>and you're searching</i>
<i>for alternatives,</i>

450
00:26:14,942 --> 00:26:16,410
<i>don't wait any longer.</i>

451
00:26:16,511 --> 00:26:19,880
<i>Let's connect and schedule</i>
<i>your first breathwork session.</i>

452
00:26:20,515 --> 00:26:23,017
<i>Directly before the</i>
<i>judge read Ortega her sentence,</i>

453
00:26:23,117 --> 00:26:25,486
<i>she begged for forgiveness</i>
<i>for her unspeakable crime.</i>

454
00:26:25,586 --> 00:26:26,854
<i>She stated she was sorry</i>

455
00:26:26,954 --> 00:26:28,956
<i>for what the judge had called,</i>
<i>"Pure evil."</i>

456
00:26:29,156 --> 00:26:31,392
<i>She then spoke about how</i>
<i>untreated mental illness...</i>

457
00:26:31,492 --> 00:26:32,660
Fuck.

458
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:33,828
<i>-The judge was not convinced.</i>
-Shit.

459
00:26:33,928 --> 00:26:35,229
<i>She will be serving life</i>
<i>in prison</i>

460
00:26:35,329 --> 00:26:37,231
<i>with no possibility of parole,</i>
<i>saying that--</i>

461
00:26:44,839 --> 00:26:47,808
You would not believe
what I have been through today.

462
00:26:48,142 --> 00:26:51,011
Okay, so, I don't
know if you recall

463
00:26:51,112 --> 00:26:53,948
but there was this pair of
absolutely davoon-ianca,

464
00:26:54,048 --> 00:26:55,349
davoon, gorge leather gloves

465
00:26:55,449 --> 00:26:56,851
that I saw on The RealReal.

466
00:26:56,951 --> 00:26:59,521
I wake up this morning, banned.

467
00:26:59,887 --> 00:27:02,623
Banned. Yeah. I know.

468
00:27:02,723 --> 00:27:03,691
<i>Hey, my love!</i>

469
00:27:03,791 --> 00:27:04,992
<i>So you been keeping up</i>

470
00:27:05,092 --> 00:27:06,561
<i>and eating,</i>
<i>and doing all the right things?</i>

471
00:27:06,660 --> 00:27:08,329
Yeah, I ate
some cheese today!

472
00:27:08,429 --> 00:27:09,564
-Mmm.
<i>-Cheese!</i>

473
00:27:09,663 --> 00:27:10,631
<i>That's fantastic.</i>
<i>I love cheese!</i>

474
00:27:10,731 --> 00:27:12,032
-Daddy, can I get a hamster?
-No.

475
00:27:12,133 --> 00:27:13,501
I already told you,
you're not getting a hamster.

476
00:27:13,602 --> 00:27:14,802
<i>No, no. You know what,</i>
<i>let's see, okay?</i>

477
00:27:14,902 --> 00:27:16,137
<i>Maybe when we get</i>
<i>back to the apartment...</i>

478
00:27:16,237 --> 00:27:17,539
No, no, no, no, no.
She's not getting a hamster.

479
00:27:17,638 --> 00:27:18,573
Daddy,
when are you coming home?

480
00:27:18,672 --> 00:27:19,907
She's not getting a hamster.

481
00:27:20,007 --> 00:27:22,009
What, where are you?
I can hear something weird.

482
00:27:22,109 --> 00:27:24,912
<i>Oh. Yeah, that.</i>
<i>I'm catching a game.</i>

483
00:27:25,279 --> 00:27:26,413
-A game?
<i>-Yeah.</i>

484
00:27:26,515 --> 00:27:27,915
<i>Yeah, we got here this morning,</i>

485
00:27:28,015 --> 00:27:29,450
<i>and there's a</i>
<i>minor league team here</i>

486
00:27:29,551 --> 00:27:32,219
<i>on the island where we go.</i>
<i>It's a little loud, so...</i>

487
00:27:32,319 --> 00:27:34,121
Oh, it must be nice, huh,
doing things for yourself.

488
00:27:34,221 --> 00:27:35,823
-What's that like?
<i>-Hey, hey, hey.</i>

489
00:27:35,923 --> 00:27:37,091
<i>You wanna switch places?</i>

490
00:27:37,191 --> 00:27:38,459
<i>You don't know</i>
<i>what I'm dealing with here.</i>

491
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:39,727
<i>All right,</i>
<i>I'll go sit on my ass...</i>

492
00:27:39,827 --> 00:27:41,395
-Daddy!
<i>-...all day in therapy...</i>

493
00:27:41,695 --> 00:27:43,164
<i>I'm sorry. Ha-ha.</i>

494
00:27:43,264 --> 00:27:45,966
<i>I mean, "sit on my butt"</i>
<i>listening to people whine,</i>

495
00:27:46,066 --> 00:27:47,968
<i>and you can captain this fu--</i>

496
00:27:48,068 --> 00:27:50,804
<i>Uh... this stupid boat, okay?</i>

497
00:27:50,905 --> 00:27:53,007
<i>Listen, I'm allowed</i>
<i>to do things on my time off.</i>

498
00:27:53,107 --> 00:27:56,310
<i>-Jesus Christ!</i>
-Time off? Oh, okay, um...

499
00:27:56,410 --> 00:27:58,547
Daddy has to go now,
and, uh, we have to drive,

500
00:27:58,647 --> 00:28:00,181
-so say goodbye to Daddy, okay?
<i>-No. I don't have to go!</i>

501
00:28:00,281 --> 00:28:02,016
<i>-Look, they're in the middle...</i>
-Jesus.

502
00:28:03,717 --> 00:28:06,053
I told you, it's a rodent,

503
00:28:06,153 --> 00:28:07,788
and just something
to look after for no reason.

504
00:28:07,888 --> 00:28:10,659
Please, please don't ask again,

505
00:28:10,758 --> 00:28:12,594
and don't ask Daddy things
I already say no to.

506
00:28:12,693 --> 00:28:15,296
But Mommy, it's not fair!

507
00:28:51,332 --> 00:28:53,867
Dr. Spring said this
is a big week.

508
00:28:54,168 --> 00:28:56,671
-Did she tell you that?
-Yeah.

509
00:28:56,770 --> 00:28:58,205
I think you can do it.

510
00:28:58,305 --> 00:29:00,808
But I'm already doing
it my best.

511
00:29:01,108 --> 00:29:03,477
I know, but you have
to do a little better

512
00:29:03,578 --> 00:29:05,079
then we can
get rid of this thing,

513
00:29:05,179 --> 00:29:06,947
and everything will be okay.

514
00:29:08,583 --> 00:29:09,883
I'll be better.

515
00:29:11,885 --> 00:29:13,354
Okay. Well...

516
00:29:15,789 --> 00:29:17,124
...it's not up to me.

517
00:29:17,224 --> 00:29:18,892
It's up to you.

518
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,335
What book can I read
you tonight?

519
00:29:28,737 --> 00:29:31,573
I'm too tired.
Just a song.

520
00:29:31,872 --> 00:29:33,274
Okay, what song?

521
00:29:34,509 --> 00:29:37,011
-The dead whale one.
-Okay.

<i>I don't mean to say</i>
<i>we're all robots,</i>

538
00:30:25,993 --> 00:30:27,662
<i>but I wonder</i>
<i>if you had been raised</i>

539
00:30:27,762 --> 00:30:29,698
<i>the way your mother</i>
<i>had been raised.</i>

540
00:30:29,930 --> 00:30:31,432
<i>I mean, she had a father</i>
<i>who just took off,</i>

541
00:30:31,533 --> 00:30:32,767
<i>didn't come home.</i>

542
00:30:32,866 --> 00:30:34,368
<i>Then another man</i>
<i>entered her mother's life,</i>

543
00:30:34,468 --> 00:30:37,004
<i>and she became attached to him,</i>
<i>and he bailed out.</i>

544
00:30:37,104 --> 00:30:38,305
<i>I know what you're saying.</i>

545
00:30:38,405 --> 00:30:41,141
<i>I did have that same one.</i>
<i>Very similar.</i>

546
00:30:41,241 --> 00:30:43,177
<i>But...</i>
<i>Okay, well, my question is</i>

547
00:30:43,277 --> 00:30:45,913
<i>if you had been raised</i>
<i>as your mother had been raised</i>

548
00:30:46,013 --> 00:30:47,147
<i>do you think</i>
<i>you probably would've</i>

549
00:30:47,247 --> 00:30:48,750
<i>knocked your kids around too?</i>

550
00:30:49,450 --> 00:30:50,451
See how many
you catch in your mouth.

551
00:30:50,552 --> 00:30:51,218
Okay.

552
00:30:51,318 --> 00:30:53,487
Okay, open.

553
00:30:53,588 --> 00:30:54,689
Wait. Shh.

554
00:30:54,789 --> 00:30:55,989
Fuck.
This fucking drunk bitch...

555
00:30:59,627 --> 00:31:03,364
Put this on my room, please.
It's definitely before 2:00.

556
00:31:04,898 --> 00:31:06,900
I'm gonna need to see
your ID, ma'am.

557
00:31:08,770 --> 00:31:11,071
You've never asked
me that before.

558
00:31:11,338 --> 00:31:12,973
Ma'am, I'm gonna need
to see your ID.

559
00:31:13,073 --> 00:31:15,242
You really want me to go

560
00:31:15,342 --> 00:31:17,044
all the way back up to my room,

561
00:31:17,144 --> 00:31:20,013
get my ID, and come
all the way back down here?

562
00:31:20,114 --> 00:31:22,916
It's the rule. Aren't you only
on the second floor anyway?

563
00:31:23,016 --> 00:31:24,786
When is this the fucking rule?

564
00:31:24,885 --> 00:31:26,286
I have been in here
every single night...

565
00:31:26,387 --> 00:31:27,622
Maybe I cracked open
the rulebook

566
00:31:27,722 --> 00:31:29,056
and found some shit out.

567
00:31:29,156 --> 00:31:30,924
Well, maybe you should
find my ID that's behind...

568
00:31:31,024 --> 00:31:32,092
Ladies, ladies, ladies...

569
00:31:32,192 --> 00:31:33,661
-It's the rule, ma'am!
-Ladies!

570
00:31:33,762 --> 00:31:35,830
-Ladies!
-I'm not going back!

571
00:31:35,929 --> 00:31:37,532
Ladies, whoa, whoa!

572
00:31:37,632 --> 00:31:40,635
-Ladies, calm it down, bro.
-I'm fuckin' chill.

573
00:31:40,735 --> 00:31:41,703
It's not that deep.

574
00:31:41,803 --> 00:31:42,637
She fucking barking at me.

575
00:31:42,737 --> 00:31:44,138
Just use my ID for it.

576
00:31:44,238 --> 00:31:46,006
-I can't do that.
-Why not?

577
00:31:46,106 --> 00:31:48,142
I can't use your ID
for her wine.

578
00:31:48,375 --> 00:31:51,646
Well then it's my wine,
she's just paying for it.

579
00:31:53,882 --> 00:31:55,315
She fucking took it.

580
00:32:04,458 --> 00:32:05,727
Hey!

581
00:32:08,763 --> 00:32:10,030
What?

582
00:32:12,667 --> 00:32:14,536
The name's Jamie, by the way.

583
00:32:15,402 --> 00:32:16,437
Got a light?

584
00:32:16,871 --> 00:32:18,573
I'm not interested.

585
00:32:19,339 --> 00:32:22,009
-In what?
-I need to be alone.

586
00:32:23,611 --> 00:32:25,179
Rude as hell.

587
00:32:27,014 --> 00:32:29,349
A motherfucking thank you
would've been nice, miss.

588
00:33:07,956 --> 00:33:09,323
I'm, uh, at the hotel.

589
00:33:09,423 --> 00:33:11,325
I'm outside just getting
some fresh air.

590
00:33:11,425 --> 00:33:13,962
<i>I don't like it when</i>
<i>you leave her there by herself,</i>

591
00:33:14,061 --> 00:33:15,697
<i>even for a second.</i>
<i>It isn't safe.</i>

592
00:33:15,797 --> 00:33:18,332
I'm just outside for a minute
getting some air.

593
00:33:18,432 --> 00:33:21,235
The windows don't
open in there.

594
00:33:21,335 --> 00:33:23,838
To stop everyone from killing
themselves, obviously.

595
00:33:23,938 --> 00:33:25,372
<i>All right. Yeah, yeah, yeah,</i>

596
00:33:25,472 --> 00:33:26,641
<i>but what if she wakes up</i>
<i>and she's scared or--</i>

597
00:33:26,741 --> 00:33:28,075
Well, she never wakes up,

598
00:33:28,175 --> 00:33:29,811
and anyway,
I have someone at the hotel now.

599
00:33:29,911 --> 00:33:31,211
-A babysitter.
<i>-Really?</i>

600
00:33:31,311 --> 00:33:33,480
<i>Where'd you find a babysitter?</i>
<i>Who is it?</i>

601
00:33:33,581 --> 00:33:34,649
His name's James.

602
00:33:34,749 --> 00:33:38,051
<i>His name is James?</i>
<i>He's a male babysitter?</i>

603
00:33:38,418 --> 00:33:41,255
Did you call just to call
me a bad mother, or what?

604
00:33:41,355 --> 00:33:43,357
You have no idea what it's like
not to be able to go outside

605
00:33:43,457 --> 00:33:45,025
even for a minute, by yourself.

606
00:33:45,125 --> 00:33:46,828
You can go outside
whenever you want to.

607
00:33:46,928 --> 00:33:48,863
You can go
wherever you want to.

608
00:33:48,963 --> 00:33:50,264
The machine
doesn't fucking stop...

609
00:33:50,364 --> 00:33:51,633
and there's nothing to do in--

610
00:33:51,733 --> 00:33:53,200
<i>Hey, I am over here</i>
<i>working my ass off!</i>

611
00:33:53,300 --> 00:33:55,469
Oh, my God! Who is the one who
went to a baseball game today

612
00:33:55,570 --> 00:33:58,105
and who is the one who filled
her bag with gloop 500 times,

613
00:33:58,205 --> 00:33:59,707
saw patients, picked her up,

614
00:33:59,807 --> 00:34:01,910
had to do dinner where
she only got 20 percent,

615
00:34:02,010 --> 00:34:03,076
and then had to
try to convince--

616
00:34:03,176 --> 00:34:04,612
<i>Can we please</i>
<i>not do this?</i>

617
00:34:04,712 --> 00:34:05,747
Look, I gotta go.

618
00:34:05,847 --> 00:34:07,882
The reception's really bad here.
Everything's fine.

619
00:34:07,982 --> 00:34:09,951
<i>No, no, no. Wait, wait, wait.</i>
<i>Did you go to the apart--</i>

620
00:34:27,936 --> 00:34:29,971
Yes. Yes.

621
00:34:30,070 --> 00:34:31,806
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

622
00:34:57,532 --> 00:34:59,834
Here are pics of hole.

623
00:34:59,934 --> 00:35:01,035
Forgot to send today.

624
00:35:01,134 --> 00:35:02,837
I went during lunch.

625
00:35:57,224 --> 00:36:00,628
What is movie...

626
00:36:02,630 --> 00:36:08,235
...babies, zombies,
'80s, mothers eating babies?

627
00:36:08,903 --> 00:36:10,370
<i>Here's what I found.</i>

628
00:36:10,470 --> 00:36:11,873
<i>A court has reopened...</i>

629
00:36:13,608 --> 00:36:16,476
<i>...nine-week-old baby really</i>
<i>was taken and killed by a dingo</i>

630
00:36:16,577 --> 00:36:20,180
<i>24 years after Meryl Streep</i>
<i>portrayed the Australian mother</i>

631
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:22,650
<i>wrongly jailed</i>
<i>for killing her child.</i>

632
00:36:22,750 --> 00:36:24,686
<i>Chamberlain has</i>
<i>always insisted...</i>

633
00:36:55,083 --> 00:36:56,249
What?

634
00:37:28,216 --> 00:37:29,784
Mom?

635
00:37:46,734 --> 00:37:47,702
Hello?

636
00:38:41,923 --> 00:38:44,525
<i>Wake up, Mom. Wake up. Okay.</i>

637
00:38:46,661 --> 00:38:48,930
<i>Mom. Mom. You hear us?</i>

638
00:38:51,464 --> 00:38:53,801
<i>Come on, Mom. Snap out of it.</i>

639
00:38:58,873 --> 00:39:01,309
<i>♪ If you wanna know this</i>
<i>If you wanna know that ♪</i>

640
00:39:01,408 --> 00:39:03,811
<i>♪ Come to my sugar shack ♪</i>

641
00:39:03,911 --> 00:39:05,880
Hey. Hey, you know
what would be super fun

642
00:39:05,980 --> 00:39:08,516
and like a really, really
big kid type of thing to do?

643
00:39:08,616 --> 00:39:09,750
I can't hear you.

644
00:39:09,851 --> 00:39:11,418
I said, you know
what would be super fun

645
00:39:11,519 --> 00:39:14,222
and a big kid
type of thing to do?

646
00:39:14,322 --> 00:39:15,422
What?

647
00:39:15,523 --> 00:39:16,657
If I drop you
in front of the door

648
00:39:16,757 --> 00:39:18,159
and you just go in by yourself.
Oh, my God.

649
00:39:18,259 --> 00:39:20,393
-That would be so cool of you.
-No.

650
00:39:20,493 --> 00:39:22,830
-Why not?
-All the moms walk you in.

651
00:39:22,930 --> 00:39:25,867
You're a mom. You have to walk
me in. You have to sign me in.

652
00:39:27,235 --> 00:39:29,337
Eva! Eva!

653
00:39:29,770 --> 00:39:32,340
Can you walk her in today?
Please, please, please?

654
00:39:32,439 --> 00:39:33,908
I cannot deal with the parking.

655
00:39:35,209 --> 00:39:36,409
Of course. No problem.

656
00:39:36,510 --> 00:39:37,712
-No problem.
-Thank you.

657
00:39:37,812 --> 00:39:39,347
Okay. Exciting news.
Guess what? Guess what?

658
00:39:39,446 --> 00:39:42,617
Eva will walk you in!
Go, go, go.

659
00:39:42,950 --> 00:39:44,051
Let's go!

660
00:39:44,151 --> 00:39:45,286
-Mommy, Addie scares me.
-Come on.

661
00:39:45,385 --> 00:39:48,455
She only eats Nutella.
I need you!

662
00:39:48,556 --> 00:39:51,058
-To be with you!
-Honey, please. For Mama, okay?

663
00:39:51,158 --> 00:39:53,361
-Please? Please?
-You are my mom.

664
00:39:53,460 --> 00:39:54,962
We'll go look at hamsters
today if you do it.

665
00:39:55,062 --> 00:39:56,197
"Look" at them?

666
00:39:56,297 --> 00:39:57,164
I'll get you one, okay?
Just go. Go!

667
00:39:58,498 --> 00:39:59,634
Okay, see? I love you!
I love you, okay?

668
00:39:59,734 --> 00:40:01,302
Everything's gonna be...
Shit.

669
00:40:01,401 --> 00:40:02,570
-Hi.
-Hi.

670
00:40:02,670 --> 00:40:04,471
Shit! Shit! Shit!

671
00:40:04,572 --> 00:40:07,375
I'm the worst.
I'm the fucking worst!

672
00:40:08,009 --> 00:40:10,978
And then you told me
that if you touch a baby bird,

673
00:40:11,078 --> 00:40:14,515
the mama bird will not come back
if they know you touched them.

674
00:40:15,917 --> 00:40:18,451
Hm. That must have been
some dream.

675
00:40:18,552 --> 00:40:20,021
-Do you--
-I'm not done.

676
00:40:21,355 --> 00:40:22,623
You kissed me.

677
00:40:26,459 --> 00:40:28,461
I said, you kissed me.

678
00:40:28,629 --> 00:40:32,199
Yes. I heard you.
In your dream, I kissed you.

679
00:40:32,499 --> 00:40:35,169
Yeah, and then the
next day, I felt...

680
00:40:37,371 --> 00:40:38,739
...crushing guilt.

681
00:40:38,839 --> 00:40:40,574
And I knew somehow
that your husband

682
00:40:40,675 --> 00:40:42,043
had called me an asshole.

683
00:40:45,079 --> 00:40:47,581
You know, Stephen,
we can talk about these feelings

684
00:40:47,682 --> 00:40:48,950
apart from your dreams.

685
00:40:52,219 --> 00:40:53,187
But...

686
00:40:59,026 --> 00:41:02,129
I can't help it if in my dreams
you always want to kiss me.

687
00:41:08,035 --> 00:41:09,270
What's the difference

688
00:41:09,370 --> 00:41:13,441
between going outside on hotel
property when she's sleeping...

689
00:41:13,674 --> 00:41:15,543
...and going all the way home?

690
00:41:15,810 --> 00:41:18,379
In one, I guess
I'm just a regular mom

691
00:41:18,478 --> 00:41:19,647
making a shitty choice,

692
00:41:19,747 --> 00:41:22,283
and in the other,
I'm a... I'm a...

693
00:41:22,383 --> 00:41:24,518
a straight up shitty mom.

694
00:41:24,618 --> 00:41:26,754
Well, it's not my role

695
00:41:26,854 --> 00:41:29,457
to decide whether you should
or whether you should not...

696
00:41:29,557 --> 00:41:31,225
-That's not--
-No, no, no. I shouldn't.

697
00:41:31,325 --> 00:41:32,727
I know I shouldn't.

698
00:41:32,827 --> 00:41:34,829
I shouldn't even leave
her for a second.

699
00:41:34,929 --> 00:41:38,733
I mean, it is your job to say.

700
00:41:38,833 --> 00:41:41,135
Just tell me not to do it.

701
00:41:41,235 --> 00:41:42,903
Just tell me what to do.

702
00:41:43,004 --> 00:41:46,507
I don't think you want me
to tell you what to do.

703
00:41:46,607 --> 00:41:47,708
You know what to do.

704
00:41:47,808 --> 00:41:49,243
No one will tell me what to do.

705
00:41:49,343 --> 00:41:50,578
I'm supposed to know
how to fix this.

706
00:41:50,678 --> 00:41:52,446
I'm supposed to know
how to fix her.

707
00:41:52,546 --> 00:41:55,716
What is it you think
it's your job to fix?

708
00:41:55,816 --> 00:41:58,819
She has to weigh 50 pounds
by next week, Dr. Spring said.

709
00:41:58,919 --> 00:42:01,022
That's a gain of 2.5
pounds, right?

710
00:42:01,122 --> 00:42:03,257
Each day's supposed to be
2,500 calories in

711
00:42:03,357 --> 00:42:06,060
compensating for her resting
rate at 1,800 calories burned.

712
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:08,963
That's gotta be at least 80%
of each meal for seven days

713
00:42:09,063 --> 00:42:11,632
plus the tube, and that's
if she just lays still all day.

714
00:42:11,732 --> 00:42:12,967
And if it doesn't,

715
00:42:13,067 --> 00:42:14,935
then something about
not getting the tube out

716
00:42:15,036 --> 00:42:16,704
and reassessing
the level of care.

717
00:42:16,804 --> 00:42:18,372
-What do I do?
-Tonight...

718
00:42:18,472 --> 00:42:21,542
I would like you
to get a good night sleep.

719
00:42:21,642 --> 00:42:23,477
So would I,
but I'm asking you a thing.

720
00:42:23,577 --> 00:42:26,914
An actual thing, a problem to
fix, and I need help with this.

721
00:42:27,014 --> 00:42:28,849
Am I supposed to just sit
around and watch her fail

722
00:42:28,949 --> 00:42:31,352
and this is just gonna
go on forever? What do I do?

723
00:42:31,452 --> 00:42:33,522
Okay. That means
there's no drinking.

724
00:42:33,621 --> 00:42:35,656
There's no drugs. There's no...

725
00:42:35,756 --> 00:42:39,593
Are you listening to me?!
Can you hear me?!

726
00:42:41,195 --> 00:42:43,764
I'm asking you what
I'm supposed to do!

727
00:42:52,173 --> 00:42:53,641
Why don't you like me?

728
00:42:56,610 --> 00:42:58,079
Why don't I like you?

729
00:42:58,179 --> 00:43:01,182
I know you won't answer me.
Just forget it.

730
00:43:02,551 --> 00:43:04,785
That is incredibly unfair.

731
00:43:06,821 --> 00:43:10,024
Why is this so important to you
right now?

732
00:43:16,163 --> 00:43:19,200
I just want someone
to tell me what to do.

733
00:43:19,300 --> 00:43:20,901
No one will tell me.

734
00:43:24,772 --> 00:43:27,074
I love him,
I love him, I love him.

735
00:43:27,775 --> 00:43:29,176
-When we get home,

736
00:43:29,276 --> 00:43:31,178
he can live a happy life there.

737
00:43:31,278 --> 00:43:34,281
And we're gonna have
him forever, and ever, and ever,

738
00:43:34,381 --> 00:43:36,250
and ever, and ever.

739
00:43:36,817 --> 00:43:39,987
I love him. I'm gonna kiss him,
and I'm gonna hug him.

740
00:43:40,688 --> 00:43:43,525
Oh, my God. Maybe
his name should be S'mores.

741
00:43:43,624 --> 00:43:44,925
That's really nice.

742
00:43:45,025 --> 00:43:47,228
I said, don't open the box.

743
00:43:47,328 --> 00:43:49,797
I just wanna see him.
He's been scratching.

744
00:43:49,897 --> 00:43:52,133
He doesn't like being
in the box.

745
00:43:52,366 --> 00:43:53,434
He's trying to get out.

746
00:43:53,535 --> 00:43:56,837
Can you hold it closed, please?
And keep it closed.

747
00:43:57,138 --> 00:43:59,974
He's scratching me!
He's supposed to love me.

748
00:44:00,074 --> 00:44:00,941
Close the box.

749
00:44:01,041 --> 00:44:02,577
I can't.

750
00:44:02,676 --> 00:44:04,111
Mommy, he's getting out.

751
00:44:04,211 --> 00:44:06,380
Just hand it to me.
Hand it to me.

752
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:07,715
He's gonna jump out.

753
00:44:07,815 --> 00:44:09,116
-He hates us.
-Give it to me. I can't see.

754
00:44:09,216 --> 00:44:11,051
Give it to me.

755
00:44:11,152 --> 00:44:12,286
I think we got
the wrong hamster.

756
00:44:12,386 --> 00:44:13,087
Shit.

757
00:44:14,054 --> 00:44:16,056
Ow! Shit.

758
00:44:16,323 --> 00:44:18,292
-We're gonna die.
-No, we're not gonna die,

759
00:44:18,392 --> 00:44:19,493
but I have to pull over.

760
00:44:19,594 --> 00:44:21,061
Ow! Shit!

761
00:44:21,162 --> 00:44:22,263
-Maybe this isn't S'mores.
-Oh, my God.

762
00:44:22,363 --> 00:44:24,431
-It's out. It's out! Shit. Shit.
-Oh, my...

763
00:44:24,533 --> 00:44:27,401
Mommy. Oh, my God. It's out.

764
00:44:27,701 --> 00:44:28,936
Why aren't you
putting that back in?

765
00:44:29,036 --> 00:44:30,237
Just put it back in.

766
00:44:30,337 --> 00:44:33,274
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Oh, my God. Oh, my God!

767
00:44:33,374 --> 00:44:35,644
Please! Put him back in!

768
00:44:36,177 --> 00:44:38,012
I don't want it.
I don't want him anymore.

769
00:44:38,112 --> 00:44:39,480
He's bad.

770
00:44:42,449 --> 00:44:44,685
Okay. Okay, hey, hey, hey.

771
00:44:44,785 --> 00:44:46,053
You're fine.

772
00:44:46,153 --> 00:44:48,889
You're fine, and I'm fine, okay?
Nobody is hurt.

773
00:44:48,989 --> 00:44:51,225
Let's...

774
00:44:51,325 --> 00:44:52,561
Take it with you!
Take it with you!

775
00:44:52,661 --> 00:44:53,794
-I'll be right back.
-It's gonna hurt me!

776
00:44:54,629 --> 00:44:57,064
I hate my hamster!

777
00:44:57,164 --> 00:44:59,601
-Hey, man. What are you doing?
-Hey, hey, hey.

778
00:44:59,700 --> 00:45:01,502
Oh. You're lucky
there's no damage.

779
00:45:01,603 --> 00:45:02,970
We don't have to
exchange information.

780
00:45:03,070 --> 00:45:05,039
What? My kid is in that car.
Do you hear her crying, huh?

781
00:45:05,139 --> 00:45:06,707
You scared her to death,
you dick.

782
00:45:06,941 --> 00:45:09,877
Hey, Mom.
It was barely just a tap.

783
00:45:09,977 --> 00:45:12,146
Don't fucking call me Mommy.
She thought we were gonna die.

784
00:45:12,246 --> 00:45:14,848
Don't fuck with me
about my child's safety. Huh?

785
00:45:14,949 --> 00:45:16,784
-Give me all your information.
-What the fuck is that?

786
00:45:16,884 --> 00:45:18,953
-What?!
-That! That!

787
00:45:21,155 --> 00:45:22,423
Mommy!

788
00:45:24,425 --> 00:45:25,326
Oh.

789
00:45:28,796 --> 00:45:32,833
Mommy, what happened?!
Mommy!

790
00:45:33,500 --> 00:45:36,470
I love you.
I miss you. Come back here.

791
00:45:37,972 --> 00:45:40,941
Everything is under control.

792
00:45:48,415 --> 00:45:49,750
Stop.

793
00:45:49,850 --> 00:45:52,520
Do you know that I love you

794
00:45:52,621 --> 00:45:55,256
and I think you're the best

795
00:45:55,356 --> 00:45:59,026
and so proud of you
for everything,

796
00:45:59,126 --> 00:46:03,831
and you can do it,
and you're almost all better.

797
00:46:03,931 --> 00:46:05,866
-You're so good.
-Mommy, stop.

798
00:46:05,966 --> 00:46:09,671
What? I can't stop.
I just love you too much.

799
00:46:10,070 --> 00:46:12,540
You smell like wine.

800
00:46:28,690 --> 00:46:30,424
Hello?

801
00:46:31,526 --> 00:46:33,961
<i>Hi, it's... it's Caroline.</i>

802
00:46:34,061 --> 00:46:35,963
<i>Caroline Primm, your patient.</i>

803
00:46:36,063 --> 00:46:37,865
<i>I'm sorry it's so late.</i>

804
00:46:38,132 --> 00:46:41,802
Um... Oh.
Is this an emergency?

805
00:46:42,369 --> 00:46:45,806
Because, um,
if this is an emergency,

806
00:46:45,906 --> 00:46:47,841
you need to hang up and--

807
00:46:47,941 --> 00:46:50,144
<i>It's not an emergency. I just--</i>

808
00:46:50,244 --> 00:46:52,846
<i>I forgot to call you yesterday.</i>

809
00:46:54,315 --> 00:46:55,550
What?

810
00:46:55,849 --> 00:46:57,885
<i>Well, you told me</i>
<i>to take Riley for a walk</i>

811
00:46:57,985 --> 00:47:00,454
<i>after I took a bath</i>
<i>and calmed down</i>

812
00:47:00,555 --> 00:47:02,423
<i>and I did it, and I</i>
<i>forgot to call you--</i>

813
00:47:02,524 --> 00:47:05,125
Oh. Okay, yes. Um...

814
00:47:05,225 --> 00:47:09,463
Well, uh, that's good,
and, um...

815
00:47:10,197 --> 00:47:13,934
Uh, I-- I do feel though that I
should tell you that this number

816
00:47:14,034 --> 00:47:17,137
is really for emergencies
only, okay?

817
00:47:18,005 --> 00:47:20,474
<i>Oh. I'm sorry. I just...</i>

818
00:47:20,775 --> 00:47:22,843
<i>I just couldn't sleep</i>
<i>thinking that you were worried.</i>

819
00:47:22,943 --> 00:47:24,912
I wasn't worried.

820
00:47:25,714 --> 00:47:29,216
<i>You... You weren't?</i>
<i>You weren't thinking about me?</i>

821
00:47:29,316 --> 00:47:31,852
I said that you could
call me if you...

822
00:47:31,952 --> 00:47:34,121
I said you could call me
if you couldn't calm down

823
00:47:34,221 --> 00:47:35,790
not that you had to call me.

824
00:47:35,923 --> 00:47:38,693
But, um...
but are you safe, Caroline?

825
00:47:38,793 --> 00:47:40,027
Are you...?

826
00:47:40,494 --> 00:47:43,897
<i>I'm... I'm sorry.</i>
<i>I... I misunderstood.</i>

827
00:47:44,365 --> 00:47:47,868
<i>Yeah, I'm so dumb. Um...</i>
<i>Yes, I'm safe.</i>

828
00:47:47,968 --> 00:47:52,373
Okay. Well, let's talk about
this in session, okay?

829
00:47:53,240 --> 00:47:55,909
<i>I'm sorry.</i>
<i>I'm obviously bothering you.</i>

830
00:47:56,009 --> 00:47:58,212
It is not your fault, uh...

831
00:47:58,312 --> 00:48:01,248
and I will--
I'll see you next week.

832
00:48:01,649 --> 00:48:03,217
<i>Well, can I come in tomorrow?</i>

833
00:48:03,518 --> 00:48:06,755
<i>It's just waiting</i>
<i>until next week seems too long.</i>

834
00:48:07,187 --> 00:48:09,356
Uh, well, let me
check my schedule,

835
00:48:09,456 --> 00:48:12,159
and I will text you a time,
okay?

836
00:48:12,993 --> 00:48:14,928
<i>Okay. Um, I'm sor--</i>

837
00:48:20,467 --> 00:48:23,772
You've gotta be fucking
kidding me! Shit!

838
00:48:26,974 --> 00:48:28,475
Hello?

839
00:48:28,576 --> 00:48:29,511
Hello?

840
00:48:30,578 --> 00:48:32,045
Hello!

841
00:48:32,146 --> 00:48:35,215
Hello! Is anyone here
doing their job?

842
00:48:43,357 --> 00:48:44,458
Shit.

843
00:48:47,695 --> 00:48:49,229
Want some help with that?

844
00:48:50,665 --> 00:48:52,634
I know a trick. Got a knife.

845
00:49:03,645 --> 00:49:04,813
Sweetie?

846
00:49:04,913 --> 00:49:06,947
Little Bear, open up.
It's Mommy.

847
00:49:07,047 --> 00:49:10,150
Little Bear, open up.

848
00:49:18,192 --> 00:49:20,160
What is she doing?

849
00:49:21,930 --> 00:49:23,898
Whoa. Whoa, whoa.

850
00:49:24,264 --> 00:49:26,200
-What the fuck's your problem?
-What? Whoa.

851
00:49:26,300 --> 00:49:27,702
What, you're obsessed with me
or something?

852
00:49:27,802 --> 00:49:29,571
What are you talking about?
Don't flatter yourself.

853
00:49:29,671 --> 00:49:31,506
Well, why are you looking at me?
What? What do you want?

854
00:49:31,606 --> 00:49:33,508
I don't want you just sitting
outside and by yourself.

855
00:49:33,608 --> 00:49:34,676
Some creep might walk past
or something.

856
00:49:34,776 --> 00:49:35,877
What creep?

857
00:49:35,976 --> 00:49:37,244
How the fuck do I know, lady?

858
00:49:37,344 --> 00:49:38,312
There's creeps
all over this place.

859
00:49:38,412 --> 00:49:40,515
-Don't call me lady.
-My bad, miss.

860
00:49:40,615 --> 00:49:42,517
Don't call me miss.
Don't. Just don't.

861
00:49:42,617 --> 00:49:44,017
Ma'am.

862
00:49:44,117 --> 00:49:45,753
<i>-Frau?</i>
-Yeah.

863
00:49:45,854 --> 00:49:47,454
-Slag.
-Oh, my God.

864
00:49:47,555 --> 00:49:49,256
Your thottiness?

865
00:49:50,157 --> 00:49:52,259
Housewife?

866
00:49:52,359 --> 00:49:54,361
At this point, I don't even know
what to refer to you as.

867
00:49:54,461 --> 00:49:56,263
I'm gonna just call you female.

868
00:49:56,865 --> 00:49:58,733
Yo, crazy pants.

869
00:49:59,166 --> 00:50:01,368
I was gonna partake
in surfing the web

870
00:50:01,468 --> 00:50:03,136
for some things that I'm into,

871
00:50:03,237 --> 00:50:06,206
if you catch my drift, and
I'm just putting it out there,

872
00:50:06,306 --> 00:50:08,877
you more than welcome to join.

873
00:50:09,176 --> 00:50:11,713
No pressure. Just saying.

874
00:50:15,048 --> 00:50:16,551
What kind of stuff?

875
00:50:22,590 --> 00:50:24,358
Is that like
the dark web?

876
00:50:24,592 --> 00:50:27,962
Like where you can
buy people and stuff?

877
00:50:28,061 --> 00:50:30,732
I don't know.
Never bought a person, so...

878
00:50:30,832 --> 00:50:33,233
But you could? Or sell one?

879
00:50:33,668 --> 00:50:36,871
I mean, I guess so, but
I don't come on the dark web

880
00:50:36,971 --> 00:50:38,907
searching for that
kind of shit, so...

881
00:50:39,007 --> 00:50:41,208
Aren't there places on there

882
00:50:41,308 --> 00:50:44,012
where people, like, show
each other videos of murders

883
00:50:44,111 --> 00:50:45,914
and people they're
holding captive?

884
00:50:46,014 --> 00:50:47,849
Can we change the subject?
Let's buy drugs.

885
00:50:47,949 --> 00:50:49,182
Let's get some...

886
00:50:49,283 --> 00:50:50,885
...some shit, right? Come on.
What do you want?

887
00:50:50,985 --> 00:50:52,286
What are you into?

888
00:50:53,487 --> 00:50:55,723
I don't know.
Do they have, like...

889
00:50:56,024 --> 00:50:57,825
cocaine or something?

890
00:50:58,392 --> 00:51:00,695
When was the last time
you tried cocaine?

891
00:51:01,663 --> 00:51:03,631
What do you mean?
It's a very popular drug.

892
00:51:03,731 --> 00:51:04,966
I like it.

893
00:51:05,700 --> 00:51:10,137
All right. Well, I'm getting
molly, so we'll get both.

894
00:51:10,772 --> 00:51:12,406
See, the thing is,

895
00:51:12,507 --> 00:51:14,609
I don't get paid till next week,
so I need you to cover me.

896
00:51:14,709 --> 00:51:16,878
Oh. Oh, I'm-- No.

897
00:51:16,978 --> 00:51:19,212
No, no.
I see what this is about.

898
00:51:19,647 --> 00:51:21,448
-Where you going?
-I'm going back to my room.

899
00:51:21,549 --> 00:51:23,417
For what?
You don't even have a key.

900
00:51:23,518 --> 00:51:25,085
Besides, your daughter's
passed out.

901
00:51:25,185 --> 00:51:27,689
Front desk lady's
definitely in a coma by now.

902
00:51:27,789 --> 00:51:30,959
Calm down. Come sit down.
Let's order. Jeez.

903
00:51:31,059 --> 00:51:32,860
I could put it on my
credit card, I guess.

904
00:51:33,427 --> 00:51:34,494
What? No.

905
00:51:34,596 --> 00:51:36,363
The 400, I could put
it on my credit card.

906
00:51:36,463 --> 00:51:38,967
No, no. See, man,
it can't be traced back to you.

907
00:51:39,067 --> 00:51:40,702
It has to be anonymous.

908
00:51:40,802 --> 00:51:45,607
Well, then how do you
pay for the stuff?

909
00:51:45,873 --> 00:51:47,240
All right, what we could do is

910
00:51:47,341 --> 00:51:49,242
we could go to a pharmacy
or something real quick

911
00:51:49,343 --> 00:51:51,579
and put it on one of
those gift cards

912
00:51:51,679 --> 00:51:54,515
or maybe you got bitcoin, or
crypto, or some shit like that?

913
00:51:54,616 --> 00:51:56,183
No, I don't have
any of that stuff,

914
00:51:56,283 --> 00:51:58,251
and I can't get in a car

915
00:51:58,352 --> 00:52:00,354
and leave my daughter alone
in the middle of the night.

916
00:52:00,655 --> 00:52:03,057
You leave your daughter alone
all the time.

917
00:52:03,190 --> 00:52:05,258
No, I don't. That's just
if I go in the field.

918
00:52:05,359 --> 00:52:08,630
Ha! I literally seen you leave
your daughter alone myself

919
00:52:08,730 --> 00:52:09,631
with my own two eyes.

920
00:52:09,731 --> 00:52:11,099
-What's the problem this time?
-What are you?

921
00:52:11,198 --> 00:52:12,600
You stalking me or something?

922
00:52:12,700 --> 00:52:15,402
I'm a concerned citizen.
I mean, takes a village, right?

923
00:52:19,874 --> 00:52:20,808
What?

924
00:52:27,048 --> 00:52:30,217
Sweetie! Sweetie! It's Mommy!

925
00:52:30,317 --> 00:52:32,654
You locked me out. Sweetie!

926
00:52:32,754 --> 00:52:34,122
Sweetie! Open the door!

927
00:52:34,221 --> 00:52:36,323
Little Bear, open the door!

928
00:52:37,257 --> 00:52:38,526
<i>Mommy...</i>

929
00:52:38,626 --> 00:52:41,896
Just wheel the machine over
and open the door!

930
00:52:42,897 --> 00:52:44,498
Little Bear!

931
00:52:46,768 --> 00:52:48,936
Open the door!

932
00:52:49,037 --> 00:52:50,805
I locked myself out!

933
00:52:50,905 --> 00:52:52,874
It's Mom! It's Mommy!

934
00:52:52,974 --> 00:52:54,241
<i>Mommy?</i>

935
00:52:54,942 --> 00:52:56,476
<i>Are you there?</i>

936
00:53:05,820 --> 00:53:08,188
I'm not sure how we can
talk about anything helpful

937
00:53:08,288 --> 00:53:10,424
if you won't even look
me in the eye.

938
00:53:10,525 --> 00:53:12,994
You asked me for this
extra session.

939
00:53:13,094 --> 00:53:15,195
I can't.

940
00:53:15,295 --> 00:53:17,165
You must be so mad at me.

941
00:53:17,264 --> 00:53:19,000
Mad? Oh, because you called me?

942
00:53:19,100 --> 00:53:20,968
No, no, no. I'm not mad at you.

943
00:53:21,334 --> 00:53:23,270
Let's move on. Please?

944
00:53:26,174 --> 00:53:28,208
You have a daughter.

945
00:53:30,277 --> 00:53:32,180
Why didn't you ever tell me?

946
00:53:32,479 --> 00:53:34,148
Well, this isn't about me.

947
00:53:34,247 --> 00:53:35,983
But now I know that you know.

948
00:53:37,151 --> 00:53:38,186
You know.

949
00:53:38,586 --> 00:53:42,123
I don't know.
You need to tell me.

950
00:53:42,222 --> 00:53:43,891
It's not your fault.

951
00:53:45,225 --> 00:53:46,761
But it is mine.

952
00:53:47,260 --> 00:53:50,698
Okay, you know, Caroline I think
that it may be time that we...

953
00:53:50,798 --> 00:53:51,899
um...

954
00:53:52,967 --> 00:53:55,870
...that we consult with someone

955
00:53:55,970 --> 00:53:58,973
about some medication for you.

956
00:53:59,439 --> 00:54:02,210
Well, I can't take medication.
I'm breastfeeding.

957
00:54:02,910 --> 00:54:06,379
-Do you want me to kill my baby?
-Of course not.

958
00:54:06,480 --> 00:54:09,717
I just think if a doctor thinks
it could be beneficial,

959
00:54:09,817 --> 00:54:11,652
then maybe we need to...

960
00:54:11,753 --> 00:54:17,558
prioritize your... your...
health over breastfeeding.

961
00:54:17,892 --> 00:54:19,392
Just right now.

962
00:54:19,961 --> 00:54:22,163
You know, you need to take
care of yourself

963
00:54:22,262 --> 00:54:24,031
so you can take care of Riley.

964
00:54:25,133 --> 00:54:26,968
I have to go to the bathroom.

965
00:54:30,571 --> 00:54:34,474
Um, well, we only have
15 minutes left.

966
00:54:35,109 --> 00:54:37,245
I have to go now.

967
00:54:37,344 --> 00:54:39,479
Okay, well, can you wait
till after the session?

968
00:54:39,580 --> 00:54:40,447
No?

969
00:55:24,258 --> 00:55:25,927
Oh... Oh.

970
00:55:27,895 --> 00:55:28,830
Shit.

971
00:55:38,438 --> 00:55:40,975
Oh. Okay, okay. Okay.

972
00:55:49,150 --> 00:55:50,117
Okay.

973
00:55:59,260 --> 00:56:01,461
Caroline? Excuse me.

974
00:56:02,997 --> 00:56:04,364
Caroline?

975
00:56:11,105 --> 00:56:12,039
It's okay.

976
00:56:13,774 --> 00:56:16,177
Caroline? Excuse me. Caroline?

977
00:56:16,277 --> 00:56:18,512
I need you
to help me out here. I...

978
00:56:24,619 --> 00:56:28,022
Okay. I know. I know.

979
00:56:39,166 --> 00:56:40,134
Caroline?

980
00:57:00,221 --> 00:57:01,856
Okay. Okay.

981
00:57:02,757 --> 00:57:03,925
Caroline!

982
00:57:04,759 --> 00:57:05,860
Caroline!

983
00:57:09,030 --> 00:57:10,564
Yeah. I know.

984
00:57:16,469 --> 00:57:18,773
What is going on here?
I'm in a session.

985
00:57:18,973 --> 00:57:20,942
So, my patient,
she has this baby

986
00:57:21,042 --> 00:57:22,777
and she said she was
going to the bathroom

987
00:57:22,877 --> 00:57:25,478
and then she left the baby
with me and I...

988
00:57:25,579 --> 00:57:27,581
-She's gone. And now I can't--
-I'm with a patient.

989
00:57:27,682 --> 00:57:29,482
Please, I need your help.
I really need your help.

990
00:57:29,583 --> 00:57:30,885
I'm with a patient.

991
00:57:30,985 --> 00:57:33,321
Plus, also,
I'm not your supervisor.

992
00:57:33,421 --> 00:57:35,790
This is a professional issue.
This is not a treatment issue.

993
00:57:35,890 --> 00:57:37,525
Are you joking?
This is an emergency!

994
00:57:37,625 --> 00:57:38,826
Whatever's happening in here

995
00:57:38,926 --> 00:57:40,561
is not as important
as what I'm going through here!

996
00:57:40,661 --> 00:57:42,229
-Okay, no.
-I need your help!

997
00:57:42,330 --> 00:57:43,364
-Goodbye.
-I need your help!

998
00:57:43,463 --> 00:57:44,699
This is an emergency.

999
00:57:44,799 --> 00:57:46,968
-You can come back later.
-Absolutely not.

1000
00:57:50,271 --> 00:57:51,572
No!

1001
00:57:57,044 --> 00:57:58,112
Okay.

1002
00:58:01,415 --> 00:58:02,450
<i>-Hello?</i>
-Hello?

1003
00:58:02,550 --> 00:58:03,751
Hello. Hello. Yes.

1004
00:58:03,851 --> 00:58:05,219
Hello, I am
your wife's psychotherapist...

1005
00:58:05,319 --> 00:58:06,587
<i>Stop, I can't...</i>

1006
00:58:06,687 --> 00:58:08,022
and she left today in
the middle of her appointment.

1007
00:58:08,122 --> 00:58:11,826
<i>I cannot hear you.</i>
<i>I cannot hear you. Who is this?</i>

1008
00:58:14,128 --> 00:58:17,164
Okay. Yes.
This is your wife's therapist.

1009
00:58:17,264 --> 00:58:19,567
She left in the middle
of her appointment today...

1010
00:58:19,667 --> 00:58:21,202
<i>-All right. You gotta stop.</i>
-And...

1011
00:58:21,302 --> 00:58:23,204
<i>You gotta stop. I have no idea</i>
<i>what you're even talking about.</i>

1012
00:58:23,304 --> 00:58:24,772
<i>Who is this?</i>

1013
00:58:25,439 --> 00:58:27,041
Is your wife named
Caroline Primm?

1014
00:58:27,141 --> 00:58:28,876
And you are, um...

1015
00:58:28,976 --> 00:58:31,312
Your baby's name is Riley?
And you are Nick Primm?

1016
00:58:31,412 --> 00:58:33,647
<i>-Yes.</i>
-Okay, yes, right. Well--

1017
00:58:33,748 --> 00:58:34,982
<i>My wife doesn't have</i>
<i>a therapist.</i>

1018
00:58:35,082 --> 00:58:36,517
Okay, well,
she has been my patient

1019
00:58:36,617 --> 00:58:39,053
at The Center for
Psychological Arts in Montauk

1020
00:58:39,153 --> 00:58:41,022
since she was about
six months pregnant

1021
00:58:41,122 --> 00:58:43,457
with Riley, and today...

1022
00:58:43,758 --> 00:58:45,292
<i>Well, this is news to me.</i>

1023
00:58:45,393 --> 00:58:47,962
Mm. Well, whether...

1024
00:58:48,062 --> 00:58:49,697
...you knew that she
was my patient or not,

1025
00:58:49,797 --> 00:58:51,032
what I'm trying to say to you

1026
00:58:51,132 --> 00:58:52,700
is that this is an emergency,
and I really...

1027
00:58:52,800 --> 00:58:54,735
She left your baby here with me,

1028
00:58:54,835 --> 00:58:56,871
and I need you to come
and pick him up.

1029
00:58:56,971 --> 00:58:59,340
<i>What do you mean?</i>
<i>What do you mean?</i>

1030
00:58:59,440 --> 00:59:00,408
What do you mean,
what do I mean?

1031
00:59:00,509 --> 00:59:01,375
<i>She left the baby?</i>

1032
00:59:01,475 --> 00:59:02,743
She's not answering her phone...

1033
00:59:02,843 --> 00:59:04,378
<i>She's probably in the bathroom</i>

1034
00:59:04,478 --> 00:59:05,846
<i>or by a fucking</i>
<i>vending machine.</i>

1035
00:59:05,946 --> 00:59:06,647
Okay.

1036
00:59:06,747 --> 00:59:07,915
I suggest that you call her.

1037
00:59:08,015 --> 00:59:09,316
Maybe she would pick up
if it was you.

1038
00:59:09,417 --> 00:59:12,019
I'm gonna text you my address
to come and get the baby.

1039
00:59:12,119 --> 00:59:13,487
<i>Oh, Jesus Christ!</i>

1040
00:59:13,587 --> 00:59:14,922
I'm sure she's okay.
I'm sure she's okay.

1041
00:59:15,022 --> 00:59:16,924
<i>I cannot even believe this.</i>

1042
00:59:17,024 --> 00:59:18,659
I'm sure she's okay. I'm sure--

1043
00:59:18,759 --> 00:59:20,961
<i>You know what? This is</i>
<i>so fucking typical of her.</i>

1044
00:59:21,062 --> 00:59:24,331
Okay. Well, she probably
just needed some space.

1045
00:59:24,665 --> 00:59:27,168
I'm gonna text you
my address where...

1046
00:59:27,802 --> 00:59:29,670
-so you can come and get her.
<i>-Okay, look. Listen to me.</i>

1047
00:59:29,770 --> 00:59:31,105
-Him.
<i>-Listen to me.</i>

1048
00:59:31,205 --> 00:59:33,808
<i>I'm at work right now.</i>
<i>I am at work right now.</i>

1049
00:59:33,908 --> 00:59:35,109
<i>That's why she's supposed to be</i>

1050
00:59:35,209 --> 00:59:36,577
<i>taking care</i>
<i>of the fucking baby,</i>

1051
00:59:36,677 --> 00:59:39,146
<i>so I can work, okay?</i>

1052
00:59:39,246 --> 00:59:41,749
<i>Here's what I'm gonna do.</i>
<i>I'm gonna text you my address.</i>

1053
00:59:41,849 --> 00:59:43,250
<i>I'm in Amagansett.</i>

1054
00:59:43,350 --> 00:59:44,852
<i>You can drop the baby off</i>
<i>at this address, okay?</i>

1055
00:59:44,952 --> 00:59:46,987
Okay, well, I can't do that,

1056
00:59:47,088 --> 00:59:49,790
and I am actually very
concerned about your wife.

1057
00:59:49,890 --> 00:59:51,592
This is an emergency, and she--

1058
00:59:51,692 --> 00:59:53,260
<i>You know, you've used</i>
<i>that term twice now.</i>

1059
00:59:53,360 --> 00:59:54,829
<i>This isn't my emergency.</i>

1060
00:59:54,929 --> 00:59:56,430
<i>I'm not the one</i>
<i>who lost my fucking wife!</i>

1061
00:59:56,531 --> 00:59:59,100
I need you to come down here
and get your baby immediately,

1062
00:59:59,200 --> 01:00:00,768
and if you're not here
within a half an hour,

1063
01:00:00,868 --> 01:00:02,403
I'm going to call the police.
I will text you the address.

1064
01:00:02,503 --> 01:00:03,904
-Thank you very much.
<i>-Oh, Jesus--</i>

1065
01:00:14,748 --> 01:00:16,817
-Yes?
<i>-Hi, it's Stephen.</i>

1066
01:00:42,776 --> 01:00:44,311
May I come in?

1067
01:00:52,286 --> 01:00:55,356
I'm expecting a patient.
He just buzzed in.

1068
01:01:05,799 --> 01:01:07,569
Would you mind waiting
in my office

1069
01:01:07,668 --> 01:01:09,670
down the hall
just a few moments?

1070
01:01:10,938 --> 01:01:13,608
Your office?
Who are you, the boss?

1071
01:01:13,974 --> 01:01:16,143
No. Just another therapist.

1072
01:01:16,243 --> 01:01:17,878
I have an office.
It's down the hall.

1073
01:01:17,978 --> 01:01:19,680
Door is open. You'll see it.

1074
01:01:21,916 --> 01:01:23,751
This is my time.
She's mine right now.

1075
01:01:23,851 --> 01:01:25,719
You can't make me wait, okay?

1076
01:01:25,819 --> 01:01:27,755
This is an emergency situation.

1077
01:01:27,855 --> 01:01:29,790
You can either wait in my office

1078
01:01:29,890 --> 01:01:31,959
or you need to
leave the building entirely.

1079
01:01:35,630 --> 01:01:37,464
Is that a baby?

1080
01:01:37,566 --> 01:01:39,133
Is that your baby?
You have a baby?

1081
01:01:39,233 --> 01:01:41,101
I mean, do you guys
have a baby together?

1082
01:01:41,202 --> 01:01:44,673
Okay, this situation
does not concern you, okay?

1083
01:01:44,772 --> 01:01:46,240
Make a choice.

1084
01:01:52,514 --> 01:01:54,815
Okay, I'll be in your office.

1085
01:01:54,915 --> 01:01:56,784
But I won't wait that long.

1086
01:02:02,591 --> 01:02:03,490
Okay.

1087
01:02:15,035 --> 01:02:16,003
Wow.

1088
01:02:17,771 --> 01:02:20,307
Can you believe that
I got talked into getting

1089
01:02:20,407 --> 01:02:24,713
this fucking hamster
after all of that? My God, I...

1090
01:02:26,080 --> 01:02:28,382
She's right. I really am
so stretchable.

1091
01:02:28,482 --> 01:02:30,552
-It's disgusting.
-You know...

1092
01:02:31,018 --> 01:02:32,520
when I was in medical school,

1093
01:02:32,621 --> 01:02:35,923
I had to do a stint
in a medical experiments lab.

1094
01:02:36,390 --> 01:02:41,795
And we were testing
the efficacy of a drug on rats.

1095
01:02:42,597 --> 01:02:44,733
Oh, I... So cool.

1096
01:02:44,832 --> 01:02:49,103
And the way it worked is
we'd take the rats,

1097
01:02:49,203 --> 01:02:52,473
and we'd drop them
in this guillotine thingy,

1098
01:02:52,906 --> 01:02:56,678
chop their heads off
individually,

1099
01:02:56,777 --> 01:02:59,046
peel the skin back

1100
01:02:59,146 --> 01:03:01,482
and then look at their brains
under a microscope.

1101
01:03:02,816 --> 01:03:05,185
I'm just so curious

1102
01:03:05,286 --> 01:03:08,122
about the process with that.
I wonder--

1103
01:03:08,222 --> 01:03:13,093
The rats would claw
and bite you...

1104
01:03:13,695 --> 01:03:17,898
...when you put your hand
in the cage to pick them up.

1105
01:03:17,998 --> 01:03:23,505
So they gave us
these steel chain mail gloves.

1106
01:03:24,071 --> 01:03:26,574
They're German.
They're beautiful.

1107
01:03:27,041 --> 01:03:30,545
So you put on the glove and
you put your hand in the cage,

1108
01:03:31,178 --> 01:03:34,114
and the rats would just
attach themselves to the glove,

1109
01:03:35,149 --> 01:03:36,884
clinging for dear
life, you know?

1110
01:03:39,521 --> 01:03:41,589
And then when you got
to the guillotine box,

1111
01:03:41,690 --> 01:03:44,158
you had to shake them off.

1112
01:03:45,059 --> 01:03:46,827
Really shake them.

1113
01:03:47,094 --> 01:03:50,130
I was always worried
that the rat would get hurt

1114
01:03:50,230 --> 01:03:52,466
when it hit its head on the
guillotine, you know?

1115
01:03:55,570 --> 01:03:58,172
But their brains
were always fine

1116
01:03:58,272 --> 01:03:59,808
when we looked under
the microscope.

1117
01:04:03,410 --> 01:04:04,779
Oh.

1118
01:04:04,878 --> 01:04:09,651
Rodents are
resilient creatures.

1119
01:04:16,423 --> 01:04:18,158
Mm-hm. Yeah.

1120
01:04:23,897 --> 01:04:26,166
I'll tell Stephen
your session's cancelled.

1121
01:04:28,102 --> 01:04:30,605
You have to take care
of this, okay?

1122
01:04:33,808 --> 01:04:35,242
I love you.

1123
01:04:42,916 --> 01:04:45,052
Just tell me, was she suicidal?
Homicidal?

1124
01:04:45,886 --> 01:04:48,021
No. Mm-mm. No.

1125
01:04:48,122 --> 01:04:50,692
No, she was obsessed
with protecting the baby...

1126
01:04:50,991 --> 01:04:52,527
And, uh, yeah.

1127
01:04:52,627 --> 01:04:53,961
She wouldn't hurt the baby.

1128
01:04:54,061 --> 01:04:55,630
And she didn't talk
about suicide.

1129
01:04:55,730 --> 01:04:56,964
She wouldn't abandon Riley.

1130
01:04:57,064 --> 01:04:58,932
She just did abandon him.

1131
01:04:59,466 --> 01:05:01,969
Right, well, you know,
I mean, um...

1132
01:05:02,069 --> 01:05:05,038
you know, permanently. Forever.

1133
01:05:07,341 --> 01:05:09,076
Is that it?
I have another patient waiting

1134
01:05:09,176 --> 01:05:11,412
who really needs my help.

1135
01:05:12,045 --> 01:05:14,915
It's fine. It's more common
than you think.

1136
01:05:15,315 --> 01:05:17,084
A woman tries to run away
from all the responsibilities.

1137
01:05:17,184 --> 01:05:18,720
-Yeah.
-Everybody gets all upset,

1138
01:05:18,820 --> 01:05:20,789
then they come back with
their tails between their legs.

1139
01:05:20,889 --> 01:05:23,490
Okay. Okay.

1140
01:05:24,091 --> 01:05:26,093
Thank you, Officer.

1141
01:05:28,696 --> 01:05:30,565
<i>When</i>
<i>you have finished recording,</i>

1142
01:05:30,665 --> 01:05:33,200
<i>you may hang up or press one</i>
<i>for more options.</i>

1143
01:05:33,300 --> 01:05:34,803
Hi. Hi,

1144
01:05:34,903 --> 01:05:36,036
it's, uh... it's me again,

1145
01:05:36,136 --> 01:05:38,205
your tenant from
22 Algonquin, unit one.

1146
01:05:38,305 --> 01:05:41,341
You know, the one with the giant
fucking hole in the ceiling!

1147
01:05:41,709 --> 01:05:43,878
Your repairs guy ran off,
and it's getting worse

1148
01:05:43,977 --> 01:05:45,713
and I want to know why
you're doing nothing,

1149
01:05:45,814 --> 01:05:47,715
and why you're happy for
my daughter and I to be staying

1150
01:05:47,816 --> 01:05:49,249
at a flophouse full of freaks

1151
01:05:49,349 --> 01:05:50,885
while I continue
to pay you rent!

1152
01:05:50,984 --> 01:05:54,087
And I have a very, very,
very important patient

1153
01:05:54,188 --> 01:05:55,924
that is a prominent lawyer,
and I am not afraid to--

1154
01:05:58,860 --> 01:05:59,993
Fuck!

1155
01:06:04,231 --> 01:06:07,301
I was after some
Visa gift cards.

1156
01:06:07,401 --> 01:06:10,003
Uh, what denominations
do you have?

1157
01:06:10,638 --> 01:06:12,807
Do you have a minute to talk
before the children come out?

1158
01:06:12,907 --> 01:06:14,274
-Mm-hm. Sure.
-Okay, come.

1159
01:06:18,011 --> 01:06:20,682
So, I've noticed that you still
haven't made the appointment

1160
01:06:20,782 --> 01:06:22,951
for family therapy like
we discussed the other morning.

1161
01:06:23,050 --> 01:06:25,620
I know. It's just been
so crazy at work.

1162
01:06:25,720 --> 01:06:29,189
Right. So I can't stress to you
enough how important this is.

1163
01:06:30,090 --> 01:06:31,860
I'm on your side here.

1164
01:06:31,960 --> 01:06:33,695
Yes. Yes. Yes, I understand.

1165
01:06:33,795 --> 01:06:35,864
We need her off the machine.

1166
01:06:36,129 --> 01:06:37,197
Yeah, so do I.

1167
01:06:37,297 --> 01:06:38,833
Okay. I'm gonna be frank.

1168
01:06:38,933 --> 01:06:42,002
We need her off of it as soon as
possible for her to remain here.

1169
01:06:42,102 --> 01:06:44,438
And to do that, she needs
to gain faster.

1170
01:06:44,539 --> 01:06:47,174
Okay. Well, but we have
until next week, right?

1171
01:06:47,274 --> 01:06:48,977
-The 50 pound goal.
-No.

1172
01:06:49,076 --> 01:06:52,547
The way things are going, uh,
she's not gonna make that goal.

1173
01:06:53,648 --> 01:06:55,215
What are you saying?

1174
01:06:55,415 --> 01:06:57,986
We do weigh-ins every morning.
She's not gonna make the goal.

1175
01:06:58,085 --> 01:06:59,687
Because the goal you set
was impossible.

1176
01:06:59,787 --> 01:07:01,188
We were set up to fail.

1177
01:07:01,288 --> 01:07:02,524
-It's unrealistic.
-No.

1178
01:07:03,658 --> 01:07:06,528
We're gonna have to reassess
the level of care.

1179
01:07:07,996 --> 01:07:09,129
What does that mean?

1180
01:07:09,229 --> 01:07:11,265
Well, we can discuss
it in our meeting.

1181
01:07:11,933 --> 01:07:15,502
You know what I would love,
and think would be so good,

1182
01:07:15,603 --> 01:07:19,908
is if we could get a date
on the calendar for the surgery.

1183
01:07:20,240 --> 01:07:22,977
A concrete goal that we can
all work towards.

1184
01:07:23,076 --> 01:07:25,312
It's not... it's not a surgery.

1185
01:07:25,479 --> 01:07:28,816
The tube removal? Well, uh...
procedure, whatever you call it.

1186
01:07:28,917 --> 01:07:30,919
It's not a procedure either.

1187
01:07:31,019 --> 01:07:34,254
Uh, when it's time to remove it,
the doctor just pulls it out.

1188
01:07:38,058 --> 01:07:39,226
Pull it out?

1189
01:07:40,028 --> 01:07:41,328
Yeah, it just slides out.

1190
01:07:42,296 --> 01:07:44,799
They could just...
really just pull it out?

1191
01:07:44,899 --> 01:07:46,366
Yeah, it's that simple.

1192
01:07:46,466 --> 01:07:49,938
Oh. But what happens
to the hole?

1193
01:07:50,038 --> 01:07:52,740
It closes up on its own.

1194
01:07:52,840 --> 01:07:54,308
Oh.

1195
01:07:54,676 --> 01:07:57,579
It's kinda like when you
get a cut on your tongue.

1196
01:07:58,312 --> 01:08:00,447
It wants to close up.

1197
01:08:02,750 --> 01:08:03,618
Oh.

1198
01:08:09,423 --> 01:08:10,390
Yeah?

1199
01:08:13,327 --> 01:08:15,630
Oh, hi. Uh, is James here?

1200
01:08:17,932 --> 01:08:18,866
Who are you?

1201
01:08:21,234 --> 01:08:25,105
I'm his neighbor.
I'm there, in that room there.

1202
01:08:26,273 --> 01:08:27,441
He is not here.

1203
01:08:27,542 --> 01:08:29,443
Oh, uh, do you know when
he'll be back?

1204
01:08:29,544 --> 01:08:31,646
I just have something
to give him.

1205
01:08:31,946 --> 01:08:32,880
Give it to me.

1206
01:08:32,981 --> 01:08:34,181
-I'll see he gets it.
-No, no.

1207
01:08:34,281 --> 01:08:36,249
I have to give it
to him myself. It's, uh...

1208
01:08:37,785 --> 01:08:38,853
It's of value.

1209
01:08:40,521 --> 01:08:41,421
Of value?

1210
01:08:42,957 --> 01:08:45,459
Uh, yeah. Of value.

1211
01:08:56,169 --> 01:08:57,204
<i>Relax your body.</i>

1212
01:08:59,974 --> 01:09:01,441
<i>Center in with yourself.</i>

1213
01:09:06,714 --> 01:09:09,216
<i>Right now, your only</i>
<i>job is to breathe.</i>

1214
01:09:12,053 --> 01:09:13,588
<i>We're in the work phase</i>
<i>of this...</i>

1215
01:09:15,623 --> 01:09:17,859
<i>The more you relax</i>
<i>your body right now...</i>

1216
01:09:19,060 --> 01:09:20,762
<i>...the easier it gets for you.</i>

1217
01:09:22,930 --> 01:09:27,635
<i>Recognize we're accessing</i>
<i>the body's wisdom zone.</i>

1218
01:09:27,735 --> 01:09:29,169
<i>Let your mind go.</i>

1219
01:09:30,772 --> 01:09:33,407
<i>See if you can find</i>
<i>your attention</i>

1220
01:09:33,508 --> 01:09:36,176
<i>within the movement</i>
<i>of your breath.</i>

1221
01:09:36,611 --> 01:09:37,377
<i>Start noticing</i>

1222
01:09:37,477 --> 01:09:39,212
<i>any sensation in your body...</i>

1223
01:09:41,115 --> 01:09:43,183
<i>...and see what catches</i>
<i>your interest</i>

1224
01:09:43,283 --> 01:09:45,419
<i>or your curiosity,</i>

1225
01:09:45,887 --> 01:09:49,189
<i>and hold the space</i>
<i>in a way you want to be held.</i>

1226
01:09:49,289 --> 01:09:50,558
<i>You'll probably notice</i>

1227
01:09:50,658 --> 01:09:54,729
<i>any intensity</i>
<i>builds up in your body.</i>

1228
01:09:55,063 --> 01:09:56,597
<i>That's okay.</i>

1229
01:09:56,931 --> 01:09:59,567
<i>Rather than trying</i>
<i>to control anything,</i>

1230
01:10:00,467 --> 01:10:02,737
<i>see if you can just allow...</i>

1231
01:10:03,037 --> 01:10:04,371
<i>the intensity to...</i>

1232
01:10:13,648 --> 01:10:15,183
<i>You're not helping!</i>

1233
01:10:15,282 --> 01:10:17,250
<i>Hold her legs that way.</i>
<i>Hold her legs down.</i>

1234
01:10:19,854 --> 01:10:21,221
<i>We might have to restrain her.</i>

1235
01:10:21,321 --> 01:10:22,690
<i>-Mom!</i>
<i>-Hold her down!</i>

1236
01:10:22,790 --> 01:10:24,491
<i>You're here</i>
<i>to help us, come on!</i>

1237
01:10:24,592 --> 01:10:26,293
<i>That's not helping at all.</i>

1238
01:10:31,999 --> 01:10:33,868
<i>Mommy!</i>

1239
01:10:33,968 --> 01:10:35,670
<i>Mommy!</i>

1240
01:10:35,770 --> 01:10:37,270
<i>Try to help.</i>
<i>Try to help.</i>

1241
01:10:37,370 --> 01:10:38,840
<i>Mommy!</i>

1242
01:10:47,014 --> 01:10:48,883
<i>Make yourself feel safe.</i>

1243
01:10:48,983 --> 01:10:50,718
<i>If things are getting intense,</i>

1244
01:10:50,818 --> 01:10:53,221
<i>recognize</i>
<i>you can hold the space.</i>

1245
01:10:53,320 --> 01:10:55,255
<i>You can love yourself</i>
<i>right now.</i>

1246
01:10:58,425 --> 01:11:02,462
<i>Don't avoid anything within.</i>
<i>Don't abandon yourself.</i>

1247
01:11:02,563 --> 01:11:04,198
<i>Stay connected to yourself.</i>

1248
01:11:04,297 --> 01:11:06,234
<i>See if you can honor yourself</i>

1249
01:11:06,333 --> 01:11:10,071
<i>in this moment</i>
<i>of reconnecting to yourself.</i>

1250
01:11:23,217 --> 01:11:27,420
<i>Use your voice</i>
<i>and imagine your emotion.</i>

1251
01:11:27,989 --> 01:11:29,289
<i>Allow it to be...</i>

1252
01:11:29,590 --> 01:11:31,659
Maybe you can even
do it tonight.

1253
01:11:41,135 --> 01:11:42,537
Down here. This way.

1254
01:11:56,818 --> 01:11:58,553
It's in here. Here.

1255
01:12:03,224 --> 01:12:06,060
Okay, we gotta be quick because
I have to get back, but...

1256
01:12:06,160 --> 01:12:10,598
I just... I just had to show
someone what's going on in here.

1257
01:12:10,965 --> 01:12:12,834
Okay.

1258
01:12:13,534 --> 01:12:17,171
So, a room filled
with plastic tarp everywhere.

1259
01:12:17,271 --> 01:12:18,371
Nice.

1260
01:12:18,471 --> 01:12:20,208
So, is this your kill room?

1261
01:12:20,308 --> 01:12:22,109
No. Come on, I told you.

1262
01:12:22,210 --> 01:12:23,945
The fucking ceiling fell down.

1263
01:12:25,046 --> 01:12:26,446
What the fuck is that?

1264
01:12:26,881 --> 01:12:28,182
That's it. That's the hole.

1265
01:12:28,282 --> 01:12:29,617
That's why I'm at the hotel.

1266
01:12:29,717 --> 01:12:31,351
That's why you're
staying at the fucking hotel?

1267
01:12:31,451 --> 01:12:32,753
Oh, my God. Come on.

1268
01:12:32,854 --> 01:12:35,723
You could've slept on your couch
for a couple of weeks.

1269
01:12:35,823 --> 01:12:36,991
What? Look at it.

1270
01:12:37,091 --> 01:12:39,727
It's been two months,
and they refuse to fix it.

1271
01:12:39,827 --> 01:12:43,931
There's dust and...
and mold everywhere.

1272
01:12:44,031 --> 01:12:45,398
Mm.

1273
01:12:56,344 --> 01:12:58,946
Yo, what is up there?

1274
01:13:00,681 --> 01:13:02,750
They've been
renovating forever.

1275
01:13:03,918 --> 01:13:06,287
-They said a pipe burst.
-Oh, shit.

1276
01:13:06,453 --> 01:13:09,957
It's right there. There you go.

1277
01:13:10,057 --> 01:13:13,728
I did the... that... you know,
the thing, the breath thing.

1278
01:13:13,828 --> 01:13:14,762
What?

1279
01:13:14,862 --> 01:13:16,564
And I think it took me here.

1280
01:13:16,664 --> 01:13:18,599
-I think maybe I...
-Oh, man...

1281
01:13:18,699 --> 01:13:20,234
That's why I wanted
to come to see it.

1282
01:13:20,334 --> 01:13:22,103
Man, you need guidance
with that shit.

1283
01:13:22,203 --> 01:13:24,372
You can't just be doing that.

1284
01:13:25,139 --> 01:13:27,608
-What are you doing?
-Man, they lied to you, sis.

1285
01:13:27,708 --> 01:13:28,809
It ain't even no pipes in here.

1286
01:13:28,910 --> 01:13:30,144
Maybe you shouldn't
get so close to it.

1287
01:13:30,244 --> 01:13:32,213
Shh. Look. Come see.

1288
01:13:32,613 --> 01:13:34,248
It's a clean break.
I'm telling you.

1289
01:13:34,348 --> 01:13:35,716
Oh, my God.

1290
01:13:36,083 --> 01:13:38,019
Oh, my God. What the fuck?

1291
01:13:38,119 --> 01:13:41,421
Man, my cousin Craig
is a general contractor.

1292
01:13:41,522 --> 01:13:43,524
He knows somebody
that knows somebody that can

1293
01:13:43,624 --> 01:13:45,359
-fix this shit in a jiffy, yo.
-Oh, my God.

1294
01:13:45,593 --> 01:13:46,794
It look like you got some

1295
01:13:46,894 --> 01:13:48,596
motherfucking debris
on your furniture.

1296
01:13:48,696 --> 01:13:50,564
You know, I can reupholster it.

1297
01:13:50,665 --> 01:13:51,565
It's gonna cost you.

1298
01:13:53,466 --> 01:13:55,136
<i>Let me go!</i>

1299
01:14:06,747 --> 01:14:08,149
<i>Don't touch me!</i>

1300
01:14:14,922 --> 01:14:16,691
Mommy! Mommy! I don't want it!

1301
01:14:16,791 --> 01:14:18,693
-You are doing such a good job.
-No!

1302
01:14:19,927 --> 01:14:22,096
No! Mommy!

1303
01:14:22,930 --> 01:14:25,066
You gotta hold her
a lot harder than that.

1304
01:14:26,100 --> 01:14:28,803
No! No!

1305
01:14:40,881 --> 01:14:43,117
What the fuck?!
Oh, shit!

1306
01:14:44,218 --> 01:14:47,021
Oh, fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

1307
01:14:49,957 --> 01:14:52,126
Fuck! Oh, fuck!

1308
01:14:52,226 --> 01:14:54,528
James?

1309
01:14:57,531 --> 01:15:00,634
Ah! Fuck! Fuck!

1310
01:15:03,404 --> 01:15:04,171
Fuck!

1311
01:15:05,873 --> 01:15:06,807
Oh, fuck!

1312
01:15:07,408 --> 01:15:08,776
Oh, fuck!

1313
01:15:26,460 --> 01:15:29,163
Everybody settle. All right?

1314
01:15:29,730 --> 01:15:32,366
Get started.
Hand out these, please.

1315
01:15:32,466 --> 01:15:33,968
Thank you.

1316
01:15:35,936 --> 01:15:37,304
All right.

1317
01:15:39,373 --> 01:15:44,513
So the topic today is something
that's so fundamental

1318
01:15:44,612 --> 01:15:47,415
that it's actually
a little silly to talk about.

1319
01:15:47,748 --> 01:15:52,286
But it is so important
to your child's recovery,

1320
01:15:52,386 --> 01:15:53,921
and more than that,

1321
01:15:54,021 --> 01:15:57,591
to your ability
to help your child recover.

1322
01:15:57,958 --> 01:16:00,027
Can anybody guess what it is?

1323
01:16:02,463 --> 01:16:04,365
Blame...

1324
01:16:04,765 --> 01:16:06,901
-...and, anybody?
-Shame.

1325
01:16:07,001 --> 01:16:08,502
Yeah, thank you.

1326
01:16:09,970 --> 01:16:12,673
So, as parents, a lot of times

1327
01:16:12,773 --> 01:16:16,110
we look too
closely at ourselves, right?

1328
01:16:16,210 --> 01:16:19,548
And we start to ask ourselves,
is this my fault?

1329
01:16:19,647 --> 01:16:21,582
Could I have done anything
differently?

1330
01:16:21,882 --> 01:16:23,984
What if this? What if that?

1331
01:16:24,085 --> 01:16:28,456
But all it does is create
a thinking trap.

1332
01:16:30,024 --> 01:16:33,294
And that does not
help your child.

1333
01:16:33,761 --> 01:16:36,797
So what I'd like to
do, if we look...

1334
01:16:38,199 --> 01:16:39,733
Melanie...

1335
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:41,802
do you want to put some
words to your feelings?

1336
01:16:43,137 --> 01:16:44,238
Yeah.

1337
01:16:45,372 --> 01:16:46,707
I...

1338
01:16:46,807 --> 01:16:50,611
Sometimes, I just think
that it is all my fault.

1339
01:16:55,916 --> 01:16:57,785
Do you have something
to say to Melanie?

1340
01:16:59,453 --> 01:17:02,189
No. Whoa, no.

1341
01:17:02,289 --> 01:17:04,391
Never mind. Don't mind me.

1342
01:17:04,859 --> 01:17:07,027
No, no, no. I want to hear
what you have to say.

1343
01:17:11,132 --> 01:17:12,299
Uh...

1344
01:17:12,399 --> 01:17:15,703
I just-- You keep telling us
that it isn't our fault.

1345
01:17:15,803 --> 01:17:18,139
-Yeah.
-Mm. But... but it is.

1346
01:17:20,174 --> 01:17:21,475
Excuse me?

1347
01:17:21,576 --> 01:17:23,811
I mean, if it isn't our fault,
then we're really super fucked.

1348
01:17:23,911 --> 01:17:25,079
We're just walking around
pretending

1349
01:17:25,179 --> 01:17:26,780
we have power
to change something

1350
01:17:26,881 --> 01:17:28,983
that we don't even understand
because it's not our fault,

1351
01:17:29,083 --> 01:17:31,886
but we know how to change it,
even though it's not our fault.

1352
01:17:31,986 --> 01:17:33,320
No, this is actually good.

1353
01:17:33,420 --> 01:17:35,256
This is actually good because
now we have a lot to unpack.

1354
01:17:35,356 --> 01:17:36,657
No, no, no. I know.

1355
01:17:36,757 --> 01:17:37,858
I can't do this. I have to go.

1356
01:17:37,958 --> 01:17:39,561
-Please sit down.
-No, no, no. It's our fault.

1357
01:17:39,693 --> 01:17:40,828
It isn't fair,
but it is our fault.

1358
01:17:40,928 --> 01:17:42,564
That's how I see it. That's it.

1359
01:17:42,663 --> 01:17:44,566
That's what this whole
thing is, is our faults.

1360
01:17:44,665 --> 01:17:46,601
-Stop and sit down.
-No, no, no.

1361
01:17:46,700 --> 01:17:47,902
No, I don't want
to talk about it.

1362
01:17:48,002 --> 01:17:49,870
I already know it,
and I don't have to meet you

1363
01:17:49,970 --> 01:17:51,305
because I know what
you're going to say,

1364
01:17:51,405 --> 01:17:52,806
-which is that she's failed...
-I need you to sit down!

1365
01:17:52,907 --> 01:17:55,876
...and that I failed
because you set us up to fail.

1366
01:17:55,976 --> 01:17:57,579
No one tries hard
if they have a safety net.

1367
01:17:57,678 --> 01:17:59,648
-Sit down.
-Nobody, okay?

1368
01:17:59,747 --> 01:18:01,015
And you should know
that, Dr. Spring.

1369
01:18:01,115 --> 01:18:02,683
I'm gonna be here
for the rest of my life

1370
01:18:02,783 --> 01:18:04,218
pouring shit down that tube.

1371
01:18:04,318 --> 01:18:07,087
-Every night until I die.
-Do not leave that door!

1372
01:18:07,188 --> 01:18:10,124
And none of this is helping
any of us. None of it.

1373
01:18:10,224 --> 01:18:11,125
Come back!

1374
01:18:13,394 --> 01:18:15,162
<i>Hey!</i>
<i>Hey, why are you calling?</i>

1375
01:18:15,262 --> 01:18:16,964
<i>Isn't a parent group</i>
<i>going on right now?</i>

1376
01:18:17,064 --> 01:18:18,832
<i>I couldn't sit there.</i>
<i>I'm in the car.</i>

1377
01:18:18,933 --> 01:18:20,801
<i>I'll pick her up later,</i>
<i>but I can't stay there.</i>

1378
01:18:20,901 --> 01:18:22,036
<i>What do you mean</i>
<i>you couldn't sit there?</i>

1379
01:18:22,136 --> 01:18:23,605
<i>I can't do it.</i>
<i>I can't do it.</i>

1380
01:18:23,704 --> 01:18:25,940
<i>She's gotta get better, but</i>
<i>she's not gonna make the goal,</i>

1381
01:18:26,040 --> 01:18:28,075
<i>and I-- I don't know</i>
<i>what's gonna happen now.</i>

1382
01:18:28,175 --> 01:18:29,910
<i>You need</i>
<i>to get back in there.</i>

1383
01:18:30,010 --> 01:18:31,078
<i>The hole is getting bigger.</i>

1384
01:18:31,178 --> 01:18:32,913
<i>What hole?</i>
<i>Her tube hole?</i>

1385
01:18:33,013 --> 01:18:35,149
-No! No, the apartment hole!
<i>-You told me--</i>

1386
01:18:35,249 --> 01:18:36,685
The goddamn hole!

1387
01:18:36,784 --> 01:18:38,786
<i>Why can't you just keep tabs</i>
<i>on those guys?</i>

1388
01:18:38,886 --> 01:18:40,689
Because the guy's gone
for a week.

1389
01:18:40,788 --> 01:18:42,389
There's no one working on it.

1390
01:18:42,489 --> 01:18:44,458
<i>What?! A week?! When</i>
<i>were you gonna mention that?</i>

1391
01:18:44,559 --> 01:18:45,826
I'm telling you now.

1392
01:18:45,926 --> 01:18:47,061
It's very complicated
to explain over the phone.

1393
01:18:47,161 --> 01:18:48,495
<i>Look, look, look. No, no, no.</i>

1394
01:18:48,597 --> 01:18:49,763
<i>Just-- just</i>

1395
01:18:49,863 --> 01:18:51,131
<i>-send me pictures...</i>
-No!

1396
01:18:51,232 --> 01:18:52,567
<i>...and I'll have somebody</i>
<i>take care of it.</i>

1397
01:18:52,667 --> 01:18:54,134
No, no, no. No more pictures.
I'm not going back there.

1398
01:18:54,235 --> 01:18:55,537
I'm never going back there.
And I talked to Roscoe...

1399
01:18:55,637 --> 01:18:58,105
<i>-What are you talking about?</i>
-...and he's so full of shit.

1400
01:18:58,205 --> 01:19:00,040
He's not doing anything.
And by the way,

1401
01:19:00,140 --> 01:19:03,344
I think he has a deal with the
motel because there's another--

1402
01:19:03,444 --> 01:19:07,381
<i>Okay. Stop, stop, stop, okay?</i>
<i>Let me just get this straight.</i>

1403
01:19:07,481 --> 01:19:09,517
<i>You aren't going into</i>
<i>the program anymore,</i>

1404
01:19:09,618 --> 01:19:11,919
<i>and you aren't going</i>
<i>into our apartment anymore?</i>

1405
01:19:12,019 --> 01:19:14,689
-That's right.
<i>-Why?</i>

1406
01:19:14,989 --> 01:19:17,791
<i>How do you expect anything</i>
<i>to get back to normal then?</i>

1407
01:19:18,759 --> 01:19:20,060
It won't.

1408
01:19:20,160 --> 01:19:22,096
<i>What are you talking about?!</i>

1409
01:19:22,196 --> 01:19:23,464
It won't!

1410
01:19:26,500 --> 01:19:28,402
<i>All right. Are you...</i>

1411
01:19:28,502 --> 01:19:30,672
<i>are you in your right mind now?</i>
<i>Are you done?</i>

1412
01:19:30,771 --> 01:19:32,906
Also, there's a woman missing.

1413
01:19:33,407 --> 01:19:35,510
<i>What? Who? What are you...</i>
<i>Who's missing?</i>

1414
01:19:35,610 --> 01:19:37,011
My patient. She's missing.

1415
01:19:37,111 --> 01:19:38,879
She left and she's not picking
up her phone, and she's--

1416
01:19:38,979 --> 01:19:42,149
<i>Oh, okay. Okay.</i>
<i>Yeah, let's take a deep breath.</i>

1417
01:19:42,249 --> 01:19:44,084
<i>-Start from the beginning.</i>
-No, no, no.

1418
01:19:44,184 --> 01:19:45,919
I can't talk to you about this.

1419
01:19:46,020 --> 01:19:47,921
<i>Why aren't you going</i>
<i>back into the group?</i>

1420
01:19:48,022 --> 01:19:49,591
I'll just talk to
my therapist later. I-- This--

1421
01:19:49,691 --> 01:19:50,725
This is fine.
Everything's fine.

1422
01:19:50,824 --> 01:19:51,825
<i>Hey, hey.</i>
<i>Slow down. Slow down.</i>

1423
01:19:51,925 --> 01:19:53,227
Everything's fine.

1424
01:19:53,327 --> 01:19:54,828
<i>How many times a week</i>
<i>do you see that guy?</i>

1425
01:19:54,928 --> 01:19:56,063
<i>I just looked in the bank</i>
<i>accounts. How often--</i>

1426
01:19:56,163 --> 01:19:59,967
-Every day. Every day.
<i>-Every day?! Come on!</i>

1427
01:20:00,067 --> 01:20:01,603
-Hold on. Hold on. Hold on.
<i>-That's costing us a fortune!</i>

1428
01:20:01,703 --> 01:20:06,340
No sitting idle in vehicles.
Please move the car or yourself.

1429
01:20:06,440 --> 01:20:10,210
I have a right to sit in my car
without you harassing me!

1430
01:20:10,311 --> 01:20:10,978
<i>-What</i>
-Yeah.

1431
01:20:11,078 --> 01:20:12,146
<i>Are you talking to somebody?</i>

1432
01:20:12,246 --> 01:20:13,615
Yeah,
there's this creepy asshole

1433
01:20:13,715 --> 01:20:15,750
who's harassing me
every fucking day!

1434
01:20:15,849 --> 01:20:17,217
He harasses me.
He's obsessed with me.

1435
01:20:17,318 --> 01:20:19,053
He's back at my window
wanting something!

1436
01:20:19,153 --> 01:20:20,287
<i>What are you talking about?</i>

1437
01:20:20,387 --> 01:20:21,589
Are you going to leave
the parking lot

1438
01:20:21,690 --> 01:20:22,590
or get out of your car!

1439
01:20:22,691 --> 01:20:24,191
Oh, my God! Are you serious?

1440
01:20:24,291 --> 01:20:26,594
-I will call the police!
-Oh, my God! Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1441
01:20:26,695 --> 01:20:27,995
-Call the police.
-Move!

1442
01:20:28,095 --> 01:20:29,330
Call the police. Yeah, I'm gonna
call the police on you!

1443
01:20:29,430 --> 01:20:30,831
I never want
to see you here again!

1444
01:20:30,931 --> 01:20:32,032
Oh, my God!

1445
01:20:32,132 --> 01:20:33,834
You're harass--
This is harassment!

1446
01:21:02,062 --> 01:21:05,366
Anything in particular
keeping you silent right now?

1447
01:21:08,035 --> 01:21:10,572
The fact that I want to be
silent is keeping me silent.

1448
01:21:11,872 --> 01:21:13,941
-I think--
-This isn't about you.

1449
01:21:16,544 --> 01:21:18,813
What I mean is I--

1450
01:21:18,912 --> 01:21:20,981
I mean, I pay for your time.

1451
01:21:21,081 --> 01:21:25,219
Right? So I can do
anything I want with that time,

1452
01:21:25,319 --> 01:21:28,021
and right now...

1453
01:21:30,057 --> 01:21:34,027
I just want to lay here
without you talking.

1454
01:21:34,128 --> 01:21:36,531
Well, you did not have to
come here for that.

1455
01:21:37,599 --> 01:21:39,400
Go lie on your own couch.

1456
01:21:41,301 --> 01:21:44,204
Do you wish I lied on my own
couch instead of coming here?

1457
01:21:44,639 --> 01:21:48,543
All I'm saying is
you chose not to be alone.

1458
01:21:50,512 --> 01:21:51,679
Oh, I'm alone.

1459
01:21:52,647 --> 01:21:56,016
No, you're not alone. I'm here.

1460
01:21:56,383 --> 01:21:58,919
But no, you aren't. Not really.

1461
01:21:59,019 --> 01:22:01,155
-What we can do--
-Can we just not?

1462
01:22:01,989 --> 01:22:03,257
Seriously.

1463
01:22:08,663 --> 01:22:09,798
Okay.

1464
01:22:10,130 --> 01:22:11,465
Do you know what?

1465
01:22:11,566 --> 01:22:15,235
Did I ever tell you
that I was pregnant before?

1466
01:22:15,703 --> 01:22:17,639
Like, I've been pregnant twice.

1467
01:22:22,811 --> 01:22:24,712
I never tell anyone this.

1468
01:22:27,247 --> 01:22:30,317
It was when Charles and I
were first dating and, um...

1469
01:22:35,155 --> 01:22:37,725
I got an abortion
right away, like...

1470
01:22:37,826 --> 01:22:39,193
I took a pregnancy test

1471
01:22:39,293 --> 01:22:43,096
and then just went to
a random clinic the next day.

1472
01:22:45,567 --> 01:22:49,537
I got the surgical kind
with the vacuum thing.

1473
01:22:51,438 --> 01:22:52,574
And it...

1474
01:22:54,041 --> 01:22:55,976
hurt really badly, like...

1475
01:22:58,546 --> 01:23:00,481
A nurse held my hand.

1476
01:23:03,818 --> 01:23:05,185
And for some reason,

1477
01:23:05,285 --> 01:23:07,454
I didn't realize
how badly it would hurt but...

1478
01:23:09,389 --> 01:23:11,124
...it really did.

1479
01:23:15,128 --> 01:23:17,966
Yeah, it was almost
20 years ago.

1480
01:23:18,666 --> 01:23:21,669
I'd have a kid in college
by now if I hadn't done that.

1481
01:23:36,584 --> 01:23:39,754
Maybe I got rid
of the wrong one.

1482
01:23:44,291 --> 01:23:46,661
Why won't you say anything?

1483
01:23:49,096 --> 01:23:50,665
I can't breathe.

1484
01:23:56,169 --> 01:23:58,405
You don't get it.
You don't see.

1485
01:24:00,575 --> 01:24:04,211
You... you love to tell me
I don't get it.

1486
01:24:04,411 --> 01:24:06,614
What is it you think
I don't get?

1487
01:24:06,881 --> 01:24:09,684
What is it you're so sure...

1488
01:24:09,951 --> 01:24:11,920
I can't help you with?

1489
01:24:12,219 --> 01:24:15,322
I'm one of those people that's
not supposed to be a mom.

1490
01:24:18,760 --> 01:24:20,995
I'm not a mom. I'm not.

1491
01:24:21,128 --> 01:24:22,496
This isn't supposed to be
what it's like.

1492
01:24:22,597 --> 01:24:25,332
This isn't it.
This can't be it.

1493
01:24:28,101 --> 01:24:30,237
Will you say something?!

1494
01:24:33,340 --> 01:24:35,375
Not everyone can do it.
I can't...

1495
01:24:39,714 --> 01:24:41,616
Do you have any kids?

1496
01:24:44,919 --> 01:24:47,087
Do you have a kid!?

1497
01:24:49,256 --> 01:24:52,159
Hello!

1498
01:24:54,361 --> 01:24:57,832
Why won't you talk to me?!
Why won't you help me?!

1499
01:25:01,435 --> 01:25:03,538
I know what you're doing...

1500
01:25:04,471 --> 01:25:06,106
...and I can't have it.

1501
01:25:07,976 --> 01:25:09,777
What am I doing?

1502
01:25:13,681 --> 01:25:14,649
This isn't working.

1503
01:25:16,784 --> 01:25:18,218
What do you mean?

1504
01:25:19,988 --> 01:25:22,757
We can't see
each other anymore.

1505
01:25:57,859 --> 01:25:59,627
I got here early.

1506
01:26:00,528 --> 01:26:02,630
You'll have to wait outside.

1507
01:26:14,207 --> 01:26:15,677
<i>Uh, look,</i>

1508
01:26:15,777 --> 01:26:16,678
<i>I don't know why</i>
<i>you aren't answering your cell,</i>

1509
01:26:16,778 --> 01:26:19,013
<i>but Dr. Spring called and--</i>

1510
01:26:19,113 --> 01:26:20,648
<i>It's Dr. Spring.</i>

1511
01:26:20,748 --> 01:26:22,784
<i>You cannot bring your daughter</i>
<i>here for further treatment</i>

1512
01:26:22,884 --> 01:26:24,752
<i>until we have--</i>

1513
01:26:24,852 --> 01:26:27,121
<i>You are too much, you know?</i>

1514
01:26:27,220 --> 01:26:28,690
<i>You are... I'm gonna--</i>

1515
01:26:28,790 --> 01:26:30,190
<i>Hey, thanks for checking in.</i>

1516
01:26:30,290 --> 01:26:31,626
<i>In case you forgot,</i>

1517
01:26:31,726 --> 01:26:33,360
<i>my wife still happens</i>
<i>to be fucking missing.</i>

1518
01:26:33,460 --> 01:26:34,829
<i>You know, I don't know</i>
<i>what kind of number--</i>

1519
01:26:40,668 --> 01:26:41,969
What the fuck?

1520
01:26:47,340 --> 01:26:48,810
<i>You...</i>

1521
01:26:48,910 --> 01:26:51,746
<i>You mentioned</i>
<i>an aphorism from the Bible</i>

1522
01:26:51,846 --> 01:26:54,448
<i>about a millstone.</i>
<i>Would you say what that is?</i>

1523
01:26:54,882 --> 01:26:58,385
<i>That it's better to tie a stone</i>
<i>around your neck</i>

1524
01:26:58,485 --> 01:27:00,788
<i>and throw yourself into the sea</i>

1525
01:27:00,888 --> 01:27:04,826
<i>than to cause anyone</i>
<i>to stumble-- stumble.</i>

1526
01:27:05,593 --> 01:27:06,894
<i>All right, let me</i>
<i>make sure I'm getting that.</i>

1527
01:27:06,994 --> 01:27:08,930
<i>It's better to tie a millstone</i>
<i>around your neck</i>

1528
01:27:09,030 --> 01:27:12,834
<i>and throw yourself in the sea</i>
<i>rather than to do what?</i>

1529
01:27:13,300 --> 01:27:15,803
<i>Cause someone</i>
<i>to stumble. Stumble.</i>

1530
01:27:15,903 --> 01:27:19,239
<i>To cause</i>
<i>someone to stumble? Okay.</i>

1531
01:27:19,507 --> 01:27:21,475
<i>What were you trying</i>
<i>to accomplish there</i>

1532
01:27:21,576 --> 01:27:24,112
<i>when you did take your</i>
<i>children's lives?</i>

1533
01:27:35,322 --> 01:27:37,892
...all women,
all Gen Z group think.

1534
01:27:39,259 --> 01:27:40,628
Like, what are your thoughts?

1535
01:27:45,566 --> 01:27:46,901
And?

1536
01:27:48,335 --> 01:27:49,670
Hello?

1537
01:27:49,971 --> 01:27:52,006
Yeah. Mm-hm. Mm-hm.

1538
01:27:52,106 --> 01:27:53,306
Mm-hm.

1539
01:27:53,406 --> 01:27:55,743
That is totally
unbelievable, right?

1540
01:27:56,844 --> 01:28:00,548
That's completely unbelievable.
All of it.

1541
01:28:00,648 --> 01:28:03,718
-But Dr. Spring said--
-I don't care what she said.

1542
01:28:03,818 --> 01:28:04,886
I'm telling you,

1543
01:28:04,986 --> 01:28:08,689
I had a work emergency
and I couldn't stay.

1544
01:28:08,790 --> 01:28:11,458
I had to leave.
It isn't my fault.

1545
01:28:11,559 --> 01:28:13,594
I came right back to pick you up
when I was supposed to

1546
01:28:13,694 --> 01:28:16,363
like I always do.
I just-- I just--

1547
01:28:16,664 --> 01:28:20,134
I just couldn't stay
for the group, but, you know...

1548
01:28:20,234 --> 01:28:21,501
I work with
a lot of very sick people,

1549
01:28:21,602 --> 01:28:24,238
-honey, and sometimes they are--
-Sicker than me?

1550
01:28:24,806 --> 01:28:27,809
Sick in a different
way than you.

1551
01:28:28,475 --> 01:28:30,945
-But Dr. Spring said--
-I told you,

1552
01:28:31,045 --> 01:28:33,214
I don't care what she said.

1553
01:28:33,313 --> 01:28:34,381
I'm your mother.

1554
01:28:34,481 --> 01:28:37,652
She loves me though.
She said so.

1555
01:28:39,153 --> 01:28:40,688
She said that?

1556
01:28:40,788 --> 01:28:42,990
She loves all of us. The kids.

1557
01:28:43,090 --> 01:28:46,294
She has no right to
tell you that. She's a doctor.

1558
01:28:46,393 --> 01:28:48,596
-She doesn't have a right--
-It's true, though!

1559
01:28:48,696 --> 01:28:50,865
You know, I don't think we need
the program anymore.

1560
01:28:50,965 --> 01:28:53,768
-I'm better?
-Yeah. I think maybe, yeah.

1561
01:28:53,868 --> 01:28:55,303
Maybe we...

1562
01:28:55,402 --> 01:28:57,004
we just do it, you and me.

1563
01:28:57,939 --> 01:28:59,574
What would happen?

1564
01:29:00,975 --> 01:29:04,812
Uh... So many
wonderful things. You would...

1565
01:29:05,880 --> 01:29:07,380
You'd be able
to get the tube out,

1566
01:29:07,480 --> 01:29:08,783
and you could go back to school

1567
01:29:08,883 --> 01:29:11,351
and you'd be eating everything
delicious in the whole word.

1568
01:29:11,451 --> 01:29:13,588
Wouldn't that be great?

1569
01:29:13,921 --> 01:29:15,523
You can do that?

1570
01:29:16,389 --> 01:29:17,859
Do what?

1571
01:29:17,959 --> 01:29:21,162
Make me better?
I won't need the machine?

1572
01:29:21,529 --> 01:29:22,964
Well...

1573
01:29:23,664 --> 01:29:25,066
I'm better? They said that?

1574
01:29:25,166 --> 01:29:26,701
I think, maybe.

1575
01:29:26,801 --> 01:29:28,368
You know, and...

1576
01:29:28,468 --> 01:29:31,639
And if not, then
we'll just do it, you know?

1577
01:29:31,739 --> 01:29:33,140
You're better than you were,

1578
01:29:33,241 --> 01:29:35,009
and Dr. Spring's
not the boss of us.

1579
01:29:41,349 --> 01:29:42,516
Mommy?

1580
01:29:44,118 --> 01:29:45,052
Yeah?

1581
01:29:46,654 --> 01:29:48,756
I'm really
sorry, but I'm not better.

1582
01:29:48,856 --> 01:29:51,659
Please don't be mad or sad
that I said that.

1583
01:30:15,249 --> 01:30:16,751
Hello?

1584
01:30:17,450 --> 01:30:18,619
<i>There's someone here</i>

1585
01:30:18,719 --> 01:30:20,521
<i>who wants to see you</i>
<i>in the lobby.</i>

1586
01:30:23,557 --> 01:30:25,693
What? Who?

1587
01:30:26,861 --> 01:30:29,897
<i>Won't say. Come down or don't.</i>

1588
01:30:38,172 --> 01:30:40,074
Thanks for checking on me.

1589
01:30:41,709 --> 01:30:44,378
Oh, you would not believe
the day I had, honestly.

1590
01:30:44,477 --> 01:30:46,948
After you just left me
all alone,

1591
01:30:47,048 --> 01:30:48,849
abandoned in your
spooky-ass apartment,

1592
01:30:48,950 --> 01:30:50,051
with my bone sticking
out my leg.

1593
01:30:50,151 --> 01:30:50,918
I called you an ambulance.

1594
01:30:51,018 --> 01:30:52,186
No big deal.

1595
01:30:52,286 --> 01:30:53,087
What else did you expect me
to do?

1596
01:30:53,187 --> 01:30:54,388
It's really painful.

1597
01:30:54,487 --> 01:30:56,590
I had to get back here
to my kid, okay?

1598
01:30:56,691 --> 01:30:58,693
Mother of the fucking year.
I almost forgot.

1599
01:30:59,327 --> 01:31:00,394
I don't care.

1600
01:31:00,493 --> 01:31:02,196
And what exactly
am I supposed to do

1601
01:31:02,296 --> 01:31:03,431
with your brick of cocaine?

1602
01:31:03,531 --> 01:31:04,932
-Flush it.
-Okay.

1603
01:31:05,032 --> 01:31:05,933
It must be nice.

1604
01:31:06,033 --> 01:31:08,035
Why didn't they give
you any crutches?

1605
01:31:08,903 --> 01:31:11,539
Fuck them crutches.

1606
01:31:27,221 --> 01:31:28,923
It's... It is you!

1607
01:31:30,291 --> 01:31:32,059
You-- you're here.

1608
01:31:32,326 --> 01:31:33,861
I hope that's okay.

1609
01:31:33,961 --> 01:31:36,931
I accidentally followed you
this one time, and...

1610
01:31:37,198 --> 01:31:38,532
You live here?

1611
01:31:38,632 --> 01:31:41,501
Are... are you okay?

1612
01:31:42,370 --> 01:31:44,872
-I'm okay.
-Okay. Okay.

1613
01:31:44,972 --> 01:31:46,540
Where did you go?

1614
01:31:46,707 --> 01:31:50,244
I just...
I-- I had to get out of there.

1615
01:31:50,745 --> 01:31:53,914
-Okay, I understand. So, let's--
-Do you?

1616
01:31:54,382 --> 01:31:56,817
Do you really,
really understand?

1617
01:31:57,485 --> 01:31:58,552
I think so.

1618
01:31:59,387 --> 01:32:01,255
Oh, shit. No. This is...

1619
01:32:01,355 --> 01:32:03,024
This is a mistake.

1620
01:32:03,124 --> 01:32:05,659
This is a mistake
because I thought...

1621
01:32:05,926 --> 01:32:07,762
I thought that you understood,

1622
01:32:07,862 --> 01:32:09,296
and that
I wouldn't even have to say--

1623
01:32:09,397 --> 01:32:10,765
Let's calm down.

1624
01:32:10,865 --> 01:32:11,932
I think what we should do
is get in a car right now

1625
01:32:12,033 --> 01:32:13,534
and go straight
to the emergency room.

1626
01:32:13,634 --> 01:32:14,535
A hospital?

1627
01:32:14,635 --> 01:32:16,137
-Yes.
-Why? Why?

1628
01:32:16,237 --> 01:32:17,571
Because
it's just a safe place to go...

1629
01:32:17,671 --> 01:32:18,806
Why? Why? No, I'm fine.

1630
01:32:18,906 --> 01:32:20,741
...if you don't feel ready
to go home.

1631
01:32:20,841 --> 01:32:22,543
Well, what about your daughter?

1632
01:32:23,711 --> 01:32:26,213
-My daughter?
-Where is your daughter?

1633
01:32:26,714 --> 01:32:28,616
She's upstairs. She's sleeping.

1634
01:32:28,716 --> 01:32:29,884
I don't want to go
to a hospital.

1635
01:32:29,984 --> 01:32:30,985
I don't want to
go to a hospital.

1636
01:32:31,085 --> 01:32:31,719
Okay.

1637
01:32:31,819 --> 01:32:33,888
I want you to help me.

1638
01:32:33,988 --> 01:32:34,955
I'm trying to.

1639
01:32:35,056 --> 01:32:36,357
-I am trying to help you.
-Please help me.

1640
01:32:36,457 --> 01:32:37,391
No, no, because you
don't understand.

1641
01:32:37,491 --> 01:32:40,327
You don't see it.
All of their faces.

1642
01:32:40,828 --> 01:32:43,230
Their little faces.
They look at us,

1643
01:32:43,330 --> 01:32:46,467
-and there is nothing there.
-Okay, you need to calm down.

1644
01:32:46,567 --> 01:32:48,436
-No! No!
-You need to calm down.

1645
01:32:48,537 --> 01:32:49,804
No, I am fine! Okay?

1646
01:32:49,904 --> 01:32:51,540
-But I just need you...
-Let's just breathe.

1647
01:32:51,639 --> 01:32:52,573
-No, but you don't know...
-Just breathe.

1648
01:32:52,673 --> 01:32:53,441
In and out, Caroline.

1649
01:32:53,542 --> 01:32:54,509
Just take a breath.

1650
01:32:54,608 --> 01:32:55,609
-Just breathe with me.
-Stop.

1651
01:32:55,709 --> 01:32:56,710
Just start with a breath.

1652
01:33:07,755 --> 01:33:09,323
Caroline, wait!

1653
01:33:17,398 --> 01:33:19,467
Stop!

1654
01:33:34,381 --> 01:33:35,783
Caroline!

1655
01:33:38,119 --> 01:33:40,121
<i>If this is an emergency,</i>

1656
01:33:40,221 --> 01:33:42,256
<i>hang up and call 911.</i>

1657
01:33:42,356 --> 01:33:45,793
<i>Otherwise, call back</i>
<i>during normal business hours.</i>

1658
01:33:45,893 --> 01:33:46,827
Okay, call me back.

1659
01:33:46,927 --> 01:33:48,162
Call me back tonight, okay?

1660
01:33:48,262 --> 01:33:49,763
Please? Please, you said
that you could help me.

1661
01:33:49,864 --> 01:33:52,333
Please. Please, just
call me back, okay?

1662
01:33:52,433 --> 01:33:54,201
I need you. Bye.

1663
01:36:13,374 --> 01:36:15,075
Mommy?

1664
01:36:15,376 --> 01:36:19,346
Go back to sleep.
Everything's okay.

1665
01:36:20,314 --> 01:36:22,584
My tummy is wet.

1666
01:36:22,950 --> 01:36:26,954
Sh-sh-sh. It's okay.
I made it better, okay?

1667
01:36:27,622 --> 01:36:29,423
Go back to sleep.

1668
01:37:59,614 --> 01:38:01,583
Hello?

1669
01:38:01,683 --> 01:38:02,617
Hello?

1670
01:38:07,589 --> 01:38:09,223
Hello?

1671
01:38:15,697 --> 01:38:17,030
Oh!

1672
01:38:18,065 --> 01:38:19,233
Why are you here?

1673
01:38:20,635 --> 01:38:21,902
Are you okay?

1674
01:38:22,269 --> 01:38:23,237
Where...

1675
01:38:23,337 --> 01:38:25,540
When did you get here?
Why are you here?

1676
01:38:27,908 --> 01:38:28,976
Where is she?

1677
01:38:29,076 --> 01:38:31,979
She's asleep.

1678
01:38:32,246 --> 01:38:33,914
-With the babysitter?
-Yes.

1679
01:38:35,517 --> 01:38:36,851
Look, I just...

1680
01:38:36,950 --> 01:38:38,986
I couldn't think.
I couldn't function.

1681
01:38:39,086 --> 01:38:40,287
I couldn't do anything.

1682
01:38:40,387 --> 01:38:42,022
All I was doing was thinking
about you,

1683
01:38:42,122 --> 01:38:43,257
and her, and the apartment

1684
01:38:43,357 --> 01:38:45,426
so I had to come back.
I was scared.

1685
01:38:45,527 --> 01:38:48,061
-I wanted to help.
-Wait, wait, wait. Wait, I--

1686
01:38:51,866 --> 01:38:53,967
What? You just gotta
know how to talk to these guys.

1687
01:38:54,067 --> 01:38:55,369
That's all.

1688
01:38:55,469 --> 01:38:58,706
Did you look at it, the hole?
Did you see it?

1689
01:38:58,807 --> 01:39:00,073
Did you see anything?

1690
01:39:00,575 --> 01:39:04,111
Oh, yeah. No, it, uh...
It was not fixed.

1691
01:39:04,746 --> 01:39:06,146
Now it's fixed.

1692
01:39:06,581 --> 01:39:09,884
Okay. Okay, I think we should
just... Let's just go now.

1693
01:39:09,983 --> 01:39:11,753
I just don't see
how it got so bad.

1694
01:39:11,853 --> 01:39:13,287
How did it get so bad?

1695
01:39:13,387 --> 01:39:14,988
Are you trying to blame me?

1696
01:39:15,289 --> 01:39:17,625
No, I'm not blaming you.
I just...

1697
01:39:17,725 --> 01:39:18,992
I just want to get out of here.

1698
01:39:19,092 --> 01:39:20,494
-It was a huge hole.
-I want to get out of here.

1699
01:39:30,471 --> 01:39:31,706
Do you love me?

1700
01:39:33,575 --> 01:39:34,542
Yeah.

1701
01:39:44,451 --> 01:39:47,254
-Hey, hey. Wait, wait, wait.
-What?

1702
01:39:47,956 --> 01:39:49,389
What's the rush?

1703
01:39:49,490 --> 01:39:51,960
You were the one who was
in a rush to get back here.

1704
01:39:52,059 --> 01:39:53,962
I don't want
to be here anymore.

1705
01:39:54,361 --> 01:39:56,129
We are here, all right?

1706
01:39:56,230 --> 01:39:57,899
Let's relieve the babysitter.
I'm exhausted.

1707
01:39:57,998 --> 01:39:59,299
I want to get to sleep,

1708
01:39:59,399 --> 01:40:00,935
and I'm excited to see her
even if she's sleeping.

1709
01:40:01,034 --> 01:40:02,837
I know, but why don't
you go downstairs

1710
01:40:02,937 --> 01:40:04,137
and get us some wine
or something

1711
01:40:04,238 --> 01:40:05,507
and I can relieve the sitter

1712
01:40:05,607 --> 01:40:06,808
and then you can come
back up and then we can...

1713
01:40:06,908 --> 01:40:08,610
What's going on?
What's going on?

1714
01:40:08,710 --> 01:40:10,143
There's nothing going on.

1715
01:40:11,679 --> 01:40:13,615
Open the door.

1716
01:40:16,016 --> 01:40:18,620
-Me?
-I don't have a key.

1717
01:40:19,921 --> 01:40:22,356
Right, yeah. Okay.

1718
01:40:23,625 --> 01:40:25,192
Oh, God. Don't tell me
you left her here

1719
01:40:25,292 --> 01:40:28,428
-without having a key. Come on.
-No, no, no. No.

1720
01:40:28,530 --> 01:40:31,533
Of course, I have a key.
What do you think I am?

1721
01:40:37,504 --> 01:40:41,141
Hey. I'm her dad. I'm Charles.

1722
01:40:41,241 --> 01:40:43,243
Nice to meet you.
You must be the babysitter.

1723
01:40:43,343 --> 01:40:45,513
-Babysitter?
-Yeah, James, right?

1724
01:40:45,613 --> 01:40:48,783
-Jamie, right.
-Oh, thank you for...

1725
01:40:48,883 --> 01:40:50,518
Oh, hell no.

1726
01:40:50,618 --> 01:40:53,021
I'm not doing this
shit with you, yo.

1727
01:40:53,120 --> 01:40:54,221
Not doing what?
What are you talking about?

1728
01:40:54,321 --> 01:40:56,624
I'm not a fucking
babysitter, dude.

1729
01:40:57,926 --> 01:40:59,493
Excuse me?

1730
01:41:00,294 --> 01:41:03,263
Your daughter woke up
and was crying, scared shitless.

1731
01:41:03,363 --> 01:41:07,035
So I pounded on the fucking door
till she finally opened it.

1732
01:41:07,134 --> 01:41:08,736
I had to tell her
I was a friend of your wife.

1733
01:41:08,836 --> 01:41:11,706
Bro, it took me forever
to get her to go to sleep.

1734
01:41:11,806 --> 01:41:14,141
And by the way,
I had to give her a Band-Aid.

1735
01:41:14,241 --> 01:41:16,310
She has some shit oozing
from her stomach or something.

1736
01:41:16,410 --> 01:41:18,178
Hey. Okay, okay, hold on.
Hold on.

1737
01:41:18,278 --> 01:41:20,014
-Listen, who the fuck are you...
-Watch the leg, man.

1738
01:41:20,113 --> 01:41:21,348
...and what the hell
are you doing in my room?

1739
01:41:21,448 --> 01:41:23,685
-Your room?
-Yeah. This is my wife.

1740
01:41:23,785 --> 01:41:24,852
That's my child.

1741
01:41:24,953 --> 01:41:26,086
-Mommy?
-My room.

1742
01:41:26,186 --> 01:41:27,622
I just fucking told you
who I was,

1743
01:41:27,722 --> 01:41:30,058
and you need to ask your wife
why I got this cast on my leg.

1744
01:41:30,157 --> 01:41:32,359
It's-- I don't...
-Who is this guy?

1745
01:41:32,459 --> 01:41:34,896
-He's the babysitter.
-He's not the babysitter!

1746
01:41:34,996 --> 01:41:36,030
He just told me
he's not the babysitter.

1747
01:41:36,163 --> 01:41:37,097
I don't know
what he's talking about.

1748
01:41:37,197 --> 01:41:37,999
-Who the fuck is he?
-She's awake.

1749
01:41:38,098 --> 01:41:39,199
Can we just go inside?

1750
01:41:39,299 --> 01:41:40,500
She can hear everything
you're saying.

1751
01:41:40,602 --> 01:41:41,569
Can you even explain to me
why her machine is off

1752
01:41:41,669 --> 01:41:42,469
and the tube
is outside of her body?

1753
01:41:42,570 --> 01:41:43,805
Daddy! Are you out there?

1754
01:41:43,905 --> 01:41:45,205
-I ain't in this shit, man.
-Come see me!

1755
01:41:45,305 --> 01:41:46,841
-Let's go inside.
-Daddy! Daddy!

1756
01:41:46,941 --> 01:41:48,943
Hey. Hey. Lookit. Yes, hi.

1757
01:41:49,043 --> 01:41:50,243
Daddy's home!

1758
01:41:50,344 --> 01:41:51,579
Mom said we didn't need
the program anymore.

1759
01:41:51,679 --> 01:41:53,146
Oh, my gosh.
Look at you! You're beautiful.

1760
01:41:53,246 --> 01:41:54,515
But I didn't believe her
because Dr. Spring said I do.

1761
01:41:54,616 --> 01:41:57,719
-But look, she was right!
-What? What are you saying?

1762
01:41:57,819 --> 01:42:00,622
-Look! No tube!
-What?

1763
01:42:00,722 --> 01:42:01,756
The tube is garbage now.

1764
01:42:01,856 --> 01:42:03,625
I can go back to school!

1765
01:42:03,725 --> 01:42:05,292
Oh, my God.

1766
01:42:05,392 --> 01:42:07,294
-Oh, my God.
-But Daddy...

1767
01:42:07,394 --> 01:42:08,428
I still don't want to
eat food...

1768
01:42:08,529 --> 01:42:09,831
What...

1769
01:42:09,931 --> 01:42:10,765
-...because it's too squishy.
-What's going on?

1770
01:42:16,336 --> 01:42:18,138
Will you take me
to the playground tomorrow?

1771
01:42:18,238 --> 01:42:19,774
What did you do?

1772
01:42:20,041 --> 01:42:21,109
What did you do?!

1773
01:42:21,208 --> 01:42:22,342
