1
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:03,427
That dry wall again.

2
00:02:08,954 --> 00:02:11,740
Hi. I've got a surprise
for you.

3
00:02:13,655 --> 00:02:15,177
No.

4
00:02:15,178 --> 00:02:17,398
What if you've been hounding me
for like over a year?

5
00:02:21,053 --> 00:02:23,795
I'm serious.
An actual lipstick carousel?

6
00:02:25,232 --> 00:02:26,841
I found it on a state sale.

7
00:02:26,842 --> 00:02:30,061
I told you it was gonna be
a blessing to move up here.

8
00:02:30,062 --> 00:02:32,020
I still need to check
the state of the motor

9
00:02:32,021 --> 00:02:33,848
but it's in pretty good shape.

10
00:02:33,849 --> 00:02:35,545
I'll text you some pictures.

11
00:02:35,546 --> 00:02:38,331
Or, you know,
you could use it as an excuse

12
00:02:38,332 --> 00:02:39,767
to come up and see the house.

13
00:02:39,768 --> 00:02:42,900
Well, you got to come up
and visit sometime.

14
00:02:42,901 --> 00:02:44,859
I'm telling you, this house...

15
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:47,427
something about it
just drew me to it.

16
00:02:47,428 --> 00:02:50,604
Okay, yeah. I gotta go.
I'll text you pictures later.

17
00:02:50,605 --> 00:02:51,910
Bye.

18
00:02:56,219 --> 00:02:58,787
Oh... Hi.

19
00:02:59,918 --> 00:03:02,137
Do you like your new home?

20
00:03:02,138 --> 00:03:03,138
Yeah.

21
00:03:06,011 --> 00:03:07,448
Me too.

22
00:03:33,952 --> 00:03:36,737
Oh, Oh. Ma'am, ma'am!
You can't be in here.

23
00:03:36,738 --> 00:03:39,130
Uh, the floor's not safe.

24
00:03:39,131 --> 00:03:40,131
Oh.

25
00:03:44,093 --> 00:03:45,398
I'm just trying to establish

26
00:03:45,399 --> 00:03:47,269
what kind of time frame
we're talking about here

27
00:03:47,270 --> 00:03:48,488
since we have the baby on the...

28
00:03:48,489 --> 00:03:49,750
- Ah...
- Hey!

29
00:03:49,751 --> 00:03:51,186
- Hi!
- Did you just get in?

30
00:03:51,187 --> 00:03:52,840
Yeah. I tried calling you.

31
00:03:52,841 --> 00:03:54,537
Oh yeah. No, sorry, we just...

32
00:03:54,538 --> 00:03:58,454
Ah, it's just plumbing
Armageddon situation.

33
00:03:58,455 --> 00:04:00,543
- That sounds promising.
- Not really.

34
00:04:00,544 --> 00:04:01,892
How bad is it?

35
00:04:01,893 --> 00:04:03,329
It's not great.

36
00:04:03,330 --> 00:04:05,592
The amount of rock that
I can see in the sub floor...

37
00:04:05,593 --> 00:04:07,724
The drain's probably
been leaking for years.

38
00:04:07,725 --> 00:04:09,857
And they didn't find any of that
in the inspection?

39
00:04:09,858 --> 00:04:11,250
They probably missed it.

40
00:04:11,251 --> 00:04:13,208
But look we can handle
the re-pipe.

41
00:04:13,209 --> 00:04:14,731
But you're gonna need
a structural engineer

42
00:04:14,732 --> 00:04:15,993
to take a look at that floor.

43
00:04:15,994 --> 00:04:17,865
Anyone you recommend?

44
00:04:17,866 --> 00:04:19,693
Uh, I can make some calls.

45
00:04:19,694 --> 00:04:21,261
- Thanks.
- I'll get on that.

46
00:04:22,914 --> 00:04:24,915
Yeah, so that's my day.

47
00:04:24,916 --> 00:04:28,441
Miss, miss? Found this
lodged in the drain.

48
00:04:28,442 --> 00:04:29,659
Oh.

49
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:31,139
I know how you gals,

50
00:04:31,140 --> 00:04:32,881
you're all sentimental
about your jewelry.

51
00:04:35,449 --> 00:04:37,058
- It's not mine.
- Nice bloke, though.

52
00:04:37,059 --> 00:04:38,668
- Yeah.
- Yeah, come on.

53
00:04:38,669 --> 00:04:39,931
Let me get to that suit.

54
00:04:41,672 --> 00:04:44,108
Hi, Lou.

55
00:04:44,109 --> 00:04:47,764
- Ah, this is unbelievable.
- This is nonstop.

56
00:04:47,765 --> 00:04:50,506
As soon as we finish one thing,
something else explodes

57
00:04:50,507 --> 00:04:52,334
or rots or leaks.

58
00:04:52,335 --> 00:04:55,076
It's like we're living in a
in a never-ending game of the...

59
00:04:55,077 --> 00:04:56,860
You know what's the thing
where it pops up and you...

60
00:04:56,861 --> 00:04:57,905
- Whack-A-Mole?
- And you whack 'em.

61
00:04:57,906 --> 00:04:59,515
You sure it's a Whack-A-Mole?

62
00:04:59,516 --> 00:05:01,300
Ah!

63
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:02,824
Why can't anything be easy?

64
00:05:04,391 --> 00:05:07,785
Hey, I'm easy.

65
00:05:12,355 --> 00:05:14,487
House is disintegrating
around us

66
00:05:14,488 --> 00:05:17,359
and you are cracking jokes.

67
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:18,360
Hey.

68
00:05:19,754 --> 00:05:20,885
It's an old house.

69
00:05:22,147 --> 00:05:23,496
We knew what we were
getting into.

70
00:05:23,497 --> 00:05:24,497
Hmm.

71
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:27,065
It'll be great once it's done.

72
00:05:28,806 --> 00:05:29,806
You'll see.

73
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:32,200
We'll get through it.

74
00:05:33,289 --> 00:05:34,725
You're right. We always do.

75
00:05:39,251 --> 00:05:40,470
Hey yo, watch out!

76
00:05:42,864 --> 00:05:45,867
No. No, no, no, no, no, no.

77
00:07:20,788 --> 00:07:21,788
Lou?

78
00:08:01,132 --> 00:08:02,830
Ssh.

79
00:08:04,571 --> 00:08:05,876
She's looking for you.

80
00:08:07,399 --> 00:08:09,096
Oh, my God.

81
00:08:09,097 --> 00:08:11,402
- You scared the shit out of me.
- You scared the shit out of me.

82
00:08:11,403 --> 00:08:12,795
You wanna put me
in premature labor?

83
00:08:12,796 --> 00:08:14,276
Come here.
I wanna show you something.

84
00:08:17,801 --> 00:08:19,020
Huh?

85
00:08:20,587 --> 00:08:22,283
What do you think?

86
00:08:22,284 --> 00:08:24,546
Yeah, nice work, Professor.

87
00:08:24,547 --> 00:08:26,854
Ahan. Who says intellectuals
can't be all manly?

88
00:08:28,377 --> 00:08:30,770
Ooh. And all that.
Check this out.

89
00:08:30,771 --> 00:08:35,644
Baby TV, over here is up
and running.

90
00:08:35,645 --> 00:08:36,819
We are live.

91
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:38,212
As you can see a motion detector

92
00:08:38,213 --> 00:08:39,605
and oh, a microphone.

93
00:08:39,606 --> 00:08:40,997
Hey, baby.

94
00:08:40,998 --> 00:08:42,433
<i>Hey, baby.</i>

95
00:08:42,434 --> 00:08:44,349
And it's all operated
wirelessly.

96
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:47,351
- Pretty cool.
- Pretty impressive, right?

97
00:08:47,352 --> 00:08:49,050
Here. What?

98
00:08:50,355 --> 00:08:51,475
You're forgetting something.

99
00:08:52,575 --> 00:08:54,663
Oh shit. Is that the...

100
00:08:54,664 --> 00:08:56,709
I need to shower
or we're gonna be late.

101
00:08:56,710 --> 00:08:58,537
You're going...
You gonna wear that?

102
00:08:58,538 --> 00:09:00,190
- Yeah, you don't like it?
- No, I love it. Beautiful.

103
00:09:00,191 --> 00:09:02,150
- Just to impress, right?
- Fetching.

104
00:09:20,603 --> 00:09:21,995
Looking gorgeous.

105
00:09:21,996 --> 00:09:23,431
Remind me again
who we're supposed

106
00:09:23,432 --> 00:09:25,520
- to be impressing tonight?
- Uh, Dean Whittier.

107
00:09:25,521 --> 00:09:27,043
Is that the guy
with the moustache?

108
00:09:27,044 --> 00:09:29,655
No, no, that's Barkley.
That's uh... that's the chair.

109
00:09:29,656 --> 00:09:32,135
Oh, God. Everyone in Academia
looks the same.

110
00:09:32,136 --> 00:09:33,615
It's all smoking jackets
and facial hair.

111
00:09:33,616 --> 00:09:35,749
Just look for the guy with a mo.

112
00:09:37,054 --> 00:09:39,578
So, tell me
how did you two meet?

113
00:09:39,579 --> 00:09:41,580
We met the old-fashioned way.

114
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:42,581
- Yeah...
- We met at a bar.

115
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:43,886
Right.

116
00:09:43,887 --> 00:09:46,367
I was out one night
having drinks with friends

117
00:09:46,368 --> 00:09:49,413
and I spot this guy alone,
sitting at the bar.

118
00:09:49,414 --> 00:09:51,198
I just got in the country
and so I was...

119
00:09:51,199 --> 00:09:54,157
So, he finally works up
the nerve to come over

120
00:09:54,158 --> 00:09:55,550
and he offers to buy me a drink.

121
00:09:55,551 --> 00:09:57,204
Well, I actually bought
a round of drinks for her

122
00:09:57,205 --> 00:09:58,553
and her maids.

123
00:09:58,554 --> 00:09:59,859
It was all a trap...

124
00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:02,557
Which was a rather
steep investment on my part

125
00:10:02,558 --> 00:10:03,645
- during that time.
- Oh, okay.

126
00:10:03,646 --> 00:10:05,038
Apparently,
I was worth the splurge.

127
00:10:05,039 --> 00:10:06,692
- Well, apparently.
- I was a little tipsy.

128
00:10:06,693 --> 00:10:08,258
- And we get to talking.
- That's right,

129
00:10:08,259 --> 00:10:10,609
and she tells me about
her antiques business, right?

130
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:11,740
Hm-mm.

131
00:10:11,741 --> 00:10:13,742
And, he mentions this old watch
he has

132
00:10:13,743 --> 00:10:15,831
and he's been meaning
to get it restored.

133
00:10:15,832 --> 00:10:17,485
So, I said
I'd take a look at it.

134
00:10:17,486 --> 00:10:19,356
Which was a lie, of course.

135
00:10:19,357 --> 00:10:20,706
- There was no watch.
- No watch.

136
00:10:20,707 --> 00:10:22,533
And I just wanted
to see her again.

137
00:10:22,534 --> 00:10:26,146
So, I spend the next 24 hours
scouring all of lower Manhattan

138
00:10:26,147 --> 00:10:28,670
trying to find a watch.
I find one, I bring it to her.

139
00:10:28,671 --> 00:10:30,106
- Total fake.
- Total fake.

140
00:10:30,107 --> 00:10:31,021
Hm-mm.

141
00:10:31,022 --> 00:10:32,674
It wasn't my proudest moment,

142
00:10:32,675 --> 00:10:34,023
but still works.

143
00:10:34,024 --> 00:10:35,983
And I got a date out of it,
didn't I?

144
00:10:38,768 --> 00:10:39,813
Thank you.

145
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:07,796
Tuna tartar?

146
00:11:07,797 --> 00:11:10,017
I wish. Thanks.

147
00:11:12,019 --> 00:11:13,584
Don't worry.

148
00:11:13,585 --> 00:11:15,413
You'll be eating it all again
soon enough.

149
00:11:16,545 --> 00:11:18,590
My downfall was always
the cheese.

150
00:11:19,853 --> 00:11:21,636
So, where'd you end up settling?

151
00:11:21,637 --> 00:11:23,682
We bought a house by the lake.

152
00:11:23,683 --> 00:11:25,422
Oh, it's stunning up there.

153
00:11:25,423 --> 00:11:26,859
John and I have toyed
with the idea

154
00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:28,295
of moving up there for years.

155
00:11:28,296 --> 00:11:31,341
- Which property?
- 8317 Lake view.

156
00:11:31,342 --> 00:11:32,865
Oh yes.

157
00:11:32,866 --> 00:11:35,476
I knew a man who lived up there
many years ago.

158
00:11:35,477 --> 00:11:38,219
Unfortunately,
his wife became quite ill.

159
00:11:39,699 --> 00:11:41,264
Anyway, you must be
over the moon.

160
00:11:41,265 --> 00:11:44,485
- It's your first?
- Ah.

161
00:11:44,486 --> 00:11:47,880
- Yes. Yes, it is.
- Brilliant.

162
00:11:47,881 --> 00:11:50,447
A new job and a baby on the way.

163
00:11:50,448 --> 00:11:52,188
So much to celebrate.

164
00:11:52,189 --> 00:11:53,234
Cheers.

165
00:11:59,893 --> 00:12:01,894
You heard Bartlett
raving about my work

166
00:12:01,895 --> 00:12:03,547
on the advisory committee?

167
00:12:03,548 --> 00:12:07,464
I mean, I'm telling you Jules,
there's a real opportunity here.

168
00:12:07,465 --> 00:12:08,596
I'm gonna play my cards right

169
00:12:08,597 --> 00:12:10,511
and I could be running
the department

170
00:12:10,512 --> 00:12:12,601
in, I don't know, five years.

171
00:12:14,081 --> 00:12:16,779
Huh? Everything okay?

172
00:12:17,649 --> 00:12:19,695
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

173
00:12:20,957 --> 00:12:22,698
You barely said a word
the whole drive home.

174
00:12:26,354 --> 00:12:27,874
You told that woman
this was our first.

175
00:12:29,531 --> 00:12:31,620
What would you have me say?

176
00:12:32,882 --> 00:12:36,015
I passed it as an exactly
cocktail conversation, Jules.

177
00:12:36,016 --> 00:12:37,494
You don't have to lie about it.

178
00:12:37,495 --> 00:12:38,974
Well, she asked
a simple question.

179
00:12:38,975 --> 00:12:41,063
I... I gave a simple answer.

180
00:12:41,064 --> 00:12:42,587
Right.

181
00:12:43,893 --> 00:12:47,026
God forbid,
you upset our fancy new friends.

182
00:12:47,027 --> 00:12:48,723
Hang on, Jules. Jules, Jules.

183
00:12:48,724 --> 00:12:50,682
It's not like that.
You know it's not like that.

184
00:12:51,683 --> 00:12:53,293
There's people
in the department,

185
00:12:53,294 --> 00:12:54,555
people that were way before,

186
00:12:54,556 --> 00:12:56,818
that know what we went through.

187
00:12:56,819 --> 00:13:00,256
I mean, isn't this meant to be
a fresh start for us?

188
00:13:00,257 --> 00:13:01,518
You know,
giving this a fresh go.

189
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:02,693
How are we gonna do that,

190
00:13:02,694 --> 00:13:04,174
if we're just clinging
on to the past?

191
00:13:05,175 --> 00:13:06,568
Daniel, he was your son.

192
00:13:07,830 --> 00:13:09,439
It's like sometimes you forget
he even existed!

193
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:11,355
And you forgot he ever died.

194
00:13:13,314 --> 00:13:15,925
No. Jules, please stop.
Please, just talk to me. Wait.

195
00:13:19,755 --> 00:13:22,627
Jules! Jules.

196
00:13:25,195 --> 00:13:27,807
- Vitals?
- BP of 149 over 90.

197
00:13:28,851 --> 00:13:30,852
I need a Doppler and an IV.

198
00:13:30,853 --> 00:13:32,462
How far long is she?

199
00:13:32,463 --> 00:13:34,203
Thirty-two weeks.

200
00:13:34,204 --> 00:13:35,771
Ma'am, can you hear me?

201
00:13:36,946 --> 00:13:38,706
<i>- Good Julie, one more.
- One more, one more.</i>

202
00:13:40,515 --> 00:13:41,777
<i>Go, go, go.</i>

203
00:13:43,735 --> 00:13:45,127
One more. I know you're tired.

204
00:13:45,128 --> 00:13:46,488
<i>- Go, go, go.
- One more, one more.</i>

205
00:13:50,568 --> 00:13:51,918
Got ya. That's it, that's it.

206
00:13:54,485 --> 00:13:55,747
Start compressions.

207
00:13:56,531 --> 00:13:58,611
- Why isn't he crying?
- It's fine. Jules, it's fine.

208
00:14:00,361 --> 00:14:01,883
Is he okay? What is happening?

209
00:14:01,884 --> 00:14:03,145
- What's happening?
- It's alright.

210
00:14:03,146 --> 00:14:04,712
- Can I see him?
- Just try to relax.

211
00:14:04,713 --> 00:14:06,322
Why isn't he crying?
I can't hear him.

212
00:14:06,323 --> 00:14:07,715
Let's go again. Right now.

213
00:14:07,716 --> 00:14:09,716
- What's going on with my baby?
- He's fine, right?

214
00:14:10,675 --> 00:14:13,200
Julie, I'm so sorry.

215
00:14:38,486 --> 00:14:40,182
Hey.

216
00:14:40,183 --> 00:14:41,184
Hey.

217
00:14:43,273 --> 00:14:44,274
You're in the hospital.

218
00:14:45,928 --> 00:14:46,928
You had a bad fall.

219
00:14:47,974 --> 00:14:49,540
- Is she...
- She's okay.

220
00:14:51,194 --> 00:14:52,194
Baby's okay.

221
00:14:56,547 --> 00:14:59,810
You suffered what we call
a partial placenta abruption.

222
00:14:59,811 --> 00:15:02,291
Abruption? What's that?

223
00:15:02,292 --> 00:15:04,380
It's when the placenta
becomes partially detached

224
00:15:04,381 --> 00:15:05,512
from the uterine wall.

225
00:15:05,513 --> 00:15:07,427
Is it dangerous?

226
00:15:07,428 --> 00:15:10,952
Well, it can be life-threatening
if the placenta fully separates

227
00:15:10,953 --> 00:15:14,652
but as you can see,
the tear appears fairly minimal.

228
00:15:15,697 --> 00:15:18,046
And so far the situation
seems to be stabilized.

229
00:15:18,047 --> 00:15:19,395
Bleeding stopped

230
00:15:19,396 --> 00:15:21,268
and your baby's
got a good strong heartbeat.

231
00:15:23,618 --> 00:15:26,926
However, it is standard practice
to exercise caution.

232
00:15:28,275 --> 00:15:29,319
What does that mean?

233
00:15:31,887 --> 00:15:34,541
It means I want you on bed rest.

234
00:15:34,542 --> 00:15:37,674
Strict bed rest for the duration
of your pregnancy.

235
00:15:37,675 --> 00:15:41,113
No driving, no lifting,
no cooking.

236
00:15:41,114 --> 00:15:43,593
Other than the occasional trip
to the bathroom,

237
00:15:43,594 --> 00:15:45,248
you need to be in bed idle.

238
00:15:47,337 --> 00:15:49,817
You're saying you want me in bed

239
00:15:49,818 --> 00:15:50,950
for the next eight weeks?

240
00:15:52,299 --> 00:15:54,169
I know it's not ideal.

241
00:15:54,170 --> 00:15:56,432
But we don't want you going
into early labor.

242
00:15:56,433 --> 00:15:59,087
Anything before 37 weeks
is considered preterm

243
00:15:59,088 --> 00:16:01,307
and can put the baby at risk
of low birth weight

244
00:16:01,308 --> 00:16:03,352
or respiratory distress.

245
00:16:03,353 --> 00:16:04,701
We're in the middle
of a renovation

246
00:16:04,702 --> 00:16:06,877
and we're overseeing everything.

247
00:16:06,878 --> 00:16:08,096
I would strongly recommend

248
00:16:08,097 --> 00:16:10,403
putting any major projects
on hold,

249
00:16:10,404 --> 00:16:11,579
until after the baby comes.

250
00:16:13,755 --> 00:16:15,495
Do you have any family
or friends in the area?

251
00:16:15,496 --> 00:16:17,149
Anyone who can help you out?

252
00:16:17,150 --> 00:16:19,064
Not since we moved, no.

253
00:16:19,065 --> 00:16:20,282
Well, if you need support,

254
00:16:20,283 --> 00:16:21,676
we'd be happy
to offer a referral.

255
00:16:24,896 --> 00:16:25,896
Any other questions?

256
00:16:29,858 --> 00:16:30,902
When can I go home?

257
00:16:39,433 --> 00:16:40,737
<i>To avoid preterm labor,</i>

258
00:16:40,738 --> 00:16:42,523
<i>you need to follow
a few simple rules.</i>

259
00:16:43,698 --> 00:16:46,092
One, you need to remain
in bed 24 hours a day.

260
00:16:47,441 --> 00:16:49,485
Two, you're allowed brief trips
to the bathroom

261
00:16:49,486 --> 00:16:52,140
and one ten-minute bath
every three days,

262
00:16:52,141 --> 00:16:53,141
no more.

263
00:16:54,535 --> 00:16:56,754
And finally,
the most important rule.

264
00:16:57,625 --> 00:16:59,279
It's crucial
that you avoid stress.

265
00:17:00,628 --> 00:17:02,455
Anything that raises
your blood pressure

266
00:17:02,456 --> 00:17:04,761
not only endangers the health
of your child,

267
00:17:04,762 --> 00:17:07,068
but could re trigger
the mental dissociation

268
00:17:07,069 --> 00:17:08,766
you experienced
after your last pregnancy.

269
00:17:10,638 --> 00:17:13,162
My advice, try to enjoy the R&R.

270
00:17:18,428 --> 00:17:20,648
Alright. Here we go.

271
00:17:25,914 --> 00:17:27,610
The brakes.

272
00:17:27,611 --> 00:17:30,091
And easy. Easy does it.

273
00:17:30,092 --> 00:17:32,267
Let me take this.

274
00:17:32,268 --> 00:17:34,227
Alright, there we are.

275
00:17:35,054 --> 00:17:36,620
I'll get the shoes.

276
00:17:37,578 --> 00:17:40,101
Yeah, gonna get rid of these.

277
00:17:40,102 --> 00:17:41,538
Right. Let's get you on the bed.

278
00:17:42,931 --> 00:17:44,366
- Alright, you good?
- Yeah.

279
00:17:44,367 --> 00:17:45,367
Alright.

280
00:17:46,413 --> 00:17:49,328
Right. Now, you ready for this?

281
00:17:49,329 --> 00:17:53,507
Because I have you
all hooked up.

282
00:17:54,725 --> 00:17:56,900
- I'll supply it.
- Got you some lotion,

283
00:17:56,901 --> 00:17:58,685
- got your some prenatals.
- Oh.

284
00:17:58,686 --> 00:18:00,643
- I know what you're thinking.
- How you're gonna reach them.

285
00:18:00,644 --> 00:18:02,819
Well, I got you
this cool grab stick.

286
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:04,560
You can just,
you know, try it out.

287
00:18:04,561 --> 00:18:05,996
Nice.

288
00:18:05,997 --> 00:18:09,696
Here some trashy magazines,
I know you love those.

289
00:18:09,697 --> 00:18:13,439
Read it to your heart's content.
An iPad, your laptop and uh...

290
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:15,528
oh, vintage
entertainment system.

291
00:18:15,529 --> 00:18:18,531
Very vintage but courtesy
of the English's department's

292
00:18:18,532 --> 00:18:21,577
- uh... supply closet.
- Wow.

293
00:18:21,578 --> 00:18:24,406
It's old but antique, maybe,
you know?

294
00:18:24,407 --> 00:18:25,495
Maybe it's worth a fortune.

295
00:18:26,540 --> 00:18:27,975
No?

296
00:18:27,976 --> 00:18:31,674
Mini fridge, stacked full
of amazing awesome shit.

297
00:18:31,675 --> 00:18:33,459
Because that's kind
of a husband I am.

298
00:18:33,460 --> 00:18:34,765
Oh, and the best part.

299
00:18:38,639 --> 00:18:40,422
- Walkie talkies.
- Walkie talkies.

300
00:18:40,423 --> 00:18:41,771
One for you.

301
00:18:41,772 --> 00:18:43,991
Eighteen channels,
23-mile radius.

302
00:18:43,992 --> 00:18:46,689
So, we can communicate
anywhere in the house.

303
00:18:46,690 --> 00:18:48,300
Anywhere.

304
00:18:48,301 --> 00:18:50,954
Or we could you know, text.

305
00:18:50,955 --> 00:18:53,087
Yeah, but what's the fun
in that?

306
00:18:53,088 --> 00:18:54,568
Try it out.
Go on, turn it on.

307
00:18:57,527 --> 00:18:58,614
<i>Attention all units...</i>

308
00:18:58,615 --> 00:19:01,095
Ssshhhh. No, no, just um...

309
00:19:01,096 --> 00:19:03,271
Get to change the channel.
We can ignore that.

310
00:19:03,272 --> 00:19:05,448
Just uh, uh...
next, next channel. Shit.

311
00:19:07,189 --> 00:19:09,016
Got it?
Break a break.

312
00:19:09,017 --> 00:19:11,671
It's big daddy,
come in hot mama.

313
00:19:11,672 --> 00:19:13,542
Got any request?

314
00:19:13,543 --> 00:19:16,110
Ah, sure could use a cup of tea,
big daddy.

315
00:19:16,111 --> 00:19:17,720
Ten-four. Hot mama.

316
00:19:17,721 --> 00:19:19,679
Shot of hot liquid lightning
comin' up.

317
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:21,376
Over and out.

318
00:19:21,377 --> 00:19:23,335
- Go say over.
- Over and out.

319
00:19:23,336 --> 00:19:24,988
Nice. Alright.

320
00:19:24,989 --> 00:19:27,078
Oh, and uh...
don't you go anywhere.

321
00:20:32,927 --> 00:20:34,797
<i>Three times faster
than our leading competitor,</i>

322
00:20:34,798 --> 00:20:36,322
<i>Our little one...</i>

323
00:22:55,548 --> 00:22:56,984
Mommy must be hearing things.

324
00:23:04,078 --> 00:23:05,295
<i>The breeze.</i>

325
00:23:05,296 --> 00:23:07,297
<i>The winds now fasting up to 39.</i>

326
00:23:07,298 --> 00:23:08,995
<i>So, this just gives you the idea</i>

327
00:23:08,996 --> 00:23:10,431
<i>that the winds are going to...</i>

328
00:23:10,432 --> 00:23:12,112
Looks like we have some
weather rolling in.

329
00:23:13,696 --> 00:23:14,783
Maybe they'll cancel
your classes

330
00:23:14,784 --> 00:23:16,064
and we can bed rest it together.

331
00:23:17,483 --> 00:23:20,746
What do you think?
Binge-watch <i>Grey's Anatomy</i>?

332
00:23:20,747 --> 00:23:22,618
Eat our weight in popcorn.

333
00:23:23,924 --> 00:23:25,751
- Are you listening to me?
- Yeah no.

334
00:23:25,752 --> 00:23:30,059
Um, this funny thing happened
in our faculty.

335
00:23:30,060 --> 00:23:32,540
Meeting today,
and I'm just texting...

336
00:23:32,541 --> 00:23:35,064
Hahaha. LOL.

337
00:23:35,065 --> 00:23:36,326
What happened?

338
00:23:36,327 --> 00:23:38,459
- With what?
- In your meeting?

339
00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:40,853
Oh. Well, you had to be there.

340
00:23:40,854 --> 00:23:42,899
Otherwise, it's just...
stupid.

341
00:23:46,468 --> 00:23:48,208
- What's that?
- What's what?

342
00:23:48,209 --> 00:23:49,428
That, the package right there.

343
00:23:50,994 --> 00:23:53,194
Oh, that's just some stuff
that I ordered for the house.

344
00:23:55,912 --> 00:23:57,478
Did you...
did you go downstairs

345
00:23:57,479 --> 00:23:58,611
and get it?

346
00:24:01,178 --> 00:24:03,049
Jules, you know
what the doctor said.

347
00:24:03,050 --> 00:24:04,529
- You can't
- I was careful.

348
00:24:04,530 --> 00:24:05,617
Doesn't matter!

349
00:24:05,618 --> 00:24:07,053
There are rules.
You can't get up.

350
00:24:07,054 --> 00:24:08,794
You can't just...
just move around.

351
00:24:08,795 --> 00:24:10,273
- He made it very clear...
- Jesus! What are you?

352
00:24:10,274 --> 00:24:12,014
My frickin' jailer.

353
00:24:12,015 --> 00:24:13,407
"I can't get up.
I can't walk around."

354
00:24:13,408 --> 00:24:14,887
I can't go outside.

355
00:24:14,888 --> 00:24:16,454
I can't continue
with this renovation

356
00:24:16,455 --> 00:24:18,107
cause God forbid the fumes
and the noise,

357
00:24:18,108 --> 00:24:20,849
might cause me undue stress.

358
00:24:20,850 --> 00:24:23,374
Getting that stupid box
was the highlight of my day.

359
00:24:26,203 --> 00:24:27,203
I just...

360
00:24:28,684 --> 00:24:30,120
It sucks.

361
00:24:34,647 --> 00:24:36,344
I get it. I do. I...

362
00:24:38,955 --> 00:24:41,044
I am sorry. Alright.

363
00:24:42,002 --> 00:24:44,787
Hey. I am sorry.

364
00:24:46,136 --> 00:24:49,705
I just don't know I...
I worry, you know?

365
00:24:52,795 --> 00:24:53,795
Thank you.

366
00:24:56,190 --> 00:24:57,470
Thank you for doing this for us.

367
00:24:59,846 --> 00:25:05,503
And thank you for being
on your best behavior.

368
00:25:05,504 --> 00:25:07,636
Your mommy and I
really appreciate it.

369
00:25:14,121 --> 00:25:15,121
I love you.

370
00:25:24,131 --> 00:25:25,132
Goodnight.

371
00:25:26,612 --> 00:25:28,178
Night.

372
00:26:47,475 --> 00:26:49,084
- Hm?
- Wake up, wake up. Wake up.

373
00:26:49,085 --> 00:26:50,564
- What?
- There's someone in the closet.

374
00:26:50,565 --> 00:26:51,652
- What?
- There's someone in the closet.

375
00:26:51,653 --> 00:26:52,653
What?!

376
00:26:54,787 --> 00:26:56,702
Fucking shit!

377
00:26:58,486 --> 00:26:59,486
Daniel.

378
00:27:13,196 --> 00:27:15,242
Oh. You scared this shit
out of me.

379
00:27:20,595 --> 00:27:22,858
- You sure you're feeling okay?
- I...

380
00:27:28,690 --> 00:27:29,690
Jesus.

381
00:27:31,388 --> 00:27:33,607
It's probably
just your sleep mind, alright?

382
00:27:33,608 --> 00:27:35,261
Let's get some rest, love.

383
00:27:35,262 --> 00:27:36,350
Come.

384
00:27:57,501 --> 00:27:59,301
You were supposed
to pick them up from school!

385
00:28:00,243 --> 00:28:01,809
Where were they, Todd?

386
00:28:01,810 --> 00:28:05,118
Girl, you need that kick
that man to the curb.

387
00:28:34,495 --> 00:28:35,495
Hey there!

388
00:28:38,064 --> 00:28:39,717
What you doing?

389
00:28:39,718 --> 00:28:41,153
Ssh.

390
00:28:41,154 --> 00:28:45,027
Haw. Hide and seek?

391
00:28:47,116 --> 00:28:48,291
Where's your mama?

392
00:29:46,436 --> 00:29:47,436
Goddammit, Lou.

393
00:29:48,961 --> 00:29:52,616
Lou! Get off! Off! Yes, off!

394
00:30:20,166 --> 00:30:21,949
<i>9-1-1, what's your emergency?</i>

395
00:30:21,950 --> 00:30:24,778
Please help.
There's someone in my house.

396
00:30:24,779 --> 00:30:26,258
<i>What's your address, ma'am?</i>

397
00:30:26,259 --> 00:30:29,783
8317 Lake view. Hurry please.

398
00:30:29,784 --> 00:30:32,612
<i>- We have a unit on the way.
- Are you in a safe place?</i>

399
00:30:32,613 --> 00:30:34,614
I'm in my bedroom.

400
00:30:34,615 --> 00:30:36,268
<i>And where is the intruder?</i>

401
00:30:36,269 --> 00:30:38,357
Down the hall.

402
00:30:38,358 --> 00:30:39,881
<i>Is your bedroom door locked?</i>

403
00:30:43,232 --> 00:30:44,232
No.

404
00:30:45,495 --> 00:30:46,975
<i>Ma'am, can you get to the door?</i>

405
00:30:49,804 --> 00:30:51,109
<i>Ma'am?</i>

406
00:30:51,110 --> 00:30:52,110
Yes.

407
00:31:04,601 --> 00:31:05,601
<i>Ma'am?</i>

408
00:31:58,351 --> 00:31:59,351
Jules?

409
00:31:59,961 --> 00:32:02,789
Hey. You alright?

410
00:32:02,790 --> 00:32:04,226
You okay? Yeah?

411
00:32:06,707 --> 00:32:07,837
Daniel Rivers.

412
00:32:07,838 --> 00:32:08,969
Deputy Gates.
We spoke on the phone.

413
00:32:08,970 --> 00:32:10,971
Alright, yes. Any more news?

414
00:32:10,972 --> 00:32:13,713
No. Still unable
to locate a suspect.

415
00:32:13,714 --> 00:32:15,194
Did you get a look at the guy?

416
00:32:16,586 --> 00:32:18,023
Didn't turn up a child, either.

417
00:32:18,980 --> 00:32:20,807
A child?

418
00:32:20,808 --> 00:32:22,853
Your wife thought she heard
a child in the house.

419
00:32:28,555 --> 00:32:31,165
Well, looks like we've got
everything we need.

420
00:32:31,166 --> 00:32:33,472
If there's anything else
we can do,

421
00:32:33,473 --> 00:32:34,734
just give us a call.

422
00:32:34,735 --> 00:32:37,345
Right, yes.
Of course, thank you Officer.

423
00:32:37,346 --> 00:32:38,521
Here, I'll walk you out.

424
00:32:48,183 --> 00:32:49,968
Sorry for wasting your time.

425
00:33:23,653 --> 00:33:26,917
Go ahead and say it.
I know you're thinking it.

426
00:33:29,703 --> 00:33:31,399
Should I be worried?

427
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:33,098
There's just a misunderstanding.

428
00:33:35,535 --> 00:33:37,189
You don't believe me?

429
00:33:39,365 --> 00:33:40,801
What am I supposed to think,
Jules?

430
00:33:42,803 --> 00:33:46,414
Mental dissociation
or a fixation on a child?

431
00:33:46,415 --> 00:33:48,461
- I saw something.
- That wasn't there.

432
00:33:51,464 --> 00:33:53,944
I feel like we're on a verge
of something here. We...

433
00:33:58,775 --> 00:34:01,039
I need to know
that the past is behind us.

434
00:34:05,043 --> 00:34:06,643
I need to know
that you're not relapsing.

435
00:34:08,263 --> 00:34:09,308
It's not like last time.

436
00:34:12,572 --> 00:34:14,616
I'm calling Doctor Meadows.

437
00:34:14,617 --> 00:34:16,575
I'm going to bring you
someone in.

438
00:34:16,576 --> 00:34:18,456
- I don't need a babysitter.
- It's not for you.

439
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:20,841
It's for her.

440
00:35:10,891 --> 00:35:12,239
<i>Okay?</i>

441
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:13,328
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

442
00:38:24,214 --> 00:38:26,913
Can baby sister
come out to play?

443
00:38:39,142 --> 00:38:40,142
Andrew?

444
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:53,200
Andrew? Is that you sweetie?

445
00:38:57,987 --> 00:38:59,032
It's mommy.

446
00:39:00,860 --> 00:39:02,209
Can you come back please?

447
00:39:03,950 --> 00:39:05,995
Please? Can you hear me?

448
00:39:07,606 --> 00:39:08,998
Jules?

449
00:39:10,260 --> 00:39:12,262
Hey. I heard the door slam.

450
00:39:13,176 --> 00:39:15,613
- You alright?
- Yeah.

451
00:39:15,614 --> 00:39:18,050
I was just trying
to Facetime with a friend.

452
00:39:18,051 --> 00:39:19,051
It's not working.

453
00:39:20,749 --> 00:39:21,749
Right.

454
00:40:05,011 --> 00:40:07,230
Hey. Hi, I'm Daniel.

455
00:40:30,819 --> 00:40:32,908
One-nineteen over 80. Very good.

456
00:40:39,393 --> 00:40:40,828
Delmy.

457
00:40:40,829 --> 00:40:42,069
I never heard that name before.

458
00:40:43,484 --> 00:40:44,789
It's pretty.

459
00:40:44,790 --> 00:40:46,399
It was my grandmother's.

460
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:48,620
A fine German name,
as my father would say.

461
00:40:51,361 --> 00:40:52,362
May I?

462
00:41:25,657 --> 00:41:27,572
One-forty. It's perfect.

463
00:41:32,490 --> 00:41:33,570
How have you been sleeping?

464
00:41:36,276 --> 00:41:38,365
Hm, not great.

465
00:41:39,801 --> 00:41:41,063
That's the irony of bed rest.

466
00:41:42,761 --> 00:41:44,065
All the time
in the world to sleep

467
00:41:44,066 --> 00:41:45,503
and unable to do it.

468
00:41:46,547 --> 00:41:47,547
Do you have kids?

469
00:41:48,593 --> 00:41:51,116
Um, my husband and I tried

470
00:41:51,117 --> 00:41:52,945
but my body just wasn't
equipped for it.

471
00:41:54,033 --> 00:41:55,468
I'm sorry,
I shouldn't have asked.

472
00:41:55,469 --> 00:41:56,687
No, please.

473
00:41:56,688 --> 00:41:58,211
Sharing my journey is important.

474
00:42:01,170 --> 00:42:03,215
In my experience
there's more than one path

475
00:42:03,216 --> 00:42:05,478
into motherhood.

476
00:42:05,479 --> 00:42:08,263
I consider myself a proud mother
of the countless babies

477
00:42:08,264 --> 00:42:09,584
I've helped bring
into this world.

478
00:42:14,575 --> 00:42:15,837
Daniel told me about your son.

479
00:42:19,624 --> 00:42:21,147
He also told me about Oakview.

480
00:42:24,411 --> 00:42:25,411
How long were you there?

481
00:42:28,241 --> 00:42:30,242
Six weeks.

482
00:42:30,243 --> 00:42:31,505
Post partum depression?

483
00:42:34,073 --> 00:42:35,335
It was part of the psychosis.

484
00:42:36,902 --> 00:42:37,946
I kept seeing my son.

485
00:42:39,731 --> 00:42:41,036
My mind wasn't ready to let go.

486
00:42:45,693 --> 00:42:49,088
I know it's difficult bringing
a stranger into your home.

487
00:42:50,785 --> 00:42:52,570
But I want you to know
I'm here for you.

488
00:42:53,396 --> 00:42:54,483
Whatever it is you're feeling,

489
00:42:54,484 --> 00:42:55,924
whatever it is
you're experiencing...

490
00:42:57,487 --> 00:42:58,487
you can trust me.

491
00:43:01,753 --> 00:43:02,753
I appreciate that.

492
00:43:04,494 --> 00:43:05,494
You should get some rest.

493
00:43:54,240 --> 00:43:55,240
<i>Easy.</i>

494
00:43:59,158 --> 00:44:00,158
There you go.

495
00:44:18,307 --> 00:44:19,569
I can manage from here.

496
00:44:21,528 --> 00:44:22,528
Thank you.

497
00:44:24,705 --> 00:44:25,966
Okay.

498
00:44:25,967 --> 00:44:27,708
I'll be in the other room
if you need me.

499
00:44:43,681 --> 00:44:46,596
Oh God, no.
I thought she'd never leave.

500
00:44:57,956 --> 00:44:59,348
<i>Baby sister coming.</i>

501
00:45:07,443 --> 00:45:08,444
Delmy!

502
00:45:16,235 --> 00:45:18,628
Well, probably just
a Braxton-Hicks contraction.

503
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:20,761
Is it uncommon?

504
00:45:22,023 --> 00:45:23,703
Just the body's way
of preparing for birth.

505
00:45:25,244 --> 00:45:27,114
She's alright?

506
00:45:27,115 --> 00:45:28,115
The baby's fine.

507
00:45:29,988 --> 00:45:33,034
To be honest, it's you
who I'm concerned with.

508
00:45:34,253 --> 00:45:36,429
I understand
you've been having some uh...

509
00:45:37,952 --> 00:45:39,171
some experiences.

510
00:45:46,744 --> 00:45:48,222
The insomnia
has just been messing

511
00:45:48,223 --> 00:45:49,572
with my head a little.

512
00:45:50,922 --> 00:45:52,053
Tell me about the boy.

513
00:45:56,971 --> 00:45:57,971
How old was he?

514
00:46:00,975 --> 00:46:02,063
Four, maybe five.

515
00:46:03,325 --> 00:46:04,805
The age your son would be now?

516
00:46:07,547 --> 00:46:10,376
Perhaps your mind remains
unwilling to let go,

517
00:46:11,769 --> 00:46:13,161
even after all these years.

518
00:46:15,729 --> 00:46:16,773
Would you uh...

519
00:46:16,774 --> 00:46:18,123
would you mind giving us
a moment?

520
00:46:18,514 --> 00:46:20,429
Uh, yeah.

521
00:46:28,133 --> 00:46:30,173
Julie, no one ever said
that bed rest would be easy.

522
00:46:31,658 --> 00:46:34,225
And more often, than not
the psychological challenges

523
00:46:34,226 --> 00:46:35,575
outweigh the physical ones.

524
00:46:37,011 --> 00:46:38,534
Especially for someone like me.

525
00:46:43,670 --> 00:46:45,237
As I see it,
we have two options.

526
00:46:46,673 --> 00:46:48,369
We can move you to the hospital.

527
00:46:48,370 --> 00:46:50,458
That would allow to finish
your pregnancy

528
00:46:50,459 --> 00:46:51,720
under the supervision

529
00:46:51,721 --> 00:46:52,939
of a highly qualified
medical staff. Two...

530
00:46:52,940 --> 00:46:53,940
No.

531
00:46:57,423 --> 00:46:59,293
No more hospitals.

532
00:46:59,294 --> 00:47:01,469
The other option is you remain
here at home.

533
00:47:01,470 --> 00:47:04,821
My caveat being you have
to restart your medication.

534
00:47:04,822 --> 00:47:06,605
What about the baby?

535
00:47:06,606 --> 00:47:08,955
You are 35 weeks along.

536
00:47:08,956 --> 00:47:11,044
The meds would have little
to no impact

537
00:47:11,045 --> 00:47:12,872
on your baby's development.

538
00:47:12,873 --> 00:47:15,483
Right now,
the most important thing

539
00:47:15,484 --> 00:47:18,052
you can do for her,
is to take care of you.

540
00:47:21,751 --> 00:47:22,883
Try to get some rest.

541
00:47:47,038 --> 00:47:48,387
<i>It could be
an isolated incident.</i>

542
00:47:51,303 --> 00:47:52,651
<i>Or, it might be a precursor</i>

543
00:47:52,652 --> 00:47:54,958
<i>to a more significant
psychological break.</i>

544
00:47:54,959 --> 00:47:56,307
<i>And she clearly thinks</i>

545
00:47:56,308 --> 00:47:58,657
<i>she's seeing
your previous child.</i>

546
00:47:58,658 --> 00:48:00,006
<i>The medication should alleviate
her symptoms,</i>

547
00:48:00,007 --> 00:48:02,966
<i>but if they do persist,</i>

548
00:48:02,967 --> 00:48:04,315
<i>you may want to consider
admitting her</i>

549
00:48:04,316 --> 00:48:05,491
<i>to a mental health facility.</i>

550
00:48:19,984 --> 00:48:20,985
It's for the best.

551
00:48:28,862 --> 00:48:30,342
Good girl.

552
00:50:05,654 --> 00:50:06,742
Lou.

553
00:50:08,527 --> 00:50:10,007
You wanna play, buddy?

554
00:50:12,052 --> 00:50:13,184
Alright.

555
00:50:21,844 --> 00:50:24,150
Alright, you ready?

556
00:50:24,151 --> 00:50:26,371
You ready? Here you go.

557
00:51:16,334 --> 00:51:17,465
You see him, too?

558
00:51:44,927 --> 00:51:45,972
Andrew?

559
00:52:21,050 --> 00:52:22,182
Andrew?

560
00:52:25,272 --> 00:52:26,708
Sweetie, are you there?

561
00:52:28,493 --> 00:52:30,495
Baby sister wants to see you.

562
00:52:34,977 --> 00:52:36,588
Don't you want to come out
and play?

563
00:53:12,711 --> 00:53:14,886
Are you here to see baby sister?

564
00:53:14,887 --> 00:53:17,542
You should leave.

565
00:53:19,370 --> 00:53:21,154
What do you mean? Why?

566
00:53:22,068 --> 00:53:23,939
She wants baby sister.

567
00:53:25,985 --> 00:53:29,118
Who? Who wants baby sister?

568
00:53:30,729 --> 00:53:31,904
You almost done in there?

569
00:53:34,559 --> 00:53:36,430
Just a few more minutes.

570
00:53:38,737 --> 00:53:41,783
No. No, wait.
Please don't leave.

571
00:53:43,437 --> 00:53:45,309
I want to know
who wants baby sister.

572
00:53:47,267 --> 00:53:49,269
Don't want you pruning
on my watch.

573
00:54:01,977 --> 00:54:05,546
Here we are.
Nice and warm.

574
00:54:08,680 --> 00:54:10,116
We gotta take care of our baby.

575
00:54:11,813 --> 00:54:15,469
Did you feel that?
She kicked for me.

576
00:54:18,080 --> 00:54:20,257
Oh, I almost forgot.

577
00:54:21,736 --> 00:54:23,347
Must not forget your pill.

578
00:54:36,229 --> 00:54:38,317
I'm just asking you
where you found her?

579
00:54:38,318 --> 00:54:39,318
Well, I got her number,

580
00:54:39,319 --> 00:54:40,406
I told you from the hospital.

581
00:54:40,407 --> 00:54:41,625
I told you that.

582
00:54:41,626 --> 00:54:44,367
Right. But did you call
her references?

583
00:54:44,368 --> 00:54:45,977
Did you do a background check?
Anything?

584
00:54:45,978 --> 00:54:47,326
Meadows recommended her,

585
00:54:47,327 --> 00:54:48,719
so, I didn't think
it was necessary.

586
00:54:48,720 --> 00:54:50,635
I mean, she is...
lucky she was even available.

587
00:54:54,203 --> 00:54:55,813
I want her out of the house.

588
00:54:55,814 --> 00:54:57,858
- Are you serious?
- Yes!

589
00:54:57,859 --> 00:54:59,817
Delmy is a godsend.

590
00:54:59,818 --> 00:55:02,298
- I don't trust her.
- Why?

591
00:55:02,299 --> 00:55:03,690
I just don't.

592
00:55:03,691 --> 00:55:06,432
That woman, she's the reason
I'm able to go to work

593
00:55:06,433 --> 00:55:08,521
and not endlessly worry
about you all day

594
00:55:08,522 --> 00:55:10,175
being here by yourself.

595
00:55:10,176 --> 00:55:13,352
So, if I'm gonna let her go
or even consider that,

596
00:55:13,353 --> 00:55:15,963
then I... I think I deserve
some kind of explanation

597
00:55:15,964 --> 00:55:17,356
or reason why something.

598
00:55:17,357 --> 00:55:18,967
Fine.

599
00:55:20,186 --> 00:55:21,187
Go on.

600
00:55:25,844 --> 00:55:29,934
The boy I've been seeing,
he's not in my head, Daniel.

601
00:55:29,935 --> 00:55:31,370
What are you talking about?

602
00:55:31,371 --> 00:55:34,199
I've been hearing him
in the nursery

603
00:55:34,200 --> 00:55:35,288
through the baby cam.

604
00:55:36,463 --> 00:55:39,160
Daniel...

605
00:55:39,161 --> 00:55:40,727
- it's our son.
- Stop it, Julie.

606
00:55:40,728 --> 00:55:42,381
- It's Andrew.
- Stop it, Julie.

607
00:55:42,382 --> 00:55:44,252
And I know it sounds crazy,
but he's reaching out.

608
00:55:44,253 --> 00:55:45,558
- Jules, Jules, please.
- Please don't do this.

609
00:55:45,559 --> 00:55:47,560
- He's trying to warn us.
- Please...

610
00:55:47,561 --> 00:55:48,996
He's trying to warn us
about Delmy.

611
00:55:48,997 --> 00:55:52,086
- What are you talking about?
- She wants our baby.

612
00:55:52,087 --> 00:55:53,392
And that's why
he's reaching out.

613
00:55:53,393 --> 00:55:54,915
- He's trying to protect us.
- Stop it. Stop it.

614
00:55:54,916 --> 00:55:57,004
Stop it! Stop!

615
00:55:57,005 --> 00:55:59,093
Our son is dead. He's dead.

616
00:55:59,094 --> 00:56:00,618
You think I don't know that?

617
00:56:01,619 --> 00:56:04,360
You think I don't know that?!

618
00:56:04,361 --> 00:56:06,057
You think that fact
doesn't burn a hole

619
00:56:06,058 --> 00:56:08,539
in my heart every goddamn day!

620
00:56:10,454 --> 00:56:12,194
I was the one that held him!

621
00:56:13,500 --> 00:56:15,372
Praying for him to breathe.

622
00:56:18,026 --> 00:56:20,507
So, you don't have to tell me
that he's dead, Daniel.

623
00:56:22,422 --> 00:56:23,684
I was there.

624
00:56:25,338 --> 00:56:27,078
Everything okay?

625
00:56:27,079 --> 00:56:28,515
- We're fine!
- Yeah.

626
00:56:34,608 --> 00:56:35,740
- Daniel...
- Just...

627
00:56:50,015 --> 00:56:51,145
You two are getting friendly.

628
00:56:51,146 --> 00:56:52,586
Have you been taking
your medication?

629
00:56:53,888 --> 00:56:55,933
- Have you?
- Don't you dare blame this

630
00:56:55,934 --> 00:56:57,717
on some fucking
chemical imbalance?

631
00:56:57,718 --> 00:56:59,415
You're seeing our dead son,
Julie.

632
00:56:59,416 --> 00:57:01,330
So, just for a second here.

633
00:57:02,506 --> 00:57:04,681
Imagine though what its like
from my perspective.

634
00:57:04,682 --> 00:57:06,161
I know what that's like!

635
00:57:07,554 --> 00:57:10,382
I am well aware
of what you think of me.

636
00:57:10,383 --> 00:57:14,430
I hear the whispers,
I see the look on your face.

637
00:57:14,431 --> 00:57:17,520
That awful mix of pity and fear.

638
00:57:17,521 --> 00:57:19,609
I know you think I'm cracking.

639
00:57:19,610 --> 00:57:24,135
That I'm on some hormonally
fucked downward spiral

640
00:57:24,136 --> 00:57:25,528
but I'm not.

641
00:57:25,529 --> 00:57:27,094
And if I were you, I...

642
00:57:27,095 --> 00:57:29,707
I'd probably be on the verge
of hospitalizing me too.

643
00:57:31,796 --> 00:57:33,450
But it's not in my head.

644
00:57:35,060 --> 00:57:36,060
It's not.

645
00:57:37,497 --> 00:57:40,718
Daniel... our son.

646
00:57:42,371 --> 00:57:44,808
Our son, he's reaching out.

647
00:57:44,809 --> 00:57:47,506
He's trying to communicate
with me.

648
00:57:47,507 --> 00:57:49,508
And instead of your judgment,

649
00:57:49,509 --> 00:57:51,685
I could really use your support
right now.

650
00:57:54,427 --> 00:57:55,559
I'm sorry, Jules.

651
00:57:58,387 --> 00:57:59,954
I think you need more
than my support.

652
00:59:32,656 --> 00:59:34,092
Okay, call me then.

653
00:59:58,638 --> 00:59:59,638
Nice and strong.

654
01:00:02,250 --> 01:00:04,426
- You should eat something.
- I'm not hungry.

655
01:00:05,906 --> 01:00:07,786
You know we all want
what's best for you, right?

656
01:00:16,264 --> 01:00:17,875
I lost my first child
at 18 weeks.

657
01:00:19,659 --> 01:00:21,355
Pregnancy was going alone fine

658
01:00:21,356 --> 01:00:23,532
and out of the blue,
my water broke.

659
01:00:25,230 --> 01:00:28,015
An incompetent cervix.
That's what they told me.

660
01:00:30,191 --> 01:00:31,801
I managed to conceive
three more times

661
01:00:31,802 --> 01:00:33,673
but never carried any to term.

662
01:00:34,979 --> 01:00:37,415
I felt so hollow, so alone,

663
01:00:37,416 --> 01:00:41,812
kept... asking myself
what I'd done to deserve it.

664
01:00:44,075 --> 01:00:46,642
And I remembered a story
I'd heard as a child.

665
01:00:46,643 --> 01:00:48,688
About a family who lived up
around this lake.

666
01:00:50,429 --> 01:00:51,429
Three small kids,

667
01:00:52,561 --> 01:00:53,841
mother pregnant with the fourth.

668
01:00:55,347 --> 01:00:58,654
She and her husband
were on the way to the hospital

669
01:00:58,655 --> 01:01:01,526
in early labor when their car
skidded on some ice.

670
01:01:01,527 --> 01:01:02,659
Crashed into a tree.

671
01:01:04,835 --> 01:01:07,228
The impact taking the life
of their unborn daughter.

672
01:01:09,013 --> 01:01:10,970
The woman was inconsolable.

673
01:01:10,971 --> 01:01:13,233
Every night,
her cries could be heard

674
01:01:13,234 --> 01:01:14,931
around the lake
lamenting the loss

675
01:01:14,932 --> 01:01:17,237
of her baby girl.

676
01:01:17,238 --> 01:01:20,240
She didn't eat,
barely left the house.

677
01:01:20,241 --> 01:01:22,286
The faces
of her three living children

678
01:01:22,287 --> 01:01:27,421
just reminded her
how she'd failed as a mother.

679
01:01:27,422 --> 01:01:29,816
How she could never truly
protect them.

680
01:01:32,079 --> 01:01:34,865
And eventually,
it just became too much.

681
01:01:35,735 --> 01:01:36,997
She took her own life?

682
01:01:44,483 --> 01:01:48,705
That story reminded me
that I wasn't alone.

683
01:01:50,663 --> 01:01:52,490
That mothers have been
bearing the burden of loss

684
01:01:52,491 --> 01:01:53,840
since the beginning of time.

685
01:01:55,929 --> 01:01:57,843
But it's what you do
with that pain,

686
01:01:57,844 --> 01:01:59,106
that defines you.

687
01:02:02,240 --> 01:02:04,808
A mother's grief
is a powerful thing.

688
01:02:07,636 --> 01:02:09,463
You either learn
to make peace with it

689
01:02:09,464 --> 01:02:10,596
or it eats you alive.

690
01:02:25,437 --> 01:02:26,437
What was her name?

691
01:02:28,745 --> 01:02:29,745
The mother?

692
01:02:31,530 --> 01:02:37,101
Oh um, Kinsey, I think.
Melandra Kinsey.

693
01:02:40,234 --> 01:02:41,627
You should try
and get some rest.

694
01:03:15,313 --> 01:03:16,401
M. K.

695
01:03:37,074 --> 01:03:38,465
<i>Courier Archives.</i>

696
01:03:38,466 --> 01:03:42,556
Hi. Uh, I was wondering
if you could help me.

697
01:03:42,557 --> 01:03:44,515
I'm trying to track down
an old news story

698
01:03:44,516 --> 01:03:47,170
that your paper
may have covered.

699
01:03:47,171 --> 01:03:48,693
<i>How far back you're talking?</i>

700
01:03:48,694 --> 01:03:52,871
Um, late 60s, early 70s.

701
01:03:52,872 --> 01:03:54,351
<i>Uh, doubt it.</i>

702
01:03:54,352 --> 01:03:57,571
<i>Our digital archives only cover
the last few decades.</i>

703
01:03:57,572 --> 01:03:59,747
<i>Unless it was a major
news story.</i>

704
01:03:59,748 --> 01:04:01,401
<i>What are you looking for
exactly?</i>

705
01:04:01,402 --> 01:04:02,750
Uh, it was a suicide.

706
01:04:02,751 --> 01:04:04,666
A local woman
named Melandra Kinsey.

707
01:04:06,886 --> 01:04:09,497
<i>- Let me get your email.
- I'll see what I can find.</i>

708
01:05:48,422 --> 01:05:50,684
Andrew, sweetheart.

709
01:05:50,685 --> 01:05:52,600
I need to ask you
something important.

710
01:05:57,954 --> 01:05:59,998
Hi, sweetie.

711
01:05:59,999 --> 01:06:02,740
The person
who wants baby sister,

712
01:06:02,741 --> 01:06:04,917
is it someone named
Melandra Kinsey?

713
01:06:07,789 --> 01:06:08,921
Andrew?

714
01:06:12,620 --> 01:06:13,620
Where'd you go?

715
01:07:19,426 --> 01:07:21,950
Delmy! Delmy, need help.

716
01:07:27,217 --> 01:07:28,609
What is it? A contraction?

717
01:07:30,089 --> 01:07:31,612
How many have you had?

718
01:07:36,008 --> 01:07:37,008
Julie?

719
01:07:38,271 --> 01:07:40,055
There was someone.

720
01:07:40,056 --> 01:07:41,534
How long?

721
01:07:41,535 --> 01:07:43,841
Twenty, 30 seconds.

722
01:07:43,842 --> 01:07:45,234
It could be early labor.

723
01:07:45,235 --> 01:07:47,105
Let's start monitoring
and see if it progresses.

724
01:07:47,106 --> 01:07:48,585
Wait!

725
01:07:48,586 --> 01:07:50,848
I'm just gonna get my kit
and throw on some clothes.

726
01:07:50,849 --> 01:07:52,111
No, no. Please don't leave.

727
01:07:53,808 --> 01:07:55,983
There's nothing to fear.

728
01:07:55,984 --> 01:07:57,504
You're bringing a baby
into this world.

729
01:07:58,944 --> 01:07:59,945
I'll be right back.

730
01:08:44,207 --> 01:08:45,207
Oh, my God.

731
01:08:50,865 --> 01:08:54,041
Ah. You're having contractions?

732
01:08:54,042 --> 01:08:55,434
It's early stages

733
01:08:55,435 --> 01:08:57,567
but if she progresses
we'll head to the hospital.

734
01:08:57,568 --> 01:08:59,657
It's happening, Jules.
We're havin' a baby.

735
01:09:03,530 --> 01:09:04,792
Baby sister coming.

736
01:09:05,576 --> 01:09:06,576
You okay?

737
01:09:08,622 --> 01:09:10,145
We have to go.

738
01:09:10,146 --> 01:09:11,842
- Nooo. No, no, no.
- Hey, hey, hey Jules. Relax.

739
01:09:11,843 --> 01:09:13,452
- No need to rush.
- It's an early labor.

740
01:09:13,453 --> 01:09:15,193
No, it's not safe.
We need to leave.

741
01:09:15,194 --> 01:09:16,194
- No, no Jules. Jules relax.
- Wait.

742
01:09:16,195 --> 01:09:17,587
Let me go.

743
01:09:17,588 --> 01:09:19,328
Julie, you need to listen to me.
It's very important.

744
01:09:19,329 --> 01:09:21,112
- Relax.
- No, there's no time.

745
01:09:21,113 --> 01:09:22,331
There's no time.
She's already here.

746
01:09:22,332 --> 01:09:24,943
- Who? Who's here?
- Melandra Kinsey.

747
01:09:26,031 --> 01:09:27,684
Julie, Melandra Kinsey's
just a story.

748
01:09:27,685 --> 01:09:29,207
No, she's not! No, no, no.

749
01:09:29,208 --> 01:09:30,687
I found her name
in the change of title.

750
01:09:30,688 --> 01:09:31,818
She lived here.

751
01:09:31,819 --> 01:09:33,298
Look. This was her bracelet,
Daniel.

752
01:09:33,299 --> 01:09:34,560
Jules, Jules.

753
01:09:34,561 --> 01:09:36,127
- She killed herself.
- Please sit down, Jules.

754
01:09:36,128 --> 01:09:37,781
- And not just that. She killed her three kids.
- Love...

755
01:09:37,782 --> 01:09:38,912
She couldn't cope with the grief

756
01:09:38,913 --> 01:09:40,087
- of losing her baby girl.
- Can you...

757
01:09:40,088 --> 01:09:41,785
And... and she took them
with her.

758
01:09:41,786 --> 01:09:43,613
- Just sit down please.
- She drowned them all in the bathtub.

759
01:09:43,614 --> 01:09:44,963
It was a long time ago.

760
01:09:48,053 --> 01:09:49,053
You knew?

761
01:09:51,665 --> 01:09:53,014
You loved the house.

762
01:09:53,667 --> 01:09:54,885
I just wanted you to be happy

763
01:09:54,886 --> 01:09:57,235
so, I was protecting you
as well.

764
01:09:57,236 --> 01:09:58,324
For what? Lying?

765
01:09:59,195 --> 01:10:01,196
By deliberately withholding
the truth from me.

766
01:10:01,197 --> 01:10:02,415
Cause I was scared!

767
01:10:05,897 --> 01:10:07,463
Do you know
what it was like for me?

768
01:10:07,464 --> 01:10:10,031
Coming home and finding you
in a pool of blood.

769
01:10:12,686 --> 01:10:14,513
Watching you struggle
day in and day out

770
01:10:14,514 --> 01:10:17,213
after Andrew dies, and...
and I just... I can't...

771
01:10:19,084 --> 01:10:20,390
And I can't help you.

772
01:10:22,522 --> 01:10:24,263
This house made you smile
again, Jules.

773
01:10:26,265 --> 01:10:27,918
Made you happy.

774
01:10:27,919 --> 01:10:29,007
But you didn't believe me.

775
01:10:29,964 --> 01:10:31,530
I told you
that there was something

776
01:10:31,531 --> 01:10:33,271
going on in this house
and you wouldn't listen.

777
01:10:33,272 --> 01:10:34,577
Neither of you.
You both made me think

778
01:10:34,578 --> 01:10:35,926
- that it was all in my head.
- Just...

779
01:10:35,927 --> 01:10:37,580
Because it is all in your head.
Hey love. Just...

780
01:10:37,581 --> 01:10:39,495
No, it's not Daniel.
It's not all in my head.

781
01:10:39,496 --> 01:10:40,844
It's not.
Melandra Kinsey is here.

782
01:10:40,845 --> 01:10:42,672
- Please. Julie.
- She's in this house.

783
01:10:42,673 --> 01:10:44,674
Julie.
And she wants our baby!

784
01:10:44,675 --> 01:10:46,416
Julie.

785
01:11:15,749 --> 01:11:16,749
Jules.

786
01:11:45,997 --> 01:11:47,215
What the hell.

787
01:12:07,323 --> 01:12:09,281
Better hide. Mommy's coming.

788
01:12:17,071 --> 01:12:19,271
Get the chair. Get the chair.
We're getting out of here.

789
01:12:22,642 --> 01:12:23,817
Come with me. You alright.

790
01:12:29,040 --> 01:12:30,824
Leave her alone!

791
01:12:40,573 --> 01:12:41,573
Daniel.

792
01:12:46,013 --> 01:12:47,013
Let's go!

793
01:12:48,276 --> 01:12:49,276
Come on.

794
01:12:56,459 --> 01:12:57,460
Come on.

795
01:13:15,695 --> 01:13:18,088
Daniel. Oh, Daniel.

796
01:13:18,089 --> 01:13:19,872
Honey. Daniel?

797
01:13:19,873 --> 01:13:21,135
Hey, Daniel.

798
01:13:46,204 --> 01:13:47,858
Fuck you!

799
01:14:29,552 --> 01:14:30,596
Hello.

800
01:14:32,468 --> 01:14:34,208
Can anybody hear me? Hello?

801
01:14:38,517 --> 01:14:42,433
My name is Julie Rivers.
I live in 8317 Lakeview Drive.

802
01:14:42,434 --> 01:14:43,957
I need help. I'm in labor.

803
01:15:11,419 --> 01:15:12,855
<i>Great, Julie.</i>

804
01:15:12,856 --> 01:15:14,247
<i>We're doing this right now,
sweetheart.</i>

805
01:15:14,248 --> 01:15:15,408
<i>Okay, don't think. Just push.</i>

806
01:15:27,174 --> 01:15:29,699
<i>Push. Give me everything
you got, Julie.</i>

807
01:15:36,401 --> 01:15:38,081
<i>Keep going, keep going.
You're right there.</i>

808
01:15:40,971 --> 01:15:42,371
<i>- That's it, that's it.
- That's it.</i>

809
01:16:25,145 --> 01:16:26,320
Hi.

810
01:16:40,770 --> 01:16:42,380
It's okay, its's over.

811
01:17:30,558 --> 01:17:32,604
You don't get this one, bitch!

812
01:17:58,108 --> 01:17:59,586
Jules!

813
01:17:59,587 --> 01:18:01,023
Jules!

814
01:18:01,024 --> 01:18:02,764
Jules! Jules!

815
01:18:02,765 --> 01:18:03,765
Jules!

816
01:18:08,858 --> 01:18:09,858
Okay.

817
01:18:15,603 --> 01:18:19,172
Come on. Oh, come on, please!

818
01:18:20,696 --> 01:18:21,697
Don't. Stop.

819
01:18:23,655 --> 01:18:25,395
- Take her.
- No. No.

820
01:18:25,396 --> 01:18:26,396
Just get her out.

821
01:18:28,181 --> 01:18:29,269
Go.

822
01:18:30,749 --> 01:18:32,185
I'll come right back.

823
01:19:22,540 --> 01:19:23,628
Get away from her.

824
01:19:44,823 --> 01:19:47,521
This is my child!

825
01:19:59,011 --> 01:20:00,012
Get out!

826
01:20:14,374 --> 01:20:19,597
Daniel, you okay? Daniel?

827
01:20:26,560 --> 01:20:29,041
Help! Help! Please, my wife.

828
01:20:32,175 --> 01:20:33,698
Jules. Jules.

829
01:20:35,961 --> 01:20:39,747
Hey, hey. Jules.

830
01:20:41,010 --> 01:20:44,490
Hey! In here!

831
01:20:44,491 --> 01:20:45,970
Come on. Let's go. Let's go.

832
01:20:45,971 --> 01:20:47,537
Let's go right.

833
01:20:47,538 --> 01:20:49,408
Sir, I need you
to clear the scene.

834
01:20:49,409 --> 01:20:51,671
- Sir, what's her name?
- Julie, Julie.

835
01:20:51,672 --> 01:20:54,023
Julie? Julie?

836
01:20:54,893 --> 01:20:56,154
How long has been down?

837
01:20:56,155 --> 01:20:57,795
A few like...
A few minutes, five minutes.

838
01:20:59,158 --> 01:21:00,678
Don't have a pulse.
Start compressions.

839
01:21:02,074 --> 01:21:03,074
Julie?

840
01:21:36,195 --> 01:21:37,501
He's calling for you.

841
01:22:13,972 --> 01:22:15,191
Andrew.

842
01:22:34,601 --> 01:22:35,863
Hi, love.

843
01:22:44,872 --> 01:22:46,352
Alright. Mommy's got you.

844
01:23:17,035 --> 01:23:18,689
Let's go again. Clear.

845
01:23:22,171 --> 01:23:24,411
Picking up a faint heartbeat.
Let's do some compressions.

846
01:23:25,174 --> 01:23:26,653
Julie, can you hear me? Julie?

847
01:23:28,612 --> 01:23:30,482
You stay with us.
Come on, Julie.

848
01:23:30,483 --> 01:23:31,963
Please. Jules, Jules.

849
01:23:33,530 --> 01:23:34,530
Please come back to me.

850
01:23:35,836 --> 01:23:39,057
I love you.
I love you so much.

851
01:23:43,975 --> 01:23:45,585
- Come on.
- Julie.

852
01:24:06,693 --> 01:24:07,781
Will you take care of him?

853
01:24:09,696 --> 01:24:10,828
Of course.

854
01:24:28,324 --> 01:24:29,325
Goodbye, my love.

855
01:24:33,590 --> 01:24:34,590
We'll be waiting for you.

856
01:24:43,904 --> 01:24:45,863
- Come on. Stay with us.
- Come on, Julie.

857
01:24:48,648 --> 01:24:49,867
Picking up a faint heartbeat.

858
01:24:51,129 --> 01:24:52,129
Going one more time.

859
01:24:53,392 --> 01:24:54,915
Clear.

860
01:25:18,113 --> 01:25:19,114
Yeah.

861
01:25:20,985 --> 01:25:22,465
Again. Ready?

862
01:25:29,950 --> 01:25:32,083
Mommy.

863
01:25:36,740 --> 01:25:39,481
- Daddy, can I get one?
- Hm-mm.

864
01:25:39,482 --> 01:25:40,743
Mommy get one.

865
01:25:40,744 --> 01:25:41,961
- Yeah.
- Ah.

866
01:25:41,962 --> 01:25:43,267
Um.

867
01:25:43,268 --> 01:25:44,268
You want it?

868
01:25:45,662 --> 01:25:46,793
- Yeah!
- Yeah.
