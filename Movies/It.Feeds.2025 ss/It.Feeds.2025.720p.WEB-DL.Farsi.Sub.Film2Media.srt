1
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:00,494
<i>Relax.</i>

2
00:01:01,529 --> 00:01:03,096
<i>We're going to begin.</i>

3
00:01:43,705 --> 00:01:47,575
<i>Help me!</i>
<i>He won't let me go!</i>

4
00:01:53,213 --> 00:01:55,382
<i>Can't you</i>
<i>please help me?</i>

5
00:02:19,206 --> 00:02:21,241
<i>He won't let me go!</i>

6
00:02:59,747 --> 00:03:00,715
Cynthia?

7
00:03:04,217 --> 00:03:06,054
Look at this one.

8
00:03:11,224 --> 00:03:12,426
Larry.

9
00:03:13,161 --> 00:03:14,595
You can leave.

10
00:03:15,029 --> 00:03:16,329
The door is open.

11
00:03:17,899 --> 00:03:19,634
I can't let you out.

12
00:03:20,267 --> 00:03:21,769
Only you can.

13
00:03:22,402 --> 00:03:23,370
When you're ready.

14
00:03:23,504 --> 00:03:25,940
Don't talk to him!

15
00:03:29,510 --> 00:03:32,412
Larry, you are in control here.

16
00:03:32,547 --> 00:03:34,682
He has no power over you.

17
00:03:35,248 --> 00:03:36,551
You just have to see.

18
00:03:59,207 --> 00:04:00,641
Oh!

19
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:11,919
Larry, it's okay.

20
00:04:13,688 --> 00:04:15,388
We'll try again next time, okay?

21
00:04:34,374 --> 00:04:37,044
Larry, we're back.

22
00:04:38,079 --> 00:04:39,213
Breathe.

23
00:04:42,415 --> 00:04:45,520
Okay, it's okay.
You're safe.

24
00:04:55,530 --> 00:04:56,864
I'm sorry.

25
00:04:56,998 --> 00:04:58,365
It's all right.

26
00:05:00,433 --> 00:05:02,003
He was...

27
00:05:04,304 --> 00:05:06,741
He was my...

28
00:05:09,476 --> 00:05:10,845
I know.

29
00:05:11,946 --> 00:05:14,048
That's all the time
we have for today.

30
00:05:14,182 --> 00:05:17,151
But you are welcome to stay
as long as you like.

31
00:05:17,417 --> 00:05:19,153
Someone digging around
in your mind

32
00:05:19,287 --> 00:05:22,322
can be very disorienting.

33
00:05:23,124 --> 00:05:24,926
Takes a lot out of you.

34
00:05:29,096 --> 00:05:30,698
Just right there.

35
00:05:30,932 --> 00:05:34,467
Um, I'll be right back.
Chamomile, right?

36
00:05:34,602 --> 00:05:35,870
-Okay.
-Okay.

37
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:42,076
Hey, are you okay?

38
00:05:42,475 --> 00:05:44,477
-Yeah.
-So what happened? He was, like,

39
00:05:44,612 --> 00:05:46,581
blocking a memory
or something, right?

40
00:05:47,048 --> 00:05:49,784
Can you find out what
phys ed teachers

41
00:05:49,917 --> 00:05:53,187
Larry had between grades
four and twelve?

42
00:05:53,321 --> 00:05:55,756
-Yeah.
-A coach maybe,

43
00:05:55,890 --> 00:05:56,958
balding,

44
00:05:57,792 --> 00:06:00,161
yellow and blue should be
the school colors.

45
00:06:06,067 --> 00:06:10,638
How, how does that
happen in real life?

46
00:06:11,038 --> 00:06:14,675
You've heard the saying
mind over body, right?

47
00:06:14,809 --> 00:06:18,846
So what my mother just did
in there not only felt real,

48
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:20,815
but to her mind, it was real.

49
00:06:21,148 --> 00:06:23,017
That's why we have
to be careful.

50
00:06:25,485 --> 00:06:28,656
She, has she ever
done that to you?

51
00:06:29,156 --> 00:06:31,092
No, no. Um...

52
00:06:31,626 --> 00:06:34,095
I think she's afraid of
what she might see.

53
00:06:34,228 --> 00:06:35,630
She should promote it.

54
00:06:36,130 --> 00:06:37,832
Maybe at the hospital.
I work there.

55
00:06:37,965 --> 00:06:39,533
She could help a lot of people.

56
00:06:39,667 --> 00:06:42,703
Larry, the rules are there
to protect her.

57
00:06:42,837 --> 00:06:45,139
To the outside world,
she's just a therapist.

58
00:06:45,273 --> 00:06:48,142
That's it. Nothing out of the
ordinary. Standard practice.

59
00:06:48,276 --> 00:06:50,410
-I know.
-Okay?

60
00:06:53,347 --> 00:06:55,883
Have you ever tried it?

61
00:06:56,284 --> 00:06:59,320
Like, is it passed down?

62
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:03,190
Well, I've been training,
but nothing yet.

63
00:07:03,324 --> 00:07:05,626
Both my parents did have
the ability, though.

64
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:08,062
They learned to master
it together.

65
00:07:08,195 --> 00:07:11,198
It's kind of how they found
each other, actually. Yeah.

66
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:13,367
Your dad did it too?

67
00:07:17,838 --> 00:07:20,207
I'll be right back, okay? Take
as much time as you need.

68
00:07:30,418 --> 00:07:31,319
- Hi.
- Hi.

69
00:07:31,484 --> 00:07:32,720
Can I help you?

70
00:07:32,853 --> 00:07:35,556
Hey. I need to speak
to Cynthia Winstone.

71
00:07:35,690 --> 00:07:37,291
I don't think she's
expecting anyone.

72
00:07:37,425 --> 00:07:40,127
I don't have much time. I need
to speak with her now, please.

73
00:07:40,261 --> 00:07:41,494
I need help.

74
00:07:41,629 --> 00:07:43,496
Okay, okay. Come in
from the rain.

75
00:07:45,299 --> 00:07:47,501
Are you with someone?
Like a parent, or...

76
00:07:47,635 --> 00:07:51,572
My dad's coming, but I need
to talk to Cynthia.
I, I heard she can help me.

77
00:07:51,706 --> 00:07:53,174
I left my dad at the
grocery store.

78
00:07:53,307 --> 00:07:55,009
I stole this from him so he's
going to know where I am.

79
00:07:55,142 --> 00:07:57,345
I need to see her before
he gets here.

80
00:07:57,477 --> 00:07:59,280
Okay, okay, come on.

81
00:07:59,413 --> 00:08:00,348
Just around here.

82
00:08:08,823 --> 00:08:10,424
Listen, you can tell me
if you're in danger.

83
00:08:10,558 --> 00:08:11,559
I am.

84
00:08:11,959 --> 00:08:13,194
Do you need me to
call the police?

85
00:08:13,327 --> 00:08:16,496
No, no police. I just need
to speak to her.

86
00:08:18,199 --> 00:08:22,003
Those look painful. Can I ask
what happened?

87
00:08:25,172 --> 00:08:27,475
We have a procedure.
I can't let you speak to her

88
00:08:27,608 --> 00:08:29,643
without at least doing
an assessment.

89
00:08:32,246 --> 00:08:33,948
-Yep.
-Okay.

90
00:08:38,586 --> 00:08:39,286
What's your name?

91
00:08:39,420 --> 00:08:40,988
Riley Harris.

92
00:08:42,390 --> 00:08:44,158
And how old are you?

93
00:08:44,291 --> 00:08:46,293
Fourteen.

94
00:08:46,727 --> 00:08:49,196
And how did you find out
about Cynthia?

95
00:08:50,698 --> 00:08:52,767
A woman named Agatha
told my dad

96
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:56,303
that she could help
someone like me.

97
00:08:59,508 --> 00:09:02,810
What do you mean,
someone like you?

98
00:09:05,846 --> 00:09:07,581
I see things.

99
00:09:10,351 --> 00:09:11,752
What kind of things?

100
00:09:11,986 --> 00:09:13,187
A thing.

101
00:09:15,756 --> 00:09:17,691
Can you describe
it to me?

102
00:09:19,226 --> 00:09:22,229
It's... dark,

103
00:09:22,830 --> 00:09:26,300
like a person,
but... not.

104
00:09:27,301 --> 00:09:31,605
It stares at me like
a starving dog.

105
00:09:33,674 --> 00:09:36,143
Does it speak to you, Riley?

106
00:09:38,145 --> 00:09:39,246
Yes.

107
00:09:40,181 --> 00:09:42,283
It always says the same thing.

108
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:52,993
Is it here right now?

109
00:09:55,463 --> 00:09:57,064
Can you point to it?

110
00:10:28,896 --> 00:10:31,499
Where did you get
those scars, Riley?

111
00:10:36,337 --> 00:10:37,171
Riley?

112
00:10:46,615 --> 00:10:47,715
It's here.

113
00:10:48,182 --> 00:10:50,251
It's standing right behind me.

114
00:10:50,384 --> 00:10:51,819
I can feel it.

115
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:54,088
It's hungry.

116
00:10:57,858 --> 00:10:59,193
Jordan, who's at the--

117
00:11:03,931 --> 00:11:04,932
Hey, Riley!

118
00:11:05,065 --> 00:11:06,133
-Riley!
-No!

119
00:11:06,267 --> 00:11:08,202
-Sir...
-Daddy, I need her help.

120
00:11:08,335 --> 00:11:09,571
-We can talk about this.
-We don't need your help.
Come on, let's go.

121
00:11:09,703 --> 00:11:10,871
No, let me talk to her!

122
00:11:11,005 --> 00:11:12,006
We don't
need your help.

123
00:11:12,139 --> 00:11:13,374
She can help us!
I need her help!

124
00:11:13,508 --> 00:11:14,375
Sir.

125
00:11:14,509 --> 00:11:15,544
Let's... Come here, go.

126
00:11:15,676 --> 00:11:17,646
I'm sorry for the intrusion.

127
00:11:17,778 --> 00:11:18,779
Get in the truck.

128
00:11:34,862 --> 00:11:36,130
I just don't
understand.

129
00:11:36,263 --> 00:11:38,132
I mean, she was terrified,
Mom, her arms.

130
00:11:38,265 --> 00:11:41,302
I mean, her dad's obviously
hiding something.

131
00:11:41,435 --> 00:11:44,606
She said some woman named
Agatha told her about us.

132
00:11:44,738 --> 00:11:45,940
Agatha Baker, maybe?

133
00:11:46,073 --> 00:11:48,042
Would she do that?
I don't know.

134
00:11:49,410 --> 00:11:50,512
Mom.

135
00:11:51,378 --> 00:11:53,147
You've been a little distant
throughout this whole thing.

136
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:54,982
I mean, what's going on?
Should we call the police, or...

137
00:11:55,115 --> 00:11:57,184
No, they don't need
the police involved.

138
00:11:57,318 --> 00:11:59,720
Why? I mean, something's
happening to that girl.

139
00:11:59,853 --> 00:12:01,755
There's nothing we
can do for her.

140
00:12:01,889 --> 00:12:03,390
Neither can the police.

141
00:12:04,325 --> 00:12:06,460
There are some things
that are just

142
00:12:08,663 --> 00:12:09,964
beyond help.

143
00:12:10,097 --> 00:12:11,332
Can you be straight with me
for a second?

144
00:12:11,465 --> 00:12:13,968
I mean, what even happened
back there?

145
00:12:14,502 --> 00:12:15,936
I saw something.

146
00:12:16,538 --> 00:12:18,005
What? What do you mean?

147
00:12:19,406 --> 00:12:22,176
There is something
attached to that girl,

148
00:12:22,910 --> 00:12:24,311
something terrible.

149
00:12:26,347 --> 00:12:27,448
Okay.

150
00:12:28,516 --> 00:12:32,219
Well, if you actually saw it,
doesn't that mean we can help,

151
00:12:32,353 --> 00:12:33,187
you can help her?

152
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:34,755
You know why you
do screenings

153
00:12:34,888 --> 00:12:37,491
before I meet with
any clients, right?

154
00:12:37,659 --> 00:12:38,660
Yeah, Mom, I know.

155
00:12:38,792 --> 00:12:39,994
Why?

156
00:12:40,127 --> 00:12:41,663
To decide their
psychological needs.

157
00:12:41,795 --> 00:12:44,666
If they have a willing interest
in alternative therapy,

158
00:12:44,798 --> 00:12:47,835
we decide if we're going to do
blind hypnosis or therapy.

159
00:12:47,968 --> 00:12:48,836
It's to protect them.

160
00:12:48,969 --> 00:12:50,771
And to protect us.

161
00:12:52,006 --> 00:12:54,141
Mom, if you actually
saw something

162
00:12:54,275 --> 00:12:56,343
then you're the only person
who can help that girl.

163
00:12:56,477 --> 00:12:58,078
I'm not going to open this
up to whatever it is

164
00:12:58,212 --> 00:12:59,280
that's attached to that girl!

165
00:12:59,413 --> 00:13:00,948
She had sores on her arm!
I saw it!

166
00:13:01,081 --> 00:13:01,949
She needs us, Mom!

167
00:13:02,082 --> 00:13:03,518
I don't care!

168
00:13:05,587 --> 00:13:06,987
Well, Dad would have helped.

169
00:13:07,121 --> 00:13:09,290
Okay, well, that is why your dad
is not here anymore.

170
00:13:46,026 --> 00:13:47,562
Safe to enter?

171
00:13:47,696 --> 00:13:49,863
Yeah, weapons are holstered.

172
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:54,435
Whatcha doing?

173
00:13:54,569 --> 00:13:57,539
I'm researching Larry's
past coaches.

174
00:13:57,672 --> 00:14:01,475
He had four, but this guy's
the only bald one.

175
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:08,248
Good. You send that to me?

176
00:14:08,382 --> 00:14:10,618
Yeah, it's already
in your inbox.

177
00:14:13,755 --> 00:14:17,257
Can we talk about today calmly?

178
00:14:18,158 --> 00:14:19,860
I don't know, you tell me.

179
00:14:22,296 --> 00:14:23,330
Okay.

180
00:14:24,131 --> 00:14:26,601
Today scared me.

181
00:14:28,369 --> 00:14:30,437
It reminded me of your father.

182
00:14:32,406 --> 00:14:34,408
You know, that woman
that he tried to help,

183
00:14:34,542 --> 00:14:36,176
it wasn't much different
than this.

184
00:14:36,310 --> 00:14:38,813
She also had an entity
latched on to her,

185
00:14:38,946 --> 00:14:41,014
and he just couldn't let it go.

186
00:14:41,148 --> 00:14:42,916
Because he cared about people.

187
00:14:43,417 --> 00:14:45,854
That's what made him him.
I don't blame him for that.

188
00:14:46,019 --> 00:14:49,156
He took on a lot of pain
and suffering.

189
00:14:49,923 --> 00:14:51,291
Too much.

190
00:14:52,126 --> 00:14:54,796
Whatever was attached
to that girl today,

191
00:14:55,229 --> 00:14:56,664
it isn't what we deal with.

192
00:14:56,798 --> 00:15:00,635
Mom, you've become so scared
to look inside people.

193
00:15:00,769 --> 00:15:02,236
You barely do it to
any of the patients.

194
00:15:02,369 --> 00:15:03,705
You won't even do it to me.

195
00:15:03,838 --> 00:15:05,640
I didn't need to look
inside that girl today

196
00:15:05,774 --> 00:15:07,107
to see what was attached to her.

197
00:15:07,241 --> 00:15:08,510
That makes it dangerous.

198
00:15:08,643 --> 00:15:09,811
Yeah, which is more
reason to help her.

199
00:15:09,943 --> 00:15:12,279
No, it is more reason not to.

200
00:15:13,147 --> 00:15:15,182
Say that I try, then what?

201
00:15:15,315 --> 00:15:16,851
I tell her father that
his daughter

202
00:15:16,984 --> 00:15:18,520
has an entity attached to her,

203
00:15:18,653 --> 00:15:21,790
so he can turn on us like
everyone did in Elmsboro?

204
00:15:21,922 --> 00:15:24,057
We don't know these people.

205
00:15:24,191 --> 00:15:26,059
Okay, we can't trust them.

206
00:15:30,197 --> 00:15:34,669
I don't know if you remember
how horrible it got,

207
00:15:35,202 --> 00:15:36,470
but after we moved,

208
00:15:36,604 --> 00:15:39,173
I swore I would never let
that happen again.

209
00:15:41,776 --> 00:15:45,379
The world believes in science,
not spirit.

210
00:15:46,881 --> 00:15:48,182
One day when you can see,

211
00:15:48,315 --> 00:15:50,417
I hope you have the sense
to know when to help

212
00:15:50,552 --> 00:15:52,953
and when to protect yourself.

213
00:15:53,521 --> 00:15:54,421
Okay?

214
00:15:56,558 --> 00:15:57,559
Okay.

215
00:16:40,735 --> 00:16:42,202
Daddy?

216
00:17:04,324 --> 00:17:05,760
What's the occasion?

217
00:17:06,661 --> 00:17:07,427
What?

218
00:17:07,729 --> 00:17:10,397
Saturday morning,
up before 9 a.m.?

219
00:17:10,532 --> 00:17:11,933
What have you done
with my daughter?

220
00:17:12,065 --> 00:17:14,167
I have a life outside these
four walls, Mother.

221
00:17:14,301 --> 00:17:15,870
Yeah, so what's up?

222
00:17:16,004 --> 00:17:17,872
Nothing, I think I'm just going
to park with some friends.

223
00:17:18,006 --> 00:17:21,809
-For what?
-Drinking, drugs, unprotected
sex. The usual.

224
00:17:21,943 --> 00:17:23,343
Oh, you're still mad at me.

225
00:17:23,477 --> 00:17:26,413
No, Mom. It's Saturday
and I'm 17.

226
00:17:26,548 --> 00:17:27,849
I want to do something
that doesn't involve

227
00:17:27,982 --> 00:17:30,250
depressed people. Is that okay?

228
00:17:30,384 --> 00:17:31,953
Yeah. I mean, but I'm
not depressed.

229
00:17:32,085 --> 00:17:35,924
I know. And I love you, but I
see you enough. Okay?

230
00:17:36,056 --> 00:17:37,424
Bye.

231
00:17:37,926 --> 00:17:39,661
Okay, well, be home for dinner.

232
00:17:39,794 --> 00:17:41,529
Sushi Saturday.

233
00:17:41,663 --> 00:17:43,196
I will.

234
00:18:18,666 --> 00:18:21,134
Oh, I'm so thrilled you're here.
Okay, what can I get you?

235
00:18:21,268 --> 00:18:23,103
Milk, coffee, ooh, would
you like a smoothie?

236
00:18:23,236 --> 00:18:24,706
Uh...

237
00:18:24,839 --> 00:18:27,709
Ooh, water. I can get you
a glass of water.

238
00:18:28,943 --> 00:18:30,778
Alright, here we go.

239
00:18:35,917 --> 00:18:37,619
I could order in.

240
00:18:37,752 --> 00:18:39,053
That's okay. I don't
want to take up
too much of your time.

241
00:18:39,219 --> 00:18:41,723
Oh, I've got nothing but time.

242
00:18:41,856 --> 00:18:43,490
No one really visits me.

243
00:18:44,592 --> 00:18:46,326
I was hoping your mother
was coming, too.

244
00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:48,997
No, no, she's, she's having
a solo day at home.

245
00:18:49,129 --> 00:18:50,698
Oh, yeah, of course.

246
00:18:50,832 --> 00:18:53,835
Are you, are you still looking
to follow in her footsteps?

247
00:18:53,968 --> 00:18:58,940
Mm, sometimes, yeah. Uh...

248
00:18:59,073 --> 00:19:01,341
Big shoes to fill, so...

249
00:19:01,475 --> 00:19:02,977
Such a talented woman.

250
00:19:03,911 --> 00:19:06,948
So you have a couple
of questions, or...

251
00:19:07,081 --> 00:19:10,283
Yes, I hope that's okay.
I just wanted to ask you,

252
00:19:10,417 --> 00:19:13,220
we had somebody show up
at the house yesterday.

253
00:19:13,353 --> 00:19:14,488
Yeah.

254
00:19:14,622 --> 00:19:16,024
It was a bit of a scene,
to be honest.

255
00:19:16,156 --> 00:19:17,491
I'm hoping you can help me
make some sense of it.

256
00:19:17,625 --> 00:19:21,161
A scene. Sounds spicy.

257
00:19:21,294 --> 00:19:23,064
Um, I'm not sure
how I could help,

258
00:19:23,196 --> 00:19:24,632
but please, ask away.

259
00:19:24,766 --> 00:19:28,903
Sure. Does the name Riley Harris
mean anything to you?

260
00:19:30,337 --> 00:19:34,174
Uh, no, I don't think so.

261
00:19:34,307 --> 00:19:35,610
Darn, should it?

262
00:19:37,011 --> 00:19:38,345
Maybe her father?

263
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:41,415
She mentioned she heard
you speaking to him,

264
00:19:41,549 --> 00:19:43,450
suggesting my mother might
be able to help her.

265
00:19:43,785 --> 00:19:48,488
Oh, maybe, maybe Randall Harris
from Kenilworth.

266
00:19:49,057 --> 00:19:50,591
Okay.

267
00:19:50,725 --> 00:19:52,960
I've had him restore some of my
mother's old furniture.

268
00:19:53,094 --> 00:19:55,228
Great woodworker, and cheap.

269
00:19:55,362 --> 00:19:57,431
And what can you
tell me about him?

270
00:19:57,565 --> 00:20:00,535
Oh, not much. He's polite,
you know,

271
00:20:00,668 --> 00:20:02,036
serious most of the time.

272
00:20:02,170 --> 00:20:04,505
Works out of his house,
in his garage mostly,

273
00:20:04,639 --> 00:20:08,208
you know, making tables
or whatever.

274
00:20:09,077 --> 00:20:10,678
Newly single.

275
00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:14,481
So...

276
00:20:14,615 --> 00:20:17,018
His wife passed away last year.

277
00:20:17,151 --> 00:20:18,452
Okay, what from?

278
00:20:21,089 --> 00:20:24,125
I just know the girl
took it pretty hard.

279
00:20:24,257 --> 00:20:25,827
What makes you say that?

280
00:20:27,895 --> 00:20:29,997
I don't think it's
my place to say.

281
00:20:32,867 --> 00:20:36,303
Agatha, I'm really
concerned about her.

282
00:20:36,436 --> 00:20:39,239
Anything you know
might be able to help.

283
00:20:42,977 --> 00:20:45,613
I saw some scars on her.

284
00:20:46,514 --> 00:20:48,649
Randall said they were
self-inflicted,

285
00:20:49,984 --> 00:20:51,786
so I gave him your
mother's card, right.

286
00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:54,722
But of course, I didn't say
what she really does,

287
00:20:54,856 --> 00:20:56,891
just that she's great
with trauma

288
00:20:57,024 --> 00:21:00,228
and that she can help
in that totally normal

289
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:02,530
kind of therapy way.

290
00:21:02,663 --> 00:21:03,998
Could you tell me
where his shop is?

291
00:21:04,132 --> 00:21:07,068
Yeah, I have his card
somewhere around here.

292
00:21:07,201 --> 00:21:08,102
Let me get it.

293
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:15,375
Doug Ferry. He's probably
in his sixties now.

294
00:21:15,510 --> 00:21:18,079
<i>Cynthia, unless you can</i>
<i>give me a legitimate reason</i>

295
00:21:18,212 --> 00:21:19,747
why we should suspect this man,

296
00:21:19,881 --> 00:21:21,516
I'm not going to start digging
around in this guy's past.

297
00:21:21,649 --> 00:21:25,520
You know, I can't explain, but I
don't even need to know.

298
00:21:25,653 --> 00:21:28,122
When you have time,
whenever,

299
00:21:28,488 --> 00:21:29,891
he may be worth looking into.

300
00:21:30,024 --> 00:21:31,225
I get it.

301
00:21:31,358 --> 00:21:32,392
You're good at getting hunches,

302
00:21:32,527 --> 00:21:34,629
but you never give me a reason,

303
00:21:35,196 --> 00:21:36,664
a source, nothing.

304
00:21:37,031 --> 00:21:39,100
<i>You could just be picking names</i>
<i>out of a newspaper.</i>

305
00:21:39,233 --> 00:21:40,701
You know that's not true.

306
00:21:41,769 --> 00:21:43,104
Take it or leave it, John.

307
00:21:43,237 --> 00:21:45,338
<i>See if he has anything</i>
<i>on his record.</i>

308
00:21:46,741 --> 00:21:48,341
Okay, guy's got a record.

309
00:21:48,475 --> 00:21:50,077
What do you want me
to do with this, Cynthia?

310
00:21:51,444 --> 00:21:53,948
I just know that he
is a terrible man.

311
00:21:54,682 --> 00:21:56,050
<i>Just keep an eye on him.</i>

312
00:21:56,184 --> 00:21:58,286
I got a lot of shitty people
to keep an eye on.

313
00:21:59,153 --> 00:22:01,454
Call me when you have
an actual lead.

314
00:22:15,169 --> 00:22:16,270
Prescott, come in.

315
00:22:16,403 --> 00:22:17,972
<i>Go for Prescott.</i>

316
00:22:18,606 --> 00:22:19,774
I'm sending you a name
and address.

317
00:22:19,907 --> 00:22:22,109
Can we send a car
to run surveillance?

318
00:22:22,243 --> 00:22:23,644
<i>Copy that.</i>

319
00:22:23,778 --> 00:22:25,580
<i>Anything we're looking</i>
<i>for specifically?</i>

320
00:22:27,915 --> 00:22:29,517
Just a hunch.

321
00:23:13,828 --> 00:23:16,864
I have never felt
an entity this strong.

322
00:23:17,265 --> 00:23:18,699
I can't help her.

323
00:23:19,767 --> 00:23:21,168
I'm not risking it.

324
00:23:28,309 --> 00:23:29,543
I'm not doing it.

325
00:24:32,573 --> 00:24:33,841
Can I help you?

326
00:24:34,342 --> 00:24:36,143
Sorry, you scared me.

327
00:24:36,277 --> 00:24:38,012
Can I ask why you're
looking at my house?

328
00:24:38,145 --> 00:24:39,647
Yes, sorry.

329
00:24:39,780 --> 00:24:42,316
I was at the house yesterday
with Riley.

330
00:24:42,450 --> 00:24:43,918
Yeah. No, I recognize you.

331
00:24:44,051 --> 00:24:47,121
I was just wondering if we could
talk for a minute, or...

332
00:24:48,155 --> 00:24:52,159
You know, it's not a great time.
I got a client in the shed.

333
00:24:52,293 --> 00:24:53,527
Okay, I can wait.

334
00:24:53,661 --> 00:24:55,963
It's important, so...

335
00:25:00,267 --> 00:25:01,635
Look, I get it,

336
00:25:01,769 --> 00:25:03,337
but my daughter doesn't
need to see a shrink.

337
00:25:03,471 --> 00:25:04,605
You're wasting your time here.

338
00:25:04,739 --> 00:25:06,007
I appreciate you coming out,

339
00:25:06,140 --> 00:25:07,541
but I got things under control,
thanks.

340
00:25:07,675 --> 00:25:09,076
No, no. I was thinking
she needs someone

341
00:25:09,210 --> 00:25:12,546
with a different skill set
than a shrink.

342
00:25:13,547 --> 00:25:15,182
You know, someone who can, um...

343
00:25:16,350 --> 00:25:17,952
see what she sees.

344
00:25:21,789 --> 00:25:24,225
What does she see exactly?
What did she tell you?

345
00:25:24,859 --> 00:25:27,261
Enough to get an idea of
what she's going through.

346
00:25:32,166 --> 00:25:33,834
You don't know us, or what
we've been through,

347
00:25:33,968 --> 00:25:35,870
so I recommend you mind
your own business, alright?

348
00:25:36,003 --> 00:25:38,205
Okay, can I speak
with her directly?

349
00:25:38,339 --> 00:25:39,573
She's not here.

350
00:25:39,707 --> 00:25:40,941
I'm trying to help.

351
00:28:28,342 --> 00:28:30,044
Holy shit.

352
00:29:04,044 --> 00:29:05,813
What the fuck am I doing?

353
00:29:56,330 --> 00:29:57,464
Riley.

354
00:30:26,994 --> 00:30:28,362
Riley.

355
00:30:29,631 --> 00:30:30,765
Riley, I'm just here
to talk to you.

356
00:30:30,898 --> 00:30:32,232
It's okay, you can come out.

357
00:30:33,901 --> 00:30:36,671
It's Jordan. We met yesterday.

358
00:30:38,740 --> 00:30:41,509
Come on, he can't keep you
locked down here like this.

359
00:30:56,924 --> 00:30:57,858
Riley.

360
00:31:01,462 --> 00:31:04,031
He doesn't
lock me down here.

361
00:31:04,699 --> 00:31:07,468
He locks them down here.

362
00:31:09,671 --> 00:31:10,904
Who's them?

363
00:31:14,809 --> 00:31:16,377
<i>Hello, what</i> --

364
00:31:17,411 --> 00:31:18,045
<i>Jordan?</i>

365
00:31:22,550 --> 00:31:23,484
Jordan.

366
00:31:23,618 --> 00:31:25,185
<i>Hello?</i>

367
00:31:39,299 --> 00:31:40,769
-Hello?
-Hi, Cynthia.

368
00:31:40,901 --> 00:31:42,302
Hi, Agatha. How are you?

369
00:31:42,436 --> 00:31:43,937
<i>Oh, still not</i>
<i>getting out much,</i>

370
00:31:44,071 --> 00:31:46,006
<i>but staying positive</i>
<i>and motivated</i>

371
00:31:46,140 --> 00:31:48,041
<i>and ready to break</i>
<i>out of my shell.</i>

372
00:31:48,175 --> 00:31:49,577
That's good.

373
00:31:49,711 --> 00:31:50,944
I was actually just
phoning to see if Jordan

374
00:31:51,078 --> 00:31:52,881
ended up speaking
with Mr. Harris.

375
00:31:53,013 --> 00:31:55,817
I'm sorry, Mr. Harris?

376
00:31:55,949 --> 00:31:56,851
I'm not sure who you mean.

377
00:31:56,984 --> 00:31:58,586
Randall, Randall Harris.

378
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:01,488
She stopped by earlier today
asking about his,

379
00:32:01,623 --> 00:32:04,091
his daughter. I just hope,
hoped I was helpful.

380
00:32:04,224 --> 00:32:05,426
It was really nice to see her.

381
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:08,996
What daughter, Agatha?
What did she say?

382
00:32:09,329 --> 00:32:09,963
Um.

383
00:32:10,397 --> 00:32:13,267
Oh, um, I'm. I'm sorry.

384
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:14,968
Maybe just have her call me.

385
00:32:15,102 --> 00:32:16,303
Agatha.

386
00:32:16,671 --> 00:32:18,038
Tell me what she said.

387
00:32:18,172 --> 00:32:20,207
Well, she said there was a girl

388
00:32:20,340 --> 00:32:22,242
that stopped by your house
last night,

389
00:32:22,376 --> 00:32:24,111
and she just wanted
to speak with her.

390
00:32:24,244 --> 00:32:25,880
I, I didn't think there
was an issue.

391
00:32:26,013 --> 00:32:27,114
When did this happen?

392
00:32:27,247 --> 00:32:28,716
<i>This morning.</i>

393
00:32:28,850 --> 00:32:31,185
Shit. What is the address?

394
00:32:31,318 --> 00:32:33,688
I can't really remember,
but I know where it is.

395
00:32:33,822 --> 00:32:36,691
Okay, great. I'm on my way over.
Be outside.

396
00:32:36,825 --> 00:32:38,860
<i>Sorry, you're</i>
<i>coming over?</i>

397
00:33:18,031 --> 00:33:18,933
Oh my god!

398
00:33:23,638 --> 00:33:25,573
Help!

399
00:33:26,139 --> 00:33:27,007
Help!

400
00:33:29,878 --> 00:33:30,812
Randall?

401
00:33:33,213 --> 00:33:34,147
Password.

402
00:33:34,281 --> 00:33:35,082
Randall, people know where I am.

403
00:33:35,215 --> 00:33:36,818
What's the password?

404
00:33:36,951 --> 00:33:39,587
I swear to God, I just came here
to help your daughter, okay?

405
00:33:39,721 --> 00:33:42,289
Yeah, but you can't help her,
all right? No one can.

406
00:33:42,422 --> 00:33:43,625
We've tried talking to people,

407
00:33:43,758 --> 00:33:45,392
and it always ends up
the same way,

408
00:33:45,527 --> 00:33:47,160
Child Services trying to take
my daughter from me.

409
00:33:47,294 --> 00:33:49,531
No, that's not who
my mom is, okay.

410
00:33:49,664 --> 00:33:50,999
She, she can help.

411
00:33:51,131 --> 00:33:54,134
I don't need you filling her
head full of fucking lies.

412
00:33:54,268 --> 00:33:56,236
Randall, it's the truth.
She has an ability,

413
00:33:56,370 --> 00:33:57,839
and she can help.
I know she can.

414
00:33:57,972 --> 00:33:59,841
No one can help my daughter.

415
00:34:00,675 --> 00:34:03,076
No one could help
my wife either.

416
00:34:03,210 --> 00:34:04,546
Randall, look,

417
00:34:04,679 --> 00:34:07,515
I promise you that we can
find out what it wants

418
00:34:07,649 --> 00:34:09,116
and we can get it
to leave you both.

419
00:34:09,249 --> 00:34:10,785
I promise.

420
00:34:12,820 --> 00:34:15,455
We know what it wants.

421
00:34:17,457 --> 00:34:18,993
Oh, no, no, no, no.

422
00:34:21,629 --> 00:34:25,600
She needs to feed it,
or it'll feed on her.

423
00:34:31,573 --> 00:34:32,740
Riley?

424
00:34:37,077 --> 00:34:37,946
Riley.

425
00:34:41,849 --> 00:34:43,017
Sorry.

426
00:34:43,150 --> 00:34:44,151
Riley.

427
00:35:13,681 --> 00:35:15,482
Riley, good job.

428
00:35:15,917 --> 00:35:16,884
Okay.

429
00:35:17,585 --> 00:35:18,686
Okay.

430
00:35:18,820 --> 00:35:20,788
Good job.
Go upstairs for me, okay.

431
00:35:20,922 --> 00:35:23,658
Okay. Thank you, Jordan.

432
00:35:25,459 --> 00:35:27,227
Go on, go ahead. Good job.

433
00:35:44,211 --> 00:35:46,179
<i>Hey, it's</i>
<i>Jordan, leave a message.</i>

434
00:35:46,313 --> 00:35:48,215
<i>If people still do that.</i>

435
00:35:54,421 --> 00:35:57,792
Oh, hello. Hi.

436
00:36:03,163 --> 00:36:04,766
So what are we doing?

437
00:36:04,899 --> 00:36:07,334
I don't get out much.
This is kind of exciting.

438
00:36:07,467 --> 00:36:09,336
I think that Jordan
might be in trouble.

439
00:36:09,837 --> 00:36:12,239
Because of Randall?
Oh, come on.

440
00:36:13,775 --> 00:36:15,677
Okay, well, you can
drive like a maniac,

441
00:36:15,810 --> 00:36:19,179
but absolutely no texting
at the wheel.

442
00:36:19,547 --> 00:36:21,015
See, look, she's fine.

443
00:36:21,149 --> 00:36:23,751
"Just hanging out with friends,
Mom, don't wait up."

444
00:36:24,317 --> 00:36:24,952
What?

445
00:36:25,086 --> 00:36:26,688
She's...

446
00:36:27,121 --> 00:36:28,455
It's not like her.

447
00:36:28,823 --> 00:36:30,091
We had plans.

448
00:36:30,223 --> 00:36:31,859
Grown daughter doesn't want
to spend Saturday night

449
00:36:31,993 --> 00:36:34,194
with her mom? Shocking.

450
00:36:44,371 --> 00:36:45,640
Dad.

451
00:36:46,007 --> 00:36:47,942
Alright, hurry up. Get, get her
in the truck, alright?

452
00:36:48,076 --> 00:36:49,544
Look, we need to sink the car
and get out of here.

453
00:36:49,677 --> 00:36:50,845
We're running out of time.

454
00:36:50,978 --> 00:36:52,647
Can't we just see if her mom
can help?

455
00:36:52,780 --> 00:36:55,116
She is different
from the others.

456
00:36:55,248 --> 00:36:56,450
People will be looking for her,
and if they find her, they will
take you for me forever.

457
00:36:56,584 --> 00:36:57,685
Is that what you want?

458
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:00,088
Are we going to Brookers Lake?

459
00:37:00,220 --> 00:37:01,388
Do you have everything you need?

460
00:37:01,856 --> 00:37:03,356
Yeah, I just need
to grab my backpack.

461
00:37:03,490 --> 00:37:05,026
Alright, hurry up.
Hey, hey.

462
00:37:06,359 --> 00:37:07,695
Don't go to the basement.

463
00:37:07,829 --> 00:37:09,664
We'll feed it together
before I leave, okay?

464
00:37:09,797 --> 00:37:10,397
Go. Hurry up.

465
00:37:15,136 --> 00:37:16,236
Come on.

466
00:37:19,674 --> 00:37:20,641
Fuck.

467
00:37:20,975 --> 00:37:22,777
Kill me.

468
00:37:23,211 --> 00:37:24,612
No, don't say that.

469
00:37:24,746 --> 00:37:27,014
We're going to get out
of this, okay?

470
00:37:30,852 --> 00:37:32,019
Ow!

471
00:37:35,156 --> 00:37:36,124
Okay.

472
00:37:36,423 --> 00:37:37,457
Riley.

473
00:37:37,592 --> 00:37:39,259
Did she really see it?

474
00:37:39,392 --> 00:37:41,428
Yeah, yeah, Riley.

475
00:37:41,562 --> 00:37:44,232
And if you let me out, then
I can take you to her.

476
00:37:44,364 --> 00:37:46,033
She can help us, okay?

477
00:37:46,634 --> 00:37:48,368
You can't get my dad
in trouble, okay?

478
00:37:48,503 --> 00:37:50,571
He's just trying to protect me.

479
00:37:50,705 --> 00:37:52,140
If your mom can make me better,

480
00:37:52,272 --> 00:37:55,109
my dad can be a good person
again. I promise you.

481
00:37:55,243 --> 00:37:58,311
I know. I know, Riley, okay.

482
00:38:00,047 --> 00:38:01,149
Come on, please.

483
00:38:04,152 --> 00:38:05,086
Thank you.

484
00:38:06,521 --> 00:38:08,523
I'll try to keep him
busy outside.

485
00:38:17,364 --> 00:38:18,966
Oh, shit, Riley!

486
00:38:23,871 --> 00:38:25,338
Come on, come on,
come on.

487
00:38:25,472 --> 00:38:26,741
Come on, come on, come on.

488
00:38:28,341 --> 00:38:30,011
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

489
00:38:31,879 --> 00:38:34,715
Come on, come on, come on,
come on, come on.

490
00:38:35,315 --> 00:38:36,217
Oh!

491
00:38:42,223 --> 00:38:43,323
No, no, no, no.

492
00:38:44,725 --> 00:38:48,729
God, come on, come on, come on!

493
00:39:02,409 --> 00:39:04,745
Ready? Okay.

494
00:39:04,879 --> 00:39:05,847
Oh, fuck!

495
00:39:10,985 --> 00:39:12,019
I'll go get help.

496
00:39:12,820 --> 00:39:14,055
Oh!

497
00:39:17,525 --> 00:39:18,926
Randall.

498
00:39:20,228 --> 00:39:22,196
You don't have to do this, okay?

499
00:39:22,330 --> 00:39:23,664
She needs help.

500
00:39:24,198 --> 00:39:25,166
We can help her.

501
00:39:25,299 --> 00:39:26,300
You shouldn't have come here.

502
00:39:26,433 --> 00:39:28,069
Dad, Dad, Dad, stop!

503
00:39:28,202 --> 00:39:29,469
Riley, stay out of this.

504
00:39:29,604 --> 00:39:31,205
You heard what she said.
She can help us.

505
00:39:31,339 --> 00:39:34,942
You can't keep hurting people!
I don't want to do this anymore.

506
00:39:35,076 --> 00:39:36,544
Riley, Riley, move, okay?

507
00:39:36,677 --> 00:39:37,812
Daddy--
-Move out of the way.

508
00:39:37,945 --> 00:39:40,281
No, you don't kill people.
You said!

509
00:39:40,413 --> 00:39:41,414
Riley, move!

510
00:39:49,389 --> 00:39:52,126
Riley. Riley?

511
00:39:52,860 --> 00:39:54,461
Riley. Come on, breathe!
Riley

512
00:39:58,633 --> 00:40:00,500
Riley, come on!
No, don't, don't!

513
00:40:00,635 --> 00:40:02,435
Riley!

514
00:40:05,306 --> 00:40:06,807
Riley, Riley.

515
00:40:11,846 --> 00:40:12,880
Oh.

516
00:41:00,361 --> 00:41:02,229
Help me, somebody!

517
00:41:02,363 --> 00:41:03,831
No. No!

518
00:41:03,965 --> 00:41:06,734
No, no, no, no, no, Riley.

519
00:41:07,368 --> 00:41:10,237
Baby. Riley, Riley, Riley.

520
00:41:10,371 --> 00:41:11,706
No!

521
00:41:12,406 --> 00:41:13,341
Okay.

522
00:41:13,473 --> 00:41:14,342
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay.

523
00:41:14,474 --> 00:41:15,443
No, no, no, no, no, no.

524
00:41:15,576 --> 00:41:16,544
It's okay.

525
00:41:18,713 --> 00:41:20,348
Fuck!

526
00:41:34,962 --> 00:41:36,998
Jordan! Jordan! Baby!

527
00:41:37,131 --> 00:41:39,533
Mom! Mom!

528
00:41:40,568 --> 00:41:42,670
Mom!

529
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:13,834
It's going to be fine.

530
00:42:14,702 --> 00:42:15,970
It's going to be fine.

531
00:42:20,708 --> 00:42:21,675
We're just finishing up
with her.

532
00:42:21,809 --> 00:42:23,177
They shouldn't be much longer.

533
00:42:23,310 --> 00:42:25,746
Did they find the girl
at the house?

534
00:42:26,313 --> 00:42:27,615
Yeah, they did. Um...

535
00:42:28,249 --> 00:42:30,484
They brought her body to
Commongrove Hospital.

536
00:42:30,985 --> 00:42:32,153
Staff's pretty shaken up.

537
00:42:32,286 --> 00:42:33,888
I guess some of them
knew Riley Harris

538
00:42:34,021 --> 00:42:35,990
from when her mother was sick.

539
00:42:38,125 --> 00:42:39,260
You should know,

540
00:42:41,762 --> 00:42:44,231
forensics is finding remains
at the house.

541
00:42:44,732 --> 00:42:46,634
This guy's been doing it
for a while.

542
00:42:47,435 --> 00:42:49,203
Jordan's lucky to have escaped.

543
00:42:49,437 --> 00:42:50,539
Randall, and Randall,

544
00:42:50,671 --> 00:42:52,507
did they, have they found him?

545
00:42:52,640 --> 00:42:55,009
No sign. I bet he's three
counties away by now.
But we've run his plates,

546
00:42:55,142 --> 00:42:58,145
and we've gotten every precinct
in area out searching.

547
00:42:58,279 --> 00:42:59,548
We'll find him.

548
00:42:59,880 --> 00:43:01,715
Hold tight.

549
00:43:06,754 --> 00:43:08,222
I mean, this probably
isn't the time. But,

550
00:43:08,355 --> 00:43:10,691
I thought you should know,
your hunch about the coach

551
00:43:10,825 --> 00:43:12,193
may have been right.

552
00:43:12,326 --> 00:43:14,829
We just brought Doug Ferry
in for questioning.

553
00:43:14,962 --> 00:43:17,465
I can't say much, but
surveillance shows

554
00:43:17,598 --> 00:43:19,066
some cause for concern.

555
00:43:26,674 --> 00:43:28,008
One more time.

556
00:43:28,142 --> 00:43:30,945
How'd you get these
sores on your arms?

557
00:43:32,313 --> 00:43:36,117
Oh, he attacked me

558
00:43:36,250 --> 00:43:41,055
so friction from struggling,
I guess.

559
00:43:41,188 --> 00:43:43,090
This was after
he fired the rifle?

560
00:43:43,224 --> 00:43:47,094
Yeah, I punched him
in the throat

561
00:43:48,829 --> 00:43:49,763
and I escaped.

562
00:43:49,897 --> 00:43:51,165
I know you're tired, Jordan.

563
00:43:51,298 --> 00:43:53,801
We're just trying to
make sense of this.

564
00:43:55,636 --> 00:43:57,071
I've told you everything.

565
00:43:57,471 --> 00:44:01,408
Last word is forensics found
remains in the backyard

566
00:44:01,543 --> 00:44:02,676
under the woodshed.

567
00:44:03,344 --> 00:44:04,879
This is one of the most
horrific crime scenes

568
00:44:05,012 --> 00:44:06,747
we have ever encountered,
Jordan.

569
00:44:06,881 --> 00:44:09,250
You're our best way
of finding this guy.

570
00:44:09,383 --> 00:44:11,652
Is there anything at all that
you're not telling us?

571
00:44:11,785 --> 00:44:13,087
Anything?

572
00:44:42,116 --> 00:44:44,018
I think I need to go home.

573
00:44:45,419 --> 00:44:46,387
Please.

574
00:44:47,721 --> 00:44:48,689
Okay.

575
00:44:56,531 --> 00:44:59,867
We'll have a car stationed
outside of your
house tonight, okay?

576
00:45:01,202 --> 00:45:02,203
Jordan.

577
00:45:02,336 --> 00:45:02,836
Hey, baby.

578
00:45:04,338 --> 00:45:06,173
Hey, you're okay.

579
00:45:08,610 --> 00:45:11,979
Mom, I'm not okay.

580
00:45:13,080 --> 00:45:14,281
Okay, let's go home.

581
00:45:19,386 --> 00:45:21,556
Please, Agatha,
you really don't have to.

582
00:45:21,690 --> 00:45:24,825
No, I insist. I am here to help.

583
00:45:24,959 --> 00:45:27,428
What, what can I do?
Tea, coffee?

584
00:45:27,562 --> 00:45:29,230
Tea would be good.

585
00:45:29,363 --> 00:45:30,931
Tea, okay.

586
00:45:36,437 --> 00:45:38,372
Mom, I'm sorry. I didn't
know what I was--

587
00:45:38,506 --> 00:45:39,807
Jordan, I told you.

588
00:45:40,609 --> 00:45:43,277
I said that we cannot open
ourselves up to this.

589
00:45:43,410 --> 00:45:45,346
I know, Mom, but I couldn't
just let her go.

590
00:45:45,479 --> 00:45:46,847
And look what happened!

591
00:45:47,549 --> 00:45:48,949
I cannot believe you.

592
00:45:49,083 --> 00:45:52,886
Mom, I'm seeing it.

593
00:45:56,223 --> 00:46:02,196
No, you have been through
a traumatic experience.

594
00:46:02,329 --> 00:46:05,499
She died in my arms, Mom.
I watched it leave her.

595
00:46:05,634 --> 00:46:07,535
And I can feel it, okay?

596
00:46:07,669 --> 00:46:09,470
I would sense it
if it was there.

597
00:46:09,604 --> 00:46:13,774
Mom, I need you to look
inside me, okay?

598
00:46:13,907 --> 00:46:15,209
I need you to see
that it's there.

599
00:46:15,342 --> 00:46:16,443
Jordan.

600
00:46:16,578 --> 00:46:19,480
I know why
you're afraid to look.

601
00:46:19,614 --> 00:46:21,482
You're afraid of seeing Dad.

602
00:46:22,182 --> 00:46:23,484
We share the same trauma,

603
00:46:23,618 --> 00:46:25,152
and it doesn't matter
if you look or not.

604
00:46:25,286 --> 00:46:27,988
It's not going to stop.
Look at my arm, Mom.

605
00:46:28,122 --> 00:46:29,990
This is real!

606
00:46:37,632 --> 00:46:38,700
You're a coward.

607
00:46:45,607 --> 00:46:48,108
You're afraid of something
in her mind.

608
00:46:52,146 --> 00:46:55,316
Oh. A smart woman
once told me

609
00:46:55,449 --> 00:46:58,419
that the only way to overcome
fear is to face it.

610
00:47:01,188 --> 00:47:03,692
You've spent so many years
trying to help other people

611
00:47:03,824 --> 00:47:07,094
that you've never
helped yourself.

612
00:47:09,330 --> 00:47:13,067
Whatever trauma you're afraid
of seeing inside her,

613
00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:16,036
you've already been
through worse.

614
00:47:20,974 --> 00:47:22,910
Sounds like she needs you now.

615
00:47:27,881 --> 00:47:29,818
Agatha, I don't know
how this will go,

616
00:47:29,950 --> 00:47:34,421
so if you see me struggling,

617
00:47:35,389 --> 00:47:36,558
wake me up.

618
00:47:38,926 --> 00:47:39,728
Agatha.

619
00:47:39,860 --> 00:47:41,995
Oh. Oh, sorry. Yes.

620
00:47:42,129 --> 00:47:45,032
You've done this to me,
but I have never seen you
do it to someone else.

621
00:47:45,165 --> 00:47:46,467
Did you hear me?

622
00:47:47,201 --> 00:47:50,204
Yes. Wake you up if you're
struggling. Got it.

623
00:47:51,004 --> 00:47:51,740
Thank you.

624
00:47:51,872 --> 00:47:53,541
Okay. Okay.

625
00:47:55,810 --> 00:47:56,745
Okay.

626
00:47:59,079 --> 00:48:00,948
This won't be pleasant.

627
00:48:02,550 --> 00:48:04,586
If an entity has attached
itself to you,

628
00:48:04,719 --> 00:48:08,088
it will be the weakest
part of your mind

629
00:48:08,922 --> 00:48:10,991
where you hold the most pain.

630
00:48:12,827 --> 00:48:14,596
I need to go there to find it.

631
00:48:15,963 --> 00:48:17,331
Okay.

632
00:48:17,464 --> 00:48:18,465
I love you, Mom.

633
00:48:20,200 --> 00:48:21,803
I love you too.

634
00:48:24,037 --> 00:48:26,875
Okay, now breathe.

635
00:48:27,307 --> 00:48:30,177
Just do whatever
you can to relax.

636
00:48:30,310 --> 00:48:32,479
Right, relax. Okay.

637
00:50:23,190 --> 00:50:24,626
Mom?

638
00:50:25,092 --> 00:50:26,794
Do you want to come
inside with me?

639
00:50:29,597 --> 00:50:31,699
It's okay, you don't have to.

640
00:50:47,749 --> 00:50:50,985
Oh, honey, it's okay.
It's going to be okay.

641
00:52:05,325 --> 00:52:07,361
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.

642
00:52:07,494 --> 00:52:09,196
Cynthia, Cynthia, wake up.

643
00:52:09,329 --> 00:52:10,632
Cynthia, wake up!

644
00:52:11,566 --> 00:52:12,499
Ah!

645
00:52:19,139 --> 00:52:20,808
A shake would have sufficed.

646
00:52:21,809 --> 00:52:22,910
I'm so sorry.

647
00:52:23,878 --> 00:52:25,479
I panicked.

648
00:52:28,950 --> 00:52:30,183
Oh.

649
00:52:56,978 --> 00:52:58,178
She's asleep.

650
00:52:58,311 --> 00:52:59,246
Oh.

651
00:52:59,379 --> 00:53:01,314
Probably for a while.

652
00:53:02,116 --> 00:53:03,283
Poor kid.

653
00:53:03,417 --> 00:53:06,854
Thank you for being here.
I appreciate it.

654
00:53:08,656 --> 00:53:11,224
Is there any way you could
stick around for a bit longer?

655
00:53:11,358 --> 00:53:12,627
I need to do something,
and I just,

656
00:53:12,760 --> 00:53:14,529
I don't want her to be alone
if she wakes up.

657
00:53:14,662 --> 00:53:17,364
Oh, yeah, I can. I can.
I can do that.

658
00:53:17,497 --> 00:53:20,400
I can, I'll just read.

659
00:53:20,535 --> 00:53:22,436
Okay. Well, there's an officer
stationed outside

660
00:53:22,570 --> 00:53:25,773
if you need anything.
Call me if she wakes up,

661
00:53:26,974 --> 00:53:27,875
Okay.

662
00:53:47,095 --> 00:53:48,062
Larry.

663
00:53:51,599 --> 00:53:54,168
Doctor Winstone, what
are you doing here?

664
00:53:54,301 --> 00:53:57,972
Hey, um, I know I shouldn't
be here

665
00:53:58,106 --> 00:53:59,372
talking to you out of session,

666
00:53:59,507 --> 00:54:01,274
but I really need your help.

667
00:54:01,408 --> 00:54:02,744
I know you can't share
patient information,

668
00:54:02,877 --> 00:54:05,079
but I just need to know
the doctor

669
00:54:05,213 --> 00:54:07,749
who dealt with a woman
with the last name Harris.

670
00:54:07,882 --> 00:54:10,151
She passed away here last year.

671
00:54:10,752 --> 00:54:13,453
I would not ask you if
I wasn't desperate.

672
00:54:17,290 --> 00:54:18,358
-Harris, right?
-Yes.

673
00:54:24,832 --> 00:54:28,970
Oh, yeah, I remember this.
Samantha Harris.

674
00:54:29,737 --> 00:54:31,105
Really? You remember her?

675
00:54:31,239 --> 00:54:33,373
Mm-hmm, yeah, it was like
a really big deal here.

676
00:54:33,508 --> 00:54:36,811
Like a flesh eating disease,
really upsetting.

677
00:54:36,944 --> 00:54:39,714
Doctor Whitaker was the lead,
but he retired.

678
00:54:39,847 --> 00:54:41,783
Is there any way you could
get me his number?

679
00:54:58,498 --> 00:55:01,536
I have a client who
may be dealing with an illness

680
00:55:01,669 --> 00:55:03,771
similar to one of your patients,

681
00:55:04,437 --> 00:55:06,473
Samantha Harris.

682
00:55:09,977 --> 00:55:13,915
You have a client showing
the same symptoms?

683
00:55:14,048 --> 00:55:16,617
Yes. You remember her?

684
00:55:20,521 --> 00:55:21,989
What can you tell me about her?

685
00:55:22,857 --> 00:55:27,628
Well, not much, as it's
patient confidentiality.

686
00:55:27,762 --> 00:55:29,797
Please. My client
is getting worse,

687
00:55:29,931 --> 00:55:33,034
and you are the only
person that has
any experience with this.

688
00:55:34,135 --> 00:55:35,636
I know we work
in different fields,

689
00:55:35,770 --> 00:55:38,005
but I'm asking you
doctor to doctor.

690
00:55:38,806 --> 00:55:41,776
She's running out of time,
and I need to help her.

691
00:55:47,648 --> 00:55:52,419
The disease she had
was unique, aggressive.

692
00:55:52,553 --> 00:55:55,189
She was a humanitarian nurse,

693
00:55:55,790 --> 00:55:57,457
long stretches overseas.

694
00:55:57,592 --> 00:56:02,462
She came in with her husband
and her daughter.

695
00:56:02,597 --> 00:56:05,566
She was deteriorating
so quickly.

696
00:56:05,700 --> 00:56:08,501
After two weeks,
her hair fell out,

697
00:56:08,636 --> 00:56:11,939
then her teeth, her nails.

698
00:56:12,607 --> 00:56:14,642
It was like she was rotting.

699
00:56:14,775 --> 00:56:17,979
But not just on the outside,
on the inside, too,

700
00:56:18,112 --> 00:56:22,884
from her bones to
her organs, just...

701
00:56:23,618 --> 00:56:25,452
Did she say anything to you

702
00:56:25,586 --> 00:56:27,555
about what she thought
it could be?

703
00:56:27,989 --> 00:56:30,892
About three weeks in,
she could see

704
00:56:31,025 --> 00:56:34,461
that I was distraught,
and I was.

705
00:56:34,595 --> 00:56:36,496
I was a mess.

706
00:56:36,631 --> 00:56:40,034
Not in 40 years had I seen
anything like it.

707
00:56:40,167 --> 00:56:44,672
I was about to lose her, and I
didn't even know what it was.

708
00:56:44,906 --> 00:56:50,044
So this night, near the end,

709
00:56:51,045 --> 00:56:56,083
she asked me to come close
and she whispers,

710
00:56:59,419 --> 00:57:02,056
Something has me.

711
00:57:04,892 --> 00:57:08,796
It's here with us right now.

712
00:57:11,565 --> 00:57:13,034
It's hungry.

713
00:57:15,536 --> 00:57:16,971
I can show you.

714
00:57:17,305 --> 00:57:20,741
She reached out
her hand and she said,

715
00:57:20,875 --> 00:57:25,613
"Don't be scared. It's worse
if you're afraid."

716
00:57:27,682 --> 00:57:31,686
I could feel it pulling,

717
00:57:32,420 --> 00:57:37,892
every part of my body being
sucked towards her.

718
00:57:38,326 --> 00:57:42,430
It defied any scientific theory
I could come up with.

719
00:57:43,297 --> 00:57:45,666
She needed me to see
that this was beyond

720
00:57:45,800 --> 00:57:49,103
anything the medicine
could help.

721
00:57:51,405 --> 00:57:53,641
It was her way of saying

722
00:57:54,809 --> 00:57:56,476
thank you for trying.

723
00:58:15,029 --> 00:58:17,965
After that, I couldn't
go back in.

724
00:58:19,400 --> 00:58:23,037
Her daughter stayed with her
for the final days.

725
00:58:24,438 --> 00:58:27,274
She held her hand
till she passed.

726
00:58:27,775 --> 00:58:30,244
Do you believe that something
was with her?

727
00:58:30,378 --> 00:58:34,015
I hope you understand why I
can't answer that, Cynthia.

728
00:58:36,283 --> 00:58:37,985
But I'll tell you this.

729
00:58:42,156 --> 00:58:46,160
If your client is suffering from
the same symptoms,

730
00:58:46,293 --> 00:58:50,231
then she's better off being
helped by someone like you

731
00:58:50,865 --> 00:58:54,468
than someone like me.

732
00:59:57,765 --> 01:00:00,935
Feed me!

733
01:00:01,268 --> 01:00:04,105
No, no.

734
01:00:42,676 --> 01:00:44,145
Cynthia?

735
01:00:49,150 --> 01:00:50,351
Oh.

736
01:01:21,115 --> 01:01:22,383
Mom?

737
01:02:46,800 --> 01:02:48,135
Mom?

738
01:03:12,527 --> 01:03:14,795
Oh, oh.

739
01:03:30,444 --> 01:03:31,412
Agatha?

740
01:03:32,514 --> 01:03:33,581
Agatha.

741
01:03:33,715 --> 01:03:35,717
Agatha, wake up.
Agatha, wake up.

742
01:03:35,849 --> 01:03:38,118
Hey, hey, hey. Wake up. Okay.

743
01:03:38,252 --> 01:03:39,788
There you go. Okay.

744
01:03:39,920 --> 01:03:41,355
Are you okay?

745
01:03:41,488 --> 01:03:42,456
Ow.

746
01:03:42,590 --> 01:03:44,659
Agatha, what happened?
Look at me.

747
01:03:44,793 --> 01:03:45,859
What happened?

748
01:03:45,993 --> 01:03:48,763
There's somebody, somebody...

749
01:03:48,896 --> 01:03:49,930
Somebody was here. Somebody.

750
01:03:50,064 --> 01:03:51,398
Jordan! Jordan!

751
01:03:51,533 --> 01:03:52,499
Jordan!

752
01:03:53,334 --> 01:03:54,468
Jordan!

753
01:03:55,469 --> 01:03:56,604
Jordan!

754
01:03:58,472 --> 01:03:59,607
No!

755
01:04:00,441 --> 01:04:04,345
She's gone! She's gone!
She's gone!

756
01:04:04,478 --> 01:04:06,648
Assistance needed at the
Winstone house!

757
01:04:23,964 --> 01:04:25,399
I'm so sorry, Cynthia.

758
01:04:25,533 --> 01:04:27,234
I get the police. This is
not your fault.

759
01:04:27,368 --> 01:04:32,072
I just, we, we just need
to find her.

760
01:04:32,206 --> 01:04:34,007
We have everyone
we can looking.

761
01:04:34,141 --> 01:04:36,644
Local news, phone alerts,
everything.

762
01:04:36,778 --> 01:04:37,779
We'll find her.

763
01:06:08,770 --> 01:06:10,705
Hey, don't move! Don't move!

764
01:06:18,378 --> 01:06:22,517
Randall, come on. You don't
have to do this.

765
01:06:24,586 --> 01:06:27,689
You know, I didn't mean for
her to get hurt. I'm sorry.

766
01:06:27,988 --> 01:06:29,456
This isn't about her.

767
01:06:30,625 --> 01:06:34,027
Or you, not anymore.
This is about it.

768
01:06:35,229 --> 01:06:37,665
You held her when she died.

769
01:06:39,901 --> 01:06:41,669
And now it's inside you.

770
01:06:44,137 --> 01:06:45,439
And now,

771
01:06:48,810 --> 01:06:50,712
no one's going to be
around when you die.

772
01:06:52,514 --> 01:06:54,147
So it can starve,

773
01:06:54,582 --> 01:06:59,286
or it can go back to wherever
the fuck it came from.

774
01:06:59,954 --> 01:07:01,923
No. No!

775
01:07:11,265 --> 01:07:13,935
Let me out!
I'm sorry!

776
01:07:14,067 --> 01:07:15,770
Let me out!

777
01:07:19,507 --> 01:07:21,943
No, no, no, no, no, no!

778
01:07:23,912 --> 01:07:25,513
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

779
01:07:28,181 --> 01:07:31,686
No, no, come on, please!
I'm so sorry!

780
01:07:45,967 --> 01:07:47,501
Starve.

781
01:08:09,489 --> 01:08:12,292
I think we shouldjust
try to stay positive.

782
01:08:18,833 --> 01:08:20,034
Anything?

783
01:08:20,167 --> 01:08:21,603
The team is almost
done at the house,

784
01:08:21,736 --> 01:08:23,037
and I have a few more questions

785
01:08:23,170 --> 01:08:24,137
and then you can head home.

786
01:08:24,271 --> 01:08:25,472
Yeah, I'm not going home.

787
01:08:25,607 --> 01:08:27,341
We need to be out
there searching.

788
01:08:27,474 --> 01:08:29,911
We are searching. We just
need you close in case--

789
01:08:30,044 --> 01:08:33,014
I am not sitting around when
my daughter is out there.

790
01:08:33,146 --> 01:08:35,315
Cynthia, please just--

791
01:08:36,316 --> 01:08:37,451
Wait here.

792
01:08:40,253 --> 01:08:41,188
What's going on?

793
01:08:41,321 --> 01:08:43,024
It's him, he just pulled up.

794
01:08:43,156 --> 01:08:44,491
What?

795
01:08:44,626 --> 01:08:46,861
It's Randall Harris.
He's turned himself in.

796
01:08:46,995 --> 01:08:47,895
And the girl?

797
01:08:56,104 --> 01:08:58,238
Where is she?! Randall!

798
01:08:58,372 --> 01:09:00,273
Where is my daughter?!

799
01:09:00,842 --> 01:09:02,376
Where is she?!

800
01:09:02,977 --> 01:09:04,078
Just let me talk to him.

801
01:09:04,211 --> 01:09:05,178
I'm sorry, I can't
let you do that.

802
01:09:05,312 --> 01:09:07,180
Please, John, you know me.

803
01:09:07,314 --> 01:09:09,083
You know I can get
through to people.

804
01:09:09,216 --> 01:09:10,484
Don't ask me to do that, okay?

805
01:09:10,618 --> 01:09:11,853
It's so against protocol.

806
01:09:11,986 --> 01:09:15,123
I don't give fuck about
your protocol.

807
01:09:15,255 --> 01:09:16,891
This is my daughter.

808
01:09:17,025 --> 01:09:21,361
John, just get me in the room.

809
01:09:22,362 --> 01:09:24,331
Minutes from now, we could
know where she is.

810
01:09:24,464 --> 01:09:26,668
But if I don't talk to him,

811
01:09:27,200 --> 01:09:29,403
we might not ever find her.

812
01:09:29,537 --> 01:09:32,272
You are making this decision.

813
01:09:33,641 --> 01:09:35,877
You know I can do this.

814
01:09:36,978 --> 01:09:38,445
Just trust me.

815
01:09:40,682 --> 01:09:41,749
I'm sorry.

816
01:09:47,789 --> 01:09:48,856
God.

817
01:09:51,025 --> 01:09:53,961
Please, please.

818
01:10:57,225 --> 01:10:58,458
What's going on with him?

819
01:10:58,993 --> 01:11:01,294
Remember the two Sawyer kids
that went missing last year?

820
01:11:01,428 --> 01:11:02,563
What about them?

821
01:11:02,697 --> 01:11:04,165
I think we just found them.

822
01:11:23,584 --> 01:11:25,285
You're not going to have
long in there.

823
01:11:32,093 --> 01:11:33,928
Please don't let me regret this.

824
01:11:38,566 --> 01:11:39,934
Where is she?

825
01:11:40,067 --> 01:11:43,604
It won't hurt anyone else.
It stops now, okay?

826
01:11:43,738 --> 01:11:44,572
Fine.

827
01:11:45,907 --> 01:11:48,643
No, no, stop, stop, stop, stop!

828
01:11:48,776 --> 01:11:50,443
Help! Somebody help! Help me!

829
01:12:19,207 --> 01:12:20,641
Deeper.

830
01:13:27,808 --> 01:13:28,943
No.

831
01:13:30,044 --> 01:13:30,578
Leave!

832
01:13:30,711 --> 01:13:32,546
Show me, Randall!

833
01:13:32,680 --> 01:13:34,215
Show me where she is!

834
01:14:06,847 --> 01:14:09,884
No, you have to leave her.

835
01:14:10,618 --> 01:14:12,186
Get out of my head!

836
01:14:24,865 --> 01:14:26,067
No.

837
01:14:26,534 --> 01:14:28,169
No, you can't find her.

838
01:14:28,302 --> 01:14:31,505
You have to leave her.
She has to die.

839
01:14:32,740 --> 01:14:34,709
She has to die. Listen to me.

840
01:14:34,842 --> 01:14:36,177
What is it? What just happened?

841
01:14:36,310 --> 01:14:38,112
He buried her in the woods.

842
01:14:38,245 --> 01:14:39,580
What? Where?

843
01:14:39,714 --> 01:14:42,383
Leave her! It'll keep going!

844
01:14:42,516 --> 01:14:43,751
Where are you--

845
01:14:43,884 --> 01:14:44,885
I have to go.
They'll call you a cab.

846
01:14:49,457 --> 01:14:51,491
Put the word out. We're looking
for wooded areas

847
01:14:51,625 --> 01:14:53,127
in the direction Randall
was driving from.

848
01:14:53,260 --> 01:14:55,029
I want search parties
to organize now.

849
01:15:03,170 --> 01:15:04,171
I'm coming with you.

850
01:15:08,275 --> 01:15:09,610
Let's go.

851
01:15:16,584 --> 01:15:18,119
Fucking hell.

852
01:15:23,591 --> 01:15:27,828
Feed me.

853
01:15:40,007 --> 01:15:41,642
Where are we going?

854
01:15:42,209 --> 01:15:43,512
I don't know.

855
01:15:43,711 --> 01:15:45,446
I just know it's this way.

856
01:15:51,919 --> 01:15:54,355
Find me Cynthia Winstone's
plates. I want an APB out.

857
01:15:54,488 --> 01:15:58,125
She went east. Find me any
wooded areas in that direction.

858
01:16:00,995 --> 01:16:03,664
There, we're close.
I remember this.

859
01:16:06,333 --> 01:16:07,902
If you think
she's here,

860
01:16:08,035 --> 01:16:10,237
shouldn't we call the police
and let them know?

861
01:16:10,371 --> 01:16:11,839
The police cannot help her.

862
01:16:13,040 --> 01:16:14,275
Can we?

863
01:16:14,775 --> 01:16:17,178
I don't know, but we
have to try.

864
01:16:17,478 --> 01:16:19,447
I want units searching
any the entrances

865
01:16:19,580 --> 01:16:20,714
to forested areas.

866
01:16:20,848 --> 01:16:22,016
Look for fresh tire tracks,

867
01:16:22,149 --> 01:16:24,018
and any sign of Cynthia's car.

868
01:16:24,151 --> 01:16:25,619
<i>Copy that.</i>
<i>We have units on route.</i>

869
01:16:33,661 --> 01:16:34,862
We're almost there.

870
01:16:34,995 --> 01:16:36,297
What are we gonna find?

871
01:16:36,430 --> 01:16:38,232
When we get there,
I need you to trust me.

872
01:16:39,633 --> 01:16:40,935
Yeah.

873
01:16:41,769 --> 01:16:43,538
Whatever I can do to help.

874
01:16:44,038 --> 01:16:45,239
You're a good friend, Agatha.

875
01:16:48,709 --> 01:16:49,544
There.

876
01:17:12,601 --> 01:17:13,667
Take it.

877
01:17:18,806 --> 01:17:19,940
Sorry, she's--

878
01:17:20,074 --> 01:17:23,578
Yes, Agatha, dig! Dig!

879
01:17:23,711 --> 01:17:25,146
Okay, okay, okay.

880
01:17:30,718 --> 01:17:33,487
<i>Hey, Dispatch,</i>
<i>looks like there's</i>
<i>some fresh tire tracks.</i>

881
01:17:33,622 --> 01:17:34,688
<i>We're going to check it out.</i>

882
01:17:40,261 --> 01:17:41,428
<i>Come in, Otis?</i>

883
01:17:42,429 --> 01:17:43,797
Go for Otis.

884
01:17:43,931 --> 01:17:45,299
<i>A unit found</i>
<i>fresh tire tracks</i>

885
01:17:45,432 --> 01:17:46,867
<i>and a broken gate</i>
<i>near Brookers Lake.</i>

886
01:17:47,001 --> 01:17:48,202
<i>They're heading in</i>
<i>to investigate.</i>

887
01:17:48,335 --> 01:17:49,837
Send me the location.
I'm on my way.

888
01:17:51,172 --> 01:17:52,940
I just need to take
a little break.

889
01:17:53,908 --> 01:17:55,743
She's still here,
I can feel her.

890
01:18:02,517 --> 01:18:06,220
Jordan! Jordan! Jordan!

891
01:18:25,706 --> 01:18:26,675
Is she?

892
01:18:26,807 --> 01:18:27,708
Jordan, Jordan, baby, wake up.

893
01:18:27,841 --> 01:18:29,343
Jordan.

894
01:18:29,743 --> 01:18:32,012
She's alive, but she's weak.

895
01:18:32,146 --> 01:18:34,448
This thing must have known
that she was dying.

896
01:18:34,583 --> 01:18:35,716
It's been aggressive.

897
01:18:35,849 --> 01:18:37,017
Oh my god, we got to get
her out of here.

898
01:18:39,621 --> 01:18:40,788
Hey!

899
01:18:41,255 --> 01:18:43,692
No, no, shh! She doesn't
have much time.

900
01:18:43,824 --> 01:18:46,160
Okay, I need to do this here.

901
01:18:46,293 --> 01:18:47,294
Do what?

902
01:18:47,428 --> 01:18:48,630
You remember when
I said to trust me?

903
01:18:48,762 --> 01:18:50,030
-Yeah.
-Okay, now is that time.

904
01:18:50,164 --> 01:18:51,566
The police cannot find us.

905
01:18:51,700 --> 01:18:54,501
Okay? I need you to go, and
get them away from here.

906
01:18:54,636 --> 01:18:58,005
-Away?
-Yes, I don't know what they'll
do if they find her like this,

907
01:18:58,138 --> 01:19:01,909
but if they separate us,
I can't help her.

908
01:19:03,310 --> 01:19:04,278
Please.

909
01:19:04,745 --> 01:19:05,714
Okay, yeah.

910
01:19:05,846 --> 01:19:07,181
Okay, go.

911
01:19:09,450 --> 01:19:15,022
Hey! You, over, over here!
We're over here!

912
01:19:15,557 --> 01:19:17,559
Over here! Help!

913
01:19:17,692 --> 01:19:19,326
This way!

914
01:19:19,927 --> 01:19:21,462
Over here!

915
01:19:21,996 --> 01:19:24,231
Baby, baby, wake up.

916
01:19:24,365 --> 01:19:25,432
Mom?

917
01:19:25,567 --> 01:19:27,968
I'm here, I'm here.
Just stay with me, okay?

918
01:19:28,603 --> 01:19:30,404
Okay. I'm coming.

919
01:20:06,940 --> 01:20:08,777
No, you stay here.

920
01:20:22,923 --> 01:20:24,858
Oh, oh!

921
01:20:25,025 --> 01:20:26,393
Just a second.

922
01:20:26,860 --> 01:20:27,796
Oh, hey, guys.

923
01:20:27,928 --> 01:20:28,797
Where is she?

924
01:20:28,929 --> 01:20:30,264
Oh, yeah, I don't know.

925
01:20:30,397 --> 01:20:31,999
I was just kind of hoping
she was out this way.

926
01:20:32,132 --> 01:20:33,434
Go back to the car, see
if you can find tracks.

927
01:20:33,568 --> 01:20:35,603
Oh, no, no, no. She's,
she's not that way.

928
01:20:35,737 --> 01:20:36,837
She's not that way.

929
01:20:36,970 --> 01:20:37,905
Come on, let's go.

930
01:20:38,038 --> 01:20:38,906
Okay.

931
01:21:53,347 --> 01:21:54,616
Where is she?

932
01:21:54,749 --> 01:21:55,750
She sent us in circles.

933
01:21:55,884 --> 01:21:57,184
Oh, please. He's exaggerating.

934
01:21:57,317 --> 01:21:59,219
What are you not telling us?

935
01:21:59,987 --> 01:22:01,556
Well, there is this one thing.

936
01:22:03,056 --> 01:22:06,126
In grade 11, I tried acid.

937
01:22:06,293 --> 01:22:07,629
Horrible, horrible.

938
01:22:07,762 --> 01:22:09,029
Put her in the back.

939
01:22:09,163 --> 01:22:11,533
Wait! Do you want to know
who sold it to me?

940
01:22:12,065 --> 01:22:13,735
It was my uncle!

941
01:22:56,076 --> 01:22:57,344
Mom.

942
01:23:37,585 --> 01:23:39,353
Leave her alone.

943
01:23:40,855 --> 01:23:41,956
Take me.

944
01:23:47,127 --> 01:23:50,565
Feed me.

945
01:25:15,583 --> 01:25:17,018
Ah!

946
01:26:30,858 --> 01:26:32,325
Where are you?!

947
01:27:29,650 --> 01:27:33,286
Feed me.

948
01:27:33,420 --> 01:27:35,489
You're hungry. We get it.

949
01:27:49,436 --> 01:27:54,642
Feed me.

950
01:28:42,455 --> 01:28:44,324
I'm sorry, Dad.

951
01:29:10,084 --> 01:29:11,552
Cynthia.

952
01:29:14,322 --> 01:29:16,090
Cynthia, wake up.

953
01:29:18,593 --> 01:29:20,393
<i>Cynthia, wake up.</i>

954
01:29:20,528 --> 01:29:22,864
No, Otis, not now.

955
01:30:00,400 --> 01:30:01,335
Ah!

956
01:30:06,941 --> 01:30:07,875
No!

957
01:30:12,947 --> 01:30:14,081
Cynthia!

958
01:30:16,483 --> 01:30:18,352
Just keep looking.

959
01:30:19,186 --> 01:30:21,956
Whatever you're doing,
hurry it up.

960
01:30:28,596 --> 01:30:31,999
Mom? Mom, wake up.

961
01:30:39,273 --> 01:30:40,473
Why didn't that work?

962
01:30:58,092 --> 01:30:59,660
Please. Please.

963
01:30:59,794 --> 01:31:02,730
Take me, and leave her alone.

964
01:31:10,571 --> 01:31:13,473
Just leave her alone.

965
01:31:21,415 --> 01:31:22,650
Hey.

966
01:31:23,451 --> 01:31:24,452
Feed on this.

967
01:31:42,636 --> 01:31:43,404
Jordan!

968
01:31:46,207 --> 01:31:47,475
Come here, we have
to kill it.

969
01:31:50,077 --> 01:31:53,814
We can't leave. We have
to kill it here, now.

970
01:31:53,948 --> 01:31:55,249
Hurry. Grab something.

971
01:32:27,314 --> 01:32:28,616
Jordan!

972
01:32:29,717 --> 01:32:32,486
Jordan, baby. Baby?

973
01:32:33,421 --> 01:32:34,088
Okay, it's okay.

974
01:32:36,323 --> 01:32:39,060
It's okay, it's okay,
it's over, it's over.

975
01:32:40,828 --> 01:32:43,597
Okay, oh, baby.

976
01:32:44,598 --> 01:32:46,000
It's okay.

977
01:32:46,300 --> 01:32:47,902
-Mom!
-Okay.

978
01:32:49,070 --> 01:32:49,804
Okay.

979
01:32:49,937 --> 01:32:52,406
I saw him, Mom, I saw him.

980
01:32:52,541 --> 01:32:54,642
I know, baby. I know.

981
01:32:54,775 --> 01:32:56,177
I saw dad.

982
01:32:59,814 --> 01:33:03,184
It's okay. It's over,
it's over, baby.

983
01:33:03,317 --> 01:33:06,854
It's okay. You're okay.
You're okay.

984
01:33:08,422 --> 01:33:09,723
It's over.

985
01:33:10,091 --> 01:33:11,292
It's over.

986
01:33:23,204 --> 01:33:24,405
Over here!

987
01:33:24,905 --> 01:33:27,641
We found her! Get EMS here now!

988
01:33:27,775 --> 01:33:30,144
Call it in!
Get EMS here.

989
01:33:31,278 --> 01:33:32,113
Thank you.

990
01:33:34,815 --> 01:33:38,853
Oh, baby. Baby, it's okay.

991
01:33:38,986 --> 01:33:41,556
Thank you. Thank you, Mom.

992
01:33:43,290 --> 01:33:46,060
Hey, hey, get the shovels.
We need to clear this out.

993
01:33:50,197 --> 01:33:52,099
<i>Found her,</i>
<i>send EMS.</i>

994
01:33:52,233 --> 01:33:53,300
<i>She's alive.</i>

995
01:34:06,914 --> 01:34:09,150
You're okay, baby. It's okay.

996
01:34:50,124 --> 01:34:52,092
How are you feeling today?

997
01:34:54,395 --> 01:34:55,396
Okay.

998
01:35:26,961 --> 01:35:29,330
Only if you're ready, okay?

999
01:37:18,972 --> 01:37:22,242
I am so proud of you.

1000
01:37:23,844 --> 01:37:25,112
Now you do me.

1001
01:37:25,245 --> 01:37:28,349
No, no way
I'm ready for that.

1002
01:37:38,425 --> 01:37:39,960
I'm so proud.

1003
01:37:42,129 --> 01:37:44,264
Your father would be so proud.
