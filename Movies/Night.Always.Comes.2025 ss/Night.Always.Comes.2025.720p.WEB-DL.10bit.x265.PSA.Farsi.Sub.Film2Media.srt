<i>Over here!</i>

3
00:00:19,125 --> 00:00:20,708
<i>Guess what?</i>

4
00:00:28,250 --> 00:00:29,208
I'm not!

5
00:00:29,291 --> 00:00:30,875
Stop!

6
00:00:32,125 --> 00:00:33,791
What's wrong, sweetie?

7
00:00:35,333 --> 00:00:37,958
Mama! I got mud on my knee!

8
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:50,708
Now it's a house!

17
00:01:44,916 --> 00:01:48,375
<i>Numbers released by the Fed today

18
00:01:48,458 --> 00:01:50,333
<i>rising rents, and an
ever-concerning...</i>

19
00:01:50,416 --> 00:01:52,166
Ken. Come on.

20
00:01:52,833 --> 00:01:54,958
It's a big day. We're closing
on the house, remember?

21
00:01:55,041 --> 00:01:57,500
-One more minute.
-Get up. You say that every morning.

22
00:01:57,583 --> 00:02:00,833
<i>One University of Washington
economist put it this way...</i>

23
00:02:00,916 --> 00:02:02,000
Mom, get up.

24
00:02:02,083 --> 00:02:04,625
<i>...fundamentals of the
American economy are breaking,</i>

25
00:02:04,708 --> 00:02:07,000
<i>especially in the job market
and the housing market.</i>

26
00:02:07,083 --> 00:02:10,167
<i>People are actually being paid less
than they used to for the same jobs.</i>

27
00:02:10,250 --> 00:02:13,125
<i>Middle wages are going
down thanks to inflation.</i>

28

<i>A hundred dollars used to
get you a lot of groceries.</i>

29
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:18,667
<i>Now you're spending twice that and
your bags are less full than before.</i>

30
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:21,375
<i>Economists believe it's
not just food prices.</i>

31
00:02:21,458 --> 00:02:22,917
<i>According to new numbers,</i>

32
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,208
<i>the majority of all renters spend over
a third of their income on housing.</i>

<i>The consequences could be
disastrous, including eviction rates,</i>

35
00:02:37,041 --> 00:02:39,625
<i>job losses, and mental
health difficulties.</i>

36
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,291
Don't look at me like that.

37
00:02:50,083 --> 00:02:51,208
Ugh...

38
00:02:51,291 --> 00:02:54,417
Who can sleep with your
horse feet clomping around?

39
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:57,583
Don't sleep out there and then
you won't have to hear me.

40
00:02:57,666 --> 00:02:59,125
Don't be an asshole.

41
00:02:59,208 --> 00:03:02,167
It's too early to deal with
your constant criticisms.

42
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:05,167
We're meeting David at the attorney's
at 2:30 to sign the papers.

43

So you can't be
late. Do you hear me?

44
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:10,917
Yeah, okay. You don't need to
remind me every two minutes, okay?

45
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
If we don't put the money
down today, we'll be evicted.

46
00:03:14,875 --> 00:03:16,250
Do you understand?

47
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:18,542
-Mom? Do you understand?
-Hey, Mommy.

48
00:03:18,625 --> 00:03:19,625
Hi, babe.

49
00:03:20,541 --> 00:03:21,666
Come here.

50
00:03:22,375 --> 00:03:23,958
Mm. How did you sleep?

51
00:03:24,041 --> 00:03:25,458
-Really good.
-I like that.

52
00:03:25,541 --> 00:03:27,541
-Ken, where's your other shoe?
-What?

53
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:33,375
So you gotta pick up the check
from Chase on the way, right?

54
00:03:33,458 --> 00:03:36,500
-Of course, I got it. Thank you.
-Okay. 2:30.

55
00:03:36,583 --> 00:03:37,666
Come on, Ken.

56
00:03:53,708 --> 00:03:56,250
<i>Coming up here on

57

<i>Everything's going up

61
00:04:05,583 --> 00:04:09,083
<i>-Latest numbers from the Fed confirmed...</i>
-Are you excited for the house?

62
00:04:09,166 --> 00:04:10,500
-Oh, yes.
-Oh, yes.

63
00:04:10,583 --> 00:04:12,708
Uh, great times.

64
00:04:12,791 --> 00:04:15,208
You know what it means to
own a home, don't you, Ken?

65
00:04:15,291 --> 00:04:17,750
It means Social Services
can't take you away again.

66
00:04:17,833 --> 00:04:21,958
Yeah. And I can
paint my bedroom red.

67
00:04:22,041 --> 00:04:25,208
<i>If you're homeless,
or live in a motel,</i>

68
00:04:25,291 --> 00:04:28,833
<i>or are even just struggling,
everyone assumes that you deserve it.</i>

69
00:04:28,916 --> 00:04:30,917
<i>It just takes one raise in rent,</i>

70
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,416
<i>one missed shift at work, and
anyone could be right here.</i>

71
00:04:35,041 --> 00:04:36,542
<i>Everyone thinks,</i>

72
00:04:36,625 --> 00:04:39,625
<i>"They're homeless because of
something they've done." Well, no.</i>

73
00:04:39,708 --> 00:04:43,083
<i>Sometimes it's just like one slip-up,
one big bill coming in, and boom,</i>

74
00:04:43,166 --> 00:04:46,542
<i>you're evicted, you're living in
your car, and there's no way back.</i>

75
00:04:46,625 --> 00:04:50,042
<i>It's rare, but it's not. For
every one person who finds a home,</i>

76
00:04:50,125 --> 00:04:54,042
<i>four more are forced out of
theirs. Think about that.</i>

77
00:04:54,125 --> 00:04:57,458
<i>And if you have an eviction on
your record, nobody'll rent to you.</i>

78
00:04:57,541 --> 00:05:01,208
<i>I think Americans are trained
from birth to hate poor people.</i>

79
00:05:01,958 --> 00:05:05,791
<i>Even poor people hate poor people.
That's the DNA of this country.</i>

80
00:05:06,541 --> 00:05:09,167
<i>We have wages falling,
prices going up,</i>

81
00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:11,125
<i>housing completely
out of control.</i>

82
00:05:11,208 --> 00:05:13,458
<i>It really feels to me
and to a lot of others</i>

83
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:17,500
<i>that the fundamentals of American
society are just breaking down,</i>

84
00:05:17,583 --> 00:05:20,250
<i>especially when it comes
to jobs and housing.</i>

85
00:05:20,333 --> 00:05:23,167
<i>"Working homeless"
ought to be an oxymoron.</i>

86
00:05:23,250 --> 00:05:27,667
<i>And here I am living in my car, and
showering at the YMCA, and just...</i>

87
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:29,792
You're gonna be okay
while I'm at work?

88
00:05:29,875 --> 00:05:33,583
Will you ask about
the job at the bakery?

89
00:05:33,666 --> 00:05:35,250
Yeah. I'm gonna ask him again.

90
00:05:35,333 --> 00:05:38,958
<i>I'm with you. For the rich,
Portland is this huge success story.</i>

91
00:05:39,041 --> 00:05:42,417
<i>Rents are skyrocketing,
investments, luxury developments...</i>

92
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:44,333
<i>Life's great for
property owners...</i>

93
00:06:17,416 --> 00:06:19,458
Ah, it's a big day for you, huh?

94
00:06:19,541 --> 00:06:21,958
Yeah. Though until it's
signed, I'm like, ugh.

95
00:06:22,041 --> 00:06:24,625
-Just can't even...
-Mama doing all right?

96
00:06:24,708 --> 00:06:28,042
Yeah, you know. She's a total
fucking mess like always.

97
00:06:28,125 --> 00:06:29,125
Mm.

98
00:06:29,208 --> 00:06:31,708
All right. Hit it.

99
00:06:53,666 --> 00:06:56,583
The manager's here, Ken.
Come on, you gotta go.

100
00:06:56,666 --> 00:06:58,875
Did you ask about the job?

101
00:06:58,958 --> 00:07:01,167
Yeah, I... I did. There's
nothing right now.

102
00:07:05,791 --> 00:07:07,375
Syrup on the side this time?

103
00:07:07,458 --> 00:07:09,250
-Uh, no, top.
-No, side.

104
00:07:09,333 --> 00:07:11,958
-No, top.
-Yesterday you said side.

105
00:07:12,041 --> 00:07:15,042
-No, I did not say that.
-You can't change your mind all the time.

106
00:07:15,125 --> 00:07:16,875
-Five dollars.
-I don't care.

107
00:07:16,958 --> 00:07:18,583
-"Thank you."
-Yeah, give me.

108
00:07:22,458 --> 00:07:23,708
Morning, Kenny.

109
00:07:26,333 --> 00:07:28,625
-Ken, I'll be done in three.
-Okay.

110
00:07:49,875 --> 00:07:51,625
In the end...

111
00:07:51,708 --> 00:07:55,917
the differences between Monetarist and
the Keynesian approaches are just...

112
00:07:58,166 --> 00:08:01,708
...differences in opinion on
how to maximize economic growth.

113
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:04,625
She looks like Hillary Clinton.

114
00:08:04,708 --> 00:08:07,875
The driving force here is...

115
00:08:09,791 --> 00:08:12,750
-He needs full-time care.
-Yeah, I know. That's under control.

116
00:08:12,833 --> 00:08:16,083
-There are facilities for that.
-We're just in between facilities.

117
00:08:16,166 --> 00:08:18,083
Find one. My
classroom is not it.

118
00:08:18,166 --> 00:08:20,167
-Yeah, I get it.
-Um, my name's Kenny.

119
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:23,541
-Okay, but Kenny can't be here.
-Yup, we know that.

120
00:08:24,125 --> 00:08:26,375
-You know I was bullshitting her, right?
-Yeah.

121
00:08:26,458 --> 00:08:29,333
-You're not going back to that place.
-I'm not going back.

122
00:08:29,416 --> 00:08:30,666
-Never.
-No.

123
00:08:31,625 --> 00:08:34,541
-We're getting a house now, Ken.
-Cool.

124
00:08:52,583 --> 00:08:53,833
Do I look okay?

125
00:08:54,333 --> 00:08:56,541
-You look good.
-You think?

126
00:08:57,083 --> 00:08:58,416
Mama better be here.

127
00:08:59,583 --> 00:09:01,291
Why do I feel so nervous?

128
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,583
I... want you...

129
00:09:06,666 --> 00:09:09,542
I want you to be,
you know, strong.

130
00:09:09,625 --> 00:09:12,083
Strong and just be yourself,

131
00:09:12,166 --> 00:09:14,708
and just be adorable.

132
00:09:15,208 --> 00:09:17,375
There's this... Here she is.

133
00:09:19,958 --> 00:09:23,458
Hi, David. I'm so sorry. We got
held up in traffic. It was...

134
00:09:23,541 --> 00:09:26,250
-It's fine.
-Yeah, um...

135
00:09:26,333 --> 00:09:29,208
-Oh, this is Kenny, you remember?
-Of course.

136
00:09:29,291 --> 00:09:30,666
-Hey.
-Hey.

137
00:09:31,458 --> 00:09:33,333
Uh, this is Mike
Gregory, my lawyer.

138
00:09:33,416 --> 00:09:34,791
-Hi.
-Hi.

139
00:09:35,625 --> 00:09:36,625
Hello, Mike.

140
00:09:38,666 --> 00:09:42,000
Uh, thank you for the money off
and the extension that you gave me.

141
00:09:42,083 --> 00:09:44,875
Of course! My dad would've
wanted you to have it, so...

142
00:09:44,958 --> 00:09:46,667
Doreen's not with you?

143
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:49,333
We need both of you
to sign the loan.

144
00:09:50,125 --> 00:09:53,083
Uh, of course. I mean, she
texted me to say, um...

145
00:09:53,166 --> 00:09:56,583
Uh, she should be here.
It's probably minutes away.

146
00:09:56,666 --> 00:10:00,208
Um, thing is we don't have a lot of time.
I have to go see a property in St. John's.

147
00:10:00,291 --> 00:10:02,750
No, she's coming. She's
coming. I'll call her.

148
00:10:02,833 --> 00:10:05,292
Uh, sure.

149
00:10:08,666 --> 00:10:12,250
Stressful. I guess I don't
know what I expected.

150
00:10:12,333 --> 00:10:15,667
Um, okay, I feel like
we've tried and tried here.

151
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:18,083
It's just...

152
00:10:18,166 --> 00:10:20,125
-<i>Hi, listen...</i>
-Where are you?

153
00:10:20,208 --> 00:10:22,833
<i>I'm... I got, like,
held up. Where are you?</i>

154
00:10:22,916 --> 00:10:24,667
I'm at the attorney's office.

155
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:28,041
<i>Uh, well, you're gonna have
to tell them I can't make it.</i>

156
00:10:28,583 --> 00:10:31,542
<i>I... I can't talk about
this right now. Sorry.</i>

157
00:10:31,625 --> 00:10:32,833
Are you serious?

158
00:10:32,916 --> 00:10:34,667
<i>Mm, gotta... gotta go.</i>

159
00:10:37,833 --> 00:10:40,500
Is, uh... Is Doreen
gonna make it?

160
00:10:54,416 --> 00:10:56,292
<i>It's Doreen. You
know what to do.</i>

161
00:10:56,375 --> 00:10:58,417
<i>...Sharon Wright
from Cash Express...</i>

162
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:00,625
<i>It's Doreen. You
know what to do.</i>

163
00:11:03,458 --> 00:11:06,458
<i>Denise called in sick, so I'm
covering until you arrive.</i>

164
00:11:06,541 --> 00:11:07,750
<i>Try not to be late...</i>

165
00:11:15,083 --> 00:11:17,833
Oh no. We're so fucked.

166
00:11:45,625 --> 00:11:46,708
What is that?

167
00:11:47,375 --> 00:11:48,500
It's a car.

168
00:11:49,625 --> 00:11:50,792
Whose car?

169
00:11:50,875 --> 00:11:52,917
Mine. Bought it.

170
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,917
Passed that dealer on the way to work.
They were having this Mazda Madness sale.

171
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,708
-You're not serious.
-I saw this beautiful white car.

172
00:12:00,333 --> 00:12:03,416
So I went in, I hustled
them, and I got a great deal.

173
00:12:05,833 --> 00:12:08,625
So instead of coming to the
attorney's office like we planned,

174
00:12:08,708 --> 00:12:11,916
you left work, went to a car
dealership, and you bought a car?

175
00:12:12,791 --> 00:12:14,000
Yeah, pretty much.

176
00:12:15,958 --> 00:12:17,625
How much was that?

177
00:12:17,708 --> 00:12:21,333
Um, I put 25 down, so my
monthly is almost nothing.

178
00:12:21,416 --> 00:12:22,625
$25,000?

179
00:12:23,583 --> 00:12:24,583
It's my money, right?

180
00:12:24,666 --> 00:12:27,000
You just spent our whole
down payment on a car?

181
00:12:27,083 --> 00:12:29,541
Well, I'm allowed to
spend my own money.

182
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:34,000
-Working at Fred Meyer till I drop dead.
-Do you have any idea what this means?

183
00:12:34,083 --> 00:12:39,208
I've been saving for years, so I thought,
why not do something nice for myself once?

184
00:12:39,291 --> 00:12:41,625
Why would you do this today?
That money is for the house.

185
00:12:41,708 --> 00:12:44,208
I'm gonna go inside,
I'm gonna grab a Coke,

186
00:12:44,291 --> 00:12:46,792
and then I'm gonna grab Kenny
and take him for a drive.

187
00:12:46,875 --> 00:12:49,750
You didn't turn up because
you were at Mazda Mania?

188
00:12:49,833 --> 00:12:51,167
-Really?
-It's Mazda Madness.

189
00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:53,750
Mazda Madness, then?
We're gonna be evicted.

190
00:12:53,833 --> 00:12:55,167
Do you understand that?

191
00:12:55,250 --> 00:12:58,625
I mean, have you actually lost your
mind? We don't have anywhere to go.

192
00:12:58,708 --> 00:13:01,333
We're gonna be out on the
streets. What do you not get?

193
00:13:01,416 --> 00:13:03,500
I'm really sorry. It was
a shitty thing to do.

194
00:13:03,583 --> 00:13:05,583
And I'm... I'm a
really shitty mom.

195
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:09,125
I know you're upset, and
that's the last thing I want,

196
00:13:09,208 --> 00:13:12,417
but honestly, I didn't tell you
because I knew you'd be upset, and...

197
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:15,917
"Upset"? I just had to beg David
to give us till tomorrow...

198
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,375
David's a crook.

199
00:13:18,125 --> 00:13:21,000
His loan is a shitty loan, and
the house is shittier still.

200
00:13:21,083 --> 00:13:22,958
Everything's falling apart here.

201
00:13:23,041 --> 00:13:25,625
Oh God. They're gonna
take Kenny away.

202
00:13:25,708 --> 00:13:27,667
-I knew you'd act like this.
-Fuck, fuck.

203
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:30,708
Okay, listen to me, okay? I
told you I'm gonna do it up.

204
00:13:30,791 --> 00:13:33,125
I told you I'm gonna fix
it up. Gonna make it nice.

205
00:13:33,208 --> 00:13:35,375
Gonna make it so nice.
Because that's the point.

206
00:13:35,458 --> 00:13:37,500
We'll never get another
opportunity like this.

207
00:13:37,583 --> 00:13:39,750
This is our only
chance. Do you get that?

208
00:13:39,833 --> 00:13:42,417
There's another offer. He's
gonna take the offer tomorrow.

209
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:44,125
-Do you understand that?
-I cannot.

210
00:13:44,208 --> 00:13:46,917
-They'll take Kenny away.
-I'm not doing this with you now.

211
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:50,042
-Please just give me the keys.
-No. I'm not giving you the keys.

212
00:13:50,125 --> 00:13:52,417
I am not having this
conversation right now!

213
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:53,500
Stop fighting!

214
00:13:53,583 --> 00:13:56,167
I'm gonna take it back. I'm
gonna do all of the talking.

215
00:13:56,250 --> 00:13:59,500
-I'm gonna tell them you made a mistake.
-But I haven't made a mistake.

216
00:13:59,583 --> 00:14:02,750
You have. You have. Just give me
the keys. Just give me the keys.

217
00:14:02,833 --> 00:14:04,458
-Give me the fucking keys!
-Hey!

218
00:14:04,541 --> 00:14:06,417
-Give me the fucking...
-Stop fighting.

219
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:08,583
I hate when you fight!

220
00:14:11,125 --> 00:14:12,667
Hey, babe?

221
00:14:12,750 --> 00:14:15,916
Would you like to go for a
ride in my brand-new car?

222
00:14:16,750 --> 00:14:18,583
-Oh God.
-So cool, Mom.

223
00:14:21,083 --> 00:14:22,500
Okay. Okay.

224
00:14:22,583 --> 00:14:25,167
But this... Mom,
this is about Kenny.

225
00:14:25,250 --> 00:14:26,375
This is so cool.

226
00:14:26,458 --> 00:14:28,750
Come on. We'll go to
Dairy Queen and celebrate.

227
00:14:28,833 --> 00:14:32,042
We'll be homeless, and you'll be
living in that fucking Mazda, Mom.

228
00:14:32,125 --> 00:14:35,125
-You wanna buy the house?
-Kenny will go back in that care home.

229
00:14:35,208 --> 00:14:36,958
Get it on your
own. God love you.

230
00:14:37,041 --> 00:14:40,208
-You go for it, okay?
-You know I can't get a loan on my own.

231
00:14:40,291 --> 00:14:42,583
-You know that!
-Yeah, and whose fault is that?

232
00:14:42,666 --> 00:14:45,292
And I'm gonna be out on the street
again. Is that what you want?

233
00:14:45,375 --> 00:14:48,875
How long have you kept a job before you
blow it and you freak out at everybody

234
00:14:48,958 --> 00:14:51,125
and start threatening
people and throwing shit?

235
00:14:51,208 --> 00:14:53,375
I'm sorry. No, come
on. I'm begging you.

236
00:14:53,458 --> 00:14:54,917
Please. Do not do this.

237
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:58,125
I'm begging you. Please.
Let's just take it back, okay?

238
00:14:58,208 --> 00:15:00,625
I will go to the
dealership, tell them...

239
00:15:00,708 --> 00:15:02,416
Can you not? Fuck off.

240
00:15:03,250 --> 00:15:06,083
It's done. It's signed.
That's the contract, okay?

241
00:15:06,166 --> 00:15:08,625
It's over, it's done.
Let go. It's over.

242
00:15:10,375 --> 00:15:11,875
Oh God. Fuck.

243
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:14,000
Okay, you know what?

244
00:15:15,708 --> 00:15:17,708
I'm gonna get the $25,000.

245
00:15:17,791 --> 00:15:19,750
You are insane, and you
have lost your mind.

246
00:15:19,833 --> 00:15:22,125
You've lost your mind.
Kenny, she's lost her mind.

247
00:15:22,208 --> 00:15:26,208
Okay, just don't forget to pick
Kenny up tonight from Mona's, okay?

248
00:15:39,125 --> 00:15:42,042
<i>This is David Claremont
from Portland Real Estate.</i>

249
00:15:42,125 --> 00:15:44,458
<i>Leave a message and
I'll call you back.</i>

250
00:15:44,541 --> 00:15:47,500
David, hi, it's Lynette.
Um, I'm sorry about today.

251
00:15:47,583 --> 00:15:49,958
I just, um, I have something
I wanted to talk to you about.

252
00:15:50,041 --> 00:15:52,958
It's kind of urgent. Would you
mind just giving me a call back?

253
00:15:53,041 --> 00:15:53,875
Thanks.

254
00:15:58,875 --> 00:16:00,000
You okay?

255
00:16:03,625 --> 00:16:06,500
-You're late again! It's 6:30.
-I know, Tammy.

256
00:16:07,583 --> 00:16:09,792
-I know. Sorry, I got caught up...
-Whatever.

257
00:16:09,875 --> 00:16:14,000
I just wish you wouldn't be such a
slacker and be on time once in a while.

258
00:16:14,083 --> 00:16:16,792
-Something happened.
-Not my problem.

259
00:16:16,875 --> 00:16:19,250
-Can you grab that food order there, sis?
-Yeah.

260
00:16:19,333 --> 00:16:21,125
-Hi, David.
<i>-Are you backing out?</i>

261
00:16:21,208 --> 00:16:26,125
No, it's just that the bank is fucked
up and they didn't get the check in time

262
00:16:26,208 --> 00:16:29,708
and we might just need a bit more
time because it's a weekend tomorrow.

263
00:16:29,791 --> 00:16:32,667
<i>Okay, enough already. I've
been more than generous.</i>

264
00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:35,292
I know. If you could just...
I know that you have, David.

265
00:16:35,375 --> 00:16:38,750
You know that I know that you have. I
just need a bit more time, that's all.

266
00:16:38,833 --> 00:16:40,542
-I just need one more day.
<i>-Lynette, stop!</i>

267
00:16:40,625 --> 00:16:42,000
<i>9:00 a.m. tomorrow morning.</i>

268
00:16:42,083 --> 00:16:45,167
<i>If all the money is in my account,
we have a deal. Otherwise, it's off.</i>

269
00:16:45,250 --> 00:16:47,375
<i>-$25,000 by 9:00 a.m.</i>
-Okay.

270
00:16:47,458 --> 00:16:49,791
<i>-Last chance, Lynette.</i>
-Yeah. Tomorrow.

271
00:16:54,916 --> 00:16:56,791
Fuck.

272
00:16:57,791 --> 00:17:00,042
-You okay?
-Yeah.

273
00:17:00,125 --> 00:17:01,125
No.

274
00:17:01,208 --> 00:17:02,291
Can I have one?

275
00:17:11,041 --> 00:17:12,708
-Cody.
-I know.

276
00:17:19,333 --> 00:17:21,167
-Scott, hi.
<i>-You called?</i>

277
00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:23,000
-Yes.
<i>-You free to meet?</i>

278
00:17:23,083 --> 00:17:25,167
Yes, I can, actually.

279
00:17:25,250 --> 00:17:26,625
I'm free, that's right.

280
00:17:26,708 --> 00:17:28,292
<i>The usual place, okay?</i>

281
00:17:28,375 --> 00:17:30,875
Yes, that's great. We
can definitely do that.

282
00:17:31,583 --> 00:17:32,708
-Fifteen minutes?
<i>-Thirty.</i>

283
00:17:32,791 --> 00:17:33,833
Sure.

284
00:18:13,791 --> 00:18:15,708
Right over there.
Help yourself.

285
00:18:15,791 --> 00:18:17,917
-Where are you going, girl?
-I've gotta...

286
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,583
-No way. No.
-It's Kenny. I've gotta go.

287
00:18:20,666 --> 00:18:22,458
-I'm so sorry.
-It's always Kenny!

288
00:19:28,958 --> 00:19:29,958
-Hi.
-Hey.

289
00:19:30,458 --> 00:19:31,458
Hi.

290
00:19:33,333 --> 00:19:35,333
-Never seen you not dressed up.
-I know.

291
00:19:35,416 --> 00:19:37,875
I thought I'd mix
it up a little bit.

292
00:19:38,375 --> 00:19:39,916
It looks, um, good.

293
00:19:40,583 --> 00:19:43,000
I was surprised you called.
You never called me before.

294
00:19:43,083 --> 00:19:45,625
-No, I know. I never do.
-It was actually good timing.

295
00:19:45,708 --> 00:19:47,083
I had the evening free.

296
00:19:47,166 --> 00:19:49,042
That's great. I'm so pleased.

297
00:19:49,125 --> 00:19:50,250
So why'd you call?

298
00:19:50,750 --> 00:19:53,167
Well, I, um...

299
00:19:53,250 --> 00:19:57,250
-I had this idea for us I'd like to share.
-Idea? Okay.

300
00:19:57,333 --> 00:19:59,666
Is it a sexy idea?

301
00:20:00,166 --> 00:20:03,292
-So, okay. So, you know...
-You know what? Let me get you a drink.

302
00:20:03,375 --> 00:20:05,417
-Excuse me!
-Yes, hi.

303
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:08,042
-Two tequila on the rocks, please.
-Sure.

304
00:20:08,125 --> 00:20:11,375
-Idea.
-Yes, an amazing investment opportunity.

305
00:20:11,458 --> 00:20:13,625
I live in Kenton.
You know that area?

306
00:20:13,708 --> 00:20:16,292
-From the news sometimes, yes.
-Yeah.

307
00:20:16,375 --> 00:20:18,333
Yeah, I know,
right? It's so...

308
00:20:18,416 --> 00:20:19,792
I live in a place there,

309
00:20:19,875 --> 00:20:23,583
and the guys decided to sell it to us
for $40,000 under the asking price,

310
00:20:23,666 --> 00:20:25,042
which I thought was a good...

311
00:20:25,125 --> 00:20:26,708
-It's a really good deal.
-Okay.

312
00:20:26,791 --> 00:20:29,000
-We got this one shot of getting us...
-Who's us?

313
00:20:30,833 --> 00:20:32,375
My mom and my brother.

314
00:20:33,625 --> 00:20:36,000
Oh, um... Yeah, you
should go for it.

315
00:20:36,083 --> 00:20:38,583
Yeah, the thing is, is that
we lost the deposit on the...

316
00:20:38,666 --> 00:20:40,417
Here you go. Two tequilas.

317
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:41,875
Thank you.

318
00:20:42,458 --> 00:20:44,083
<i>-Salud.
-Salud.</i>

319
00:20:44,166 --> 00:20:45,250
Yeah.

320
00:20:47,666 --> 00:20:49,583
All right, so the thing is what?

321
00:20:50,083 --> 00:20:54,625
Well, the thing is we had this deposit,
and it kind of went wrong today,

322
00:20:54,708 --> 00:20:57,125
and I just wondered
whether maybe, um...

323
00:20:57,791 --> 00:21:00,916
I wondered if you might be able
to, uh... lend me the money.

324
00:21:01,708 --> 00:21:03,833
The, uh, $25,000.

325
00:21:03,916 --> 00:21:06,000
For the house?

326
00:21:06,083 --> 00:21:07,792
Yeah, no, but
through your company,

327
00:21:07,875 --> 00:21:10,167
'cause I know you're really
good at this stuff, and...

328
00:21:10,250 --> 00:21:12,042
Wait, are you joking?

329
00:21:12,125 --> 00:21:13,500
You're joking, right?

330
00:21:13,583 --> 00:21:15,542
I wouldn't ask you
if it wasn't...

331
00:21:15,625 --> 00:21:17,541
I just really, I just...

332
00:21:19,041 --> 00:21:21,375
I just need a bit
of help right now.

333
00:21:22,416 --> 00:21:24,292
-Was wondering if...
-No.

334
00:21:24,375 --> 00:21:26,542
-If you could ask people at work.
-Yeah, no.

335
00:21:26,625 --> 00:21:28,542
Maybe there's a way
you can maybe...

336
00:21:28,625 --> 00:21:32,417
I'm not looking to find a way to
work out any deals with you, Lynette.

337
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:33,625
Sure. Yeah.

338
00:21:34,291 --> 00:21:35,917
Look, listen. Listen.

339
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,083
I like you.

340
00:21:37,583 --> 00:21:40,417
Okay? I do. We have a
lot of fun together.

341
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:46,041
But I don't want to know that you live
with your mother and your brother.

342
00:21:47,125 --> 00:21:48,125
You know?

343
00:21:48,625 --> 00:21:52,833
Like, I pay to have a good time,
not to talk about that stuff.

344
00:21:55,833 --> 00:21:56,833
Yeah?

345
00:21:57,458 --> 00:21:58,958
I have enough worries as it is.

346
00:21:59,041 --> 00:22:03,125
My kids always asking for stuff,
never saying "thank you" ever.

347
00:22:03,625 --> 00:22:04,542
-You know?
-Yeah.

348
00:22:11,208 --> 00:22:12,750
-You okay?
-Yes.

349
00:22:13,375 --> 00:22:15,167
-Yeah, I'm great. I'm really great.
-Yeah?

350
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:18,750
-Still okay to go up to the room?
-Yeah, yeah, yeah. Always.

351
00:22:19,333 --> 00:22:20,333
Okay.

352
00:23:22,458 --> 00:23:25,666
Here's, uh... the $500.

353
00:23:26,166 --> 00:23:29,000
And I'm going to double
it as a parting gift.

354
00:23:31,083 --> 00:23:33,208
It's been fun these
past few months.

355
00:23:33,708 --> 00:23:34,708
It really has.

356
00:23:36,708 --> 00:23:38,208
Good luck with the house.

357
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:21,625
Yes, honey. We'll talk about
it when I get home, okay?

358
00:24:21,708 --> 00:24:24,500
Say good night to the
kids. Okay. Love you.

359
00:25:00,916 --> 00:25:02,041
All right.

360
00:25:18,875 --> 00:25:19,916
Fuck.

361
00:25:26,875 --> 00:25:28,875
Shit.

362
00:25:54,166 --> 00:25:56,333
<i>Hey, Lynette, crazy question.</i>

363
00:25:56,416 --> 00:25:58,416
<i>Did you see my key
fob in the room?</i>

364
00:26:15,916 --> 00:26:17,708
What the fuck am I doing?

365
00:26:52,416 --> 00:26:53,541
Shit.

366
00:26:58,041 --> 00:26:59,083
Fuck.

367
00:27:01,375 --> 00:27:04,042
<i>I know you've taken
my car, Lynette.</i>

368
00:27:04,125 --> 00:27:07,375
<i>Call me right fucking
now! I mean it!</i>

369
00:27:07,458 --> 00:27:09,541
<i>Call me back!</i>

370
00:27:38,458 --> 00:27:39,708
-Hi.
-Lyn-Lyn!

371
00:27:39,791 --> 00:27:42,250
What are you doing here?

372
00:27:42,333 --> 00:27:43,458
-I missed you.
-Hi.

373
00:27:43,541 --> 00:27:46,417
What's going on? I thought
you were the delivery guy.

374
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:48,750
Oh! All right. Come on
in. Make yourself at home.

375
00:27:48,833 --> 00:27:49,958
Oh my God.

376
00:27:50,041 --> 00:27:53,208
This better be good. My Lyft's
gonna be here in five minutes.

377
00:27:53,708 --> 00:27:57,125
-Is this where he's got you now?
-It's Robert's old bachelor pad.

378
00:27:57,208 --> 00:28:00,833
You know, I'm making it my own,
and... I mean, look at this view.

379
00:28:00,916 --> 00:28:03,625
Didn't have this at the last
place. Do you want a drink?

380
00:28:03,708 --> 00:28:05,250
There's a whole
bunch right there.

381
00:28:05,333 --> 00:28:07,083
-Yeah.
-Make me one too.

382
00:28:07,625 --> 00:28:10,417
To what do I owe this
pleasant surprise?

383
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:12,833
I need to ask you something.

384
00:28:12,916 --> 00:28:15,333
Ah-ah-ah-ah! No, no, no!
Don't touch those glasses.

385
00:28:15,416 --> 00:28:17,417
They're Robert's. If you
break it, he'll kill me.

386
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:19,208
There's clean ones
above the sink.

387
00:28:19,291 --> 00:28:21,667
Anyway, I wish I could stay
and get drunk with you,

388
00:28:21,750 --> 00:28:24,250
but I was, like, ten
minutes late last week.

389
00:28:24,333 --> 00:28:26,708
He does this thing that
my grandma used to do.

390
00:28:26,791 --> 00:28:31,333
He, like, won't tell you why he's mad,
but they'll just, like, look at you

391
00:28:31,416 --> 00:28:35,083
like a fucking chihuahua in the middle
of taking the biggest shit of its life,

392
00:28:35,166 --> 00:28:36,500
like all cockeyed, like...

393
00:28:37,416 --> 00:28:40,083
Like, it's actually quite
menacing and terrifying.

394
00:28:40,166 --> 00:28:42,250
Can't stay long. I gotta
pick Kenny up anyways.

395
00:28:42,333 --> 00:28:44,375
Why are you acting
like you're his mom?

396
00:28:44,458 --> 00:28:47,292
Trying to prove you're a good
little girlie or something?

397
00:28:47,375 --> 00:28:50,541
-Fuck off.
-Well, I'm just saying, you do too much.

398
00:28:53,666 --> 00:28:56,458
Fuck. You smell bad.
You look like shit.

399
00:28:57,125 --> 00:28:59,250
Do I? You have no idea.

400
00:29:01,708 --> 00:29:04,375
Did I tell you I just
got back from San Diego?

401
00:29:04,958 --> 00:29:07,875
He had some Senate stuff
to do in Corona Del Mar.

402
00:29:08,958 --> 00:29:10,917
We stayed at the
Hyatt. Two rooms.

403
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,667
We're still doing the whole,
like, being discreet thing,

404
00:29:13,750 --> 00:29:17,208
even though everyone knows we're
together, including his wife,

405
00:29:17,291 --> 00:29:20,208
which is a whole 'nother story, but
I'll tell you that another time.

406
00:29:20,291 --> 00:29:21,917
We're not gonna stay
at the Hyatt anymore.

407
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,917
They say the beds are Tempur-Pedic,
and they're so clearly not.

408
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,458
They're, like, cardboard.
It's false advertising.

409
00:29:27,541 --> 00:29:29,000
You grew up sleeping on a couch,

410
00:29:29,083 --> 00:29:31,708
and now you're complaining
about a fancy bed at the Hyatt?

411
00:29:31,791 --> 00:29:35,625
Oh, you know what, Lynette? Fuck
you. I told you that in confidence.

412
00:29:35,708 --> 00:29:40,333
God, you always bring...
You're so annoying!

413
00:29:40,416 --> 00:29:42,458
Ugh, this shit
doesn't even come off.

414
00:29:42,541 --> 00:29:43,750
I'll do it.

415
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:45,958
Can you open this?

416
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:51,125
-Can you hurry? I really have to go.
-Okay, Gloria. I've got a problem, okay?

417
00:29:51,208 --> 00:29:53,083
And you know that
three grand you owe me?

418
00:29:53,166 --> 00:29:56,458
I really need it tonight 'cause Doreen
fucked up the plan to buy the house.

419
00:29:56,541 --> 00:29:58,542
I need that money back, okay?

420
00:29:58,625 --> 00:30:01,000
-I knew she was gonna do that.
-Gloria.

421
00:30:01,083 --> 00:30:02,542
Gloria, I'm serious.

422
00:30:02,625 --> 00:30:04,375
-Look at this.
-Fuck.

423
00:30:04,458 --> 00:30:06,792
Look at this.
Giovanni Versace.

424
00:30:06,875 --> 00:30:08,791
That's how the Italians say it.

425
00:30:09,458 --> 00:30:11,458
What do you think? Should
I wear this tonight?

426
00:30:11,541 --> 00:30:12,500
It's kind of springy.

427
00:30:12,583 --> 00:30:14,708
Gloria, I really need
my money back tonight.

428
00:30:14,791 --> 00:30:18,042
-Nope! I'm not doing this now.
-I'm serious. We're gonna be evicted.

429
00:30:18,125 --> 00:30:20,917
-You understand?
-My car's downstairs. I'm not doing this.

430
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,708
I'm gonna be turning fucking
tricks in my car again.

431
00:30:25,541 --> 00:30:28,417
Ugh! You're literally
fucking up my vibe right now.

432
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:30,333
-Ugh.
-Babe...

433
00:30:30,416 --> 00:30:32,042
Oh my God.

434
00:30:32,125 --> 00:30:34,875
Did Robert put that there
to watch you change?

435
00:30:34,958 --> 00:30:37,250
No, don't be crude.

436
00:30:37,333 --> 00:30:41,792
I put it there. I prefer this version
anyway because he doesn't talk back.

437
00:30:41,875 --> 00:30:44,333
-Do you, Bobby? That's my boy.
-Oh my God.

438
00:30:44,416 --> 00:30:47,125
Anyway, you're just jealous
because my man is going places.

439
00:30:47,208 --> 00:30:48,291
Yeah, jail.

440
00:30:49,041 --> 00:30:52,792
Although I'm kinda stressed 'cause I
don't think he finds me sexy anymore.

441
00:30:52,875 --> 00:30:54,500
Here. Can you put this on?

442
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,708
That must be hard, but I'm not
here to talk about your sex life.

443
00:30:57,791 --> 00:30:59,750
I'm here to talk about
the money you owe me.

444
00:30:59,833 --> 00:31:02,917
All right, Lynette, take the
stick out of your ass, okay?

445
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:06,000
You can't show up unannounced and start
emotionally blackmailing me for money.

446
00:31:06,083 --> 00:31:09,000
That's what you did to me six
months ago when I bailed you out.

447
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:12,875
Lynette, I was in jail.

448
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:17,583
That situation is not this situation.
You're the only number I know by heart.

449
00:31:17,666 --> 00:31:20,583
Like, that's just the way the
chips fell. Like, okay? Relax.

450
00:31:20,666 --> 00:31:25,000
Take one look at me. How long do you think
I'd last at Columbia River Correctional?

451
00:31:25,083 --> 00:31:28,292
-Yeah, not long.
-Okay, exactly. That settles that.

452
00:31:28,375 --> 00:31:30,250
Unbelievable.

453
00:31:30,333 --> 00:31:31,875
Gloria, come on.

454
00:31:31,958 --> 00:31:34,167
Can you not ask Robert
for the fucking money?

455
00:31:34,250 --> 00:31:35,333
Ask Scott.

456
00:31:35,416 --> 00:31:36,875
I did. He said no.

457
00:31:36,958 --> 00:31:39,417
He doesn't even call me
anymore. You stole him from me.

458
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:41,417
Well, it's ended now, so...

459
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:44,542
Whatever. I know you definitely
got way more than $3,000 off him,

460
00:31:44,625 --> 00:31:45,750
so let's call it even.

461
00:31:45,833 --> 00:31:48,250
Can't you ask those two
other guys you're seeing?

462
00:31:48,333 --> 00:31:50,583
What the fuck, Lynette? I'm
not seeing them anymore.

463
00:31:50,666 --> 00:31:52,833
Well, last week you were.
Now suddenly you're not?

464
00:31:52,916 --> 00:31:54,875
What are you, the fucking feds?

465
00:31:54,958 --> 00:31:58,792
Jesus Christ, Lynette. Do you know
what would happen if Robert heard you?

466
00:31:58,875 --> 00:32:01,042
He'd throw me out! I'd be
back dancing at Mary's.

467
00:32:01,125 --> 00:32:03,292
Give me my money
and I will fuck off!

468
00:32:03,375 --> 00:32:07,542
-Ugh! My car's here. I can't do this.
-I'm gonna be working the streets, Gloria.

469
00:32:07,625 --> 00:32:10,916
-You're unbelievable!
-Kenny's gonna be taken away. How...

470
00:32:11,708 --> 00:32:13,708
Ugh!

471
00:32:14,375 --> 00:32:16,166
Really bad time, Lynette!

472
00:32:16,958 --> 00:32:18,167
My car's downstairs!

473
00:32:18,250 --> 00:32:21,875
Will you stop shouting at me?
I am asking for my own money.

474
00:32:21,958 --> 00:32:26,250
I can't just materialize $3,000
in the middle of the night!

475
00:32:26,333 --> 00:32:29,000
What the fuck do I look
like, Bank of America?

476
00:32:29,083 --> 00:32:32,833
I can't be your personal fucking ATM
machine every time you need money.

477
00:32:33,791 --> 00:32:35,833
You know what? You told me
to mind my own business!

478
00:32:35,916 --> 00:32:38,500
So you know what? I'm
minding my own business.

479
00:32:39,541 --> 00:32:42,292
Maybe that's why nothing's going
right in your fucking life.

480
00:32:42,375 --> 00:32:44,791
Maybe you need an
attitude adjustment.

481
00:32:46,583 --> 00:32:50,083
Ugh! You see, now I feel
bad. Now I fucking feel bad.

482
00:32:50,625 --> 00:32:54,250
You want the shirt off my back? You
want the wig too while you're at it?

483
00:32:57,125 --> 00:32:58,375
You know what, Lynette?

484
00:32:58,458 --> 00:33:00,333
Friends don't keep score.

485
00:33:00,416 --> 00:33:03,333
Next time I do something nice for
you, I'll make sure to keep a tally.

486
00:33:03,416 --> 00:33:05,000
How's that?

487
00:33:05,708 --> 00:33:08,667
You know what Robert would do if
he knew I had the code to his safe?

488
00:33:08,750 --> 00:33:10,083
It'd be so bad.

489
00:33:10,791 --> 00:33:11,958
Oh my God.

490
00:33:13,416 --> 00:33:15,708
He'd throw me out
of here so fast.

491
00:33:16,333 --> 00:33:19,042
Five hundred. Take it or leave
it, that's the best I can do.

492
00:33:19,125 --> 00:33:21,500
No! Five hundred? No,
I need the three grand.

493
00:33:21,583 --> 00:33:24,250
Lynette, why are you doing
this to me right now?

494
00:33:24,333 --> 00:33:25,250
My car is here!

495
00:33:25,333 --> 00:33:28,292
Do you know what? It's fine. I'm
gonna work it out. It's all fine.

496
00:33:28,375 --> 00:33:30,666
-I'm being crazy. He still likes me.
-Yes.

497
00:33:31,208 --> 00:33:32,958
Okay, want me to drop
you off somewhere?

498
00:33:33,041 --> 00:33:35,125
I just need a second.
Can I stay for a minute?

499
00:33:35,208 --> 00:33:38,333
That'd be great, actually, because
I have a package on the way.

500
00:33:40,083 --> 00:33:42,916
Okay. And don't forget
to double lock, okay?

501
00:33:44,458 --> 00:33:46,375
Love you! Bye!

502
00:34:50,833 --> 00:34:52,041
Cody.

503
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,041
Cody?

504
00:34:59,291 --> 00:35:00,333
Hi.

505
00:35:00,916 --> 00:35:03,833
I was waiting for you. I
just had a question for you.

506
00:35:05,833 --> 00:35:08,875
-I'm supposed to be catching my bus.
-No, I know. It'll take one minute.

507
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:10,917
What's up?

508
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:15,208
I've been really fucking dumb, okay? And
I put some money in my safe ages ago.

509
00:35:15,291 --> 00:35:16,375
And, um...

510
00:35:16,458 --> 00:35:18,500
Uh, you know the digital ones?

511
00:35:18,583 --> 00:35:20,667
-You know and you put the code in?
-Yeah.

512
00:35:20,750 --> 00:35:23,250
And I put it wrong three times
tonight, and it's locked.

513
00:35:23,333 --> 00:35:25,625
I wondered if you knew
how I could get it open.

514
00:35:26,583 --> 00:35:29,625
-Call a locksmith?
-I tried. It's too late.

515
00:35:29,708 --> 00:35:30,708
I don't have time.

516
00:35:30,791 --> 00:35:33,500
I need it tonight. Do you
know how I might override it?

517
00:35:33,583 --> 00:35:34,791
How would I know that?

518
00:35:36,625 --> 00:35:37,958
-Because...
-Because?

519
00:35:39,375 --> 00:35:42,792
-Well, I thought you might know how to...
-Why would you figure that?

520
00:35:42,875 --> 00:35:46,792
I just thought you might know how to get
into the safe because you did time, right?

521
00:35:46,875 --> 00:35:48,625
I did time? Who told you that?

522
00:35:49,208 --> 00:35:50,250
Tammy told me that.

523
00:35:50,333 --> 00:35:51,708
Fucking Tammy.

524
00:35:54,083 --> 00:35:56,041
-Well, do you know?
-No, uh, look.

525
00:35:56,541 --> 00:35:59,583
I'm not gonna lie. All this shit sounds
pretty fucking sketchy right now.

526
00:35:59,666 --> 00:36:02,666
-I'm just asking. I just...
-I'm gonna catch this bus, all right?

527
00:36:03,708 --> 00:36:04,750
Fuck!

528
00:36:19,083 --> 00:36:20,333
Cody? Cody.

529
00:36:20,416 --> 00:36:23,333
Cody, I'll give you $200 if
you just come and look at it.

530
00:36:25,625 --> 00:36:28,000
Cody, I will give you
money. I will give you $200.

531
00:36:28,083 --> 00:36:29,791
Just come and have a look at it.

532
00:36:31,250 --> 00:36:32,375
Just have a look.

533
00:36:34,708 --> 00:36:38,333
-What kind of safe did you say it was?
-It's just... What do you mean?

534
00:36:38,416 --> 00:36:40,458
It's just a Home Depot one.

535
00:36:42,875 --> 00:36:43,833
Where is it?

536
00:36:43,916 --> 00:36:45,291
It's at my apartment.

537
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,500
It's three minutes from here.

538
00:36:48,708 --> 00:36:49,667
What's in it?

539
00:36:49,750 --> 00:36:52,833
It's just my money that I need
to get out of there right now.

540
00:36:54,041 --> 00:36:55,417
Cody, I'm asking for your help.

541
00:36:55,500 --> 00:36:57,792
All I'm asking is for you
to come and have a look.

542
00:36:57,875 --> 00:37:00,375
-Just to look at it.
-You got a boyfriend?

543
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,666
-Mm-mm.
-Roommate, nothing like that? Live alone?

544
00:37:05,291 --> 00:37:06,458
I live alone.

545
00:37:07,875 --> 00:37:08,916
That's good.

546
00:37:10,666 --> 00:37:11,792
So?

547
00:37:11,875 --> 00:37:13,583
Okay.

548
00:37:14,708 --> 00:37:16,875
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I can
look at that for you.

549
00:37:16,958 --> 00:37:19,125
-Just look at it?
-For four hundred.

550
00:37:22,291 --> 00:37:23,583
-Four hundred?
-Yeah.

551
00:37:25,583 --> 00:37:27,417
-That's cool?
-Four hundred. Let's do it.

552
00:37:27,500 --> 00:37:29,500
-Does that work?
-Yeah, I'm down.

553
00:37:30,166 --> 00:37:31,250
Yeah, that's good.

554
00:38:11,666 --> 00:38:12,875
It's, um...

555
00:38:15,458 --> 00:38:17,583
This is a nice place
for a bartender.

556
00:38:19,375 --> 00:38:20,375
Thanks.

557
00:38:22,541 --> 00:38:24,625
So this is, um...

558
00:38:27,041 --> 00:38:28,958
Yeah. What do you think?

559
00:38:29,833 --> 00:38:31,500
That ain't from Home Depot.

560
00:38:32,791 --> 00:38:33,708
Um...

561
00:38:33,791 --> 00:38:35,000
Can we get it open?

562
00:38:35,500 --> 00:38:37,250
How am I supposed to know that?

563
00:38:39,458 --> 00:38:41,208
Well, I mean, can we not just...

564
00:38:41,291 --> 00:38:43,791
Can we, um, force
it open somehow?

565
00:38:45,208 --> 00:38:47,333
So you'd want me to break
it in? That's it, huh?

566
00:38:47,416 --> 00:38:49,375
No, it's not. I'm
giving you $400, so...

567
00:38:49,458 --> 00:38:51,542
Four hundred to look at
it, and I looked at it.

568
00:38:51,625 --> 00:38:54,667
To look at it? Okay. We're not
breaking it open. It's mine.

569
00:38:54,750 --> 00:38:55,833
It's yours?

570
00:38:56,333 --> 00:38:58,291
-Yes!
-Just like this apartment's yours?

571
00:38:59,250 --> 00:39:00,250
Yes.

572
00:39:01,041 --> 00:39:03,500
-And you're sure of that?
-Yes, I am.

573
00:39:04,083 --> 00:39:05,083
Really?

574
00:39:06,041 --> 00:39:07,416
It's my roommate's.

575
00:39:08,375 --> 00:39:10,708
Your roommate's? You
told me you lived alone.

576
00:39:10,791 --> 00:39:11,958
It's my ex-roommate's.

577
00:39:12,041 --> 00:39:15,167
So she moved out, she left her safe,
and she left all your shit in there.

578
00:39:15,250 --> 00:39:17,042
-Yes, okay?
-That's what happened, huh?

579
00:39:17,125 --> 00:39:19,083
-You're sticking with that?
-Yeah.

580
00:39:19,166 --> 00:39:21,625
Lynette, cut the bullshit.
Tell me the truth.

581
00:39:21,708 --> 00:39:24,667
It is my girlfriend's, okay? It
is my girlfriend's apartment.

582
00:39:24,750 --> 00:39:27,292
It's her boyfriend's safe that
I need to get the money out of.

583
00:39:27,375 --> 00:39:30,375
And I need to get it out tonight.
And that is the fucking truth.

584
00:39:30,458 --> 00:39:32,083
It's for my family.

585
00:39:32,583 --> 00:39:34,541
It's for my family, all right?

586
00:39:36,583 --> 00:39:38,708
You really should have
told me that before.

587
00:39:48,875 --> 00:39:49,916
I'm sorry.

588
00:39:50,583 --> 00:39:52,125
I shouldn't have lied.

589
00:39:53,333 --> 00:39:54,833
I need this, Cody.

590
00:39:56,333 --> 00:39:59,458
I can't believe I'm
doing this again.

591
00:40:00,875 --> 00:40:02,250
Look, the only way to...

592
00:40:03,291 --> 00:40:06,417
The only way to open up that safe is to
let someone drill through the layers.

593
00:40:06,500 --> 00:40:08,125
-Drill through the layers?
-Yeah.

594
00:40:08,208 --> 00:40:09,625
Can we not get them here?

595
00:40:09,708 --> 00:40:12,542
You could if you want the whole
building to know what you're doing.

596
00:40:12,625 --> 00:40:14,375
Can we not do it quietly?

597
00:40:14,458 --> 00:40:16,583
Luckily I got a drill with
a fucking silencer on it?

598
00:40:16,666 --> 00:40:19,667
No. There's no way.
We gotta take it out.

599
00:40:19,750 --> 00:40:21,708
It's not gonna be cheap, either.

600
00:40:21,791 --> 00:40:22,792
How much?

601
00:40:22,875 --> 00:40:25,958
Eight hundred.

602
00:40:30,500 --> 00:40:31,875
You wanna do it or not?

603
00:40:35,041 --> 00:40:35,958
Mm-hmm.

604
00:40:36,041 --> 00:40:38,750
-I have to.
-But you're good for it, right?

605
00:40:40,083 --> 00:40:41,583
Yeah, it's in the safe.

606
00:40:48,666 --> 00:40:51,041
You know, you better
not be fucking with me.

607
00:40:53,750 --> 00:40:54,791
Mm-hmm.

608
00:40:58,583 --> 00:40:59,791
I'll make a call.

609
00:41:05,125 --> 00:41:08,708
<i>Okay, Lynette, I get it. I
shouldn't have laughed at you.</i>

610
00:41:08,791 --> 00:41:11,500
<i>Just bring back the car,
and we can discuss it, okay?</i>

611
00:41:12,458 --> 00:41:15,208
<i>Do not be late getting
Kenny at Mona's.</i>

612
00:41:15,291 --> 00:41:17,042
<i>Mona has an early
thing tomorrow.</i>

613
00:41:19,500 --> 00:41:22,458
<i>This is an automated message
from Rose City Loans.</i>

614
00:41:22,541 --> 00:41:26,541
<i>Your account is seven weeks past
due, and a payment needs to be...</i>

615
00:41:27,375 --> 00:41:29,167
<i>Lynette, this isn't funny.</i>

616
00:41:29,250 --> 00:41:32,416
<i>You know that's my wife's
car. Tell me where it is now.</i>

617
00:41:33,750 --> 00:41:35,333
<i>You fucking piece of shit!</i>

618
00:41:35,416 --> 00:41:38,250
<i>If you've done anything to that
car, I'll fucking kill you!</i>

619
00:42:02,166 --> 00:42:03,250
Hold it.

620
00:42:06,458 --> 00:42:07,458
Thanks.

621
00:42:12,958 --> 00:42:14,375
You guys moving out?

622
00:42:15,791 --> 00:42:16,791
Yeah.

623
00:42:18,041 --> 00:42:20,167
Gentrification.

624
00:42:20,250 --> 00:42:22,000
-It's the worst.
-Yeah.

625
00:42:34,458 --> 00:42:36,500
Yeah, one second, one second.

626
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:38,458
One second.

627
00:42:39,083 --> 00:42:41,916
You gonna get that?

628
00:42:44,916 --> 00:42:48,000
-Where are we going?
-South on 82nd.

629
00:43:07,541 --> 00:43:09,333
What's your place like now?

630
00:43:09,416 --> 00:43:10,750
-My place?
-Yeah.

631
00:43:10,833 --> 00:43:12,250
-My home?
-Yeah.

632
00:43:13,083 --> 00:43:16,458
It's a bit rough. It needs
some stuff done to it.

633
00:43:17,750 --> 00:43:20,125
I got like 12 hours to
get this money or I'm...

634
00:43:20,208 --> 00:43:23,458
I'm past due on everything.

635
00:43:24,416 --> 00:43:27,625
No one will rent to me on my
own, because... You know...

636
00:43:29,166 --> 00:43:30,166
That sucks.

637
00:43:33,500 --> 00:43:34,750
Where do you live?

638
00:43:36,208 --> 00:43:37,250
Way out.

639
00:43:37,333 --> 00:43:40,708
-It's all I can get on what Tammy pays.
-Hmm.

640
00:43:41,208 --> 00:43:42,916
Two hours by bus.

641
00:43:43,416 --> 00:43:44,666
You got family?

642
00:43:45,750 --> 00:43:47,000
Not anymore.

643
00:43:49,791 --> 00:43:52,000
So this guy is okay
to open this thing?

644
00:43:52,083 --> 00:43:54,333
I mean, we're gonna
find out, right?

645
00:43:54,916 --> 00:43:58,333
And we just take the money I'm
owed out of the back, right?

646
00:43:58,416 --> 00:44:00,416
Close it, and then
we can just...

647
00:44:01,416 --> 00:44:02,541
bring it back.

648
00:44:03,125 --> 00:44:05,875
-Bring it back where?
-Back to the apartment.

649
00:44:06,416 --> 00:44:07,666
-The apartment?
-Yeah.

650
00:44:14,333 --> 00:44:15,500
It's right here.

651
00:45:23,291 --> 00:45:24,291
What's up?

652
00:45:44,875 --> 00:45:46,041
Hi, Mama.

653
00:45:46,750 --> 00:45:48,583
Hi, Mama.

654
00:45:49,875 --> 00:45:51,333
What's going on, Mama?

655
00:45:52,666 --> 00:45:54,000
Love you.

656
00:45:55,750 --> 00:45:57,500
Love you.

657
00:45:58,583 --> 00:46:02,458
Make sure she's not alone, please.
And make sure this shit is down.

658
00:46:03,166 --> 00:46:05,042
-You ready?
-Yep.

659
00:46:05,125 --> 00:46:06,375
Let's go.

660
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:19,333
Carl, wake up, wake up, wake up.

661
00:46:21,083 --> 00:46:24,791
So it's your safe, and you
forgot the combination.

662
00:46:27,208 --> 00:46:28,416
What's in it?

663
00:46:29,625 --> 00:46:30,875
Just my money.

664
00:46:31,875 --> 00:46:32,875
-Your money?
-Yeah.

665
00:46:32,958 --> 00:46:34,041
Okay.

666
00:46:35,291 --> 00:46:36,500
Let's get it.

667
00:46:37,833 --> 00:46:38,667
Keys.

668
00:46:38,750 --> 00:46:41,125
Carl, help me with
the garage, please?

669
00:46:43,250 --> 00:46:44,583
Get your shit together.

670
00:46:44,666 --> 00:46:47,333
Come on. I'm serious. Come on.

671
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:17,375
Did you carry this all the way
over here with this skinny bitch?

672
00:47:17,458 --> 00:47:20,250
-God damn.
-Come on. This way.

673
00:47:21,083 --> 00:47:23,333
Ooh-whee!

674
00:47:23,875 --> 00:47:26,208
That's a lot of fucking
money, if you ask me.

675
00:47:28,166 --> 00:47:29,916
God damn.

676
00:47:33,500 --> 00:47:36,333
Interesting...

677
00:47:56,291 --> 00:47:58,250
What the fuck is
that, Carl? Huh?

678
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:03,083
No.

679
00:48:04,375 --> 00:48:05,416
That ain't it.

680
00:48:06,833 --> 00:48:08,791
Well, you know what we gotta do.

681
00:48:14,875 --> 00:48:16,250
Gotta go old school.

682
00:48:18,708 --> 00:48:21,917
-No, don't smash it up like that. Don't...
-Shut the fuck up.

683
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:23,583
Don't do that. Fuck.

684
00:48:23,666 --> 00:48:25,917
Do not... It has to go back.

685
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,708
Yeah, one more, baby.

686
00:48:30,458 --> 00:48:32,583
There she is.

687
00:48:32,666 --> 00:48:34,333
God damn!

688
00:48:35,208 --> 00:48:36,708
What do we got here?

689
00:48:37,916 --> 00:48:39,958
Yep.

690
00:48:43,125 --> 00:48:45,583
What the fuck?

691
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:51,500
Whose safe did you
say this was again?

692
00:48:52,375 --> 00:48:53,667
It's just mine.

693
00:48:53,750 --> 00:48:54,917
-Yours?
-Yeah.

694
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:56,458
-It's yours, huh?
-Yeah.

695
00:48:57,041 --> 00:48:59,542
-All this is yours?
-Yeah.

696
00:48:59,625 --> 00:49:00,875
What do we got?

697
00:49:02,333 --> 00:49:05,041
Got some nice male Rolexes here.

698
00:49:05,541 --> 00:49:07,833
A lot of cash, and we
got a lot of cocaine.

699
00:49:18,125 --> 00:49:20,417
-How do you know her, buddy?
-A girl from the bar.

700
00:49:20,500 --> 00:49:21,708
A girl from the bar?

701
00:49:22,583 --> 00:49:24,416
-Mm-hmm.
-Hmm.

702
00:49:25,458 --> 00:49:27,083
-Carl.
-Yeah.

703
00:49:27,750 --> 00:49:30,541
The fuck you bringing
that shit to me for, bruh?

704
00:49:35,416 --> 00:49:38,042
-What the fuck are you doing?
-That's your shit, huh?

705
00:49:38,125 --> 00:49:40,292
Fuck you, it's mine. It's mine.

706
00:49:40,375 --> 00:49:42,667
-I just want my money, okay?
-That's what you want?

707
00:49:42,750 --> 00:49:45,833
If you wanted your money, then
where the fuck did this come from?

708
00:49:46,416 --> 00:49:47,333
It's a...

709
00:49:47,416 --> 00:49:48,708
It's a what?

710
00:49:50,125 --> 00:49:51,667
-It's a what?
-It's a...

711
00:49:51,750 --> 00:49:53,791
-It's mine.
-Excuse me?

712
00:49:54,333 --> 00:49:55,792
-It's mine.
-No, it's not.

713
00:49:55,875 --> 00:49:58,208
-Give me my shit now. Give me my shit.
-Whose safe is it?

714
00:49:58,291 --> 00:50:00,542
-Fuck you.
-Give me my shit!

715
00:50:00,625 --> 00:50:02,875
Bitch, who the fuck
you steal this from?

716
00:50:02,958 --> 00:50:04,458
It's a girlfriend's of mine.

717
00:50:05,041 --> 00:50:07,750
-Whose is this?
-Dude, what the fuck, man? Easy!

718
00:50:07,833 --> 00:50:10,000
I told you. It's a fucking
girlfriend's of mine.

719
00:50:10,083 --> 00:50:13,708
It's a girlfriend's now, huh?
Now we're getting to the truth.

720
00:50:13,791 --> 00:50:16,333
Just tell me where the
fucking safe is from.

721
00:50:16,416 --> 00:50:18,083
-She's an escort.
-An escort?

722
00:50:18,166 --> 00:50:20,458
Yes, she keeps it
for a business guy.

723
00:50:20,541 --> 00:50:21,875
He's not gonna know.

724
00:50:21,958 --> 00:50:25,208
-How the fuck do you know that?
-He's not gonna care.

725
00:50:25,291 --> 00:50:27,458
-Yeah?
-She's just an escort.

726
00:50:27,541 --> 00:50:29,042
She keeps it for a business guy.

727
00:50:29,125 --> 00:50:31,667
Why the fuck did you
bring it to me, huh? Hmm?

728
00:50:31,750 --> 00:50:33,333
Fucking bitch.

729
00:50:33,416 --> 00:50:35,667
They're trying to
motherfucking play us, Carl.

730
00:50:35,750 --> 00:50:38,125
What the fuck you doing?
Get the fuck off me!

731
00:50:46,666 --> 00:50:48,833
-Give it to me!
-Give me my fucking bag!

732
00:50:50,708 --> 00:50:52,333
Fuck.

733
00:50:52,416 --> 00:50:53,417
Ow!

734
00:50:53,500 --> 00:50:56,250
Fuck! Give me the bag!

735
00:50:57,625 --> 00:50:58,375
Damn it!

736
00:50:58,458 --> 00:50:59,958
Stay back.

737
00:51:02,375 --> 00:51:03,833
I'm gonna fuck you up!

738
00:51:08,333 --> 00:51:11,000
Carl!

739
00:51:12,083 --> 00:51:13,125
Shit!

740
00:51:13,208 --> 00:51:14,708
Fuck, fuck, fuck!

741
00:51:14,791 --> 00:51:17,458
Listen to me! Listen to me!

742
00:51:17,541 --> 00:51:18,958
Oh fuck.

743
00:51:19,041 --> 00:51:22,375
I'm gonna kill you!

744
00:51:25,958 --> 00:51:28,541
You are dead!

745
00:51:29,250 --> 00:51:30,917
Shit, shit...

746
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:32,958
You are dead, bitch!

747
00:51:39,666 --> 00:51:41,000
Oh God.

748
00:51:41,875 --> 00:51:42,875
Oh God.

749
00:51:55,166 --> 00:51:57,750
Get the fuck out of here!

750
00:51:59,958 --> 00:52:02,541
Listen. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

751
00:52:05,541 --> 00:52:06,583
Run!

752
00:52:09,541 --> 00:52:12,541
Cody!

753
00:52:14,250 --> 00:52:15,541
Get the fuck in!

754
00:52:54,916 --> 00:52:56,750
-Pull over.
-What? You gonna be sick?

755
00:53:00,541 --> 00:53:03,250
-Hey, pull over.
-All right, all right, all right.

756
00:53:21,583 --> 00:53:22,750
You all right?

757
00:53:33,333 --> 00:53:36,125
Lynette. Relax, okay?

758
00:53:36,208 --> 00:53:37,375
-Relax?
-Yeah.

759
00:53:37,458 --> 00:53:39,458
Uh-huh.

760
00:53:41,625 --> 00:53:44,625
Oh my God. What am I
doing? What the fuck...

761
00:53:44,708 --> 00:53:47,500
We got the money, right?

762
00:53:51,250 --> 00:53:53,833
Are you gonna answer that?

763
00:54:01,833 --> 00:54:02,875
Have a shot.

764
00:54:06,500 --> 00:54:08,333
Take the edge off a little bit.

765
00:54:08,833 --> 00:54:09,916
Take the edge off?

766
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:13,458
We're alive, right?

767
00:54:15,833 --> 00:54:17,916
Whose fucking safe
was it, anyway?

768
00:54:19,208 --> 00:54:20,333
Just some politician.

769
00:54:20,416 --> 00:54:23,500
Which means he can't come looking
for it. Not with the drugs.

770
00:54:24,500 --> 00:54:25,500
That's good.

771
00:54:29,958 --> 00:54:31,291
So you gonna count it?

772
00:54:34,666 --> 00:54:36,875
-Can I ask you something?
-Depends.

773
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:42,291
When did you get out?

774
00:54:47,125 --> 00:54:48,583
What did Tammy tell you?

775
00:54:50,083 --> 00:54:51,375
-Tammy?
-Talking Tammy.

776
00:54:51,458 --> 00:54:54,167
-You want to know what Tammy said?
-Yeah, what'd she tell you?

777
00:54:54,250 --> 00:54:57,041
-She just said that you robbed someplace.
-Mm.

778
00:54:57,833 --> 00:54:59,333
-That's what she said?
-Mm-hmm.

779
00:54:59,416 --> 00:55:02,666
-Yeah, but it's not the full story.
-What's the full story?

780
00:55:03,375 --> 00:55:04,375
I was set up.

781
00:55:07,041 --> 00:55:09,541
-You were set up?
-Yeah, that's the full story.

782
00:55:11,958 --> 00:55:13,416
Who were you set up by?

783
00:55:14,750 --> 00:55:16,042
-Some girl.
-Some girl?

784
00:55:16,125 --> 00:55:17,416
-Yeah.
-Oh.

785
00:55:19,583 --> 00:55:21,958
Supposed to be one thing,
ended up being another thing.

786
00:55:22,041 --> 00:55:23,250
Mm-hmm.

787
00:55:25,750 --> 00:55:27,541
That's life, isn't it?

788
00:56:02,541 --> 00:56:03,625
It's, uh...

789
00:56:07,125 --> 00:56:08,250
How much?

790
00:56:10,125 --> 00:56:11,125
What?

791
00:56:12,291 --> 00:56:13,583
How much is it?

792
00:56:14,916 --> 00:56:16,083
It's about $19,000.

793
00:56:20,541 --> 00:56:21,875
Nineteen grand?

794
00:56:22,500 --> 00:56:23,833
That's a lot of cash.

795
00:56:25,125 --> 00:56:27,208
You gonna take the rest
back like you said?

796
00:56:29,416 --> 00:56:30,416
Nah.

797
00:56:32,916 --> 00:56:36,166
No, I need it. I need it for
the house I told you about.

798
00:56:37,208 --> 00:56:40,958
We were supposed to close
on it today, and I...

799
00:56:41,458 --> 00:56:44,375
If I don't get it by
tomorrow morning, I'm fucked.

800
00:56:46,083 --> 00:56:47,083
I just...

801
00:56:47,666 --> 00:56:49,333
want to have one win, you know?

802
00:56:52,333 --> 00:56:55,125
I've hurt a lot of people
that I care about and...

803
00:56:56,625 --> 00:56:59,125
done some really bad
things, and I just...

804
00:57:00,083 --> 00:57:01,666
I've just...

805
00:57:02,875 --> 00:57:05,000
come way too far not to, so...

806
00:57:05,708 --> 00:57:06,958
Yeah.

807
00:57:09,625 --> 00:57:10,791
I just...

808
00:57:12,791 --> 00:57:17,541
I just need... I just fucking...
need only four grand more.

809
00:57:20,291 --> 00:57:21,458
Four grand, huh?

810
00:57:25,166 --> 00:57:26,166
Mm.

811
00:57:36,166 --> 00:57:37,458
What you laughing about?

812
00:57:38,625 --> 00:57:39,625
Um...

813
00:57:42,333 --> 00:57:43,916
You don't, uh...

814
00:57:44,916 --> 00:57:47,833
You don't know anyone who
would take a Mercedes, do you?

815
00:57:47,916 --> 00:57:50,708
-What, now you got a Mercedes?
-Yeah, I got a Mercedes.

816
00:57:51,375 --> 00:57:53,458
Let me guess, belongs to
the dude with the safe?

817
00:57:53,541 --> 00:57:56,666
-No, different guy, actually.
-Different guy? Jesus.

818
00:57:57,208 --> 00:57:59,833
But it's his wife's, so I don't
think he's gonna report it,

819
00:57:59,916 --> 00:58:02,625
because he'd have to
tell her who took it.

820
00:58:11,583 --> 00:58:15,000
I think I can get you that four
grand if the Mercedes is real.

821
00:58:15,708 --> 00:58:18,250
-You could get four grand right now?
-I can get four grand.

822
00:58:19,708 --> 00:58:21,125
I gotta see it first.

823
00:58:22,208 --> 00:58:24,541
-Make sure you're not fucking with me.
-Mm.

824
00:58:26,291 --> 00:58:28,791
You show me the money,
I'll take you to the car.

825
00:58:35,083 --> 00:58:36,083
Let's do it.

826
00:58:37,458 --> 00:58:39,625
We have to go to my
place to get the cash.

827
00:58:46,041 --> 00:58:47,792
<i>Where are you? I'm at work.</i>

828
00:58:47,875 --> 00:58:50,500
<i>Mona is freaking out.
Kenny's over there crying.</i>

829
00:58:50,583 --> 00:58:53,625
<i>You were supposed to be there hours
ago. He thinks you're not coming back.</i>

830
00:58:53,708 --> 00:58:55,583
-Fuck.
<i>-Why do you keep pulling this shit?</i>

831
00:58:58,541 --> 00:59:01,542
I'm sorry, it just... it
won't happen again, Mona.

832
00:59:01,625 --> 00:59:03,500
-Don't worry about it.
-It was a really...

833
00:59:03,583 --> 00:59:05,542
-Messed up day at work, and I just...
-Mm-hmm.

834
00:59:05,625 --> 00:59:07,667
You know, it was...
It was tough today.

835
00:59:07,750 --> 00:59:10,292
I love you, Mona.

836
00:59:10,375 --> 00:59:11,958
I love you too, Kenny.

837
00:59:12,625 --> 00:59:13,750
See you soon.

838
00:59:15,041 --> 00:59:18,958
Ken, I'm sorry, babe. I just...
I had a crazy day at work.

839
00:59:19,041 --> 00:59:22,958
And it was, you know... Tammy
was just the worst, and...

840
00:59:23,041 --> 00:59:25,292
You... Do you forgive
me for being late?

841
00:59:25,375 --> 00:59:26,583
-Yeah.
-Yeah?

842
00:59:27,291 --> 00:59:28,500
You had a good time?

843
00:59:29,166 --> 00:59:32,958
Okay, there's a guy in the car that...
we're gonna drop him off somewhere quick.

844
00:59:33,041 --> 00:59:36,208
-And then we're gonna go eat, okay?
-Is he a stranger?

845
00:59:36,291 --> 00:59:38,208
No, no, he's a...
He's a cool guy.

846
00:59:38,291 --> 00:59:39,958
-Really, really?
-Yeah, he's cool.

847
00:59:40,041 --> 00:59:41,708
-Really cool?
-Yeah, he's a cool guy.

848
00:59:41,791 --> 00:59:43,208
-Yeah?
-He's a really cool guy.

849
00:59:43,291 --> 00:59:45,125
-Okay!
-He's cool, this one, okay?

850
00:59:45,208 --> 00:59:46,625
This one's cool.

851
00:59:46,708 --> 00:59:47,875
Be cool, Ken.

852
00:59:51,166 --> 00:59:53,750
-That's my seat.
-In the back, babe.

853
00:59:59,916 --> 01:00:01,833
Uh, this is... Uh,
this is Cody, Kenny.

854
01:00:01,916 --> 01:00:04,000
-Hey, Cody.
-What's going on?

855
01:00:04,083 --> 01:00:05,166
Doing good.

856
01:00:12,708 --> 01:00:14,916
Uh, Cody is your boyfriend?

857
01:00:17,083 --> 01:00:19,833
No, he's just a... He's
just a guy that I work with.

858
01:00:19,916 --> 01:00:21,000
Cool.

859
01:00:22,083 --> 01:00:23,667
You got a girlfriend, Kenny?

860
01:00:23,750 --> 01:00:26,167
-Yeah.
-You got two girlfriends, haven't you?

861
01:00:26,250 --> 01:00:29,125
-Yeah.
-My man! What's their names?

862
01:00:29,208 --> 01:00:30,833
Erica, Azica.

863
01:00:30,916 --> 01:00:33,958
-One of them broke it off though, no?
-Got your heart broken, Kenny?

864
01:00:34,041 --> 01:00:38,667
Yeah. We have been
together the whole time.

865
01:00:38,750 --> 01:00:42,333
But the problem is
about, you know...

866
01:00:42,416 --> 01:00:46,208
somebody else broke
it off from us.

867
01:00:46,291 --> 01:00:48,208
That's shitty. I feel you, man.

868
01:00:49,583 --> 01:00:51,083
-Kenny's a DJ.
-For real?

869
01:00:51,166 --> 01:00:52,333
-Yeah.
-Yes, I am.

870
01:00:52,416 --> 01:00:54,875
-What's your DJ name?
-DJ Kenny.

871
01:00:54,958 --> 01:00:56,250

01:00:56,333 --> 01:00:58,792

01:00:58,875 --> 01:01:00,500

You scared me.

01:03:43,833 --> 01:03:46,083
-Can you open the door?
-Did you get it?

900
01:03:46,666 --> 01:03:47,916
Yeah. How's that?

901
01:03:51,958 --> 01:03:53,958
All right.

902
01:04:09,500 --> 01:04:10,541
Is that it?

903
01:04:11,583 --> 01:04:12,583
Yeah.

904
01:04:13,083 --> 01:04:14,666
Why is the door open?

905
01:04:15,208 --> 01:04:17,333
Because I panicked.

906
01:04:18,833 --> 01:04:20,917
Fuck, I can't believe
it's still there.

907
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:23,250
-You got the key?
-It's in the bag.

908
01:04:25,125 --> 01:04:26,333
All right, all right.

909
01:04:35,750 --> 01:04:38,083
I showed you the car. You
gonna show me the cash?

910
01:04:38,166 --> 01:04:40,750
You want $4,000 for
a stolen Mercedes?

911
01:04:41,833 --> 01:04:42,833
Yeah.

912
01:04:43,291 --> 01:04:45,458
You know, after everything
we did together...

913
01:04:46,500 --> 01:04:47,875
you ever think of me?

914
01:04:49,291 --> 01:04:51,458
You didn't even
give me the $800.

915
01:04:54,750 --> 01:04:57,458
But I was... I was gonna
give you some money.

916
01:04:57,541 --> 01:05:00,458
Yeah, but you could've
done that back at the deli.

917
01:05:01,333 --> 01:05:02,333
Why didn't you?

918
01:05:04,250 --> 01:05:05,416
Well, because...

919
01:05:06,916 --> 01:05:07,916
Mm.

920
01:05:08,500 --> 01:05:10,625
Because we made a
deal on the car.

921
01:05:10,708 --> 01:05:12,291
Look, there's a new deal.

922
01:05:14,125 --> 01:05:15,208
I want half.

923
01:05:15,791 --> 01:05:16,958
Half the cash.

924
01:05:17,583 --> 01:05:18,916
You want half of the...

925
01:05:19,708 --> 01:05:22,791
-But the car's worth so much more...
-I want to split the cash.

926
01:05:24,083 --> 01:05:27,292
A stolen fuckin' Mercedes. You have any
clue the danger you're putting me in?

927
01:05:27,375 --> 01:05:29,542
What are you talking about?
You offered four grand.

928
01:05:29,625 --> 01:05:32,708
Want your four grand? Look,
this is what your four grand is.

929
01:05:32,791 --> 01:05:35,458
-That was fucking bullshit?
-Yeah, it was fucking bullshit.

930
01:05:35,541 --> 01:05:37,917
I've been lying to you like
you've been lying to me.

931
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:39,917
-Calm down.
-Lynette, split the money.

932
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:41,958
-That was not the deal.
-It's only fair.

933
01:05:42,041 --> 01:05:45,375
-The fucking car is worth 50 times...
-After all the shit we've done?

934
01:05:45,458 --> 01:05:47,042
I don't give a
fuck about the car!

935
01:05:47,125 --> 01:05:49,458
-I need this.
-What do you need it for, huh?

936
01:05:50,291 --> 01:05:51,708
I need money too! I got nothing!

937
01:05:51,791 --> 01:05:53,917
-I told you I needed it.
-I got a shitty parole job.

938
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:56,542
You know what? Fuck your house!
Now I want the whole thing.

939
01:05:56,625 --> 01:05:57,792
-No.
-Yes.

940
01:05:57,875 --> 01:06:00,417
-No. That was not the deal.
-Give me the fucking bag.

941
01:06:00,500 --> 01:06:02,667
-Give me the fucking bag, Lynette.
-Fuck you.

942
01:06:02,750 --> 01:06:04,500
Give me the fucking
bag, Lynette!

943
01:06:04,583 --> 01:06:05,958
Leave my sister alone!

944
01:06:06,041 --> 01:06:07,750
-Don't...
-Give me the bag!

945
01:06:07,833 --> 01:06:09,625
-Leave her alone.
-I'm not fuckin' with you.

946
01:06:09,708 --> 01:06:12,375
-Leave my sister alone.
-Shut the fuck up, Kenny.

947
01:06:12,458 --> 01:06:13,833
Please don't do this.

948
01:06:13,916 --> 01:06:16,375
-Give me the bag, Lynette!
-No, I need it!

949
01:06:16,458 --> 01:06:18,708
-I need it!
-Give me the fucking bag! Give me the bag!

950
01:06:18,791 --> 01:06:21,833
-Don't do this!
-Give me the fucking bag!

951
01:06:21,916 --> 01:06:24,083
-Don't do it!
-Give me the fucking...

952
01:06:24,166 --> 01:06:25,250
Give it to me!

953
01:06:26,708 --> 01:06:28,750
Why are you doing this?

954
01:06:28,833 --> 01:06:30,292
Leave my sister alone!

955
01:06:30,375 --> 01:06:31,708
Jesus fucking Christ.

956
01:06:31,791 --> 01:06:33,750
Okay, okay, okay.
Kenny, it's fine.

957
01:06:33,833 --> 01:06:35,333
It's fine. Don't worry.

958
01:06:36,083 --> 01:06:37,375
Okay, okay, okay.

959
01:06:37,458 --> 01:06:40,208
You made me do it. You
know you made me do it.

960
01:06:58,833 --> 01:07:00,333
Fuck you!

961
01:07:41,416 --> 01:07:43,083
Fuck you...

962
01:07:44,750 --> 01:07:46,250
Fuck you, Lynette.

963
01:08:39,250 --> 01:08:42,208
I am worried about you.

964
01:08:43,625 --> 01:08:44,958
So much.

965
01:08:45,791 --> 01:08:49,708
Why... Why you have
to act so crazy?

966
01:09:24,166 --> 01:09:25,166
Ken?

967
01:09:29,125 --> 01:09:31,667
Uh, he'll have the pancakes
with syrup and butter.

968
01:09:31,750 --> 01:09:35,333
-But can you put the syrup on the side?
-Yeah, I can do that. For you?

969
01:09:35,416 --> 01:09:38,333
Just coffee, black. Just
make sure it's on the side.

970
01:09:38,416 --> 01:09:39,833
-Yeah.
-Thanks.

971
01:09:46,458 --> 01:09:50,000
Do you remember when Daddy used to go
to that place and he met that busboy?

972
01:09:50,083 --> 01:09:52,750
What was his name? He used
to speak Lithuanian with him.

973
01:09:52,833 --> 01:09:56,417
He used to love speaking his own language.
You remember that? What was his name?

974
01:09:56,500 --> 01:09:58,375
Dominykas. Do you remember?

975
01:09:59,916 --> 01:10:03,041
Remember I wanted us to go on a
trip there? I wanted us to, um...

976
01:10:03,541 --> 01:10:05,833
go get a couple of
passports and run away.

977
01:10:05,916 --> 01:10:07,666
Get us the hell out of here.

978
01:10:13,125 --> 01:10:14,083
Kenny.

979
01:10:14,166 --> 01:10:16,250
Kenny, look at me.

980
01:10:16,833 --> 01:10:19,375
Cody was not a good
guy. He was a bad guy.

981
01:10:19,458 --> 01:10:21,875
He wasn't a cool
guy. I got it wrong.

982
01:10:28,083 --> 01:10:32,250
And he was trying to steal the house. The
house we've lived in our entire lives.

983
01:10:33,833 --> 01:10:35,083
Is that what you want?

984
01:10:35,583 --> 01:10:37,750
I miss my dad.

985
01:10:42,166 --> 01:10:43,166
I know.

986
01:10:44,125 --> 01:10:47,166
I know you do. Dad left
us, Ken. You know that.

987
01:10:48,500 --> 01:10:50,541
Okay? And, um...

988
01:10:56,833 --> 01:10:58,291
I still love you.

989
01:10:59,416 --> 01:11:01,625
But I can't stand it.

990
01:11:01,708 --> 01:11:05,541
-What? What can't you stand?
-A lot of shit stuff.

991
01:11:10,875 --> 01:11:12,292
Yeah, okay, well, I got angry.

992
01:11:12,375 --> 01:11:14,958
I got angry because he was
trying to steal from us, okay?

993
01:11:15,041 --> 01:11:16,667
He was trying to steal from us.

994
01:11:16,750 --> 01:11:18,125
That's why I got angry.

995
01:11:18,208 --> 01:11:22,625
I know that. Dad told
me to protect you.

996
01:11:22,708 --> 01:11:24,750
You're supposed to be
my big brother. Are you?

997
01:11:24,833 --> 01:11:25,958
Yes.

998
01:11:27,291 --> 01:11:29,625
You're my big brother, okay?
I'm your little sister.

999
01:11:29,708 --> 01:11:32,833
Are you gonna be in this with me
or not? You gonna help me or not?

1000
01:11:32,916 --> 01:11:37,458
I am the man of the family,
and I'm going to help you.

1001
01:11:37,541 --> 01:11:39,000
You're the man of the family.

1002
01:11:39,083 --> 01:11:41,333
That's why me and you are
gonna do this together.

1003
01:11:41,416 --> 01:11:43,167
-Yes.
-We're in it together.

1004
01:11:43,250 --> 01:11:45,208
We're gonna do it for the
family, and know what?

1005
01:11:45,291 --> 01:11:46,625
We're gonna fuckin' do it.

1006
01:11:46,708 --> 01:11:48,917
We're gonna go together and
get the fucking money, okay?

1007
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:49,917
-Okay.
-We are?

1008
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:51,000
Yes.

1009
01:12:41,750 --> 01:12:43,125
<i>Hello?</i>

1010
01:12:46,083 --> 01:12:47,416
Hi, is Tommy there?

1011
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:50,833
<i>Um, who is this?</i>

1012
01:12:52,083 --> 01:12:54,166
Just tell him it's Lynette.

1013
01:12:59,083 --> 01:13:01,541
<i>What the fuck? Wait there.</i>

1014
01:13:10,875 --> 01:13:12,250
Now, look who it is.

1015
01:13:13,041 --> 01:13:14,375
Long time, huh?

1016
01:13:15,791 --> 01:13:17,666
What brings you here, Lynette?

1017
01:13:18,416 --> 01:13:19,666
You still sell stuff?

1018
01:13:20,375 --> 01:13:23,458
-You see the store standing, don't you?
-Yeah, maybe.

1019
01:13:24,958 --> 01:13:25,708
Whoa.

1020
01:13:25,791 --> 01:13:27,833
Whoa! Not here.

1021
01:13:39,250 --> 01:13:41,042
So you must be the famous Kenny.

1022
01:13:41,125 --> 01:13:43,125
-Yes, I am.
-Yes, you are.

1023
01:13:43,208 --> 01:13:45,541
You know what? Here,
check this out.

1024
01:13:46,875 --> 01:13:48,917
-<i>I am Zoltar...</i>
-Awesome!

1025
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:50,791
Yeah? You ever played one?

1026
01:13:51,375 --> 01:13:53,417
-Uh, yes, I have.
-Hey. Let's go.

1027
01:13:53,500 --> 01:13:56,583
Old-school pinball. You don't
need tokens or anything.

1028
01:13:56,666 --> 01:13:58,250
It's... You know how to play?

1029
01:13:58,333 --> 01:13:59,833
-Uh, yes.
-You do?

1030
01:13:59,916 --> 01:14:01,083
-Yes.
-All right.

1031
01:14:01,166 --> 01:14:04,000
<i>Come on over and let
Zoltar be sharing...</i>

1032
01:14:04,083 --> 01:14:07,333
I just gotta talk to Tommy
for five minutes, okay?

1033
01:14:27,500 --> 01:14:30,417
Jesus Christ. What the fuck?
Where did you get this?

1034
01:14:30,500 --> 01:14:34,250
Loose lips sink ships. Isn't
that what you taught us, Tommy?

1035
01:14:37,333 --> 01:14:38,708
That's fucking good.

1036
01:14:41,833 --> 01:14:43,333
Who is that upstairs?

1037
01:14:45,666 --> 01:14:47,833
That's none of your
fucking business.

1038
01:14:48,833 --> 01:14:51,375
And if you gotta know,
that's my girlfriend.

1039
01:14:51,458 --> 01:14:52,708
Nice.

1040
01:14:53,666 --> 01:14:55,416
It's your girlfriend, really?

1041
01:14:57,541 --> 01:14:59,750
You don't get to
come to my place,

1042
01:14:59,833 --> 01:15:02,083
middle of the night, and
start giving me shit, Lynette.

1043
01:15:02,166 --> 01:15:05,041
Just like all the years you gave
me shit? Five years of shit?

1044
01:15:06,041 --> 01:15:08,625
I never wanted you to
live here. You begged.

1045
01:15:08,708 --> 01:15:11,917
I begged because I was a kid, and I
was fucked up. That's why I begged.

1046
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:13,792
I was looking for help, Tommy.

1047
01:15:13,875 --> 01:15:16,208
You weren't that much
of a kid, were you?

1048
01:15:17,083 --> 01:15:18,750
-Fuck you.
-Lyn?

1049
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:21,000
Lyn?

1050
01:15:22,625 --> 01:15:23,625
Lyn?

1051
01:15:24,125 --> 01:15:25,917
-What's up?
-You okay?

1052
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:27,833
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Two minutes, okay?

1053
01:15:27,916 --> 01:15:29,458
-Okay.
-Okay.

1054
01:15:29,541 --> 01:15:31,458
Cool. Be out in a second.

1055
01:15:45,500 --> 01:15:49,083
How many of those girls have
you had upstairs since me, huh?

1056
01:15:51,458 --> 01:15:52,583
I don't do that anymore.

1057
01:15:52,666 --> 01:15:55,666
You don't make your girlfriends
sleep with other guys?

1058
01:15:58,000 --> 01:15:59,208
You know, I was...

1059
01:16:03,958 --> 01:16:07,666
You know, you had me so fucked up, I
thought I was in love with you, Tommy.

1060
01:16:12,791 --> 01:16:15,625
What you made me
do... was wrong.

1061
01:16:16,958 --> 01:16:18,208
A long time ago.

1062
01:16:19,875 --> 01:16:21,833
I did what I did to get by.

1063
01:16:22,416 --> 01:16:23,333
I was 16.

1064
01:16:31,250 --> 01:16:34,917
So how much are you gonna pay me
for that? How much is it worth?

1065
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:36,708
It's a fucking half a kilo.

1066
01:16:36,791 --> 01:16:39,042
I do not have six grand
just fucking laying around.

1067
01:16:39,125 --> 01:16:42,167
So you don't have cash anymore,
like you always used to,

1068
01:16:42,250 --> 01:16:43,583
when I was upstairs?

1069
01:16:45,875 --> 01:16:47,708
You can find someone
that's gonna buy it.

1070
01:16:47,791 --> 01:16:49,000
-No.
-Yes you can. Right now.

1071
01:16:49,083 --> 01:16:53,666
I do not have to do
fucking anything for you.

1072
01:16:54,333 --> 01:16:56,541
This is the least
you could do.

1073
01:16:57,875 --> 01:16:59,125
Take your coke.

1074
01:17:10,583 --> 01:17:11,833
Look at you.

1075
01:17:12,583 --> 01:17:14,166
I'm really fucking sorry.

1076
01:17:54,583 --> 01:17:56,083
My guy'll give you three.

1077
01:17:56,708 --> 01:17:57,958
No, I need four.

1078
01:17:59,458 --> 01:18:01,667
It's the middle of the
night. You know someone else

1079
01:18:01,750 --> 01:18:04,625
who's gonna give you more money
for your coke, go to them.

1080
01:18:04,708 --> 01:18:06,250
Okay, what's the address?

1081
01:18:06,333 --> 01:18:09,375
His name's Blake. You know
those houses in Meadow Vale?

1082
01:18:09,458 --> 01:18:10,500
Up in the hills?

1083
01:18:10,583 --> 01:18:12,083
How could I forget?

1084
01:18:12,166 --> 01:18:14,041
Ring the gate when
you get there.

1085
01:18:16,041 --> 01:18:18,166
I give this to you
on one condition.

1086
01:18:18,875 --> 01:18:22,167
I don't want you to ever come here again.
Don't call, don't show up. Nothing.

1087
01:18:22,250 --> 01:18:23,250
You got it?

1088
01:18:27,541 --> 01:18:30,541
You should take these.
They belong to you.

1089
01:18:32,958 --> 01:18:34,375
Show yourself out.

1090
01:18:36,041 --> 01:18:38,916
You don't get to pretend
it didn't happen, Tommy.

1091
01:18:46,833 --> 01:18:48,000
Kenny, come on.

1092
01:18:49,875 --> 01:18:50,875
Okay.

1093
01:19:08,041 --> 01:19:09,166
It's okay, Kenny.

1094
01:19:52,416 --> 01:19:54,042
<i>She looks innocent.</i>

1095
01:19:54,125 --> 01:19:55,333
<i>She's not.</i>

1096
01:19:55,416 --> 01:19:56,833
<i>You were right, Tommy!</i>

1097
01:19:56,916 --> 01:20:00,000
-<i>She's wild.</i>
<i>-How much to take her upstairs?</i>

1098
01:20:00,083 --> 01:20:02,458
<i>You weren't that much of
a kid, though, were you?</i>

1099
01:20:02,541 --> 01:20:05,375
<i>...that much of a kid...
I don't want to hear.</i>

1100
01:20:05,458 --> 01:20:07,458
<i>You take good care of
my friend here, okay?</i>

1101
01:20:09,875 --> 01:20:11,166
<i>He already paid.</i>

1102
01:20:11,666 --> 01:20:12,708
<i>He already paid.</i>

1103
01:20:13,291 --> 01:20:15,416
<i>He's paying, so
you be real nice.</i>

1104
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:57,125
-I don't like it here.
-I know. It's okay.

1105
01:20:57,916 --> 01:20:59,333
It's me and you, yeah?

1106
01:21:04,541 --> 01:21:06,833
I'll call you who
the fuck you are!

1107
01:21:06,916 --> 01:21:09,458
You act like a bitch, I
call you a fucking bitch!

1108
01:21:09,541 --> 01:21:11,583
Why the fuck did I
even bring you out?

1109
01:21:11,666 --> 01:21:15,000
Bitch, why would I stay home
with you, you dirty-ass bitch?

1110
01:21:42,708 --> 01:21:44,750
Start making my
friends richer...

1111
01:22:03,375 --> 01:22:04,625
Okay, meet here, yeah?

1112
01:22:04,708 --> 01:22:06,750
-Are you sure?
-Stay right here.

1113
01:22:15,416 --> 01:22:17,292
Alone at last.

1114
01:22:17,375 --> 01:22:19,708
Away from all those
horrid people.

1115
01:22:20,916 --> 01:22:22,083
Care for a drink?

1116
01:22:22,625 --> 01:22:23,500
No.

1117
01:22:23,583 --> 01:22:26,250
Oh, do you mind the
shoes on the rug?

1118
01:22:26,333 --> 01:22:28,208
I try to keep it clean.

1119
01:22:29,916 --> 01:22:30,916
Uh...

1120
01:22:31,416 --> 01:22:33,125
I mean, I'll just stand here.

1121
01:22:35,708 --> 01:22:40,417
Did you know there's
421,000 units of bacteria

1122
01:22:40,500 --> 01:22:43,292
on the single sole of a shoe?

1123
01:22:43,375 --> 01:22:45,583
-Here you go.
-No, I'm all good. Thanks.

1124
01:22:45,666 --> 01:22:47,958
Well, it's right
here if you want it.

1125
01:22:49,125 --> 01:22:51,416
So... tell me.

1126
01:22:54,416 --> 01:22:56,000
Friend of Tommy's?

1127
01:22:56,875 --> 01:22:58,292
How should we do this?

1128
01:22:58,375 --> 01:22:59,875
You want to see the stuff?

1129
01:22:59,958 --> 01:23:01,333
No, no, no. I trust you.

1130
01:23:01,416 --> 01:23:04,875
I don't know you, but I trust Tommy.
I mean, how do you want to get paid?

1131
01:23:04,958 --> 01:23:06,958
-PayPal?
-No.

1132
01:23:07,041 --> 01:23:08,166
OnlyFans?

1133
01:23:09,291 --> 01:23:11,625
-I'm a very good tipper.
-No, I need cash.

1134
01:23:11,708 --> 01:23:13,375
Cash, yeah.

1135
01:23:14,083 --> 01:23:17,000
Probably best not to have our
fingerprints all over each other.

1136
01:23:17,875 --> 01:23:18,875
Cash it is.

1137
01:23:19,375 --> 01:23:20,375
Don't worry.

1138
01:23:21,041 --> 01:23:22,250
I got it right here.

1139
01:23:22,833 --> 01:23:23,958
What did we say?

1140
01:23:24,541 --> 01:23:27,250
-$2,000, right?
-I agreed with Tommy $3,000.

1141
01:23:27,333 --> 01:23:29,458
$2,000 is for the coke.

1142
01:23:30,083 --> 01:23:32,000
You know what? Now
it's gone up to $4,000.

1143
01:23:32,083 --> 01:23:35,083
So you can give me the money or
I can get the fuck out of here.

1144
01:23:37,750 --> 01:23:39,125
Four thousand.

1145
01:23:45,541 --> 01:23:48,042
Tommy said you were fucking
wild back in the day.

1146
01:23:48,125 --> 01:23:49,625
I'm sorry, what?

1147
01:23:50,208 --> 01:23:52,666
Tommy said you used
to be pretty wild.

1148
01:23:58,166 --> 01:23:59,500
When I was 16, yeah.

1149
01:24:02,166 --> 01:24:04,750
So is this like a
trip down memory lane?

1150
01:24:04,833 --> 01:24:07,541
The money, and the drugs,
late-night parties.

1151
01:24:08,125 --> 01:24:12,041
I just want to know,
are you still wild?

1152
01:24:16,291 --> 01:24:19,666
Careful. Because you seem,
like, a little bit still wild.

1153
01:24:20,583 --> 01:24:23,667
Look, I'm... I don't know
what you think is happening.

1154
01:24:23,750 --> 01:24:26,667
I don't care what Tommy said.
That's not... That's not it, okay?

1155
01:24:26,750 --> 01:24:28,500
Not gonna argue. Give
me the fucking money.

1156
01:24:28,583 --> 01:24:30,666
Clearly, you know what
it is. Here you go.

1157
01:24:31,541 --> 01:24:33,333
Oops, it slipped.

1158
01:24:38,083 --> 01:24:39,208
It's yours.

1159
01:24:50,958 --> 01:24:52,000
$1,000.

1160
01:24:53,666 --> 01:24:54,958
$2,000.

1161
01:24:56,291 --> 01:24:57,625
What? It's yours.

1162
01:24:57,708 --> 01:24:59,458
Some over there.
Some over there.

1163
01:25:00,333 --> 01:25:01,541
Good girl.

1164
01:25:02,458 --> 01:25:04,000
And $4,000.

1165
01:25:25,750 --> 01:25:27,917
-Get out of my way.
-I'm not in your way.

1166
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:30,416
-Yeah, get out of my fucking way.
-Look.

1167
01:25:31,166 --> 01:25:33,958
-I'm not doing anything. I just need...
-Just get out of my way.

1168
01:25:34,041 --> 01:25:36,833
-I just need to know that you're calm.
-Move out of my way.

1169
01:25:36,916 --> 01:25:38,958
-Okay, I will.
-Move out of my way.

1170
01:25:39,041 --> 01:25:40,042
-No.
-I'm gonna move.

1171
01:25:40,125 --> 01:25:41,708
-I'm gonna move.
-No, don't do that.

1172
01:25:41,791 --> 01:25:42,958
-Careful.
-Do not do that.

1173
01:25:43,041 --> 01:25:45,666
Don't scratch. I
pay extra for that.

1174
01:25:46,333 --> 01:25:48,792
Do not do that. Do
not fucking do that.

1175
01:25:48,875 --> 01:25:51,875
Stop fucking touching me! You
think you can fucking buy me?

1176
01:25:51,958 --> 01:25:54,208
You think I'm fucking
trash? That what you think?

1177
01:25:54,291 --> 01:25:57,042
You think because you have
money, you can buy me.

1178
01:25:57,125 --> 01:25:59,292
-Jesus!
-You aren't gonna fucking touch me!

1179
01:25:59,375 --> 01:26:01,708
-You understand that?
-Oh my God! You're fucking crazy.

1180
01:26:01,791 --> 01:26:03,875
Crazy? Fucking crazy?

1181
01:26:03,958 --> 01:26:05,375
Want to see fucking crazy?

1182
01:26:05,458 --> 01:26:07,791
Fucking touch me!
Don't fucking touch me!

1183
01:26:08,500 --> 01:26:10,333
Don't fucking touch me!

1184
01:26:36,875 --> 01:26:39,708
<i>You weren't that much of
a kid, though, were you?</i>

1185
01:26:53,500 --> 01:26:55,250
Shh.

1186
01:27:00,666 --> 01:27:02,000
There's no rush.

1187
01:27:02,500 --> 01:27:03,500
Yeah?

1188
01:27:29,750 --> 01:27:32,500
<i>I don't want to go
upstairs with him, Tommy.</i>

1189
01:27:36,333 --> 01:27:39,125
<i>Take your dress down. Come on.</i>

1190
01:27:44,541 --> 01:27:47,167
-Stay back.
-Okay. You got your money.

1191
01:27:47,250 --> 01:27:48,416
Shh.

1192
01:27:49,000 --> 01:27:49,875
Calm down.

1193
01:27:49,958 --> 01:27:51,166
No!

1194
01:27:51,666 --> 01:27:55,375
Fuck! Fucking bitch!

1195
01:27:55,458 --> 01:27:56,666
Kenny?

1196
01:27:57,500 --> 01:28:00,416
Kenny?

1197
01:28:01,166 --> 01:28:02,541
Kenny!

1198
01:28:07,541 --> 01:28:08,541
Kenny?

1199
01:28:09,333 --> 01:28:10,333
Kenny?

1200
01:28:11,291 --> 01:28:12,291
Kenny?

1201
01:28:15,000 --> 01:28:16,083
Where are you?

1202
01:28:17,708 --> 01:28:19,166
What the fuck?

1203
01:28:19,875 --> 01:28:21,541
Is that glass? Is it...

1204
01:28:22,125 --> 01:28:23,125
What the fuck...

1205
01:28:23,208 --> 01:28:25,542
-Where's my brother?
-Put the glass down.

1206
01:28:25,625 --> 01:28:28,167
She fucking attacked me!
She stole my fucking money!

1207
01:28:28,250 --> 01:28:29,541
Relax. Fuck...

1208
01:28:30,208 --> 01:28:32,125
Don't fucking touch me!

1209
01:28:32,208 --> 01:28:35,292
-Get her.
-Don't fucking touch me!

1210
01:28:35,375 --> 01:28:38,083
Put it down, bitch.

1211
01:28:39,333 --> 01:28:41,250
Hold her down,
man! Hold her down!

1212
01:28:41,333 --> 01:28:43,125
-Lyn!
-Kenny!

1213
01:28:43,208 --> 01:28:45,542
Lyn! Leave my sister alone!

1214
01:28:45,625 --> 01:28:48,458
Somebody fucking stop
this psycho bitch!

1215
01:28:56,125 --> 01:28:58,750
-I'm sorry.
-Are you... Are you okay?

1216
01:28:58,833 --> 01:29:00,625
I'm fine. I'm fine.

1217
01:29:01,541 --> 01:29:02,625
I'm sorry.

1218
01:29:07,125 --> 01:29:08,791
Hey. Sorry.

1219
01:29:09,333 --> 01:29:11,250
What the fuck, man?

1220
01:29:15,583 --> 01:29:17,416
Get the fuck out of my house.

1221
01:29:31,125 --> 01:29:33,791
I got the money,
baby. I got the money.

1222
01:29:35,875 --> 01:29:37,708
Let's go home.

1223
01:29:38,958 --> 01:29:40,792
Let's go home. Okay.

1224
01:29:40,875 --> 01:29:41,875
Okay.

1225
01:31:12,916 --> 01:31:15,333
It's over now. Get
some sleep, Ken.

1226
01:31:37,875 --> 01:31:39,083
Good night?

1227
01:31:39,875 --> 01:31:42,583
You take good care
of your brother?

1228
01:31:45,458 --> 01:31:49,833
Yeah. I spent the night getting
the money that you blew on the car.

1229
01:31:49,916 --> 01:31:51,583
All $25,000.

1230
01:31:52,625 --> 01:31:54,250
And we're out of time.

1231
01:31:54,333 --> 01:31:57,375
So please, please get dressed.

1232
01:31:58,166 --> 01:32:00,166
And come with me
to sign the loan.

1233
01:32:00,708 --> 01:32:01,958
Please.

1234
01:32:12,166 --> 01:32:13,166
Hold still.

1235
01:32:17,875 --> 01:32:19,958
Even your dad hated this house.

1236
01:32:22,041 --> 01:32:24,208
This isn't some
magical place, honey.

1237
01:32:24,291 --> 01:32:26,250
It's just all we could afford.

1238
01:32:32,666 --> 01:32:34,125
Be still.

1239
01:32:36,583 --> 01:32:38,166
Okay, that one's done.

1240
01:32:41,666 --> 01:32:42,666
If we don't...

1241
01:32:44,625 --> 01:32:48,083
If we don't do this right now,
we're gonna lose the house.

1242
01:32:48,625 --> 01:32:49,666
Okay?

1243
01:32:50,375 --> 01:32:53,750
-So I'm begging you.
-Sweetheart, I'm not... I'm too tired.

1244
01:32:53,833 --> 01:32:56,208
-I'm not having this conversation.
-I'm begging you.

1245
01:32:56,291 --> 01:32:59,833
-We're both tired, okay?
-Lynette, I know you don't wanna hear it.

1246
01:32:59,916 --> 01:33:03,041
But I don't want that loan,
and I don't want this house.

1247
01:33:03,666 --> 01:33:05,583
-Don't.
-Please, I'm begging you.

1248
01:33:06,125 --> 01:33:09,333
-I hate this house. I'd like to burn it.
-I'm begging you. Please.

1249
01:33:10,833 --> 01:33:12,500
That's what I would do.

1250
01:33:13,666 --> 01:33:15,041
Too many memories.

1251
01:33:16,750 --> 01:33:19,583
You were never serious
about buying it, were you?

1252
01:33:21,916 --> 01:33:24,083
This entire time,
you've watched me...

1253
01:33:24,708 --> 01:33:25,917
You've watched me...

1254
01:33:28,833 --> 01:33:31,000
You watched me do what
I do and what I did,

1255
01:33:31,083 --> 01:33:33,083
and you still, you said nothing.

1256
01:33:33,833 --> 01:33:35,667
I tried to tell you.
You wouldn't hear.

1257
01:33:35,750 --> 01:33:38,208
No, you didn't. You bought
a car instead of telling me.

1258
01:33:38,291 --> 01:33:41,083
Because I can't have you
screaming and freaking out at me.

1259
01:33:41,166 --> 01:33:43,333
I'm not! What do
you mean, screaming?

1260
01:33:43,416 --> 01:33:46,083
I'm not that person anymore.
I'm not that person.

1261
01:33:46,166 --> 01:33:47,583
I don't do that anymore.

1262
01:33:47,666 --> 01:33:50,417
-You know what? I'm...
-I don't do that. I'm not...

1263
01:33:50,500 --> 01:33:53,375
I'm picking glass out
of your back right now.

1264
01:34:01,208 --> 01:34:03,916
You just don't want to live
with me, that's what it is.

1265
01:34:07,500 --> 01:34:09,833
You don't want to
live with me, do you?

1266
01:34:13,458 --> 01:34:14,500
Oh, Jesus.

1267
01:34:15,541 --> 01:34:16,625
You don't.

1268
01:34:18,291 --> 01:34:19,500
You...

1269
01:34:20,625 --> 01:34:22,542
Okay. Okay, you know what?

1270
01:34:22,625 --> 01:34:24,000
You know what? It's fine.

1271
01:34:24,083 --> 01:34:26,833
Get some shitty
apartment. You go do that.

1272
01:34:26,916 --> 01:34:29,208
-Kenny's gonna come with me.
-Kenny's not gonna go.

1273
01:34:29,291 --> 01:34:31,500
-He's afraid of you.
-Yes, he is. Kenny loves me.

1274
01:34:31,583 --> 01:34:33,667
Of course he loves you,
but he's scared of you.

1275
01:34:33,750 --> 01:34:36,792
Kenny needs me. He knows that I
would never do anything to hurt him.

1276
01:34:36,875 --> 01:34:40,375
Is that right? So where'd
you take him tonight?

1277
01:34:45,500 --> 01:34:47,208
I am his mother, Lynette.

1278
01:34:48,083 --> 01:34:52,125
I have been taking care of Kenny his
entire life since before you were born.

1279
01:34:53,500 --> 01:34:55,417
Well, you know what? I
will fight you for him.

1280
01:34:58,000 --> 01:34:59,875
Is that a joke? Are you kidding?

1281
01:34:59,958 --> 01:35:03,250
And what are you gonna say?
That you tried to kill yourself?

1282
01:35:03,750 --> 01:35:05,750
That you sleep
with men for money?

1283
01:35:06,708 --> 01:35:09,833
You... You become violent,
that you can't hold down a job?

1284
01:35:09,916 --> 01:35:13,375
You would fucking love that,
wouldn't you? You'd love it.

1285
01:35:14,208 --> 01:35:16,625
You'd tell them you have
a fucked-up daughter.

1286
01:35:16,708 --> 01:35:20,333
You know, you forgot
all about Kenny

1287
01:35:20,416 --> 01:35:22,917
when you ran away and
moved in with Tommy.

1288
01:35:23,000 --> 01:35:26,250
And I was fine being his mom then,
right? You were happy about it then.

1289
01:35:26,333 --> 01:35:27,917
Don't you dare! I was just...

1290
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:31,042
I was 16! I was trying to be with
someone who actually loved me.

1291
01:35:31,125 --> 01:35:34,167
-How did that work out for you?
-It didn't work out because I couldn't...

1292
01:35:34,250 --> 01:35:36,166
I couldn't...

1293
01:35:37,500 --> 01:35:39,666
I didn't... I don't...

1294
01:35:49,875 --> 01:35:53,375
You don't think... You
don't think I know...

1295
01:36:00,416 --> 01:36:02,416
You don't think I know who I am?

1296
01:36:04,125 --> 01:36:05,833
You have no clue.

1297
01:36:16,708 --> 01:36:18,166
Where were you?

1298
01:36:22,500 --> 01:36:23,625
Where were you?

1299
01:36:26,750 --> 01:36:28,583
I needed you when he...

1300
01:36:33,500 --> 01:36:34,791
I needed you to...

1301
01:36:36,875 --> 01:36:38,625
I just needed my mom.

1302
01:36:43,250 --> 01:36:44,791
I can't save you.

1303
01:36:45,875 --> 01:36:48,417
I can't help you, so...

1304
01:36:48,500 --> 01:36:49,583
Shit.

1305
01:36:53,333 --> 01:36:56,166
You can keep blaming me, but
you're a grown woman now.

1306
01:36:57,458 --> 01:36:59,667
You want to blame me? Go ahead.

1307
01:37:04,708 --> 01:37:07,292
You're like that thing at
the bottom of a toilet bowl.

1308
01:37:07,375 --> 01:37:10,083
You just, like, suck
everything down with you.

1309
01:37:16,791 --> 01:37:18,625
I can't do this anymore.

1310
01:37:20,625 --> 01:37:24,125
I made plans with Mona. Kenny
and I move in there next week.

1311
01:37:31,166 --> 01:37:32,166
Yeah.

1312
01:38:53,666 --> 01:38:55,417
<i>Hey, Lynette. It's David.</i>

1313
01:38:55,500 --> 01:38:57,625
<i>I am so sorry.</i>

1314
01:38:57,708 --> 01:38:59,250
<i>I've changed my mind.</i>

1315
01:38:59,333 --> 01:39:01,833
<i>I've taken the higher
offer from the other buyer.</i>

1316
01:39:01,916 --> 01:39:03,708
<i>I gave your family
all the chan...</i>

1317
01:40:27,750 --> 01:40:29,791
-Hey.
-Hi.

1318
01:40:32,250 --> 01:40:34,541
Kenny, I have to go
away for a while.

1319
01:40:36,208 --> 01:40:40,333
I'm gonna come back and visit you
as soon as I can, okay? I promise.

1320
01:40:47,666 --> 01:40:49,958
I love you.

1321
01:40:50,041 --> 01:40:51,875
I really love you.

1322
01:40:53,875 --> 01:40:58,708
I'm gonna think about you every second.
Gonna love you every minute of every day.

1323
01:40:58,791 --> 01:40:59,791
Okay?

1324
01:41:03,875 --> 01:41:07,375
You are my little sister.

1325
01:41:07,875 --> 01:41:11,416
And I will always
be your big brother.

1326
01:41:11,916 --> 01:41:15,375
-Yeah.
-And I will always protect you.

1327
01:41:15,875 --> 01:41:17,083
Yes, you will.

1328
01:41:19,208 --> 01:41:20,208
Okay.

1329
01:41:20,958 --> 01:41:22,875
I'm gonna have to go to bed now.

1330
01:41:23,583 --> 01:41:25,000
You have to go to bed?

1331
01:41:25,750 --> 01:41:28,375
-I have to go to bed.
-Okay.

1332
01:42:13,416 --> 01:42:14,416
<i>Mom.</i>

1333
01:42:15,166 --> 01:42:17,291
<i>You asked me what
I did last night.</i>

1334
01:42:21,625 --> 01:42:22,875
<i>I fought.</i>

1335
01:42:24,458 --> 01:42:26,166
<i>I fought for this family.</i>

1336
01:42:27,208 --> 01:42:29,083
<i>The only way I know how.</i>

1337
01:42:33,375 --> 01:42:36,000
<i>But I guess you said
what I needed to hear.</i>

1338
