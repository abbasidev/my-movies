1
00:01:43,841 --> 00:01:48,429
- How was your day?
- It was a bit cold.

2
00:01:48,596 --> 00:01:54,226
- How did Frankie do?
- Frankie was tremendous.

3
00:01:54,393 --> 00:01:57,062
Are you hungry?

4
00:01:58,355 --> 00:02:01,525
I won't give you too much.

5
00:02:09,325 --> 00:02:15,331
Bless us, Lord, for these thy gifts
which we are about to receive...

6
00:02:19,501 --> 00:02:23,005
No!

7
00:02:28,385 --> 00:02:32,473
<i>A gunman broke into a house
in a remote coastal area -</i>

8
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:37,770
<i>- and shot to death a man believed
to be a Republican sympathizer.</i>

9
00:02:37,937 --> 00:02:45,236
<i>It is the latest of many killings
since the peace talks broke down.</i>

10
00:03:54,388 --> 00:03:57,933
Here's your target. Frankie Maguire.

11
00:03:58,100 --> 00:04:02,354
<i>He's responsible for the deaths
of 11 regular Army lads -</i>

12
00:04:02,521 --> 00:04:08,193
- 7 RUC officers and
uncounted numbers of loyalist paras.

13
00:04:09,486 --> 00:04:14,867
He's never seen a jail cell.
I'd like to change that.

14
00:05:11,799 --> 00:05:14,885
This is it. Lads.

15
00:05:15,052 --> 00:05:18,013
Mind how you go.

16
00:05:48,877 --> 00:05:51,755
Stand by.

17
00:06:36,550 --> 00:06:38,677
Move it!

18
00:07:04,078 --> 00:07:08,791
- Seanie?
- I'm fine. Half the Army's here.

19
00:07:16,340 --> 00:07:20,094
Bloody English!

20
00:07:25,349 --> 00:07:27,768
Keep your heads down.

21
00:07:48,539 --> 00:07:51,375
Seanie!

22
00:08:04,013 --> 00:08:07,474
I'm fucked. Frank.

23
00:08:11,645 --> 00:08:17,443
- Frankie, let's get out of here.
- Go on.

24
00:08:20,279 --> 00:08:25,242
- We have to go now.
- Go!

25
00:09:59,044 --> 00:10:02,298
Desmond.

26
00:10:02,464 --> 00:10:05,551
Where's Frankie Maguire?

27
00:10:07,970 --> 00:10:11,098
Up your fucking arse.

28
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:25,404
<i>In a routine security operation,
soldiers looking for an IRA gunman -</i>

29
00:10:25,571 --> 00:10:29,700
<i>- found themselves
in an unexpected firefight.</i>

30
00:10:29,867 --> 00:10:33,996
<i>The IRA denounced the attack as
an unlawful and murderous operation.</i>

31
00:10:34,163 --> 00:10:40,169
<i>The Army put full rrsponsibility
on the IRA.</i>

32
00:10:40,336 --> 00:10:44,256
<i>Both sides said
they're still searching for peace.</i>

33
00:10:44,423 --> 00:10:50,262
<i>But the violence casts further
doubts on future peace initiatives.</i>

34
00:11:07,196 --> 00:11:09,823
Frankie?

35
00:11:24,588 --> 00:11:27,758
It's Martin.

36
00:11:32,304 --> 00:11:38,227
- For fuck's sake. Frankie.
- You had me shaking there.

37
00:11:38,394 --> 00:11:41,647
How are you doing?

38
00:11:41,814 --> 00:11:44,400
Grand.

39
00:11:49,405 --> 00:11:53,534
- Are you hungry?
- Cheers.

40
00:11:53,701 --> 00:11:59,832
A present from the lads.
They send their best.

41
00:12:02,918 --> 00:12:05,004
Good to see you.

42
00:12:05,170 --> 00:12:10,134
- You're looking well.
- Fuck you, you cunt.

43
00:12:13,387 --> 00:12:18,642
There was a big turnout for
Dessie's funeral. Which was good.

44
00:12:22,938 --> 00:12:29,111
The cabinet was talking peace.
The SAS was waiting to take us out.

45
00:12:29,278 --> 00:12:31,906
A setup.

46
00:12:32,072 --> 00:12:37,369
- One of our own?
- We still don't know who.

47
00:12:37,536 --> 00:12:43,083
The Northern Ireland Office
are spouting the same old shite.

48
00:12:45,544 --> 00:12:50,549
They say the word peace,
but all they want is surrender.

49
00:13:32,299 --> 00:13:35,636
Those fucking things...!

50
00:13:37,513 --> 00:13:42,559
If we could take them out.
They'd have to listen.

51
00:13:42,726 --> 00:13:44,895
Right.

52
00:13:46,146 --> 00:13:54,154
Stinger missiles. Then they'll talk
peace... but it's gonna need you.

53
00:14:57,343 --> 00:15:02,014
- You're a judge, are you?
- State Court.

54
00:15:02,181 --> 00:15:07,728
I don't know too many judges...
socially speaking.

55
00:15:13,025 --> 00:15:20,074
We'd raise more money if people
understood what goes on over there.

56
00:15:20,241 --> 00:15:26,789
They say if you're not confused,
you don't know what's going on.

57
00:15:31,961 --> 00:15:35,297
That's it. Isn't it?

58
00:15:38,634 --> 00:15:41,971
It's fantastic.

59
00:16:00,656 --> 00:16:07,913
- Home sweet home.
- We'll need the money quickly.

60
00:16:09,039 --> 00:16:13,377
This is the construction company
where you work.

61
00:16:13,544 --> 00:16:17,881
- You're a friend of the family.
- Are they connected?

62
00:16:18,048 --> 00:16:23,137
Not in the least.
Tom O'Meara served under my father.

63
00:16:23,304 --> 00:16:26,098
- In the Army?
- Police.

64
00:16:26,265 --> 00:16:31,645
- A cop?
- Safest place in the city.

65
00:17:16,106 --> 00:17:18,651
Daddy!

66
00:17:29,662 --> 00:17:36,835
- Mr. O'Meara?
- Tom. Come on in. That's Annie.

67
00:17:37,002 --> 00:17:43,050
How was your trip?
It's a long one, isn't it?

68
00:17:43,217 --> 00:17:45,761
This is Morgie.

69
00:17:45,928 --> 00:17:49,932
Morgan...

70
00:17:50,099 --> 00:17:55,604
Say hi to Rory.
Sheila's in here.

71
00:17:56,689 --> 00:18:01,068
- Sheila, Rory's here.
- Hi. I'm the mother.

72
00:18:01,235 --> 00:18:06,991
- Nice to meet you.
- Bridget's on the phone.

73
00:18:07,157 --> 00:18:12,037
The kids were supposed
to get this crap out of the hallway.

74
00:18:12,204 --> 00:18:17,960
It's not much.
But it's dry and it's warm.

75
00:18:18,127 --> 00:18:24,008
The bed's over here.
There's a bath and shower here.

76
00:18:25,384 --> 00:18:29,013
You've got to jiggle this.
It runs.

77
00:18:29,179 --> 00:18:33,601
- Did Fitz find you a job?
- I start in couple of days.

78
00:18:33,767 --> 00:18:40,190
- The TV's here. What are you doing?
- On a building site.

79
00:18:40,357 --> 00:18:47,698
- If there's anything you need...
- No, thanks for putting me up.

80
00:18:47,865 --> 00:18:52,912
- Don't thank us. Thank Fitz.
- Dinner.

81
00:18:53,078 --> 00:18:58,584
Besides, it's good to have somebody
around here that pees standing up.

82
00:19:30,824 --> 00:19:33,869
For food and clothes -

83
00:19:34,036 --> 00:19:37,915
- for family, too,
dear God, thank you...

84
00:19:38,082 --> 00:19:44,755
I hope Rory likes his basement,
because I don't.

85
00:19:44,922 --> 00:19:49,843
- I like the basement a lot.
- Pass the vegetables.

86
00:19:50,010 --> 00:19:52,846
May I serve you?

87
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:57,351
Say when.

88
00:19:57,518 --> 00:20:04,358
- That looks delicious. What is it?
- It's corned beef and cabbage.

89
00:20:05,442 --> 00:20:11,907
- Don't you have that in Ireland?
- I've never had it.

90
00:20:12,074 --> 00:20:16,203
- But you have this over there?
- We do have that.

91
00:20:16,370 --> 00:20:19,123
In fact I was baptized in it.

92
00:20:19,290 --> 00:20:23,961
- You were baptized in beer?
- That's a joke, honey.

93
00:20:24,128 --> 00:20:29,758
- Have some more vegetables.
- Eat your dinner.

94
00:20:29,925 --> 00:20:35,806
- Why do you always pick on me?
- Pass the mustard.

95
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:43,230
- What part of Ireland are you from?
- Cookstown. In the north.

96
00:20:43,397 --> 00:20:46,150
On the shore of Lough Neagh.

97
00:20:46,317 --> 00:20:51,363
- Do you have a girlfriend there?
- Come on, guys.

98
00:20:51,530 --> 00:20:56,619
- That's a personal question.
- Leave the guy alone.

99
00:20:56,785 --> 00:21:01,457
- Bridget has a boyfriend.
- Will you guys knock it off?

100
00:21:02,499 --> 00:21:07,671
- Rory, welcome to America.
- Thanks.

101
00:21:07,838 --> 00:21:14,595
Sector David. 2746. 13:30 meal.
Diaz, you're with me again.

102
00:21:14,762 --> 00:21:17,097
Others, same as yesterday.

103
00:21:18,140 --> 00:21:21,518
- Everybody's laughing at me.
- Why?

104
00:21:21,685 --> 00:21:27,983
I'm supposed to drive the car.
You're supposed to sit next to me.

105
00:21:28,150 --> 00:21:31,070
You've got the stripes.

106
00:21:31,237 --> 00:21:36,825
The guy who rides with the sergeant
is the chauffeur.

107
00:21:36,992 --> 00:21:42,248
- So, when am I gonna drive?
- I don't know. Tomorrow.

108
00:21:42,414 --> 00:21:44,959
You've said that for three years!

109
00:22:01,767 --> 00:22:07,439
- What's the time, goldilocks?
- That's my sister, you bastard.

110
00:22:07,606 --> 00:22:12,069
- Frankie!
- It's Rory now, you cunt.

111
00:22:12,236 --> 00:22:16,115
- What's that?
- It's a high five. This is the USA.

112
00:22:16,282 --> 00:22:20,578
- Look at the state of you.
- It's called style.

113
00:22:20,744 --> 00:22:24,957
- Calvin Klein.
- Circus clown. Look at that one.

114
00:22:25,124 --> 00:22:29,712
- Sorry! He did it.
- I didn't.

115
00:22:29,878 --> 00:22:33,257
Look at us two Fenian bastards!

116
00:22:48,439 --> 00:22:52,735
- Jesus Christ. Mind the car.
- That's yours?

117
00:22:52,902 --> 00:22:59,116
She's a beaut. Isn't she?
Bought and nearly paid for.

118
00:22:59,283 --> 00:23:02,202
Fuck, I left the door open!

119
00:23:02,369 --> 00:23:07,082
Frankie, are we gonna
go through with this?

120
00:23:12,463 --> 00:23:18,844
I've got a foot pursuit.
Northbound. Male black.

121
00:23:19,011 --> 00:23:23,015
Sarge! The car's blocked.

122
00:23:23,182 --> 00:23:26,936
This is 35 Sergeant.
205 and Post.

123
00:23:28,938 --> 00:23:32,775
Heading westbound toward the park.

124
00:23:32,942 --> 00:23:36,362
Stop!

125
00:23:36,528 --> 00:23:39,782
Towards the park.

126
00:23:39,949 --> 00:23:44,745
Move! Damn!

127
00:23:50,084 --> 00:23:52,419
Wait.

128
00:24:01,595 --> 00:24:05,099
35 Sergeant.
They're going through the park.

129
00:24:05,266 --> 00:24:08,435
<i>That's a copy, 35 Sergeant.</i>

130
00:24:13,107 --> 00:24:16,902
You're gonna be sorry.

131
00:24:18,571 --> 00:24:23,200
- Don't lose him.
- I'm on him.

132
00:24:29,748 --> 00:24:34,003
God damn it! Come here.
Let me see your hands.

133
00:24:34,169 --> 00:24:37,506
He's my collar.

134
00:24:39,383 --> 00:24:44,930
Don't run away from the police.
You'll get yourself shot that way.

135
00:24:45,097 --> 00:24:47,433
What have you got?

136
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:52,187
He robbed this.
I saw him put it in his pocket.

137
00:24:56,692 --> 00:25:00,321
- You witnessed it?
- Yeah.

138
00:25:01,572 --> 00:25:05,951
- How old are you, son?
- 15. sir.

139
00:25:06,118 --> 00:25:09,413
Stand him up.

140
00:25:09,580 --> 00:25:13,584
That's old enough to know
not to run away from the police.

141
00:25:13,751 --> 00:25:16,295
What's your story?

142
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:25,262
I was too embarrassed to bring
the condoms to the cash register.

143
00:25:32,311 --> 00:25:37,524
Turn him around.
Stand still.

144
00:25:38,901 --> 00:25:42,154
Turn around. Give me your hand.

145
00:25:42,321 --> 00:25:46,533
- I'll never do this again.
- Take a hike.

146
00:25:49,245 --> 00:25:53,123
Why don't you cuff the rookie?

147
00:25:58,712 --> 00:26:04,260
Here it is.
The Irish Republican Navy.

148
00:26:10,683 --> 00:26:12,893
What do you think?

149
00:26:17,481 --> 00:26:23,696
The pitch is off.
It'll give us a half a knot.

150
00:26:27,366 --> 00:26:32,121
For fuck's sake!
It's pissing antifreeze.

151
00:26:32,288 --> 00:26:36,959
- I knew it.
- Pull it.

152
00:26:38,377 --> 00:26:42,548
We've got the prop work,
the caulking and the pipes, -

153
00:26:42,715 --> 00:26:47,928
- the transducer, the bilge pump,
and timing the engine out.

154
00:26:48,095 --> 00:26:53,601
A dozen 55-gallon drums of fuel.
Why don't we Fed-Ex the gear home?

155
00:26:54,518 --> 00:27:00,566
The two of us crossing the Atlantic
with a hold full of missiles...

156
00:27:00,733 --> 00:27:06,572
- It's crazy.
- Aye, it's fucking mad.

157
00:27:08,949 --> 00:27:13,329
When I get my pension,
you know what I'm gonna do?

158
00:27:13,495 --> 00:27:19,251
- What are you gonna do?
- I'm gonna raise pot-bellied pigs.

159
00:27:19,418 --> 00:27:26,008
I saw it on TV.
This guy was making a fortune.

160
00:27:26,175 --> 00:27:28,594
Pigs?

161
00:27:28,761 --> 00:27:31,055
Hi, girls.

162
00:27:31,221 --> 00:27:37,394
- Last week it was a bakery.
- I could never get up that early.

163
00:27:37,561 --> 00:27:41,774
<i>We have a 1052
at 42 West 135th Street.</i>

164
00:27:41,941 --> 00:27:46,987
<i>Female called to say
her husband's getting violent.</i>

165
00:27:54,078 --> 00:27:57,414
Police.

166
00:27:57,581 --> 00:28:00,584
<i>Police, open up.</i>

167
00:28:00,751 --> 00:28:03,712
Police, open the door.

168
00:28:06,507 --> 00:28:10,469
- Hi, has Mummy called the police?
- Yes.

169
00:28:11,929 --> 00:28:14,848
Mummy...

170
00:28:16,892 --> 00:28:23,315
<i>- You whore, come here!
- Put that gun down, man.</i>

171
00:28:23,482 --> 00:28:28,904
<i>- No!
- Let's talk to her.</i>

172
00:28:29,071 --> 00:28:31,282
<i>No!</i>

173
00:28:32,116 --> 00:28:38,289
<i>- I'm going to talk to her.
- Let's talk about it.</i>

174
00:28:53,304 --> 00:28:55,681
Take it easy.

175
00:28:55,848 --> 00:29:00,519
Fucking guns, man.

176
00:29:32,635 --> 00:29:37,097
- The john's downstairs.
- I'm collecting for Irish Relief.

177
00:29:37,264 --> 00:29:40,434
Eddie.

178
00:29:43,062 --> 00:29:45,981
Irish Relief?

179
00:29:46,148 --> 00:29:50,611
- Billy Burke.
- Rory Devaney. Martin sent me.

180
00:29:50,778 --> 00:29:53,530
He's a good man.

181
00:29:53,697 --> 00:29:59,328
- How do you like America?
- Fine, the land of opportunity.

182
00:29:59,495 --> 00:30:04,083
14 years old, I was sleeping
in the back of a saloon.

183
00:30:04,250 --> 00:30:08,504
- Today I've got three of my own.
- You've done well.

184
00:30:08,671 --> 00:30:11,840
I've done well with you lads, too.
Drink?

185
00:30:12,007 --> 00:30:14,510
Sit down.

186
00:30:16,178 --> 00:30:22,226
- When can we take possession?
- These ain't egg rolls.

187
00:30:22,393 --> 00:30:26,814
Stingers jacked the Russians
out of Afghanistan. It'll take time.

188
00:30:26,981 --> 00:30:31,569
- How much time?
- 6- 8 weeks.

189
00:30:33,529 --> 00:30:38,200
- Can I put you up?
- I'm sorted out. Thanks.

190
00:30:38,367 --> 00:30:41,870
- Where are you staying?
- Across the river.

191
00:30:42,037 --> 00:30:47,501
- Where? Brooklyn?
- Something like that.

192
00:30:47,668 --> 00:30:53,382
- How do I get in touch with you?
- Ask for Sean.

193
00:30:53,549 --> 00:30:57,428
This is a Manhattan number.

194
00:30:57,595 --> 00:31:03,267
- About the money...
- Get the gear, it's no problem.

195
00:31:04,310 --> 00:31:07,563
Cheers.

196
00:31:09,523 --> 00:31:12,318
Rory...

197
00:31:12,484 --> 00:31:16,864
Are you Belfast boys
all born such hard-ons?

198
00:31:21,785 --> 00:31:24,747
Are you asleep, honey.

199
00:31:25,956 --> 00:31:30,753
- You faker.
- I'm not tired.

200
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:36,508
I'll give you a mummy tuck.
Where's ducky?

201
00:31:36,675 --> 00:31:39,428
He's a sleepy ducky.

202
00:31:44,058 --> 00:31:48,646
It's kind of funny seeing my sister
getting all worked up.

203
00:31:48,812 --> 00:31:54,610
He is cute. But it's not like
she'd have a chance.

204
00:31:54,777 --> 00:31:58,405
- Get off the phone.
- Wait a minute.

205
00:31:58,572 --> 00:32:02,493
- How long have you been talking?
- Not that long.

206
00:32:02,660 --> 00:32:05,579
- Who is it?
- A friend.

207
00:32:05,746 --> 00:32:09,291
- Three minutes.
- Five minutes, please?

208
00:32:09,458 --> 00:32:14,046
You have to press D-I-R. Return.

209
00:32:14,213 --> 00:32:18,300
- What did you just press?
- DIR.

210
00:32:18,467 --> 00:32:23,138
And then enter.
What does CLS do?

211
00:32:23,305 --> 00:32:25,933
No. Don't do it.

212
00:32:26,100 --> 00:32:29,603
We're out of milk.

213
00:32:29,770 --> 00:32:33,399
I don't want to close it.

214
00:32:43,492 --> 00:32:46,579
I'm going to get some milk.

215
00:32:47,538 --> 00:32:53,836
You want to take a little walk?
I'll buy you a beer. It's not far.

216
00:32:56,880 --> 00:33:02,219
It's very peaceful here. Quiet.

217
00:33:03,429 --> 00:33:07,766
- Do you know your neighbours?
- Yeah. Most of them.

218
00:33:07,933 --> 00:33:13,522
- Do you like 'em?
- We get along pretty well.

219
00:33:13,689 --> 00:33:16,692
What's it like over there?

220
00:33:16,859 --> 00:33:21,697
It's violent. People are fed up.

221
00:33:21,864 --> 00:33:28,245
- Doesn't seem to be a point to it.
- It depends where you stand.

222
00:33:29,538 --> 00:33:33,042
I just try to keep out of it.

223
00:33:33,918 --> 00:33:41,258
- These houses are fantastic.
- They're pretty old, around 1900.

224
00:33:41,425 --> 00:33:43,969
Our new ones are older than that.

225
00:33:48,474 --> 00:33:52,144
- Tony.
- Hey, O'Meara.

226
00:33:52,311 --> 00:33:57,566
- This is Rory Devaney.
- Another friggin' mick.

227
00:33:57,733 --> 00:34:01,070
I'm an immigration agent.

228
00:34:01,237 --> 00:34:06,700
He runs a pet shop down the street.
He's the Prince of the Poodles.

229
00:34:06,867 --> 00:34:13,666
Those are fighting words.
You know what this is?

230
00:34:13,832 --> 00:34:18,587
- That's an Italian love muscle.
- That's why it's in your hand.

231
00:34:18,754 --> 00:34:22,174
Let's find out
what you can do with one of these.

232
00:34:22,341 --> 00:34:28,430
You and the sergeant. Me and Joey.
Italians versus Irish.

233
00:34:32,351 --> 00:34:35,980
Throw the milk in the cooler, Joey.

234
00:34:46,490 --> 00:34:48,826
Lovely.

235
00:34:51,120 --> 00:34:55,708
- You're a wonderful man.
- Unbelievable. Isn't he?

236
00:35:08,512 --> 00:35:12,182
I don't know if I can shoot.

237
00:35:12,349 --> 00:35:16,478
You hear about the Irish guy
who tried to blow up a car?

238
00:35:16,645 --> 00:35:21,483
He burnt his lips on the tailpipe.

239
00:35:22,192 --> 00:35:24,445
Scratch.

240
00:35:26,405 --> 00:35:31,160
- That'll be mine.
- You're up, Irish.

241
00:35:44,506 --> 00:35:49,511
- What is this?
- The luck of the Irish.

242
00:35:56,018 --> 00:35:59,563
Let me check your green card.

243
00:36:18,123 --> 00:36:20,751
There you go.

244
00:36:20,918 --> 00:36:26,966
- Have you got money? Clean hanky?
- I'll see you for dinner.

245
00:36:55,869 --> 00:37:00,833
- Leave it out.
- Take that, you Fenian bastard.

246
00:37:02,209 --> 00:37:06,130
- Come on.
- I'll get you back.

247
00:37:08,257 --> 00:37:10,342
No surrender.

248
00:37:40,664 --> 00:37:45,294
Burke called.
He wants to talk to you.

249
00:37:45,461 --> 00:37:50,049
Everything's set up for next week.
He needs the money.

250
00:38:03,646 --> 00:38:06,232
One. Two. Three.

251
00:38:06,398 --> 00:38:09,276
Snip, snip, snip...

252
00:38:11,612 --> 00:38:15,991
- A delivery for Mr. Fitzsimmons.
- I'll take that.

253
00:38:16,158 --> 00:38:19,078
Do you need me to sign for it?

254
00:38:20,871 --> 00:38:24,208
No... that's fine.

255
00:39:03,247 --> 00:39:08,877
Isn't it lovely, the way they glide
like that? Not a care in the world.

256
00:39:10,379 --> 00:39:13,340
Are you from Belfast?

257
00:39:14,425 --> 00:39:17,595
You don't know who I am?

258
00:39:18,721 --> 00:39:24,852
- I'm Michael's sister. Megan.
- Michael Doherty?

259
00:39:28,939 --> 00:39:35,195
- How's your mother?
- Bad. Since they killed Michael.

260
00:39:41,201 --> 00:39:46,457
- Will I be off then?
- I best be getting on with it.

261
00:39:46,624 --> 00:39:52,338
- Watch yourself, Frankie.
- You as well love.

262
00:39:52,504 --> 00:39:57,676
What I wouldn't have given for that
when I was 13.

263
00:40:37,925 --> 00:40:41,804
Rory, Mom said dinner's ready.

264
00:40:47,142 --> 00:40:53,399
- That's a lovely dress.
- It's for Morgan's confirmation.

265
00:40:57,236 --> 00:41:00,239
- Are you married?
- No.

266
00:41:00,406 --> 00:41:05,869
- Will you marry me?
- I'll have to ask your da.

267
00:41:07,997 --> 00:41:11,667
What are you doing in there?
I need a shower.

268
00:41:11,834 --> 00:41:16,422
- Wake up, lazybones.
- Sheila!

269
00:41:21,010 --> 00:41:24,597
- Get out!
- It's my confirmation today.

270
00:41:24,763 --> 00:41:29,852
You're not going to look any better.
You might as well give up.

271
00:41:30,019 --> 00:41:34,982
Mom, Morgan just gave me the finger.
Tell her not to do that.

272
00:41:35,149 --> 00:41:38,736
She has to get out of the bathroom.
She only listens to you.

273
00:41:38,903 --> 00:41:41,572
Oh. No! Dad!

274
00:41:41,739 --> 00:41:45,409
There's something wrong
with this family.

275
00:41:58,589 --> 00:42:04,345
In the name of the Father. The Son
and the Holy Spirit. Amen.

276
00:42:08,849 --> 00:42:11,727
You have already been baptized.

277
00:42:11,894 --> 00:42:18,859
You will now receive
the power of the Lord's spirit.

278
00:42:19,026 --> 00:42:22,279
You must be witnesses
before the world -

279
00:42:22,446 --> 00:42:27,159
- to his death, his suffering,
his resurrection.

280
00:42:27,326 --> 00:42:33,290
Your life must at all times
reflect the goodness of Christ.

281
00:42:33,457 --> 00:42:39,421
Now that you've come of age, I ask
that you renew your baptismal vows.

282
00:42:41,257 --> 00:42:44,134
- Do you renounce Satan?
- I do.

283
00:42:44,301 --> 00:42:48,264
- All his earthly works?
- I do.

284
00:42:48,430 --> 00:42:52,393
- His empty promises?
- I do.

285
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:57,064
Do you believe in
the Holy Catholic Church?

286
00:42:57,231 --> 00:43:02,695
The forgiveness of sins,
and the resurrection of the body?

287
00:43:02,861 --> 00:43:05,739
- I do.
- Amen.

288
00:43:08,325 --> 00:43:12,663
- Hi. Aunt Birdie.
- He said hello.

289
00:43:14,707 --> 00:43:20,588
- Rory, this is my friend Brooke.
- Hi, nice to meet you.

290
00:43:22,423 --> 00:43:25,759
Stop it!

291
00:43:29,263 --> 00:43:33,017
I'll be back in a second.

292
00:43:33,183 --> 00:43:37,479
- You acted like such a dork.
- I did not.

293
00:43:48,574 --> 00:43:53,162
Coming through. Hot plate. Lasagne.

294
00:43:53,329 --> 00:43:57,875
Is the corkscrew there?

295
00:43:58,042 --> 00:44:04,131
You must be the faithful sidekick.
I live beneath the stairs.

296
00:44:04,298 --> 00:44:07,968
- Don't I look Irish to you?
- Eddie, how are you?

297
00:44:08,135 --> 00:44:11,639
I'm gonna have a pop.

298
00:44:11,805 --> 00:44:14,475
Come here.

299
00:44:17,895 --> 00:44:19,980
I love these guys.

300
00:45:18,706 --> 00:45:21,542
Telephone.

301
00:45:21,709 --> 00:45:25,713
In the kitchen.

302
00:45:27,965 --> 00:45:32,428
<i>- Hello.
- Martin's dead. They got him.</i>

303
00:45:32,595 --> 00:45:38,058
<i>We don't know how much they know.
You can't go through with this.</i>

304
00:45:40,936 --> 00:45:43,022
This way.

305
00:45:43,188 --> 00:45:49,028
The Cloisters is a series
of monasteries transported here...

306
00:45:51,113 --> 00:45:54,408
- Where's the judge?
- He's scared.

307
00:45:54,575 --> 00:45:57,912
He think's they're on to him, too.

308
00:45:58,078 --> 00:46:02,374
- He says he wants no part of it.
- And the money?

309
00:46:02,541 --> 00:46:07,755
He said to hold on to it
until you hear word from Belfast.

310
00:46:14,303 --> 00:46:17,348
<i>Is that it? is it finished?</i>

311
00:46:18,891 --> 00:46:21,977
By no means is it finished.

312
00:46:23,771 --> 00:46:27,942
- I'll have to go to Belfast.
- You can't show your face there.

313
00:46:29,151 --> 00:46:31,862
I won't show my face.

314
00:46:33,572 --> 00:46:38,911
Tell me who to see and what to say.
I'll go.

315
00:46:59,056 --> 00:47:04,687
Given the particular situation,
we're going to have to postpone.

316
00:47:04,853 --> 00:47:09,775
Make the payment now.
I'll stockpile the stuff for you.

317
00:47:09,942 --> 00:47:16,282
I can't do that. I'm to sit tight
till things get worked out at home.

318
00:47:17,074 --> 00:47:19,994
Hey, Mike.

319
00:47:21,495 --> 00:47:27,543
I'm sorry about Martin, but these
are not soda cans you asked me for.

320
00:47:27,710 --> 00:47:33,340
These are no deposit, no return
items, and I'm out of pocket.

321
00:47:33,507 --> 00:47:38,888
- You're putting me in a tight spot.
- That's the way it has to be.

322
00:47:43,434 --> 00:47:48,647
- If that's the way it has to be...
- It's the way it has to be.

323
00:47:59,783 --> 00:48:04,496
I have to fly to Dublin,
and visit my mother in Belfast.

324
00:48:05,831 --> 00:48:09,793
I tell them the three ports
that you might come in at.

325
00:48:09,960 --> 00:48:15,216
That's it. Lovely.
There you have it.

326
00:48:16,634 --> 00:48:18,969
Grand.

327
00:48:22,306 --> 00:48:26,518
But it isn't just a message.

328
00:48:26,685 --> 00:48:29,730
I mean like...

329
00:48:29,897 --> 00:48:34,985
...do you ever
feel guilty about it?

330
00:48:40,115 --> 00:48:43,244
Of course there's guilt.

331
00:48:44,912 --> 00:48:50,125
I have sleepless nights
about some things.

332
00:48:54,380 --> 00:48:57,841
No one's innocent.

333
00:49:00,970 --> 00:49:04,515
Everyone has their ghosts.

334
00:49:12,481 --> 00:49:16,026
- Are you all right?
- Aye...

335
00:49:16,193 --> 00:49:18,737
Are you sure?

336
00:50:25,137 --> 00:50:27,681
Paddy!

337
00:50:29,058 --> 00:50:34,897
Beautiful! All you need now
is a house, kids and a dog.

338
00:50:41,070 --> 00:50:43,864
Look at this.

339
00:50:45,157 --> 00:50:49,620
Wait till I get around.
Take the radio.

340
00:50:49,787 --> 00:50:54,208
35 sergeant.
We've got a 1032 in progress.

341
00:51:15,604 --> 00:51:17,856
He's got a gun!

342
00:51:18,023 --> 00:51:21,610
Police! Freeze!

343
00:51:23,112 --> 00:51:26,782
- Are you all right?
- Yeah, I got the fucker!

344
00:51:26,949 --> 00:51:30,911
Stop, damn it!

345
00:51:34,415 --> 00:51:37,334
Toss it!

346
00:51:37,501 --> 00:51:41,297
Don't make me shoot you.

347
00:51:43,215 --> 00:51:45,175
Asshole!

348
00:51:54,476 --> 00:51:57,271
Eddie!

349
00:51:57,438 --> 00:52:00,774
Are you okay?

350
00:52:09,325 --> 00:52:13,245
He was getting away.

351
00:52:24,089 --> 00:52:27,885
He's dead. Man.
Half his face is gone.

352
00:52:28,052 --> 00:52:31,847
- What happened?
- He was getting away.

353
00:52:32,014 --> 00:52:36,977
- He turned with a gun in his hand.
- You shot him in the back.

354
00:52:37,144 --> 00:52:42,816
Here's his gun.
He tossed it around the corner.

355
00:53:10,010 --> 00:53:14,765
He shot at us, Tommy!
He shot at us!

356
00:53:19,395 --> 00:53:22,356
Thanks. Ted.

357
00:53:22,523 --> 00:53:25,693
- You did good, Tom.
- Grand jury?

358
00:53:25,859 --> 00:53:30,406
- Yeah. Have you talked to Sheila?
- I'll wait till I get home.

359
00:53:30,573 --> 00:53:34,910
- You want a lift?
- No, I'm okay.

360
00:53:36,287 --> 00:53:42,167
- You're Diaz, right?
- Yeah. That mutt shot at me...

361
00:53:42,334 --> 00:53:46,505
- Is this your PBA rep?
- Yes. He is.

362
00:53:46,672 --> 00:53:52,052
Didn't he tell you you don't have
to make a statement for 48 hours?

363
00:53:52,219 --> 00:53:56,515
- Yes. He did.
- Take his advice. Tommy.

364
00:54:03,480 --> 00:54:07,610
- How did it go in there?
- Fine.

365
00:54:07,776 --> 00:54:11,780
What does that mean. Fine?

366
00:54:11,947 --> 00:54:14,867
You shot him in the back.

367
00:54:15,034 --> 00:54:20,039
- He was running away.
- He shot at us!

368
00:54:21,832 --> 00:54:25,669
We're in the police business,
not the revenge business.

369
00:54:28,172 --> 00:54:31,717
Did you cover for me?

370
00:54:39,183 --> 00:54:44,313
I'm fine. I just had a few drinks.
I didn't want to drive.

371
00:54:46,899 --> 00:54:52,446
He's here now.
We'll be a half hour or so. Okay.

372
00:55:19,765 --> 00:55:22,935
Are you all right there, Tommy?

373
00:55:27,940 --> 00:55:33,320
There was a shooting today.
Eddie killed a guy.

374
00:55:34,405 --> 00:55:41,078
- Killed the bad guy?
- Not that bad. I saw his sheet.

375
00:55:41,245 --> 00:55:44,915
A couple of punk things, but...

376
00:55:50,713 --> 00:55:53,799
Poor Eddie.

377
00:56:00,890 --> 00:56:04,643
Pull over.
I'm gonna be sick.

378
00:56:36,300 --> 00:56:40,471
- Are you okay then?
- Just give me a minute.

379
00:56:40,638 --> 00:56:43,849
You've got "The Exorcist" here.

380
00:56:44,725 --> 00:56:48,395
New York's finest.

381
00:56:48,562 --> 00:56:52,608
- Sorry...
- It's all right.

382
00:56:53,567 --> 00:56:56,946
Can I ask you something?

383
00:56:57,112 --> 00:57:01,075
Have you ever shot anyone?

384
00:57:04,745 --> 00:57:08,832
No, I've never shot anyone.

385
00:57:08,999 --> 00:57:12,586
I've fired my gun four times
on the street.

386
00:57:13,546 --> 00:57:16,590
Four times in 23 years.

387
00:57:18,008 --> 00:57:23,305
If you pick up a gun, sooner
or later someone gets a bullet.

388
00:57:26,725 --> 00:57:31,939
- Big boys' rules.
- And what do you know about that?

389
00:57:33,315 --> 00:57:36,735
Common knowledge, I suppose.

390
00:57:38,862 --> 00:57:42,116
Did you ever shoot anybody?

391
00:57:50,332 --> 00:57:55,880
When I was eight, this man came
into the house and killed my da.

392
00:57:58,799 --> 00:58:02,469
He killed my da in front of us.

393
00:58:25,326 --> 00:58:27,953
Let's go, please.

394
00:59:29,348 --> 00:59:32,893
I'm sorry about your dad.

395
00:59:46,323 --> 00:59:51,370
- Did they get the fuckers?
- They are the fuckers.

396
00:59:51,537 --> 00:59:54,707
Don't look for happy endings, Tom.

397
00:59:54,873 --> 00:59:58,377
It's not an American story.

398
00:59:58,544 --> 01:00:01,672
It's an Irish one.

399
01:00:32,077 --> 01:00:34,747
What is it?

400
01:00:34,914 --> 01:00:40,336
Lopez didn't have a gun in his hand
when he was shot. He tossed it.

401
01:00:40,502 --> 01:00:46,383
Eddie didn't see him toss it.
I had the gun when Eddie shot him.

402
01:00:47,509 --> 01:00:51,138
It was a bad call.

403
01:00:51,305 --> 01:00:55,601
- You covered for him.
- I lied about how it went down.

404
01:00:59,563 --> 01:01:02,816
I've thought it through.

405
01:01:03,859 --> 01:01:08,113
I'm going to take my pension.
Retire.

406
01:01:10,991 --> 01:01:17,831
In 23 years you never took a bribe.
You never abused your power.

407
01:01:17,998 --> 01:01:21,669
- You treat everyone fairly.
- Not the dead guy.

408
01:01:21,835 --> 01:01:25,881
- He shot at you!
- He was stealing radios.

409
01:01:26,048 --> 01:01:30,386
- He didn't deserve to be killed.
- It's terrible.

410
01:01:30,553 --> 01:01:36,267
But cops make mistakes. Besides,
it was Eddie who made the mistake.

411
01:01:36,433 --> 01:01:40,229
I lied! Don't you understand?

412
01:01:43,274 --> 01:01:48,362
- I said I'd never do that.
- You did it once. Tom.

413
01:01:48,529 --> 01:01:55,286
What about next time?
I can't do the job this way.

414
01:01:55,452 --> 01:02:02,459
- I'm done with being a cop.
- But you love being a cop.

415
01:02:02,626 --> 01:02:07,506
I love you. I love the kids.
I love what we've got.

416
01:02:07,673 --> 01:02:13,345
I don't love being a cop...
anymore.

417
01:02:19,727 --> 01:02:23,314
I never told you this...

418
01:02:24,356 --> 01:02:30,863
I was the only Irish girl in town
who didn't want to marry a cop.

419
01:02:45,878 --> 01:02:49,423
I don't want to go back to work.

420
01:02:58,807 --> 01:03:02,728
The kids won't be home
for two hours.

421
01:03:02,895 --> 01:03:06,649
Hell. I'm retired...

422
01:03:48,732 --> 01:03:51,610
Tom!

423
01:03:53,612 --> 01:03:56,282
Sheila!

424
01:04:00,744 --> 01:04:05,416
Officer needs help.
We're at 87 Cornelia Avenue.

425
01:04:08,919 --> 01:04:12,131
They're armed.

426
01:04:15,634 --> 01:04:18,512
87 Cornelia Avenue.

427
01:04:22,808 --> 01:04:24,894
Sheila!

428
01:04:27,396 --> 01:04:30,316
Get out!

429
01:05:11,941 --> 01:05:15,778
- Get off of him. Man.
- Tom...

430
01:05:15,945 --> 01:05:18,364
Get up. Now!

431
01:05:18,530 --> 01:05:24,203
- Easy, man.
- Get up there against the wall.

432
01:05:24,370 --> 01:05:29,833
- What do you want?
- Shut your mouth, man!

433
01:05:30,584 --> 01:05:37,925
If they get here, it gets
complicated. Walk away now.

434
01:05:38,092 --> 01:05:41,178
Damn it!

435
01:05:42,179 --> 01:05:46,976
Get out of here. Man.
Let 'em go.

436
01:05:47,142 --> 01:05:50,854
- Sheila...
- Stay right where you are.

437
01:05:51,021 --> 01:05:55,109
Don't you fucking move!

438
01:05:59,154 --> 01:06:01,991
Sheila...

439
01:06:10,291 --> 01:06:15,129
- Let 'em go.
- I'm not going.

440
01:06:15,296 --> 01:06:18,674
They're leaving.

441
01:06:18,841 --> 01:06:22,428
It's okay. Nobody got hurt.

442
01:06:26,807 --> 01:06:30,102
Are you all right?

443
01:06:31,770 --> 01:06:34,773
Jesus. Man.

444
01:06:48,787 --> 01:06:52,625
About 240. 6'4" or so.

445
01:06:52,791 --> 01:06:56,629
The other one was medium.
All white guys.

446
01:06:56,795 --> 01:07:00,341
- Wearing masks?
- Yeah.

447
01:08:09,618 --> 01:08:13,372
What do you think you're doing?

448
01:08:20,421 --> 01:08:23,173
Get him out of here.

449
01:08:30,347 --> 01:08:33,225
You're a stupid man, Mr. Burke.

450
01:08:34,351 --> 01:08:38,731
You're only seeing me
standing between you and the money.

451
01:08:38,898 --> 01:08:44,945
You're forgetting the thousand
other men standing behind me.

452
01:08:45,112 --> 01:08:48,073
That's a mistake.

453
01:08:50,159 --> 01:08:52,369
Are you with me there, love?

454
01:08:59,376 --> 01:09:01,921
Rory...

455
01:09:02,963 --> 01:09:07,009
You might want to talk to Sean
about this.

456
01:09:07,176 --> 01:09:13,349
- Maybe I'll give him a call.
- You could if he was home.

457
01:09:13,515 --> 01:09:16,727
But he's not home.

458
01:09:16,894 --> 01:09:23,442
Do you want to see him?
I know he wants to see you.

459
01:09:24,652 --> 01:09:28,447
My pearls are still there,
and the cash wallet.

460
01:09:28,614 --> 01:09:34,453
The TV, the VCR, the computer.
Nothing's missing.

461
01:09:34,620 --> 01:09:40,417
- Call me from your sister's.
- Yeah.

462
01:09:40,584 --> 01:09:43,921
You got a rain check.

463
01:09:48,342 --> 01:09:51,637
I owe you one.

464
01:09:54,890 --> 01:09:58,227
I'll have the girls call tonight.

465
01:11:36,158 --> 01:11:38,285
Go get the money.

466
01:11:38,452 --> 01:11:42,581
There's a warehouse
at 12th and Hudson.

467
01:11:42,748 --> 01:11:48,003
Please. Don't fuck around.
Or I'll kill your friend.

468
01:11:50,214 --> 01:11:52,716
Stupid man.

469
01:12:55,988 --> 01:12:58,324
Jesus!

470
01:13:18,510 --> 01:13:21,805
I'll explain when you get here.

471
01:13:22,848 --> 01:13:26,560
I need you, Eddie.

472
01:14:01,387 --> 01:14:03,597
Who are you?

473
01:14:05,599 --> 01:14:09,562
Did you bring this into my house?

474
01:14:13,315 --> 01:14:18,779
- Aye.
- Where have you just been?

475
01:14:22,575 --> 01:14:28,122
I went to make sure
it wouldn't happen again.

476
01:14:29,999 --> 01:14:34,295
It was all lies. wasn't it?
Everything you told us.

477
01:14:37,006 --> 01:14:42,052
Except for how I feel about you
and your family. That wasn't a lie.

478
01:14:44,471 --> 01:14:49,101
I'm sorry.
I never meant for this to happen.

479
01:14:49,268 --> 01:14:51,812
I just...

480
01:14:53,272 --> 01:14:58,569
I don't have time to explain.
I'll get my gear and I'll clear out.

481
01:15:01,906 --> 01:15:05,326
What's the money for?

482
01:15:05,492 --> 01:15:09,914
I was thinking guns.
I was thinking IRA.

483
01:15:11,916 --> 01:15:16,587
- I need that money, Tom!
- Why?

484
01:15:17,421 --> 01:15:22,092
So other eight-year-olds can
watch their fathers be gunned down?

485
01:15:25,095 --> 01:15:29,934
If this money leaves here,
more people will die.

486
01:15:30,100 --> 01:15:33,646
Can you tell me that won't happen?

487
01:15:36,357 --> 01:15:41,779
What if tonight everything you
had was burned down around you?

488
01:15:43,072 --> 01:15:48,244
What if you and yours walked out
on the street and were spat on?

489
01:15:48,410 --> 01:15:51,622
Told you were nothing. No good.

490
01:15:56,418 --> 01:16:02,049
What if it was one of yours
cut down by a plastic bullet?

491
01:16:08,847 --> 01:16:13,018
Would you just sit back
and say, "Oh well... "

492
01:16:18,899 --> 01:16:22,111
"Remember Annie. She was sweet. "

493
01:16:24,446 --> 01:16:27,616
"God bless her. "

494
01:16:34,123 --> 01:16:39,295
You've got to try and
make some sense out of all of it.

495
01:16:41,297 --> 01:16:44,425
You look around and you realize -

496
01:16:44,592 --> 01:16:49,638
- you're dealing with a government
that's fooled everyone.

497
01:16:52,600 --> 01:16:55,352
All sides.

498
01:16:56,770 --> 01:17:01,567
Normal people in a normal situation
find it disgusting.

499
01:17:01,734 --> 01:17:07,281
But you can't understand it
because you haven't lived it.

500
01:17:08,490 --> 01:17:12,161
I'm sorry
it's going badly between us.

501
01:17:14,788 --> 01:17:18,250
You're a good man.

502
01:17:18,417 --> 01:17:22,213
But understand, I have to go!

503
01:17:23,881 --> 01:17:30,221
I'm also a cop,
and I can't let you go.

504
01:17:30,387 --> 01:17:33,349
I'm going, Tom.

505
01:17:34,725 --> 01:17:37,394
Tommy?

506
01:17:39,188 --> 01:17:42,566
Come on. Eddie. Cuff him.

507
01:18:00,960 --> 01:18:04,463
You drive.

508
01:19:21,207 --> 01:19:24,168
Jesus. look at this.

509
01:19:27,838 --> 01:19:31,050
It's the trash thing.

510
01:19:46,941 --> 01:19:52,571
I'm a police officer.
You have to move this vehicle.

511
01:20:05,834 --> 01:20:09,338
- I can't do it.
- Move the truck.

512
01:20:16,595 --> 01:20:20,015
You move it!

513
01:20:35,948 --> 01:20:39,368
Move. Move. Move!

514
01:20:41,412 --> 01:20:44,665
Don't!

515
01:21:41,805 --> 01:21:44,975
- What kind of animal is this?
- A bear.

516
01:21:45,142 --> 01:21:47,811
What kind of noise does a bear make?

517
01:21:53,651 --> 01:21:57,863
- What kind of animal is this?
- An owl.

518
01:21:58,030 --> 01:22:01,367
What kind of noise does an owl make?

519
01:22:02,368 --> 01:22:07,289
- When do owls come out?
- In the night-time.

520
01:22:13,379 --> 01:22:15,464
Something terrible has happened.

521
01:22:47,162 --> 01:22:50,040
Tommy.

522
01:22:50,916 --> 01:22:54,962
There's some people here to see you.
FBI.

523
01:23:02,177 --> 01:23:08,434
- This is Sergeant O'Meara.
- Stanley and Fisher. FBI.

524
01:23:08,601 --> 01:23:14,315
We'd like to ask you about your
association with Frankie Maguire.

525
01:23:14,481 --> 01:23:20,696
- Who's Frankie Maguire?
- Francis Austin Maguire.

526
01:23:20,863 --> 01:23:25,826
Born July 27, 1964.
Belfast. Northern Ireland.

527
01:23:25,993 --> 01:23:29,413
From December 1985
he was a unit commander.

528
01:23:29,580 --> 01:23:35,794
Falls Road Active Service Unit.
Belfast Brigade, IRA.

529
01:23:36,754 --> 01:23:41,800
Wanted for the crime of murder.
13 British soldiers.

530
01:23:42,843 --> 01:23:46,472
11 police officers.

531
01:23:46,639 --> 01:23:50,142
One thing I'm not clear about...

532
01:23:50,309 --> 01:23:55,439
What is your relationship
to this terrorist?

533
01:24:01,570 --> 01:24:07,493
- Who are you?
- Harry Sloan, British Intelligence.

534
01:24:07,660 --> 01:24:12,206
- You are Irish...
- So is Cardinal O'Connor.

535
01:24:15,125 --> 01:24:21,090
I've been tracking these bastards
for two years. He's the last one.

536
01:24:21,257 --> 01:24:24,134
A month ago
he came to New York.

537
01:24:24,885 --> 01:24:30,849
I have the authority
to use any means necessary -

538
01:24:31,016 --> 01:24:34,395
to bring closure to this issue.

539
01:24:41,235 --> 01:24:44,863
You want to talk to me again...

540
01:24:45,030 --> 01:24:48,200
...you read me my rights.

541
01:24:54,206 --> 01:24:57,918
Cooperate with these people.

542
01:24:59,295 --> 01:25:02,715
Don't piss your career away
over this.

543
01:25:06,844 --> 01:25:09,597
They're not gonna bring him in.

544
01:25:11,098 --> 01:25:13,976
They're gonna kill him.

545
01:26:48,696 --> 01:26:51,949
The money, the missiles.

546
01:26:55,244 --> 01:26:58,372
Where's Sean?

547
01:27:01,375 --> 01:27:04,753
I have to see him.

548
01:27:04,920 --> 01:27:10,593
Do you think you're gonna fuck
with me, you bog-Irish hick!

549
01:27:10,759 --> 01:27:14,221
Fuck with me?

550
01:27:15,931 --> 01:27:18,434
I think not.

551
01:27:19,560 --> 01:27:22,771
You're on your own here, laddie.

552
01:27:22,938 --> 01:27:26,483
You know it... I know it...

553
01:27:28,444 --> 01:27:33,365
...and I guarantee you
Sean knows it.

554
01:27:33,532 --> 01:27:36,118
Get him.

555
01:27:51,175 --> 01:27:54,303
Give us the money.

556
01:29:14,300 --> 01:29:17,887
You're a stupid man, Mr. Burke.

557
01:29:30,900 --> 01:29:33,569
Sweet dreams.

558
01:29:56,342 --> 01:29:59,053
Frankie!

559
01:30:06,769 --> 01:30:10,773
My mind's been racing,
but I've got a plan.

560
01:30:10,940 --> 01:30:17,279
My sister lives with her husband in
San Francisco. They'll sort you out.

561
01:30:17,446 --> 01:30:20,574
- There's no sorting me out.
- There is.

562
01:30:20,741 --> 01:30:24,370
- I killed a cop.
- That's why you've got to go there.

563
01:30:24,537 --> 01:30:27,540
I leave tonight.

564
01:30:27,706 --> 01:30:33,337
- I'm going back home.
- We've got enough martyrs.

565
01:30:34,171 --> 01:30:38,968
I'll ram that boat up their arse.
You have to tell them I'm coming.

566
01:30:39,134 --> 01:30:45,224
You don't have to give it up.
Just lie low for a while.

567
01:30:45,391 --> 01:30:50,312
If you want to fight,
you have to stay alive.

568
01:30:50,479 --> 01:30:53,440
Sean's dead.

569
01:30:57,027 --> 01:30:59,655
I leave tonight.

570
01:31:08,414 --> 01:31:12,751
Is the boss in? Police business.

571
01:31:32,855 --> 01:31:37,526
- Tom, how are you?
- Not so good.

572
01:31:37,693 --> 01:31:44,200
- I had no idea. I tried to call.
- I was at the hospital with Eddie.

573
01:31:44,366 --> 01:31:47,494
I'm so sorry about Eddie.

574
01:31:50,206 --> 01:31:54,168
I sponsor dozens of these kids.
I should've checked his background.

575
01:31:54,335 --> 01:31:57,463
I just can't put it together.

576
01:31:58,547 --> 01:32:02,801
What's it for? The money?

577
01:32:02,968 --> 01:32:09,183
- What was all that money for?
- What are you talking about?

578
01:32:09,350 --> 01:32:16,190
I'm racking my brain. The only
thing I can think of is guns.

579
01:32:16,357 --> 01:32:20,236
Like the one
my wife had jammed in her face.

580
01:32:20,402 --> 01:32:23,489
Guys with guns came to my house.

581
01:32:24,490 --> 01:32:27,618
Did you know that?

582
01:32:32,373 --> 01:32:36,126
Why don't you go home...

583
01:32:37,962 --> 01:32:41,131
Get some rest.

584
01:32:42,299 --> 01:32:45,302
I'm sorry, Peter...

585
01:32:48,013 --> 01:32:51,976
I will go home. I'm tired.

586
01:33:01,026 --> 01:33:05,030
As soon as I lock him up.

587
01:33:05,197 --> 01:33:08,909
Do me one more favour. Tell me...

588
01:33:10,953 --> 01:33:15,541
- Where is he?
- I don't know.

589
01:33:18,085 --> 01:33:22,673
Where is he? I'll put your head
right through this fucking wall.

590
01:33:29,513 --> 01:33:32,766
Stop! I just want to talk to you.

591
01:33:32,933 --> 01:33:34,894
Come here.

592
01:33:44,028 --> 01:33:46,655
Open the door!

593
01:33:48,073 --> 01:33:51,493
I just want to talk!

594
01:34:15,643 --> 01:34:20,856
- Where is he?
- He's not here.

595
01:34:29,615 --> 01:34:32,535
Don't you touch him!

596
01:34:58,686 --> 01:35:02,982
- Rory!
- Keep away from me, Tom.

597
01:35:20,833 --> 01:35:26,839
- What's your name?
- Megan Doherty.

598
01:35:28,382 --> 01:35:31,010
He's away, Megan.

599
01:35:40,144 --> 01:35:45,065
I'm Tom O'Meara.
Rory's been staying with us.

600
01:35:46,609 --> 01:35:49,445
Did he tell you?

601
01:36:02,416 --> 01:36:06,962
I understand
why he's doing what he's doing.

602
01:36:07,129 --> 01:36:10,591
If I'd endured what he's endured...

603
01:36:12,176 --> 01:36:17,473
If I'd seen my father gunned down
in front of my family...

604
01:36:17,640 --> 01:36:23,896
...I'd be carrying a gun, too,
but I wouldn't be wearing a badge.

605
01:36:25,981 --> 01:36:30,945
I'm not going to lie to you.
I'm here to bring him in.

606
01:36:33,989 --> 01:36:36,992
He killed a cop.

607
01:36:38,244 --> 01:36:41,372
The FBI is after him.

608
01:36:42,581 --> 01:36:47,962
The guys he was doing
business with here are after him.

609
01:36:48,128 --> 01:36:51,048
There's an SAS agent -

610
01:36:51,215 --> 01:36:56,220
- who has tracked down and killed
every other member of his unit.

611
01:37:01,517 --> 01:37:04,770
He doesn't have to die.

612
01:37:06,272 --> 01:37:11,610
If you want to see him again,
you've got to help me find him.

613
01:37:12,528 --> 01:37:18,117
I promise you I'll do everything
I can to bring him in alive.

614
01:37:58,157 --> 01:38:00,451
Mr. O'Meara!

615
01:41:16,605 --> 01:41:21,360
Hold it! Let me see your hands!

616
01:41:22,695 --> 01:41:27,533
- I've got to bring you in, son.
- I'm not going back.

617
01:41:27,700 --> 01:41:33,706
- The killing's got to stop.
- You'll have to kill to stop it.

618
01:41:33,873 --> 01:41:37,334
It gets a bit complicated,
doesn't it?

619
01:41:37,501 --> 01:41:41,171
Nobody has to get killed.

620
01:41:41,338 --> 01:41:46,760
- Go home to your family, Tom.
- Don't move!

621
01:41:46,927 --> 01:41:49,388
I'm not going back.

622
01:43:28,445 --> 01:43:31,407
I told you. I warned you.

623
01:44:21,165 --> 01:44:25,878
Did I tell you
my da was a fisherman?

624
01:44:36,555 --> 01:44:39,642
He loved the rocking of the sea.

625
01:44:42,519 --> 01:44:47,816
He said there was no more
peaceful way of going to sleep.

626
01:44:58,494 --> 01:45:01,539
You're a good man, Tom.

627
01:45:13,425 --> 01:45:18,556
Hang on, Rory.
I'll get you to shore.

628
01:45:18,722 --> 01:45:23,185
- Hang on, kid.
- I told you...

629
01:45:25,688 --> 01:45:28,899
It's not an American story.

630
01:45:32,319 --> 01:45:35,531
It's an Irish one.

631
01:46:01,432 --> 01:46:05,311
We never had a choice...

632
01:46:07,271 --> 01:46:10,232
...you and I.
