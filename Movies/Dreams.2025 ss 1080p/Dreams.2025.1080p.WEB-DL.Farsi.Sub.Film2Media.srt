00:01:22,624 --> 00:01:25,294
Please, help me!

2
00:01:25,669 --> 00:01:26,920
Help!

3
00:01:28,964 --> 00:01:30,048
Please!

4
00:01:30,132 --> 00:01:31,884
Get me out of here!

5
00:01:34,928 --> 00:01:36,555
Help!

6
00:01:40,893 --> 00:01:41,894
Help!

7
00:01:43,896 --> 00:01:45,606
Get us out of here!

8
00:01:47,191 --> 00:01:48,192
Please!

9
00:01:50,277 --> 00:01:52,112
Oh God!

10
00:02:07,377 --> 00:02:08,377
Water!

11
00:02:11,006 --> 00:02:12,007
Water!

12
00:02:14,551 --> 00:02:16,512
Get out now. Move. Come on, come on.

13
00:02:16,595 --> 00:02:17,971
Come on, hurry.

14
00:02:18,472 --> 00:02:20,599
The backpacks. Move it, fast!

15
00:02:21,767 --> 00:02:23,060
We’re getting out!

16
00:02:23,143 --> 00:02:25,020
- At last! Thank God!
- Quick!

17
00:02:25,103 --> 00:02:26,772
Get up. Get down!

18
00:02:27,814 --> 00:02:29,107
Where’s he going? Where?

19
00:02:29,191 --> 00:02:31,485
- Let’s see what you’ve got. Take it out.
- Come here. Come here.

20
00:02:31,568 --> 00:02:35,197
- Take it out! Give it to me.
- Come on, that’s it.

21
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,406
Go on, get out.

22
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:39,326
- That chain, don’t play dumb.
- Give me the boots.

23
00:02:39,409 --> 00:02:41,912
- Show me what you’ve got.
- I don’t have anything!

24
00:02:41,995 --> 00:02:43,622
- You, bastard, give me that jacket.
- Got your wallet there?

25
00:02:43,705 --> 00:02:46,041
- Don’t play dumb, idiot.
- Come on, come on.

26
00:02:46,124 --> 00:02:48,168
- You too, I saw you.
- Hands up. Let’s go, quick.

27
00:02:48,252 --> 00:02:50,254
Up, up. Let’s go, fast.

28
00:02:50,337 --> 00:02:52,464
- Take them off. What you got?
- You, give me that backpack.

29
00:02:53,298 --> 00:02:56,468
- Give it! Come on, bastards, move!
- Quick, quick!

30
00:04:06,955 --> 00:04:07,956
Is that all?

31
00:04:09,499 --> 00:04:11,919
Want anything else? All good?

32
00:04:12,669 --> 00:04:13,670
Ok.

33
00:04:20,511 --> 00:04:21,512
Ok.

34
00:04:26,642 --> 00:04:27,643
Hey, no!

35
00:04:28,227 --> 00:04:29,811
- I need a glass of water.
- No.

36
00:04:30,229 --> 00:04:31,688
You can’t be here.

37
00:04:32,231 --> 00:04:33,315
Let’s go.

38
00:05:17,192 --> 00:05:19,194
STOP

39
00:06:45,072 --> 00:06:47,199
- Well… thanks.
- Good luck.

40
00:07:03,298 --> 00:07:04,299
Hey.

41
00:07:05,133 --> 00:07:06,426
Would you give me a ride?

42
00:07:06,802 --> 00:07:08,387
I’m going to San Francisco.

43
00:07:09,805 --> 00:07:11,974
I’m headed the other way.

44
00:07:12,349 --> 00:07:13,851
Alright, ok.

45
00:07:46,049 --> 00:07:48,051
STOP

46
00:11:08,418 --> 00:11:09,586
How did you get here?

47
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:14,925
- I crossed through San Antonio.
- How?

48
00:11:16,802 --> 00:11:18,262
With the money you left.

49
00:12:19,698 --> 00:12:22,409
Call your mom, she’s worried.

50
00:12:22,492 --> 00:12:24,244
Yes, but you tell her I’m fine.

51
00:12:24,995 --> 00:12:26,455
- I’ll call later.
- I’ll tell her.

52
00:12:26,538 --> 00:12:28,123
- Ok.
- Thanks.

53
00:12:28,207 --> 00:12:29,791
Alright, hug.

54
00:12:29,875 --> 00:12:31,210
Hugs, take care.

55
00:12:32,711 --> 00:12:34,755
- Your dad?
- Yes.

56
00:12:35,088 --> 00:12:36,882
- How is he?
- He’s fine.

57
00:12:36,965 --> 00:12:38,425
- Hand me the plates.
- Yes.

58
00:12:39,051 --> 00:12:40,385
I’m glad to see you.

59
00:12:42,054 --> 00:12:43,388
You found her.

60
00:12:43,472 --> 00:12:44,681
Yes. Thanks.

61
00:12:48,602 --> 00:12:49,937
What will we eat?

62
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:51,230
Italian food.

63
00:12:55,234 --> 00:12:57,027
- Want me to help?
- No.

64
00:12:58,153 --> 00:13:00,072
I want to spoil you.
I want to spoil you.

65
00:13:01,281 --> 00:13:03,867
- Ok. So what do I do?
- Nothing.

66
00:13:05,702 --> 00:13:08,705
…after crossing the border in Laredo, Mexican authorities reported that,

67
00:13:08,789 --> 00:13:12,167
at 2:45 p.m. on Monday, a truck passed through a checkpoint

68
00:13:12,251 --> 00:13:14,378
of the Border Patrol in Encino, Texas.

69
00:13:14,461 --> 00:13:17,923
A camera recorded the driver, identified by authorities

70
00:13:18,006 --> 00:13:21,426
as a U.S. citizen, driving toward Cotulla.

71
00:13:21,510 --> 00:13:24,847
And finally it stopped about 235 kilometers further ahead,

72
00:13:24,930 --> 00:13:28,141
on a day with temperatures close to 38 degrees Celsius.

73
00:13:28,225 --> 00:13:29,643
The alleged driver was identified

74
00:13:29,726 --> 00:13:32,688
by the U.S. Department of Justice as Homero Zamorano.

75
00:13:32,771 --> 00:13:34,898
- What do you have against Mexicans?
- Nothing...

76
00:13:35,399 --> 00:13:38,652
It’s not, it’s not that I have anything against Mexicans, but I think...

77
00:13:39,111 --> 00:13:42,447
I think we should help Americans. That’s all.

78
00:13:42,865 --> 00:13:45,325
Well, your wife doesn’t seem to care either.

79
00:13:45,409 --> 00:13:49,538
Sure, but she hasn’t attended these meetings in a long time, so it doesn’t matter.

80
00:13:49,621 --> 00:13:54,042
Jake, are the ones living in Mission Mexicans or Americans?

81
00:13:55,043 --> 00:13:56,170
Mexicans.

82
00:13:57,421 --> 00:14:00,883
Son, if you don’t approve your sister’s project,
Son, if you don’t approve your sister’s project,

83
00:14:00,966 --> 00:14:03,677
we can finance it from another company account.

84
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:05,262
I’ll propose something, Jake.

85
00:14:05,345 --> 00:14:08,098
I’ll make a program you do like.

86
00:14:08,182 --> 00:14:11,476
First sign Mexico’s budget for next year.

87
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:16,106
Half the money from my programs is deducted in taxes.

88
00:14:16,190 --> 00:14:17,983
Oh, approved.

89
00:14:19,985 --> 00:14:22,279
Do you want to go with me to Mexico next time?

90
00:14:22,362 --> 00:14:23,572
Don’t exaggerate.

91
00:14:23,947 --> 00:14:25,449
- Thanks.
- You’re welcome.

92
00:14:27,618 --> 00:14:28,911
You’re an idiot.

93
00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:32,122
MISSION DISTRICT COMMUNITY CENTER

94
00:14:32,706 --> 00:14:34,374
RESPECT

95
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:23,609
I missed this.

96
00:16:28,989 --> 00:16:30,490
Let’s do it more often.

97
00:16:55,557 --> 00:16:57,351
Do you have to go back to San Francisco?

98
00:17:00,437 --> 00:17:01,605
Not right away.

99
00:17:03,357 --> 00:17:04,691
What if we stayed?

100
00:17:14,826 --> 00:17:17,371
I’ll see if they can extend our stay.

101
00:17:18,829 --> 00:17:19,830
One day.

102
00:17:20,832 --> 00:17:22,251
One more day.

103
00:17:22,334 --> 00:17:23,335
Ok.

104
00:17:24,252 --> 00:17:25,587
That’s enough.

105
00:17:48,443 --> 00:17:49,444
We’re leaving.

106
00:17:50,737 --> 00:17:51,697
Why?

107
00:17:52,698 --> 00:17:54,533
- No availability?
- No.

108
00:17:55,075 --> 00:17:57,953
One of my dad’s partners is checking in.

109
00:17:59,663 --> 00:18:01,540
Do you fear being seen with me?
Do you fear being seen with me?

110
00:18:04,793 --> 00:18:05,961
That’s not it.

111
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:11,550
Can you pack? Please.

112
00:18:11,633 --> 00:18:13,635
Please, pack.

113
00:18:50,756 --> 00:18:52,424
Miss McCarthy, welcome.

114
00:19:17,866 --> 00:19:20,244
May I have your attention, please?

115
00:19:20,327 --> 00:19:22,913
First of all, welcome to the “Michael McCarthy” wing.

116
00:19:22,996 --> 00:19:27,292
As you know, my father is a tireless defender of the arts

117
00:19:27,376 --> 00:19:31,171
and has donated, from his private collection, the works we can admire here today,

118
00:19:31,255 --> 00:19:33,382
so I invite you to join me in welcoming,

119
00:19:33,465 --> 00:19:35,092
not only a great human being,

120
00:19:35,175 --> 00:19:38,220
but a man who doesn’t seem to stop in his effort to make this

121
00:19:38,303 --> 00:19:39,847
a better city. Michael McCarthy.

122
00:19:44,184 --> 00:19:45,185
Thank you.

123
00:19:46,061 --> 00:19:48,981
First, I want to thank you all for being here today.

124
00:19:49,064 --> 00:19:50,399
It means a lot.

125
00:19:50,983 --> 00:19:53,443
I also want to thank my son Jake,

126
00:19:54,820 --> 00:19:57,781
not only for his kind and generous words,

127
00:19:57,865 --> 00:20:00,868
which are sometimes a bit exaggerated about his father,
which are sometimes a bit exaggerated about his father,

128
00:20:01,451 --> 00:20:03,579
but because he too is a great advocate.

129
00:20:04,663 --> 00:20:08,166
He has created programs that help the most needy in our community,

130
00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:09,710
and I thank him.

131
00:20:10,836 --> 00:20:13,505
And I want to thank my beautiful daughter Jennifer,

132
00:20:13,881 --> 00:20:17,050
who, since she graduated from university, has always been by my side,

133
00:20:17,134 --> 00:20:19,553
helping this foundation run as it should.

134
00:20:23,182 --> 00:20:24,433
Hi, it’s me.

135
00:20:24,808 --> 00:20:27,561
I wanted to tell you I stopped by the house.

136
00:20:27,644 --> 00:20:31,565
I took my things and left the keys on the kitchen table.

137
00:20:32,274 --> 00:20:34,818
I came here to be with you.

138
00:20:34,902 --> 00:20:38,864
You know what you mean to me and what I risked to be here.

139
00:20:39,364 --> 00:20:41,742
But I don’t want to keep hiding all the time.

140
00:20:41,825 --> 00:20:43,076
So, please...

141
00:20:44,411 --> 00:20:45,412
Leave me.

142
00:20:45,913 --> 00:20:47,414
I’ll manage on my own.

143
00:21:16,818 --> 00:21:17,945
Fernando?

144
00:21:22,533 --> 00:21:24,743
Where are you? I’m worried.

145
00:21:27,287 --> 00:21:28,455
What do you want?

146
00:21:28,539 --> 00:21:29,915
Come back.

147
00:21:36,505 --> 00:21:38,048
Where will you sleep?

148
00:21:39,633 --> 00:21:41,343
Maybe I’ll go back to Mexico.

149
00:21:41,802 --> 00:21:42,970
Don’t call me.

150
00:21:53,564 --> 00:21:55,816
This one has a new entrance.

151
00:21:58,986 --> 00:22:02,155
We’d have to modify the façade and request new permits.
We’d have to modify the façade and request new permits.

152
00:22:05,534 --> 00:22:07,995
Do you want me to show you the budgets?

153
00:22:11,415 --> 00:22:13,876
I’ll review it later. We’ll talk then.

154
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:15,961
Of course.

155
00:22:20,132 --> 00:22:22,843

157
00:22:42,029 --> 00:22:44,990
Your call was sent to voicemail. Leave your message...

159
00:22:48,243 --> 00:22:49,369
Very good.

- Are we doing well?
- Happy anniversary!

161
00:22:51,246 --> 00:22:52,247
Yes.

162
00:22:53,081 --> 00:22:54,499
What are we toasting to?

163
00:22:56,919 --> 00:22:59,087
Better you do it.

164
00:23:02,591 --> 00:23:04,593
First me in English and then you in Spanish.

165
00:23:04,676 --> 00:23:05,761
Alright.

166
00:23:06,762 --> 00:23:09,932
- To another six months...
- Only six months?

167
00:23:23,153 --> 00:23:24,488
Hello, Jake.

168
00:23:24,571 --> 00:23:26,490
Hello. Hello, hello. How are you?

169
00:23:26,573 --> 00:23:27,824
Fine, what’s up?

170
00:23:28,534 --> 00:23:32,996
Tomorrow we’ll have a barbecue in the garden.

171
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:36,166
The kids want to see you and spend time...

172
00:23:36,250 --> 00:23:37,334
Will Dad go?

173
00:23:38,043 --> 00:23:39,044
Yes.

174
00:23:40,546 --> 00:23:43,006
Sorry to miss it, I’m going to Mexico City.

175
00:23:44,049 --> 00:23:46,552
You’re going to Mexico City? When?

176
00:23:46,635 --> 00:23:49,471
I’m on the plane, I’ll visit the academy.

177
00:23:50,931 --> 00:23:52,558
The... the academy?

178
00:23:52,641 --> 00:23:53,642
Yes.

179
00:23:54,059 --> 00:23:55,561
What do you mean you’ll visit it?

180
00:23:55,644 --> 00:23:57,813
Well, they’re doing a great job...

181
00:23:57,896 --> 00:24:00,774
So why go, if they’re already doing a good job?
So why go, if they’re already doing a good job?

182
00:24:00,858 --> 00:24:01,859
Jake.

183
00:24:01,942 --> 00:24:04,361
I’m joking, just joking. Take care, ok?

184
00:24:04,444 --> 00:24:06,613
- I will. I’ll be back Tuesday.
- I worry about you.

185
00:24:06,697 --> 00:24:08,198
- Ah, I… I’m fine.
- Call me when you’re back, alright?

186
00:24:08,282 --> 00:24:10,617
- Ok. Love you all. Have fun.
- Ok. We love you.

187
00:24:10,701 --> 00:24:12,119
- Bye.
- Good, thanks. Bye.

188
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:00,143
You're going to sit on the table...
You're going to sit on the table...

189
00:26:00,978 --> 00:26:03,897
and I'm going to suck your balls without touching your penis.

190
00:26:05,816 --> 00:26:07,693
And no matter how hard you are...

191
00:26:08,443 --> 00:26:09,778
we won't fuck.

192
00:26:13,073 --> 00:26:14,449
Let's see how long you can last.

193
00:26:16,660 --> 00:26:18,203
Do you think you know me well?

194
00:26:20,747 --> 00:26:22,165
I know you're wet.

195
00:26:22,875 --> 00:26:24,293
Your nipples are hard.

196
00:26:25,669 --> 00:26:28,505
And all you want is for me to turn you over

197
00:26:28,589 --> 00:26:29,882
and spank your ass.

198
00:26:29,965 --> 00:26:31,383
That'll shut you up.

199
00:26:32,718 --> 00:26:34,595
I'll take my penis and stick it in you...

200
00:26:35,888 --> 00:26:37,264
while I kiss your neck.

201
00:26:39,224 --> 00:26:40,809
Is that what you think I'm thinking?

202
00:26:41,852 --> 00:26:44,897
And you want me to stick my finger up your ass at the same time.

203
00:26:48,192 --> 00:26:49,943
You don't know me well.

204
00:26:52,112 --> 00:26:55,073
But I know you get hard talking to me.

205
00:26:56,700 --> 00:26:59,369
And you're dying for me to suck your balls.

206
00:27:00,787 --> 00:27:02,998
And come in your face, just like yesterday.

207
00:27:05,375 --> 00:27:07,127
Why don't we go to the couch?

208
00:27:07,669 --> 00:27:10,047
I'm going to lick you while you suck my balls.

209
00:27:12,299 --> 00:27:14,885
To the couch? Why so far away?

210
00:27:17,221 --> 00:27:18,555
Suck them.

211
00:27:23,268 --> 00:27:25,521
Even though you’re sweaty from exercise?

212
00:27:27,523 --> 00:27:29,441
I think that’s how you like them.

213
00:27:31,860 --> 00:27:32,903
Really?

214
00:28:02,516 --> 00:28:04,309
Wait for me there.

215
00:28:10,899 --> 00:28:14,278
Fernando called us and said he was safe in San Francisco.

216
00:28:14,611 --> 00:28:15,779
Leave him alone.

217
00:28:26,039 --> 00:28:31,170
I told Fernando not to leave Mexico and that what he did was very dangerous.

218
00:28:34,882 --> 00:28:39,553
I told Fernando not to leave Mexico and that what he did is very dangerous.

219
00:28:39,636 --> 00:28:42,222
Yes, but the one who humiliated him at the hotel was her.

220
00:28:42,973 --> 00:28:44,558
Better just tell him to go.

221
00:28:45,058 --> 00:28:47,686
And also tell him why not find someone his own age.

222
00:29:07,956 --> 00:29:09,124
Beautiful.

223
00:29:09,208 --> 00:29:10,209
Thank you.

224
00:29:10,292 --> 00:29:11,293
Thank you.

225
00:29:11,376 --> 00:29:14,254
Well, I ask you all to stand up too.

226
00:29:14,338 --> 00:29:16,048
Please come closer.

227
00:29:16,131 --> 00:29:20,302
Many of you already know our dear Jennifer McCarthy,

228
00:29:20,385 --> 00:29:22,846
director of the foundation that supports us.

229
00:29:23,931 --> 00:29:24,973
- Hello.
- Welcome.

230
00:29:25,057 --> 00:29:26,058
Thank you.

231
00:29:26,141 --> 00:29:29,603
Thank you. I’m sorry I don’t speak Spanish to tell you how wonderful you are,

232
00:29:29,686 --> 00:29:31,772
but maybe you could translate it.

233
00:29:31,855 --> 00:29:34,316
Thank you. She’s very happy to be here.

234
00:29:34,399 --> 00:29:37,653
And she’s seen a lot of progress since the last time she joined us.

235
00:29:37,736 --> 00:29:40,197
Sorry I didn’t come earlier.

236
00:29:43,867 --> 00:29:45,619
Thank you very much for coming.

237
00:29:45,702 --> 00:29:46,870
Where is Fernando?

238
00:29:48,038 --> 00:29:49,915
He hasn’t been here in weeks.

239
00:29:50,707 --> 00:29:52,459
Thank you for receiving me.

240
00:29:53,502 --> 00:29:55,087
Let me know if you hear anything about him.

241
00:30:26,493 --> 00:30:27,536
Martha?

242
00:30:28,579 --> 00:30:31,582
There are clothes for you in the closet. That, give it to your family.

243
00:30:31,665 --> 00:30:33,208
- The rest, keep it.
- Thanks.

244
00:30:33,292 --> 00:30:36,670
Ok? On the corner. When Fernando returns, will you call me?

245
00:30:38,714 --> 00:30:39,798
One moment.

246
00:30:40,340 --> 00:30:41,425
One moment...

247
00:30:43,427 --> 00:30:47,389
When Fernando returns, call me immediately.

248
00:30:50,726 --> 00:30:53,020
Ah. “When Fernando gets home, call me immediately.”

249
00:30:53,103 --> 00:30:54,396
- Of course, ma’am.
- Ok. Yes?

250
00:30:54,479 --> 00:30:55,772
- Yes.
- Ok, thank you.

251
00:30:55,856 --> 00:30:58,150
Would you like something to eat?

252
00:30:58,233 --> 00:30:59,651
No, no thank you.

253
00:31:00,277 --> 00:31:01,278
- Thanks.
- Goodbye.

254
00:31:01,361 --> 00:31:02,362
Bye.

255
00:31:21,131 --> 00:31:22,549
This is how it looks.

256
00:31:33,185 --> 00:31:34,770
I’ll be very clear.

257
00:31:35,604 --> 00:31:38,273
It’s almost impossible to find an illegal because...

258
00:31:38,357 --> 00:31:39,775
they’re not in the records.

259
00:31:39,858 --> 00:31:42,569
I’ll send you the information... Do what you can.

260
00:31:43,487 --> 00:31:46,490
- I don’t want to give you false hope.
- Money is not a problem.

261
00:31:47,658 --> 00:31:48,617
Ok.

262
00:31:50,327 --> 00:31:53,121
Could you tell me a little about your relationship?

263
00:31:55,499 --> 00:31:56,667
He’s a dancer...

264
00:31:56,750 --> 00:31:58,877
He works at my foundation in Mexico City.

265
00:32:08,178 --> 00:32:09,555
- Welcome.
- Thank you.

266
00:32:11,056 --> 00:32:12,057
Hello.

267
00:32:36,707 --> 00:32:38,083
Ready to go in?

268
00:32:38,166 --> 00:32:39,168
Yes.

269
00:32:46,300 --> 00:32:48,635
Incredible. What’s your name?

270
00:32:49,386 --> 00:32:50,596
My name is Fernando.

271
00:32:50,679 --> 00:32:52,181
- Where are you from?
- Thanks.

272
00:32:52,598 --> 00:32:54,224
I’m from Mexico. Thanks.

273
00:32:54,683 --> 00:32:57,019
Mexico. I’m trying to get a ticket for the ballet.

274
00:32:58,437 --> 00:33:00,606
I’m going to the bathroom, won’t be long.
I’m going to the bathroom, won’t be long.

275
00:33:00,689 --> 00:33:02,024
- Hurry up.
- Yes.

276
00:33:07,863 --> 00:33:08,864
Hello.

277
00:33:41,522 --> 00:33:42,523
Fernando.

278
00:34:44,543 --> 00:34:46,587
- Hello, Mary.
- Hello.

279
00:34:46,670 --> 00:34:49,214
- I came to see Mathew.
- Fine, I’ll let him know you’re here.

280
00:34:49,297 --> 00:34:50,549
- Thanks.
- You’re welcome.

281
00:34:50,632 --> 00:34:52,259
- What a pretty blouse.
- Thanks.

282
00:34:52,842 --> 00:34:56,013
- Did you like last night’s performance?
- Oh my God! It was horrible.

283
00:34:56,096 --> 00:34:57,556
Please tell me you hated it.

284
00:34:57,639 --> 00:35:00,225
- Oh, I hated it. My father liked it.
- Of course he did.

285
00:35:00,726 --> 00:35:03,187
I saw you outside. I wanted to greet you, but...

286
00:35:03,270 --> 00:35:05,272
you were talking with a dancer in the street.

287
00:35:05,355 --> 00:35:08,275
- I preferred not to interrupt.
- Oh, he’s so talented.

288
00:35:08,358 --> 00:35:11,612
- He works in a motel or something.
- In a motel?

289
00:35:11,695 --> 00:35:13,947
Yes, he’s from Mexico. You could help him.

290
00:35:15,157 --> 00:35:16,158
Sure.

291
00:35:16,700 --> 00:35:19,745
Why don’t you send me his information? I’ll see if the foundation can help.

292
00:35:19,828 --> 00:35:21,914
That would be fantastic. How are you?

293
00:35:21,997 --> 00:35:24,499
- Very well.
- How’s your project going?

294
00:35:24,583 --> 00:35:25,667
Good.

295
00:35:26,668 --> 00:35:28,879
I came to talk to you about a building

296
00:35:28,962 --> 00:35:31,006
we’re remodeling in the Mission District.

297
00:35:31,089 --> 00:35:32,216
How exciting!

298
00:35:32,299 --> 00:35:33,967
- I’ll show you some photos.
- Ok.

299
00:36:47,749 --> 00:36:49,668
Did your parents tell you I went to see them?

300
00:36:51,044 --> 00:36:52,045
No.

301
00:36:54,423 --> 00:36:55,757
How did you find me?

302
00:36:56,133 --> 00:36:57,926
I saw when Matthew gave you his card.

303
00:36:59,386 --> 00:37:00,387
You know him.
You know him.

304
00:37:02,097 --> 00:37:03,932
He’ll let me train with the company.

305
00:37:07,644 --> 00:37:09,813
- Will you stay?
- Yes.

306
00:37:11,356 --> 00:37:13,817
- How do you make money?
- Don’t you see?

307
00:37:14,568 --> 00:37:16,361
We were happy in Mexico.

308
00:37:18,697 --> 00:37:20,741
Do you think it’s okay to beg in the street?

309
00:37:20,824 --> 00:37:22,034
They could deport you.

310
00:37:22,117 --> 00:37:23,327
I wasn’t begging.

311
00:37:23,744 --> 00:37:25,913
And I don’t think you care what happens to me.

312
00:37:28,999 --> 00:37:30,375
I do care.

313
00:37:33,003 --> 00:37:34,421
You know I do.

314
00:38:18,799 --> 00:38:20,175
- Hello.
- Hello.

315
00:38:20,884 --> 00:38:22,386
I came to see Matthew.

316
00:38:22,469 --> 00:38:24,596
Sorry, but he already left.

317
00:38:25,973 --> 00:38:29,810
I really need to talk to him. Could you give me his cell number?

318
00:38:29,893 --> 00:38:32,020
Sorry, I can’t give you that information.

319
00:38:34,898 --> 00:38:36,024
I understand.

320
00:38:36,108 --> 00:38:37,568
Do you want to leave him a message?

321
00:38:38,318 --> 00:38:40,529
- No, it’s fine. Thanks.
- You’re welcome.

322
00:39:11,768 --> 00:39:13,312
Fernando, leave now.

323
00:39:13,395 --> 00:39:16,690
Immigration is here asking for papers. They already took Pablo.

324
00:39:35,626 --> 00:39:37,377
Why don’t you have papers?

325
00:39:38,962 --> 00:39:43,967
I was deported from New York in 2013 for dancing in Union Square.

326
00:39:44,510 --> 00:39:45,677
You were just dancing?

327
00:39:47,513 --> 00:39:51,058
People started giving me money, but I didn’t ask for it.

328
00:39:52,226 --> 00:39:54,228
What happened after you were deported?

329
00:39:54,728 --> 00:39:57,940
I hired a lawyer. I fought for a long time.

330
00:39:58,023 --> 00:40:02,152
My plan was to stay in New York but... it didn’t happen.
My plan was to stay in New York but... it didn’t happen.

331
00:40:03,070 --> 00:40:06,698
I think you have talent, and I hope we can work together.

332
00:40:06,782 --> 00:40:08,200
Thanks, I hope so too.

333
00:40:08,283 --> 00:40:12,621
Again, thanks for showing me everything today, and for letting me in.

334
00:40:12,704 --> 00:40:14,122
It’s nothing. Good luck.

335
00:40:26,468 --> 00:40:28,595
Can you pick that up?

336
00:40:35,018 --> 00:40:36,395
Oh my God!

337
00:41:18,770 --> 00:41:19,771
Very good.

338
00:41:38,207 --> 00:41:39,499
Fernando...

339
00:41:40,292 --> 00:41:42,961
I’d like to see a little more... of you today.

340
00:41:43,420 --> 00:41:44,796
Do you know "Black Swan"?

341
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:46,215
Yes, I know it.

342
00:41:46,298 --> 00:41:48,967
Great. Let’s do the ending of "Black Swan".

343
00:41:49,051 --> 00:41:51,345
- From the back row forward?
- Yes, please.

344
00:41:53,597 --> 00:41:56,433
Natasha, let’s take it from the ending of "Black Swan".

345
00:42:30,300 --> 00:42:31,301
Good.

346
00:42:32,261 --> 00:42:33,262
Very good.

347
00:42:35,222 --> 00:42:37,182
Very good. Good work.

348
00:42:37,266 --> 00:42:38,809
- Arlette.
- Yes?

349
00:42:39,852 --> 00:42:42,104
I’d like to see you with Fernando, please.

350
00:42:42,187 --> 00:42:44,314
Maybe from the beginning of "Black Swan".

351
00:42:44,398 --> 00:42:45,524
- Do you both know it?
- Yes.

352
00:42:45,607 --> 00:42:46,692
Excellent.

353
00:42:46,775 --> 00:42:48,944
- Hey.
- Nice to meet you. Arlette.

354
00:42:49,027 --> 00:42:50,028
Fernando.

355
00:42:50,612 --> 00:42:52,114
How do you want us to start?

356
00:42:52,573 --> 00:42:55,742
Let’s start from the beginning, both straight to sous-sus.

357
00:42:55,826 --> 00:42:57,578
Alright, and then you do...

358
00:42:57,661 --> 00:42:58,996
Yes, the usual...

359
00:42:59,079 --> 00:43:00,080
Normal.
Normal.

360
00:43:00,455 --> 00:43:01,790
Ok. I’ll try.

361
00:44:02,392 --> 00:44:06,522
To the pretty girls,

362
00:44:06,939 --> 00:44:10,192
we sing it like this...

363
00:44:11,485 --> 00:44:13,028
Happy birthday, my love!

364
00:44:13,111 --> 00:44:14,112
Grandma?

365
00:44:14,196 --> 00:44:15,280
No, my love.

366
00:44:17,699 --> 00:44:19,993
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

367
00:44:20,911 --> 00:44:22,496
Thank you, darling.

368
00:44:26,500 --> 00:44:28,210
Obviously I didn’t make it.

369
00:44:29,378 --> 00:44:31,338
- I’m sure it’s delicious.
- Yes.

370
00:44:50,148 --> 00:44:51,775
Come on, Fer, cheer up.

371
00:44:59,449 --> 00:45:01,034
Stop thinking about it.
Stop thinking about it.

372
00:45:51,418 --> 00:45:54,046
The person you called is not available.

373
00:45:54,129 --> 00:45:57,174
Your call will be transferred to voicemail. Leave your message...

374
00:45:57,257 --> 00:46:00,677
THE FEATHER AND THE STARS
THE FEATHER AND THE STARS

375
00:46:32,376 --> 00:46:33,585
Shall I serve you another?

376
00:46:34,586 --> 00:46:35,879
Of course. Yes.

377
00:47:39,484 --> 00:47:41,195
Excuse me. Thank you.

378
00:49:16,707 --> 00:49:17,708
Hello.

379
00:49:18,083 --> 00:49:19,084
Hello.

380
00:49:20,460 --> 00:49:21,753
Thanks for the ticket.

381
00:49:22,254 --> 00:49:23,755
I loved the performance.

382
00:49:24,923 --> 00:49:26,008
Me too.

383
00:49:26,800 --> 00:49:28,302
What? You came?

384
00:49:29,970 --> 00:49:30,971
Yes.

385
00:49:31,805 --> 00:49:32,806
Where?

386
00:49:40,439 --> 00:49:42,149
We’ll come together next time.

387
00:50:37,704 --> 00:50:38,705
Hello.

388
00:50:39,498 --> 00:50:40,499
It’s me.

389
00:52:32,486 --> 00:52:33,612
Good morning!

390
00:52:40,661 --> 00:52:43,288
There’s a mat and yoga bands in the living room.

391
00:52:44,831 --> 00:52:45,999
Do you need money?

392
00:52:47,292 --> 00:52:49,628
No, I’ll go to the motel for my wallet.

393
00:52:50,754 --> 00:52:53,090
Here’s cash and the key.

394
00:52:55,425 --> 00:52:56,552
I’ll leave soon.

395
00:52:56,969 --> 00:52:58,011
No rush.

396
00:52:58,846 --> 00:53:01,598
Have breakfast and call me if you need anything.
Have breakfast and call me if you need anything.

397
00:53:13,402 --> 00:53:14,403
Very good.

398
00:54:01,783 --> 00:54:03,285
Very good.

399
00:54:03,368 --> 00:54:04,703
Thank you all.

400
00:54:10,042 --> 00:54:12,503
It has been a true pleasure to have

401
00:54:12,586 --> 00:54:14,338
Fernando as a member of this company.

402
00:54:14,421 --> 00:54:16,798
And I want to thank you for welcoming him.

403
00:54:17,341 --> 00:54:20,177
And it really has been a very easy decision

404
00:54:20,260 --> 00:54:22,262
to give Fernando the lead role.

405
00:54:41,573 --> 00:54:44,785
Fernando... where did you learn to dance?

406
00:54:45,118 --> 00:54:46,370
In Mexico.

407
00:54:46,954 --> 00:54:48,330
Did you go to a school?

408
00:54:48,747 --> 00:54:51,166
Of course, I danced since I was a child.

409
00:54:52,459 --> 00:54:54,503
Did you also beg in the streets?

410
00:54:54,586 --> 00:54:56,088
I don’t beg.

411
00:54:56,463 --> 00:54:58,423
I thought that’s how you met Matthew.

412
00:54:58,841 --> 00:55:01,260
I just wanted a ticket to the ballet, I wasn’t begging...
I just wanted a ticket to the ballet, I wasn’t begging...

413
00:55:01,343 --> 00:55:03,971
He saw you before the show, weren’t you asking for money?

414
00:55:04,054 --> 00:55:05,305
- Joe!
- What?

415
00:55:05,389 --> 00:55:08,141
So what if he danced outside the theater? You wouldn’t dare.

416
00:55:08,725 --> 00:55:10,686
I don’t have to dance in the street for money.

417
00:55:10,769 --> 00:55:13,146
- Shut up!
- It was clear he just wanted a ticket.

418
00:55:13,230 --> 00:55:16,066
Since he’s undocumented, it took guts to do it.

419
00:55:17,484 --> 00:55:18,777
Why don’t we just leave?

420
00:55:22,573 --> 00:55:24,366
Damn gringo bastards, brother.

421
00:55:25,325 --> 00:55:28,495
We cross the border, wipe their asses

422
00:55:28,579 --> 00:55:30,122
and there’s no problem.

423
00:55:30,205 --> 00:55:32,457
But just take someone’s job away and look...

424
00:55:32,541 --> 00:55:33,876
they send you to hell.

425
00:55:35,377 --> 00:55:36,378
So unfair.

426
00:55:43,802 --> 00:55:45,512
Serve yourself another, Lety, please.

427
00:55:47,055 --> 00:55:48,515
And pour one for yourself too.

428
00:55:48,599 --> 00:55:49,725
Hi, Mom!

429
00:55:50,601 --> 00:55:52,644
I’m fine, yes. I came to the bar.

430
00:55:54,021 --> 00:55:55,522
No, go to sleep now.

431
00:55:57,357 --> 00:55:58,358
Ok.

432
00:55:58,901 --> 00:56:00,235
I love you too.
I love you too.

433
00:56:01,195 --> 00:56:02,196
Bye.

434
00:56:04,489 --> 00:56:05,949
I’ll introduce you.

435
00:56:06,658 --> 00:56:09,411
Hello, girls. This is Fernando.

436
00:56:09,494 --> 00:56:11,580
- He’s a dance teacher here.
- Hello, Fernando.

437
00:56:11,663 --> 00:56:12,748
Hello. Nice to meet you.

438
00:56:12,831 --> 00:56:15,959
They’re students. Very interested in learning ballet.

439
00:56:16,043 --> 00:56:19,046
- They are Robert, Charlie, and Lily.
- Hi.

440
00:56:19,129 --> 00:56:20,714
Hi. Why ballet?

441
00:56:21,632 --> 00:56:24,510
We went to the ballet once and loved it so much.

442
00:56:24,593 --> 00:56:26,595
It was unforgettable for all of us.

443
00:56:26,678 --> 00:56:27,679
Yes.

444
00:56:27,763 --> 00:56:29,973
What was the best part of the performance?

445
00:56:30,057 --> 00:56:31,058
The lifts.

446
00:56:31,141 --> 00:56:33,185
- The lifts?
- Yes, it was impressive.

447
00:56:33,268 --> 00:56:35,687
You must work hard, you know that, right?

448
00:56:35,771 --> 00:56:39,358
Yes, they told us we must come here every afternoon... so...

449
00:56:39,441 --> 00:56:40,817
At least six days.

450
00:56:40,901 --> 00:56:42,653
- Six days?
- Oh wow. Ok.

451
00:56:42,736 --> 00:56:44,404
It’s very strict.

452
00:56:44,488 --> 00:56:46,865
- Don’t be late or you’ll have problems.
- Yes.

453
00:56:46,949 --> 00:56:48,575
- Never late.
- Nice to see you.

454
00:56:48,659 --> 00:56:50,244
- Bye.
- A pleasure.

455
00:56:50,911 --> 00:56:53,830
It was great. Cool. You know.

456
00:56:53,914 --> 00:56:55,374
What happened to you?

457
00:56:55,457 --> 00:56:57,000
Dance, that’s what happened.

458
00:56:57,835 --> 00:56:59,169
Ice helps.

459
00:57:00,087 --> 00:57:02,005
- Does it hurt?
- No.

460
00:57:02,422 --> 00:57:05,175
Well, it hurts a little more than the massage.

461
00:57:06,343 --> 00:57:08,971
- Did the massage hurt?
- No, not much.

462
00:57:09,721 --> 00:57:13,392
- You should put more pressure.
- More pressure, huh?

463
00:57:13,475 --> 00:57:15,477
- Yes, thanks.
- But I don’t want to...

464
00:57:15,561 --> 00:57:17,729
- It’s fine.
- Oh, darling.

465
00:57:21,149 --> 00:57:23,068
- Is that okay?
- Yes.

466
00:57:26,780 --> 00:57:29,074
You introduced me as their teacher.

467
00:57:29,867 --> 00:57:32,703
- Juanita doesn’t know we’re together.
- It’s obvious we’re together.

468
00:57:32,786 --> 00:57:34,788
It’s obvious you’re always acting.

469
00:57:35,622 --> 00:57:37,749
I’m not acting, you’re their teacher.

470
00:57:37,833 --> 00:57:40,836
- Can I be both?
- Yes, of course.

471
00:57:49,636 --> 00:57:50,637
Hello.

472
00:57:56,101 --> 00:57:57,102
A pleasure.

473
00:57:58,145 --> 00:57:59,146
Hello.

474
00:58:01,732 --> 00:58:03,192
- Do you remember?
- Of course.

475
00:58:03,275 --> 00:58:04,526
Well, it doesn’t seem like it.

476
00:58:07,029 --> 00:58:09,990
Good afternoon everyone, thank you very much for being here.

477
00:58:10,365 --> 00:58:13,660
I’d love to introduce the man of the moment, my father,

478
00:58:14,036 --> 00:58:15,537
Michael McCarthy.

479
00:58:15,621 --> 00:58:17,748
We wouldn’t be here if not for his generosity.

480
00:58:17,831 --> 00:58:20,292
Let’s give him a big round of applause, please.

481
00:58:25,964 --> 00:58:27,966
Well, my daughter is very generous.

482
00:58:28,425 --> 00:58:31,428
The truth is none of this would be possible

483
00:58:31,512 --> 00:58:35,349
without the foundation that she and her brother Jake created.

484
00:58:36,141 --> 00:58:38,810
So I’d like you to give them applause, please.

485
00:58:41,772 --> 00:58:44,358
We couldn’t be more excited to be here

486
00:58:44,441 --> 00:58:46,193
and learn about what you’re doing. So please,

487
00:58:46,276 --> 00:58:48,695
continue with your activities and don’t let us interrupt you.

488
00:58:49,696 --> 00:58:50,697
- Thanks.
- It’s nothing.

489
00:58:50,781 --> 00:58:52,366
You were turning, right?

490
00:58:52,449 --> 00:58:55,244
Look... you turn backwards and then...

491
00:58:55,327 --> 00:58:57,329
Something like that. Hello. Fernando.

492
00:58:57,955 --> 00:59:01,166
And then, yes... you raise your arm.
And then, yes... you raise your arm.

493
00:59:01,250 --> 00:59:02,334
- Hello.
- Fernando.

494
00:59:02,417 --> 00:59:03,836
- Delighted.
- Thank you very much.

495
00:59:03,919 --> 00:59:05,379
Don’t thank me. Please.

496
00:59:05,462 --> 00:59:06,630
Yes.

497
00:59:06,713 --> 00:59:09,174
Yes, like that. From the top.

498
00:59:09,883 --> 00:59:12,511
Don’t forget your position. Yes.

499
00:59:12,594 --> 00:59:14,763
Ok, like this. Wait.

500
00:59:14,847 --> 00:59:15,848
One...

501
00:59:16,306 --> 00:59:18,267
Two, three.

502
00:59:18,350 --> 00:59:19,351
And lift.

503
00:59:22,855 --> 00:59:23,856
Hello.

504
00:59:25,315 --> 00:59:28,068
It turned out perfect, you look very handsome.

505
00:59:28,151 --> 00:59:29,695
- Thanks.
- Did you have a good day?

506
00:59:29,778 --> 00:59:32,072
Yes, it was good, but long.

507
00:59:32,155 --> 00:59:34,658
I had a three‑hour rehearsal,

508
00:59:35,325 --> 00:59:37,411
- until...
- Thanks. Want a glass of wine?

509
00:59:37,494 --> 00:59:38,579
- Yes.
- One more.

510
00:59:38,662 --> 00:59:42,332
During rehearsal, one of the guys dropped a ballerina.

511
00:59:42,416 --> 00:59:44,042
- No!
- Yes.

512
00:59:44,126 --> 00:59:48,088
Then there was an argument about whose fault it was.

513
00:59:48,422 --> 00:59:50,591
And he didn’t want to take responsibility.

514
00:59:50,674 --> 00:59:53,010
It’s a general rule in ballet...

515
00:59:53,093 --> 00:59:54,094
- Jennifer?
- Daphne.

516
00:59:54,178 --> 00:59:55,179
- Hi.
- Hi.

517
00:59:55,262 --> 00:59:57,097
- Good to see you.
- Long time.

518
00:59:57,181 --> 00:59:58,765
- I know.
- Good to see you.

519
00:59:59,308 --> 01:00:02,686
He’s Fernando, an exceptionally talented dancer.
He’s Fernando, an exceptionally talented dancer.

520
01:00:03,103 --> 01:00:05,063
- A pleasure, Fernando.
- The pleasure is mine.

521
01:00:05,147 --> 01:00:06,523
Is he in your program?

522
01:00:06,607 --> 01:00:09,109
No, he’s in the San Francisco Ballet company.

523
01:00:09,193 --> 01:00:10,777
- Fantastic!
- Enjoy your meal.

524
01:00:10,861 --> 01:00:11,862
Thanks.

525
01:00:12,529 --> 01:00:13,488
You were saying?

526
01:00:16,950 --> 01:00:17,951
Pointe flex.

527
01:00:55,197 --> 01:00:56,657
I’m hungry.

528
01:00:57,282 --> 01:00:58,951
Well, you’ve been working...

529
01:00:59,409 --> 01:01:01,995
at least for an hour.
at least for an hour.

530
01:01:02,079 --> 01:01:03,330
I try.

531
01:01:03,413 --> 01:01:06,333
- I know.
- I added tofu, do you like it?

532
01:01:06,416 --> 01:01:09,127
I like everything you make.

533
01:01:09,211 --> 01:01:11,421
I’ve never had so much food at home.

534
01:01:11,505 --> 01:01:13,340
We could have gone to a restaurant.

535
01:01:23,600 --> 01:01:25,269
Don’t use your key, I’ll open.

536
01:01:27,145 --> 01:01:28,438
Who is it?

537
01:01:28,522 --> 01:01:31,149
It’s my brother, I didn’t know he’d come.

538
01:01:31,859 --> 01:01:33,235
Do you think he’ll stay?

539
01:01:33,652 --> 01:01:34,736
I don’t know.

540
01:01:37,281 --> 01:01:40,367
Hey, hey! You’re coming out with me today.

541
01:01:40,784 --> 01:01:42,995
I have an extra ticket for the game.

542
01:01:44,037 --> 01:01:45,664
- Take your coat.
- Well...

543
01:01:45,747 --> 01:01:47,708
It’s good to see you. I’ll have a glass of water.

544
01:01:47,791 --> 01:01:49,126
- Oh, hi.
- Hi.

545
01:01:52,796 --> 01:01:55,966
I know you. From the community center.

546
01:01:56,049 --> 01:01:57,050
Yes.

547
01:01:57,134 --> 01:01:59,178
You... yes...

548
01:01:59,511 --> 01:02:01,638
- Remind me.
- I’m a ballet teacher.
- Remind me.
- I’m a ballet teacher.

549
01:02:04,641 --> 01:02:06,351
The ballet teacher.

550
01:02:07,186 --> 01:02:09,646
- From Mexico or...?
- Yes.

551
01:02:11,815 --> 01:02:13,025
Great.

552
01:02:14,067 --> 01:02:16,528
- Jake.
- I’m Fernando.

553
01:02:16,612 --> 01:02:18,864
Fernando, of course. Good to see you.

554
01:02:20,073 --> 01:02:21,241
Likewise.

555
01:02:21,617 --> 01:02:23,368
I’d invite you...

556
01:02:23,702 --> 01:02:25,621
but I only have one extra ticket.

557
01:02:26,663 --> 01:02:28,582
Looks like I interrupted you.

558
01:02:29,708 --> 01:02:33,462
I’ll leave you two alone and...

559
01:02:33,545 --> 01:02:34,630
Goodbye.

560
01:02:35,756 --> 01:02:37,758
- I’ll call you tomorrow.
- Yes, that’s fine.

561
01:02:39,134 --> 01:02:40,385
Have fun.

562
01:03:15,128 --> 01:03:17,297
You’re doing well, the rhythm is perfect.

563
01:03:17,714 --> 01:03:19,633
Alright, let’s start, mark the step.

564
01:03:21,385 --> 01:03:22,386
Good.

565
01:03:22,803 --> 01:03:25,430
One, two, three, four.

566
01:03:25,514 --> 01:03:27,975
One, two, three, four.

567
01:03:28,058 --> 01:03:29,309
One. Super!

568
01:03:30,435 --> 01:03:31,854
One... Yes!

569
01:03:32,813 --> 01:03:33,814
Keep going.

570
01:03:36,567 --> 01:03:39,278
So, it’s about those places... and that.

571
01:03:39,361 --> 01:03:40,362
I think...

572
01:03:41,071 --> 01:03:42,197
Hello!

573
01:03:42,281 --> 01:03:43,282
Hi, Dad.

574
01:03:44,992 --> 01:03:46,368
Thanks for coming.

575
01:03:46,702 --> 01:03:47,703
Of course.

576
01:03:48,036 --> 01:03:50,414
- Shall we get a coffee?
- I already had one.

577
01:03:50,497 --> 01:03:53,500
Let’s go out. I won’t take much of your time.

578
01:03:57,546 --> 01:03:58,964
I’ll get straight to the point.

579
01:03:59,047 --> 01:04:02,509
Jake said he saw the Mexican dancer at your house yesterday.
Jake said he saw the Mexican dancer at your house yesterday.

580
01:04:04,511 --> 01:04:05,846
Does he live with you?

581
01:04:07,347 --> 01:04:08,974
Dad... it’s nothing.

582
01:04:09,808 --> 01:04:13,604
You know I want you to be happy and have a relationship.

583
01:04:13,687 --> 01:04:15,939
And give me some grandchildren.

584
01:04:16,023 --> 01:04:18,066
You know I tried but I can’t.

585
01:04:18,150 --> 01:04:21,195
- I know, but I didn’t come to talk about that.
- Why are you here?

586
01:04:21,278 --> 01:04:23,030
What do you want us to talk about?

587
01:04:23,363 --> 01:04:26,158
Look, I’m glad you help immigrants.

588
01:04:27,409 --> 01:04:28,952
You know I support you with that.

589
01:04:29,036 --> 01:04:31,079
But there are limits, do you understand what I’m saying?

590
01:04:39,004 --> 01:04:41,715
- Excuse me, may we order?
- Of course.

591
01:04:41,798 --> 01:04:43,091
I’d like the sea bass.

592
01:04:43,967 --> 01:04:45,511
- Good choice. Thank you.
- Thanks.

593
01:04:51,808 --> 01:04:53,143
Sir?

594
01:04:53,977 --> 01:04:55,854
May I recommend the bass?

595
01:04:58,273 --> 01:04:59,691
What are “capers”?

596
01:04:59,775 --> 01:05:01,360
Ah. Capers.
Ah. Capers.

597
01:05:01,443 --> 01:05:02,903
Alright. I’ll have that.

598
01:05:02,986 --> 01:05:04,530
- You won’t regret it.
- Thanks.

599
01:05:04,613 --> 01:05:06,490
- Where are you from?
- I’m from Mexico City, you?

600
01:05:06,573 --> 01:05:08,033
Ah... I’m from Puebla.

601
01:05:08,617 --> 01:05:10,744
But we’ve been here 20 years now.

602
01:05:10,827 --> 01:05:13,163
- Well, a lifetime.
- Yes, it’s a long time.

603
01:05:13,247 --> 01:05:14,373
Are you visiting?

604
01:05:14,456 --> 01:05:16,208
I live here. I’m teaching ballet.

605
01:05:16,291 --> 01:05:17,876
Oh, that’s great.

606
01:05:17,960 --> 01:05:20,170
- I’m Fernando.
- I’m Joaquín. Nice to meet you.

607
01:05:20,254 --> 01:05:23,048
- Nice to meet you, Joaquín.
- Likewise. Would you like something to drink?

608
01:05:23,131 --> 01:05:24,842
I’ll start with the goat cheese salad.

609
01:05:24,925 --> 01:05:27,219
- Ok.
- He means drinks.

610
01:05:27,302 --> 01:05:30,889
Oh, sorry. No, I’m fine. I didn’t mean to interrupt your talk.

611
01:05:31,306 --> 01:05:34,518
- It’s fine, Joaquín, thanks.
- Ok. I’ll be right back.

612
01:05:34,601 --> 01:05:35,602
Excuse me.

613
01:05:37,187 --> 01:05:38,438
Did you forget me?

614
01:05:39,898 --> 01:05:42,276
- Why?
- Well, you can speak in English.

615
01:05:42,943 --> 01:05:44,862
I think you should know a little Spanish, right?

616
01:05:44,945 --> 01:05:47,197
After all the time you spent in Mexico,

617
01:05:47,281 --> 01:05:49,283
having a Mexican boyfriend...

618
01:05:49,366 --> 01:05:51,493
- A little, miss.
- Enough.

619
01:05:51,577 --> 01:05:53,036
- Please!
- Enough!

620
01:05:54,705 --> 01:05:56,707
I’m in a bad mood, sorry.

621
01:05:56,790 --> 01:05:58,792
I had an argument with my dad.

622
01:06:01,670 --> 01:06:02,880
Was it about me?

623
01:06:03,213 --> 01:06:04,298
No.

624
01:06:04,381 --> 01:06:06,800
Not at all, in fact it was Jake’s fault.

625
01:06:09,428 --> 01:06:11,680
It was because he saw me at your house the other day.

626
01:06:43,504 --> 01:06:44,880
- How are you, son?
- Very well.

627
01:06:44,963 --> 01:06:46,632
- Really?
- I haven’t seen you at the meetings.

628
01:06:46,715 --> 01:06:48,842
- That skateboard is very fast, eh.
- Tell me when and we’ll meet.

629
01:06:48,926 --> 01:06:51,094
- No? I’ll greet your mom.
- We’ll go for breakfast.

630
01:06:51,178 --> 01:06:52,846
Why aren’t you in school?

631
01:06:52,930 --> 01:06:55,474
The teachers have a school meeting.

632
01:06:55,557 --> 01:06:56,725
Hello.

633
01:06:56,808 --> 01:06:58,185
The first Friday of every month.

634
01:06:58,268 --> 01:07:00,979
Will you let your sister ride it? You must lend it to her.
Will you let your sister ride it? You must lend it to her.

635
01:07:01,063 --> 01:07:03,106
Are you happy not to have gone to school?

636
01:07:03,190 --> 01:07:04,399
Yes!

637
01:07:05,275 --> 01:07:07,611
- We talked about you at the meeting.
- Ah, sure.

638
01:07:08,028 --> 01:07:09,112
Well, we’re leaving.

639
01:07:09,821 --> 01:07:11,073
- Goodbye, kids.
- Bye.

640
01:07:26,630 --> 01:07:28,799
Up to there, stop.

641
01:07:33,470 --> 01:07:34,721
From the side.

642
01:07:35,222 --> 01:07:36,223
That’s better.

643
01:07:39,685 --> 01:07:41,478
Stop for a moment, please.

644
01:07:41,562 --> 01:07:43,105
Fernando, can you come?

645
01:08:11,592 --> 01:08:12,759
IMMIGRATION

646
01:08:25,314 --> 01:08:28,066
We already tried over there and it didn’t work.

647
01:08:28,149 --> 01:08:31,403
She must have contacts, it’s her business.

648
01:08:31,486 --> 01:08:35,073
She must have contacts in Tijuana, at all the borders.

649
01:08:35,157 --> 01:08:36,700
Do you already have contacts there?

650
01:08:37,075 --> 01:08:41,246
Not yet in Tijuana, but the coyote who passed us must have contacts.

651
01:08:41,330 --> 01:08:43,582
- How much did they charge you?
- They charged us eight thousand.

652
01:08:44,457 --> 01:08:45,751
Eight thousand.

653
01:08:45,834 --> 01:08:47,127
Yes, it’s a lot, but...

654
01:08:47,211 --> 01:08:49,546
I think yes, she’ll connect us, buddy.

655
01:09:36,760 --> 01:09:39,263
- Are you all Mexicans?
- Yes!

656
01:09:39,680 --> 01:09:41,390
Show me your INE, please.

657
01:09:41,473 --> 01:09:43,140
- I don’t have INE.
- You don’t have INE.

658
01:09:43,225 --> 01:09:44,768
- But I’m Mexican.
- Where are you from?

659
01:09:44,852 --> 01:09:46,520
- From Honduras.
- From Honduras. This way.

660
01:09:46,603 --> 01:09:48,689
- I come from El Salvador.
- This way, please.

661
01:09:48,772 --> 01:09:52,109
Everyone else go with my colleagues and give some information.

662
01:09:52,192 --> 01:09:53,986
Go ahead, please. Go ahead.

663
01:09:54,069 --> 01:09:56,029
Look friend, we’re from Venezuela.

664
01:09:56,113 --> 01:09:57,364
Identification, please.

665
01:09:57,447 --> 01:09:59,992
You are... Tomás Alba?

666
01:10:00,409 --> 01:10:03,120
- Go that way, please.
- Will it take long, miss?

667
01:10:03,203 --> 01:10:05,539
- One or two hours at most.
- Thanks.

668
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:10,085
- Last name?
- Let’s see, gentlemen!

669
01:10:13,839 --> 01:10:15,299
Go ahead, come in.

670
01:10:15,382 --> 01:10:18,051
Officer, even if we’re not Mexicans, we have rights.

671
01:10:18,135 --> 01:10:20,345
To go to the bathroom, to drink water, to see a doctor.

672
01:10:21,889 --> 01:10:24,433
We’re only migrants, we’re not criminals.

673
01:10:24,516 --> 01:10:26,143
Why do you treat us like this?

674
01:10:26,226 --> 01:10:28,228
He always says the same thing.

675
01:10:29,980 --> 01:10:32,816
- It comes in here.
- The passport too?

676
01:10:32,900 --> 01:10:36,695
The passport and the case number also come here, sir.

677
01:10:36,778 --> 01:10:38,697
Any questions you can call us.

678
01:10:38,780 --> 01:10:39,990
My name is Arturo.

679
01:11:04,890 --> 01:11:09,394
Passengers of flight 114, boarding is ready.

680
01:11:09,811 --> 01:11:12,981
Please go to counter 112 for check‑in.

681
01:11:17,694 --> 01:11:19,321
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

682
01:11:19,905 --> 01:11:20,906
We’ve arrived.

683
01:11:27,788 --> 01:11:28,956
I’m fine.

684
01:11:31,917 --> 01:11:33,252
When will you come?

685
01:11:39,591 --> 01:11:40,592
Ok.

686
01:12:04,950 --> 01:12:06,535
How long will you stay?

687
01:12:06,618 --> 01:12:09,538
I have to return Monday, I have a meeting in New York.

688
01:12:10,873 --> 01:12:12,124
What day is today?

689
01:12:12,541 --> 01:12:13,750
It’s Monday.

690
01:12:15,794 --> 01:12:17,588
I’ll be here all week.

691
01:12:19,131 --> 01:12:20,799
I’ll return immediately.

692
01:12:54,583 --> 01:12:56,668
We don’t need anything in San Francisco.

693
01:12:56,752 --> 01:12:58,837
We can start our company here.

694
01:12:59,546 --> 01:13:03,217
Yes, another location. Experienced dancers.
Yes, another location. Experienced dancers.

695
01:13:04,259 --> 01:13:05,761
That would take time.

696
01:13:06,345 --> 01:13:07,554
We have time.

697
01:13:09,848 --> 01:13:11,683
I can come more often.

698
01:13:13,769 --> 01:13:16,271
I could almost live here.

699
01:13:18,357 --> 01:13:19,691
That would be nice.

700
01:14:12,828 --> 01:14:14,788
No, he proposed in Las Vegas.

701
01:14:14,872 --> 01:14:18,333
She said, “Let’s do it” and he said, “Let’s do it in Las Vegas.”

702
01:14:18,417 --> 01:14:20,502
- He can’t go to Las Vegas, so...
- No.

703
01:14:20,586 --> 01:14:22,963
- My joke was...
- Wait, wait, wait.

704
01:14:23,046 --> 01:14:25,632
- The joke is good.
- There may be a chance

705
01:14:26,008 --> 01:14:27,092
to try again.

706
01:14:27,176 --> 01:14:31,138
I was married and divorced and it’s not... a big deal.

707
01:14:31,221 --> 01:14:32,931
- Really?
- Wow, I didn’t know that.

708
01:14:33,015 --> 01:14:35,225
Because you haven’t married him, it’s great.

709
01:14:35,309 --> 01:14:36,393
Thanks.

710
01:14:37,394 --> 01:14:40,272
- They’re the best.
- Super.

711
01:14:40,355 --> 01:14:41,773
But what a good idea!

712
01:14:41,857 --> 01:14:43,901
Cheers! Drink up.

713
01:14:47,696 --> 01:14:49,364
Wedding next year.

714
01:14:49,865 --> 01:14:52,284
- Why so long?
- Where?

715
01:14:52,993 --> 01:14:57,206
No, the idea was obviously to have married already,

716
01:14:57,289 --> 01:14:59,333
but he keeps putting it off.

717
01:14:59,416 --> 01:15:01,502
And honestly I’m a little tired.
And honestly I’m a little tired.

718
01:15:01,585 --> 01:15:05,422
So... it would be good to cross again.

719
01:15:05,923 --> 01:15:08,884
Don’t you think I should look for a career in San Francisco?

720
01:15:08,967 --> 01:15:12,429
- Wouldn’t you like me to come back?
- No, no, I’d love for you to return.

721
01:15:12,513 --> 01:15:15,182
- We’ve tried...
- Ok, I want to return.

722
01:15:16,767 --> 01:15:19,019
- Let’s go back.
- Safely.

723
01:15:19,102 --> 01:15:21,772
- In a way he doesn’t risk... you know.
- Cheers... cheers because you’re coming back.

724
01:15:21,855 --> 01:15:23,815
No, no, no, no.

725
01:15:38,789 --> 01:15:39,915
Did you eat anything?

726
01:15:41,583 --> 01:15:44,336
- No.
- No. Have you drunk on an empty stomach?

727
01:15:45,254 --> 01:15:47,756
- Yes.
- Ok. Eat this.

728
01:15:49,758 --> 01:15:51,260
No, thanks.

729
01:15:52,010 --> 01:15:54,429
I can’t go to New York if you don’t take care of yourself.

730
01:15:55,597 --> 01:15:56,682
Don’t go.

731
01:15:59,309 --> 01:16:00,519
Just stay.
Just stay.

732
01:16:04,648 --> 01:16:05,649
Of course.

733
01:16:07,109 --> 01:16:08,485
Where’s the mezcal?

734
01:16:09,361 --> 01:16:10,696
There’s mezcal here for...

735
01:16:18,453 --> 01:16:20,497
Why do you like San Francisco?

736
01:16:24,459 --> 01:16:26,461
What will you do there that you can’t do here?

737
01:16:28,714 --> 01:16:31,383
They’ll never make you an official member of the company.

738
01:16:37,097 --> 01:16:38,932
We won’t be able to be together there.

739
01:16:42,352 --> 01:16:44,479
I can’t cancel my trip to New York.

740
01:16:44,563 --> 01:16:47,608
It’s not fair that you make me leave you like this.

741
01:16:48,734 --> 01:16:49,902
Don’t cancel it.

742
01:16:51,111 --> 01:16:53,447
Look... just go to New York.

743
01:16:53,989 --> 01:16:56,366
I didn’t want to tell you until I had it all figured out

744
01:16:56,450 --> 01:16:59,369
but I found someone who can help me cross through El Paso.

745
01:17:00,120 --> 01:17:03,040
- I won’t give you money to kill yourself.
- I don’t need money.

746
01:17:03,665 --> 01:17:05,834
I just need to get to Juárez on Tuesday.

747
01:17:05,918 --> 01:17:09,296
When you finish in New York, I’ll be able to be in San Francisco.

748
01:17:11,465 --> 01:17:12,966
We weren’t happy there!

749
01:17:13,342 --> 01:17:14,843
But I was.

750
01:17:19,306 --> 01:17:20,641
Don’t worry.

751
01:17:22,643 --> 01:17:25,270
They told me this time we won’t go in a trailer.

752
01:17:26,313 --> 01:17:29,107
So it’s safer and faster.

753
01:17:35,030 --> 01:17:37,115
You know I’d do anything for you, right?

754
01:17:37,199 --> 01:17:38,367
Of course.

755
01:17:39,034 --> 01:17:40,619
I have something to tell you.

756
01:17:44,289 --> 01:17:46,416
Then you decide if you want us to stay together.

757
01:17:49,253 --> 01:17:51,505
Tell me if you want me to come back after...

758
01:17:52,464 --> 01:17:54,007
my trip or if...

759
01:17:55,634 --> 01:17:57,302
you don’t want to see me again.

760
01:18:03,934 --> 01:18:05,018
What’s wrong?

761
01:18:10,941 --> 01:18:12,442
I made you get deported.

762
01:18:16,947 --> 01:18:18,282
You were never going to...

763
01:18:19,783 --> 01:18:22,995
return to Mexico and we couldn’t be together in...

764
01:18:23,537 --> 01:18:25,998
In San Francisco, there was too much pressure, you know?

765
01:18:26,582 --> 01:18:30,127
I called Immigration Services, said you were an illegal immigrant

766
01:18:30,210 --> 01:18:34,047
that you were dancing in the company and had been deported before,

767
01:18:34,131 --> 01:18:36,049
in 2013.

768
01:18:42,973 --> 01:18:45,309
You have to understand why I did it.

769
01:18:50,355 --> 01:18:52,399
This time everything will be better.

770
01:18:52,733 --> 01:18:54,276
I’ll be here more often.

771
01:18:56,028 --> 01:18:57,821
We’ll have our company here.

772
01:19:00,657 --> 01:19:02,451
Think about it while I’m gone.

773
01:19:03,994 --> 01:19:05,162
And if you don’t...

774
01:19:08,081 --> 01:19:10,209
If you don’t want me to come back, you can stay here,

775
01:19:10,292 --> 01:19:12,711
I’ll pay the bills. I’ll never abandon you.

776
01:19:15,464 --> 01:19:17,716
I did it for us because I love you.

777
01:19:22,221 --> 01:19:24,264
- Do you want us to be together?
- Yes.

778
01:19:24,348 --> 01:19:25,557
Very much.

779
01:19:26,767 --> 01:19:27,768
Ok.

780
01:20:12,729 --> 01:20:14,064
Fernando...

781
01:20:43,635 --> 01:20:45,053
Can we talk?

782
01:20:56,023 --> 01:20:57,274
Fernando.

783
01:21:08,410 --> 01:21:09,828
I need to go to the bathroom.

784
01:21:09,912 --> 01:21:11,330
You can go in the yard.

785
01:21:11,413 --> 01:21:12,414
No!

786
01:21:49,159 --> 01:21:50,410
Can I go now?

787
01:22:02,130 --> 01:22:04,258
I thought the idea was to be together, right?

788
01:22:05,384 --> 01:22:08,720
You’re right to be upset, I’m very sorry.

789
01:22:09,721 --> 01:22:10,931
I’m not.

790
01:22:12,057 --> 01:22:13,851
I’m happy we’re together.

791
01:22:17,312 --> 01:22:19,314
- Me too.
- I’m going to shower.

792
01:22:21,358 --> 01:22:22,818
Or maybe I won’t.

793
01:22:25,404 --> 01:22:27,197
I forgot you liked me sweaty.

794
01:22:46,633 --> 01:22:48,594
Stop, enough!

795
01:23:06,862 --> 01:23:08,155
Stop!

796
01:23:49,571 --> 01:23:50,572
No.

797
01:24:28,694 --> 01:24:30,112
Have you forgiven me?

798
01:24:33,282 --> 01:24:35,242
Did you file my residency application?

799
01:24:57,598 --> 01:24:58,640
No!

800
01:25:16,992 --> 01:25:18,535
Thank you very much.

801
01:25:18,619 --> 01:25:22,164
Sorry, I forgot to tell you it wasn’t necessary for you to come today.

802
01:25:22,247 --> 01:25:23,498
Go home.

803
01:25:24,166 --> 01:25:26,418
She hasn’t been feeling well today.

804
01:25:27,503 --> 01:25:30,255
You know? Go. Come another day.

805
01:25:30,589 --> 01:25:31,840
Martha?

806
01:25:38,722 --> 01:25:41,600
No, it’s not necessary. I’ll take care of Jennifer these days.

807
01:25:41,683 --> 01:25:44,228
And when she feels better, I’ll call you.

808
01:25:44,311 --> 01:25:45,854
- Are you sure, young man?
- Sure.

809
01:25:45,938 --> 01:25:48,023
Sorry I didn’t call to cancel earlier.

810
01:25:48,106 --> 01:25:49,441
I’ll wait for your call, young man.

811
01:26:06,708 --> 01:26:08,752
My family is waiting for me in New York.

812
01:26:11,630 --> 01:26:14,091
- I’m going out, do you need anything?
- Let me go.

813
01:26:36,113 --> 01:26:37,197
What happened, Rafa?

814
01:26:37,281 --> 01:26:39,366
Sir, sorry for coming without notice,

815
01:26:39,449 --> 01:26:42,786
but I call the young lady and it goes to voicemail.

816
01:26:42,870 --> 01:26:46,748
Just to check if the airport service for Monday is still on.

817
01:26:47,249 --> 01:26:48,292
Not anymore.

818
01:26:48,625 --> 01:26:51,336
She’s staying here. Good night, Rafa.

819
01:26:51,420 --> 01:26:52,462
Ok, sir.

820
01:30:35,269 --> 01:30:36,270
Let’s go.

821
01:30:41,900 --> 01:30:44,111
- Tell them what you did to me.
- Shut your damn mouth.

822
01:30:44,194 --> 01:30:45,988
Tell them to leave our house.

823
01:30:49,950 --> 01:30:51,159
I’ll be back!

824
01:30:52,119 --> 01:30:54,079
Everyone will know what you did to me.

825
01:30:55,956 --> 01:30:58,041
I’ll tell everyone who you are!

826
01:30:59,543 --> 01:31:01,044
A liar!
A liar!

827
01:31:02,379 --> 01:31:03,505
What do we do?

828
01:32:12,991 --> 01:32:13,992
Hi, Dad.

829
01:32:16,286 --> 01:32:17,454
Yes, I know.

830
01:32:25,170 --> 01:32:26,213
Alright.

831
01:32:35,639 --> 01:32:36,640
See you.

832
01:34:35,884 --> 01:34:39,054
DEDICATED TO THE MEMORY OF MY DEAR FRIEND GRÉGOIRE LASSALLE
