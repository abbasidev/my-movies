1
00:00:33,367 --> 00:00:36,905
Okay. So,
Mr. "Hey, sweetie pie,"

2
00:00:36,971 --> 00:00:38,438
is from Denver.

3
00:00:38,506 --> 00:00:40,374
Some kind of salesman.

4
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:42,142
His name's
on his shirt.

5
00:01:12,472 --> 00:01:14,441
Is Tamara here?

6
00:01:35,228 --> 00:01:36,229
Please.

7
00:01:37,565 --> 00:01:38,967
I have a family.

8
00:01:40,034 --> 00:01:41,101
No. I beg you, please.

9
00:01:45,205 --> 00:01:48,342
Help me, please.

10
00:02:07,528 --> 00:02:08,495
No.

11
00:02:09,631 --> 00:02:10,665
No.

12
00:02:53,141 --> 00:02:54,142
Maya?

13
00:02:55,910 --> 00:02:57,578
Maya?

14
00:02:57,645 --> 00:02:59,312
You're at Venus
County Hospital.

15
00:02:59,981 --> 00:03:01,181
I'm Nurse Danica.

16
00:03:01,916 --> 00:03:03,283
I'm Dr. Tate.

17
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:05,687
Ryan? Ryan? Where's Ryan?

18
00:03:07,354 --> 00:03:08,388
I'm so sorry.

19
00:03:10,692 --> 00:03:11,793
He didn't make it.

20
00:03:14,629 --> 00:03:16,831
Unfortunately,
he'd lost too much blood.

21
00:03:33,548 --> 00:03:35,215
Ryan.

22
00:03:44,792 --> 00:03:46,094
There were
three of them.

23
00:03:46,894 --> 00:03:48,395
Two were like, um...

24
00:03:49,396 --> 00:03:51,099
doll masks?

25
00:03:51,165 --> 00:03:52,499
Did you
and your boyfriend see...

26
00:03:52,567 --> 00:03:53,701
Fiance.

27
00:03:54,401 --> 00:03:55,503
Fiance.

28
00:03:56,671 --> 00:03:58,673
Did you or your fiance
see anything else?

29
00:04:00,074 --> 00:04:01,943
You almost died.

30
00:04:02,009 --> 00:04:04,545
Maybe your memory's
just a little bit fogged up.

31
00:04:07,148 --> 00:04:08,683
They had a truck.

32
00:04:10,218 --> 00:04:12,620
A red truck.

33
00:04:16,190 --> 00:04:17,191
I felt like they liked it.

34
00:04:20,895 --> 00:04:22,262
Like they enjoyed it.

35
00:04:24,999 --> 00:04:27,201
It was some kind of ritual.

36
00:04:33,741 --> 00:04:35,710
Has this happened before?

37
00:04:36,677 --> 00:04:37,779
Well, there's been...

38
00:04:37,845 --> 00:04:38,880
Tommy.

39
00:04:42,049 --> 00:04:44,384
Is there anything else
you can remember?

40
00:04:48,222 --> 00:04:50,057
Tamara.

41
00:04:50,124 --> 00:04:52,292
They were asking
about a girl named Tamara.

42
00:05:01,903 --> 00:05:03,104
Who's Tamara?

43
00:05:05,573 --> 00:05:07,642
Dr. Tate says time
to wrap it up, Sheriff.

44
00:05:10,778 --> 00:05:12,312
Doc knows best, huh?

45
00:05:16,951 --> 00:05:17,952
Don't worry.

46
00:05:19,554 --> 00:05:21,321
We'll find these killers.

47
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:27,595
You boys are awful quiet.

48
00:05:30,264 --> 00:05:31,833
I'm not getting into it,
Carol.

49
00:05:32,733 --> 00:05:34,035
Come on, Sheriff.

50
00:05:34,101 --> 00:05:36,070
We all want to hear
what you know

51
00:05:36,137 --> 00:05:38,105
about who killed
that young couple.

52
00:05:39,807 --> 00:05:41,142
The girl didn't die.

53
00:05:45,345 --> 00:05:46,747
Oh, I heard they both died,

54
00:05:46,814 --> 00:05:48,348
that they left
this world together.

55
00:05:49,283 --> 00:05:50,952
Nope.

56
00:05:51,018 --> 00:05:52,019
She's gonna be okay.

57
00:05:56,023 --> 00:05:57,225
You want to hear my theory?

58
00:06:00,094 --> 00:06:01,062
She did it.

59
00:06:01,863 --> 00:06:03,798
The girl.

60
00:06:03,865 --> 00:06:06,634
Probably for some
big insurance money.

61
00:06:06,701 --> 00:06:09,971
Gorgeous hair,
but a dark heart.

62
00:06:10,872 --> 00:06:11,873
Well...

63
00:06:13,207 --> 00:06:15,243
sounds like you done cracked
the case, Jazz.

64
00:06:15,309 --> 00:06:16,911
I'm just saying.

65
00:06:16,978 --> 00:06:18,646
You never know
what a killer looks like.

66
00:06:30,892 --> 00:06:32,193
Is Sally there?

67
00:06:36,297 --> 00:06:37,331
Can I come in?

68
00:06:41,002 --> 00:06:42,003
Got your ball.

69
00:06:48,242 --> 00:06:49,377
Go fetch.

70
00:06:56,083 --> 00:06:57,118
Come on.

71
00:07:55,475 --> 00:07:57,078
<i>Do you want</i>
<i>to play cards?</i>

72
00:08:06,153 --> 00:08:08,255
I have an idea.

73
00:08:08,322 --> 00:08:11,025
Why don't I play you
your favorite song?

74
00:08:47,294 --> 00:08:48,796
Maya?

75
00:08:49,630 --> 00:08:50,998
It's me, Nurse Danica.

76
00:08:52,033 --> 00:08:53,300
I have your pain meds.

77
00:08:53,367 --> 00:08:54,402
Thanks.

78
00:08:55,636 --> 00:08:56,637
Here you go.

79
00:08:57,671 --> 00:08:58,672
That's it.

80
00:09:03,778 --> 00:09:04,945
How you feeling?

81
00:09:05,012 --> 00:09:06,013
I'm okay.

82
00:09:09,817 --> 00:09:11,419
Who's Tamara?

83
00:09:14,523 --> 00:09:15,823
I didn't really know her.

84
00:09:16,724 --> 00:09:18,059
Just the story.

85
00:09:20,561 --> 00:09:22,997
It's just an old ghost story
that people tell here.

86
00:09:24,732 --> 00:09:26,200
Try not to think
about that, okay?

87
00:09:27,334 --> 00:09:28,335
Get some rest.

88
00:10:06,173 --> 00:10:07,141
Hi, Maya.

89
00:10:14,748 --> 00:10:16,650
I knew you wouldn't leave me.

90
00:10:17,384 --> 00:10:18,587
Never.

91
00:10:55,456 --> 00:10:56,924
<i>Hey, I'm so sorry</i>
<i>we're stuck here.</i>

92
00:10:56,991 --> 00:10:58,092
<i>I want to get you</i>
<i>out of there.</i>

93
00:10:58,159 --> 00:10:59,860
<i>We are working</i>
<i>on a private EMT,</i>

94
00:10:59,927 --> 00:11:02,062
<i>hopefully today,</i>
<i>which will pick you up</i>

95
00:11:02,129 --> 00:11:03,430
<i>and take you</i>
<i>to Portland Hospital.</i>

96
00:11:03,497 --> 00:11:05,866
<i>Howard and I</i>
<i>will meet you there.</i>

97
00:11:05,933 --> 00:11:08,035
<i>I love you so much.</i>
<i>We'll be there soon.</i>

98
00:11:08,102 --> 00:11:10,505
<i>It's gonna be okay. Okay. Bye.</i>

99
00:11:18,012 --> 00:11:19,013
Debbie?

100
00:11:21,448 --> 00:11:22,449
Debbie?

101
00:11:25,352 --> 00:11:26,353
Hello?

102
00:11:28,822 --> 00:11:30,625
<i>Is Tamara here?</i>

103
00:11:33,761 --> 00:11:35,963
Who the fuck are you?

104
00:11:36,931 --> 00:11:37,898
Shit!

105
00:11:38,966 --> 00:11:39,967
Help!

106
00:11:47,007 --> 00:11:48,242
Fuck you!

107
00:11:48,309 --> 00:11:49,310
Get off!

108
00:11:57,218 --> 00:11:58,953
Shit.

109
00:13:54,902 --> 00:13:55,869
Fuck.

110
00:18:29,711 --> 00:18:30,778
No.

111
00:20:43,410 --> 00:20:45,245
Shit!

112
00:20:49,416 --> 00:20:51,119
Fuck!

113
00:23:15,630 --> 00:23:17,064
Please. Please...

114
00:26:57,384 --> 00:26:58,385
Freeze.

115
00:27:10,030 --> 00:27:11,132
Please.

116
00:27:11,198 --> 00:27:12,333
Please, I just need
to use your phone

117
00:27:12,399 --> 00:27:13,901
to call the police. Please.

118
00:27:13,968 --> 00:27:15,504
-There are people trying to...
-Sheriff ain't gonna help ya.

119
00:27:17,972 --> 00:27:19,006
Why?

120
00:27:19,073 --> 00:27:20,374
Because he...

121
00:27:30,651 --> 00:27:31,652
Shit!

122
00:30:11,111 --> 00:30:12,246
Oh, shit!

123
00:30:31,498 --> 00:30:32,734
Open the...

124
00:31:28,790 --> 00:31:29,758
Maya?

125
00:31:36,196 --> 00:31:37,898
Here. Put this on.

126
00:31:37,965 --> 00:31:39,701
That's Chris' jacket.
It's warm.

127
00:31:40,300 --> 00:31:41,669
She's ex-military.

128
00:31:41,736 --> 00:31:43,103
Three years in the service.

129
00:31:45,540 --> 00:31:48,175
Look, Maya. I'm really worried
about your stitches.

130
00:31:49,076 --> 00:31:50,244
If your wound opens up,

131
00:31:50,310 --> 00:31:52,446
you could lose
a lot of blood and die.

132
00:32:03,023 --> 00:32:04,291
Please.

133
00:32:04,358 --> 00:32:06,861
Please. Just drive.
Please, just drive. Please.

134
00:32:10,230 --> 00:32:11,265
What are you doing?

135
00:32:12,199 --> 00:32:13,835
Open the door! Open it.

136
00:32:13,902 --> 00:32:16,003
Let me out!
Let me out of here!

137
00:32:16,069 --> 00:32:18,005
-Maya?
-Let me out of here!

138
00:32:18,071 --> 00:32:19,874
-Let me out of here!
-Maya!

139
00:32:19,940 --> 00:32:21,108
You said you would help me!

140
00:32:21,175 --> 00:32:23,210
-I am helping you.
-Let me out!

141
00:32:23,277 --> 00:32:25,279
-Open it!
-Maya. Maya. Maya.

142
00:32:25,345 --> 00:32:26,681
Let's take her
back to the house.

143
00:32:26,748 --> 00:32:28,015
-Let me out!
-Maya!

144
00:32:28,081 --> 00:32:29,316
Let me the fuck out!
Open the fucking door!

145
00:32:29,383 --> 00:32:31,285
-Calm down.
-Let me out!

146
00:32:31,351 --> 00:32:32,520
-Okay, calm down!
-Hey!

147
00:32:32,587 --> 00:32:35,322
Let me
the fuck out of here!

148
00:32:35,389 --> 00:32:37,792
Hey. Hey! Hey, hey!

149
00:32:37,859 --> 00:32:40,829
Relax! Relax! Calm down.

150
00:32:43,263 --> 00:32:44,298
Relax.

151
00:32:46,233 --> 00:32:48,268
I'll take you back
to our house. Okay?

152
00:32:49,136 --> 00:32:51,472
It's safe. I promise.

153
00:32:53,307 --> 00:32:54,475
Look. I'll clean your wound

154
00:32:54,542 --> 00:32:56,845
and we'll figure out
the rest tomorrow. Okay?

155
00:33:09,724 --> 00:33:12,627
Okay. Your house.

156
00:33:22,770 --> 00:33:25,072
<i>Now,</i>
<i>look to the Lord and unto me.</i>

157
00:33:25,138 --> 00:33:29,276
<i>We will serve the Lord.</i>
<i>Depart from Satan.</i>

158
00:33:29,343 --> 00:33:31,378
<i>Refuse to give in to him</i>

159
00:33:31,445 --> 00:33:33,380
<i>by standing strong</i>
<i>in thy faith.</i>

160
00:33:33,447 --> 00:33:37,084
<i>The scripture says</i>
<i>when we see evil...</i>

161
00:33:45,492 --> 00:33:47,394
Oh, gosh,
she's fucked up.

162
00:33:49,697 --> 00:33:50,865
Is that...

163
00:33:50,932 --> 00:33:52,634
What the fuck
are they doing here?

164
00:33:55,670 --> 00:33:57,437
<i>...for human nature.</i>

165
00:33:57,505 --> 00:33:59,406
<i>Because human nature</i>
<i>is wicked.</i>

166
00:34:00,274 --> 00:34:02,209
<i>Human nature is evil.</i>

167
00:34:02,276 --> 00:34:04,411
<i>There's a reason</i>
<i>it needs rebirth,</i>

168
00:34:04,478 --> 00:34:06,280
<i>it needs redemption.</i>

169
00:34:06,346 --> 00:34:09,751
<i>The devil came to Eve</i>
<i>in the Garden of Eden.</i>

170
00:34:09,817 --> 00:34:11,986
<i>He came and whispered</i>
<i>in her ear</i>

171
00:34:12,052 --> 00:34:13,788
<i>through the serpent and said,</i>

172
00:34:13,855 --> 00:34:17,224
<i>"Come with me.</i>
<i>I will show you the way."</i>

173
00:34:17,291 --> 00:34:19,092
<i>That's the way to Hell.</i>

174
00:34:20,460 --> 00:34:22,864
<i>Jesus told her of the danger</i>
<i>of the hellfire.</i>

175
00:34:27,702 --> 00:34:29,169
Maya, meet
our idiot roommates.

176
00:34:29,236 --> 00:34:30,705
-Gregory.
-Wayne.

177
00:34:34,909 --> 00:34:36,511
Why are you two walking
down in the middle of the road

178
00:34:36,578 --> 00:34:38,746
in a rainstorm?
Where's your truck?

179
00:34:38,813 --> 00:34:40,280
Perry's bar.

180
00:34:41,516 --> 00:34:43,317
Dickstain here
forgot the keys,

181
00:34:43,383 --> 00:34:44,752
and by the time
he realized it,

182
00:34:44,819 --> 00:34:46,788
Perry locked
the fuckin' place up.

183
00:34:48,756 --> 00:34:50,525
So you're the one
everybody's talking about?

184
00:34:50,592 --> 00:34:53,761
<i>He says,</i>
<i>"Depart from me, you cursed,</i>

185
00:34:53,828 --> 00:34:57,464
<i>"into everlasting fire</i>
<i>prepared for the devil,</i>

186
00:34:57,532 --> 00:34:58,566
<i>"and his angels."</i>

187
00:35:11,746 --> 00:35:14,314
<i>So there,</i>
<i>in the great book of Matthew,</i>

188
00:35:14,381 --> 00:35:18,886
<i>Jesus' words call out</i>
<i>about the end, about evil.</i>

189
00:35:18,953 --> 00:35:21,990
<i>His eyes watch in secret</i>
<i>for his victims.</i>

190
00:35:22,056 --> 00:35:24,826
<i>He lies in wait</i>
<i>to catch the innocent.</i>

191
00:35:24,892 --> 00:35:28,362
<i>He catches them</i>
<i>and drags them off in his net.</i>

192
00:35:28,428 --> 00:35:30,197
<i>Turn away from this Satan!</i>

193
00:35:30,263 --> 00:35:31,833
<i>Repent for your sins.</i>

194
00:35:33,467 --> 00:35:36,004
<i>I'm searching</i>
<i>for the way of life</i>

195
00:35:36,070 --> 00:35:37,672
<i>and the way of death.</i>

196
00:35:37,739 --> 00:35:40,642
<i>The way of Heaven</i>
<i>or the way of Hell.</i>

197
00:35:40,708 --> 00:35:42,142
<i>The way of light...</i>

198
00:35:42,209 --> 00:35:43,310
<i>...or eternal fire.</i>

199
00:35:44,112 --> 00:35:45,245
<i>Which way are you on?</i>

200
00:35:45,312 --> 00:35:46,648
What the fuck
are you looking at?

201
00:35:46,714 --> 00:35:48,583
<i>Jesus said,</i>
<i>"I am the way.</i>

202
00:35:48,650 --> 00:35:52,720
<i>"I am the way.</i>
<i>I am the only way."</i>

203
00:35:52,787 --> 00:35:56,758
<i>Behold, open your soul</i>
<i>and receive Christ.</i>

204
00:35:56,824 --> 00:35:59,159
<i>Don't come to this place.</i>

205
00:35:59,226 --> 00:36:01,029
<i>Break thou the arm</i>
<i>of the wicked</i>

206
00:36:01,095 --> 00:36:03,497
<i>and the evil man.</i>

207
00:36:03,564 --> 00:36:07,101
<i>Jesus said, "I call Heaven</i>
<i>and Earth to record..."</i>

208
00:36:09,469 --> 00:36:11,906
<i>"I've set before thee</i>
<i>life and death."</i>

209
00:36:11,973 --> 00:36:14,374
<i>"Blessing and cursing."</i>

210
00:36:14,441 --> 00:36:17,578
<i>Telling us there shall be</i>
<i>great tribulations</i>

211
00:36:17,645 --> 00:36:21,248
<i>such as was not since</i>
<i>the beginning of the world</i>

212
00:36:21,314 --> 00:36:23,718
<i>to this time</i>
<i>nor will ever be again.</i>

213
00:36:25,318 --> 00:36:28,221
<i>Except those days</i>
<i>should be shortened.</i>

214
00:36:28,288 --> 00:36:32,627
<i>There should be no man saved</i>
<i>but for the sake of the world,</i>

215
00:36:32,694 --> 00:36:34,562
<i>of all mankind.</i>

216
00:36:34,629 --> 00:36:38,533
<i>Those days will be shortened.</i>

217
00:36:38,599 --> 00:36:41,102
<i>All you have to do</i>
<i>is pick up the phone,</i>

218
00:36:41,169 --> 00:36:43,971
<i>and call the number</i>
<i>you see on your TV.</i>

219
00:36:44,038 --> 00:36:47,642
<i>And talk with you</i>
<i>about this wonderful decision.</i>

220
00:36:47,709 --> 00:36:51,311
<i>The decision to take the Lord</i>
<i>into your heart today.</i>

221
00:36:52,547 --> 00:36:53,748
-What the...
-Maya!

222
00:36:58,351 --> 00:36:59,787
Maya!

223
00:36:59,854 --> 00:37:01,321
Come back!

224
00:37:01,388 --> 00:37:02,389
Maya,
what are you doing?

225
00:37:03,691 --> 00:37:04,792
What the hell's
wrong with you?

226
00:37:04,859 --> 00:37:05,893
Come back in the car.

227
00:38:23,070 --> 00:38:25,305
If we don't
find anything here,

228
00:38:25,372 --> 00:38:27,141
let's go back to the station.

229
00:38:27,208 --> 00:38:28,242
Yeah, sounds good.

230
00:40:57,525 --> 00:40:59,327
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

231
00:41:05,766 --> 00:41:06,834
Fuck!

232
00:41:39,233 --> 00:41:40,634
Fuck, fuck, fuck.

233
00:47:41,696 --> 00:47:43,397
Fuck! Please.

234
00:47:43,464 --> 00:47:45,366
Oh, my God. Fuck!

235
00:52:14,769 --> 00:52:16,938
<i>Hey, no, wait. No, wait.</i>

236
00:52:37,091 --> 00:52:38,993
I taught them to come to me.

237
00:52:39,060 --> 00:52:40,662
Gotta put it
right up to his nose.

238
00:52:41,294 --> 00:52:43,330
Yeah, like that.

239
00:52:43,397 --> 00:52:46,500
I'm gonna teach the boars
to do lots of things.

240
00:52:46,567 --> 00:52:48,168
Yeah, I think you will.

241
00:52:55,308 --> 00:52:57,145
Ow. Ow. My ankle.

242
00:53:05,586 --> 00:53:07,021
Hey, are you okay?

243
00:53:07,088 --> 00:53:10,058
Yeah, I'll be fine.
Just a little dust.

244
00:53:11,324 --> 00:53:12,694
It doesn't look too bad.

245
00:53:14,095 --> 00:53:15,630
See?

246
00:53:15,697 --> 00:53:16,898
Here. Let me help you up.

247
00:54:39,881 --> 00:54:40,882
Thanks, Jimbo.

248
00:54:44,519 --> 00:54:46,286
Crew finished
searching the woods.

249
00:54:46,353 --> 00:54:48,089
Jesus, Tommy,
keep your voice down.

250
00:54:52,093 --> 00:54:53,628
Maya ain't in the woods.

251
00:54:53,694 --> 00:54:56,296
-She's a missing person.
-Correction.

252
00:54:56,363 --> 00:54:57,698
Her whereabouts are unknown.

253
00:54:57,765 --> 00:55:00,168
She's not an MP
for another 24 hours.

254
00:55:02,236 --> 00:55:03,237
Look, maybe...

255
00:55:04,471 --> 00:55:07,175
maybe we should
call in the State, the FBI.

256
00:55:07,241 --> 00:55:08,475
Calling in the cavalry

257
00:55:08,543 --> 00:55:10,711
doesn't end well
for guys like you and me.

258
00:55:10,778 --> 00:55:12,580
They'll second-guess
everything.

259
00:55:12,647 --> 00:55:14,148
Open up our files.

260
00:55:15,583 --> 00:55:16,717
You want the Feds looking

261
00:55:16,784 --> 00:55:17,919
into why you didn't
press charges

262
00:55:17,985 --> 00:55:19,352
against the widow
Saunders now?

263
00:55:19,419 --> 00:55:21,122
Man, me and her
didn't start up.

264
00:58:12,793 --> 00:58:13,995
Mmm.

265
00:59:45,419 --> 00:59:48,055
What the fuck!

266
00:59:48,889 --> 00:59:50,658
Jesus.

267
00:59:50,724 --> 00:59:51,959
I'm not gonna hurt ya.

268
00:59:53,060 --> 00:59:54,462
I'm here because
of the lack of response

269
00:59:54,529 --> 00:59:55,530
by the sheriff's department

270
00:59:55,596 --> 00:59:57,431
to all the murders
in the area.

271
00:59:57,498 --> 00:59:59,366
You must be Maya.
Are you okay?

272
00:59:59,433 --> 01:00:00,968
Do I look okay?

273
01:00:01,035 --> 01:00:02,537
No.

274
01:00:02,603 --> 01:00:04,672
Maya, I'm here to help.

275
01:00:04,738 --> 01:00:08,042
Billy Buford, Oregon State
Police Internal Affairs.

276
01:00:08,109 --> 01:00:10,512
-Do you have a car?
-Yeah, it's outside.

277
01:00:10,579 --> 01:00:12,379
Get me the fuck out of here.

278
01:00:14,215 --> 01:00:15,216
Okay.

279
01:00:18,919 --> 01:00:19,954
Nice and easy.

280
01:00:24,091 --> 01:00:25,659
-Yeah?
-Yeah. Thank you.

281
01:00:41,408 --> 01:00:42,943
Fuck! Fuck!

282
01:00:54,155 --> 01:00:55,624
What the fuck?

283
01:01:29,690 --> 01:01:31,225
Fuck!

284
01:01:43,804 --> 01:01:45,339
Fuck. Okay.

285
01:01:59,320 --> 01:02:02,557
Help. Is anybody home?
Please, help me.

286
01:02:02,624 --> 01:02:04,058
Help me, please.

287
01:02:31,919 --> 01:02:32,920
God.

288
01:04:30,170 --> 01:04:32,206
<i>We are evil.</i>

289
01:04:32,272 --> 01:04:34,809
<i>It warns us that</i>
<i>you shall be driven mad</i>

290
01:04:34,875 --> 01:04:36,910
<i>by the sight of what you see.</i>

291
01:04:36,977 --> 01:04:39,514
<i>The most evil of this world.</i>

292
01:04:40,815 --> 01:04:43,384
<i>"The sins of my mother</i>
<i>conceived me,"</i>

293
01:04:43,450 --> 01:04:44,786
<i>David said.</i>

294
01:04:44,853 --> 01:04:48,623
<i>We are all sinners</i>
<i>and we were born in sin.</i>

295
01:04:48,690 --> 01:04:52,827
<i>And then when we grow up,</i>
<i>we make the choice to sin.</i>

296
01:04:52,893 --> 01:04:54,328
<i>The Bible tells us that</i>

297
01:04:54,395 --> 01:04:57,297
<i>there's a burning Hell</i>
<i>in the human heart.</i>

298
01:04:57,364 --> 01:05:00,668
<i>And that people who seem to be</i>
<i>good and wholesome in time</i>

299
01:05:00,735 --> 01:05:03,303
<i>may be changed</i>
<i>into vicious killers,</i>

300
01:05:03,370 --> 01:05:07,509
<i>into murderous maniacs</i>
<i>just like that.</i>

301
01:05:07,575 --> 01:05:09,977
<i>We all know</i>
<i>the story of a woman.</i>

302
01:05:10,043 --> 01:05:11,345
<i>A good woman.</i>

303
01:05:11,412 --> 01:05:13,782
<i>A beautiful woman</i>
<i>whose husband was...</i>

304
01:05:13,848 --> 01:05:17,251
You're out of the woods.
Congratulations.

305
01:05:17,317 --> 01:05:19,086
<i>...hardly</i>
<i>any reason at all,</i>

306
01:05:19,153 --> 01:05:21,021
<i>while he was asleep,</i>

307
01:05:21,088 --> 01:05:23,123
<i>she shot him, killed him dead.</i>

308
01:05:23,190 --> 01:05:25,025
How do you like my tattoo?

309
01:05:25,092 --> 01:05:27,060
Um... I...

310
01:05:28,162 --> 01:05:29,263
You don't like it?

311
01:05:33,500 --> 01:05:35,269
I knew you were gonna have
a tough time making friends

312
01:05:35,335 --> 01:05:36,403
around here.

313
01:05:38,740 --> 01:05:40,240
A lot of us have the same one.

314
01:05:44,077 --> 01:05:47,682
Got it on a teen church trip

315
01:05:47,749 --> 01:05:48,917
a few years back.

316
01:05:55,857 --> 01:05:57,291
You know how teens are...

317
01:05:58,793 --> 01:06:00,327
the sex and the...

318
01:06:01,361 --> 01:06:02,564
the booze.

319
01:06:05,098 --> 01:06:06,333
Cheap tattoos.

320
01:06:11,305 --> 01:06:12,406
That's cool.

321
01:06:13,875 --> 01:06:14,843
Excuse me.

322
01:06:17,879 --> 01:06:19,379
Stuff didn't
line up earlier, but...

323
01:06:19,446 --> 01:06:20,447
No, I don't know.

324
01:06:21,816 --> 01:06:22,983
You're up.

325
01:06:23,050 --> 01:06:25,018
Leave her alone,
Gregory.

326
01:06:25,085 --> 01:06:26,821
I'm not doing nothing,
I'm just...

327
01:06:27,889 --> 01:06:29,356
welcoming our guest.

328
01:06:30,224 --> 01:06:31,492
She's all yours.

329
01:06:36,430 --> 01:06:37,431
Fuck!

330
01:06:40,234 --> 01:06:42,871
Look, don't take it
personally, okay?

331
01:06:42,937 --> 01:06:46,741
-He's like that to everyone.
-Arrogant prick.

332
01:06:46,808 --> 01:06:49,577
Grandparents left him money
and an old sailboat.

333
01:06:49,644 --> 01:06:51,713
Still has the sailboat.

334
01:06:51,779 --> 01:06:53,848
And he still acts
like he owns the town.

335
01:06:55,015 --> 01:06:57,084
He's harmless, though.

336
01:06:57,150 --> 01:07:01,088
Girl, I have done
some crazy shit in my life,

337
01:07:01,154 --> 01:07:02,624
but jumping out
a moving car...

338
01:07:02,690 --> 01:07:05,092
It's suicidal.

339
01:07:05,158 --> 01:07:07,194
Look, you're lucky
to still be in one piece.

340
01:07:09,296 --> 01:07:10,532
Let's get you back to bed.

341
01:07:12,967 --> 01:07:14,334
So you can rest.

342
01:07:23,443 --> 01:07:25,145
It's your phone.

343
01:07:25,212 --> 01:07:27,481
I rescued it from
the hospital's lost and found.

344
01:08:16,764 --> 01:08:18,298
Hello?

345
01:08:22,570 --> 01:08:24,005
Excuse me?

346
01:08:24,072 --> 01:08:25,439
I need to get some gas.

347
01:08:36,350 --> 01:08:38,586
Shit!

348
01:08:39,186 --> 01:08:40,220
You scared me.

349
01:08:41,756 --> 01:08:43,091
I'll turn on the pump.

350
01:08:49,530 --> 01:08:52,834
Hey, Gander Street
is which way from here?

351
01:08:57,270 --> 01:08:58,573
You going to the lake house?

352
01:09:00,108 --> 01:09:01,241
Uh-huh.

353
01:09:02,076 --> 01:09:03,077
What for?

354
01:09:04,078 --> 01:09:05,178
Picking someone up.

355
01:09:08,049 --> 01:09:09,316
Mmm-hmm.

356
01:09:14,956 --> 01:09:15,990
Yeah...

357
01:09:17,558 --> 01:09:18,626
Just the gas, then.

358
01:10:10,111 --> 01:10:11,311
You were, uh...

359
01:10:11,378 --> 01:10:13,181
you were stabbed in the...

360
01:10:14,314 --> 01:10:16,050
stomach, right?

361
01:10:20,154 --> 01:10:21,556
Did you think
you were gonna die?

362
01:10:34,869 --> 01:10:36,204
What were you thinking about?

363
01:10:44,145 --> 01:10:45,113
Time.

364
01:10:50,585 --> 01:10:52,385
How slowly it was moving.

365
01:10:54,722 --> 01:10:55,923
How fast it all felt.

366
01:11:00,561 --> 01:11:01,963
How little I had left.

367
01:11:07,068 --> 01:11:08,636
What'd you want
to do about it?

368
01:11:18,546 --> 01:11:21,082
In that moment,
I would have done anything...

369
01:11:22,850 --> 01:11:23,818
to kill him.

370
01:11:40,268 --> 01:11:41,301
Pretty lucky.

371
01:11:43,771 --> 01:11:44,772
Am I?

372
01:11:46,140 --> 01:11:47,241
Yeah.

373
01:11:48,876 --> 01:11:50,244
This shit's been, uh...

374
01:11:53,147 --> 01:11:54,682
it's been going on for years.

375
01:11:59,120 --> 01:12:00,755
You're the only one
that survived.

376
01:12:04,491 --> 01:12:05,726
How many others?

377
01:12:14,135 --> 01:12:16,537
Ten? Fifteen?

378
01:12:18,573 --> 01:12:19,640
Does it matter?

379
01:12:23,443 --> 01:12:24,444
Why?

380
01:12:30,450 --> 01:12:31,953
Does there have to be a why?

381
01:12:41,629 --> 01:12:43,631
Gregory? Gregory?

382
01:12:45,600 --> 01:12:48,336
Damn. Bitch.

383
01:12:51,305 --> 01:12:52,306
Fuck.

384
01:13:27,375 --> 01:13:28,910
-Gregory.
-God, leave me alone.

385
01:13:28,976 --> 01:13:30,111
Don't just
walk away from me.

386
01:13:30,177 --> 01:13:31,212
I'm trying to talk to you.

387
01:13:31,979 --> 01:13:33,180
Why are you harassing her?

388
01:13:33,247 --> 01:13:34,515
Go back in the house
and yell at me,

389
01:13:34,582 --> 01:13:35,850
-I'll let you...
-You're hammered.

390
01:13:35,917 --> 01:13:37,518
You're drunk.

391
01:13:37,585 --> 01:13:38,753
Good observation.

392
01:13:38,819 --> 01:13:40,288
Where are you going?
You can't drive.

393
01:13:42,189 --> 01:13:44,191
Just listen to me.
I told you to leave her alone,

394
01:13:44,258 --> 01:13:45,793
why don't you
just leave her alone?

395
01:13:47,662 --> 01:13:49,630
Get out
of my fucking face.

396
01:13:49,697 --> 01:13:51,132
Calm down.

397
01:13:53,433 --> 01:13:54,635
Get the fuck
out of the way!

398
01:14:16,456 --> 01:14:18,159
Fuck.

399
01:15:00,835 --> 01:15:03,404

400
01:15:03,471 --> 01:15:06,073

Drive. Drive, drive. Drive.

405
01:22:31,051 --> 01:22:32,286
'Cause you're here.

406
01:25:25,258 --> 01:25:26,628
Come get me.

407
01:25:37,071 --> 01:25:38,072
Is Tamara here?

408
01:25:57,091 --> 01:25:59,093
Wait. Do it again.

409
01:26:03,998 --> 01:26:05,332
I'm waiting.

410
01:26:07,434 --> 01:26:09,169
I'm waiting.

411
01:26:20,247 --> 01:26:21,516
Is Tamara here?

<i>Look like</i>
<i>you've been through hell.</i>

413
01:30:43,678 --> 01:30:44,779
<i>I know where they are.</i>

414
01:30:48,448 --> 01:30:49,449
<i>Where are they?</i>

415
01:31:00,261 --> 01:31:03,731
<i>No, no! No! Stop!</i>

416
01:31:03,798 --> 01:31:06,466
<i>Stop! No! No! No!</i>

417
01:31:09,136 --> 01:31:10,171
See you soon.
