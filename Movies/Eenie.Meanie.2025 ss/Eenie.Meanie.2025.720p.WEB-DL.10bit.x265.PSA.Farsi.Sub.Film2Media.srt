16
00:01:11,458 --> 00:01:13,959
<i>What the fuck are you looking

17
00:01:14,042 --> 00:01:16,375

22
00:01:27,833 --> 00:01:29,875
I worked last week.
It's my money.

23
00:01:29,958 --> 00:01:33,167
Oh, great, yeah. One week. You
worked one week. Oh, you know what?

24
00:01:33,250 --> 00:01:36,459
How is it that you get to spend all
your work money on your bullshit,

25
00:01:36,542 --> 00:01:37,917
when I give everything I make

26
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,584
to you and Edie?

27
00:01:39,667 --> 00:01:41,625
I'm not taking you
back to that shithole.

28
00:01:42,125 --> 00:01:45,584
-Who the fuck was that guy in there?
-It was Chico.

29
00:01:45,667 --> 00:01:48,000
-Chico? Who's Chico?
-No, uh, Rich, or...

30
00:01:48,083 --> 00:01:50,875
-Ri... Rich? Rich Pacheco?
-Whatever.

31
00:01:50,958 --> 00:01:55,084
That was Rich Pache... The jagoff that
robbed the Sevs with a butter knife?

32
00:01:55,167 --> 00:01:57,375
-He's harmless.
-No, he tried to kill a cashier.

33
00:01:57,458 --> 00:01:58,459
But he didn't.

34
00:01:58,542 --> 00:02:00,834
Because he used a fucking butter
knife. Which makes him an idiot.

35
00:02:00,917 --> 00:02:04,333
-Stop socializing with stupid junkies.
-Okay.

36
00:02:07,333 --> 00:02:09,042
-That's crazy.
-"Junkies."

37
00:02:09,125 --> 00:02:10,625
Thought he was in jail.

38
00:02:21,792 --> 00:02:23,375
You know, I didn't
ask you to police me.

39
00:02:23,458 --> 00:02:25,292
-Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Fine.
-Jesus Christ already.

40
00:02:25,375 --> 00:02:27,334
Thank you for filling
in for my dead dad.

41
00:02:27,417 --> 00:02:30,084
'Cause I was really missing
having someone up my ass 24-7.

42
00:02:30,167 --> 00:02:32,584
Well, obviously it didn't
work the first time.

43
00:02:32,667 --> 00:02:34,875
And what makes you think
it's gonna work now, hmm?

44
00:02:34,958 --> 00:02:39,667
Are you even... What
a pain in the ass.

45
00:02:40,167 --> 00:02:41,167
-Guys.
-What?

46
00:02:43,417 --> 00:02:44,334
Fuck!

47
00:02:44,417 --> 00:02:46,625
-What do I do? What do I do?
-No, no, no. No. It's fine, honey.

48
00:02:46,708 --> 00:02:48,334
-Just calm down.
-It's not fucking fine.

49
00:02:48,417 --> 00:02:50,250
No, we'll just... let's just tell
him that we've been drinking.

50
00:02:50,333 --> 00:02:52,459
-She's 14.
-Yeah, he'll think we're being smart.

51
00:02:52,542 --> 00:02:55,292
Shut it, Kat. Hey, Edie,
Edie, do not pull over.

52
00:02:55,375 --> 00:02:56,375
I'm pulling over.

53
00:02:56,458 --> 00:02:59,542
Edie! Do not fucking
pull over. Oh, my God.

54
00:03:09,458 --> 00:03:11,417
Okay, you know what? I'm gonna
hide it. That's what I'm gonna do.

55
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:14,917
-Shut it, Kat. Edie. Look at me.
-I'm just gonna...

56
00:03:16,458 --> 00:03:17,458
Look at me.

57
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:23,333
Your mom has a shit
ton of coke on her.

58
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:28,417
She bought a bunch of coke
from Rich fucking Pacheco,

59
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:30,125
and if you don't get us
out of here right now...

60
00:03:30,208 --> 00:03:31,417
Okay, you know what?
You're overreact...

61
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:33,792
You... You don't think he's gonna
pull us out of the car? Huh?

62
00:03:33,875 --> 00:03:35,875
When he finds out
that she's fucking 14?

63
00:03:36,375 --> 00:03:40,959
Edie, if you don't get us the fuck out of
here right now, your ma is going to jail.

64
00:03:41,042 --> 00:03:43,000
-Mark.
-It's your third strike, babe.

65
00:03:45,958 --> 00:03:48,917
Edie. Look at me.

66
00:03:52,583 --> 00:03:53,583
It's okay.

67
00:03:54,792 --> 00:03:55,792
Now.

68
00:03:58,833 --> 00:04:00,875
Just like I taught ya.

69
00:04:03,083 --> 00:04:04,417
Punch it.

70
00:04:24,958 --> 00:04:26,792
Hey!

71
00:04:26,875 --> 00:04:28,417
I gotta go!

72
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:30,375
-What? No, no, no, no, no. Fifteen.
-Come on!

73
00:04:30,458 --> 00:04:33,084
-Fifteen more minutes.
-I've got work in, like seven hours.

74
00:04:33,167 --> 00:04:34,459
So? It's my birthday.

75
00:04:34,542 --> 00:04:35,750
Yo ass used to be fun.

76
00:04:35,833 --> 00:04:39,542
Oh, come on. I still have to study.
Tori's gonna stay. She's fun.

77
00:04:39,625 --> 00:04:42,334
Oh, no. No, no, no.
Tori is too fun.

78
00:04:42,417 --> 00:04:45,125
Look, I got a 2:00 a.m. last
call with that crazy-ass bitch.

79
00:04:45,208 --> 00:04:46,875
So, no, I'm good. Yeah.

80
00:04:46,958 --> 00:04:48,375
Okay, yes. Stay away from her.

81
00:04:48,458 --> 00:04:49,792
-Yeah. I'm good.
-Thank you.

82
00:04:49,875 --> 00:04:52,250
No, no, no. You don't have to do... I
know how tight your shit is right now.

83
00:04:52,333 --> 00:04:54,625
Oh, no. It's your birthday. You're
not paying on your birthday. Come on.

84
00:04:54,708 --> 00:04:56,000
-Declined.
-Shit!

85
00:04:56,083 --> 00:04:57,209
It's fine. It's fine.

86
00:04:57,292 --> 00:04:58,709
My tuition probably
went through.

87
00:04:58,792 --> 00:05:00,125
-I got you.
-Uh.

88
00:05:00,208 --> 00:05:02,167
No, no, no. Thank you,
thank you, but we're good.

89
00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:03,750
You gonna let your friend
pay on her birthday?

90
00:05:03,833 --> 00:05:05,750
-Oh...
-You can pay me back with your number.

91
00:05:05,833 --> 00:05:07,292
She said we're good.

92
00:05:07,375 --> 00:05:09,417
Why you stoppin' me from
blessin' your girl's life?

93
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:11,959
Yo breath. Oh, my God. You
done cleared my damn sinuses.

94
00:05:12,042 --> 00:05:13,542
Mmm, yeah, okay.

95
00:05:13,625 --> 00:05:16,167
Wow. He's still here.
He has confidence.

96
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:17,792
He doesn't have a mint.

97
00:05:17,875 --> 00:05:20,959
I'm sorry. She's
really mean. I'm sorry.

98
00:05:21,042 --> 00:05:22,167
You don't look sorry.

99
00:05:22,250 --> 00:05:25,125
-I-I'll try. I'll try. I'll try.
-Get you a mint. Get you a mint, boo.

100
00:05:25,208 --> 00:05:26,459
Bye, Doug.

101
00:05:26,542 --> 00:05:27,917
-You doing too much.
-Yeah.

102
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,000
School, work, studyin' in
the middle of the night.

103
00:05:31,083 --> 00:05:33,792
-Definitely feels like too much.
-Yeah.

104
00:05:33,875 --> 00:05:35,583
Well, I'm proud of you.

105
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:38,750
And you still ain't called that bum-ass,
broke-ass motherfucker in, what now?

106
00:05:38,833 --> 00:05:41,750
-Hey. You promised. Come on.
-I ain't promise shit on my birthday.

107
00:05:41,833 --> 00:05:44,042
I could talk shit about
that bum-ass on my birthday.

108
00:05:44,125 --> 00:05:46,584
It's been seven-and-a-half
months now, so...

109
00:05:46,667 --> 00:05:48,709
That's good. For real.

110
00:05:48,792 --> 00:05:51,209
That's a long-ass time to be
with somebody and then walk away.

111
00:05:51,292 --> 00:05:53,000
I know how hard that shit is.

112
00:05:55,875 --> 00:05:58,375
Ooh, this motherfucker.

113
00:05:58,875 --> 00:06:00,042
Yo, call me.

114
00:06:00,125 --> 00:06:01,792
Oh.

115
00:06:01,875 --> 00:06:03,667
-Well, well, well.
-Ain't you got work?

116
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:06,250
Standing outside a
dealership, floppin' around.

117
00:06:06,333 --> 00:06:07,875
I'm sorry about her.

118
00:06:07,958 --> 00:06:08,959
You still don't look sorry.

119
00:06:09,042 --> 00:06:10,792
Well, you're not making
it very easy, man.

120
00:06:10,875 --> 00:06:12,500
Looking like Jack
Skellington and shit.

121
00:06:12,583 --> 00:06:15,167
Goddamn!

122
00:06:19,625 --> 00:06:21,084
You gon' fuck him
'cause of that car.

123
00:06:21,167 --> 00:06:22,250
Huh?

124
00:06:22,833 --> 00:06:23,958
Well...

125
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:25,417
Ugh.

126
00:06:59,417 --> 00:07:00,417
No, no.

127
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:03,667
Fuck. Fuck.

128
00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:05,042
No, no, no, no, no.

129
00:07:06,417 --> 00:07:07,334
Fuck.

130
00:07:07,417 --> 00:07:11,875
Goddamn. Shit. Fuck. Fuck.
Come on. Come on. Go, go, go!

131
00:07:13,042 --> 00:07:15,375
Okay. Okay.

132
00:07:17,542 --> 00:07:18,625
Uh-uh.

133
00:07:19,125 --> 00:07:20,958
Uh-uh. Fuck!

134
00:07:26,458 --> 00:07:27,458
Fuck!

135
00:07:30,917 --> 00:07:32,042
Sorry, Lisa.

136
00:07:35,917 --> 00:07:38,084
-Morning, Rick.
-Dale told me to shoot if you came in.

137
00:07:38,167 --> 00:07:40,625
-I might ask you to anyway...
-I have to be able to count on you.

138
00:07:40,708 --> 00:07:42,917
I know, I'm sorry. My
car shit the bed again.

139
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,042
Well, then you should consider
purchasing a car that you can count on.

140
00:07:46,125 --> 00:07:52,542
And if that car is unreliable, may
I suggest, once again, a bus pass.

141
00:07:52,625 --> 00:07:54,084
You're absolutely right, Dale.

142
00:07:54,167 --> 00:07:56,542
Sure, Dale's the uncool
guy with the bus pass.

143
00:07:56,625 --> 00:07:58,459
-But, uh, you wanna know what is cool?
-Mmm.

144
00:07:58,542 --> 00:08:02,167
Low carbon emissions. Yeah,
no monthly insurance payments.

145
00:08:02,250 --> 00:08:03,500
Getting to work on time.

146
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:07,167
Uh, excuse me. What is
the ETA on that filter?

147
00:08:08,333 --> 00:08:10,167
I think your fish is sick, Dale.

148
00:08:10,667 --> 00:08:11,834
Next.

149
00:08:11,917 --> 00:08:14,000
But you reversed
the fee last time.

150
00:08:14,083 --> 00:08:16,959
Yeah. Yeah, we did. We offered
you that one-time reversal.

151
00:08:17,042 --> 00:08:21,167
-Do you understand what a fixed budget is?
-I do. I'm on one.

152
00:08:22,333 --> 00:08:24,167
Hands up, motherfuckers.

153
00:08:24,250 --> 00:08:26,209
Everybody, on the
ground. Phones out, now!

154
00:08:26,292 --> 00:08:28,584
Hands up! Back that ass up!

155
00:08:28,667 --> 00:08:31,750
-Phones out!
-You! Gimme your phone! Gimme your phone!

156
00:08:31,833 --> 00:08:33,042
Open it!

157
00:08:33,125 --> 00:08:34,750
-Okay, okay, okay, okay.
-Now!

158
00:08:35,917 --> 00:08:37,167
Open it!

159
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:38,333
Get over here now!

160
00:08:39,125 --> 00:08:40,458
Get your ass down.

161
00:08:41,042 --> 00:08:42,500
-On the ground.
-Ah, not you.

162
00:08:42,583 --> 00:08:45,584
-Get up. Open the drawer.
-On the floor.

163
00:08:45,667 --> 00:08:47,208
Get your ass on the ground.

164
00:08:47,958 --> 00:08:49,667
Uh-uh. Stay down!

165
00:08:51,458 --> 00:08:53,583
Hey! Get your ass down!

166
00:08:54,833 --> 00:08:57,334
-Let's go. Nice and easy.
-Okay. Okay.

167
00:08:57,417 --> 00:08:59,959
-You idiot! Pick it up!
-I'm sorry.

168
00:09:00,042 --> 00:09:03,708
Get it all in there. I'm not
fucking with you! Pick it up!

169
00:09:04,917 --> 00:09:08,334
Motherfucker!

170
00:09:08,417 --> 00:09:11,000
-Goddamn it! Look what you did.
-That was not supposed to happen!

171
00:09:11,083 --> 00:09:13,084
-You did that shit on purpose!
-Oh, God.

172
00:09:13,167 --> 00:09:15,292
-Look at my face! Dumb bitch!
-I swear! It must've been broken!

173
00:09:15,375 --> 00:09:17,084
Look what you did to me!
Look what you did to my face!

174
00:09:17,167 --> 00:09:19,834
You're fucking lying
to me, you bitch.

175
00:09:19,917 --> 00:09:21,584
-Goddamn it!
-That's not supposed to happen.

176
00:09:21,667 --> 00:09:24,292
Look what you did! You
did this shit on purpose!

177
00:09:31,708 --> 00:09:33,417
No fractures, no concussion.

178
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:34,959
Everyone okay at the bank?

179
00:09:35,042 --> 00:09:39,500
Far as I know. Security guard broke
an orbital bone, but, otherwise...

180
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:41,875
Oh, and they got
caught. The robbers.

181
00:09:41,958 --> 00:09:45,000
Yeah, I figured. They made, like, five
mistakes before they even hit the drawers.

182
00:09:45,083 --> 00:09:47,250
Sounds like your bank
must get robbed a lot

183
00:09:47,333 --> 00:09:49,250
for you to be so
educated on the subject.

184
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:52,375
Employee training
simulations and all that.

185
00:09:54,125 --> 00:09:56,292
Okay. Couple more tests
before we can think about

186
00:09:56,375 --> 00:09:58,855
throwing you back out on the
street, considering the pregnancy.

187
00:10:02,458 --> 00:10:04,250
"The pregnancy"?
What pregnancy?

188
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:07,625
Your pregnancy.

189
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:12,084
We run blood work in the case where you
might be pregnant, among other things,

190
00:10:12,167 --> 00:10:15,834
and, yeah, you're pregnant.

191
00:10:20,167 --> 00:10:21,125
So, you lied to me.

192
00:10:21,208 --> 00:10:25,167
Hey, man. I just got pistol-whipped
and found out I'm pregnant.

193
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:26,625
Give me a break.

194
00:10:26,708 --> 00:10:28,625
Three and a half
months, though? Really?

195
00:10:28,708 --> 00:10:31,709
I have a history of skipping periods,
I've been stressed like crazy lately.

196
00:10:31,792 --> 00:10:33,084
-I don't...
-You see that stuff on TV

197
00:10:33,167 --> 00:10:35,459
about those obese people that have
no idea that they're pregnant?

198
00:10:35,542 --> 00:10:37,000
So, yeah, that does happen.

199
00:10:37,583 --> 00:10:40,084
Look, it's gonna be all right.
There's worse shit than this.

200
00:10:40,167 --> 00:10:41,250
Should I tell him?

201
00:10:42,667 --> 00:10:43,667
John?

202
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:45,875
-Yeah, well...
-Whoa, are you kidding me with this shit?

203
00:10:45,958 --> 00:10:47,500
No, but, like, why
would you even say that?

204
00:10:47,583 --> 00:10:49,084
Well, if it was reversed...

205
00:10:49,167 --> 00:10:52,167
If it was reversed, you would have to
go save that baby from that motherfucker

206
00:10:52,250 --> 00:10:54,542
'cause he's a goddamn
garbage fire. And a criminal.

207
00:10:54,625 --> 00:10:56,167
I was no sweetheart
either, Baby.

208
00:10:56,250 --> 00:10:57,917
-You were a kid, Edie.
-Yeah, so was he.

209
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,000
And a lot of things we did,
they were my choices too.

210
00:11:01,083 --> 00:11:04,042
After getting dumped into one
shitty foster home after another,

211
00:11:04,125 --> 00:11:05,292
with one shitty
dad after another,

212
00:11:05,375 --> 00:11:06,459
-he was the only one...
-Whoa, whoa.

213
00:11:06,542 --> 00:11:09,834
Those pieces of shit don't excuse
the shit that John put you through.

214
00:11:09,917 --> 00:11:11,625
You don't know the
things that I did.

215
00:11:11,708 --> 00:11:12,917
And I don't need to.

216
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:17,084
I know who you are now. And what the fuck
we been doing for the last year, huh?

217
00:11:17,167 --> 00:11:18,750
Like, busting our ass, for what?

218
00:11:18,833 --> 00:11:20,542
I don't know.

219
00:11:24,458 --> 00:11:28,292
Whatever you decide to do with this
baby, you got folks that got your back.

220
00:11:28,875 --> 00:11:32,000
We will figure it out
without that motherfucker.

221
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:33,667
We can raise funds or something.

222
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:35,959
Yeah, maybe we could
GoFundMe my abortion.

223
00:11:36,042 --> 00:11:38,625
Hell yeah. Put that shit
on Facebook. What you mean?

224
00:11:38,708 --> 00:11:40,959
-I know my aunties, they'll hook you up.
-Baby Girl.

225
00:11:41,042 --> 00:11:43,292
What, Teenie-weenie-peenie?
The fuck you want?

226
00:11:43,375 --> 00:11:45,709
I don't wanna get you fired.

227
00:11:45,792 --> 00:11:47,375
Oh, I ain't never
getting fired.

228
00:11:47,458 --> 00:11:49,542
Yeah, he sent me a dick
pic on accident once.

229
00:11:49,625 --> 00:11:52,000
He knows I'll send that shit to corporate
if he ever tries to fuck with me,

230
00:11:52,083 --> 00:11:53,792
so, I'm good.

231
00:11:53,875 --> 00:11:55,000
Oh, you coming by later?

232
00:11:55,083 --> 00:12:00,709
Ugh, I have my fucking test tomorrow.
I just wanna get it over with.

233
00:12:00,792 --> 00:12:03,417
Okay. But do not call
that motherfucker.

234
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:04,917
-I won't.
-Baby Girl?

235
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,250
I'm coming.

236
00:12:06,333 --> 00:12:07,542
-Bye, boo.
-Bye.

237
00:12:07,625 --> 00:12:10,833
What? Damn. I'm here. Okay.

238
00:12:52,625 --> 00:12:54,042
Shit.

239
00:13:42,333 --> 00:13:43,333
John?

240
00:13:56,375 --> 00:13:57,375
John?

241
00:14:16,167 --> 00:14:18,792
-Where is Leo, John? Where is he?
-Come on, John.

242
00:14:18,875 --> 00:14:22,000
-I told you. I don't know where he is.
-I'm getting bored, John.

243
00:14:22,083 --> 00:14:24,292
If I get any more bored, I'm
gonna break your fucking head.

244
00:14:24,375 --> 00:14:27,000
-You know what I'm talking about.
-Ow!

245
00:14:27,083 --> 00:14:30,163
-I told you I don't know where he is!
-Punch him right in the face.

246
00:14:33,125 --> 00:14:35,333
Fuck that little piece of shit!

247
00:14:39,167 --> 00:14:40,167
Fuck!

248
00:14:53,708 --> 00:14:56,459
Aw, geez.

249
00:14:56,542 --> 00:14:59,167
Look at your face. Fuck.

250
00:14:59,250 --> 00:15:01,000
Tell us what you
did with Leo, John.

251
00:15:01,083 --> 00:15:04,292
Yeah, we don't wanna kill you
today. It's my son's birthday.

252
00:15:04,375 --> 00:15:05,709
Hey!

253
00:15:07,167 --> 00:15:08,875
John, the fuck are you doing?

254
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Come on! Fuck!

255
00:15:17,833 --> 00:15:18,875
What the fuck did you do?

256
00:15:22,667 --> 00:15:23,667
Tell me what you did!

257
00:15:28,792 --> 00:15:31,750
-Yo! This way! This way! This way!
-Damn it!

258
00:15:31,833 --> 00:15:33,542
White trash, you
still owe me 20.

259
00:15:33,625 --> 00:15:34,875
I'll pay you back!

260
00:15:36,917 --> 00:15:38,292
Tell me what you did!

261
00:15:42,792 --> 00:15:44,500
Fuck. John. Where are you going?

262
00:15:44,583 --> 00:15:45,792
Ow.

263
00:15:46,375 --> 00:15:48,167
It was already open.

264
00:15:50,083 --> 00:15:51,667
John, whose place is this?

265
00:15:52,917 --> 00:15:54,958
John, whose place is this? John!

266
00:15:56,542 --> 00:15:58,750
-Sweetie's.
-Who the fuck is Sweetie?

267
00:15:58,833 --> 00:16:00,750
-John! John!
-These work.

268
00:16:00,833 --> 00:16:02,625
John, who the fuck
is after us? John.

269
00:16:04,167 --> 00:16:05,500
Shit! Jesus!

270
00:16:05,583 --> 00:16:06,833
Who the fuck are you?

271
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:09,667
We're friends of Sweetie. Sweetie
said I could borrow his gun.

272
00:16:09,750 --> 00:16:12,334
-And Sweetie said...
-Oh, you talking about this gun?

273
00:16:12,417 --> 00:16:15,125
This my gun now. And Sweetie
ain't around here no more.

274
00:16:15,208 --> 00:16:16,334
But this is all Sweetie's stuff.

275
00:16:16,417 --> 00:16:20,792
No. This Byron's stuff.
Byron's gun, Byron's apartment.

276
00:16:20,875 --> 00:16:23,709
And why do you
have on my shorts?

277
00:16:23,792 --> 00:16:25,459
That's my after-shower
shit, man.

278
00:16:25,542 --> 00:16:28,625
Byron, just call Sweetie.
He'll tell you he knows me.

279
00:16:28,708 --> 00:16:30,250
-Pretty sure Sweetie's dead, John.
-What?

280
00:16:30,333 --> 00:16:33,375
-Who the fuck are they?
-These Sweetie's friends.

281
00:16:33,458 --> 00:16:35,209
Sweetie ain't here no mores.

282
00:16:36,375 --> 00:16:37,625
Now, who the fuck is that?

283
00:16:37,708 --> 00:16:39,959
Hey, Byron, Byron. Look at me.

284
00:16:40,042 --> 00:16:42,959
They're after us, they have
guns, they're very dangerous.

285
00:16:43,042 --> 00:16:44,042
Hey! They in here!

286
00:16:44,125 --> 00:16:46,084
-Shit. Shit!
-Byron, we can work this out.

287
00:16:46,167 --> 00:16:49,875
-You got money?
-Uh, we do. We can get it after.

288
00:16:49,958 --> 00:16:51,417
Nah, man. Fuck your "after."

289
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:53,792
-Sh... Hold this, baby.
-No, hey... Byron, don't do...

290
00:16:54,333 --> 00:16:56,500
These motherfuckers got money?

291
00:16:56,583 --> 00:16:58,250
They want...

292
00:16:58,333 --> 00:16:59,709
Hey, hold the fuck up.

293
00:16:59,792 --> 00:17:03,042
I know you motherfuckers ain't
knockin' on my goddamn door like that.

294
00:17:03,667 --> 00:17:04,708
What the f...

295
00:17:07,333 --> 00:17:10,459
Oh, fuck. What the shit?

296
00:17:10,542 --> 00:17:11,542
John! John!

297
00:17:11,625 --> 00:17:13,584
John! Listen to me. Bust
ass to the back bedroom now.

298
00:17:13,667 --> 00:17:15,627
-No, no, no, no.
-Go, go, go, go. What the fuck?

299
00:17:16,542 --> 00:17:17,542
Go, go, go.

300
00:17:17,625 --> 00:17:19,708
Fuck it.

301
00:17:23,625 --> 00:17:26,584
What the fuck did
you do? Who's Leo?

302
00:17:26,667 --> 00:17:29,375
Let's fucking go!

303
00:17:29,458 --> 00:17:30,542
Go, go, go, go!

304
00:17:35,333 --> 00:17:36,334
Where's your car?

305
00:17:36,417 --> 00:17:37,917
I don't have my
car. I took the bus.

306
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,167
-Shit.
-Yeah.

307
00:17:44,208 --> 00:17:45,583
Hold up.

308
00:17:51,542 --> 00:17:52,584
Throw me the keys.

309
00:17:56,083 --> 00:17:57,083
Get in.

310
00:18:10,208 --> 00:18:12,250
Oh, shit!

311
00:18:21,667 --> 00:18:22,750
What the...

312
00:18:22,833 --> 00:18:24,500
Yeah, baby! Yeah!

313
00:18:27,167 --> 00:18:28,458
Whoo!

314
00:18:31,042 --> 00:18:33,292
Edie! No, no, no, no, no, no.

315
00:18:38,125 --> 00:18:39,125
Shit.

316
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:41,000
No way out. No way out.

317
00:18:41,083 --> 00:18:42,458
I got it. I got it.

318
00:18:57,750 --> 00:18:58,833
Go, go, go, go!

319
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,625
Edie. Edie! Car, car, car!

320
00:19:09,167 --> 00:19:12,833
Oh, shit!

321
00:19:13,958 --> 00:19:15,792
Shut the fuck up!

322
00:19:20,583 --> 00:19:21,583
Go!

323
00:19:22,708 --> 00:19:23,792
Wait, no. On your left.

324
00:19:23,875 --> 00:19:25,625
-What are they doing?
-Go.

325
00:19:27,583 --> 00:19:28,583
Shit.

326
00:19:46,417 --> 00:19:48,333
He's coming up this
road. Go, go, go, go, go.

327
00:19:50,458 --> 00:19:52,792
-What crazy shit are you about to do?
-This crazy shit.

328
00:20:13,958 --> 00:20:15,917
Bitch, I'm from Cleveland!

329
00:20:32,750 --> 00:20:34,208
Tell me you don't miss that.

330
00:20:35,458 --> 00:20:36,500
What did you do?

331
00:20:36,583 --> 00:20:38,667
Huh? Oh. Okay. Hey.

332
00:20:40,042 --> 00:20:42,000
Slow down. It's just
a misunderstanding.

333
00:20:42,083 --> 00:20:43,167
What was I thinking
coming to see you?

334
00:20:43,250 --> 00:20:46,084
I step back into your life for
five seconds. Five seconds.

335
00:20:46,167 --> 00:20:47,167
-You know what?
-What?

336
00:20:47,250 --> 00:20:48,500
-This is not my problem.
-What do you mean?

337
00:20:48,583 --> 00:20:50,000
-What are you talking about?
-It's not my problem.

338
00:20:50,083 --> 00:20:51,334
-Come on. What are you...
-Bye.

339
00:20:51,417 --> 00:20:52,792
Edie, hold on. Can we just...

340
00:20:52,875 --> 00:20:54,667
Can we just talk about
this for a second?

341
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:57,500
Edie. Edie.

342
00:20:59,167 --> 00:21:00,709
Hey! Come on, Edie.

343
00:21:00,792 --> 00:21:02,292
You can't leave me here.
I ain't got no clothes.

344
00:21:02,375 --> 00:21:03,459
Tell me what you did!

345
00:21:03,542 --> 00:21:05,375
Hold on.

346
00:21:05,458 --> 00:21:08,375
-Tell me what you did!
-Don't. Come on, don't be crazy.

347
00:21:12,292 --> 00:21:15,250
Okay! I'll show you,
okay? I'll show you.

348
00:21:21,083 --> 00:21:22,834
-Jesus Christ.
-Just stop already.

349
00:21:22,917 --> 00:21:25,000
You're making judgments
and you don't know nothing.

350
00:21:25,083 --> 00:21:28,083
We're at a rat-fucked warehouse
in the middle of fuck-nowhere.

351
00:21:30,875 --> 00:21:33,084
What, I'm supposed to expect
there's Christmas presents in there?

352
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:36,125
Baskets full of puppies?

353
00:21:38,542 --> 00:21:40,875
Oh, fuck yeah, Sweetie.

354
00:21:46,750 --> 00:21:48,209
That's a person-sized box.

355
00:21:48,292 --> 00:21:52,375
Please tell me there is not a person
in that goddamn person-sized box.

356
00:21:52,458 --> 00:21:54,250
-Leo.
-Yeah, it's a fucking person. Fuck!

357
00:21:54,333 --> 00:21:55,750
-Leo.
-He's dead, isn't he?

358
00:21:55,833 --> 00:21:57,584
He's not... Oh,
shit. You know what?

359
00:21:57,667 --> 00:21:58,959
-Jesus Christ!
-Uh,

360
00:21:59,042 --> 00:22:00,584
I think he might've
rolled over in the night.

361
00:22:00,667 --> 00:22:02,959
-No, it's fine.
-He can't breathe in there!

362
00:22:03,042 --> 00:22:04,167
No, I poked holes.

363
00:22:04,250 --> 00:22:06,792
I just think he might've covered
'em up when he rolled over.

364
00:22:06,875 --> 00:22:08,208
For fuck's sake.

365
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,667
Leo. Leo, wake up.

366
00:22:10,750 --> 00:22:13,250
No, that's it. Good luck with your
dead body, you fucking dingdong.

367
00:22:13,333 --> 00:22:16,292
Jesus Christ. He puts holes in the
box like he's a goddamn turtle.

368
00:22:16,875 --> 00:22:19,667
Don't do this to me right now, you piece
of shit. Wake up. Don't do this. Leo!

369
00:22:19,750 --> 00:22:23,334
He's alive! Edie, he's alive!

370
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:27,833
-What the fuck?
-Fuck you. Fuck you, John.

371
00:22:33,708 --> 00:22:34,792
He's alive.

372
00:22:37,458 --> 00:22:39,333
We're good.

373
00:22:41,792 --> 00:22:43,209
He's a card counter.

374
00:22:43,292 --> 00:22:44,709
Player. Card player.

375
00:22:44,792 --> 00:22:47,167
-Nico calls you "card counter," so...
-Wait, this is Nico's guy?

376
00:22:47,250 --> 00:22:49,709
What the fuck, John?
Are you serious?

377
00:22:49,792 --> 00:22:52,250
I told him. I told him I
can't play for anybody else.

378
00:22:52,333 --> 00:22:55,875
It was one game on an Indian
reservation. No one was even gonna know.

379
00:22:55,958 --> 00:22:57,542
What are you not
getting about this?

380
00:22:57,625 --> 00:23:00,125
-All you had to do was play one game.
-Nico would fucking kill me!

381
00:23:00,208 --> 00:23:01,750
Shut the fuck up!

382
00:23:03,333 --> 00:23:05,750
Just tell me exactly
what happened.

383
00:23:05,833 --> 00:23:08,167
Uh, fine. Okay.

384
00:23:08,250 --> 00:23:11,709
So, uh, we hooked up for drinks.

385
00:23:11,792 --> 00:23:14,625
Right? He has a
few. I have a few.

386
00:23:14,708 --> 00:23:17,209
And then I proposed a thing
about a game I had heard about.

387
00:23:17,292 --> 00:23:20,292
And I told you, "I can't
because I work for Nico."

388
00:23:20,375 --> 00:23:22,375
He made me do cocaine.

389
00:23:22,458 --> 00:23:26,084
My wife would kill me if she knew
I did cocaine. She'd divorce me.

390
00:23:26,167 --> 00:23:27,375
Oh, please. I didn't
hear you argue.

391
00:23:27,458 --> 00:23:30,000
Why would I argue? Who
doesn't love cocaine?

392
00:23:30,083 --> 00:23:32,375
And then he hit me because
I wouldn't take the job.

393
00:23:32,458 --> 00:23:34,792
I apologized, and then I
offered you a ride home.

394
00:23:34,875 --> 00:23:37,042
But you didn't. You put
me in this fucking box.

395
00:23:37,125 --> 00:23:38,125
I almost died.

396
00:23:38,208 --> 00:23:39,459
He was gonna call Nico, Eds.

397
00:23:39,542 --> 00:23:41,084
And I poked holes in
the box, by the way.

398
00:23:41,167 --> 00:23:42,625
Oh, like a fucking hamster?

399
00:23:42,708 --> 00:23:43,875
Maybe you are a fucking hamster.

400
00:23:43,958 --> 00:23:45,709
What does that even mean?

401
00:23:45,792 --> 00:23:49,792
Eds, wait. Hold on. Wait, E-Edie, come
on. Would you just wait up for a second?

402
00:23:49,875 --> 00:23:50,959
Take him back to Nico.

403
00:23:51,042 --> 00:23:52,750
Edie, come on. You
know we can't do that.

404
00:23:52,833 --> 00:23:54,125
What "we"? I ain't doin' shit.

405
00:23:54,208 --> 00:23:55,209
Oh, God.

406
00:23:55,292 --> 00:23:57,042
You guys are gonna talk
about fucking killing me,

407
00:23:57,125 --> 00:23:59,125
and then you're gonna kill
me. Jesus, Mary and Joseph.

408
00:23:59,208 --> 00:24:00,625
-Shut up!
-Shut up!

409
00:24:02,333 --> 00:24:05,084
Can we just, like, think
this through for a second?

410
00:24:05,167 --> 00:24:07,375
Yeah, 'cause that's your strong
suit, "thinking things through."

411
00:24:07,458 --> 00:24:11,542
Bring him back alive.
Apologize to that jagoff.

412
00:24:11,625 --> 00:24:15,000
Apologize to Nico.
That is your only shot.

413
00:24:16,292 --> 00:24:19,208
You don't have to
do this, you know?

414
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:22,459
Where are you taking me?

415
00:24:22,542 --> 00:24:23,792
Back to Nico.

416
00:24:23,875 --> 00:24:26,750
And why would I believe that
after he put me in a fucking box?

417
00:24:26,833 --> 00:24:28,167
I apologized for that.

418
00:24:28,250 --> 00:24:30,709
John, Leo, you're both gonna
tell Nico it was a mistake.

419
00:24:30,792 --> 00:24:32,792
You got fucked up and
did some stupid shit.

420
00:24:32,875 --> 00:24:34,334
You know, boys being
boys or whatever.

421
00:24:34,417 --> 00:24:36,084
And tell me, why
would I do that?

422
00:24:36,167 --> 00:24:37,807
Your wife won't find
out you did cocaine.

423
00:24:38,792 --> 00:24:39,833
'Kay?

424
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:45,980
Do you have any more
of that cocaine?

425
00:24:47,458 --> 00:24:48,625
No.

426
00:24:52,667 --> 00:24:53,584
I need something to eat.

427
00:24:53,667 --> 00:24:56,209
Totally acceptable.
We're happy to stop.

428
00:24:56,292 --> 00:24:58,292
I think there's a burger
joint right up the street.

429
00:24:58,375 --> 00:24:59,500
I'm a vegetarian.

430
00:24:59,583 --> 00:25:03,208
-Jesus. Figures.
-John. John, I swear to God.

431
00:25:04,042 --> 00:25:05,542
Whatever you want,
Leo. Our treat.

432
00:25:06,375 --> 00:25:07,417
I'd like a falafel.

433
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:09,250
Fucking falafel.

434
00:25:09,750 --> 00:25:11,750
There's a place I
like on Court Street.

435
00:25:11,833 --> 00:25:13,750
-It's just up a few blocks.
-Okay, fuck that.

436
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,459
We're going to the burger place.

437
00:25:19,542 --> 00:25:22,542
You could get fries, or whatever
isn't fucking cow or pig or whatever.

438
00:25:22,625 --> 00:25:23,625
Okay, Gandhi?

439
00:25:23,708 --> 00:25:24,917
I got money. I got it.

440
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,417
Hey, hey!

441
00:25:34,167 --> 00:25:35,167
Just go.

442
00:25:51,875 --> 00:25:52,875
What up, gangster?

443
00:25:57,750 --> 00:25:58,917
Hey.

444
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,375
What are you doing?

445
00:26:02,625 --> 00:26:05,000
You can't put what that vegan
piece of shit did on me.

446
00:26:06,542 --> 00:26:08,292
Would you just stop?
We can figure this out.

447
00:26:08,375 --> 00:26:10,667
I ain't figurin' shit.

448
00:26:10,750 --> 00:26:13,959
I am done cleaning up your messes.
You're a living shit show, John.

449
00:26:14,042 --> 00:26:17,292
You're the fucking Hiroshima and
the 9/11 of fucking human beings.

450
00:26:17,375 --> 00:26:19,209
Hey, don't say
stuff you'll regret.

451
00:26:19,292 --> 00:26:20,417
Regret is all I have.

452
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:24,125
I regret every second of every
minute I walked back into your life.

453
00:26:24,833 --> 00:26:26,709
Take it back. You don't mean it.

454
00:26:26,792 --> 00:26:27,959
Oh, yes, I do mean it!

455
00:26:28,042 --> 00:26:30,709
And if I had a time machine,
I'd hit the button that said,

456
00:26:30,792 --> 00:26:34,584
"The day before you met
John's stupid fucking ass!"

457
00:26:34,667 --> 00:26:36,334
That would not be a button.

458
00:26:38,917 --> 00:26:39,917
What?

459
00:26:45,333 --> 00:26:46,500
<i>Eenie Meanie.</i>

460
00:26:48,208 --> 00:26:50,292
You remember who came up
with that name for you?

461
00:26:53,417 --> 00:26:54,458
<i>You still there?</i>

462
00:26:56,083 --> 00:26:57,334
Who is it?

463
00:26:57,417 --> 00:26:58,792
You, Nico. It was you.

464
00:27:01,083 --> 00:27:02,750
<i>I was always
proud of that one.</i>

465
00:27:03,250 --> 00:27:07,042
Not that it wasn't right there.
"Edith Meaney." "Eenie Meanie."

466
00:27:07,917 --> 00:27:13,208
So small behind the wheel of a
car, but you were always so...

467
00:27:14,542 --> 00:27:15,542
Mean.

468
00:27:16,083 --> 00:27:17,833
Like a dog with his balls cut.

469
00:27:20,333 --> 00:27:22,000
Dogs are meaner
with their balls.

470
00:27:24,167 --> 00:27:26,583
Always the smartest one
in the room, weren't you?

471
00:27:28,083 --> 00:27:30,667
Unfortunately, you weren't smart
enough to stay away from John.

472
00:27:32,208 --> 00:27:34,417
And let's not pretend
he's not there with you.

473
00:27:39,958 --> 00:27:41,292
The store in an hour.

474
00:28:07,625 --> 00:28:08,625
What'd he say?

475
00:28:12,042 --> 00:28:14,000
Hey. Ow! Hey. What the fuck?

476
00:28:14,083 --> 00:28:16,792
Ow! St... Cut it
out! What the fuck?

477
00:28:24,458 --> 00:28:25,583
What?

478
00:28:26,083 --> 00:28:29,667
John. You're gonna keep your
mouth shut in there, all right?

479
00:28:29,750 --> 00:28:32,208
You're gonna let me do the
talking. Do you hear me?

480
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:35,500
-Do you?
-Yeah, I got it.

481
00:28:35,583 --> 00:28:36,834
I'ma grab a snack.

482
00:28:36,917 --> 00:28:38,542
No you're not. Hey.

483
00:28:38,625 --> 00:28:42,500
Put that down, or I'm gonna jump behind
that register and grab the shotgun.

484
00:28:43,750 --> 00:28:44,750
I already opened it.

485
00:28:47,375 --> 00:28:48,375
Do you have any money?

486
00:28:50,958 --> 00:28:53,750
I know, but if the doctor calls, it's
good or bad news, I could just...

487
00:28:53,833 --> 00:28:56,709
What do you mean good or bad...
You think it's gonna be bad news?

488
00:28:56,792 --> 00:28:59,625
Well, I... I worded it wrong. Look,
you're gonna make yourself sick, okay?

489
00:28:59,708 --> 00:29:01,250
Hey. Sit down.

490
00:29:01,833 --> 00:29:03,375
-Nic, you work too much...
-What?

491
00:29:03,458 --> 00:29:05,500
...and you make yourself sick,
where's that gonna leave me?

492
00:29:05,583 --> 00:29:06,709
Less fortunate.

493
00:29:06,792 --> 00:29:07,834
-That's not...
-What?

494
00:29:07,917 --> 00:29:09,250
That's not what I'm
saying here. I'm trying...

495
00:29:09,333 --> 00:29:11,167
If the doctor calls, I'm
gonna take the call myself.

496
00:29:11,250 --> 00:29:12,584
-All right.
-Is it off silent?

497
00:29:12,667 --> 00:29:14,667
The kid out front, he
set it to ring and buzz.

498
00:29:14,750 --> 00:29:18,208
The kid outs... Why can't you s...
Forget about it. Forget I asked.

499
00:29:18,750 --> 00:29:20,875
-Hey. My girl.
-Nico.

500
00:29:20,958 --> 00:29:21,959
Long time.

501
00:29:22,042 --> 00:29:23,917
No offense, but I was
hoping for longer.

502
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
Well, how long has it been?

503
00:29:26,083 --> 00:29:27,584
Oh, it's that
museum thing, right?

504
00:29:27,667 --> 00:29:29,334
-Five, six years?
-Seven.

505
00:29:29,417 --> 00:29:30,584
That one went south, didn't it?

506
00:29:30,667 --> 00:29:32,959
I put that scrub on the
job. What was his name?

507
00:29:33,042 --> 00:29:34,292
-Mitts.
-Yeah, Mitts.

508
00:29:34,375 --> 00:29:35,792
Big hands, right?
Basketball player.

509
00:29:35,875 --> 00:29:37,417
-Catcher. Baseball.
-Cat... Catcher.

510
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:39,180
People thought he had
a shot at going pro.

511
00:29:39,708 --> 00:29:43,042
Oh. I guess he never got a shot
at going pro, did he, Edith?

512
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,125
Eenie Meanie.

513
00:29:47,042 --> 00:29:49,458
Always cleaning up
everybody's messes.

514
00:29:51,125 --> 00:29:52,042
Are those for everybody?

515
00:29:52,125 --> 00:29:53,708
Hey! The fuck you doing?

516
00:29:54,333 --> 00:29:56,500
Did I offer you a
fucking piece of candy?

517
00:29:56,583 --> 00:29:58,417
-You gotta be careful, Nic.
-Tell me about it.

518
00:29:58,500 --> 00:30:00,334
You're gonna have a stroke,
where does that leave me?

519
00:30:00,417 --> 00:30:02,459
-Like I said, less fortunate.
-That's not fair.

520
00:30:02,542 --> 00:30:05,250
Georgie worries about
me. Wants me to exercise.

521
00:30:05,333 --> 00:30:07,625
He wants me to take care
of that thing. What is it?

522
00:30:07,708 --> 00:30:09,959
Gut health. Probiotics.

523
00:30:10,042 --> 00:30:11,584
Probiotics.

524
00:30:11,667 --> 00:30:13,167
I think I read
something about that.

525
00:30:13,250 --> 00:30:17,250
Oh. We got a reader over
here. Bobby Book Club.

526
00:30:17,333 --> 00:30:19,209
The only thing you've ever
read in your miserable life

527
00:30:19,292 --> 00:30:22,584
is a prescription on the side of a bottle
that you stole out of some guy's car,

528
00:30:22,667 --> 00:30:25,084
you miserable junkie bum fuck.

529
00:30:25,167 --> 00:30:26,792
Could you get to the
fucking point here, please?

530
00:30:26,875 --> 00:30:27,958
Oh, excuse me.

531
00:30:30,333 --> 00:30:33,292
Did this, uh, unemployable
dick nugget...

532
00:30:33,375 --> 00:30:35,667
<i>Did he tell you about his
last masterpiece he painted?</i>

533
00:30:35,750 --> 00:30:37,917
-It wasn't my fault.
-Hey, what the fuck are you saying to me?

534
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,084
-It wasn't your fault.
-Nothing. S-Sorry.

535
00:30:40,167 --> 00:30:42,459
<i>I gave you one simple
direction. What was it?</i>

536
00:30:42,542 --> 00:30:44,417
Not a fucking sound.

537
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:46,042
-But it wasn't my fault.
-It wasn't your fucking fault?

538
00:30:46,125 --> 00:30:47,667
You went up there,
the house was dark.

539
00:30:48,167 --> 00:30:50,167
-Open the door. Do it quick.
-All right. Okay.

540
00:30:50,250 --> 00:30:51,958
Don't fuck with us, honky.

541
00:30:52,458 --> 00:30:54,417
Honky? You're white too.

542
00:30:54,917 --> 00:30:57,000
Don't tell him that. I'm trying
to throw him off the scent.

543
00:30:57,083 --> 00:30:58,084
He can see your hands.

544
00:30:58,167 --> 00:31:00,334
-What did I tell you?
-Case the house first.

545
00:31:00,417 --> 00:31:02,042
Case the fucking house first!

546
00:31:02,958 --> 00:31:04,209
Surprise!

547
00:31:06,667 --> 00:31:07,667
Oh, shit.

548
00:31:13,042 --> 00:31:15,417
You fucking ass...
You motherfucker!

549
00:31:18,583 --> 00:31:20,209
How much money did Leo
make for us last year?

550
00:31:20,292 --> 00:31:23,125
-6, 7 hundred thousand, give or take.
-6, 7 hundred thousand.

551
00:31:23,208 --> 00:31:25,500
You know why I like that
money? Because it had no risk.

552
00:31:25,583 --> 00:31:27,959
Prostitution, drugs? High risk.

553
00:31:28,042 --> 00:31:31,167
But a guy who counts cards and
wins a little bit like Leo?

554
00:31:31,250 --> 00:31:32,334
What's the worst
that can happen?

555
00:31:32,417 --> 00:31:35,500
Eh, someone gets the unfortunate job
of scraping his brains off the street.

556
00:31:35,583 --> 00:31:37,334
That's the worst.
But here's the thing.

557
00:31:37,417 --> 00:31:40,750
A guy like Leo, a counter, they
do tend to burn out, right?

558
00:31:40,833 --> 00:31:42,292
-Right.
-So?

559
00:31:42,375 --> 00:31:44,917
Leo had, what, three or
four years left with us?

560
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,000
Give or take.

561
00:31:46,083 --> 00:31:49,459
What kinda projected earnings
lost in that period of time

562
00:31:49,542 --> 00:31:51,334
because of this
unemployable motherfucker?

563
00:31:51,417 --> 00:31:54,125
I like to round
up, so, $3 million.

564
00:31:54,208 --> 00:31:55,792
-Give or take.
-Give or take.

565
00:31:55,875 --> 00:31:57,333
$3 million.

566
00:31:58,250 --> 00:32:00,542
But I got some good news
for you, Johnny boy.

567
00:32:00,625 --> 00:32:03,875
It just so happens there's gonna
be a casino poker tournament

568
00:32:03,958 --> 00:32:06,209
in just a few days in Toledo.

569
00:32:06,292 --> 00:32:08,334
And you know what the
prize money is for...

570
00:32:08,417 --> 00:32:10,292
for the winner of that
particular tournament?

571
00:32:10,375 --> 00:32:12,709
Three million dollars.

572
00:32:12,792 --> 00:32:14,542
Neither of us are
card players, Nico.

573
00:32:14,625 --> 00:32:16,042
I'm a card player.

574
00:32:16,125 --> 00:32:17,334
No, you're fucking not.

575
00:32:17,417 --> 00:32:18,792
I don't need a card player.

576
00:32:20,667 --> 00:32:21,833
I need a driver.

577
00:32:24,792 --> 00:32:25,875
You wanna steal it?

578
00:32:25,958 --> 00:32:27,167
It's more fun than that.

579
00:32:27,250 --> 00:32:30,875
The three million dollars is given to
the winner of that particular tournament,

580
00:32:30,958 --> 00:32:33,708
and it's gonna be put into
the trunk of a brand-new...

581
00:32:34,208 --> 00:32:35,833
Uh, the car is still TBD.

582
00:32:36,750 --> 00:32:37,709
What's a TBD?

583
00:32:37,792 --> 00:32:39,334
Uh, to-to be determined.

584
00:32:39,417 --> 00:32:42,208
Oh. A brand-new
to-be-determined car.

585
00:32:42,792 --> 00:32:48,458
You're our getaway driver. All you gotta
do is get in the car... and get away.

586
00:32:49,208 --> 00:32:51,125
Get Perm Walters to do it.
He's your guy now, right?

587
00:32:51,208 --> 00:32:53,875
Perm Walters does not owe
me three million dollars.

588
00:33:01,583 --> 00:33:03,584
Since I mostly worked for
you all those years ago,

589
00:33:03,667 --> 00:33:06,292
you know better than anyone
that I don't do that anymore.

590
00:33:06,375 --> 00:33:08,875
So unfortunately, I'm
gonna have to decline.

591
00:33:18,167 --> 00:33:21,334
She's declining.
Perfectly acceptable.

592
00:33:21,417 --> 00:33:22,459
-Eh.
-Yeah.

593
00:33:22,542 --> 00:33:24,209
I mean, she did a lot
of good work for us

594
00:33:24,292 --> 00:33:25,417
-in the past.
-She did.

595
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:27,042
-Never failed us.
-Never did.

596
00:33:27,125 --> 00:33:28,667
You know, in fact, if
anything, I failed her.

597
00:33:28,750 --> 00:33:29,833
-No.
-Yeah.

598
00:33:30,417 --> 00:33:32,459
So, when I did, what did I do?

599
00:33:32,542 --> 00:33:35,375
What did I do? I let
you go clean, right?

600
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:36,917
And why?

601
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,292
Why?

602
00:33:38,375 --> 00:33:39,834
'Cause you're an
honorable guy, Nico.

603
00:33:39,917 --> 00:33:41,375
Honorable Guy Nico.

604
00:33:41,458 --> 00:33:45,250
You had no problem letting a 15-year-old
girl play getaway driver for scumbags.

605
00:33:45,333 --> 00:33:48,542
I don't know if we should be tossing
around the word "honorable" right now.

606
00:33:49,417 --> 00:33:51,208
That's fair, Edith.
That's very fair.

607
00:33:52,042 --> 00:33:56,125
Well... thanks for
hearing me out.

608
00:34:14,458 --> 00:34:15,458
Johnny boy,

609
00:34:16,833 --> 00:34:20,250
if you don't have my three
million dollars by next Friday,

610
00:34:21,292 --> 00:34:23,625
I'm gonna have your skeleton
pulled out through your skin

611
00:34:23,708 --> 00:34:26,250
by a Haitian guy who does
it at a very fair price.

612
00:34:26,833 --> 00:34:28,792
-What's his name?
-Tim.

613
00:34:28,875 --> 00:34:30,375
Haitian Tim.

614
00:34:39,958 --> 00:34:42,250
Oh, you're still there.

615
00:34:50,500 --> 00:34:51,833
Yo, Edie, hold up.

616
00:34:53,625 --> 00:34:56,292
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Don't
have a heart attack!

617
00:35:00,792 --> 00:35:02,875
Yo.

618
00:35:03,667 --> 00:35:05,458
-So what are we doing?
-What do you mean?

619
00:35:06,042 --> 00:35:07,792
Oh, what Nico said.
You heard him.

620
00:35:07,875 --> 00:35:10,709
He's got, like, two guys on the
inside. Got that thing figured out.

621
00:35:10,792 --> 00:35:12,208
We do that shit in our sleep.

622
00:35:13,292 --> 00:35:14,584
Come on. You know
we've done harder.

623
00:35:14,667 --> 00:35:16,959
Yeah, but what the fuck
do I get out of it, huh?

624
00:35:17,042 --> 00:35:19,083
A chance to get
arrested, shot again?

625
00:35:19,583 --> 00:35:21,500
Are you... Are you
serious? You get...

626
00:35:21,583 --> 00:35:23,667
You get me being alive out
of it, Edie. You get me.

627
00:35:23,750 --> 00:35:26,500
Come on. Really, John? What...

628
00:35:26,583 --> 00:35:29,459
-Are you just gonna let this happen to me?
-You asked for this shit to happen to you.

629
00:35:29,542 --> 00:35:31,250
I bailed you out a lot of times.

630
00:35:31,333 --> 00:35:34,000
Come on, John. How many times are
you gonna throw that in my face.

631
00:35:34,083 --> 00:35:35,250
Are you serious?

632
00:35:36,833 --> 00:35:38,584
Do you know what I've been
doing since we broke up?

633
00:35:38,667 --> 00:35:41,459
-Look, we didn't break up. It's a break.
-Eight months is not a break, John.

634
00:35:41,542 --> 00:35:46,042
For the last eight months, I've been
going to work and going to school

635
00:35:46,125 --> 00:35:49,750
and trying to get as far
away from this shit as I can.

636
00:35:49,833 --> 00:35:52,292
Oh, oh, really? 'Cause I'm
pretty sure you came to my house

637
00:35:52,375 --> 00:35:54,250
three months ago and today.

638
00:35:54,333 --> 00:35:55,625
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

639
00:35:56,167 --> 00:35:58,250
Maybe that's because I
still keep punishing myself.

640
00:35:58,333 --> 00:35:59,875
Oh, okay. So I'm like
a punishment for you.

641
00:35:59,958 --> 00:36:01,958
Well, it always
works out that way.

642
00:36:02,792 --> 00:36:04,584
Maybe it's because I keep thinking
that whatever happened to me,

643
00:36:04,667 --> 00:36:06,500
whatever light bulb
that went on that said,

644
00:36:06,583 --> 00:36:09,417
"You gotta grow up and
maybe try for something,"

645
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:11,792
that it would
happen for you too.

646
00:36:13,333 --> 00:36:14,917
It never does.

647
00:36:26,417 --> 00:36:27,625
What are you gonna do?

648
00:36:27,708 --> 00:36:29,084
-What are you gonna do?
-I don't know. Maybe run.

649
00:36:29,167 --> 00:36:30,917
Oh, come on. You run, and
the next thing you know,

650
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,250
you're hanging upside
down by your asshole

651
00:36:32,333 --> 00:36:35,750
'cause you came back for a pack
of cigarettes or something stupid.

652
00:36:35,833 --> 00:36:39,334
Nico's got nothing better to do
than to track down and kill people

653
00:36:39,417 --> 00:36:41,708
he has personal
grievances with, okay?

654
00:36:44,583 --> 00:36:46,583
I gotta go, John. I gotta...

655
00:36:48,750 --> 00:36:49,750
I gotta go.

656
00:36:56,167 --> 00:36:57,917
We're written in the stars, Eds,

657
00:36:58,542 --> 00:37:02,917
with the sun and the moon and
every fucking thing else up there.

658
00:37:03,958 --> 00:37:06,917
The earth spins, but we're always
there when it comes back around.

659
00:37:08,208 --> 00:37:10,292
We always come back around, Eds.

660
00:37:12,667 --> 00:37:13,917
Oh, shit.

661
00:37:21,542 --> 00:37:23,667
Hey, brother. Can I
bum a smoke, please?

662
00:37:23,750 --> 00:37:24,958
Pl... Just one.

663
00:37:52,292 --> 00:37:53,292
Shit.

664
00:37:57,667 --> 00:37:59,042
What?

665
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,500
I'm gonna need a car.

666
00:38:06,708 --> 00:38:08,042
I got that guy on 105.

667
00:38:08,125 --> 00:38:10,333
Yeah, see what you can
get with... Hold on.

668
00:38:14,458 --> 00:38:15,708
How much money can I spend?

669
00:38:17,542 --> 00:38:20,542
You know, uh... I could think of a
few things we could do to make a deal.

670
00:38:21,083 --> 00:38:24,083
Come on, Stilts. I'm offering way
more than it's worth. Let's be real.

671
00:38:24,583 --> 00:38:27,417
Look, I didn't give you my number
'cause I'm some car dealer.

672
00:38:29,417 --> 00:38:32,167
Oh, shit. You should go.

673
00:38:35,708 --> 00:38:36,750
I need you to take the baby.

674
00:38:36,833 --> 00:38:38,209
It ain't my day, Deena.

675
00:38:38,292 --> 00:38:40,667
Look, I got a hair
appointment last minute.

676
00:38:40,750 --> 00:38:44,459
Since you ain't paid child support in
four months, you taking this motherfucker.

677
00:38:44,542 --> 00:38:46,834
Look, don't make me have to
tell the judge. Who is this?

678
00:38:46,917 --> 00:38:48,209
It's a business conversation.

679
00:38:48,292 --> 00:38:49,917
Business, my ass.
What does she want?

680
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,500
-That's none of your bus...
-To buy his car.

681
00:38:51,583 --> 00:38:52,917
How much?

682
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,083
-Do not...
-Forty.

683
00:38:56,125 --> 00:38:57,167
Oh, you taking that shit.

684
00:38:57,250 --> 00:39:01,917
I know I speak for me and the fucking
judge when I say you are taking that shit.

685
00:39:15,042 --> 00:39:16,292
Did you sleep with him?

686
00:39:16,375 --> 00:39:18,458
What? No.

687
00:39:19,708 --> 00:39:21,125
Did you sleep with
anyone? Since me, I mean.

688
00:39:21,208 --> 00:39:23,000
Are you fucking
serious right now?

689
00:39:24,458 --> 00:39:27,042
It's not a no. Ugh.
I'm fucking sick.

690
00:39:27,125 --> 00:39:29,459
That's what you're thinking about right
now? Me having sex with other people?

691
00:39:29,542 --> 00:39:31,709
-Don't say it. Don't say it like that.
-You're the one saying it.

692
00:39:31,792 --> 00:39:33,959
I know, but now I'm picturing it
'cause of the way you said it.

693
00:39:34,042 --> 00:39:36,209
Something is sick in your brain.

694
00:39:36,292 --> 00:39:38,459
-Oh, like you don't think about it.
-You having sex with other girls? No.

695
00:39:38,542 --> 00:39:39,792
Yeah, you do.

696
00:39:40,333 --> 00:39:42,875
You need help. You need
help. You're not normal.

697
00:39:42,958 --> 00:39:44,292
It's totally a normal thing.

698
00:39:44,375 --> 00:39:45,917
I'm way more "normaler"
than you are in this.

699
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,792
You know what, shut
the fuck up, Satan.

700
00:39:59,625 --> 00:40:01,667
You know what I'd do though,
if I ever found out who?

701
00:40:01,750 --> 00:40:05,625
Yeah, yeah, you'd stick
his dick through his face

702
00:40:05,708 --> 00:40:09,417
or kick his heart
up his ass or...

703
00:40:09,500 --> 00:40:11,209
-You've seen me do it.
-Yeah, I've seen it.

704
00:40:11,292 --> 00:40:12,750
And I happen to remember
you in the emergency room

705
00:40:12,833 --> 00:40:14,417
because Jimmy Pettrinelli
knocked you out.

706
00:40:14,500 --> 00:40:16,209
You know, he was a
wrestler by the way.

707
00:40:16,292 --> 00:40:18,375
He did that pussy-ass shit, and
then my head hit the pavement.

708
00:40:18,458 --> 00:40:21,125
Yeah, I'm just... Yeah.

709
00:40:21,208 --> 00:40:23,625
God, now it's in my head. Now I'm
picturing you and Jimmy Pettrin...

710
00:40:23,708 --> 00:40:25,042
Why would you say his name?

711
00:40:26,333 --> 00:40:27,500
Hey!

712
00:40:27,583 --> 00:40:30,167
I'm not spending the next week
relitigating our shit with you.

713
00:40:30,250 --> 00:40:31,542
The fuck is relitigating?

714
00:40:31,625 --> 00:40:34,375
How the fuck you been to court a hundred
times and not know what litigate means?

715
00:40:34,458 --> 00:40:37,167
Okay, all right. I know you're
like a hot-shit college girl now,

716
00:40:37,250 --> 00:40:39,708
but the rest of us still
live here on planet Earth.

717
00:40:43,708 --> 00:40:45,542
We're sharing a hotel
room though, right?

718
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,250
What? It's a good value.

719
00:40:49,958 --> 00:40:51,208
Oh, my God.

720
00:40:56,333 --> 00:40:58,250
Hey. Hey.

721
00:40:59,583 --> 00:41:00,500
What time is it?

722
00:41:00,583 --> 00:41:01,667
We're early.

723
00:41:02,417 --> 00:41:04,833
We can get beers. I bet
they have a pool table.

724
00:41:05,333 --> 00:41:08,125
Nico's guy's gonna be
here in less than an hour.

725
00:41:08,208 --> 00:41:09,500
Can you just once lay low?

726
00:41:09,583 --> 00:41:11,333
Come on, we can
make a few bucks.

727
00:41:15,875 --> 00:41:18,435
You're just mad 'cause it's the
one thing I'm better at than you.

728
00:41:21,250 --> 00:41:23,375
She's gonna meet
us there later.

729
00:41:23,458 --> 00:41:25,333
Man, get yo ass out here.

730
00:41:28,833 --> 00:41:30,167
You coming?

731
00:41:31,042 --> 00:41:32,042
Come on.

732
00:42:00,667 --> 00:42:01,667
I'm next.

733
00:42:50,667 --> 00:42:51,750
No.

734
00:43:00,542 --> 00:43:01,625
I'm next.

735
00:43:22,833 --> 00:43:24,417
John,

736
00:43:25,583 --> 00:43:27,375
can you get me
another drink, please?

737
00:43:44,583 --> 00:43:45,667
Fuck's sake.

738
00:43:48,667 --> 00:43:50,375
-Come here, motherfu...
-Enough!

739
00:43:53,917 --> 00:43:55,709
Which one's yours?

740
00:43:55,792 --> 00:43:57,667
Get the fuck off me. Get off me!

741
00:43:57,750 --> 00:43:58,792
That one.

742
00:43:58,875 --> 00:44:01,125
You two comedians, hit bricks.

743
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:03,917
Oh, shit. We have a Yankee fan.

744
00:44:04,667 --> 00:44:06,875
Come here, man. Come here.

745
00:44:07,542 --> 00:44:08,542
Have a good day.

746
00:44:09,125 --> 00:44:12,334
Let me... Let me see that. L-Let me
see that hat... so we can burn it.

747
00:44:12,417 --> 00:44:14,625
Now get the fuck out. Go.

748
00:44:15,500 --> 00:44:18,667
John, say sorry to Gary.

749
00:44:26,083 --> 00:44:27,292
Sorry, Gary.

750
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:30,000
Okay.

751
00:44:31,083 --> 00:44:33,708
Are we all ready to act like
professionals and go to work?

752
00:44:37,250 --> 00:44:40,542
Sorry, my wife got me on
this meal delivery thing.

753
00:44:41,125 --> 00:44:43,167
She thinks if someone could
be as handsome as Tom Brady,

754
00:44:43,250 --> 00:44:45,125
that he can be a great chef too.

755
00:44:45,208 --> 00:44:46,542
But she was wrong.

756
00:44:46,625 --> 00:44:48,625
Anybody want any pancakes
made out of sand?

757
00:44:49,583 --> 00:44:52,334
All right, Cole. Introduce
yourself like we in recovery.

758
00:44:52,417 --> 00:44:54,750
Cole, Head of Security
at the casino,

759
00:44:54,833 --> 00:44:58,209
and I am in recovery. So if
anybody wants this beer...

760
00:44:58,292 --> 00:45:00,542
Oh, yeah. I'll take it. My
glass smells like dog water.

761
00:45:01,625 --> 00:45:03,042
-Sorry, Gary.
-Fuck off.

762
00:45:03,125 --> 00:45:04,917
Okay, what are we up
against on the day?

763
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:06,667
A lot of off-duty
cops being brought in,

764
00:45:06,750 --> 00:45:09,000
and that's not including the
two dozen already on security.

765
00:45:09,083 --> 00:45:12,375
The money'll be secured in a prize car
just before the end of the tournament.

766
00:45:12,458 --> 00:45:14,250
When they get a hunch the
final game is wrapping up,

767
00:45:14,333 --> 00:45:17,209
security rolls it out from the
vault and feeds it into the trunk.

768
00:45:17,292 --> 00:45:20,542
Three guys move the payload, three cops
securing the perimeter around the car,

769
00:45:20,625 --> 00:45:22,625
six stationed outside,
four in cruisers.

770
00:45:22,708 --> 00:45:23,834
What kind of car?

771
00:45:23,917 --> 00:45:25,250
-The prize?
-Yeah.

772
00:45:25,333 --> 00:45:27,917
Kenny. Special events
for the casino.

773
00:45:28,708 --> 00:45:34,125
Dodge Charger Scat Pack. Fast.
Zero to 60 in 4.2. Manual.

774
00:45:34,208 --> 00:45:37,334
Manual? It's like they
wanted someone to steal it.

775
00:45:37,417 --> 00:45:38,500
Why do you think I picked it?

776
00:45:38,583 --> 00:45:41,959
First bump, outside of all
the cops and/or security

777
00:45:42,042 --> 00:45:45,000
is that they can't legally have
gas in it while it's on the floor.

778
00:45:45,083 --> 00:45:47,334
Well, that's a problem
since it runs on gas.

779
00:45:47,417 --> 00:45:48,667
Yeah, I fucked up on that one.

780
00:45:48,750 --> 00:45:50,917
So we create a
problem for this car.

781
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:54,584
Take it in the shop, rig the entire
car to our needs and send it back in.

782
00:45:54,667 --> 00:45:57,084
Or we switch it out with one
we start rigging tonight.

783
00:45:57,167 --> 00:45:59,125
Can we get an identical car?

784
00:45:59,208 --> 00:46:03,959
Yeah. I know the dealer. I work with
him all the time. Massive piece of shit.

785
00:46:04,042 --> 00:46:05,750
All right, we can talk
specs about the car later.

786
00:46:05,833 --> 00:46:07,459
What do we need the
car to do exactly?

787
00:46:07,542 --> 00:46:10,084
How far from the
display to the door?

788
00:46:10,167 --> 00:46:11,917
I'm more worried about
the crowd than the cops.

789
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:13,834
Meaning, you'd like to avoid hitting
innocent people on the way out?

790
00:46:13,917 --> 00:46:14,917
I would.

791
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:17,084
You won't be able to go through the front
entrance without doing a lot of damage

792
00:46:17,167 --> 00:46:19,042
to the car and maybe
a lot of people.

793
00:46:19,125 --> 00:46:21,083
I'm assuming you
have an alternative?

794
00:46:25,958 --> 00:46:31,000
The way the car came
in... from the back.

795
00:46:33,792 --> 00:46:34,792
She doesn't love it.

796
00:46:34,875 --> 00:46:37,667
It's a much more complicated
drive out of that place.

797
00:46:37,750 --> 00:46:39,875
Good news. Less
security at that exit,

798
00:46:39,958 --> 00:46:42,625
and who will be there
won't be expecting us.

799
00:46:42,708 --> 00:46:43,917
What about guns?

800
00:46:45,833 --> 00:46:47,167
And what about 'em?

801
00:46:47,250 --> 00:46:49,125
Will we be supplied them?

802
00:46:49,625 --> 00:46:52,334
I don't love that this is one
of your first questions, John.

803
00:46:52,417 --> 00:46:54,417
A lot of the guys on
security are my friends.

804
00:46:54,500 --> 00:46:57,292
Not on the day, they ain't. I
know Nico would say the same.

805
00:46:57,875 --> 00:47:00,167
Hey, if shit's a summer
breeze, shit's a summer breeze.

806
00:47:00,250 --> 00:47:02,292
Obviously that's what I prefer.

807
00:47:02,375 --> 00:47:03,959
-But that person right there...
-John.

808
00:47:04,042 --> 00:47:05,875
...that's my whole world.

809
00:47:05,958 --> 00:47:07,750
And if someone tries to
take that away from me,

810
00:47:07,833 --> 00:47:11,000
and shit goes from summer breeze
to wild wild west real quick,

811
00:47:11,083 --> 00:47:14,583
well, ride 'em, fucking cowboy.

812
00:47:19,458 --> 00:47:20,833
Okay, what else we got?

813
00:47:21,792 --> 00:47:25,000
We got you road maps of every in
and out from here to New York.

814
00:47:25,083 --> 00:47:27,042
Traffic will be a little
busier because of the event,

815
00:47:27,125 --> 00:47:29,667
but I'm guessing it'll be
manageable at that hour of day.

816
00:47:29,750 --> 00:47:31,334
Nico checked in with
his construction guys.

817
00:47:31,417 --> 00:47:34,459
Won't be any roadwork planned that
day to make things funny for us.

818
00:47:34,542 --> 00:47:36,250
Unless we want
'em to be funny.

819
00:47:36,333 --> 00:47:39,173
All you gotta do is say the word.
Anything else you need on the outside?

820
00:47:41,250 --> 00:47:43,625
-Just road.
-I can dig some up for you.

821
00:47:44,958 --> 00:47:46,500
-I'll give you a call later.
-All right, man. I appreciate it.

822
00:47:46,583 --> 00:47:48,000
Yeah.

823
00:47:48,083 --> 00:47:49,292
Yeah, man. Get some sleep.

824
00:47:49,375 --> 00:47:53,833
-Homeboy's gotta piss.
-Mmm. You got two minutes?

825
00:47:55,833 --> 00:47:57,292
Gary, is it cool
to use your office?

826
00:47:58,125 --> 00:47:59,500
Long as you don't
mind the ladies.

827
00:48:02,792 --> 00:48:05,833
You think Gary likes
Black women with big tits?

828
00:48:07,792 --> 00:48:09,042
There's some small tits too.

829
00:48:10,333 --> 00:48:13,458
Um, how many banks
have you robbed, Edie?

830
00:48:14,958 --> 00:48:16,042
You get right to it.

831
00:48:16,125 --> 00:48:18,250
Well, I'm in a room fully
furnished with pornography

832
00:48:18,333 --> 00:48:21,542
with a woman I don't know, so I'd like
to get out of here sooner than later.

833
00:48:22,333 --> 00:48:24,292
Banks. Robbed. How many?

834
00:48:24,375 --> 00:48:25,917
Helped rob. Enough. Too many.

835
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:29,542
Mmm, 12 banks, three jewelry stores,
a nightclub tycoon's corporate office,

836
00:48:29,625 --> 00:48:31,417
a certain football team
owner's summer home...

837
00:48:31,500 --> 00:48:33,209
That was impressive, by the way.

838
00:48:33,292 --> 00:48:36,250
Police helicopter, live
chase all caught on the news,

839
00:48:36,333 --> 00:48:39,417
and yet you are
here talking to me.

840
00:48:39,500 --> 00:48:41,625
If you're the Wikipedia of
all the bad shit I ever did,

841
00:48:41,708 --> 00:48:42,959
then why are you even asking?

842
00:48:43,042 --> 00:48:46,167
It's my job to sus out just exactly
who it is that I'm working with.

843
00:48:46,250 --> 00:48:49,417
Am I running this job, or
are you? 'Cause I'm confused.

844
00:48:49,500 --> 00:48:52,167
No confusion. It's your
job. One hundred percent.

845
00:48:52,250 --> 00:48:55,250
'Cause, you know, if... if
it's you, it's better for me.

846
00:48:55,750 --> 00:48:58,042
You pull it off, you're Mr. Big Shit
with the boss, and if you don't, well...

847
00:48:58,125 --> 00:48:59,333
Your boyfriend dies.

848
00:49:01,417 --> 00:49:02,334
-Ex.
-Is he though?

849
00:49:02,417 --> 00:49:04,417
-Hundred percent.
-Okay, because now I'm confused.

850
00:49:04,500 --> 00:49:05,500
Nothing to be confused about.

851
00:49:05,583 --> 00:49:07,500
There is. Most definitely.

852
00:49:08,167 --> 00:49:12,625
Because you've had a 100% success rate
all before you were 25 years old, Edie.

853
00:49:12,708 --> 00:49:13,959
-Not all.
-Oh, right.

854
00:49:14,042 --> 00:49:17,958
-And how'd those jobs go? Those, uh...
-...off-the-books jobs?

855
00:49:18,958 --> 00:49:20,000
-They went.
-Right.

856
00:49:20,542 --> 00:49:22,833
Because if they didn't, I
would've heard about it.

857
00:49:23,625 --> 00:49:26,292
And someone who gets talked about like
an urban legend, someone like that

858
00:49:26,375 --> 00:49:30,625
has very picky taste on how things
are done and who they're done with.

859
00:49:31,125 --> 00:49:32,500
Just say it.

860
00:49:32,583 --> 00:49:36,084
Edie, this is the
big black tits of me.

861
00:49:36,167 --> 00:49:40,209
I like to think of myself
as... ...uncommonly simple.

862
00:49:40,292 --> 00:49:43,709
When I'm home eating snacks, I bring
a little vacuum cleaner to my chair

863
00:49:43,792 --> 00:49:46,584
and suck up all the popcorn
that falls in my shirt as I eat.

864
00:49:46,667 --> 00:49:48,417
But my favorite thing in
the world is being home

865
00:49:48,500 --> 00:49:51,792
to make my son an egg salad sandwich
and walking him to the school bus stop.

866
00:49:51,875 --> 00:49:53,250
Your son likes egg salad?

867
00:49:53,333 --> 00:49:56,375
His teachers say he's unique.
And his mother's worried.

868
00:49:57,000 --> 00:50:00,667
However, there is something that
is complicating this picture for me

869
00:50:00,750 --> 00:50:02,625
in a way I do not like.

870
00:50:05,083 --> 00:50:06,875
-Your boy is a liability.
-There it is.

871
00:50:06,958 --> 00:50:09,834
I know it. Nico knows it. Every
low-level dope dealer, bookie,

872
00:50:09,917 --> 00:50:13,292
or small-time asshole up and down the
Midwest circuit of assholes knows it.

873
00:50:13,875 --> 00:50:15,209
And so do you.

874
00:50:15,292 --> 00:50:17,542
So I need to talk about John.

875
00:50:18,417 --> 00:50:19,917
Why don't you talk
to John yourself?

876
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:21,120
I thought this was your job.

877
00:50:26,042 --> 00:50:29,417
I, uh... I met
John when I was 15,

878
00:50:29,500 --> 00:50:33,375
right before I was extricated
from what social workers describe

879
00:50:33,458 --> 00:50:35,125
as a high-profile case.

880
00:50:37,208 --> 00:50:41,084
My high-profile case was that my foster
father, trying to make some extra money

881
00:50:41,167 --> 00:50:45,917
to score some dope, was trying
to sell my ass to some scumbag

882
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:48,000
in a parking lot of a 7-Eleven.

883
00:50:48,917 --> 00:50:49,834
Don't worry. It didn't happen.

884
00:50:49,917 --> 00:50:52,417
It didn't happen because someone
happened to see a crying girl

885
00:50:52,500 --> 00:50:56,958
trying to escape a car with two men who
very much fit the description of scumbag.

886
00:50:58,250 --> 00:51:01,000
-And that person was John.
-Was John?

887
00:51:04,250 --> 00:51:07,625
And instead of dope, my foster
father and that scumbag were dragged

888
00:51:07,708 --> 00:51:11,167
from that car and beaten within an
inch of their life by a kid who...

889
00:51:12,875 --> 00:51:17,292
by a kid who, up until recently, was by
my side for the better part of 15 years.

890
00:51:18,750 --> 00:51:22,334
-That's loyalty.
-Yeah.

891
00:51:22,417 --> 00:51:23,625
Respect that.

892
00:51:24,208 --> 00:51:26,709
I just think maybe your
loyalty to your boyfriend

893
00:51:26,792 --> 00:51:29,292
is threatening your
100% success rate.

894
00:51:29,375 --> 00:51:31,709
Maybe you'll like this.

895
00:51:31,792 --> 00:51:34,167
That job you mentioned, the
one you found so impressive,

896
00:51:34,250 --> 00:51:37,042
that was two police helicopters,
five news helicopters

897
00:51:37,125 --> 00:51:39,542
and eight staties on
our ass by the way.

898
00:51:39,625 --> 00:51:41,000
I guess I have to
update the Wikipedia.

899
00:51:41,083 --> 00:51:43,708
You might wanna jot down that
it was John driving that night.

900
00:51:45,208 --> 00:51:50,125
Not me. Because I had two bullets
in my neck and was unconscious.

901
00:51:51,917 --> 00:51:54,875
Thanks to him, I'm sitting here,
like you said, talking to you.

902
00:51:57,875 --> 00:52:00,625
And that's the big
black tits of John.

903
00:52:05,375 --> 00:52:06,792
Let's have a good week.

904
00:52:08,417 --> 00:52:11,708
-All good?
-As long as my union rep's taken care of.

905
00:52:12,333 --> 00:52:15,125
Said he's excited about breaking
ground on an in-ground swimming pool.

906
00:52:15,958 --> 00:52:17,292
That fat fuck can swim?

907
00:52:30,333 --> 00:52:31,333
Oops.

908
00:52:39,167 --> 00:52:40,417
Oh, no.

909
00:52:40,500 --> 00:52:41,875
-What are you guys doing?
-What happened?

910
00:52:41,958 --> 00:52:43,358
Come on. You can't do...

911
00:52:44,083 --> 00:52:45,542
I can't believe this.

912
00:52:45,625 --> 00:52:50,125
Like I promised, same exact car. Tits to
balls. No one's gonna suspect a thing.

913
00:52:50,208 --> 00:52:51,959
I see you're putting
that GED to good use.

914
00:52:52,042 --> 00:52:53,834
You piece of shit.
Fuck you, Mikey.

915
00:52:53,917 --> 00:52:55,709
Yeah, twice is enough for me.

916
00:52:55,792 --> 00:52:57,625
I hired her 'cause,
you know, she's smart.

917
00:52:57,708 --> 00:52:59,459
-Yeah, you fuck your mom.
-Yeah, whatever.

918
00:52:59,542 --> 00:53:02,292
-Yeah, fuck you.
-What a fucking slut.

919
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:05,542
Jesus. I'm on a sales call.

920
00:53:05,625 --> 00:53:07,667
Yeah, right. That guy
makes as many car sales

921
00:53:07,750 --> 00:53:11,834
as I make child support
payments. I don't.

922
00:53:11,917 --> 00:53:14,125
Uh, what did I say,
huh? Tits to balls.

923
00:53:17,833 --> 00:53:21,708
Tell you what, I'll, uh... I'll take a
little something off for you, all right.

924
00:53:27,417 --> 00:53:30,000
Oh, the security cameras,
they have night vision, yeah?

925
00:53:30,875 --> 00:53:34,292
What are you saying? Ow.
You wanna drive in the dark?

926
00:53:34,375 --> 00:53:37,667
She's saying if we switch the cameras to
night vision mode when the lights are on.

927
00:53:38,333 --> 00:53:40,583
<i>We put the cameras in the dark.</i>

928
00:54:04,042 --> 00:54:05,917
So what are we gonna
do about the gas tank?

929
00:54:06,500 --> 00:54:07,583
-I don't know.
-What?

930
00:54:10,417 --> 00:54:11,458
There, it's empty.

931
00:54:21,500 --> 00:54:23,208
All right, well, fuck
off. Go get to work.

932
00:54:39,458 --> 00:54:40,738
What is that? Kevlar?

933
00:54:47,542 --> 00:54:50,000
You're dead in the
water, homey. Dead.

934
00:55:07,167 --> 00:55:10,917
Whoo-hoo! Go, baby, go!

935
00:55:33,208 --> 00:55:34,292
I'm going to bed.

936
00:55:34,375 --> 00:55:35,959
I don't know if you saw, but
there's a sweet amount of per diem

937
00:55:36,042 --> 00:55:37,042
in these envelopes.

938
00:55:37,125 --> 00:55:39,334
Yeah, I'm still going to
bed, and you should too.

939
00:55:39,417 --> 00:55:42,875
-All right. Whose room?
-That's very funny.

940
00:55:45,500 --> 00:55:46,667
Is that who I think it is?

941
00:55:49,292 --> 00:55:50,875
No fucking way.

942
00:55:51,958 --> 00:55:53,292
Perm Walters.

943
00:55:55,042 --> 00:55:57,708
Edith Meaney. Child.

944
00:55:58,833 --> 00:56:00,584
-Oh, it's been a minute.
-Uh-huh.

945
00:56:00,667 --> 00:56:03,167
I'd like you to meet my date
for the evening. Gloria.

946
00:56:03,250 --> 00:56:07,875
It's an honor.
Pleasure. A thrill.

947
00:56:07,958 --> 00:56:09,417
Now join our little party.

948
00:56:10,667 --> 00:56:11,867
Yeah.

949
00:56:13,458 --> 00:56:14,458
Please.

950
00:56:26,750 --> 00:56:30,250
-So the competition.
-Not anymore. I thought you'd be grateful.

951
00:56:30,333 --> 00:56:31,542
Grateful? For what?

952
00:56:31,625 --> 00:56:35,084
For leaving you with the bulk of the
business. I heard Nico's keeping you busy.

953
00:56:35,167 --> 00:56:40,667
Well, if you feeling entitled
to a thank you, shit, thank you.

954
00:56:40,750 --> 00:56:44,584
And since you ain't working in the
morning, let me get you a drink.

955
00:56:44,667 --> 00:56:45,750
A shot.

956
00:56:47,542 --> 00:56:49,584
-No, thank you.
-Why?

957
00:56:49,667 --> 00:56:52,375
You got some other obligations
requiring you to keep shipshape?

958
00:56:55,250 --> 00:56:56,417
None for me. You?

959
00:57:00,125 --> 00:57:01,458
Nah.

960
00:57:02,292 --> 00:57:05,209
Just here celebrating the purchase
of my girl Gloria's new vehicle.

961
00:57:05,292 --> 00:57:06,709
Ain't that right, baby?

962
00:57:06,792 --> 00:57:11,084
Yeah. My baby's taking
care of me. Vroom.

963
00:57:11,167 --> 00:57:12,875
Oh, shit. Here it come.

964
00:57:14,042 --> 00:57:16,750
I seen them make one of these
on the hotel TV last night.

965
00:57:17,333 --> 00:57:19,459
-Hey, what's this called again?
-A Wildfire.

966
00:57:19,542 --> 00:57:21,584
-Wildfire.
-Wildfire.

967
00:57:21,667 --> 00:57:22,667
Watch this.

968
00:57:22,750 --> 00:57:25,875
-Ooh, shit. It's beautiful.
-Ooh!

969
00:57:27,042 --> 00:57:28,500
All right, Gloria. Baby,
let's blow 'em out.

970
00:57:28,583 --> 00:57:31,584
-Okay.
-There you go.

971
00:57:31,667 --> 00:57:34,583
-Cheers.
-Big sip now, Mama.

972
00:57:42,083 --> 00:57:44,500
-Whoo!
-Damn, that's... good.

973
00:57:44,583 --> 00:57:45,667
That's weird.

974
00:57:45,750 --> 00:57:48,500
I thought you'd avoid fire considering
all that shit on your face.

975
00:57:52,917 --> 00:57:56,000
Ain't nobody ever teach you that it's
rude to point out other people flaws?

976
00:57:56,083 --> 00:57:58,000
-Rude.
-I never did get the story.

977
00:57:58,083 --> 00:58:00,834
-What was it? A car accident?
-I don't get in car accidents.

978
00:58:00,917 --> 00:58:03,333
<i>What then?</i>

979
00:58:07,417 --> 00:58:09,458
<i>Let's just say the
cost of doing business.</i>

980
00:58:12,583 --> 00:58:16,708
Which reminds me. I owe
you one. Don't I, John?

981
00:58:17,208 --> 00:58:19,667
Well, we can always take
this outside, Freddy Krueger.

982
00:58:24,875 --> 00:58:26,958
Nobody has a sense
of occasion anymore.

983
00:58:27,625 --> 00:58:32,334
Old friends threatening
fisticuffs in nice hotels.

984
00:58:32,417 --> 00:58:34,042
So what is the occasion, Perm?

985
00:58:36,958 --> 00:58:41,250
Only time I seen my pops in a
suit was the day they buried him.

986
00:58:41,333 --> 00:58:44,292
Looking the best he's ever
looked for about an hour or two.

987
00:58:45,958 --> 00:58:49,125
Then they closed that
box, covered it in dirt.

988
00:58:49,792 --> 00:58:52,917
Nothing to celebrate,
except his own death.

989
00:58:55,083 --> 00:58:59,208
So when you ask me what the
occasion, life's the occasion.

990
00:59:00,042 --> 00:59:01,583
Sun up to sun down.

991
00:59:02,792 --> 00:59:04,542
That's the fucking occasion.

992
00:59:05,667 --> 00:59:08,500
They can bury me in my
pajamas when I'm in that box.

993
00:59:10,458 --> 00:59:13,167
Maybe I'll be the reason
someone buys you those pajamas.

994
00:59:14,708 --> 00:59:16,917
Or maybe I'll buy
your ass that suit.

995
00:59:22,917 --> 00:59:25,875
-Why is Perm Walters here?
-Here at this hotel?

996
00:59:25,958 --> 00:59:28,000
-Did Nico put him on this?
-He definitely did.

997
00:59:28,083 --> 00:59:29,625
Nico did not put
him on this job.

998
00:59:29,708 --> 00:59:32,584
So it's just a coincidence that Nico's
other driver just happens to be here

999
00:59:32,667 --> 00:59:34,459
on the weekend of a
job Nico put together?

1000
00:59:34,542 --> 00:59:38,334
Maybe he's here for the slots. Maybe he's
here for a Bat Mitzvah. I don't know.

1001
00:59:38,417 --> 00:59:42,125
All I do know is that Nico would not keep
me out of the loop on something like that.

1002
00:59:42,208 --> 00:59:43,292
Trust me.

1003
00:59:44,917 --> 00:59:45,917
Or don't.

1004
00:59:47,708 --> 00:59:49,125
<i>Why is Perm Walters
at the hotel?</i>

1005
00:59:49,625 --> 00:59:52,083
-I have no idea.
-Tell him we're getting fucked.

1006
00:59:52,750 --> 00:59:53,792
Tell John to shut the fuck up.

1007
00:59:53,875 --> 00:59:55,334
You understand that the
last time I saw that guy,

1008
00:59:55,417 --> 00:59:57,417
he tried to hijack my
job and shot me twice?

1009
00:59:57,500 --> 00:59:58,542
<i>I do.</i>

1010
00:59:58,625 --> 01:00:00,500
So you have no reason to
believe he's onto this job?

1011
01:00:00,583 --> 01:00:02,709
I don't think he's onto this
job because the only people

1012
01:00:02,792 --> 01:00:05,500
who know about this job is me
and the people doing the job.

1013
01:00:06,750 --> 01:00:07,750
I don't like it, Nic.

1014
01:00:09,417 --> 01:00:10,417
I'll ask around.

1015
01:00:19,042 --> 01:00:21,000
Hey, Nico. I know
you've been stressed.

1016
01:00:21,083 --> 01:00:22,959
You wanna know the best
thing for stress? Exercise.

1017
01:00:23,042 --> 01:00:25,375
So I picked you up one of these
portable seated ellipticals.

1018
01:00:25,458 --> 01:00:27,167
My Aunt Judy swore by it.

1019
01:00:27,250 --> 01:00:32,958
She used it every day until
she died of a heart attack.

1020
01:00:40,042 --> 01:00:45,250
I knew it. I don't trust those fucking
guys. That chaperone guy? Or fucking Gary?

1021
01:00:45,333 --> 01:00:48,708
Yeah. Why would Nico
put Perm on the job?

1022
01:00:49,458 --> 01:00:51,584
You're better than
him. So maybe not.

1023
01:00:51,667 --> 01:00:53,125
So it's just a coincidence?

1024
01:00:53,833 --> 01:00:55,750
No. No fucking way.

1025
01:00:57,417 --> 01:00:58,417
That's it.

1026
01:01:00,292 --> 01:01:02,500
-You think?
-Yeah. That's it. That's Perm's.

1027
01:01:02,583 --> 01:01:04,125
And it's a fucking work car.

1028
01:01:04,792 --> 01:01:07,750
Why would Perm let us know he's
here if he's not on the job?

1029
01:01:08,417 --> 01:01:09,583
You think he's that cocky?

1030
01:01:11,833 --> 01:01:14,500
He's wearing a fucking mink coat in the
middle of the afternoon on a Thursday.

1031
01:01:14,583 --> 01:01:15,667
What do you think?

1032
01:01:16,667 --> 01:01:18,500
So what now?

1033
01:01:22,417 --> 01:01:23,708
We need another driver.

1034
01:01:33,500 --> 01:01:35,917
I can do it. We don't
need another driver.

1035
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:38,333
You have your own job to
do. I'm not risking it.

1036
01:01:39,500 --> 01:01:42,667
Yo, nice digs.

1037
01:01:43,625 --> 01:01:44,625
Yeah.

1038
01:01:45,333 --> 01:01:46,733
You sure this is
the right address?

1039
01:01:48,167 --> 01:01:49,583
That's what it said.

1040
01:01:51,750 --> 01:01:55,167
Well, hello. I'm Rebecca.
You must be Edie.

1041
01:01:55,875 --> 01:01:58,458
Yeah, hi, uh... This
is... This is John.

1042
01:01:59,708 --> 01:02:01,542
Nice house.

1043
01:02:01,625 --> 01:02:04,500
Well, thank you. We've
been very blessed.

1044
01:02:04,583 --> 01:02:05,834
How many square feet is it?

1045
01:02:05,917 --> 01:02:09,709
Um... ...I don't know.
I'm not really...

1046
01:02:09,792 --> 01:02:13,583
Hey. Sorry. This chair isn't
as fast as I'd like it to be.

1047
01:02:14,500 --> 01:02:15,500
Hi, Dad.

1048
01:02:17,167 --> 01:02:18,167
Eds.

1049
01:02:22,708 --> 01:02:24,417
Hi, Mr. Meaney. I'm John.

1050
01:02:25,458 --> 01:02:26,458
Right.

1051
01:02:29,500 --> 01:02:30,625
Heard a thing or two.

1052
01:02:30,708 --> 01:02:33,084
Yeah. Me too.

1053
01:02:34,833 --> 01:02:37,458
Yeah, I'm sure you have.

1054
01:02:39,417 --> 01:02:41,125
Your call caught us by surprise.

1055
01:02:41,208 --> 01:02:44,750
But, um, I'm grilling up
a storm in the back there.

1056
01:02:44,833 --> 01:02:47,042
I just hope that, uh,
dogs and burgers are okay.

1057
01:02:47,125 --> 01:02:49,500
Kinda short notice, but
I should go check it out.

1058
01:02:49,583 --> 01:02:51,667
Whoa, hey, watch out!
I almost hit you.

1059
01:02:51,750 --> 01:02:55,292
-Again.
-Yeah. I ran over her toe once.

1060
01:02:55,375 --> 01:02:59,250
They're very unforgiving of, uh,
handicapped people in this house, right?

1061
01:02:59,875 --> 01:03:03,625
Say hello to Edie
and John, Sadie.

1062
01:03:04,667 --> 01:03:05,875
-Hi.
-Hi.

1063
01:03:06,625 --> 01:03:09,458
She'll warm up eventually.

1064
01:03:09,958 --> 01:03:11,667
Anyway, are you guys hungry?

1065
01:03:11,750 --> 01:03:12,833
I am.

1066
01:03:18,333 --> 01:03:19,458
Whoo!

1067
01:03:22,542 --> 01:03:23,542
Yeah.

1068
01:03:33,458 --> 01:03:34,542
Sunday driver?

1069
01:03:35,417 --> 01:03:36,417
If that.

1070
01:03:39,125 --> 01:03:41,845
Every once in a while a bunch
of gear head buddies of mine

1071
01:03:42,417 --> 01:03:47,084
drag out the old cars and hit
the burger joint a town over.

1072
01:03:47,167 --> 01:03:50,375
You know, a bunch of white hairs trying
to feel like their dicks still work.

1073
01:03:50,458 --> 01:03:53,125
You get used to the
hand controls thing?

1074
01:04:08,083 --> 01:04:09,250
Like races?

1075
01:04:09,833 --> 01:04:12,875
Or burning doughnuts in a Dunkin'
parking lot like when you taught me?

1076
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:18,083
I got, like, blown out a
couple times, you know.

1077
01:04:19,583 --> 01:04:22,584
And I go back a couple weeks
later, and I get so in the zone,

1078
01:04:22,667 --> 01:04:25,459
like I forget my
legs don't work.

1079
01:04:25,542 --> 01:04:26,750
I won a grand.

1080
01:04:27,583 --> 01:04:29,209
I thought you were reformed.

1081
01:04:35,500 --> 01:04:36,542
Edie, listen.

1082
01:04:36,625 --> 01:04:39,625
I got a job going
over at the casino.

1083
01:04:40,250 --> 01:04:41,292
Uh-huh.

1084
01:04:41,375 --> 01:04:43,333
John got into some
trouble, so...

1085
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:46,333
This one of those "do
or die" kind of jobs?

1086
01:04:51,167 --> 01:04:52,542
I could use another driver.

1087
01:04:55,958 --> 01:04:59,459
Um, I got a pretty good
thing going here, Eds.

1088
01:04:59,542 --> 01:05:02,959
-So no?
-I'm a 50-year-old man in a wheelchair.

1089
01:05:03,042 --> 01:05:06,000
-That I put you in. I'm very aware.
-Hey, it's not about that.

1090
01:05:07,375 --> 01:05:11,000
Eighteen years is a long time
not to go get your daughter.

1091
01:05:15,292 --> 01:05:18,375
I was a fucking drug
addict and alcoholic.

1092
01:05:19,875 --> 01:05:24,125
And there was no way in hell, with your
ma gone, with what happened to my legs

1093
01:05:24,208 --> 01:05:27,708
that I was gonna handle any
of this shit any better.

1094
01:05:29,500 --> 01:05:32,292
At the time, I thought
it was best for you.

1095
01:05:33,500 --> 01:05:38,083
Not to mention the burden I was.
Pissin' and shittin' myself.

1096
01:05:39,333 --> 01:05:43,583
Needing people to drag me out
of... out of a fucking wheelchair.

1097
01:05:45,083 --> 01:05:46,833
It's not the life
I wanted for you.

1098
01:05:49,417 --> 01:05:50,833
You should've let me choose.

1099
01:06:03,292 --> 01:06:04,292
You're right.

1100
01:06:11,625 --> 01:06:12,958
I'm sorry.

1101
01:06:19,042 --> 01:06:23,542
What did you used to tell me when,
uh... when I got in trouble at school?

1102
01:06:26,083 --> 01:06:29,750
"I don't accept 'sorries.'
I only accept change."

1103
01:06:32,667 --> 01:06:35,625
Can you, uh, move
so I can get out?

1104
01:06:36,583 --> 01:06:39,042
Eds.

1105
01:06:40,042 --> 01:06:41,042
Edie.

1106
01:06:44,917 --> 01:06:45,958
I did change.

1107
01:06:48,875 --> 01:06:49,875
Not for me.

1108
01:07:09,875 --> 01:07:12,042
Why didn't anybody
ever change for me?

1109
01:07:13,792 --> 01:07:14,792
What?

1110
01:07:16,292 --> 01:07:18,583
My ma, my dad, you.

1111
01:07:20,208 --> 01:07:21,417
It's not like that, Eds.

1112
01:07:22,083 --> 01:07:24,375
How many times you been to
rehab 'cause of a judge?

1113
01:07:25,375 --> 01:07:27,667
-I don't know. It doesn't matter.
-Six times.

1114
01:07:28,375 --> 01:07:30,667
Okay. Six times.

1115
01:07:30,750 --> 01:07:32,708
How many times have
you been 'cause of me?

1116
01:07:39,792 --> 01:07:46,042
The last time I went to rehab, it
was, like, day five, or something.

1117
01:07:46,750 --> 01:07:49,250
I got over being sick enough,
so they took us on this boat

1118
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:54,667
to, like, talk about what
made us take that first drink

1119
01:07:54,750 --> 01:07:57,000
or oxy or whatever.

1120
01:08:00,542 --> 01:08:02,417
I was getting ready for my turn.

1121
01:08:03,792 --> 01:08:05,625
I don't even remember
what I was gonna say,

1122
01:08:05,708 --> 01:08:10,542
but then I had this, like,
insane, um... What'd they call it?

1123
01:08:12,125 --> 01:08:13,208
Moment of clarity.

1124
01:08:15,042 --> 01:08:17,500
And I said, "I gotta get off
this boat and get to Edie

1125
01:08:17,583 --> 01:08:20,023
and tell her I'm gonna be clean
and it's all gonna be better."

1126
01:08:21,333 --> 01:08:22,333
And then I jumped.

1127
01:08:24,417 --> 01:08:25,708
I heard 'em all freaking out.

1128
01:08:27,458 --> 01:08:29,542
Turns out I wasn't healthy
enough to swim a mile and a half

1129
01:08:29,625 --> 01:08:30,875
in ice cold water in March.

1130
01:08:34,500 --> 01:08:35,792
When I was under there...

1131
01:08:37,792 --> 01:08:40,375
drowning or...
dying or whatever...

1132
01:08:43,958 --> 01:08:46,583
You know how they say your
life flashes before your eyes?

1133
01:08:51,208 --> 01:08:52,292
Well, all I saw was you.

1134
01:08:55,667 --> 01:08:57,083
Because you're my life.

1135
01:09:00,583 --> 01:09:02,083
I did everything you said.

1136
01:09:03,875 --> 01:09:08,292
I got clean. I stayed away from you
even though it fucked me up every day.

1137
01:09:09,167 --> 01:09:10,667
I tried to get jobs but...

1138
01:09:12,500 --> 01:09:16,083
it's like you asked me to
be this whole new thing.

1139
01:09:20,292 --> 01:09:23,083
This whole new person I
ain't ever been before.

1140
01:09:25,708 --> 01:09:27,125
That we'd never been before.

1141
01:09:29,500 --> 01:09:31,250
And I'm just supposed
to know how to do it.

1142
01:09:33,042 --> 01:09:35,042
And then I'm supposed
to do it without you?

1143
01:09:44,625 --> 01:09:46,333
Why couldn't you
just try it with me?

1144
01:09:48,583 --> 01:09:49,583
You know?

1145
01:09:52,333 --> 01:09:54,083
Why couldn't we
just do it together?

1146
01:09:56,958 --> 01:09:59,792
Hey. Hey. Hey.

1147
01:10:07,083 --> 01:10:08,250
Can we go?

1148
01:10:09,625 --> 01:10:11,250
I don't want your
dad to see me cry.

1149
01:11:12,667 --> 01:11:13,667
What?

1150
01:11:16,708 --> 01:11:17,708
I'm pregnant.

1151
01:11:18,500 --> 01:11:19,500
Fuck off.

1152
01:11:27,167 --> 01:11:28,833
-It's mine?
-Fuck off.

1153
01:11:29,833 --> 01:11:32,625
And I don't even know why I'm
telling you or what it means or...

1154
01:11:32,708 --> 01:11:34,292
-Why you're telling me?
-Really...

1155
01:11:34,375 --> 01:11:35,917
I'm just saying this
can't change anything.

1156
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:38,042
-This changes everything, Edie.
-No. John.

1157
01:11:38,125 --> 01:11:39,209
Everything.

1158
01:11:39,292 --> 01:11:41,542
-It's a family.
-John, I don't...

1159
01:11:41,625 --> 01:11:43,500
That's not a thing
I think we can be.

1160
01:11:44,250 --> 01:11:49,958
It's what we are already. A family.
You and me. It's just bigger.

1161
01:11:50,625 --> 01:11:52,250
A family doesn't rob a casino.

1162
01:11:53,958 --> 01:11:56,042
-And no kid should ever have to...
-Then why are you telling me then? Huh?

1163
01:11:56,125 --> 01:11:58,285
I don't know. Because
I tell you everything.

1164
01:12:00,542 --> 01:12:03,792
Look... we love each other.

1165
01:12:06,250 --> 01:12:07,292
You know I love you.

1166
01:12:08,125 --> 01:12:09,417
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

1167
01:12:11,333 --> 01:12:12,458
I know.

1168
01:12:15,833 --> 01:12:17,250
I just wish you'd stop.

1169
01:12:17,333 --> 01:12:19,167
Yeah, right. You just
wish you could stop.

1170
01:12:26,917 --> 01:12:29,667
-What are you doing?
-I'm listening for it.

1171
01:12:31,292 --> 01:12:34,250
It? It doesn't work like that.

1172
01:12:34,333 --> 01:12:38,125
-You don't know.
-I do.

1173
01:12:40,292 --> 01:12:41,292
You don't know.

1174
01:12:45,792 --> 01:12:46,792
You don't know.

1175
01:13:03,833 --> 01:13:04,833
John?

1176
01:13:13,458 --> 01:13:14,458
John?

1177
01:13:34,667 --> 01:13:36,500
I'm gonna have to
ask you to leave.

1178
01:13:38,875 --> 01:13:41,583
Where were you? All
your stuff was gone.

1179
01:13:42,083 --> 01:13:46,375
It's in the vents. I don't trust those
fucking maids. Do you? Fuck that.

1180
01:13:46,458 --> 01:13:47,792
Um...

1181
01:13:48,417 --> 01:13:52,125
Okay. We gotta meet the, uh,
chaperone guy soon. So...

1182
01:13:59,917 --> 01:14:01,917
Sorry it got a little
fucked up in my pocket.

1183
01:14:02,792 --> 01:14:05,250
Looked fancier when the lady
made it with a bow and shit.

1184
01:14:10,958 --> 01:14:12,500
Don't say nothing
about the money.

1185
01:14:13,083 --> 01:14:15,083
I only used the money that
we won at the racetrack.

1186
01:14:23,667 --> 01:14:26,209
It's a baby. A gold baby.

1187
01:14:26,292 --> 01:14:28,292
-Mm-hmm.
-All gold all the way through, she said.

1188
01:14:33,042 --> 01:14:34,042
Don't say thank you or nothing.

1189
01:14:34,125 --> 01:14:35,208
I wasn't gonna.

1190
01:14:36,542 --> 01:14:37,708
You love it.

1191
01:14:39,125 --> 01:14:40,875
It's a thank you
for, you know...

1192
01:14:40,958 --> 01:14:43,917
I save your life and
I get a gold baby?

1193
01:14:44,667 --> 01:14:45,709
We get a baby.

1194
01:14:55,875 --> 01:15:00,000
Okay. We should, uh... We
should go. You ready for this?

1195
01:15:01,542 --> 01:15:02,667
I'm ready for all of it.

1196
01:15:05,500 --> 01:15:06,875
<i>And we're back</i>

1197
01:15:06,958 --> 01:15:10,417
<i>at the Mid-Central Spring
Showdown Poker Series.</i>

1198
01:15:10,500 --> 01:15:14,292
<i>Two players battle for
$3 million in prize money</i>

1199
01:15:14,375 --> 01:15:17,792
<i>and a brand new Dodge
Charger Scat Pack.</i>

1200
01:15:25,500 --> 01:15:29,667
<i>And the flop comes.
Two, five, six.</i>

1201
01:15:29,750 --> 01:15:31,709
<i>Player leads off with 900.</i>

1202
01:15:31,792 --> 01:15:36,833
<i>Oh, my, he cold called. Thomas,
let's see our turn card. And it's...</i>

1203
01:15:57,417 --> 01:15:58,542
Yeah, baby.

1204
01:15:58,625 --> 01:16:02,125
I heard you loud and clear
the first time. No gambling.

1205
01:16:02,208 --> 01:16:04,250
-I love you.
-Love you too.

1206
01:16:09,500 --> 01:16:13,875
Killing me, Josh. I thought
we were friends, man.

1207
01:16:26,667 --> 01:16:28,667
<i>Here is our river.</i>

1208
01:16:34,250 --> 01:16:37,167
-I fucking love you, baby!
-I'm gonna fuck your brains out!

1209
01:16:38,708 --> 01:16:43,542
Ha! Yes! Yes! Yes! Whoo-hoo!

1210
01:16:43,625 --> 01:16:44,708
I've seen enough.

1211
01:17:09,333 --> 01:17:10,333
Hey. Bitch.

1212
01:17:13,208 --> 01:17:14,417
Fuck's sake.

1213
01:17:20,500 --> 01:17:21,834
Still feeling strong, bro?

1214
01:17:21,917 --> 01:17:23,834
Don't you think we should
take this outside, guys?

1215
01:17:23,917 --> 01:17:25,083
We should take this outside.

1216
01:17:28,083 --> 01:17:29,625
We got a situation
in the north wing.

1217
01:17:32,708 --> 01:17:35,042
Hey. Hey. Hey!

1218
01:17:35,125 --> 01:17:36,125
Hey! Break it up!

1219
01:17:36,208 --> 01:17:37,792
Glass me, bitch? Huh?

1220
01:17:37,875 --> 01:17:39,000
Call for backup.

1221
01:17:39,500 --> 01:17:41,833
I'ma need backup in here...

1222
01:17:49,750 --> 01:17:52,625
Jump out of the car.

1223
01:17:53,208 --> 01:17:54,125
Step out of the car!

1224
01:17:54,208 --> 01:17:55,417
Shut the car off.

1225
01:17:55,500 --> 01:17:57,460
-Get out now!
-Shut the car off!

1226
01:17:58,000 --> 01:17:59,208
Go get 'em, baby.

1227
01:18:01,750 --> 01:18:02,917
Cut the power!

1228
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:07,000
Shit.

1229
01:18:08,250 --> 01:18:10,083
Get out of the car!

1230
01:18:10,667 --> 01:18:11,708
Do it now!

1231
01:18:19,625 --> 01:18:22,500
Backwards it is.

1232
01:18:41,083 --> 01:18:42,292
Jesus Christ.

1233
01:18:42,375 --> 01:18:44,625
What are you doing?
Not in the casino.

1234
01:18:50,208 --> 01:18:52,250
Move! Get out of the way!

1235
01:19:09,125 --> 01:19:10,875
Think you could've pulled
up on the right hand a bit?

1236
01:19:10,958 --> 01:19:13,542
They didn't pay me
enough to pull back.

1237
01:19:24,875 --> 01:19:27,000
Get out of the car. Get
out of the car. Now!

1238
01:19:30,417 --> 01:19:31,458
Bulletproof.

1239
01:19:38,833 --> 01:19:40,834
She's headed for the loading
dock. Close the gate.

1240
01:19:40,917 --> 01:19:42,167
I got it.

1241
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:27,500
She's coming to you.

1242
01:21:48,167 --> 01:21:49,917
There you are, Perm.

1243
01:22:00,625 --> 01:22:01,917
Jesus.

1244
01:22:42,375 --> 01:22:43,625
-<i>Pull over.</i>
-Fuck.

1245
01:22:43,708 --> 01:22:45,628
-I'm trying to help you, dummy.
-<i>Pull over now!</i>

1246
01:23:22,833 --> 01:23:24,875
Get the fuck out of the
way. I'm Perm Walters.

1247
01:23:33,125 --> 01:23:34,542
Where are you, John?

1248
01:23:52,333 --> 01:23:53,458
There you are.

1249
01:24:26,458 --> 01:24:27,625
Shit.

1250
01:24:43,500 --> 01:24:44,583
John!

1251
01:24:45,333 --> 01:24:47,334
John!

1252
01:24:51,500 --> 01:24:53,083
John. Come on. Please.

1253
01:24:57,250 --> 01:24:59,917
John. No, please.

1254
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:02,667
John. John! John, wake up!

1255
01:25:03,167 --> 01:25:06,667
John. John. Come
on. Please. Come on.

1256
01:25:20,708 --> 01:25:22,875
John. Come on.

1257
01:25:27,417 --> 01:25:28,667
Come on.

1258
01:25:41,750 --> 01:25:44,583
Where's my money, Perm?

1259
01:25:47,958 --> 01:25:50,375
And why can't you just
get your own jobs?

1260
01:25:51,917 --> 01:25:57,208
I could but the best ones are the ones
where somebody already did the hard part.

1261
01:25:59,250 --> 01:26:01,042
How you find me though?

1262
01:26:01,542 --> 01:26:05,208
I know I swept that car for
bugs for about the last hour.

1263
01:26:07,458 --> 01:26:08,875
<i>You're not gonna find it, Edie.</i>

1264
01:26:08,958 --> 01:26:11,084
I hid that car and
the money somewhere

1265
01:26:11,167 --> 01:26:12,750
where your ass
ain't goin' never...

1266
01:26:12,833 --> 01:26:14,084
Shit.

1267
01:26:14,167 --> 01:26:17,084
Hid it really close by, I guess.

1268
01:26:17,167 --> 01:26:20,084
You wanna make this easy?
You win some, you lose some.

1269
01:26:21,917 --> 01:26:27,000
Isn't that what you
do real good? Lose?

1270
01:26:29,292 --> 01:26:32,458
John, what the fuck
happened to your face?

1271
01:26:33,625 --> 01:26:36,709
Ain't nobody every tell you it's rude
to point out other people's flaws?

1272
01:26:36,792 --> 01:26:39,125
Oh, I like that, man.

1273
01:26:39,208 --> 01:26:41,167
You use my own shit against me.

1274
01:26:42,458 --> 01:26:45,250
But look, a man knows
when he's cooked.

1275
01:26:46,625 --> 01:26:48,125
Edie!

1276
01:26:54,625 --> 01:26:56,250
What the fuck?

1277
01:26:57,500 --> 01:26:59,958
Fuck, fuck, fuck,
fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.

1278
01:27:03,708 --> 01:27:05,083
Sorry.

1279
01:27:16,125 --> 01:27:18,250
What's the occasion now, bitch?

1280
01:28:10,625 --> 01:28:13,042
Seriously?

1281
01:28:13,125 --> 01:28:14,500
-What?
-I look like this

1282
01:28:14,583 --> 01:28:17,625
-and you throw it in my face?
-Such a big baby.

1283
01:28:17,708 --> 01:28:20,750
-Just a big... ...baby.
-Yeah. Snack.

1284
01:28:27,125 --> 01:28:30,000
Hey. How long before
we can have another?

1285
01:28:30,500 --> 01:28:32,667
Like, medically?

1286
01:28:34,375 --> 01:28:35,792
-Medically?
-Yeah.

1287
01:28:35,875 --> 01:28:39,000
Wh... What does
that even mean?

1288
01:28:39,083 --> 01:28:40,167
You know what it means.

1289
01:28:41,167 --> 01:28:44,459
I'm worried we can't afford the first one.
You're thinking about having a second?

1290
01:28:44,542 --> 01:28:49,042
Hey, hey, hey. It's my turn to worry
about all that stuff now, okay?

1291
01:28:51,083 --> 01:28:52,458
I got this.

1292
01:28:53,625 --> 01:28:55,042
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

1293
01:29:04,875 --> 01:29:05,875
Okay.

1294
01:29:09,250 --> 01:29:10,250
Okay.

1295
01:29:12,500 --> 01:29:14,781
All right. Let's get
this money to Gary's.

1296
01:29:41,292 --> 01:29:45,375
When you're wrong, you are wrong.
I might owe you an apology.

1297
01:29:47,792 --> 01:29:49,042
Sorry, Gary.

1298
01:29:58,417 --> 01:30:01,042
Get in the car, babe.
Baby, get in the car.

1299
01:30:01,125 --> 01:30:03,042
-What did you do?
-Baby, get in the car.

1300
01:30:03,125 --> 01:30:04,417
What did you do?

1301
01:30:04,500 --> 01:30:07,250
Edie, we have to go. Now.

1302
01:30:14,833 --> 01:30:17,917
This is our shot.
The one we never had.

1303
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:19,417
We can start over.

1304
01:30:19,500 --> 01:30:23,500
Edie, I can change. For
you. For our family.

1305
01:30:24,083 --> 01:30:28,042
-Why? Wh... Why?
-Why?

1306
01:30:28,125 --> 01:30:31,458
I did it for us. For our family.

1307
01:30:32,167 --> 01:30:34,500
Three million dollars.
That's enough to disappear.

1308
01:30:37,833 --> 01:30:39,459
Edie, it's gonna be okay.

1309
01:30:39,542 --> 01:30:40,917
It's me and you. We'll...

1310
01:30:42,042 --> 01:30:45,959
We'll...

1311
01:30:46,042 --> 01:30:47,417
Fuck.

1312
01:30:49,417 --> 01:30:51,667
Fuck.

1313
01:30:54,208 --> 01:30:57,625
Okay. Okay.

1314
01:30:58,208 --> 01:30:59,958
We'll... We'll just
take it back, right?

1315
01:31:00,458 --> 01:31:04,542
Hey. He'll be happy just
to... I mean, all this money?

1316
01:31:05,125 --> 01:31:06,917
He always liked you, right?

1317
01:31:07,625 --> 01:31:11,208
That motherfucker always had a soft spot
for you, so you'll... You'll just, um...

1318
01:31:14,792 --> 01:31:16,208
I'm sorry.

1319
01:31:19,958 --> 01:31:23,000
What the fuck is wrong with me!

1320
01:31:24,417 --> 01:31:26,417
Okay.

1321
01:31:26,500 --> 01:31:29,334
Hey, hey. Hey.

1322
01:31:29,417 --> 01:31:33,334
It's okay. It's okay.

1323
01:31:33,417 --> 01:31:35,167
Okay.

1324
01:31:41,583 --> 01:31:43,250
We're written in the stars.

1325
01:31:45,167 --> 01:31:47,959
With the sun and the moon.

1326
01:31:48,042 --> 01:31:52,000
We always come back.
We always come back.

1327
01:33:39,958 --> 01:33:42,500
All right. A little dark in
there so watch your step.

1328
01:33:42,583 --> 01:33:46,458
Watch my step? Been watching these
steps for 30 fucking years, Georgie.

1329
01:33:47,542 --> 01:33:48,459
All right. Are you hungry?

1330
01:33:48,542 --> 01:33:51,333
I left a rotisserie chicken
in the fridge we can pick at.

1331
01:33:52,250 --> 01:33:54,167
How many times you gonna
fucking eat tonight?

1332
01:34:01,833 --> 01:34:03,292
Step outside, Georgie.

1333
01:34:13,208 --> 01:34:15,292
You want some tea?

1334
01:34:28,458 --> 01:34:29,792
You did the right thing.

1335
01:34:30,667 --> 01:34:32,167
The right thing?

1336
01:34:32,250 --> 01:34:34,167
The best thing. For you.

1337
01:34:36,125 --> 01:34:37,125
And for John.

1338
01:34:40,583 --> 01:34:42,208
You know what I was
gonna do to him.

1339
01:34:43,750 --> 01:34:46,833
I'm assuming you didn't know
George put Perm on the job.

1340
01:34:49,042 --> 01:34:50,042
Not until now.

1341
01:34:50,875 --> 01:34:54,000
Seeing as there was no point
in boosting the job for me,

1342
01:34:54,083 --> 01:34:56,292
seeing as I wasn't
gonna get a cut.

1343
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:03,125
Maybe I did.

1344
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:10,792
Georgie has been stealing
from me for years.

1345
01:35:13,708 --> 01:35:16,250
I stopped counting how
many... How much...

1346
01:35:18,042 --> 01:35:21,167
But he loves me. Georgie.

1347
01:35:22,125 --> 01:35:24,958
He loved me more than any woman
or any wife I've ever had.

1348
01:35:27,042 --> 01:35:28,875
Since we were kids.

1349
01:35:30,583 --> 01:35:32,417
And he could never help himself.

1350
01:35:32,500 --> 01:35:36,834
He could never distinguish those
two things that were contradictory.

1351
01:35:36,917 --> 01:35:38,875
Loving me and stealing from me.

1352
01:35:42,250 --> 01:35:43,500
That was Georgie.

1353
01:35:45,333 --> 01:35:47,917
I guess I needed to
always know that there was

1354
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:52,542
someone around that would
love me the way he loved me.

1355
01:35:57,958 --> 01:36:02,417
And now what? Who's
gonna do that now?

1356
01:36:16,875 --> 01:36:18,292
How many bathrooms do you have?

1357
01:36:20,042 --> 01:36:21,417
How many bathrooms I have? Two.

1358
01:36:21,500 --> 01:36:23,834
But the one upstairs,
the toilet is broken.

1359
01:36:23,917 --> 01:36:25,000
Get it fixed.

1360
01:36:26,833 --> 01:36:27,875
Get it fixed?

1361
01:36:30,083 --> 01:36:32,208
Why you obsessed with my toilet?

1362
01:36:34,500 --> 01:36:36,958
All through foster
care, even, uh...

1363
01:36:38,792 --> 01:36:40,917
even before then...
Before my ma...

1364
01:36:44,958 --> 01:36:46,625
Every house I lived in...

1365
01:36:46,708 --> 01:36:49,458
Some of those shitholes had,
like, six people living in 'em.

1366
01:36:50,167 --> 01:36:52,542
Every house only
had one bathroom.

1367
01:36:53,417 --> 01:36:55,375
Someone always
pounded on the door...

1368
01:36:58,542 --> 01:37:00,417
on the toilet while
you're in the shower.

1369
01:37:02,250 --> 01:37:08,667
And one day I was with my ma and we were
driving in a neighborhood like this...

1370
01:37:09,750 --> 01:37:13,334
Uh... I had to go. Like, go.

1371
01:37:13,417 --> 01:37:18,917
And, uh, my ma just knocked
on some lady's door.

1372
01:37:19,875 --> 01:37:21,583
I was horrified.

1373
01:37:23,833 --> 01:37:26,000
She let us in, the
lady that lived there.

1374
01:37:29,583 --> 01:37:33,667
She said to use the upstairs bathroom
'cause the downstairs one was messy.

1375
01:37:35,625 --> 01:37:37,167
That meant she
had two bathrooms.

1376
01:37:38,917 --> 01:37:41,500
Anyway, I just stayed
in there for ages.

1377
01:37:43,667 --> 01:37:45,375
No one was pounding on the door.

1378
01:37:50,708 --> 01:37:53,375
Later, my ma told me
the lady lived alone.

1379
01:37:55,875 --> 01:37:58,500
After that, anytime anyone asked
me what I wanted when I grew up,

1380
01:37:58,583 --> 01:38:00,542
I said a house
with two bathrooms.

1381
01:38:03,375 --> 01:38:06,917
In my fantasies or whatever, the
second bathroom would be for J...

1382
01:38:11,875 --> 01:38:13,292
Would be for John.

1383
01:38:17,792 --> 01:38:19,792
So he could keep his messy.

1384
01:38:23,542 --> 01:38:25,042
I could keep mine nice.

1385
01:38:32,542 --> 01:38:34,500
I'm still gonna get that house.

1386
01:38:39,917 --> 01:38:43,958
Get your bathroom fixed.

1387
01:38:53,417 --> 01:38:55,250
Take 10% for your troubles.

1388
01:38:55,333 --> 01:38:57,667
I already did. And
it's more like 20.

1389
01:39:04,208 --> 01:39:05,208
Eenie Meanie.

1390
01:39:07,875 --> 01:39:10,458
Always cleaning up
everybody's messes.

1391
01:39:14,083 --> 01:39:15,292
Not anymore.

1392
01:39:25,375 --> 01:39:28,167
Hey, Georgie? Come in here.

1393
01:40:58,042 --> 01:41:00,000
Hey, did you water the tree?

1394
01:41:00,083 --> 01:41:03,667
Bitch. I think your
Charlie-Brown-Peanuts-ass tree is dead.

1395
01:41:03,750 --> 01:41:06,250
Hey, I love that
Charlie-Brown-Peanuts-ass tree.

1396
01:41:06,333 --> 01:41:09,084
Yeah. And since you begged
for it, you should water it.

1397
01:41:09,167 --> 01:41:10,542
I got food to deal with.

1398
01:41:10,625 --> 01:41:12,834
Hi! Oh, that better
be chocolate.

1399
01:41:12,917 --> 01:41:14,209
Fifty percent of the time...

1400
01:41:14,292 --> 01:41:17,667
-...it is not chocolate.
-Do you have chocolate all over your face?

1401
01:41:17,750 --> 01:41:19,292
Come on in.

1402
01:41:19,375 --> 01:41:20,458
Oh, who's that?

1403
01:41:22,042 --> 01:41:23,750
Gosh, thanks for coming.

1404
01:41:27,042 --> 01:41:28,167
Hey.

1405
01:41:28,250 --> 01:41:29,667
Oh, yes, please. I will...

1406
01:41:32,333 --> 01:41:33,709
Hi.

1407
01:41:33,792 --> 01:41:35,917
John Jr!
