1
00:00:04,472 --> 00:00:06,074
So, hey guys!

2
00:00:06,107 --> 00:00:10,311
Um, found out the units
are shipping me off

3
00:00:10,344 --> 00:00:13,114
to St. Adeline again.

4
00:00:13,147 --> 00:00:14,482
Didn't matter what I said.

5
00:00:14,515 --> 00:00:16,817
They didn't hear me.

6
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:19,787
Um, I'm sure
some of you know

7
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:23,324
what that's like,
not to be heard,

8
00:00:23,357 --> 00:00:24,725
to feel like you're alone
in the world

9
00:00:24,758 --> 00:00:26,760
and no one cares.

10
00:00:26,794 --> 00:00:31,065
Um, that's why
I wrote this song,

11
00:00:31,099 --> 00:00:35,236
for you guys,
and I hope you like it.


14
00:00:53,454 --> 00:00:56,257
* Up in the air

15
00:00:56,290 --> 00:00:59,493
* You're always there

16
00:00:59,527 --> 00:01:03,431
* And I'm alone
trying not to show

17
00:01:03,464 --> 00:01:06,100
how much I care *

18
00:01:06,134 --> 00:01:08,702
* And do you see

19
00:01:08,736 --> 00:01:12,573
me trying to be *

20
00:01:12,606 --> 00:01:16,410
* Everything I think
that you would want

21
00:01:16,444 --> 00:01:20,448
or ever need *

22
00:01:20,481 --> 00:01:24,152
* All the static in my mind

24
00:01:27,155 --> 00:01:29,590
* I'm having trouble
trying to find *

29
00:01:53,514 --> 00:01:55,316
Ugh, Sara Croft.

30
00:01:55,349 --> 00:01:56,317
I can't believe
they're making me

31
00:01:56,350 --> 00:01:58,219
room with her again
this year.

32
00:01:58,252 --> 00:01:59,920
Doesn't sound so bad to me.

33
00:01:59,953 --> 00:02:01,355
I'm expecting you to be
on your best behavior

34
00:02:01,389 --> 00:02:02,356
this fall.

35
00:02:02,390 --> 00:02:04,492
Best behavior, got it.

36
00:02:04,525 --> 00:02:05,926
I thought we decided
you'd leave that at home.

37
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:07,628
You decided that, not me.

38
00:02:07,661 --> 00:02:08,896
I don't want you goofing off
with that thing.

39
00:02:08,929 --> 00:02:11,199
Absolutely.

40
00:02:11,232 --> 00:02:12,533
Hey, after what you did
this summer,

41
00:02:12,566 --> 00:02:14,668
you mess up again,
if I get one call

42
00:02:14,702 --> 00:02:16,770
from the Sisters, that's it.

43
00:02:16,804 --> 00:02:18,572
I'm sure he'll be fine.

44
00:02:18,606 --> 00:02:20,341
Zoe, Jason, welcome back.

45
00:02:20,374 --> 00:02:21,575
-Hi, Sister Rebecca.
-Hi.

46
00:02:21,609 --> 00:02:23,777
-Sister.
-Hi, Sister.

47
00:02:23,811 --> 00:02:25,446
I trust you all had
a wonderful summer?

48
00:02:25,479 --> 00:02:26,314
It was great.

49
00:02:26,347 --> 00:02:28,182
Mmhmm.

50
00:02:28,216 --> 00:02:29,417
Jason.

51
00:02:31,552 --> 00:02:32,553
Don't worry.

52
00:02:32,586 --> 00:02:33,954
We'll look after him.

53
00:02:33,987 --> 00:02:35,223
Thank you.

56
00:02:48,502 --> 00:02:50,638
Sister Sophia?

57
00:02:50,671 --> 00:02:52,206
Yes.

58
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:53,907
It's lovely
to finally meet you.

59
00:02:53,941 --> 00:02:55,576
So nice to meet you, too.

60
00:02:55,609 --> 00:02:57,311
Please, have a seat.

61
00:02:57,345 --> 00:02:59,347
Sorry things have been
so hectic around here.

62
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:00,714
It always takes
a couple of days

63
00:03:00,748 --> 00:03:02,750
for the kids to settle in
after the summer.

64
00:03:02,783 --> 00:03:04,852
It's understandable.

65
00:03:04,885 --> 00:03:06,487
So, I see you spent
the last three years

66
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:09,957
teaching at a school
in Missoula, Montana.

67
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:11,659
How was that?

68
00:03:11,692 --> 00:03:13,361
It was definitely colder.

69
00:03:13,394 --> 00:03:14,595
Well, the school had nothing

70
00:03:14,628 --> 00:03:16,597
but glowing things
to say about you.

71
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:18,432
And I loved everything
about teaching

72
00:03:18,466 --> 00:03:21,669
those young angels
the word of our Lord.

73
00:03:21,702 --> 00:03:23,504
Of course,
although I don't know

74
00:03:23,537 --> 00:03:25,539
what the protocol
was at St. Val's,

75
00:03:25,573 --> 00:03:26,807
but here we prefer
our teachers

76
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:29,243
wear no make-up,
of any kind.

78
00:03:43,424 --> 00:03:45,359
Over there is
the instructional building.

79
00:03:45,393 --> 00:03:47,595
Your classroom will be
on the second floor.

80
00:03:47,628 --> 00:03:49,797
The building across campus
is the boys' dorm

81
00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:51,732
and the girls' dorm
is right there.

82
00:03:51,765 --> 00:03:53,901
Better to keep them
as far apart as possible.

83
00:03:53,934 --> 00:03:55,336
-Absolutely.
-Ah, here's one

84
00:03:55,369 --> 00:03:56,937
of your students now.

85
00:03:56,970 --> 00:03:58,906
Jason Brady,
this is Sister Sophia,

86
00:03:58,939 --> 00:04:00,508
your new homeroom teacher.

87
00:04:00,541 --> 00:04:01,875
Hi.

88
00:04:01,909 --> 00:04:03,744
It's so nice to meet you.

89
00:04:03,777 --> 00:04:05,546
Jason is
our resident musician.

90
00:04:05,579 --> 00:04:07,648
And a bit of a celebrity
from what I hear.

91
00:04:07,681 --> 00:04:09,049
Really?

92
00:04:09,082 --> 00:04:10,818
You must be quite good.

93
00:04:10,851 --> 00:04:12,953
Uh, I'm okay.

94
00:04:12,986 --> 00:04:16,824
I'll, uh, I'll see you in class.

95
00:04:16,857 --> 00:04:17,925
Oh, don't take offense

96
00:04:17,958 --> 00:04:19,760
if Jason seems
a bit distant.

97
00:04:19,793 --> 00:04:21,295
He's been having
a hard time.

98
00:04:21,329 --> 00:04:22,996
-Why is that?
-Well, his grades

99
00:04:23,030 --> 00:04:24,465
have been falling
and he got into a bit

100
00:04:24,498 --> 00:04:25,566
of trouble this summer.

101
00:04:25,599 --> 00:04:26,434
Really?

102
00:04:26,467 --> 00:04:27,768
DUI.

103
00:04:27,801 --> 00:04:29,937
Wrecked
his father's car.

104
00:04:29,970 --> 00:04:32,540
Thank God
no one was hurt.

105
00:04:32,573 --> 00:04:34,842
Come.

107
00:04:39,913 --> 00:04:41,915
This is your room.

108
00:04:41,949 --> 00:04:43,351
It's not fancy
but we've never had

109
00:04:43,384 --> 00:04:44,652
any complaints.

110
00:04:44,685 --> 00:04:45,586
It's perfect.

111
00:04:45,619 --> 00:04:46,920
Good.

112
00:04:46,954 --> 00:04:49,423
Well, I'll leave you
to get settled in.

113
00:04:52,793 --> 00:04:56,564
Sister, we're very happy
you're here.

114
00:04:56,597 --> 00:04:58,566
Thank you, Sister.

120
00:05:34,902 --> 00:05:36,404
Hm.

122
00:05:39,507 --> 00:05:40,641
Forgive me for not praying

123
00:05:40,674 --> 00:05:42,976
as much as I should have
this summer.

124
00:05:43,010 --> 00:05:46,447
I'm working really hard
to get into Whittendale.

125
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:49,417
And that's all
I'm really praying for.

126
00:05:49,450 --> 00:05:51,485
That and my brother.

127
00:05:51,519 --> 00:05:54,021
He's getting into
a lot of trouble.

128
00:05:54,054 --> 00:05:56,590
He could really
use some guidance.

129
00:05:56,624 --> 00:05:57,625
Thank you.

130
00:05:59,159 --> 00:06:00,628
This is it, man,

131
00:06:00,661 --> 00:06:02,029
my last year
to bag Sara Croft.

132
00:06:02,062 --> 00:06:04,432
Pete, give it up already, man.

133
00:06:04,465 --> 00:06:05,999
Come on, she's practically
bagged everyone else.

134
00:06:06,033 --> 00:06:08,135
My chances have to be good.

135
00:06:08,168 --> 00:06:09,903
So, Jay, how many
fans you got now?

136
00:06:09,937 --> 00:06:11,705
I'm up to like 10,000.

137
00:06:11,739 --> 00:06:12,873
Dude, that is
such a babe score.

138
00:06:12,906 --> 00:06:14,475
You know that, right?

139
00:06:14,508 --> 00:06:16,710
Hey, did I ever tell you
you sing like a girl?

140
00:06:16,744 --> 00:06:18,446
That's not what
your sister thinks.

141
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:19,680
Hey, let's hit
the PS4.

142
00:06:19,713 --> 00:06:20,714
You coming?

143
00:06:20,748 --> 00:06:24,051
Maybe later, man.

145
00:06:29,623 --> 00:06:32,159
* Up in the air

146
00:06:32,192 --> 00:06:35,563
* You're always there

147
00:06:35,596 --> 00:06:39,733
* And I'm alone
trying not to show

148
00:06:39,767 --> 00:06:41,902
how much I care *

149
00:06:41,935 --> 00:06:43,837
* And do you see

151
00:06:49,109 --> 00:06:52,613
* Sky without the clouds

153
00:06:55,616 --> 00:06:58,886
* You're the voice
that laughs too loud *

155
00:07:01,855 --> 00:07:05,225
* You're the one face
in the crowd

156
00:07:05,258 --> 00:07:08,462
I always want around *

158
00:07:12,132 --> 00:07:15,903
* But I'm stuck
on the ground *

161
00:07:26,213 --> 00:07:27,948
That was beautiful.

162
00:07:27,981 --> 00:07:32,152
That was far better
than just okay.

163
00:07:32,185 --> 00:07:34,922
You're really talented,
Jason.

164
00:07:34,955 --> 00:07:37,658
Your parents
must be very proud.

165
00:07:37,691 --> 00:07:39,092
Yeah.

166
00:07:39,126 --> 00:07:40,594
Yeah, right.

167
00:07:40,628 --> 00:07:41,995
May I?

169
00:07:50,003 --> 00:07:51,639
Do you play?

170
00:07:51,672 --> 00:07:52,573
Um.

173
00:07:56,109 --> 00:07:58,679
Not really.

174
00:07:58,712 --> 00:08:01,214
You know, your lyrics,
they...

175
00:08:01,248 --> 00:08:04,685
...really speak
to you, don't they?

176
00:08:04,718 --> 00:08:07,655
Yeah, yeah, I guess
you could say that.

177
00:08:07,688 --> 00:08:09,189
You know, I get it, Jason.

178
00:08:09,222 --> 00:08:12,626
I know what it's like
to be misunderstood.

179
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:16,597
If you ever need
to talk, I'm around.

181
00:08:18,832 --> 00:08:19,833
Okay.

182
00:08:19,867 --> 00:08:21,835
I'll see you in class.

186
00:08:41,755 --> 00:08:43,123
Hey, rock star.

187
00:08:43,156 --> 00:08:44,992
You still in hot water
with your dad?

188
00:08:45,025 --> 00:08:46,660
Yeah, something like that.

189
00:08:46,694 --> 00:08:47,895
Well, we got the whole year

190
00:08:47,928 --> 00:08:49,797
to get you into
even more trouble.

191
00:08:49,830 --> 00:08:51,031
Looks like Sara
found someone else

192
00:08:51,064 --> 00:08:52,299
she hasn't bagged.

193
00:08:52,332 --> 00:08:53,834
Shut up.

194
00:08:53,867 --> 00:08:55,035
Good morning, class.

195
00:08:55,068 --> 00:08:56,670
Good morning.

196
00:08:56,704 --> 00:08:58,672
I'm your new teacher,
Sister Sophia.

197
00:08:58,706 --> 00:09:00,574
Good morning, Sister Sophia.

198
00:09:00,608 --> 00:09:02,275
Can't get more grounded
than I am.

199
00:09:02,309 --> 00:09:05,679
Yeah, you're always grounded,
I feel like.

201
00:09:07,247 --> 00:09:08,849
One day I'll get
visiting rights.

202
00:09:08,882 --> 00:09:10,317 
Can't wait.

204
00:09:14,087 --> 00:09:16,590
Toxic Tramp.

205
00:09:16,624 --> 00:09:17,991
Hmm.

206
00:09:18,025 --> 00:09:19,359
Now I understand
why you seem to have

207
00:09:19,392 --> 00:09:21,361
difficulty focusing Miss--

208
00:09:21,394 --> 00:09:23,831
Croft, Sara Croft.

209
00:09:23,864 --> 00:09:27,134
Well, Sara, how about
I help you focus?

211
00:09:41,815 --> 00:09:44,652
I trust that you'll
check your behavior.

212
00:09:44,685 --> 00:09:47,354
After all, you don't want
to go to Hell, do you?

213
00:09:47,387 --> 00:09:48,922
Whatever.

214
00:09:50,423 --> 00:09:51,659
Now.

215
00:09:51,692 --> 00:09:53,160
Where were we?

216
00:09:53,193 --> 00:09:54,361
Oh, how about
we take a look

217
00:09:54,394 --> 00:09:57,698
at your fancy
new textbooks?

218
00:09:57,731 --> 00:10:00,233
Uh, chapter one looks like
a great place to start.

219
00:10:00,267 --> 00:10:01,769
Uh, yes, Miss--

220
00:10:01,802 --> 00:10:04,805
Brady, Zoe Brady.

221
00:10:04,838 --> 00:10:06,907
Oh...

222
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:08,642
Yes.

223
00:10:08,676 --> 00:10:11,679
Shouldn't we start
with the Morning Prayer?

224
00:10:11,712 --> 00:10:13,113
Of course.

225
00:10:13,146 --> 00:10:16,684
Zoe, why don't you lead us?

226
00:10:16,717 --> 00:10:18,351
Give me, O Lord...

227
00:10:18,385 --> 00:10:20,821
I pray Thee firm faith,

228
00:10:20,854 --> 00:10:23,323
unwavering hope,
perfect charity.

229
00:10:23,356 --> 00:10:26,994
Pour into my heart the spirit
of wisdom and understanding,

230
00:10:27,027 --> 00:10:29,663
the spirit of counsel
and spiritual strength,

231
00:10:29,697 --> 00:10:31,832
the spirit of knowledge--

232
00:10:31,865 --> 00:10:34,101
Hey.

233
00:10:34,134 --> 00:10:36,036
Nice job getting in trouble
on your first day.

234
00:10:36,069 --> 00:10:39,206
I didn't get
in trouble.

235
00:10:39,239 --> 00:10:41,241
Do you know what's weird?

236
00:10:41,274 --> 00:10:45,212
Our new teacher, she didn't
say the Morning Prayer.

237
00:10:45,245 --> 00:10:46,880
So?

238
00:10:46,914 --> 00:10:49,149
So, that's like
sacrilege around here.

242
00:11:02,329 --> 00:11:04,164
The last thing you need
is a distraction

243
00:11:04,197 --> 00:11:06,166
like Sara Croft.

244
00:11:06,199 --> 00:11:08,936
God, Zoe, are you gonna
get on me like Dad now, too?

245
00:11:08,969 --> 00:11:11,004
Dad's not getting on you,
he's trying to help you.

246
00:11:11,038 --> 00:11:13,774
Well, then everybody
can stop trying to help.

248
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:28,889
Jason?

249
00:11:31,158 --> 00:11:34,728
-About this morning...
-Hey, look, I'm sorry, okay,

250
00:11:34,762 --> 00:11:36,797
I didn't mean
to interrupt your--

251
00:11:36,830 --> 00:11:38,431
No, it's okay,
you don't have to apologize.

252
00:11:38,465 --> 00:11:39,900
I just wanted to make sure

253
00:11:39,933 --> 00:11:42,169
that we got off
on the right foot,

254
00:11:42,202 --> 00:11:45,305
because I want this
to be a good year for you...

255
00:11:45,338 --> 00:11:47,908
and for me.

256
00:11:47,941 --> 00:11:49,476
Okay.

257
00:11:49,509 --> 00:11:51,444
So...

258
00:11:51,478 --> 00:11:54,414
This Sara...

259
00:11:54,447 --> 00:11:57,985
Is she your girlfriend?

260
00:11:58,018 --> 00:11:59,953
No.

261
00:11:59,987 --> 00:12:01,488
I don't have a girlfriend.

262
00:12:01,521 --> 00:12:03,323
Oh.

263
00:12:03,356 --> 00:12:05,859
I'm surprised.

264
00:12:05,893 --> 00:12:08,095
I'd think you were
quite a catch.

266
00:12:11,064 --> 00:12:13,100
Have a good night, Jason.

268
00:12:25,578 --> 00:12:30,283
* Trying not to show
how much I care *

269
00:12:30,317 --> 00:12:33,086
* And do you see

270
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:37,057
* Me trying to be

272
00:12:38,591 --> 00:12:40,393
* I think that
you would want

273
00:12:40,427 --> 00:12:42,395
or ever need *

279
00:13:16,229 --> 00:13:18,165
Hey!

280
00:13:18,198 --> 00:13:19,933
Hey.

281
00:13:19,967 --> 00:13:23,570
So, what do you think
about the new teacher?

282
00:13:23,603 --> 00:13:25,505
She's okay,
I guess.

283
00:13:25,538 --> 00:13:27,340
Well, I think
she's a bitch.

284
00:13:29,576 --> 00:13:32,579
You know,
I bet one day,

285
00:13:32,612 --> 00:13:35,348
you're going to be
even bigger than Bieber.

286
00:13:35,382 --> 00:13:37,250
Yeah, we'll see.

287
00:13:37,284 --> 00:13:39,352
Well, just in case,

288
00:13:39,386 --> 00:13:42,856
I think I should
take my chance now.

289
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:49,196
Miss Croft!

291
00:13:51,564 --> 00:13:55,302
I see you did not
heed my warning.

292
00:13:55,335 --> 00:13:57,437
Jason, get to class.

293
00:13:57,470 --> 00:13:59,206
Go.

295
00:14:04,311 --> 00:14:07,280
You're new here so I doubt
you know who my dad is.

296
00:14:07,314 --> 00:14:10,884
I mean, he like practically
pays for this school.

297
00:14:10,918 --> 00:14:12,953
I don't care
who your daddy is.

298
00:14:12,986 --> 00:14:17,557
Do not let me catch you
with that boy ever again.

299
00:14:17,590 --> 00:14:19,893
Now go to class.

303
00:14:44,451 --> 00:14:46,186
Jason?

304
00:14:46,219 --> 00:14:47,955
A minute please.

305
00:14:54,294 --> 00:14:55,929
You didn't think you were
gonna get off the hook

306
00:14:55,963 --> 00:14:58,065
that easy, did you?

307
00:14:58,098 --> 00:15:00,433
Besides, I thought you said

308
00:15:00,467 --> 00:15:03,303
that Sara wasn't
your girlfriend.

309
00:15:06,073 --> 00:15:07,640
Come to my chambers
after your last class

310
00:15:07,674 --> 00:15:11,078
and we'll have a word.

311
00:15:11,111 --> 00:15:12,112
I thought students
weren't allowed

312
00:15:12,145 --> 00:15:13,580
in the teacher's quarters.

313
00:15:13,613 --> 00:15:16,316
Well, they are
if they're invited.

317
00:16:20,213 --> 00:16:22,449
Sister Sophia?

318
00:16:22,482 --> 00:16:24,051
Whoa.

326
00:18:42,622 --> 00:18:45,292
You're a bad boy, Jason.

327
00:18:45,325 --> 00:18:47,660
You didn't come to see me.

328
00:18:47,694 --> 00:18:48,895
No, I'm sorry.

329
00:18:48,928 --> 00:18:51,798
I--I totally forgot.

330
00:18:51,831 --> 00:18:53,866
I'll let it slide.

331
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:55,668
This time.

334
00:19:01,608 --> 00:19:02,642
Hi, you two.

335
00:19:02,675 --> 00:19:03,943
How was your
first week back?

336
00:19:03,976 --> 00:19:04,877
Good.

337
00:19:04,911 --> 00:19:06,213
Good.

338
00:19:06,246 --> 00:19:08,348
-Hi.
-Hi.

339
00:19:08,381 --> 00:19:09,849
Hey, rock star.

340
00:19:09,882 --> 00:19:12,752
Got big plans this weekend?

341
00:19:12,785 --> 00:19:14,921
Hardly.

342
00:19:14,954 --> 00:19:18,291
Well, if you
get out on parole,

343
00:19:18,325 --> 00:19:21,228
you have my number.

344
00:19:21,261 --> 00:19:22,295
Okay, I got it,

345
00:19:22,329 --> 00:19:23,596
but let's see what happens.

346
00:19:23,630 --> 00:19:25,532
You know,
Sister Sophia,

347
00:19:25,565 --> 00:19:27,900
I know it's been
a change coming here.

348
00:19:27,934 --> 00:19:31,271
And we may not do things
the same way as at St. Val's.

349
00:19:31,304 --> 00:19:32,305
But if you ever
need anything--

350
00:19:32,339 --> 00:19:33,673
Bye.

351
00:19:33,706 --> 00:19:35,308
My door is always open.

353
00:19:38,645 --> 00:19:41,581
Actually, Sister Rebecca,
there is something.

354
00:19:41,614 --> 00:19:43,616
My Aunt Francis is ill

355
00:19:43,650 --> 00:19:46,619
and in hospice
at Mount Cedar.

356
00:19:46,653 --> 00:19:48,255
I'd like to go
visit her.

357
00:19:48,288 --> 00:19:49,789
Of course.

358
00:19:49,822 --> 00:19:52,225
Take as much time
as you need.

359
00:19:52,259 --> 00:19:54,727
I'll be sure to pray
the rosary for her.

360
00:19:54,761 --> 00:19:57,730
Just remember the kids
are back for mass on Sunday.

362
00:20:08,408 --> 00:20:09,909
It's so weird,
our new teacher didn't give us

363
00:20:09,942 --> 00:20:11,511
any homework,
and we should be studying

364
00:20:11,544 --> 00:20:13,280
for the SAT, which I'm
gonna have to do anyway

365
00:20:13,313 --> 00:20:14,914
if I want to get
into Whittendale.

366
00:20:14,947 --> 00:20:18,351
* I'm an overachiever,
baby, baby, baby *

367
00:20:18,385 --> 00:20:21,521
Well, that sounds
like a solid idea, Zoe.

368
00:20:21,554 --> 00:20:22,455
Hi, honey.

369
00:20:22,489 --> 00:20:24,891
Hey, babe.

370
00:20:24,924 --> 00:20:26,859
And what about you,
Jason, any plans?

371
00:20:26,893 --> 00:20:28,995
Well, I doubt I'm gonna get
into Whittendale.

372
00:20:29,028 --> 00:20:30,463
We don't expect that, honey,

373
00:20:30,497 --> 00:20:33,466
just that you, you know,
apply somewhere.

374
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:35,402
Actually I've been
thinking about that.

375
00:20:35,435 --> 00:20:37,970
I want to take a year off,
work on my music.

376
00:20:38,004 --> 00:20:39,739
Is it just me?

377
00:20:39,772 --> 00:20:41,441
Now that doesn't sound
like such a good idea.

378
00:20:41,474 --> 00:20:42,942
-I'll pay rent.
-So now you're talking

379
00:20:42,975 --> 00:20:44,944
about getting a job...
you know, Jason,

380
00:20:44,977 --> 00:20:47,314
once you quit school,
it makes it that much harder

381
00:20:47,347 --> 00:20:48,548
to go back, at least
if you're in school,

382
00:20:48,581 --> 00:20:49,782
you're working
towards something.

383
00:20:49,816 --> 00:20:51,017
I know what I want
to work towards

384
00:20:51,050 --> 00:20:52,619
it's just not what you want.

385
00:20:52,652 --> 00:20:54,321
That's not what
I'm expecting.

386
00:20:54,354 --> 00:20:55,922
Okay, then maybe
taking a year off

387
00:20:55,955 --> 00:20:57,790
isn't such a bad idea
and if he's paying rent,

388
00:20:57,824 --> 00:20:59,025
I think that's
very responsible.

389
00:20:59,058 --> 00:21:01,060
-Yes, yes.
-Yes.

390
00:21:01,093 --> 00:21:02,729
I just want him
to strive to be

391
00:21:02,762 --> 00:21:05,665
something more than
just a starving artist.

392
00:21:05,698 --> 00:21:07,500
What, so you don't think
I'll make it?

393
00:21:07,534 --> 00:21:10,537
-I'm not saying that.
-That's what it sounds like.

394
00:21:10,570 --> 00:21:11,571
And I'm gonna go be
a starving artist

395
00:21:11,604 --> 00:21:12,739
out back, okay?

396
00:21:12,772 --> 00:21:13,840
I'm gonna skip dinner.

397
00:21:13,873 --> 00:21:15,508
Jason.

398
00:21:15,542 --> 00:21:16,643
David.

401
00:21:23,350 --> 00:21:25,952
* All I am
and all I'll be *

404
00:21:30,857 --> 00:21:35,795
* Take me home

406
00:21:38,965 --> 00:21:42,869
* Even lovers forget
what beats in their chest *

407
00:21:44,671 --> 00:21:50,042
* I am

409
00:21:52,512 --> 00:21:54,414
* Home

413
00:22:01,688 --> 00:22:02,955
Hello?

414
00:22:02,989 --> 00:22:05,858
Hey, Sara.

415
00:22:05,892 --> 00:22:07,927
Tonight?

416
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:11,498
Yeah, I don't think I can,
I'm kind of still grounded.

417
00:22:11,531 --> 00:22:13,366
Yeah, I'm really on thin ice.

418
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:16,836
So, I'm just gonna have
to see you at school, okay?

419
00:22:16,869 --> 00:22:18,137
Cool.

420
00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:19,839
Oh, okay.

437
00:26:01,127 --> 00:26:04,631
Sister Sophia.

438
00:26:04,664 --> 00:26:08,601
What are you doing up here?

439
00:26:08,635 --> 00:26:10,937
I thought I might
have heard some rustling.

440
00:26:10,970 --> 00:26:12,171
Well, the kids
have been known

441
00:26:12,204 --> 00:26:14,173
to try and sneak out before.

442
00:26:14,206 --> 00:26:15,808
I trust you didn't
find anything.

443
00:26:15,842 --> 00:26:17,176
No, nothing at all.

444
00:26:17,209 --> 00:26:18,711
Everyone's sleeping.

445
00:26:18,745 --> 00:26:20,312
Good, just make sure

446
00:26:20,346 --> 00:26:23,282
you report any inappropriate
behavior back to me.

447
00:26:23,315 --> 00:26:26,052
We have a reputation
to uphold.

448
00:26:26,085 --> 00:26:28,254
Of course.

450
00:26:38,197 --> 00:26:40,933
Prude.

455
00:27:15,101 --> 00:27:18,337
Give me, O Lord,
I pray thee firm faith,

456
00:27:18,370 --> 00:27:21,440
unwavering hope,
perfect charity.

457
00:27:21,473 --> 00:27:25,244
Pour into my heart the spirit
of wisdom and understanding,

458
00:27:25,277 --> 00:27:28,047
the spirit of counsel
and spiritual strength,

459
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:30,917
the spirit of knowledge
and true godliness.

460
00:27:30,950 --> 00:27:32,752
Amen.

461
00:27:32,785 --> 00:27:34,353
All right, everyone,
let's review the homework

462
00:27:34,386 --> 00:27:35,888
that I gave you.

463
00:27:35,922 --> 00:27:38,991
Open your textbooks
to page 34.

465
00:27:47,867 --> 00:27:51,838
Sara Croft, what is that?

466
00:27:51,871 --> 00:27:54,040
I can't believe this.

467
00:27:54,073 --> 00:27:56,976
Marijuana.

468
00:27:57,009 --> 00:27:58,845
That's not mine.

469
00:27:58,878 --> 00:28:01,714
Really, then what is it
doing in your textbook?

470
00:28:01,748 --> 00:28:03,950
I don't know,
it's probably a joke,

471
00:28:03,983 --> 00:28:06,218
I mean, is it even real?

473
00:28:08,287 --> 00:28:09,255
Oh, it's real.

475
00:28:10,857 --> 00:28:14,426
And you, Miss Croft,
are in very big trouble.

479
00:28:24,070 --> 00:28:25,872
Well she's denied
any wrongdoing

480
00:28:25,905 --> 00:28:29,108
and insists she has no idea
how she came to have it.

481
00:28:29,141 --> 00:28:30,943
But still, we have
a very strict policy

482
00:28:30,977 --> 00:28:32,879
on illegal drugs.

483
00:28:32,912 --> 00:28:34,346
I've notified her parents

484
00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:37,049
and she will be
indefinitely suspended.

485
00:28:37,083 --> 00:28:39,118
Well, I'm concerned
that there may be

486
00:28:39,151 --> 00:28:41,420
more than one person
involved in this mess.

487
00:28:41,453 --> 00:28:45,191
These acts of wickedness
rarely happen in a vacuum.

488
00:28:45,224 --> 00:28:46,492
It may be prudent to proceed

489
00:28:46,525 --> 00:28:49,095
with a full inspection
of the school.

490
00:28:49,128 --> 00:28:50,496
After all, Sister,
you want to ensure

491
00:28:50,529 --> 00:28:53,432
that your school
is clean, right?

493
00:28:56,102 --> 00:28:58,771
All right, in light
of the circumstances,

494
00:28:58,805 --> 00:29:01,273
I don't think we have
any other choice.

496
00:29:06,846 --> 00:29:08,114
Well, there goes
your only chance

497
00:29:08,147 --> 00:29:10,382
at getting laid this year.

498
00:29:10,416 --> 00:29:12,318
Boys, if you don't mind
stepping into the hall.

499
00:29:12,351 --> 00:29:13,786
-What's the problem?
-We're conducting

500
00:29:13,820 --> 00:29:15,454
an inspection, this will
only take a minute.

501
00:29:15,487 --> 00:29:17,056
Let's go.

502
00:29:17,089 --> 00:29:17,957
-Move.
-I don't have any--

503
00:29:17,990 --> 00:29:18,891
I know.

504
00:29:18,925 --> 00:29:20,793
Move.

506
00:29:30,436 --> 00:29:32,071
Mr. Brady.

507
00:29:34,140 --> 00:29:37,476
Would you like
to explain this, please?

508
00:29:37,509 --> 00:29:39,812
-I've never seen that before.
-Then why was it found

509
00:29:39,846 --> 00:29:42,081
under your mattress?

510
00:29:42,114 --> 00:29:43,916
I don't know.

511
00:29:43,950 --> 00:29:45,384
Dude, don't look at me,
you're the alcy.

512
00:29:45,417 --> 00:29:46,953
Shut the hell up, man!

513
00:29:46,986 --> 00:29:48,855
Boys, that's enough!

514
00:29:48,888 --> 00:29:52,558
Mr. Robertson, could you
step into the room, please?

515
00:29:52,591 --> 00:29:54,994
Now.

517
00:29:57,263 --> 00:30:00,132
This is such crap,
I don't know whose that is.

518
00:30:00,166 --> 00:30:02,168
Listen, son,
all of us are tempted,

519
00:30:02,201 --> 00:30:03,936
we understand that.

520
00:30:03,970 --> 00:30:05,838
But the best thing to do here
is to tell the truth

521
00:30:05,872 --> 00:30:07,073
and get it
off your conscience.

522
00:30:07,106 --> 00:30:08,474
My conscience is clear.

523
00:30:08,507 --> 00:30:10,309
The evidence suggests otherwise

524
00:30:10,342 --> 00:30:12,311
and we can't just look
the other way, Jason.

525
00:30:12,344 --> 00:30:17,516
So you're gonna ruin my life
over something I didn't do?

526
00:30:17,549 --> 00:30:20,186
You don't believe me.

528
00:30:24,056 --> 00:30:26,525
Look, if my dad
hears about this,

529
00:30:26,558 --> 00:30:29,228
he'll kill me.

530
00:30:29,261 --> 00:30:32,264
Father, in light of this,
maybe we should give

531
00:30:32,298 --> 00:30:34,967
Jason a second chance.

532
00:30:35,001 --> 00:30:37,469
After all, it's alcohol,
it's not an illicit drug.

533
00:30:37,503 --> 00:30:38,604
Sister, the young man

534
00:30:38,637 --> 00:30:40,372
has struggled
with this before.

535
00:30:40,406 --> 00:30:42,408
We have to tell his parents.

536
00:30:42,441 --> 00:30:44,243
May I speak from the heart?

537
00:30:44,276 --> 00:30:46,045
Of course.

538
00:30:46,078 --> 00:30:48,180
We have all
struggled with sin.

539
00:30:48,214 --> 00:30:51,517
And we've all
been shown mercy.

540
00:30:51,550 --> 00:30:53,920
Perhaps if Jason
was to stay the weekend,

541
00:30:53,953 --> 00:30:55,387
and work around the school,

542
00:30:55,421 --> 00:30:59,091
and help the sisters
tend to the grounds,

543
00:30:59,125 --> 00:31:01,928
we could overlook
this little indiscretion,

544
00:31:01,961 --> 00:31:04,330
and just keep it
to ourselves.

545
00:31:04,363 --> 00:31:07,967
Jason, this sounds
like a proper penance.

546
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:11,237
What do you think, son?

547
00:31:11,270 --> 00:31:12,939
Okay.

548
00:31:12,972 --> 00:31:15,007
Sure.

549
00:31:15,041 --> 00:31:17,643
Thank you, Sister.

550
00:31:17,676 --> 00:31:20,379
Good.

551
00:31:20,412 --> 00:31:22,148
You know, Sister Sophia,
it was a wonderful act

552
00:31:22,181 --> 00:31:24,016
of mercy you showed
that young man.

553
00:31:24,050 --> 00:31:26,052
Well, I am truly blessed

554
00:31:26,085 --> 00:31:29,221
and I wanted to share
my happiness with everyone.

555
00:31:29,255 --> 00:31:30,389
I must say,
I find it so refreshing

556
00:31:30,422 --> 00:31:31,557
to see a young woman
like yourself

557
00:31:31,590 --> 00:31:33,225
taking the cloth.

558
00:31:33,259 --> 00:31:36,162
It's no secret that our
numbers are dwindling.

559
00:31:36,195 --> 00:31:39,065
So tell me, Sister, when did
you hear your calling?

560
00:31:39,098 --> 00:31:42,568
Well, it all started
with a song.

561
00:31:42,601 --> 00:31:45,337
-A song?
-That's right.

562
00:31:45,371 --> 00:31:47,539
I heard it one day
and it was if the songwriter

563
00:31:47,573 --> 00:31:51,310
was singing just for me.

564
00:31:51,343 --> 00:31:55,181
* Everything I think
that you would want

565
00:31:55,214 --> 00:31:59,151
or ever need *

566
00:31:59,185 --> 00:32:00,652
* All this started

567
00:32:00,686 --> 00:32:02,521
Mm.

570
00:32:08,394 --> 00:32:12,598
St. Adeline hires
Montana nun.

572
00:32:18,604 --> 00:32:20,072
Sister Sophia?

573
00:32:20,106 --> 00:32:21,340
Yes?

574
00:32:21,373 --> 00:32:23,976
(Laura)
Hi, Sister Sophia.

575
00:32:24,010 --> 00:32:26,278
My name is Candace,
Candace Fullman.

576
00:32:26,312 --> 00:32:27,646
I'm a member
of your congregation.

577
00:32:27,679 --> 00:32:29,548
I'm just a stone's throw.

578
00:32:29,581 --> 00:32:32,084
Oh, hello,
I haven't met you yet.

579
00:32:32,118 --> 00:32:33,452
I heard that
you've been transferred

580
00:32:33,485 --> 00:32:36,122
to a St. Adeline's School
in California?

581
00:32:36,155 --> 00:32:37,423
I'm afraid so, yes.

582
00:32:37,456 --> 00:32:38,557
I'm driving there right now.

583
00:32:38,590 --> 00:32:40,259
Today, all by yourself?

584
00:32:40,292 --> 00:32:41,760
Yes, I know it's crazy,

585
00:32:41,793 --> 00:32:44,130
but God has His way
of moving us

586
00:32:44,163 --> 00:32:46,498
around as He needs.

587
00:32:46,532 --> 00:32:50,302
I'm sorry to see you go.

588
00:32:50,336 --> 00:32:51,170
Oh, dear God.

594
00:33:06,052 --> 00:33:08,287
And that was it.

595
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:10,089
I knew what my calling was.

596
00:33:10,122 --> 00:33:11,123
What's the name
of the song?

597
00:33:11,157 --> 00:33:12,158
Ah, perhaps
we should have

598
00:33:12,191 --> 00:33:13,692
the choir sing it
this Sunday.

599
00:33:13,725 --> 00:33:16,295
Oh, well,
to be honest,

600
00:33:16,328 --> 00:33:18,530
it's more like
a pop song.

601
00:33:18,564 --> 00:33:21,667
It's one of my little
guilty pleasures.

602
00:33:21,700 --> 00:33:23,435
Oh well,
if that's all,

603
00:33:23,469 --> 00:33:26,405
I shouldn't feel
too guilty about that.

604
00:33:28,407 --> 00:33:30,476
So what am I gonna
tell Mom and Dad?

605
00:33:30,509 --> 00:33:33,512
Just tell them I volunteered

606
00:33:33,545 --> 00:33:36,615
to stay the weekend
to work, you know,

607
00:33:36,648 --> 00:33:39,685
to show my school
love and spirit.

608
00:33:39,718 --> 00:33:42,488
Oh, yeah, 'cause they're
gonna believe that.

609
00:33:42,521 --> 00:33:44,756
They will
if you say it.

610
00:33:44,790 --> 00:33:46,425
I don't know,
if they have questions,

611
00:33:46,458 --> 00:33:48,460
just have them call
Sister Sophia.

612
00:33:48,494 --> 00:33:49,695
Why?

613
00:33:49,728 --> 00:33:51,497
She fixed it.

614
00:33:51,530 --> 00:33:52,731
Why did she do that?

615
00:33:52,764 --> 00:33:55,801
She thinks I'm cool.

616
00:33:55,834 --> 00:33:57,403
Actually I'm gonna stay
the weekend.

617
00:33:57,436 --> 00:33:58,637
Why?

618
00:33:58,670 --> 00:34:00,406
To keep an eye on you.

619
00:34:00,439 --> 00:34:01,707
Zoe.

620
00:34:03,742 --> 00:34:05,477
Zoe, come on.

622
00:34:11,517 --> 00:34:13,219
Here, let me help you.

623
00:34:15,121 --> 00:34:16,155
Thanks.

624
00:34:18,724 --> 00:34:22,228
These flowers are so pretty
when they start to bloom.

625
00:34:22,261 --> 00:34:23,629
Yeah.

626
00:34:23,662 --> 00:34:27,399
So, tell me about your dad.

627
00:34:27,433 --> 00:34:28,767
He thinks I'm throwing
away my future

628
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:30,502
because I want
to be a musician.

629
00:34:32,738 --> 00:34:34,806
But it's the one thing
I'm good at, you know?

630
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:36,442
I'm never gonna be
a straight-A student

631
00:34:36,475 --> 00:34:38,377
like my sister.

632
00:34:38,410 --> 00:34:40,412
I'm just not.

633
00:34:40,446 --> 00:34:41,613
Trust me, I know
what it's like

634
00:34:41,647 --> 00:34:43,682
being something you're not.

635
00:34:43,715 --> 00:34:46,152
And it really sucks.

636
00:34:47,786 --> 00:34:50,656
It does really suck.

637
00:34:50,689 --> 00:34:54,893
Wow, it is so hot out here.

638
00:34:54,926 --> 00:34:56,295
Whoo.

644
00:36:05,697 --> 00:36:06,665
Sister Sophia?

645
00:36:06,698 --> 00:36:08,800
Shh.

647
00:36:18,777 --> 00:36:20,212
Sister Sophia.

648
00:36:20,246 --> 00:36:21,713
No, please.

649
00:36:21,747 --> 00:36:23,682
It's Sophia.

650
00:36:23,715 --> 00:36:25,784
Just Sophia.

651
00:36:25,817 --> 00:36:27,686
Remember how I said,
"It's hard being someone

652
00:36:27,719 --> 00:36:29,721
that you're not."

653
00:36:29,755 --> 00:36:31,657
I can't do it anymore.

654
00:36:31,690 --> 00:36:34,993
Not tonight...

655
00:36:35,026 --> 00:36:37,896
...because I didn't
choose this.

656
00:36:37,929 --> 00:36:41,967
And I get you, Jason.

657
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,870
Just like I know
that you get me.

661
00:37:06,725 --> 00:37:08,394
No, no, no, no, no,
I can't, I can't, I can't.

662
00:37:08,427 --> 00:37:11,363
I can't, I can't.

663
00:37:11,397 --> 00:37:13,265
Jason.

664
00:37:13,299 --> 00:37:14,733
This is wrong, this is wrong.

665
00:37:14,766 --> 00:37:15,901
I can't, I can't.

666
00:37:15,934 --> 00:37:17,269
It's okay.

667
00:37:17,303 --> 00:37:18,770
Come here.

669
00:37:21,707 --> 00:37:23,509
Please.

676
00:37:58,009 --> 00:37:59,845
Mm, oh God.

679
00:38:26,738 --> 00:38:28,640
Jason.

680
00:38:31,109 --> 00:38:33,645
Hey.

681
00:38:33,679 --> 00:38:35,581
Don't look so nervous.

682
00:38:35,614 --> 00:38:36,982
It's okay.

683
00:38:37,015 --> 00:38:38,817
No morning-after
regrets, all right?

684
00:38:38,850 --> 00:38:40,519
It's not that easy,
you're a nun

685
00:38:40,552 --> 00:38:41,820
and my teacher.

686
00:38:41,853 --> 00:38:42,888
I told you last night.

687
00:38:42,921 --> 00:38:44,456
I'm different.

688
00:38:44,490 --> 00:38:45,824
I don't belong here.

689
00:38:45,857 --> 00:38:47,793
Just like you.

690
00:38:47,826 --> 00:38:49,795
We're both misunderstood,

691
00:38:49,828 --> 00:38:52,531
which is why we can't say
anything to anyone,

692
00:38:52,564 --> 00:38:54,666
especially your sister,

693
00:38:54,700 --> 00:38:57,736
because if she finds out,
she'll go running to Daddy.

694
00:38:57,769 --> 00:38:59,838
Am I right?

695
00:38:59,871 --> 00:39:02,974
And then, well--

696
00:39:03,008 --> 00:39:04,342
Yeah.

697
00:39:05,977 --> 00:39:07,946
I should, um,
get to breakfast

698
00:39:07,979 --> 00:39:10,449
before it's over.

699
00:39:10,482 --> 00:39:11,617
Yeah.

705
00:39:45,517 --> 00:39:46,818
What are you doing here?

706
00:39:46,852 --> 00:39:48,153
Uh, looking for my brother.

707
00:39:48,186 --> 00:39:49,555
Well, he's not here.

708
00:39:49,588 --> 00:39:51,056
And you shouldn't be either.

709
00:39:51,089 --> 00:39:52,658
Or did you forget
about the rules

710
00:39:52,691 --> 00:39:54,693
about coming into
the boys dormitory?

711
00:39:54,726 --> 00:39:56,528
No, I was just
worried about him.

712
00:39:56,562 --> 00:39:59,030
Well, you should
go worry somewhere else.

713
00:39:59,064 --> 00:40:00,799
Why are you in his room?

714
00:40:00,832 --> 00:40:03,535
I'm conducting my rounds.

715
00:40:03,569 --> 00:40:06,705
Now, scoot,
before I call the Father.

717
00:40:13,945 --> 00:40:15,514
Hey!

718
00:40:15,547 --> 00:40:16,948
Hey.

719
00:40:16,982 --> 00:40:18,049
Are you okay?

720
00:40:18,083 --> 00:40:19,885
Yeah, why?

721
00:40:19,918 --> 00:40:21,520
I didn't see you
at breakfast.

722
00:40:21,553 --> 00:40:23,088
Oh, I wasn't hungry.

723
00:40:23,121 --> 00:40:24,690
I went to your room.

724
00:40:24,723 --> 00:40:26,625
Sister Sophia was there.

725
00:40:26,658 --> 00:40:27,959
-What?
-Yeah, she was,

726
00:40:27,993 --> 00:40:29,761
like, going through
your stuff or something.

728
00:40:33,932 --> 00:40:35,801
What's going on?

729
00:40:35,834 --> 00:40:37,002
I don't know.

730
00:40:37,035 --> 00:40:39,838
I--I don't know.

731
00:40:39,871 --> 00:40:41,172
Jay.

732
00:40:41,206 --> 00:40:43,909
Nothing's
going on, okay?

735
00:40:59,858 --> 00:41:03,495
All right, everyone,
that's it for today.

736
00:41:03,529 --> 00:41:06,097
Uh, Zoe, a moment please.

737
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:10,869
Zoe, I know how important
getting into college

738
00:41:10,902 --> 00:41:13,839
is to you, which is why
I was disappointed

739
00:41:13,872 --> 00:41:15,607
in your test result.

740
00:41:15,641 --> 00:41:17,075
Are you sure?

741
00:41:17,108 --> 00:41:18,510
I mean, I thought
I knew everything.

742
00:41:18,544 --> 00:41:20,245
Trust me, I'm sure.

743
00:41:20,278 --> 00:41:21,947
But don't worry.

744
00:41:21,980 --> 00:41:24,182
I want to give you
another chance.

745
00:41:24,215 --> 00:41:27,686
Come by after your last class
and you can take it again.

746
00:41:27,719 --> 00:41:28,920
Really?

747
00:41:28,954 --> 00:41:30,255
Really.

748
00:41:30,288 --> 00:41:31,990
Thank you.

751
00:41:55,814 --> 00:41:57,683
So is it just me
or does anyone else think

752
00:41:57,716 --> 00:41:59,217
-Sister Sophia's kind of hot?
-Hey, I'm already going to hell

753
00:41:59,250 --> 00:42:01,152
-for what I'm thinking of her.
-That ship has long

754
00:42:01,186 --> 00:42:02,721
-sailed, buddy.
-What the hell's

755
00:42:02,754 --> 00:42:04,690
-that supposed to mean?
-It means you can't

756
00:42:04,723 --> 00:42:05,724
have everything,
what do you want, Sara Croft,

757
00:42:05,757 --> 00:42:06,725
do you want Sister Sophia?

758
00:42:06,758 --> 00:42:07,826
What else do you want?

760
00:42:15,734 --> 00:42:18,604
Sister Sophia?

762
00:42:37,055 --> 00:42:39,257
What are you doing?

763
00:42:39,290 --> 00:42:42,060
Zoe.

764
00:42:42,093 --> 00:42:44,329
I would have never pegged
you as a cheater.

765
00:42:44,362 --> 00:42:46,264
No, I'm not, I mean--

766
00:42:46,297 --> 00:42:48,934
I think we need to go
see Sister Rebecca.

767
00:42:48,967 --> 00:42:50,902
Let's go.

769
00:42:54,139 --> 00:42:56,808
I caught her looking
at the test answers.

770
00:42:56,842 --> 00:42:59,911
Even after I was gonna
give her a second chance.

771
00:42:59,945 --> 00:43:01,680
Zoe, is this true?

772
00:43:01,713 --> 00:43:04,850
Honestly, I didn't mean to.

773
00:43:04,883 --> 00:43:06,284
It was just there and--

774
00:43:06,317 --> 00:43:09,020
And the temptation
was too great.

775
00:43:09,054 --> 00:43:13,659
Remember, lead us not
into temptation,

776
00:43:13,692 --> 00:43:19,197
but deliver us
from the evil one.

777
00:43:19,230 --> 00:43:22,300
Thank you, Sister Sophia.
That'll be all.

778
00:43:22,333 --> 00:43:24,369
Well, I hope that this prompts
immediate suspension,

779
00:43:24,402 --> 00:43:25,370
because quite frankly--

780
00:43:25,403 --> 00:43:27,773
I said, that'll be all.

781
00:43:34,212 --> 00:43:37,415
I am so sorry, Sister Rebecca.

782
00:43:37,448 --> 00:43:40,786
I admit, I did look at the test,

783
00:43:40,819 --> 00:43:42,954
but it was just there.

784
00:43:42,988 --> 00:43:44,990
I couldn't help but see it.

785
00:43:45,023 --> 00:43:48,259
Please, don't let
this affect my record.

786
00:43:48,293 --> 00:43:51,196
Zoe, I know how focused
and driven you are

787
00:43:51,229 --> 00:43:53,031
on your schooling,

788
00:43:53,064 --> 00:43:55,200
but you must stop and think
before you act,

789
00:43:55,233 --> 00:43:57,168
because Sister Sophia is right.

790
00:43:57,202 --> 00:43:58,704
Temptation is everywhere,

791
00:43:58,737 --> 00:44:00,906
and we need the resolve
to overcome it.

792
00:44:00,939 --> 00:44:03,374
Now, Sister Sophia
may seem strict,

793
00:44:03,408 --> 00:44:05,376
but she is very devout
in her ways.

794
00:44:05,410 --> 00:44:06,244
Not really.

795
00:44:06,277 --> 00:44:08,146
Excuse me?

796
00:44:08,179 --> 00:44:11,883
There's just something
different about her.

797
00:44:11,917 --> 00:44:13,685
She's not like
any of the teachers

798
00:44:13,719 --> 00:44:15,253
I've had at this school.

799
00:44:15,286 --> 00:44:18,023
Well, we're all different, Zoe.

800
00:44:18,056 --> 00:44:19,891
And Sister Sophia is
a very well-respected teacher.

801
00:44:19,925 --> 00:44:21,793
She doesn't say
the Morning Prayer.

802
00:44:21,827 --> 00:44:23,829
I don't understand.

803
00:44:23,862 --> 00:44:27,933
She asks someone in the class
to say it, and she doesn't.

804
00:44:27,966 --> 00:44:31,269
Well, whether we mouth
the words or not,

805
00:44:31,302 --> 00:44:34,239
God can still hear us as long
as it's spoken in our hearts.

806
00:44:34,272 --> 00:44:37,208
I want you to pray every night
for the next three nights,

807
00:44:37,242 --> 00:44:39,144
and ask for forgiveness.

808
00:44:39,177 --> 00:44:40,345
I will.

809
00:44:40,378 --> 00:44:41,479
Okay.

810
00:44:41,512 --> 00:44:42,914
Thank you, Sister.

811
00:44:42,948 --> 00:44:44,883
Of course.

821
00:45:30,161 --> 00:45:33,498
Forgive me, Father,
for I have sinned.

822
00:45:33,531 --> 00:45:35,834
It's been, like,

823
00:45:35,867 --> 00:45:38,303
a year since my last confession.

825
00:45:41,907 --> 00:45:46,978
I engaged in fornication...

826
00:45:47,012 --> 00:45:50,048
lust, whatever
you wanna call it.

827
00:45:50,081 --> 00:45:54,452
The problem is,
I know what I did was wrong,

828
00:45:54,485 --> 00:45:58,023
but I can't stop
thinking about it.

829
00:45:58,056 --> 00:46:00,325
It's like a part of me knows

830
00:46:00,358 --> 00:46:03,929
I'm probably going
to Hell for it,

831
00:46:03,962 --> 00:46:06,497
and the other part
doesn't really care.

832
00:46:08,867 --> 00:46:11,269
Is that bad?

834
00:46:13,104 --> 00:46:15,306
Father?

840
00:46:51,076 --> 00:46:53,211
Well, well, well.

841
00:46:53,244 --> 00:46:58,049
Bishop O'Reilly,
always a pleasure.

842
00:46:58,083 --> 00:47:00,085
It looks so beautiful, Sister.

843
00:47:00,118 --> 00:47:00,986
We've been waiting for you.

845
00:47:09,127 --> 00:47:12,964
So how did Sister Sophia fit
into your illustrious staff?

846
00:47:12,998 --> 00:47:14,933
Well, I think--

847
00:47:14,966 --> 00:47:16,868
You know I met her while
I was on a tour of the north.

848
00:47:16,902 --> 00:47:18,036
Really?

849
00:47:18,069 --> 00:47:20,005
It was about 30 below,

850
00:47:20,038 --> 00:47:21,973
and the school
that she was teaching at

851
00:47:22,007 --> 00:47:24,342
had lost the power
to its heating.

852
00:47:24,375 --> 00:47:27,512
Sister Sophia had the children
huddled in a circle

853
00:47:27,545 --> 00:47:30,648
pretending to be penguins
to keep warm.

854
00:47:30,681 --> 00:47:33,218
Really? Hm.

855
00:47:33,251 --> 00:47:34,485
You seem surprised.

856
00:47:34,519 --> 00:47:37,655
It's just, she seems
stricter here,

857
00:47:37,688 --> 00:47:40,558
more aloof.

858
00:47:40,591 --> 00:47:44,029
Well, the Sister Sophia I met
was truly a ray of sunshine.

859
00:47:44,062 --> 00:47:45,964
Huh.

860
00:47:45,997 --> 00:47:47,198
Bishop, why don't you
make yourself

861
00:47:47,232 --> 00:47:48,499
comfortable in the lounge,

862
00:47:48,533 --> 00:47:50,168
and I'll ask her to join us.

863
00:47:50,201 --> 00:47:51,202
Thank you, Sister.

864
00:47:51,236 --> 00:47:52,237
All right.

867
00:47:59,244 --> 00:48:01,012
Sister Sophia?

869
00:48:07,652 --> 00:48:09,387
Sister Sophia!

870
00:48:11,522 --> 00:48:13,091
Where you off to
in such a hurry?

871
00:48:13,124 --> 00:48:14,325
I'm so sorry.

872
00:48:14,359 --> 00:48:15,660
I just got a phone call
that my aunt

873
00:48:15,693 --> 00:48:17,462
has taken a turn for the worse.

874
00:48:17,495 --> 00:48:18,997
I'm on my way to hospice.

875
00:48:19,030 --> 00:48:20,165
I'm sorry to hear that.

876
00:48:20,198 --> 00:48:21,499
Is there anything we can do?

877
00:48:21,532 --> 00:48:24,035
No, it's in God's hands.

878
00:48:24,069 --> 00:48:26,004
Of course--I'm just sorry
you'll miss the chance

879
00:48:26,037 --> 00:48:28,506
to visit with Bishop O'Reilly.

880
00:48:28,539 --> 00:48:32,677
Yes, the Bishop, please,
send him my regards.

881
00:48:32,710 --> 00:48:36,647
Oh, I will.

882
00:48:36,681 --> 00:48:39,017
And we'll both say
a prayer for your aunt.

883
00:48:39,050 --> 00:48:41,086
Thank you, Sister.

890
00:49:18,189 --> 00:49:20,658
* We could fall

891
00:49:20,691 --> 00:49:25,530
* Come crashing down

892
00:49:25,563 --> 00:49:27,032
Here you go, sweetheart.

893
00:49:27,065 --> 00:49:28,499
Don't forget the tomatoes.

894
00:49:28,533 --> 00:49:30,601
You nut.

895
00:49:30,635 --> 00:49:32,703
So, there's a party
at Sara Croft's later.

896
00:49:32,737 --> 00:49:35,473
I was wondering if I could go.

897
00:49:35,506 --> 00:49:38,309
It's probably a better idea if
you stay in, do some studying.

898
00:49:38,343 --> 00:49:40,245
Maybe even look
at some colleges.

899
00:49:40,278 --> 00:49:42,313
Pass the salt, please.

900
00:49:42,347 --> 00:49:45,083
I already told you,
I want to take a year off.

901
00:49:45,116 --> 00:49:47,218
Oh, then maybe
you can explain to me

902
00:49:47,252 --> 00:49:49,320
exactly why we've
invested all this money

903
00:49:49,354 --> 00:49:52,090
the past 17 years sending you
to the finest schools.

904
00:49:52,123 --> 00:49:55,126
I didn't ask you to.

905
00:49:55,160 --> 00:49:56,661
You could have sent me
to public school.

906
00:49:56,694 --> 00:49:59,564
You did it so you could
show off to your friends.

907
00:49:59,597 --> 00:50:03,601
"My kids got into Whittendale."

908
00:50:03,634 --> 00:50:05,070
I got in trouble.

909
00:50:05,103 --> 00:50:06,771
Honey.

910
00:50:06,804 --> 00:50:08,539
Sister Sophia caught me
looking at test answers.

911
00:50:08,573 --> 00:50:10,241
Yes, but Sister Rebecca
understood.

912
00:50:10,275 --> 00:50:12,277
She didn't mean
any harm by it, David.

913
00:50:12,310 --> 00:50:14,479
That's because she's part
of the good flock.

914
00:50:14,512 --> 00:50:15,713
If I did it,
I would have been expelled.

915
00:50:15,746 --> 00:50:17,082
That's not true.

916
00:50:17,115 --> 00:50:18,416
No, Jason's right.

917
00:50:18,449 --> 00:50:21,652
It is absolutely
all about track record.

918
00:50:21,686 --> 00:50:24,189
And people will most assuredly
lose faith in you

919
00:50:24,222 --> 00:50:27,425
if you continue
to make mistakes.

920
00:50:27,458 --> 00:50:30,195
Pass the salad dressing, please.

921
00:50:30,228 --> 00:50:31,662
Thank you.

922
00:50:31,696 --> 00:50:35,533
No one gave you permission
to be excused.

923
00:50:35,566 --> 00:50:38,103
You can chalk it up
on my bad track record.

924
00:50:40,471 --> 00:50:42,473
David.

925
00:50:42,507 --> 00:50:44,409
* I'm stuck on the ground

926
00:50:44,442 --> 00:50:45,810
Wait, Jason.

927
00:50:45,843 --> 00:50:47,445
I'll talk to Dad.

928
00:50:47,478 --> 00:50:49,114
What's the point, Zoe?

929
00:50:49,147 --> 00:50:51,416
He's right--why should
he have any faith in me?

930
00:50:51,449 --> 00:50:54,152
I'm just a screw-up.

931
00:50:54,185 --> 00:50:57,122
Jason, no, don't!

937
00:51:20,845 --> 00:51:22,180
Hey.

938
00:51:22,213 --> 00:51:23,114
You bring your guitar?

939
00:51:23,148 --> 00:51:23,814
Naw.

940
00:51:23,848 --> 00:51:25,316
That's too bad.

941
00:51:25,350 --> 00:51:26,451
I was hoping
you could serenade me.

942
00:51:28,586 --> 00:51:30,855
I'll be back
at St. Adeline's, you know.

943
00:51:30,888 --> 00:51:32,490
My dad's working on it
right now.

944
00:51:32,523 --> 00:51:35,826
So that bitch Sister Sophia
can kiss my ass.

946
00:51:39,764 --> 00:51:41,266
Come on.

950
00:52:07,925 --> 00:52:09,760
Oh, God.

952
00:52:11,962 --> 00:52:13,398
I can't.

953
00:52:13,431 --> 00:52:15,166
What?

954
00:52:15,200 --> 00:52:17,435
Sorry, I got to go.

956
00:52:20,405 --> 00:52:21,872
Jason!

958
00:52:25,276 --> 00:52:27,212
Wait, Jason!

963
00:52:51,902 --> 00:52:54,171
Hey, you!

964
00:52:57,675 --> 00:53:00,878
You got some ID for that?

965
00:53:00,911 --> 00:53:02,513
I'll take that as a no.

966
00:53:02,547 --> 00:53:03,648
Keep your hands
where I can see 'em,

967
00:53:03,681 --> 00:53:05,283
step forward, please.

968
00:53:10,755 --> 00:53:13,391
Stop.

969
00:53:13,424 --> 00:53:14,692
Got anything in your pockets?

970
00:53:14,725 --> 00:53:18,263
I am so, so sorry, Officer.

971
00:53:18,296 --> 00:53:19,564
This is all my fault.

972
00:53:19,597 --> 00:53:21,932
I was left in charge
of watching him.

973
00:53:21,966 --> 00:53:25,270
He has a medical condition.

974
00:53:25,303 --> 00:53:27,305
He's making such great strides.

975
00:53:27,338 --> 00:53:30,641
God willing, and with the good
faith of people like yourself,

976
00:53:30,675 --> 00:53:32,743
we'll get him back
on the right path.

977
00:53:32,777 --> 00:53:35,813
He just needs a chance, please.

978
00:53:37,682 --> 00:53:39,317
All right, Sister.

979
00:53:39,350 --> 00:53:40,818
You just make sure
you get him home safe.

980
00:53:40,851 --> 00:53:44,422
And you, hey, that beer,
it stays here.

981
00:53:44,455 --> 00:53:47,525
God bless you, Officer.

982
00:53:47,558 --> 00:53:49,694
Good luck.

983
00:53:49,727 --> 00:53:50,895
Hey, I can't go
home like this.

984
00:53:50,928 --> 00:53:51,896
I promised my dad
I wouldn't drink

985
00:53:51,929 --> 00:53:52,997
after the accident.

986
00:53:53,030 --> 00:53:53,998
Then let's get you sober.

987
00:53:56,634 --> 00:53:59,437
I've been thinking.

988
00:53:59,470 --> 00:54:03,007
Would it be such a bad thing
if Jason took a year off?

989
00:54:03,040 --> 00:54:06,344
Gosh, he's struggling.

990
00:54:06,377 --> 00:54:08,379
Which is why a structured
environment like college

991
00:54:08,413 --> 00:54:10,515
would be good for him.

992
00:54:10,548 --> 00:54:13,918
Yeah, for some,

993
00:54:13,951 --> 00:54:15,453
like you.

994
00:54:15,486 --> 00:54:17,288
Maybe not for him.

995
00:54:17,322 --> 00:54:19,023
David, he's so lost.

996
00:54:19,056 --> 00:54:20,825
I mean, the boy we raised
wouldn't get in a car

997
00:54:20,858 --> 00:54:21,859
and drive drunk.

998
00:54:21,892 --> 00:54:23,594
So what's happened?

999
00:54:23,628 --> 00:54:25,330
Where did we go wrong?

1000
00:54:31,836 --> 00:54:33,571
I'm gonna go look for him.

1003
00:54:43,013 --> 00:54:45,383
So, what happened tonight?

1004
00:54:45,416 --> 00:54:48,786
Nothing, just my dad.

1005
00:54:48,819 --> 00:54:51,689
It was a good thing
I was looking out for you.

1006
00:54:51,722 --> 00:54:55,860
Can you get this, please?

1007
00:54:55,893 --> 00:54:58,529
I get your frustration, Jason.

1008
00:54:58,563 --> 00:55:01,466
My father never really
understood me either.

1009
00:55:01,499 --> 00:55:04,435
Thought I was a blight
on the family name.

1010
00:55:07,405 --> 00:55:08,873
But that's okay.

1011
00:55:08,906 --> 00:55:11,776
We don't need them anymore,

1012
00:55:11,809 --> 00:55:13,678
because we have each other.

1013
00:55:16,481 --> 00:55:19,116
You were following me.

1014
00:55:19,149 --> 00:55:21,819
I had a premonition
that you might need my help.

1015
00:55:21,852 --> 00:55:25,055
-Listen, Sister Sophia--
-It's Sophia.

1016
00:55:25,089 --> 00:55:27,858
Sophia, what we're doing
is wrong.

1017
00:55:27,892 --> 00:55:32,597
No, it's not.

1018
00:55:32,630 --> 00:55:34,665
I have money.

1019
00:55:34,699 --> 00:55:36,967
I have lots of money.

1020
00:55:37,001 --> 00:55:40,004
And I can give you
everything that you need.

1021
00:55:40,037 --> 00:55:41,672
I'll take you away.

1022
00:55:41,706 --> 00:55:43,741
I'll take you to Paris.

1023
00:55:43,774 --> 00:55:45,710
I can be your muse.

1024
00:55:45,743 --> 00:55:48,479
You can write beautiful
love songs about me.

1025
00:55:48,513 --> 00:55:51,015
And then no one
can keep us apart anymore.

1026
00:55:51,048 --> 00:55:53,684
No, I can't do this.

1027
00:55:53,718 --> 00:55:55,586
I'm not going anywhere with you.

1028
00:55:55,620 --> 00:55:56,921
This is sick.

1029
00:55:56,954 --> 00:55:59,089
Jason, don't say that.

1030
00:55:59,123 --> 00:56:00,725
I want to be left alone.

1031
00:56:00,758 --> 00:56:01,926
This was a big mistake,

1032
00:56:01,959 --> 00:56:04,028
and it's over, okay?

1033
00:56:04,061 --> 00:56:06,163
Is it her?

1034
00:56:06,196 --> 00:56:11,035
Is it that tramp that you went
to go see tonight?

1035
00:56:11,068 --> 00:56:12,503
Jason, you've been drinking!

1036
00:56:12,537 --> 00:56:13,604
I don't care!

1037
00:56:13,638 --> 00:56:16,441
Jason, please don't leave me!

1038
00:56:16,474 --> 00:56:18,943
Please, Jason!

1045
00:56:47,605 --> 00:56:48,606
Where are you?

1046
00:56:48,639 --> 00:56:51,976
Hey, I'm on Riverside.

1047
00:56:52,009 --> 00:56:53,978
Look, do you think
you can come pick me up?

1048
00:56:54,011 --> 00:56:55,646
Just don't say anything
to Mom and Dad, please.

1049
00:56:55,680 --> 00:56:58,549
I can't, Dad took the car.

1050
00:56:58,583 --> 00:57:00,017
He's out looking for you.

1053
00:57:26,744 --> 00:57:28,879
Hey.

1054
00:57:28,913 --> 00:57:30,047
Hey.

1055
00:57:33,183 --> 00:57:35,486
What the heck
are ya doing out here?

1056
00:57:36,821 --> 00:57:37,922
Was out with
a couple of the guys

1057
00:57:37,955 --> 00:57:40,558
and just wanted
to be alone

1058
00:57:40,591 --> 00:57:41,826
to think, you know.

1059
00:57:43,528 --> 00:57:49,534
Okay, well,
I can appreciate that.

1060
00:57:49,567 --> 00:57:52,269
I've been doing
some thinking myself.

1061
00:57:52,302 --> 00:57:55,072
And I've decided...

1063
00:57:58,909 --> 00:58:00,945
...you're right,

1064
00:58:00,978 --> 00:58:03,814
I've been pushing you
in a direction

1065
00:58:03,848 --> 00:58:05,716
probably better suited
for me than for you.

1066
00:58:05,750 --> 00:58:10,120
And I'm sorry.

1068
00:58:13,157 --> 00:58:17,662
What do you say
we figure out a plan,

1069
00:58:17,695 --> 00:58:20,931
one that you're happy with
and one that I can live with

1070
00:58:20,965 --> 00:58:22,567
knowing that
you're gonna be okay.

1071
00:58:25,570 --> 00:58:27,271
Okay.

1072
00:58:27,304 --> 00:58:29,139
Good.

1074
00:58:31,041 --> 00:58:33,878
Just for the record,

1075
00:58:33,911 --> 00:58:38,082
I haven't lost
faith in you...

1076
00:58:38,115 --> 00:58:39,516
and I never will.

1077
00:58:41,118 --> 00:58:43,053
Thanks, Dad.

1081
00:58:57,902 --> 00:59:01,238
Well, why don't you
head on up to bed

1082
00:59:01,271 --> 00:59:03,207
and get some rest.

1085
00:59:13,984 --> 00:59:14,852
Come on, pick it up, sweetie.

1086
00:59:14,885 --> 00:59:16,186
We are late.

1087
00:59:16,220 --> 00:59:18,555
Come on, you can do it.

1090
00:59:36,941 --> 00:59:38,843
Come on, Zoe.

1091
00:59:38,876 --> 00:59:39,977
I don't want to be late
getting you back to school.

1092
00:59:40,010 --> 00:59:40,845
Let's go.

1094
00:59:43,280 --> 00:59:46,751
Resist the Devil,
and he will flee from you.

1095
00:59:46,784 --> 00:59:48,686
Draw near to God,

1096
00:59:48,719 --> 00:59:51,255
and God will draw near to you.

1097
00:59:51,288 --> 00:59:56,093
Cleanse your hands,
purify your hearts,

1098
00:59:56,126 --> 00:59:58,262
you of two minds.

1099
00:59:58,295 --> 01:00:04,902
Begin to lament,
to mourn, to weep.

1100
01:00:04,935 --> 01:00:08,706
Let your laughter
be turned into mourning,

1101
01:00:08,739 --> 01:00:12,176
your joy into dejection.

1102
01:00:12,209 --> 01:00:15,079
Humble yourself
before the Lord,

1103
01:00:15,112 --> 01:00:20,117
and He will exalt you
to the highest mountain.

1104
01:00:20,150 --> 01:00:24,922
It is only when we stop
listening that we go astray.

1110
01:01:03,894 --> 01:01:05,963
Sister Sophia, hey, hey,

1111
01:01:05,996 --> 01:01:07,932
Sister Sophia, what did you--?

1112
01:01:07,965 --> 01:01:08,766
What did you--?

1113
01:01:08,799 --> 01:01:09,466
Hey, hey, wake up.

1114
01:01:09,499 --> 01:01:10,434
Wake up, wake up.

1115
01:01:10,467 --> 01:01:11,468
Hey, come on.

1116
01:01:11,501 --> 01:01:13,270
Oh, my God.

1117
01:01:13,303 --> 01:01:15,039
Hey, hey, come here.

1118
01:01:15,072 --> 01:01:16,173
Come, come here.

1119
01:01:16,206 --> 01:01:18,142
Come here.

1121
01:01:21,478 --> 01:01:23,480
Okay, okay.

1123
01:01:29,987 --> 01:01:33,157
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1124
01:01:33,190 --> 01:01:36,160
I knew you would try to save me.

1125
01:01:36,193 --> 01:01:38,328
You do love me.

1126
01:01:38,362 --> 01:01:40,097
You were faking that?

1127
01:01:40,130 --> 01:01:42,266
After all the horrible
things you said,

1128
01:01:42,299 --> 01:01:45,202
I almost thought about
really killing myself.

1129
01:01:45,235 --> 01:01:47,371
But I know that
you didn't mean it.

1130
01:01:47,404 --> 01:01:50,875
Okay, I'm gonna report you
to Father Macey.

1131
01:01:50,908 --> 01:01:52,877
Do it.

1132
01:01:52,910 --> 01:01:55,913
Oh, the scandal, Jason.

1133
01:01:55,946 --> 01:01:57,414
You would forever be remembered

1134
01:01:57,447 --> 01:02:00,851
as the boy
who slept with the nun.

1135
01:02:00,885 --> 01:02:02,452
Somehow I doubt
that would go over well

1136
01:02:02,486 --> 01:02:06,523
with your father's friends
and colleagues.

1138
01:02:09,960 --> 01:02:11,461
See you in class.

1139
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:17,434
Be a good boy.

1142
01:02:32,016 --> 01:02:33,383
What?

1143
01:02:33,417 --> 01:02:34,952
It was Sister Sophia's car.

1144
01:02:34,985 --> 01:02:36,821
What?

1145
01:02:36,854 --> 01:02:38,222
The car I saw
this morning, remember?

1146
01:02:38,255 --> 01:02:39,990
The car that was parked
down the street.

1147
01:02:40,024 --> 01:02:41,525
No, it wasn't,
just leave it alone.

1148
01:02:41,558 --> 01:02:43,093
I just checked
the license plate.

1149
01:02:43,127 --> 01:02:44,929
Are you trying
to protect her or something?

1150
01:02:44,962 --> 01:02:47,331
No, I'm not trying
to protect--

1151
01:02:47,364 --> 01:02:49,133
Just stop asking
stupid questions.

1152
01:02:49,166 --> 01:02:50,835
It wasn't her car, okay?

1153
01:02:50,868 --> 01:02:52,202
No, I'm not gonna stop.

1154
01:02:52,236 --> 01:02:54,271
I know when you're
hiding something.

1155
01:02:54,304 --> 01:02:58,042
Zoe, okay, okay, look,
you just gotta trust me.

1156
01:02:58,075 --> 01:03:00,044
It's not what you think.

1157
01:03:00,077 --> 01:03:01,245
I'm dealing with a situation,

1158
01:03:01,278 --> 01:03:02,813
and I just need
to figure it out.

1159
01:03:02,847 --> 01:03:04,481
Just don't tell
anybody about this,

1160
01:03:04,514 --> 01:03:07,918
especially not
Mom and Dad, okay?

1161
01:03:07,952 --> 01:03:13,257
Zoe, if you love me, you will
keep your mouth shut, okay?

1162
01:03:13,290 --> 01:03:14,124
Okay.

1163
01:03:14,158 --> 01:03:15,159
Good.

1164
01:03:15,192 --> 01:03:16,326
I'll see you later.
 
1168
01:03:27,137 --> 01:03:28,205
Good morning, class.

1169
01:03:28,238 --> 01:03:30,174
Good morning.

1170
01:03:30,207 --> 01:03:32,109
Who would like to start
the Morning Prayer?

1171
01:03:36,180 --> 01:03:40,184
Jason, why don't you lead us?

1172
01:03:46,323 --> 01:03:48,959
Give me, O Lord, I pray Thee...

1173
01:03:48,993 --> 01:03:52,629
Firm faith, unwavering hope,
perfect charity.

1174
01:03:52,662 --> 01:03:56,466
Pour into my heart the spirit
of wisdom and understanding,

1175
01:03:56,500 --> 01:03:59,436
the spirit of counsel
and spiritual strength,

1176
01:03:59,469 --> 01:04:02,873
the spirit of knowledge
and true godliness.

1177
01:04:02,907 --> 01:04:05,009
Beautifully recited
this morning.

1178
01:04:05,042 --> 01:04:06,576
Sister Rebecca.

1179
01:04:06,610 --> 01:04:08,345
What do we owe the visit?

1180
01:04:08,378 --> 01:04:11,315
Sara will be
rejoining the class.

1183
01:04:25,429 --> 01:04:29,466
Sister, how could
she be allowed back?

1184
01:04:29,499 --> 01:04:32,236
The decision of expulsion
is up to the board.

1185
01:04:32,269 --> 01:04:33,637
And in this case they felt
she had never been

1186
01:04:33,670 --> 01:04:35,339
in any serious trouble before.

1187
01:04:35,372 --> 01:04:37,574
That is ridiculous.

1188
01:04:37,607 --> 01:04:39,176
I thought you taught
values here.

1189
01:04:39,209 --> 01:04:41,411
We do,
but Sara's parents

1190
01:04:41,445 --> 01:04:43,580
happen to be generous donors
to the school.

1191
01:04:43,613 --> 01:04:45,449
The board will not
ignore that fact.

1192
01:04:45,482 --> 01:04:47,384
And Sister Sophia,

1193
01:04:47,417 --> 01:04:50,320
if we expect our students
to recite prayer,

1194
01:04:50,354 --> 01:04:52,122
then we should, too.

1197
01:04:56,426 --> 01:04:59,163
So, where'd you run off
to Saturday night?

1198
01:04:59,196 --> 01:05:02,166
We were just starting
to have some fun.

1199
01:05:02,199 --> 01:05:06,703
Jason, please stay.

1200
01:05:06,736 --> 01:05:08,238
Later.

1201
01:05:21,285 --> 01:05:24,221
It is impossible
to run away from this,

1202
01:05:24,254 --> 01:05:25,956
from us.

1204
01:05:30,460 --> 01:05:32,629
I don't want you talking
to that girl.

1205
01:05:32,662 --> 01:05:34,331
You can't tell me what to do.

1206
01:05:34,364 --> 01:05:35,432
Sara's my friend.

1207
01:05:35,465 --> 01:05:38,002
Your friend?

1208
01:05:38,035 --> 01:05:39,003
What kind of friend?

1209
01:05:39,036 --> 01:05:40,104
None of your business.

1210
01:05:40,137 --> 01:05:42,739
It is my business.

1211
01:05:42,772 --> 01:05:45,175
You are my business.

1212
01:05:45,209 --> 01:05:47,011
I'm not anymore.

1214
01:05:53,317 --> 01:05:54,451
Bye.

1215
01:05:54,484 --> 01:05:55,352
Hey.

1216
01:05:58,022 --> 01:06:00,324
Hey, I'm sorry
about the other night.

1217
01:06:00,357 --> 01:06:02,626
I was just nervous.

1218
01:06:02,659 --> 01:06:06,363
Can we maybe try again sometime?

1219
01:06:06,396 --> 01:06:08,232
Sure.

1220
01:06:08,265 --> 01:06:11,501
We'll just have to find a way
to get you to relax.

1221
01:06:11,535 --> 01:06:14,604
I know, why don't you play
your guitar for me later?

1222
01:06:14,638 --> 01:06:16,573
Okay.

1223
01:06:16,606 --> 01:06:17,741
I'll meet you
in the common room.

1225
01:06:24,581 --> 01:06:28,018
-I know.
-Told you!

1226
01:06:28,052 --> 01:06:31,221
* Traveled miles,
followed heart *

1227
01:06:31,255 --> 01:06:34,224
* Lost my way,
found my start *

1228
01:06:34,258 --> 01:06:37,494
* Given up,
knowing now *

1229
01:06:37,527 --> 01:06:40,130
* My whole family
doesn't get me now *

1231
01:06:42,232 --> 01:06:48,738
* All I am is a fire

1232
01:06:48,772 --> 01:06:55,579
* I am here to inspire

1233
01:06:55,612 --> 01:07:01,285
* All I am is a fire

1238
01:07:13,263 --> 01:07:15,365
* What is faith?

1242
01:07:24,108 --> 01:07:28,512
* Ohhh

1248
01:07:58,342 --> 01:07:59,509
What the hell?

1251
01:08:12,522 --> 01:08:16,426
Soap can be so slippery.

1255
01:08:44,454 --> 01:08:45,689
Oh, my God!

1256
01:08:45,722 --> 01:08:47,324
Help, help, someone help!

1257
01:08:55,799 --> 01:08:57,334
Sister Rebecca said
she just slipped

1258
01:08:57,367 --> 01:08:59,269
and hit her head
on the tile.

1259
01:08:59,303 --> 01:09:00,670
I mean, I've showered
hundreds of times in there.

1260
01:09:00,704 --> 01:09:03,540
I just--I can't believe it.

1261
01:09:03,573 --> 01:09:04,808
Neither can I.

1267
01:09:40,410 --> 01:09:46,316
Jason, have you said
your prayers for Sara?

1268
01:09:46,350 --> 01:09:49,319
Please tell me that you
had nothing to do with this.

1269
01:09:49,353 --> 01:09:51,888
The police said
it was an accident.

1270
01:09:51,921 --> 01:09:54,691
And before you go around
making horrible accusations,

1271
01:09:54,724 --> 01:09:57,594
I suggest you take
a hard look in the mirror.

1272
01:09:57,627 --> 01:09:58,795
You're the one
who's been committing

1273
01:09:58,828 --> 01:10:00,497
all the mortal sins around here.

1274
01:10:00,530 --> 01:10:01,698
Me?

1275
01:10:01,731 --> 01:10:04,634
What about you?

1276
01:10:04,668 --> 01:10:06,703
Let me show you something.

1278
01:10:10,774 --> 01:10:13,243
Looks like you're
enjoying yourself.

1279
01:10:13,277 --> 01:10:14,878
Whoa, whoa, you recorded us?

1280
01:10:14,911 --> 01:10:17,013
I like watching you,
what can I say--here, listen.

1281
01:10:17,046 --> 01:10:19,316
No, no, no,
you have to erase that.

1282
01:10:19,349 --> 01:10:21,918
Maybe I'll put it online,
or maybe I won't,

1283
01:10:21,951 --> 01:10:24,354
if you act nice.

1285
01:10:26,590 --> 01:10:28,792
It would ruin you, too.

1286
01:10:28,825 --> 01:10:31,895
I'm already ruined,

1287
01:10:31,928 --> 01:10:35,031
and I don't care.

1288
01:10:35,064 --> 01:10:38,368
Jason, I don't want to quarrel.

1289
01:10:38,402 --> 01:10:40,670
I just want to get out of here,

1290
01:10:40,704 --> 01:10:43,507
and I want you to come with me.

1291
01:10:43,540 --> 01:10:45,475
Please.

1292
01:10:45,509 --> 01:10:47,977
I can't wait much longer.

1294
01:10:55,785 --> 01:10:57,621
It's just crazy, I mean,
I was talking to her,

1295
01:10:57,654 --> 01:11:01,024
like, an hour before, and then
I just find her in the shower.

1296
01:11:01,057 --> 01:11:02,892
Come on, come on.

1297
01:11:02,926 --> 01:11:03,793
You've been through a lot.

1298
01:11:03,827 --> 01:11:04,794
Let's get you guys home.

1302
01:11:33,557 --> 01:11:35,525
This has been a week
of great sorrow.

1303
01:11:35,559 --> 01:11:37,694
Yes, it has.

1304
01:11:37,727 --> 01:11:39,629
Even more so for me.

1305
01:11:39,663 --> 01:11:42,332
What do you mean?

1306
01:11:42,366 --> 01:11:45,369
My Aunt Francis
passed away this morning.

1308
01:11:49,138 --> 01:11:50,840
Lord, have mercy.

1309
01:11:50,874 --> 01:11:53,710
I am so sorry.

1310
01:11:53,743 --> 01:11:55,745
I'd like to go
to her funeral,

1311
01:11:55,779 --> 01:11:57,347
if that's okay with you.

1312
01:11:57,381 --> 01:11:58,882
Of course.

1313
01:11:58,915 --> 01:11:59,983
You have my blessing.

1314
01:12:00,016 --> 01:12:01,818
Thank you, Sister.

1317
01:12:10,059 --> 01:12:11,595
So this is nice, huh?

1318
01:12:11,628 --> 01:12:12,996
Mr. Brady,

1319
01:12:13,029 --> 01:12:14,598
what a pleasure to have you
and your family

1320
01:12:14,631 --> 01:12:16,099
dining with us this evening.

1321
01:12:16,132 --> 01:12:17,867
Let me bring you out
something special

1322
01:12:17,901 --> 01:12:18,802
to get you started with.

1323
01:12:18,835 --> 01:12:19,769
Thank you, Morgan.

1324
01:12:22,005 --> 01:12:24,774
So, how are you two holding up?

1325
01:12:24,808 --> 01:12:27,143
Okay, I guess.

1326
01:12:27,176 --> 01:12:28,612
I can't imagine how
that poor girl's family

1327
01:12:28,645 --> 01:12:31,781
is doing right now.

1328
01:12:31,815 --> 01:12:33,617
Evening--may I help you?

1329
01:12:33,650 --> 01:12:34,784
Table for one.

1330
01:12:34,818 --> 01:12:35,619
Certainly.

1331
01:12:35,652 --> 01:12:38,488
Right this way.

1332
01:12:38,522 --> 01:12:41,090
How about you, son,
you all right?

1333
01:12:41,124 --> 01:12:42,859
Hello, Jason?

1334
01:12:42,892 --> 01:12:44,060
Yeah?

1335
01:12:44,093 --> 01:12:46,730
Yeah, I'm okay, I guess.

1337
01:12:49,766 --> 01:12:52,001
I do not believe this.

1338
01:12:52,035 --> 01:12:55,071
What, sweetheart?

1339
01:12:55,104 --> 01:12:58,041
I don't wanna bother you all,
but I'm Sister Sophia.

1340
01:12:58,074 --> 01:13:00,176
I'm Zoe and Jason's
homeroom teacher.

1341
01:13:00,209 --> 01:13:01,778
Oh, of course.

1342
01:13:01,811 --> 01:13:03,680
What a pleasure to meet you.

1343
01:13:03,713 --> 01:13:05,415
It's a pleasure
to meet you as well.

1344
01:13:05,449 --> 01:13:07,116
Oh, Mr. Brady,
you have quite the reputation

1345
01:13:07,150 --> 01:13:08,885
as a chiropractor.

1346
01:13:08,918 --> 01:13:10,754
You've done your homework.

1347
01:13:10,787 --> 01:13:12,989
You must be quite pleased with
your new position at the school.

1348
01:13:13,022 --> 01:13:14,924
I am pleased.

1349
01:13:14,958 --> 01:13:17,494
Although this week has proven
to be quite challenging.

1350
01:13:17,527 --> 01:13:18,862
Oh, of course.

1351
01:13:18,895 --> 01:13:20,830
It's just horrible
what happened.

1352
01:13:20,864 --> 01:13:23,500
Indeed.

1353
01:13:23,533 --> 01:13:25,034
Well, I should get
back to my table.

1354
01:13:25,068 --> 01:13:26,836
It was good seeing you.

1355
01:13:26,870 --> 01:13:28,838
I hope that you two find
some comfort this weekend.

1356
01:13:28,872 --> 01:13:32,041
Pardon me, are you dining alone
this evening?

1357
01:13:32,075 --> 01:13:34,110
Well, yes.

1358
01:13:34,143 --> 01:13:36,780
I just came
from my aunt's funeral.

1359
01:13:36,813 --> 01:13:38,815
She passed away
earlier this week.

1360
01:13:38,848 --> 01:13:41,117
Oh, Sister,
we're so sorry to hear that.

1361
01:13:41,150 --> 01:13:42,919
Well, we can't
let you dine alone.

1362
01:13:42,952 --> 01:13:44,854
Please, you should join us.

1363
01:13:44,888 --> 01:13:45,755
I don't think
that's a good idea.

1364
01:13:45,789 --> 01:13:47,190
Jason.

1365
01:13:47,223 --> 01:13:49,092
No, it's, it's a family dinner.

1366
01:13:49,125 --> 01:13:50,226
You understand.

1367
01:13:50,259 --> 01:13:51,661
Its, it's a family thing.

1368
01:13:51,695 --> 01:13:53,663
Son, don't be rude.

1369
01:13:53,697 --> 01:13:57,166
I don't wanna intrude
on family dinner.

1370
01:13:57,200 --> 01:14:00,637
Please, we will not
take no for an answer.

1371
01:14:00,670 --> 01:14:03,072
In that case, thank you.

1372
01:14:03,106 --> 01:14:05,475
Morgan, can we get another
setting here, please?

1373
01:14:05,509 --> 01:14:07,143
Oh, of course.

1375
01:14:08,612 --> 01:14:10,146
There you are.

1376
01:14:10,179 --> 01:14:11,748
That's very kind of you.

1377
01:14:11,781 --> 01:14:13,216
Of course.

1379
01:14:18,755 --> 01:14:21,591
In case someone calls me.

1380
01:14:21,625 --> 01:14:23,059
So where did you teach
before St. Adeline?

1381
01:14:23,092 --> 01:14:24,160
I was at a school in Missoula.

1382
01:14:24,193 --> 01:14:25,228
Montana?

1383
01:14:25,261 --> 01:14:26,062
Is that where you're from?

1384
01:14:26,095 --> 01:14:27,831
Born and raised.

1385
01:14:27,864 --> 01:14:30,233
I thought you were born
in Billings.

1386
01:14:30,266 --> 01:14:32,569
Well, yes, technically.

1387
01:14:32,602 --> 01:14:35,639
But Billings is
right next to Missoula, so--

1388
01:14:35,672 --> 01:14:37,674
So how do you like Los Angeles?

1389
01:14:37,707 --> 01:14:38,975
It's different.

1390
01:14:39,008 --> 01:14:40,043
Warmer.

1391
01:14:40,076 --> 01:14:41,578
That's for sure.

1392
01:14:41,611 --> 01:14:42,879
But I especially
like the people.

1393
01:14:42,912 --> 01:14:45,849
They're warmer, too.

1395
01:14:47,917 --> 01:14:51,120
Well, I suppose that depends
on where you go.

1396
01:14:51,154 --> 01:14:54,558
Missoula is not
next to Billings.

1397
01:14:54,591 --> 01:14:57,093
It's over 300 miles away.

1398
01:14:58,828 --> 01:15:01,598
In a state as big as Montana,

1399
01:15:01,631 --> 01:15:05,902
300 miles away
is right next door.

1401
01:15:11,207 --> 01:15:12,642
Can we talk
about something else?

1402
01:15:12,676 --> 01:15:13,810
Here we are.

1403
01:15:13,843 --> 01:15:15,278
-Oh, look at this.
-Enjoy.

1404
01:15:15,311 --> 01:15:16,613
Oh, wow, that looks fantastic.

1405
01:15:16,646 --> 01:15:17,647
Thank you, Morgan.

1406
01:15:17,681 --> 01:15:18,281
My pleasure.

1407
01:15:20,617 --> 01:15:21,718
But, you must have had
a lady there

1408
01:15:21,751 --> 01:15:22,786
by the name of Francis.

1409
01:15:22,819 --> 01:15:24,153
Please check again.

1410
01:15:24,187 --> 01:15:25,722
I just want
the funeral information

1411
01:15:25,755 --> 01:15:28,057
so I can send flowers.

1412
01:15:28,091 --> 01:15:30,994
I'm sorry, we don't have
anyone here by that name.

1413
01:15:31,027 --> 01:15:34,263
But her niece, Sister Sophia,
has been visiting every weekend.

1414
01:15:34,297 --> 01:15:36,766
Surely you must know her.

1415
01:15:36,800 --> 01:15:39,836
There hasn't been any visitor
by that name either.

1416
01:15:39,869 --> 01:15:43,006
Okay, thank you.

1419
01:15:50,346 --> 01:15:51,748
Oh my God, Jason.

1420
01:15:51,781 --> 01:15:54,851
What's going on?

1421
01:15:54,884 --> 01:15:56,720
You have to swear
that you will not say this

1422
01:15:56,753 --> 01:15:57,954
to anybody.

1423
01:15:57,987 --> 01:15:59,989
I swear.

1424
01:16:00,023 --> 01:16:03,627
She, um...

1425
01:16:03,660 --> 01:16:05,061
she was flirting with me, right?

1426
01:16:05,094 --> 01:16:08,898
And oh, God, I was an idiot.

1427
01:16:08,932 --> 01:16:10,166
I let it happen.

1428
01:16:10,199 --> 01:16:11,901
You let what happen?

1430
01:16:19,008 --> 01:16:21,110
I slept with her, Zoe.

1431
01:16:21,144 --> 01:16:22,111
I didn't plan it.

1432
01:16:22,145 --> 01:16:23,713
It just happened.

1433
01:16:23,747 --> 01:16:26,082
And now it's gotten
way out of hand.

1434
01:16:26,115 --> 01:16:27,651
She won't leave me alone.

1435
01:16:27,684 --> 01:16:29,218
She wants me to, like,
run away with her

1436
01:16:29,252 --> 01:16:31,054
to Paris or something.

1437
01:16:31,087 --> 01:16:33,189
God, Jason, you have
to tell someone about this.

1438
01:16:33,222 --> 01:16:36,192
No, do you know
what this would do to Mom?

1439
01:16:36,225 --> 01:16:38,161
I slept with a nun.

1440
01:16:38,194 --> 01:16:39,863
And Dad, are you kidding me?

1441
01:16:39,896 --> 01:16:41,765
He'd never forgive me.

1443
01:16:45,902 --> 01:16:48,738
Plus, um,

1444
01:16:48,772 --> 01:16:51,207
she's got a video of us.

1445
01:16:51,240 --> 01:16:55,078
She's threatening to post it
online if I say anything.

1446
01:16:55,111 --> 01:16:57,046
You can't let her
get away with this.

1447
01:16:57,080 --> 01:16:58,147
You're the victim here.

1448
01:16:58,181 --> 01:17:00,884
What do I do?

1449
01:17:00,917 --> 01:17:02,786
I don't even think
she's a real nun.

1450
01:17:02,819 --> 01:17:04,821
I mean, what kind of nun
acts like this?

1451
01:17:04,854 --> 01:17:07,056
I don't even think
she's Sister Sophia.

1452
01:17:07,090 --> 01:17:08,825
What do you mean?

1453
01:17:08,858 --> 01:17:10,894
She doesn't know
where she was born,

1454
01:17:10,927 --> 01:17:12,996
she doesn't know how far
Billings is from Missoula.

1455
01:17:13,029 --> 01:17:16,232
Those are things that
the real Sophia would know.

1456
01:17:16,265 --> 01:17:18,301
So who is she?

1457
01:17:18,334 --> 01:17:21,705
I don't know.

1458
01:17:21,738 --> 01:17:24,207
Maybe we just...
take it to the police.

1459
01:17:24,240 --> 01:17:26,676
With what? A hunch?

1460
01:17:26,710 --> 01:17:28,845
She's a freak
who can't read maps?

1461
01:17:28,878 --> 01:17:30,880
Come on.

1462
01:17:30,914 --> 01:17:33,149
We're gonna need
more proof than that.

1464
01:17:35,384 --> 01:17:39,222
There's a laptop in her room.

1465
01:17:39,255 --> 01:17:41,825
Maybe if we could get into it,
we can find the proof we need.

1466
01:17:41,858 --> 01:17:43,226
And then what?

1467
01:17:43,259 --> 01:17:44,861
Turn the tables on her.

1470
01:17:55,905 --> 01:17:57,440
Sister.

1471
01:17:57,473 --> 01:17:58,942
You startled me.

1472
01:17:58,975 --> 01:18:01,978
A word, in my office.

1477
01:18:47,857 --> 01:18:50,193
Why are you lying?

1478
01:18:50,226 --> 01:18:52,962
What on Earth do you mean?

1479
01:18:52,996 --> 01:18:55,264
Since the day you arrived

1480
01:18:55,298 --> 01:18:58,334
there was something about you
I couldn't put my finger on.

1481
01:18:58,367 --> 01:19:00,904
And even one of my best students
voiced her concerns.

1482
01:19:00,937 --> 01:19:04,908
Of course I dismissed them.

1483
01:19:04,941 --> 01:19:10,847
Then, I found out
you were lying about your aunt.

1484
01:19:10,880 --> 01:19:12,849
I called the hospital.

1485
01:19:12,882 --> 01:19:16,552
There is no Aunt Francis.

1488
01:19:33,602 --> 01:19:40,076
My Aunt Francis
went by her first name, Mary.

1489
01:19:40,109 --> 01:19:42,846
That's why they don't
have a record of it.

1490
01:19:42,879 --> 01:19:44,881
Then why didn't they have
any record of you?

1491
01:19:44,914 --> 01:19:47,016
I mean, surely they would have
remembered a nun

1492
01:19:47,050 --> 01:19:49,552
coming there
every weekend to visit.

1494
01:19:52,388 --> 01:19:55,825
So, now you've lied to me again.

1495
01:19:55,859 --> 01:19:58,327
I wonder, Sister Sophia,

1496
01:19:58,361 --> 01:20:01,530
what else are you lying about?

1498
01:20:05,902 --> 01:20:07,403
It's really weird,

1499
01:20:07,436 --> 01:20:10,006
there are no pictures
of Sister Sophia on here,

1500
01:20:10,039 --> 01:20:12,275
but there are tons of photos
of this other nun.

1501
01:20:12,308 --> 01:20:13,843
Check this out.

1502
01:20:13,877 --> 01:20:15,444
She's has another laptop.

1504
01:20:18,147 --> 01:20:21,084
I'm not sure where you're
getting your information from,

1505
01:20:21,117 --> 01:20:22,952
but I'm not lying.

1507
01:20:25,254 --> 01:20:26,222
What are you doing?

1508
01:20:26,255 --> 01:20:27,623
Calling St. Val's.

1509
01:20:27,656 --> 01:20:29,158
I'm sure they can clear this
all up.

1510
01:20:29,192 --> 01:20:30,626
This is ridiculous.

1511
01:20:30,659 --> 01:20:31,995
What is St. Val's gonna tell you
that I can't?

1512
01:20:32,028 --> 01:20:33,997
Oh, I'm sure
quite a bit.

1513
01:20:34,030 --> 01:20:36,332
In fact, I'm sure the dean would
love to have a chat with you.


1515
01:20:37,901 --> 01:20:39,468
What's this?

1517
01:20:43,672 --> 01:20:47,010
Oh, my God.

1518
01:20:47,043 --> 01:20:49,478
She has hundreds
of pictures of you.

1520
01:20:53,983 --> 01:20:54,984
Give me the phone.

1521
01:20:55,018 --> 01:20:57,086
Give me that phone!

1522
01:20:57,120 --> 01:21:00,356
I am going to get the Father.

1523
01:21:00,389 --> 01:21:02,258
Sister Rebecca,
I'll tell you the truth.

1525
01:21:09,098 --> 01:21:10,233
Laura Patterson?

1526
01:21:10,266 --> 01:21:11,901
Is that her real name?

1527
01:21:11,935 --> 01:21:13,569
She's not a nun.

1528
01:21:13,602 --> 01:21:16,039
You were right, she's been
pretending the whole time.

1529
01:21:16,072 --> 01:21:18,141
We gotta show this
to Sister Rebecca now.

1531
01:21:30,954 --> 01:21:33,689
Sister Rebecca?

1532
01:21:33,722 --> 01:21:35,624
Sister Rebecca.

1533
01:21:35,658 --> 01:21:36,993
Hey, it's Sunday.

1534
01:21:37,026 --> 01:21:38,461
Let's check the chapel.

1536
01:21:42,231 --> 01:21:43,232
Hello?

1537
01:21:43,266 --> 01:21:44,600
Sister Rebecca?

1540
01:21:57,613 --> 01:21:59,048
What are you doing?

1542
01:22:06,055 --> 01:22:07,323
Where's Sister Rebecca?

1543
01:22:07,356 --> 01:22:09,558
I don't know.

1544
01:22:09,592 --> 01:22:12,428
But she did say that you've been
telling lies about me, Zoe.

1545
01:22:12,461 --> 01:22:14,063
I'm lying?

1546
01:22:14,097 --> 01:22:15,431
That's hilarious
coming from someone

1547
01:22:15,464 --> 01:22:17,466
who isn't even
who she says she is.

1548
01:22:17,500 --> 01:22:19,102
You recognize this?

1549
01:22:19,135 --> 01:22:20,603
I believe your name is Laura?

1550
01:22:20,636 --> 01:22:23,206
Laura Patterson.

1551
01:22:23,239 --> 01:22:25,274
You're not even
a real nun, are you?

1552
01:22:26,509 --> 01:22:27,610
I knew it.

1553
01:22:27,643 --> 01:22:29,612
Come on.

1554
01:22:29,645 --> 01:22:31,314
No, it was you, Jason.

1555
01:22:31,347 --> 01:22:33,149
You led me here.

1556
01:22:33,182 --> 01:22:35,184
You wrote those songs for me.

1557
01:22:35,218 --> 01:22:36,485
I didn't write
those songs for you.

1558
01:22:36,519 --> 01:22:38,554
I don't even know you.

1559
01:22:38,587 --> 01:22:41,557
You know me better than anyone.

1560
01:22:41,590 --> 01:22:43,226
Come on, it's time for us to go.

1561
01:22:43,259 --> 01:22:45,694
I'm not going
anywhere with you, ever.

1562
01:22:45,728 --> 01:22:47,330
You're really sick,
you know that?

1563
01:22:47,363 --> 01:22:48,464
Just leave my brother alone.

1564
01:22:48,497 --> 01:22:50,166
Don't listen to her.

1565
01:22:50,199 --> 01:22:51,500
She's trying to keep us apart.

1566
01:22:51,534 --> 01:22:53,336
There is no us,

1567
01:22:53,369 --> 01:22:55,704
Sophia, Laura,
whoever the hell you are.

1568
01:22:55,738 --> 01:22:58,241
You're just--you're just
some crazy stalker

1569
01:22:58,274 --> 01:23:00,209
who deserves to be locked up.

1570
01:23:00,243 --> 01:23:01,477
No.

1572
01:23:05,148 --> 01:23:06,415
Zoe!

1573
01:23:06,449 --> 01:23:07,650
Now we can be together.

1576
01:23:13,422 --> 01:23:16,625
I am sick and tired of people
trying to keep us apart.

1577
01:23:16,659 --> 01:23:20,229
First that slut Sara,
and now your sister.

1578
01:23:20,263 --> 01:23:22,165
Well, I'm done.

1579
01:23:22,198 --> 01:23:23,799
This is for us, Jason.

1581
01:23:26,335 --> 01:23:27,803
Get out of here!

1587
01:24:00,736 --> 01:24:03,306
Jason?

1590
01:24:13,482 --> 01:24:15,484
Zoe.

1595
01:24:39,708 --> 01:24:41,210
Well, Sister,

1596
01:24:41,244 --> 01:24:43,312
if there ever was a year
to test our faith,

1597
01:24:43,346 --> 01:24:44,747
this was it.

1598
01:24:44,780 --> 01:24:47,116
It most definitely was.

1599
01:24:47,150 --> 01:24:48,217
I just thank God

1600
01:24:48,251 --> 01:24:49,752
He was looking out
for all of us.

1601
01:24:51,920 --> 01:24:54,123
Why don't we all
take a little road trip

1602
01:24:54,157 --> 01:24:55,224
out to Whittendale this weekend?

1603
01:24:55,258 --> 01:24:56,492
Really?

1604
01:24:56,525 --> 01:24:57,726
Yeah, check out your residence,

1605
01:24:57,760 --> 01:24:58,861
Zoe, see what you might need.

1606
01:24:58,894 --> 01:25:00,363
Yeah, that sounds great.

1607
01:25:00,396 --> 01:25:01,797
Why don't you drive,

1608
01:25:01,830 --> 01:25:06,869
seeing as your mom's car
is now yours.

1609
01:25:06,902 --> 01:25:08,471
For real?

1610
01:25:08,504 --> 01:25:11,240
Happy graduation,
honey.

1611
01:25:11,274 --> 01:25:14,143
Just be careful.

1612
01:25:14,177 --> 01:25:17,313
Got something
for you, too, Jason.

1614
01:25:19,648 --> 01:25:22,151
No way.

1616
01:25:24,420 --> 01:25:26,589
Well, if you're
gonna be the best,

1617
01:25:26,622 --> 01:25:28,891
you got to play
on the best.

1618
01:25:28,924 --> 01:25:31,794
Thanks, Dad.

1619
01:25:31,827 --> 01:25:34,230
I'm proud of you--
always will be.

1620
01:25:34,263 --> 01:25:36,865
Thank you,
thank you, thank you.

1621
01:25:36,899 --> 01:25:40,803
Well, how does it sound?
