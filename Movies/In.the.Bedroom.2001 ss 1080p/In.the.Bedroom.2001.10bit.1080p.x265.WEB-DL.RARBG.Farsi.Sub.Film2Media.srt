( laughing continues )

5
00:01:38,266 --> 00:01:41,202
I love it here.

6
00:01:41,235 --> 00:01:42,503
I know you do.

7
00:01:47,508 --> 00:01:50,878
I can feel my life, you know?

00:02:26,514 --> 00:02:27,891
Sportscaster on radio:
Pitch to Hatteberg.

9
00:02:27,915 --> 00:02:30,684
Strike ball over the
outside corner, at the knees.

10
00:02:30,718 --> 00:02:32,686
Appeared a little upset
with the call

11
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:35,823
by the home-plate umpire,
didn't appear to say anything.

12
00:02:35,856 --> 00:02:37,858

( Sportscast stops )

14
00:03:04,852 --> 00:03:07,688
- Hey.
- Woman: Hey.

15
00:03:07,721 --> 00:03:09,623
Morning, Dr. Fowler.

16
00:03:09,657 --> 00:03:10,967
Morning, Natalie.
How you doing, boys?

17
00:03:10,991 --> 00:03:12,993
Great!

18
00:03:13,026 --> 00:03:15,896
Hey, Duncan,
sure you don't want to go?

19
00:03:15,929 --> 00:03:18,266
- Want to get in here?
- No, he wants to stay here.

20
00:03:18,299 --> 00:03:20,301
Scootch up.
Get in the middle there.

21
00:03:21,969 --> 00:03:23,971
Come on. Bye, Dr. Fowler.

22
00:03:24,004 --> 00:03:25,373
- Bye.
- Bye!

23
00:03:25,406 --> 00:03:27,841
( laughing ) You don't
want to wave good-bye?

24
00:03:27,875 --> 00:03:29,943
You don't want to wave good-bye?

25
00:03:29,977 --> 00:03:34,282
( laughs ) Sweetie, what do
you want for breakfast?

26
00:03:34,315 --> 00:03:36,016
Cereal.

Announcer: You've been listening
to "Red Sox Replay."

29
00:03:41,054 --> 00:03:44,825
WQSS Camden's repeat broadcast
of Boston Red Sox baseball

30
00:03:44,858 --> 00:03:47,528
has been brought to you
by George C. Hall & Sons

31
00:03:47,561 --> 00:03:50,498
of Rockland in business
in mid-coast since 19...

32
00:03:56,404 --> 00:03:58,372
( foghorn blowing )

33
00:04:50,791 --> 00:04:53,561
( Back-up signal beeping )

34
00:05:17,918 --> 00:05:18,986
There you go.

35
00:05:30,531 --> 00:05:33,534
( Engine slowing )

36
00:06:07,735 --> 00:06:09,903
Oh, boy.

37
00:06:09,937 --> 00:06:12,673
You see what happened
to this poor fella?

38
00:06:12,706 --> 00:06:14,041
What?

39
00:06:14,074 --> 00:06:16,143
Well, look. He lost an arm.

40
00:06:16,176 --> 00:06:20,581
See, the trap has nylon nets,
called heads,

41
00:06:20,614 --> 00:06:25,152
two side side heads
to let the lobster crawl in

42
00:06:25,185 --> 00:06:27,921
and inside, what they call
a bedroom head

43
00:06:27,955 --> 00:06:30,691
to hold the bait
and keeps him from escaping.

44
00:06:30,724 --> 00:06:32,159
Now you know the old saying

45
00:06:32,192 --> 00:06:34,895
"two's company,
three's a crowd"?

46
00:06:34,928 --> 00:06:36,530
Well, it's like that.

47
00:06:36,564 --> 00:06:38,966
You, uh, get more than
two of these in a bedroom

48
00:06:38,999 --> 00:06:41,869
and chances are something
like that's going to happen.

49
00:06:41,902 --> 00:06:43,871
That's why Frank can't
leave these traps

50
00:06:43,904 --> 00:06:45,038
for more than a day.

51
00:06:45,072 --> 00:06:48,175
Dad, show him this one.

52
00:06:48,208 --> 00:06:50,944
Now

53
00:06:50,978 --> 00:06:53,881
the older females,
like this old gal

54
00:06:53,914 --> 00:06:55,949
they're the most dangerous,

55
00:06:55,983 --> 00:06:58,151
especially when they're
growing berries.

56
00:06:58,185 --> 00:06:59,152
Berries?

57
00:06:59,186 --> 00:07:00,788
Yeah, eggs. You see?

58
00:07:00,821 --> 00:07:03,957
She could take out
two males, no problem.

59
00:07:03,991 --> 00:07:06,760
That's when you get a lobster
you can't sell.

60
00:07:06,794 --> 00:07:09,663
But this fine lady,
she, uh, she has it easy

61
00:07:09,697 --> 00:07:13,033
'cause the state says
we have to let her go.

62
00:07:14,635 --> 00:07:16,003
( Water splashes )

63
00:07:18,539 --> 00:07:23,176
Okay, now, you think
you can handle this?

64
00:07:23,210 --> 00:07:24,712
- Mm-hmm.
- Are you sure?

65
00:07:24,745 --> 00:07:27,915
- Mm-hmm.
- Okay, go ahead.

66
00:07:27,948 --> 00:07:29,149
Put her in the tank.

67
00:07:30,150 --> 00:07:33,654
( Chuckles ) Good.

68
00:07:33,687 --> 00:07:36,890
- Higher. Higher!
- Higher!

69
00:07:36,924 --> 00:07:39,259
I'll swing you higher.
Like that?

70
00:07:39,292 --> 00:07:41,004
- That high enough?
- ( sportscaster talking indistinctly )

71
00:07:41,028 --> 00:07:42,162
Duncan: Yep.

72
00:07:47,034 --> 00:07:49,570
Aah, Ruth hates these.

73
00:07:49,603 --> 00:07:50,571
What?

74
00:07:50,604 --> 00:07:52,673
I got the wrong kind of buns.

75
00:07:52,706 --> 00:07:55,042
Maybe we can borrow hers.

76
00:07:55,075 --> 00:07:55,909
Two.

77
00:07:55,943 --> 00:07:58,912
You've had a lot, huh?
Here, sweetie.

78
00:07:58,946 --> 00:08:02,049
Ah, what I would give
to have back my youth.

79
00:08:02,082 --> 00:08:05,753
Yeah, well, Willis, you never
had that in your youth.

80
00:08:05,786 --> 00:08:07,788
You can go play.

81
00:08:12,593 --> 00:08:14,862
Hey, father, you made it.

82
00:08:14,895 --> 00:08:16,864
If I don't get to see
you fellas here,

83
00:08:16,897 --> 00:08:18,498
I don't get to see you at all.

84
00:08:22,002 --> 00:08:23,003
Hey.

85
00:08:23,036 --> 00:08:24,304
Hey.

86
00:08:24,337 --> 00:08:25,706
You want a beer?

87
00:08:25,739 --> 00:08:27,808
No, I'm going to go see

88
00:08:27,841 --> 00:08:29,710
if your mom needs
any help, okay?

89
00:08:29,743 --> 00:08:31,178
- All right, good luck.
- Yeah.

90
00:08:49,997 --> 00:08:51,999
( Knife chopping )

91
00:08:56,136 --> 00:08:57,571
Excuse me.

92
00:08:57,605 --> 00:08:59,306
Can I help you with
anything here?

93
00:08:59,339 --> 00:09:02,042
Oh, yes, you can
hand me that bowl, dear.

94
00:09:02,075 --> 00:09:03,210
Great.

95
00:09:03,243 --> 00:09:06,013
- Uh, this one here?
- ( water running in sink )

96
00:09:06,046 --> 00:09:07,981
Yes. Thank you.

97
00:09:11,885 --> 00:09:15,355
I'm looking forward
to that concert on Labor Day.

98
00:09:15,388 --> 00:09:18,826
The music's so unusual.

99
00:09:18,859 --> 00:09:21,161
It's haunting, really.

100
00:09:21,194 --> 00:09:23,030
It is, isn't it?

101
00:09:23,063 --> 00:09:24,297
Mmm.

102
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:31,805
How did you learn about
that, uh, style?

103
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:34,074
- At Brown.
- Ah.

104
00:09:34,107 --> 00:09:36,143
I did my thesis
on Eastern European folk music.

105
00:09:36,176 --> 00:09:38,278
Oh, I thought about
becoming a teacher.

106
00:09:38,311 --> 00:09:39,947
Oh, why didn't you?

107
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:41,982
Mommy!

108
00:09:42,015 --> 00:09:43,951
Yeah? What are you eating?

109
00:09:43,984 --> 00:09:45,686
Nothing.

110
00:09:45,719 --> 00:09:46,987
Is it good?

111
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:47,988
Yeah.

112
00:09:48,021 --> 00:09:49,990
Swing me. Swing me.

113
00:09:50,023 --> 00:09:54,094
Okay, I'll swing you, Dunc.
I'll be right back.

114
00:09:54,127 --> 00:09:56,329
So, Mr. Strout mentioned
you again.

115
00:09:56,363 --> 00:09:57,330
I'll bet he did.

116
00:09:57,364 --> 00:09:58,799
He still talks about you.

117
00:09:58,832 --> 00:10:00,276
Says you're the best can-packer
he ever had.

118
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:01,802
Yeah?

119
00:10:01,835 --> 00:10:03,637
Says you looked real cute in
that hair net.

120
00:10:03,671 --> 00:10:06,006
Excuse me, boys. An offering.
Here, father.

121
00:10:06,039 --> 00:10:07,107
Thank you.

122
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:10,043
So that's what
Charles Sr.'s doing

123
00:10:10,077 --> 00:10:12,212
and, uh, Becky went
to the hairdressing academy

124
00:10:12,245 --> 00:10:14,081
after high school.

125
00:10:14,114 --> 00:10:16,083
Of course, after she got married

126
00:10:16,116 --> 00:10:20,821
she decided she wanted to stay
home with the boys, you know.

127
00:10:20,854 --> 00:10:24,224
She still loves doing hair,
though.

128
00:10:24,257 --> 00:10:26,026
Where do you go, father?

129
00:10:26,059 --> 00:10:27,995
I just go to Super cuts.

130
00:10:28,028 --> 00:10:29,663
Wha?

131
00:10:29,697 --> 00:10:32,733
You can't request
the same girl at Super cuts.

132
00:10:32,766 --> 00:10:35,703
Man: I tell you, those boys
are having a great time.

133
00:10:35,736 --> 00:10:37,738
It was good of you
to do this for them.

134
00:10:37,771 --> 00:10:39,807
Well, she hasn't
brought them before

135
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:41,074
because she's embarrassed.

136
00:10:41,108 --> 00:10:42,910
She shouldn't be embarrassed.

137
00:10:42,943 --> 00:10:45,045
I wish you hadn't put up
that monstrosity.

138
00:10:45,078 --> 00:10:48,381
We're just going to have to
take it apart when they leave.

139
00:10:48,415 --> 00:10:50,751
- What, the swing?
- The swing.

140
00:10:50,784 --> 00:10:53,453
Oh, Ruth, he's a kid.
What do you expect?

141
00:10:53,486 --> 00:10:55,723
"Happy birthday. Here's a box.

142
00:10:55,756 --> 00:10:57,725
Drag it around for a while."

143
00:10:57,758 --> 00:11:00,260
He's a kid.
He's like me, he wants it now.

144
00:11:02,429 --> 00:11:04,031

00:12:50,170 --> 00:12:51,204
Oh.

181
00:12:53,373 --> 00:12:56,043
Ruth: She's not
divorced yet, you know.

182
00:12:56,076 --> 00:12:57,544
Matt: It's the same thing.

183
00:12:57,577 --> 00:13:00,013
Maine has crazy laws,
that's all.

184
00:13:00,047 --> 00:13:02,249
Anyway, he loves her boys.

185
00:13:04,251 --> 00:13:05,853
Oh, God, you don't think
he wants to...

186
00:13:05,886 --> 00:13:07,855
No, he's not going to marry her.

187
00:13:07,888 --> 00:13:10,190
Well, then what's he
doing with her?

188
00:13:10,223 --> 00:13:12,059
She probably loves him.

189
00:13:12,092 --> 00:13:15,028
Girls always have.
Let's just leave it at that.

190
00:13:15,062 --> 00:13:17,998
( Sighs )

191
00:13:18,031 --> 00:13:19,933
Well, he won't listen to me.

192
00:13:19,967 --> 00:13:23,370
I've asked him three times
to dismantle that swing set.

193
00:13:23,403 --> 00:13:24,571
Oh, leave it up.

194
00:13:24,604 --> 00:13:27,074
Looks like a young
couple lives here.

195
00:13:27,107 --> 00:13:30,010
( laughs )

196
00:13:30,043 --> 00:13:33,914
Well, he needs his head
in school not in her.

197
00:13:33,947 --> 00:13:36,349
So to speak.

198
00:13:36,383 --> 00:13:39,319
- ( Shocked gasp )
- Ow.

199
00:13:39,352 --> 00:13:43,323
It would help if you
were on my side.

200
00:13:43,356 --> 00:13:46,026
Oh, I can be on your side.

201
00:13:46,059 --> 00:13:47,427
( Chuckling )

202
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:51,398
- I've got a needle.
- Here I come, ready or not.

203
00:13:51,431 --> 00:13:53,151
- I've got a needle.
- You don't need those.

204
00:14:04,444 --> 00:14:06,179
( Tone beeps )

205
00:14:06,213 --> 00:14:09,249
Mr. And Mrs. Adams on?

206
00:14:09,282 --> 00:14:12,585
Okay, you can put your shirt
back on now.

207
00:14:12,619 --> 00:14:17,290
Yesterday, he was up
and around all afternoon,

208
00:14:17,324 --> 00:14:19,659
but today he tumbled.

209
00:14:19,692 --> 00:14:21,328
He's fallen twice.

210
00:14:21,361 --> 00:14:24,497
I have all I can do
to get him up.

211
00:14:24,531 --> 00:14:26,499
He's weak.

212
00:14:26,533 --> 00:14:28,601
Said when he couldn't
work no more,

213
00:14:28,635 --> 00:14:29,669
he didn't want to live.

214
00:14:29,702 --> 00:14:33,040
For a while, he sat
and just mended our nets

215
00:14:33,073 --> 00:14:35,042
but he can't do that no more.

216
00:14:35,075 --> 00:14:36,376
How's your dad, Matt?

217
00:14:36,409 --> 00:14:38,111
Oh, I'm sorry, doctor.

218
00:14:38,145 --> 00:14:39,512
Now, Elwyn, you remember,

219
00:14:39,546 --> 00:14:43,016
Jesse Fowler passed away
a while ago.

220
00:14:43,050 --> 00:14:45,252
We were at his funeral,
remember?

221
00:14:45,285 --> 00:14:46,954
( Fax machine dialing )

222
00:14:46,987 --> 00:14:49,089
Back in an hour, Janelle.

223
00:14:49,122 --> 00:14:50,423
Uh, forgot my lunch.

224
00:14:50,457 --> 00:14:52,993
Starting to become a habit.

225
00:14:58,031 --> 00:15:00,167
You just missed him, Matt.

226
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:02,369
He went home for lunch today.

227
00:15:02,402 --> 00:15:03,937
Oh, right.

228
00:15:03,971 --> 00:15:06,106
I forgot, he's got an interview.

229
00:15:06,139 --> 00:15:07,207
( Door closes )

230
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:09,642
Frank?

231
00:15:09,676 --> 00:15:11,711
Hello?

232
00:15:11,744 --> 00:15:14,081
Hey, Frank!

233
00:15:14,114 --> 00:15:18,018
Yeah, dad?

234
00:15:18,051 --> 00:15:19,119
What are you doing here?

235
00:15:19,152 --> 00:15:22,389
I thought you were driving
to Boston for the interview.

236
00:15:22,422 --> 00:15:25,092
Yeah. No, it was rescheduled.

237
00:15:25,125 --> 00:15:27,594
- Uh-huh.
- ( footsteps approaching )

238
00:15:27,627 --> 00:15:30,663
Hi, Dr. Fowler.

239
00:15:30,697 --> 00:15:32,499
Oh, hi.

240
00:15:32,532 --> 00:15:34,067
Uh, where are the boys?

241
00:15:34,101 --> 00:15:39,039
Um, they're with my mom.

242
00:15:42,075 --> 00:15:44,711
Um.

243
00:15:44,744 --> 00:15:46,980
Do you like coleslaw?

244
00:15:53,086 --> 00:15:54,554
Mm-mmm.

245
00:15:57,090 --> 00:15:58,325
Have some more.

246
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:01,394
Sure?

247
00:16:16,276 --> 00:16:18,311
I got 'em.

248
00:16:18,345 --> 00:16:21,014
Put your clothes on.

249
00:16:21,048 --> 00:16:22,715
Hands up. Chin up.

250
00:16:22,749 --> 00:16:28,055
- Mom, I want to play.
- All right, all right.

251
00:16:28,088 --> 00:16:30,290
- Hey, mom, there's Frank.
- Here's your hat.

252
00:16:33,226 --> 00:16:35,462
Wave, you guys.

253
00:16:35,495 --> 00:16:37,130
Mom, hurry up. I'm late.

254
00:16:37,164 --> 00:16:39,766
I'm hurrying.
I'm hurrying. I'm hurrying.

255
00:16:39,799 --> 00:16:43,136
You'll play too,
but first, we'll watch him.

256
00:16:43,170 --> 00:16:44,604
Hey, Frank.

257
00:16:44,637 --> 00:16:47,274
Did you tell your mom
how good it was?

258
00:16:47,307 --> 00:16:48,675
How good what was?

259
00:16:48,708 --> 00:16:52,645
Aw, Frank had quite a time
this afternoon.

260
00:16:52,679 --> 00:16:55,448
Loved your coleslaw.
Ate enough for two.

261
00:16:55,482 --> 00:16:57,117
Well, that's what it's for.

262
00:16:59,152 --> 00:17:01,254
- Hot dogs?
- Yeah, I'll take one.

263
00:17:01,288 --> 00:17:02,355
No.

264
00:17:07,427 --> 00:17:09,729
So, how are the kids?

265
00:17:09,762 --> 00:17:12,099
Things okay?

266
00:17:12,132 --> 00:17:13,566
Yeah, they're fine.

267
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:16,436
Good. That's good.

268
00:17:16,469 --> 00:17:19,439
Oh, how was your interview?

269
00:17:19,472 --> 00:17:21,574
It was... it was... it was great.

270
00:17:21,608 --> 00:17:24,611
Good.

271
00:17:24,644 --> 00:17:26,479
Jason!

272
00:17:26,513 --> 00:17:28,281
( Singsongy ) Jason.

273
00:17:31,118 --> 00:17:33,153
She's such a brave girl.

274
00:17:33,186 --> 00:17:36,123
That's it.
You're driving me nuts, ma.

275
00:17:36,156 --> 00:17:37,824
I've had lots of girlfriends

276
00:17:37,857 --> 00:17:41,461
and I don't understand
why this one is any different.

277
00:17:41,494 --> 00:17:43,163
I know you don't.

278
00:17:46,699 --> 00:17:48,801
We're not serious, ma.

279
00:17:51,138 --> 00:17:52,705
No?

280
00:17:52,739 --> 00:17:53,773
No.

281
00:17:56,376 --> 00:17:58,745
It's a summer thing.

282
00:17:58,778 --> 00:18:00,513
Mmm, I see.

283
00:18:29,276 --> 00:18:31,144
How'd you get in this time?

284
00:18:31,178 --> 00:18:32,212
Chimney.

285
00:18:43,923 --> 00:18:47,227
Thank you.

286
00:18:47,260 --> 00:18:48,728
What can I help you with?

287
00:18:50,397 --> 00:18:52,399
I was just dropping
that off for Jason.

288
00:18:52,432 --> 00:18:54,234
What?

289
00:18:54,267 --> 00:18:55,902
That.

290
00:18:55,935 --> 00:19:00,440
I didn't know where
you'd want to put it.

291
00:19:00,473 --> 00:19:02,442
It's about time he got it.

292
00:19:02,475 --> 00:19:04,444
What am I going to do with it?

293
00:19:04,477 --> 00:19:06,513
It is really going to mean
a lot to him, rich.

294
00:19:06,546 --> 00:19:07,856
He's really been
improving lately.

295
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:09,482
Yeah, so I heard.

296
00:19:11,251 --> 00:19:13,586
Would have been nice
if you'd come to his game.

297
00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:15,255
I just got your message.

298
00:19:18,458 --> 00:19:20,159
Where are they, with him?

299
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:23,930
That's none of your business.

300
00:19:23,963 --> 00:19:27,834
I see, they're my boys, but
they're none of my business.

301
00:19:27,867 --> 00:19:31,204
You know what I mean.

302
00:19:31,238 --> 00:19:33,206
Yeah.

303
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:34,741
( Clears throat )

304
00:19:34,774 --> 00:19:36,743
I was thinking
about moving back,

305
00:19:36,776 --> 00:19:39,178
here with you and the boys.

306
00:19:41,714 --> 00:19:43,916
What are you talking about?

307
00:19:43,950 --> 00:19:45,852
What am I talking about?

308
00:19:45,885 --> 00:19:49,256
I'm talking about moving back
is what I'm talking about.

309
00:19:49,289 --> 00:19:52,825
I know what you're thinking.
It's different now.

310
00:19:52,859 --> 00:19:54,694
Yeah?

311
00:19:54,727 --> 00:19:56,195
Yeah.

312
00:19:57,597 --> 00:19:58,765
How's the job?

313
00:19:58,798 --> 00:20:00,633
Your father take you
back on at the cannery?

314
00:20:00,667 --> 00:20:02,402
That's funny.

315
00:20:02,435 --> 00:20:04,437
Still getting checks,
aren't you?

316
00:20:04,471 --> 00:20:07,274
Or do I have to call
my father's accountant?

317
00:20:10,543 --> 00:20:13,580
Hey, did you see my
new rig out there?

318
00:20:13,613 --> 00:20:14,981
It's really nice.

319
00:20:15,014 --> 00:20:16,716
It's not exactly new.

320
00:20:16,749 --> 00:20:18,785
I traded David the truck for it.

321
00:20:18,818 --> 00:20:22,455
It's got room for all of us.
Good grocery-getting car.

322
00:20:25,825 --> 00:20:27,660
You want to take a ride?

323
00:20:27,694 --> 00:20:30,597
Rich, you don't change.

324
00:20:30,630 --> 00:20:32,265
You don't change, do you?

325
00:20:35,468 --> 00:20:37,904
Change? No.

326
00:20:37,937 --> 00:20:40,940
No, I don't change.

327
00:20:40,973 --> 00:20:43,009
Everything around me changes.

328
00:20:43,042 --> 00:20:45,812
You change.

329
00:20:45,845 --> 00:20:48,448
You take my house

330
00:20:48,481 --> 00:20:51,318
and you take my kids

331
00:20:51,351 --> 00:20:53,353
and you fuck this other guy

332
00:20:53,386 --> 00:20:56,489
but me, I don't change at all.

333
00:20:56,523 --> 00:20:58,491
It's not your house.

334
00:20:58,525 --> 00:20:59,859
Oh, really?

335
00:20:59,892 --> 00:21:03,062
No, as far as
( whispers ) fucking goes

336
00:21:03,095 --> 00:21:04,507
who was it that answered
the phone the other morning?

337
00:21:04,531 --> 00:21:05,598
She just...

338
00:21:05,632 --> 00:21:07,300
It doesn't matter. I don't care.

339
00:21:07,334 --> 00:21:09,035
It's not working.

340
00:21:09,068 --> 00:21:11,971
Nat

341
00:21:12,004 --> 00:21:16,376
I just want a chance.

342
00:21:16,409 --> 00:21:17,977
For what?

343
00:21:18,010 --> 00:21:19,622
So you can pretend
they have a real father

344
00:21:19,646 --> 00:21:22,749
- for a few days, and then...
- I am their real father!

345
00:21:22,782 --> 00:21:24,884
I am their father.

346
00:21:24,917 --> 00:21:28,488
No, Richard.
You know what defines a father?

347
00:21:28,521 --> 00:21:31,057
It's what he does.
Not what he promises.

348
00:21:31,090 --> 00:21:35,495
It's being a positive,
consistent presence.

349
00:21:35,528 --> 00:21:37,597
( Chuckling )

350
00:21:40,733 --> 00:21:43,903
A positive, consistent presence.

351
00:21:43,936 --> 00:21:44,904
Wow.

352
00:21:44,937 --> 00:21:47,073
What does that mean?

353
00:21:47,106 --> 00:21:49,075
I just don't get it.

354
00:21:49,108 --> 00:21:51,944
But then I'm not fucking
a college boy, am I?

355
00:21:54,547 --> 00:21:57,417
Look, uh...

356
00:21:57,450 --> 00:21:58,685
Can you just go now?

357
00:21:58,718 --> 00:22:00,887
I don't want you here
when they get back.

358
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:03,890
Oh, you wouldn't want that?

359
00:22:03,923 --> 00:22:05,958
- No.
- No.

360
00:22:05,992 --> 00:22:07,627
No, you have to leave now.

361
00:22:12,865 --> 00:22:14,967
Okay.

362
00:22:15,001 --> 00:22:16,936
I'll see you later, Richard.

363
00:22:16,969 --> 00:22:18,538
Yeah. Good-bye, Nat.

364
00:22:36,623 --> 00:22:40,059
Hey.

365
00:22:40,092 --> 00:22:42,862
You know, I've been ignoring
our difference in age

366
00:22:42,895 --> 00:22:44,764
but you keep playing
with those blocks,

367
00:22:44,797 --> 00:22:47,066
I'm going to start to worry.

368
00:22:48,701 --> 00:22:50,470
You're not looking at the house.

369
00:22:50,503 --> 00:22:51,971
Look.

370
00:22:59,011 --> 00:23:00,647
It's not all mine.

371
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:02,715
It's part Mack.

372
00:23:02,749 --> 00:23:04,984
See, the whole idea
of what Mack was trying

373
00:23:05,017 --> 00:23:08,588
to achieve was a common area
in the center of the house.

374
00:23:08,621 --> 00:23:11,491
I mean, large open spaces,
they weren't unique to Mack,

375
00:23:11,524 --> 00:23:13,493
but the idea of separating
the family

376
00:23:13,526 --> 00:23:16,463
so that the parents
were on one side

377
00:23:16,496 --> 00:23:18,865
and the kids are on the other,

378
00:23:18,898 --> 00:23:21,067
so they'll all spill
into the center.

379
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:24,571
It's brilliant. It's

380
00:23:24,604 --> 00:23:26,673
I'm boring you, aren't I?

381
00:23:26,706 --> 00:23:30,843
No. Mnh-mnh.

382
00:23:30,877 --> 00:23:32,979
I was just thinking.

383
00:23:36,983 --> 00:23:39,652
About what?

384
00:23:39,686 --> 00:23:41,087
About you.

385
00:23:43,089 --> 00:23:44,857
School.

386
00:23:49,161 --> 00:23:52,465
What if I wait a year?

387
00:23:54,634 --> 00:23:57,036
Frank...

388
00:23:57,069 --> 00:23:59,939
- A year is not going to make...
- No, you can't do that, Frank.

389
00:23:59,972 --> 00:24:04,944
Why not?
I've thought a lot about this.

390
00:24:04,977 --> 00:24:07,113
I have, and...

391
00:24:07,146 --> 00:24:09,849
No, y...

392
00:24:09,882 --> 00:24:12,619
You told me it takes forever
just to establish yourself.

393
00:24:12,652 --> 00:24:15,722
Exactly. So what's a year
in forever?

394
00:24:22,995 --> 00:24:24,997
That's twisted logic.

395
00:24:27,133 --> 00:24:29,802
Do you know what Duncan
said to me today?

396
00:24:29,836 --> 00:24:33,806
Oh, you wouldn't be changing
the subject, would you?

397
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:36,242
He said,
"Frank, I don't think Jason

398
00:24:36,275 --> 00:24:38,210
really understands girls."

399
00:24:38,244 --> 00:24:39,946
Oh, he didn't.

400
00:24:39,979 --> 00:24:40,913
He did.

401
00:24:40,947 --> 00:24:42,549
( Both laughing )

402
00:24:42,582 --> 00:24:44,083
"Understands girls."

403
00:24:46,819 --> 00:24:48,220
Well, what'd you say?

404
00:24:48,254 --> 00:24:50,056
I didn't know what
to say to that.

405
00:24:50,089 --> 00:24:53,726
I said, "Give him time, Duncan.
He'll come around."

406
00:24:55,795 --> 00:24:58,097
If this is how he is now,
then we're in trouble.

407
00:25:16,215 --> 00:25:19,852
What is this, Action Man?

408
00:25:19,886 --> 00:25:23,590
Yeah. Richard gave it
to Dunc for his birthday.

409
00:25:36,102 --> 00:25:40,039
( Women singing
Balkan folk song )

410
00:26:01,994 --> 00:26:03,996
Very good.

411
00:26:04,030 --> 00:26:07,634
Okay, it's 7:30.
We should stop now.

412
00:26:07,667 --> 00:26:10,369
Now remember when
you sing these words

413
00:26:10,402 --> 00:26:12,004
the way we feel about the harbor

414
00:26:12,038 --> 00:26:15,107
is how the Balkans felt
about the River Sava.

415
00:26:15,141 --> 00:26:17,009
And listen to your tapes!

416
00:26:17,043 --> 00:26:19,345
"Mmollih ta"
is still very rough,

417
00:26:19,378 --> 00:26:22,114
and we've got
a 40-minute program

418
00:26:22,148 --> 00:26:24,951
to have ready by Labor Day.

419
00:26:24,984 --> 00:26:27,253
Labor Day.

420
00:26:27,286 --> 00:26:28,788
Oh, and Anna?

421
00:26:28,821 --> 00:26:29,889
Yeah, Ms. Fowler?

422
00:26:29,922 --> 00:26:31,624
Next time, duck.

423
00:26:31,658 --> 00:26:34,126
Yoo-hoo.

424
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:37,396
Yeah. Great.

425
00:26:37,429 --> 00:26:39,766
( Groaning )

426
00:26:39,799 --> 00:26:42,068
Dad... is that acid?

427
00:26:42,101 --> 00:26:43,936
What are you putting in there?

428
00:26:43,970 --> 00:26:46,138
Oh, my God. What happened?

429
00:26:46,172 --> 00:26:48,140
Come on, Frank. Hold still.

430
00:26:48,174 --> 00:26:49,241
All right, dad.

431
00:26:49,275 --> 00:26:51,077
This was her husband, wasn't it?

432
00:26:51,110 --> 00:26:53,012
Ex. He dropped in.

433
00:26:53,045 --> 00:26:55,047
You going to press charges?

434
00:26:55,081 --> 00:26:56,315
No.

435
00:26:56,348 --> 00:26:58,217
Well, what's to stop him
from doing it again?

436
00:26:58,250 --> 00:26:59,018
Did you hit him at all?

437
00:26:59,051 --> 00:27:01,087
Come on, tell me tell me
you hit him.

438
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:02,021
- Matt.
- Just so he doesn't do it again.

439
00:27:02,054 --> 00:27:04,657
I don't think I touched him.
Aah! Jesus, Dad.

440
00:27:04,691 --> 00:27:07,259
So what are you going to do?

441
00:27:07,293 --> 00:27:09,028
Take karate?

442
00:27:09,061 --> 00:27:10,797
Oh, that is not the problem.

443
00:27:10,830 --> 00:27:13,032
Mom, you know you like her.

444
00:27:13,065 --> 00:27:15,668
I like a lot of people, Frank.

445
00:27:15,702 --> 00:27:17,704
What about the boys,
did they see it?

446
00:27:17,737 --> 00:27:19,371
No, they were asleep.

447
00:27:19,405 --> 00:27:22,041
Did you leave
her alone with him?

448
00:27:22,074 --> 00:27:25,111
He left first.
She was yelling at him.

449
00:27:25,144 --> 00:27:27,079
I believe she had
a skillet in her hand.

450
00:27:27,113 --> 00:27:29,782
Oh, for God sakes.
Did you call the police?

451
00:27:29,816 --> 00:27:31,083
Not yet.

452
00:27:31,117 --> 00:27:33,419
- You didn't call them?
- Well, I just got in.

453
00:27:33,452 --> 00:27:35,030
When did I have chance
to call the police?

454
00:27:35,054 --> 00:27:37,924
- Where's the phone book?
- No, mom, no, don't call them.

455
00:27:37,957 --> 00:27:39,234
If you call the police,
they'll come over

456
00:27:39,258 --> 00:27:40,893
- and scare the kids.
- Matt?

457
00:27:40,927 --> 00:27:43,229
- We got to call them.
- No, we're not calling them.

458
00:27:43,262 --> 00:27:45,331
It was a scuffle.
That's it. It wasn't serious.

459
00:27:45,364 --> 00:27:48,434
Oh, right, just like the
relationship isn't serious.

460
00:27:48,467 --> 00:27:51,137
Oh, Ruth. Now is not the time.

461
00:27:51,170 --> 00:27:53,148
Well, when is the time, after
he knocks him into a coma?

462
00:27:53,172 --> 00:27:55,141
This is stopping now.

463
00:27:55,174 --> 00:27:57,009
Oh, really?

464
00:27:57,043 --> 00:27:59,078
Come fall, you're on a plane.

465
00:27:59,111 --> 00:28:01,380
Are you taking them with you?

466
00:28:01,413 --> 00:28:04,116
What are the boys going to think
when you just disappear?

467
00:28:04,150 --> 00:28:05,952
Hey, easy, mom.

468
00:28:05,985 --> 00:28:08,855
Frank, this is not some
sweetie from Vassar

469
00:28:08,888 --> 00:28:10,823
that you can visit on holidays.

470
00:28:10,857 --> 00:28:12,358
You're not in this alone.

471
00:28:12,391 --> 00:28:14,961
And the sooner you end it,
the better.

472
00:28:18,464 --> 00:28:20,232
( Quietly ) Oh, God.

473
00:28:20,266 --> 00:28:22,769
What are we going to do?

474
00:28:22,802 --> 00:28:25,772
I don't know.

475
00:28:25,805 --> 00:28:29,075
Well, you've got
to talk to him, Matt.

476
00:28:29,108 --> 00:28:30,777
( Sighs )

477
00:28:30,810 --> 00:28:33,780
I don't know.

478
00:28:33,813 --> 00:28:36,983
Maybe he's right about
scaring the kids.

479
00:28:37,016 --> 00:28:39,518
Why don't we just sleep on it,

480
00:28:39,551 --> 00:28:41,420
deal with it tomorrow?

481
00:28:41,453 --> 00:28:43,956
Are you going to call
the police, or do I have to?

482
00:28:43,990 --> 00:28:45,133
I just told you what I think.

483
00:28:45,157 --> 00:28:47,426
If you want to call them,
call them.

484
00:29:09,315 --> 00:29:12,084
It's not the first time
she's played around, you know.

485
00:29:12,118 --> 00:29:14,921
She's not with the guy anymore.

486
00:29:14,954 --> 00:29:16,088
No, I mean from before.

487
00:29:16,122 --> 00:29:17,824
What are you talking about?

488
00:29:17,857 --> 00:29:20,359
Oh, come on, you've heard
the same things I have.

489
00:29:20,392 --> 00:29:21,828
You seem to forget.

490
00:29:21,861 --> 00:29:24,163
I don't take my lunches
in the teachers' lounge.

491
00:29:31,838 --> 00:29:34,040
Maybe he still loves her.

492
00:29:37,844 --> 00:29:40,847
Best part of the cod.

493
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:42,157
The outsiders,
they won't touch it.

494
00:29:42,181 --> 00:29:44,150
Summer fishermen...

495
00:29:44,183 --> 00:29:46,452
Well, the part-timers
like Frank here...

496
00:29:46,485 --> 00:29:47,987
Get in your hair.

497
00:29:48,020 --> 00:29:50,122
As many as 80 of them
now with licenses.

498
00:29:50,156 --> 00:29:52,158
Hmm. Should've put up a sign.

499
00:29:52,191 --> 00:29:55,094
"Stay in your own backyard,
or lose your traps."

500
00:29:55,127 --> 00:29:57,296
See, Henry here is just sore

501
00:29:57,329 --> 00:29:59,007
'cause I catch about
twice as much as he does

502
00:29:59,031 --> 00:30:01,000
with an old second-hand
Boudreau.

503
00:30:01,033 --> 00:30:04,036
Don't you listen to him, son.
That boat is fine.

504
00:30:04,070 --> 00:30:06,372
She was my first.

505
00:30:06,405 --> 00:30:10,009
I kind of miss her, sometimes.

506
00:30:10,042 --> 00:30:12,311
And that truck you're driving.

507
00:30:12,344 --> 00:30:14,914
When are you headed back
to school, Frank?

508
00:30:14,947 --> 00:30:16,082
Hmm?

509
00:30:16,115 --> 00:30:18,117
( laughing )

510
00:30:31,163 --> 00:30:33,165
Hi, Dr. Fowler.

511
00:30:33,199 --> 00:30:34,466
How you doing, Jason?

512
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:35,601
Good.

513
00:30:45,945 --> 00:30:48,014
What'd you pull?

514
00:30:48,047 --> 00:30:50,549
Not too bad.

515
00:30:50,582 --> 00:30:53,419
About 40 pounds.

516
00:30:53,452 --> 00:30:56,422
I haven't caught sight
of you in days.

517
00:30:56,455 --> 00:30:57,990
You know where to find me.

518
00:30:58,024 --> 00:31:01,027
When are you coming home?

519
00:31:01,060 --> 00:31:03,095
Has it come to this?

520
00:31:03,129 --> 00:31:05,264
Come to what?

521
00:31:05,297 --> 00:31:08,867
You having to run errands
for mom.

522
00:31:12,939 --> 00:31:15,307
I'm thinking of building
a couple hundred more traps,

523
00:31:15,341 --> 00:31:18,344
see if I can do better
than break even.

524
00:31:18,377 --> 00:31:20,112
Take you more than two years

525
00:31:20,146 --> 00:31:22,548
to get a license
to fish off-season.

526
00:31:22,581 --> 00:31:25,084
Right. Unless Henry takes me
on as his stern man.

527
00:31:25,117 --> 00:31:27,119
You think he'd do that?

528
00:31:27,153 --> 00:31:28,654
Maybe.

529
00:31:28,687 --> 00:31:32,191
It's as good a life as any.

530
00:31:32,224 --> 00:31:34,460
It was good enough
for your father

531
00:31:34,493 --> 00:31:37,496
and sometimes things
just skip a generation.

532
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,235
You don't think...

533
00:31:43,269 --> 00:31:46,405
You don't think you
might need something more?

534
00:31:46,438 --> 00:31:48,374
Why?

535
00:31:48,407 --> 00:31:51,978
So I can have an Ivy League
education like you, and

536
00:31:52,011 --> 00:31:55,447
Christ, if it's so great,
how come you sneak

537
00:31:55,481 --> 00:31:58,184
out of the office
every day to come down here?

538
00:32:00,519 --> 00:32:03,655
I like spending time
with my son.

539
00:32:03,689 --> 00:32:05,024
Uh-huh.

540
00:32:19,271 --> 00:32:21,040
I don't know, dad.

541
00:32:24,610 --> 00:32:26,979
It's just... I don't know.

542
00:32:30,116 --> 00:32:32,184
She's a wonderful girl.

543
00:32:34,286 --> 00:32:37,089
And that's what I see.

544
00:32:43,229 --> 00:32:45,031
Hey, Frank!

545
00:32:45,064 --> 00:32:46,432
How long you gonna
be parked there?

546
00:32:46,465 --> 00:32:48,400
I'd like to unload!

547
00:32:48,434 --> 00:32:50,136
Give me a hand?

548
00:32:50,169 --> 00:32:51,470
Yeah, sure.

549
00:33:02,381 --> 00:33:07,153
You can't hypnotize the cards
into changing, Matt.

550
00:33:07,186 --> 00:33:10,056
For Christ sake, bet,
or you know Carl's gonna start.

551
00:33:10,089 --> 00:33:13,059
The begger's dog
and the widow's cat.

552
00:33:13,092 --> 00:33:15,094
Feed them
and thou wilt grow fat.

553
00:33:15,127 --> 00:33:18,064
The gnat sings
his summer's song.

554
00:33:18,097 --> 00:33:20,399
Poison gets
from slander's tongue.

555
00:33:20,432 --> 00:33:23,269
The poison of the snake and newt

556
00:33:23,302 --> 00:33:25,804
is the sweat of envy's foot.

557
00:33:25,837 --> 00:33:29,275
The poison of the honeybee
is the artist's jealousy.

558
00:33:29,308 --> 00:33:32,611
All right, Carl. Two bucks.

559
00:33:32,644 --> 00:33:35,414
I'll tell you, man, you got
to get out of this Blake thing.

560
00:33:35,447 --> 00:33:37,149
You're in a rut.

561
00:33:37,183 --> 00:33:38,617
Don't get him started, Matt.

562
00:33:38,650 --> 00:33:41,387
Whenever I do my own stuff,
you guys bitch and moan.

563
00:33:41,420 --> 00:33:43,489
- That's not true!
- We love your stuff.

564
00:33:43,522 --> 00:33:46,325
- It's great stuff, right?
- ( laughter )

565
00:33:46,358 --> 00:33:47,626
Carl?

566
00:33:47,659 --> 00:33:48,727
I'm in.

567
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:50,762
Everybody in? Frankie, you in?

568
00:33:55,434 --> 00:33:57,103
( All groaning )

569
00:33:57,136 --> 00:33:58,437
Guess I'm the winner.

570
00:33:58,470 --> 00:33:59,771
Always the quiet ones.

571
00:33:59,805 --> 00:34:02,108
Deal.

572
00:34:02,141 --> 00:34:04,076
Come on. Come on.

573
00:34:19,358 --> 00:34:21,193
Don't mind me.

574
00:34:21,227 --> 00:34:23,229
Your father's snoring.

575
00:34:27,499 --> 00:34:29,401
( Sniffs ) Ugh...

576
00:34:42,614 --> 00:34:44,316
Eat.

577
00:34:44,350 --> 00:34:46,452
You must be hungry.

578
00:34:46,485 --> 00:34:48,620
I'm not hungry.

579
00:34:48,654 --> 00:34:50,556
Coffee?

580
00:34:57,496 --> 00:34:59,765
So you talked to her?

581
00:34:59,798 --> 00:35:02,268
Yeah.

582
00:35:05,237 --> 00:35:07,806
And how is she?

583
00:35:07,839 --> 00:35:09,708
She's great.

584
00:35:13,412 --> 00:35:17,816
Frank, I just I just
wanted to tell you that we...

585
00:35:17,849 --> 00:35:19,785
That I liked her.

586
00:35:19,818 --> 00:35:21,720
Do like her.

587
00:35:21,753 --> 00:35:24,790
She's a wonderful girl.

588
00:35:24,823 --> 00:35:27,159
Ma, you're not really
going to have this conversation

589
00:35:27,193 --> 00:35:29,228
with me right now, are you?

590
00:35:40,539 --> 00:35:42,808
- Good night.
- Good night.

591
00:35:47,946 --> 00:35:49,781
Okay. All right.
No, that's fine, sir.

592
00:35:49,815 --> 00:35:52,684
I'll send it to you right away.

593
00:35:52,718 --> 00:35:54,453
Okay.

594
00:35:54,486 --> 00:35:55,887
Oh, yes, I'm very excited.

595
00:35:55,921 --> 00:35:57,856
I'm, uh...

596
00:35:57,889 --> 00:36:00,559
It's a beautiful campus, and I'm

597
00:36:00,592 --> 00:36:02,861
I'm, uh, preparing already.

598
00:36:02,894 --> 00:36:06,832
Yes. Oh, thank you.
Thank you, sir.

599
00:36:06,865 --> 00:36:09,868
Yes, well,
compared to your models...

600
00:36:09,901 --> 00:36:12,904
It doesn't compare to your
models, but

601
00:36:12,938 --> 00:36:16,642
I am.
I'm aware of the Lautner House.

602
00:36:16,675 --> 00:36:18,644
Yeah.

603
00:36:18,677 --> 00:36:21,647
Excuse me, sir,
can you hold on one second?

604
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:24,316
( Beep )

605
00:36:24,350 --> 00:36:26,918
Hello?

606
00:36:26,952 --> 00:36:29,221
Jase?

607
00:36:29,255 --> 00:36:31,457
Jase, what is it?

608
00:36:35,694 --> 00:36:37,863
Okay, Jason, stay put.

609
00:36:37,896 --> 00:36:40,532
I'll be right there. Stay put.

610
00:36:40,566 --> 00:36:43,402
Natalie: He just, um

611
00:36:43,435 --> 00:36:47,239
he just pushed me,
he didn't hit me.

612
00:36:47,273 --> 00:36:48,874
He didn't hit you. That's great.

613
00:36:48,907 --> 00:36:50,909
We should throw a party for him.
He didn't hit you.

614
00:36:50,942 --> 00:36:52,711
Frank.

615
00:36:52,744 --> 00:36:54,780
That's enough of this.
We're calling the police.

616
00:36:54,813 --> 00:36:56,023
No, w-w-w-w-w-wait,
wait... uh-uh.

617
00:36:56,047 --> 00:36:57,649
Natalie,
we're calling the police.

618
00:36:57,683 --> 00:37:00,018
No, no, I don't...
I don't know what I want to do.

619
00:37:00,051 --> 00:37:01,820
I don't... I hate this.

620
00:37:01,853 --> 00:37:03,622
I hate the kids seeing this.

621
00:37:03,655 --> 00:37:05,657
I... I don't know what to do.

622
00:37:05,691 --> 00:37:08,026
( Sobbing )

623
00:37:08,059 --> 00:37:09,961
Hey, it's okay. It's okay.

624
00:37:09,995 --> 00:37:14,566
I'm here now. I'm here now.
It's all right.

625
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:15,967
I'm not going anywhere.

626
00:37:16,001 --> 00:37:18,604
Okay.

627
00:37:18,637 --> 00:37:22,040
It's all right.

628
00:37:22,073 --> 00:37:26,011
Okay, okay.

629
00:37:26,044 --> 00:37:26,978
Mom!

630
00:37:27,012 --> 00:37:28,680
Oh!

631
00:37:28,714 --> 00:37:30,716
( Pounding on door )

632
00:37:30,749 --> 00:37:35,020
Go upstairs with the kids.

633
00:37:35,053 --> 00:37:36,322
No. I'm afraid.

634
00:37:36,355 --> 00:37:37,656
Natalie, go upstairs!

635
00:37:37,689 --> 00:37:39,066
I'm not letting him in
the house! Go upstairs!

636
00:37:39,090 --> 00:37:41,593
No. Uh-uh.

637
00:37:41,627 --> 00:37:42,994
It's better if
he doesn't see you.

638
00:37:43,028 --> 00:37:44,363
Go upstairs.

639
00:37:44,396 --> 00:37:45,897
Don't let him in.
Don't let him in.

640
00:37:45,931 --> 00:37:47,766
- Go.
- Frank, don't let him in.

641
00:37:47,799 --> 00:37:50,436
Richard: Open the door!

642
00:37:52,371 --> 00:37:56,808
Frank? Frank, buddy,
you in there?

643
00:37:56,842 --> 00:37:59,845
Frank, I'm really sorry about
what happened, all right?

644
00:37:59,878 --> 00:38:02,848
I apologize.
I'm sorry about what happened.

645
00:38:02,881 --> 00:38:04,049
Now open the door.

646
00:38:04,082 --> 00:38:07,486
Richard, leave. Leave now!

647
00:38:07,519 --> 00:38:08,887
I'm not letting you
in this door.

648
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:10,522
She left. Natalie is gone.

649
00:38:10,556 --> 00:38:12,458
She's not here,
and I'm calling the police

650
00:38:12,491 --> 00:38:14,426
if you don't leave.

651
00:38:14,460 --> 00:38:16,094
Just go.

652
00:38:16,127 --> 00:38:18,330
All right. All right.

653
00:38:35,046 --> 00:38:40,752
( Rattling )

654
00:38:40,786 --> 00:38:42,020
Motherfucker!

655
00:38:42,053 --> 00:38:43,389
Read him a story.

656
00:38:43,422 --> 00:38:44,890
I'll be right back, okay?

657
00:38:44,923 --> 00:38:46,024
I don't want to stay here!

658
00:38:46,057 --> 00:38:48,594
You have to.
You have to stay here.

659
00:38:48,627 --> 00:38:49,995
You have to stay here.
Look at me.

660
00:38:50,028 --> 00:38:52,698
You're staying here, okay?
Read him a story.

661
00:38:52,731 --> 00:38:53,999
Jason: Clock, clock, tick-tock.

662
00:38:54,032 --> 00:38:56,101
Where's the clock?
What time is it?

663
00:38:56,134 --> 00:38:58,370
You're fucking lying!
Where is she? Natalie!

664
00:38:58,404 --> 00:39:00,539
Put that away! Put that away!

665
00:39:00,572 --> 00:39:01,773
( Gunshot )

666
00:39:01,807 --> 00:39:03,041
( Screams )

667
00:39:11,683 --> 00:39:13,685
No!

668
00:39:13,719 --> 00:39:18,857
( Sobbing ) No!

669
00:39:18,890 --> 00:39:20,726
( Running footsteps )

670
00:39:20,759 --> 00:39:22,761
Mommy!

671
00:39:26,732 --> 00:39:28,967
( Intercom beeps )

672
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,036
Woman: Matt, there's a
Mrs. Strout on line two.

673
00:39:31,069 --> 00:39:32,904
She says it's very important.

674
00:39:34,706 --> 00:39:35,974
Hello?

675
00:39:38,109 --> 00:39:39,545
Hello, Natalie?

676
00:39:42,013 --> 00:39:45,684
( Choir singing haunting
Balkan folk song )

677
00:39:54,125 --> 00:39:57,128
( Singing continues )

678
00:40:17,983 --> 00:40:19,084
Great.

679
00:40:28,226 --> 00:40:29,995
Priest: Your fear of death

680
00:40:30,028 --> 00:40:32,664
is but the trembling
of the shepherd

681
00:40:32,698 --> 00:40:34,800
when he stands before the king

682
00:40:34,833 --> 00:40:37,936
whose hand is to be
laid upon him in honor.

683
00:40:37,969 --> 00:40:42,040
Is the shepherd not joyful
beneath his trembling

684
00:40:42,073 --> 00:40:44,810
that he should wear
the mark of the king?

685
00:40:44,843 --> 00:40:48,480
Yet is he not more mindful
of his trembling?

686
00:40:48,514 --> 00:40:50,716
For what is it to die

687
00:40:50,749 --> 00:40:53,752
but to stand naked in the wind

688
00:40:53,785 --> 00:40:56,087
and to melt into the sun?

689
00:40:56,121 --> 00:40:58,490
And what is it
to cease breathing

690
00:40:58,524 --> 00:41:02,694
but to free the breath
from its restless tides

691
00:41:02,728 --> 00:41:08,199
that it may rise and expand
and see god unencumbered?

692
00:41:08,233 --> 00:41:11,803
Only when you drink
from the river of silence

693
00:41:11,837 --> 00:41:13,605
shall you indeed sing.

694
00:41:13,639 --> 00:41:16,074
And when you have reached
the mountaintop

695
00:41:16,107 --> 00:41:19,177
then you shall begin to climb.

696
00:41:19,210 --> 00:41:22,681
And when the earth
shall claim your limbs

697
00:41:22,714 --> 00:41:25,551
then shall you truly dance.

698
00:41:28,987 --> 00:41:30,989
( Subdued indistinct
conversation )

699
00:41:47,105 --> 00:41:48,874
( laughing )

700
00:42:17,769 --> 00:42:19,104
Can I get you anything?

701
00:42:21,339 --> 00:42:25,611
Uh... where's Ruth?

702
00:42:25,644 --> 00:42:27,579
She went to lie down, Matt.

703
00:42:30,649 --> 00:42:32,017
Excuse me.

704
00:44:42,113 --> 00:44:43,715
( Applause on television )

705
00:44:43,749 --> 00:44:46,484
Man: My next guest is
a very talented funnyman

706
00:44:46,517 --> 00:44:49,320
who will be performing live
at the end of the month

707
00:44:49,354 --> 00:44:52,323
at the Montreal Comedy Festival
"Just for Laughs."

708
00:44:52,357 --> 00:44:54,325
Please welcome Anthony Clark!

709
00:44:54,359 --> 00:44:56,361
( Cheers and applause )

710
00:45:05,170 --> 00:45:06,304
Clark: Wow.

711
00:45:06,337 --> 00:45:07,305
Host: How we doing?

712
00:45:07,338 --> 00:45:10,876
They're so nice. Wow.

713
00:45:10,909 --> 00:45:12,878
- They're good people.
- They really are.

714
00:45:12,911 --> 00:45:15,180
Some of them were packing,
but we've cleared that up.

715
00:45:15,213 --> 00:45:16,915
- That's good.
- So what's been going on?

716
00:45:16,948 --> 00:45:19,017
Well, you know, I've actually

717
00:45:19,050 --> 00:45:21,052
been out with Ricky Martin,
livin' the vida loca.

718
00:45:21,086 --> 00:45:22,754
( laughter )

719
00:45:22,788 --> 00:45:24,022
You know Ricky?

720
00:45:24,055 --> 00:45:25,791
Actually, when you hang out
with Ricky,

721
00:45:25,824 --> 00:45:27,759
a lot of people want
to speak Spanish to you.

722
00:45:27,793 --> 00:45:29,027
And I think that's cool.

723
00:45:29,060 --> 00:45:35,500
I took three years
of Spanish in high school...

724
00:45:47,478 --> 00:45:49,480
( lawnmower in distance )

725
00:46:04,595 --> 00:46:06,932
( Knock on door )

726
00:46:08,934 --> 00:46:10,101
( Knock on door )

727
00:46:10,135 --> 00:46:12,437
Yeah?

728
00:46:12,470 --> 00:46:16,842
Matt, I'm going to go to lunch.

729
00:46:16,875 --> 00:46:18,076
Okay.

730
00:46:18,109 --> 00:46:20,411
Can I get you anything?

731
00:46:23,148 --> 00:46:26,084
No, I'm fine.

732
00:46:26,117 --> 00:46:27,919
Are you sure?

733
00:46:30,421 --> 00:46:35,861
Yeah, I'm... I'm okay.

734
00:46:35,894 --> 00:46:37,428
Okay.

735
00:46:54,045 --> 00:46:56,147
( Dinnerware clattering )

736
00:47:01,119 --> 00:47:03,922
Don't worry, I didn't make them.

737
00:47:05,490 --> 00:47:06,858
I wanted the cheese.

738
00:47:06,892 --> 00:47:10,028
What? Oh. That's mine.

739
00:47:10,061 --> 00:47:12,397
( Chuckles ) Sorry.

740
00:47:19,270 --> 00:47:21,506
You got back to work
so quick, Matt.

741
00:47:21,539 --> 00:47:22,908
It's not too soon?

742
00:47:22,941 --> 00:47:26,344
I can't stay home.

743
00:47:26,377 --> 00:47:27,612
So, how's business?

744
00:47:27,645 --> 00:47:29,414
Oh, you know, same old crap.

745
00:47:29,447 --> 00:47:32,117
Got held up again.
Well, you knew that.

746
00:47:32,150 --> 00:47:33,919
- No, I didn't.
- Yeah.

747
00:47:33,952 --> 00:47:36,287
They got 75 bucks.

748
00:47:36,321 --> 00:47:38,023
Were you on the till?

749
00:47:38,056 --> 00:47:40,558
They'd have gotten something
else if I'd been on the till.

750
00:47:40,591 --> 00:47:42,193
( Both chuckle )

751
00:47:45,430 --> 00:47:48,433
So, how you doing, Matt?
You don't write, you don't call.

752
00:47:48,466 --> 00:47:50,035
Where'd the love go?

753
00:47:50,068 --> 00:47:51,569
Nag, nag, nag.

754
00:47:51,602 --> 00:47:53,071
( Chuckling )

755
00:48:01,146 --> 00:48:03,414
They set the bail hearing yet?

756
00:48:03,448 --> 00:48:07,318
Uh, sometime in
the next few days, yeah.

757
00:48:07,352 --> 00:48:08,486
Are you going?

758
00:48:08,519 --> 00:48:11,189
I don't know.

759
00:48:13,724 --> 00:48:17,929
Davis says it's
a formality, really.

760
00:48:17,963 --> 00:48:19,497
I haven't talked with Ruth

761
00:48:19,530 --> 00:48:21,666
about whether or not
she thinks we ought to go.

762
00:48:21,699 --> 00:48:24,569
If it's too much for Ruth,
I'll come with you.

763
00:48:24,602 --> 00:48:25,670
Thanks.

764
00:48:25,703 --> 00:48:28,206
Uh, it'll be all right.

765
00:48:29,707 --> 00:48:32,210
Davis says it's
a formality, really.

766
00:48:34,145 --> 00:48:37,148
The criminal trial set yet?

767
00:48:39,584 --> 00:48:41,552
Uh, October.

768
00:48:41,586 --> 00:48:42,553
October?

769
00:48:42,587 --> 00:48:44,055
That's what they tell me.

770
00:48:44,089 --> 00:48:47,392
Christ, they take their time.

771
00:48:47,425 --> 00:48:49,160
Well, he's in there now.

772
00:48:49,194 --> 00:48:52,130
They're keeping him busy,
I'm sure.

773
00:48:52,163 --> 00:48:54,243
You know where they'll
move him, once he's sentenced?

774
00:48:56,201 --> 00:48:58,203
Got any, uh, Tabasco?

775
00:49:01,039 --> 00:49:03,741
Hey, Anita! Tabasco!

776
00:49:03,774 --> 00:49:06,244
Hey!

777
00:49:06,277 --> 00:49:08,113
Aw, shit.

778
00:49:26,564 --> 00:49:28,099
Next weekend, Matt,

779
00:49:28,133 --> 00:49:30,368
we really want you to
come up to the camp.

780
00:49:30,401 --> 00:49:32,370
Katie's insisting.

781
00:49:32,403 --> 00:49:35,206
Not to pressure you or anything,
but if you don't come

782
00:49:35,240 --> 00:49:37,308
she's going to invite her
sister and that idiot

783
00:49:37,342 --> 00:49:39,577
and I'm going to wind up
insulting him again.

784
00:49:39,610 --> 00:49:43,081
The future of my family
is in your hands.

785
00:49:43,114 --> 00:49:46,217
Uh... let me ask Ruth.

786
00:49:48,486 --> 00:49:50,131
Woman on television:
So the combination of spices

787
00:49:50,155 --> 00:49:52,090
is very Southern,
and I'll tell you

788
00:49:52,123 --> 00:49:54,192
what makes it Southern.

789
00:49:54,225 --> 00:49:57,495
There are coriander seeds,
which I'm going to put...

790
00:49:57,528 --> 00:50:00,465
- Hi!
- How was your day?

791
00:50:00,498 --> 00:50:03,134
Fine.

792
00:50:03,168 --> 00:50:06,137
I had lunch with Willis.

793
00:50:06,171 --> 00:50:07,472
It was really great to see him.

794
00:50:07,505 --> 00:50:10,007
My day was fine, too, thanks.

795
00:50:11,176 --> 00:50:13,411
Sorry, did you say something?

796
00:50:15,246 --> 00:50:16,714
No.

797
00:50:21,086 --> 00:50:23,488
Katie and Willis invited us

798
00:50:23,521 --> 00:50:26,291
up to the camp for the weekend.

799
00:50:26,324 --> 00:50:27,658
I said I'd check with you

800
00:50:27,692 --> 00:50:31,096
in case we were doing
something else.

801
00:50:31,129 --> 00:50:34,132
That sounds fine.

802
00:50:36,134 --> 00:50:38,803
We, uh, we don't have to go.

803
00:50:38,836 --> 00:50:41,439
You don't want to?

804
00:50:41,472 --> 00:50:43,841
Yeah, I want to.

805
00:50:43,874 --> 00:50:45,776
Then tell them yes.

806
00:50:45,810 --> 00:50:51,449
Well, I thought you might be
busy getting the girls ready.

807
00:50:54,419 --> 00:50:57,155
No.

808
00:51:00,158 --> 00:51:01,292
Okay.

809
00:51:15,673 --> 00:51:17,608
All right,
the next matter is the matter

810
00:51:17,642 --> 00:51:20,345
of State of Maine
v. Richard Strout.

811
00:51:20,378 --> 00:51:22,313
The record should reflect

812
00:51:22,347 --> 00:51:24,415
that the defendant
has been incarcerated

813
00:51:24,449 --> 00:51:26,117
in the Knox County Jail
without bail

814
00:51:26,151 --> 00:51:28,886
since the 17th of July.

815
00:51:28,919 --> 00:51:31,622
We're here for a bail hearing.

816
00:51:31,656 --> 00:51:33,391
Mr. Davis, given the fact

817
00:51:33,424 --> 00:51:35,493
that we have a very
crowded trial calendar

818
00:51:35,526 --> 00:51:37,695
I'm going to suggest that we do
both the bail hearing

819
00:51:37,728 --> 00:51:40,665
and the probable cause hearing
today at 2:00.

820
00:51:40,698 --> 00:51:43,168
So unless I hear any
objection to the contrary.

821
00:51:43,201 --> 00:51:44,402
I'd like to set it for 2:00,

822
00:51:44,435 --> 00:51:47,305
and we will take testimony
of your witnesses at that time.

823
00:51:49,174 --> 00:51:51,909
Natalie: I

824
00:51:51,942 --> 00:51:53,844
I closed the door.

825
00:51:58,883 --> 00:52:01,319
I

826
00:52:01,352 --> 00:52:04,822
I walked t-through my room.

827
00:52:07,458 --> 00:52:09,694
( Voice breaking)
I heard some yelling.

828
00:52:09,727 --> 00:52:14,232
I heard yelling. Heard yelling.

829
00:52:14,265 --> 00:52:15,866
I got to the stairs

830
00:52:23,508 --> 00:52:25,443
( sighs )

831
00:52:25,476 --> 00:52:27,945
And then I heard

832
00:52:27,978 --> 00:52:30,481
I heard the shot.

833
00:52:33,818 --> 00:52:34,952
Richard...

834
00:52:34,985 --> 00:52:37,322
- Lawyer: I-I'm sorry.
- ( sobs ) Richard...

835
00:52:37,355 --> 00:52:40,225
Could we go back just a minute?

836
00:52:40,258 --> 00:52:44,262
Mrs. Strout, you said
you heard the shot.

837
00:52:44,295 --> 00:52:46,264
Yes.

838
00:52:46,297 --> 00:52:48,833
You heard the shot?

839
00:52:48,866 --> 00:52:51,236
Did you actually witness
the accident?

840
00:52:51,269 --> 00:52:52,779
Objection, your honor,
there are no grounds

841
00:52:52,803 --> 00:52:53,914
to indicate this
was an accident.

842
00:52:53,938 --> 00:52:55,340
Sustained.

843
00:52:55,373 --> 00:52:58,609
Strike the word "accident"
from the record.

844
00:52:58,643 --> 00:53:02,780
Rephrase your question,
Ms. Keyes.

845
00:53:02,813 --> 00:53:06,651
Mrs. Strout, in the
police report you stated

846
00:53:06,684 --> 00:53:11,489
that you had witnessed
the firearm discharge.

847
00:53:13,591 --> 00:53:16,193
Did you witness
the firearm discharge?

848
00:53:34,379 --> 00:53:36,881
I thought you said there
would be a jury trial

849
00:53:36,914 --> 00:53:38,783
some time in October.

850
00:53:38,816 --> 00:53:40,418
If he was incarcerated

851
00:53:40,451 --> 00:53:42,520
the judge would have set
an October court date

852
00:53:42,553 --> 00:53:43,921
basically to save the county

853
00:53:43,954 --> 00:53:46,724
the cost of housing
and feeding him as an inmate.

854
00:53:46,757 --> 00:53:51,362
But, with bail, unfortunately,
the court date is always later.

855
00:53:51,396 --> 00:53:53,731
You mean there's nothing
we can do about this?

856
00:53:53,764 --> 00:53:55,266
You let that bastard
just walk out,

857
00:53:55,300 --> 00:53:57,402
and we're supposed
to just sit here?

858
00:53:57,435 --> 00:54:00,938
We can't appeal bail.
It's just not set up that way.

859
00:54:00,971 --> 00:54:06,344
The state's ball code is to
ensure future court appearances.

860
00:54:06,377 --> 00:54:08,546
Now, in this case,
Strout's family was prepared

861
00:54:08,579 --> 00:54:10,848
to put up a substantial
amount of property as bail.

862
00:54:10,881 --> 00:54:14,752
That, along with his ties
to the community

863
00:54:14,785 --> 00:54:16,654
made it very hard for us
to convince a judge

864
00:54:16,687 --> 00:54:18,856
that there was a serious
risk of flight.

865
00:54:18,889 --> 00:54:21,392
Now, you can file a civil suit.

866
00:54:21,426 --> 00:54:24,762
I recommend it. But not now.

867
00:54:24,795 --> 00:54:26,331
Wait until after
the criminal trial.

868
00:54:26,364 --> 00:54:28,399
Ruth: And when will that be?

869
00:54:28,433 --> 00:54:33,871
Well, honestly could be anywhere
from 12 to 18 months.

870
00:54:33,904 --> 00:54:36,006
Oh, my God.

871
00:54:36,040 --> 00:54:39,577
You're confident you can put him
away for good then, right?

872
00:54:49,854 --> 00:54:54,559
The things she said in there,
what's the damage?

873
00:54:57,127 --> 00:55:03,768
The way this is going,
potentially manslaughter.

874
00:55:03,801 --> 00:55:06,371
Jesus Christ.

875
00:55:06,404 --> 00:55:09,674
He killed our son!

876
00:55:09,707 --> 00:55:12,710
He... it was no accident.

877
00:55:12,743 --> 00:55:16,547
Ruth, Ruth, Ruth, Ruth.

878
00:55:16,581 --> 00:55:21,386
Uh. How long will
he be sent away for?

879
00:55:21,419 --> 00:55:22,920
Well, that's hard
to say, really.

880
00:55:22,953 --> 00:55:25,122
Anywhere from five to 15 years.

881
00:55:25,155 --> 00:55:27,892
But we're confident that
we'll get the maximum.

882
00:55:27,925 --> 00:55:30,027
- So even with good behavior...
- Five years?

883
00:55:30,060 --> 00:55:32,463
- He'll do ten full years.
- Ten years?

884
00:55:32,497 --> 00:55:33,898
Are you out of your mind?!

885
00:55:36,734 --> 00:55:39,504
Dr. Fowler, Mrs. Fowler,
I'm sorry.

886
00:55:39,537 --> 00:55:41,539
I understand.

887
00:55:41,572 --> 00:55:45,810
No, you don't.

888
00:55:45,843 --> 00:55:47,912
( Whispering ) No, you don't.

889
00:56:34,725 --> 00:56:36,894
Reporter: Dr. Fowler,
what will your next step be?

890
00:56:36,927 --> 00:56:38,696
Matt: Uh, I don't know.

891
00:56:38,729 --> 00:56:40,498
Reporter: Dr. Fowler,
how do you feel

892
00:56:40,531 --> 00:56:41,799
about the result today?

893
00:56:41,832 --> 00:56:47,104
Matt: Well, that's...
That's something

894
00:56:47,137 --> 00:56:49,082
Dr. Fowler, have you had
any contact with Mrs. Strout?

895
00:56:49,106 --> 00:56:50,708
Matt: No.

896
00:56:50,741 --> 00:56:53,478
How's Mrs. Fowler handling this?

897
00:56:57,081 --> 00:56:59,984
Do you feel that justice
has been served today?

898
00:57:00,017 --> 00:57:02,820
I think our legal system
will determine that.

899
00:57:02,853 --> 00:57:05,022
( Camera shutter clicking )

900
00:57:05,055 --> 00:57:10,027
( Reporters clamoring )

901
00:57:10,060 --> 00:57:11,829
- ( Door closes )
- Can you believe this?

902
00:57:11,862 --> 00:57:15,466
I ask those idiots to leave,
and no one budges, not one.

903
00:57:15,500 --> 00:57:17,768
What are we supposed to do,
make them sandwiches?

904
00:57:17,802 --> 00:57:19,704
What are you asking for?

905
00:57:19,737 --> 00:57:21,005
What?

906
00:57:21,038 --> 00:57:24,074
If you want them to leave,
tell them to leave.

907
00:57:27,778 --> 00:57:30,047
Okay, I'll tell them to leave.

908
00:57:30,080 --> 00:57:31,080
Good.

909
00:57:41,091 --> 00:57:42,636
Woman on television:
And they never come up

910
00:57:42,660 --> 00:57:43,761
to the standard.

911
00:57:43,794 --> 00:57:45,963
And so they're always and
forever disappointed.

912
00:57:45,996 --> 00:57:48,533
Always.
They're never doing enough.

913
00:57:48,566 --> 00:57:49,934
They're never
working hard enough.

914
00:57:49,967 --> 00:57:51,211
They never behaved right enough.

915
00:57:51,235 --> 00:57:53,003
They were never
a good enough father

916
00:57:53,037 --> 00:57:54,271
never a good enough husband.

917
00:57:54,304 --> 00:57:57,608
And not only can they not
please themselves sad to say,

918
00:57:57,642 --> 00:57:59,944
most of the time nobody else
can please them either.

919
00:58:14,659 --> 00:58:17,194
You slept late for you.

920
00:58:17,227 --> 00:58:21,131
Yeah, I took one of your pills.

921
00:58:21,165 --> 00:58:23,233
You never do that.

922
00:58:23,267 --> 00:58:26,804
Mmm.

923
00:58:26,837 --> 00:58:29,940
Well, there it is
in black and white.

924
00:58:29,974 --> 00:58:31,942
You should read some
of the things he says.

925
00:58:31,976 --> 00:58:35,546
It's unbelievable.

926
00:58:35,580 --> 00:58:36,981
Yeah.

927
00:58:41,652 --> 00:58:44,955
Well, I, uh, I better be going.

928
00:58:44,989 --> 00:58:46,957
Where? It's Saturday.

929
00:58:46,991 --> 00:58:51,662
Oh, there's some stuff I have
to catch up on at the office.

930
00:58:51,696 --> 00:58:53,964
I won't be long.

931
00:59:00,237 --> 00:59:05,109
( Door opens and closes )

932
00:59:09,947 --> 00:59:12,016
( Cash register keys beeping,
receipt printing )

933
00:59:13,751 --> 00:59:16,186
Thank you.

934
00:59:16,220 --> 00:59:18,155
Do you want your receipt?

935
00:59:23,360 --> 00:59:24,729
Matt: Natalie.

936
00:59:26,396 --> 00:59:28,165
Hi.

937
00:59:28,198 --> 00:59:30,601
Hi.

938
00:59:30,635 --> 00:59:34,304
I, uh, hope I'm not
disturbing you.

939
00:59:34,338 --> 00:59:37,041
Unh-unh.

940
00:59:37,074 --> 00:59:39,944
Not at all.

941
00:59:39,977 --> 00:59:43,347
Could you break a 50, please?

942
00:59:43,380 --> 00:59:44,715
Excuse me.

943
00:59:46,817 --> 00:59:49,620
( Register beeps, whirs )

944
00:59:54,992 --> 00:59:56,894
Thank you, dear.

945
00:59:56,927 --> 00:59:58,963
Could I possibly have
another bag?

946
00:59:58,996 --> 01:00:00,030
Oh, sure.

947
01:00:08,806 --> 01:00:11,208
( Door bell tinkles )

948
01:00:11,241 --> 01:00:16,213
Yeah, well, I was just, uh...
just wondering how you're doing.

949
01:00:18,082 --> 01:00:20,951
I tried to reach you.

950
01:00:20,985 --> 01:00:22,920
Oh.

951
01:00:22,953 --> 01:00:25,422
Um.

952
01:00:25,455 --> 01:00:27,091
We're at my mom's now.

953
01:00:29,994 --> 01:00:31,962
I wanted to call you.

954
01:00:31,996 --> 01:00:34,031
That's... that's okay.

955
01:00:37,234 --> 01:00:41,038
Dr. Fowler, I

956
01:00:41,071 --> 01:00:42,406
can't

957
01:00:42,439 --> 01:00:44,374
yeah, I-I know.

958
01:00:52,249 --> 01:00:54,051
I didn't lie.

959
01:00:56,353 --> 01:00:59,023
I didn't lie the first time.

960
01:00:59,056 --> 01:01:00,691
It was...

961
01:01:03,961 --> 01:01:05,362
It's how it came out.

962
01:01:07,131 --> 01:01:09,133
( Door bell tinkles )

963
01:01:12,002 --> 01:01:15,272
Mrs. Fowler?

964
01:01:15,305 --> 01:01:17,141
No, uh...

965
01:01:17,174 --> 01:01:18,909
Man: Can I get a pack
of Marlboro Reds?

966
01:01:27,051 --> 01:01:28,919
( Register beeping )

967
01:01:33,924 --> 01:01:35,325
( Bangs register )

968
01:01:35,359 --> 01:01:37,361
( Receipt printing )

969
01:01:41,431 --> 01:01:43,000
( Door bell tinkles )

970
01:01:43,033 --> 01:01:45,102
( Door closes )

971
01:01:45,135 --> 01:01:48,305
How are the boys?

972
01:01:48,338 --> 01:01:49,740
They all right?

973
01:01:52,376 --> 01:01:53,978
Yeah.

974
01:01:57,181 --> 01:02:00,350
Uh, I got to go.

975
01:02:00,384 --> 01:02:02,419
I'll see you.

976
01:02:16,066 --> 01:02:17,868
So how much of this is yours?

977
01:02:17,902 --> 01:02:21,105
( Chuckles )
You ask me that every time.

978
01:02:21,138 --> 01:02:23,407
You know the cove,
the other side of the cabin?

979
01:02:23,440 --> 01:02:24,408
Yeah.

980
01:02:24,441 --> 01:02:26,844
All the way to
the other shoreline.

981
01:02:26,877 --> 01:02:29,513
Almost 350 acres.

982
01:02:29,546 --> 01:02:31,215
Know what it went for
when I bought it?

983
01:02:31,248 --> 01:02:32,249
No.

984
01:02:32,282 --> 01:02:33,818
You don't want to know.

985
01:02:33,851 --> 01:02:34,919
( Both chuckle )

986
01:02:41,992 --> 01:02:44,461
Oh, and that's little Charles
down at the pool.

987
01:02:44,494 --> 01:02:47,865
He figured out how to
get down to the pool

988
01:02:47,898 --> 01:02:50,901
on the elevator by himself.

989
01:02:50,935 --> 01:02:52,369
Oh, he must've been very proud.

990
01:02:52,402 --> 01:02:54,204
Oh, yeah.

991
01:02:54,238 --> 01:02:56,206
Oh, and that's Shannon
waiting in line for...

992
01:02:56,240 --> 01:02:58,843
Oh, my God, that roller coaster.

993
01:02:58,876 --> 01:03:00,410
You know the one? Oh, my God.

994
01:03:00,444 --> 01:03:02,446
Were the lines very long?

995
01:03:02,479 --> 01:03:04,849
Uh, yeah, yeah, sometimes.

996
01:03:04,882 --> 01:03:06,116
60 minutes and upwards.

997
01:03:06,150 --> 01:03:12,990
Unless, of course,
you got the, um, Fast pass.

998
01:03:13,023 --> 01:03:15,125
What's the Fast pass?

999
01:03:15,159 --> 01:03:17,061
Uh, well, you know,

1000
01:03:17,094 --> 01:03:20,230
you got all these different
kingdoms there and, uh,

1001
01:03:20,264 --> 01:03:22,599
so you take this Fast pass.

1002
01:03:22,632 --> 01:03:24,234
It's kind of a laminated card.

1003
01:03:24,268 --> 01:03:25,970
You just put into a machine

1004
01:03:26,003 --> 01:03:27,838
and it tells you
when to come back

1005
01:03:27,872 --> 01:03:30,107
so, you know, you don't
have to wait in line.

1006
01:03:30,140 --> 01:03:31,976
You just go right in and...

1007
01:03:32,009 --> 01:03:34,544
You guys ever go to Florida?

1008
01:03:34,578 --> 01:03:36,513
No.

1009
01:03:39,116 --> 01:03:42,152
How many grandchildren
do you have now?

1010
01:03:42,186 --> 01:03:43,320
Um...

1011
01:03:43,353 --> 01:03:46,523
( laughs )

1012
01:03:46,556 --> 01:03:50,394
Uh, well, all right, there's
little Charles and Shannon

1013
01:03:50,427 --> 01:03:54,999
um, the three older ones
and the babies.

1014
01:03:55,032 --> 01:03:58,335
( Quietly )
Joe, Jay, Mary, George

1015
01:03:58,368 --> 01:04:01,138
Wendy, Lee... so that's 11.

1016
01:04:02,139 --> 01:04:04,975
Must be wonderful.

1017
01:04:05,009 --> 01:04:06,519
Willis always says
"I guess there's no danger

1018
01:04:06,543 --> 01:04:08,378
of us dying off."

1019
01:04:24,494 --> 01:04:26,496
( Voice breaking )
I'm so sorry, Ruth.

1020
01:04:26,530 --> 01:04:29,533
I just wasn't thinking.

1021
01:04:31,035 --> 01:04:35,139
I wanted to have more, uh,
but we had Frank,

1022
01:04:35,172 --> 01:04:40,210
and... Matt was just
starting his practice.

1023
01:04:42,512 --> 01:04:44,915
So I guess it made sense.

1024
01:04:56,093 --> 01:04:58,595
Little Charles.

1025
01:04:58,628 --> 01:05:00,597
Willis: Only got half
a cord of oak left at home.

1026
01:05:00,630 --> 01:05:03,968
And you know how much that
bastard Daniels charges.

1027
01:05:04,001 --> 01:05:06,103
At least I can stack this
up to the cabin

1028
01:05:06,136 --> 01:05:08,939
have something
to burn this fall.

1029
01:05:15,012 --> 01:05:17,647
Katie: You know,
it's a wonderful product

1030
01:05:17,681 --> 01:05:19,516
and they treat you pretty good.

1031
01:05:19,549 --> 01:05:22,686
On account of selling Mary Kay,
we got the new Subaru.

1032
01:05:22,719 --> 01:05:24,955
Well, the ride up
was very comfortable.

1033
01:05:24,989 --> 01:05:26,123
It's a very nice car.

1034
01:05:26,156 --> 01:05:27,291
Well, it's not really a car.

1035
01:05:27,324 --> 01:05:30,427
It's got four-wheel drive.
It's a little SUV.

1036
01:05:30,460 --> 01:05:33,130
What the hell is
all that "SUV" crap?

1037
01:05:33,163 --> 01:05:35,132
Willis:
"Sports utility vehicle."

1038
01:05:35,165 --> 01:05:36,400
It's a little Jeep.

1039
01:05:36,433 --> 01:05:38,602
SUV?

1040
01:05:38,635 --> 01:05:42,306
( laughing ) ATV and KFC.

1041
01:05:42,339 --> 01:05:45,175
What's with all these...
Uh, these, uh...

1042
01:05:45,209 --> 01:05:46,476
- Acronyms.
- Yeah.

1043
01:05:46,510 --> 01:05:48,612
I guess it's just
too much trouble

1044
01:05:48,645 --> 01:05:51,081
to say what something
is anymore.

1045
01:05:51,115 --> 01:05:52,682
What does PMS stand for?

1046
01:05:52,716 --> 01:05:54,684
All right, I was an Army brat.

1047
01:05:54,718 --> 01:05:57,021
I grew up with Jeeps.

1048
01:05:57,054 --> 01:05:59,123
Willy, he's uncomfortable

1049
01:05:59,156 --> 01:06:02,659
that I know more about one
masculine thing than he does.

1050
01:06:02,692 --> 01:06:04,094
Only one?

1051
01:06:04,128 --> 01:06:05,329
( laughter )

1052
01:06:05,362 --> 01:06:07,131
Thanks, buddy.

1053
01:06:07,164 --> 01:06:09,199
I like this guy.

1054
01:06:18,775 --> 01:06:22,279
You've done a nice job
up here, Katie.

1055
01:06:22,312 --> 01:06:25,182
Don't tell me you made
these curtains.

1056
01:06:25,215 --> 01:06:26,783
Is that antique linen?

1057
01:06:26,816 --> 01:06:28,185
Well, sort of.

1058
01:06:28,218 --> 01:06:30,754
They're pillowcases
from our first house.

1059
01:06:30,787 --> 01:06:35,792
I've saved every knickknack
and whim-wham we ever had,

1060
01:06:35,825 --> 01:06:37,694
you included.

1061
01:06:56,313 --> 01:06:59,383
Willis: Well, our timing is off.

1062
01:06:59,416 --> 01:07:01,318
( Matt chuckles )

1063
01:07:20,104 --> 01:07:21,738
Of course, he don't like working

1064
01:07:21,771 --> 01:07:22,806
in recruitment, anyhows.

1065
01:07:22,839 --> 01:07:25,109
Christ, they got them boys
coming down

1066
01:07:25,142 --> 01:07:26,410
to the office in the mall.

1067
01:07:26,443 --> 01:07:28,212
He gets them half-processed
and they decide

1068
01:07:28,245 --> 01:07:30,447
they want to take
that "delayed entry" thing.

1069
01:07:30,480 --> 01:07:31,481
Christ, I couldn't do it.

1070
01:07:31,515 --> 01:07:33,783
Katie: Or they decide
not to join up at all.

1071
01:07:33,817 --> 01:07:36,120
Willis: Like that one kid.

1072
01:07:36,153 --> 01:07:39,456
He had him all the way
through the works and, Christ.

1073
01:07:39,489 --> 01:07:43,393
Yeah the boy's folks
called, uh, called David

1074
01:07:43,427 --> 01:07:46,563
and said that the boy was...
He wanted out so bad

1075
01:07:46,596 --> 01:07:50,134
that he... well,
he'd taken his own life.

1076
01:07:50,167 --> 01:07:52,836
Something like that gets to you.

1077
01:07:52,869 --> 01:07:54,271
Christ, I couldn't do it.

1078
01:08:11,255 --> 01:08:12,856
I'm going now.

1079
01:08:12,889 --> 01:08:15,259
Okay.

1080
01:08:16,926 --> 01:08:21,131
Are you looking forward
to going back?

1081
01:08:21,165 --> 01:08:24,168
Mm-hmm.

1082
01:08:24,201 --> 01:08:26,203
You look nice.

1083
01:08:49,659 --> 01:08:50,894
( Chuckles )

1084
01:08:56,633 --> 01:09:00,170
( laughing )

1085
01:09:00,204 --> 01:09:03,207
( Woman singing )

1086
01:09:03,240 --> 01:09:05,809
( Choir singing
Balkan folk song )

1087
01:09:55,959 --> 01:09:57,026
( Singing stops )

1088
01:09:57,060 --> 01:10:00,797
That was very good.
I goofed up a little bit, but...

1089
01:10:31,661 --> 01:10:33,363
- Ruth.
- ( gasps )

1090
01:10:36,433 --> 01:10:37,934
It comes in waves.

1091
01:10:40,370 --> 01:10:43,640
And then nothing

1092
01:10:43,673 --> 01:10:46,910
like a rest in music.

1093
01:10:46,943 --> 01:10:49,579
No sound, but so loud.

1094
01:10:54,551 --> 01:10:55,819
I don't know what to do.

1095
01:10:55,852 --> 01:10:59,456
I... I feel so angry.

1096
01:11:02,426 --> 01:11:05,495
Louise McVey

1097
01:11:05,529 --> 01:11:08,632
lost a child a few years back.

1098
01:11:08,665 --> 01:11:11,535
Maybe you remember.

1099
01:11:11,568 --> 01:11:13,503
She had four.

1100
01:11:13,537 --> 01:11:14,904
It was the youngest, wasn't it?

1101
01:11:14,938 --> 01:11:17,474
Yes.

1102
01:11:17,507 --> 01:11:20,844
She told me about
a vision she had

1103
01:11:20,877 --> 01:11:24,481
when she found out
her daughter had died.

1104
01:11:24,514 --> 01:11:28,552
She saw herself at a great
distance from the Earth

1105
01:11:28,585 --> 01:11:32,389
and encircling it,
an endless line.

1106
01:11:32,422 --> 01:11:34,624
As she got closer

1107
01:11:34,658 --> 01:11:38,528
she saw that it was made up
of mothers

1108
01:11:38,562 --> 01:11:41,431
traveling forward.

1109
01:11:41,465 --> 01:11:45,335
She fell into line
and began walking with them.

1110
01:11:45,369 --> 01:11:47,771
When they reached
a certain point

1111
01:11:47,804 --> 01:11:52,041
the line divided,
and she said she knew

1112
01:11:52,075 --> 01:11:57,381
that all the millions
of women on her side

1113
01:11:57,414 --> 01:12:01,385
were the mothers
who had lost children.

1114
01:12:10,126 --> 01:12:13,797
She seemed to find
great comfort in that.

1115
01:12:18,568 --> 01:12:20,604
How did the little girl die?

1116
01:12:20,637 --> 01:12:23,840
A drowning, some kind
of swimming accident.

1117
01:12:25,542 --> 01:12:26,643
Oh.

1118
01:12:38,087 --> 01:12:41,124
The name of the game
is Texas chase 'em.

1119
01:12:41,157 --> 01:12:42,892
Henry: Oh, geez.

1120
01:12:42,926 --> 01:12:43,893
Is there a problem?

1121
01:12:43,927 --> 01:12:45,962
Why do you always delude
yourself with that crap?

1122
01:12:45,995 --> 01:12:48,932
- What are you talking about?
- Look, we're not in Vegas.

1123
01:12:48,965 --> 01:12:51,535
It's five-card draw
or seven-card stud.

1124
01:12:51,568 --> 01:12:55,038
That's what I said...
Five-card draw, jacks to open.

1125
01:12:55,071 --> 01:12:58,575
- Carl?
- Asshole.

1126
01:12:58,608 --> 01:13:01,044
I'll bet a buck.

1127
01:13:01,077 --> 01:13:02,679
Raise a buck.

1128
01:13:10,720 --> 01:13:12,489
( Sighs )

1129
01:13:24,167 --> 01:13:27,904
Say something, for Christ sake.

1130
01:13:27,937 --> 01:13:30,173
Quit pussyfooting around me.

1131
01:13:32,976 --> 01:13:36,079
You want me to stare
at these cards all night?

1132
01:13:52,629 --> 01:13:55,499
There are things
of which I may not speak.

1133
01:13:58,535 --> 01:14:00,570
There are dreams
that cannot die.

1134
01:14:03,006 --> 01:14:08,512
There are thoughts
that make the strong heart weak

1135
01:14:08,545 --> 01:14:11,214
and bring a pallor
into the cheek

1136
01:14:11,247 --> 01:14:14,584
and a mist before the eye.

1137
01:14:17,621 --> 01:14:21,157
And the words of that fatal song

1138
01:14:21,190 --> 01:14:23,693
come over me like a chill

1139
01:14:27,030 --> 01:14:30,066
"a boy's will

1140
01:14:30,099 --> 01:14:33,570
is the wind's will.

1141
01:14:33,603 --> 01:14:36,039
And the thoughts of youth.

1142
01:14:36,072 --> 01:14:38,742
Are long, long thoughts."

1143
01:14:48,284 --> 01:14:50,820
Okay, you got the two.

1144
01:14:50,854 --> 01:14:52,689
Willis: I'm in there.

1145
01:14:52,722 --> 01:14:53,890
I'll take one.

1146
01:14:53,923 --> 01:14:55,525
Willis: Okay, you got it.

1147
01:14:55,559 --> 01:14:58,995
I'm going to need...
Oh, I need them all... three.

1148
01:14:59,028 --> 01:15:01,865
Make them good.

1149
01:16:12,736 --> 01:16:15,171
( Couple talking indistinctly )

1150
01:16:31,020 --> 01:16:32,355
( Car door shuts )

1151
01:16:53,409 --> 01:16:55,611
( Metal clinks )

1152
01:16:57,781 --> 01:17:00,049
Matt?

1153
01:17:00,083 --> 01:17:01,685
( Metal clinks )

1154
01:17:54,137 --> 01:17:55,404
Ah!

1155
01:19:19,055 --> 01:19:21,457
Sportscaster on radio:
Atlanta 1, Red Sox nothing.

1156
01:19:21,490 --> 01:19:24,260
From the stretch, Martinez.

1157
01:19:24,293 --> 01:19:27,396
Still one and two on Jordan.
He's hit 13 home runs.

1158
01:19:27,430 --> 01:19:30,033
He's got a teammate at third
with two down.

1159
01:19:30,066 --> 01:19:33,536
Ramon Martinez gets the sign,
checks the runner at third.

1160
01:19:33,569 --> 01:19:35,471
Comes to the belt
and to the plate.

1161
01:19:35,504 --> 01:19:38,842
A swing and a bouncer
up the middle.

1162
01:19:38,875 --> 01:19:40,552
Nomar fields it,
gloves it, throws to first.

1163
01:19:40,576 --> 01:19:41,945
Inning over.

1164
01:19:41,978 --> 01:19:44,347
They leave a man
in scoring position.

1165
01:19:44,380 --> 01:19:46,315
Jordan's out... six to three.

1166
01:19:46,349 --> 01:19:49,385
Good effort in that inning
by Ramon Martinez

1167
01:19:49,418 --> 01:19:50,686
against a tough hitter.

1168
01:19:50,719 --> 01:19:54,958
After two and a half innings,
Atlanta one, Red Sox nothing

1169
01:19:54,991 --> 01:19:57,260
on the WEEI
Red Sox radio network.

1170
01:19:57,293 --> 01:20:01,564
No. I'm sorry,
that's totally unacceptable.

1171
01:20:01,597 --> 01:20:03,466
Yeah, so what did he say?

1172
01:20:05,568 --> 01:20:08,137
He... no, we can't allow that.

1173
01:20:08,171 --> 01:20:09,405
Hold it a sec.

1174
01:20:09,438 --> 01:20:10,840
Excuse me, Matt.

1175
01:20:10,874 --> 01:20:12,308
Ryan Collit's out there.

1176
01:20:12,341 --> 01:20:14,210
His mother just brought him in.

1177
01:20:14,243 --> 01:20:16,579
I'll, uh, I'll call
you back later, okay?

1178
01:20:16,612 --> 01:20:18,882
Yeah. Yeah, okay.

1179
01:20:21,017 --> 01:20:22,385
I'll be back at 4:00, Janelle.

1180
01:20:24,988 --> 01:20:26,923
Okay.

1181
01:20:26,956 --> 01:20:29,558
I'm sorry, Dr. Fowler,
but you just missed him.

1182
01:20:29,592 --> 01:20:31,194
Thank you.

1183
01:20:31,227 --> 01:20:34,330
No, I really need to see him.
He go to lunch?

1184
01:20:34,363 --> 01:20:36,232
That's right.

1185
01:20:41,637 --> 01:20:44,007
He's across the street.

1186
01:20:44,040 --> 01:20:45,574
Thank you.

1187
01:21:12,535 --> 01:21:16,539
That's what they do, you know?

1188
01:21:16,572 --> 01:21:17,941
Oh, hey, Matt.

1189
01:21:17,974 --> 01:21:21,544
Hi.

1190
01:21:21,577 --> 01:21:22,946
Have a seat.

1191
01:21:22,979 --> 01:21:24,347
Thank you. Thank you.

1192
01:21:24,380 --> 01:21:27,951
- This is my assistant, Jack.
- Oh, hi, Jack.

1193
01:21:27,984 --> 01:21:29,652
- Don.
- Hi, Don.

1194
01:21:29,685 --> 01:21:31,955
This is Ed. That's Matt Fowler.

1195
01:21:31,988 --> 01:21:34,057
So how's everything going?

1196
01:21:34,090 --> 01:21:38,427
Oh, uh, it's...
It's okay, you know.

1197
01:21:38,461 --> 01:21:42,598
I just wanted to go over
a couple of things, and,

1198
01:21:42,631 --> 01:21:46,102
you know, when... when
you've had your lunch.

1199
01:21:46,135 --> 01:21:47,570
Sure.

1200
01:21:47,603 --> 01:21:51,407
We really are doing
everything we can, Matt.

1201
01:21:51,440 --> 01:21:53,409
- I promise you that.
- Yeah. What can I do, Bill?

1202
01:21:53,442 --> 01:21:55,278
There's nothing, really.

1203
01:21:55,311 --> 01:21:58,381
Look, it can't be manslaughter.
There's got to be something.

1204
01:21:58,414 --> 01:22:00,216
Can't you find something,
you know,

1205
01:22:00,249 --> 01:22:02,118
like... like some piece
of evidence?

1206
01:22:02,151 --> 01:22:04,520
I mean, that happens.
Doesn't that happen?

1207
01:22:04,553 --> 01:22:06,255
We really are doing
everything we can.

1208
01:22:06,289 --> 01:22:10,093
I'm not going to lie to you...
All we've got is Strout.

1209
01:22:10,126 --> 01:22:11,560
He claims that
there was a struggle.

1210
01:22:11,594 --> 01:22:14,030
Forensics can't determine if
there was a struggle because

1211
01:22:14,063 --> 01:22:17,566
of the condition of the house
when Frank got there.

1212
01:22:17,600 --> 01:22:21,070
The best thing for you to do
is just sit tight.

1213
01:22:21,104 --> 01:22:23,339
Now, we haven't thrown
in the towel yet

1214
01:22:23,372 --> 01:22:24,673
and you shouldn't either.

1215
01:22:24,707 --> 01:22:26,475
We've still got two
investigators

1216
01:22:26,509 --> 01:22:27,543
working on this case.

1217
01:22:27,576 --> 01:22:30,446
( Voice fading ) It's still
a priority case for us.

1218
01:22:30,479 --> 01:22:32,381
We've got leads we're
following up on...

1219
01:22:32,415 --> 01:22:34,317
( coins jingling loudly )

1220
01:22:34,350 --> 01:22:37,053
Before we wrap this up,
but we're doing the best we can

1221
01:22:37,086 --> 01:22:39,155
with the resources that we have.

1222
01:22:39,188 --> 01:22:41,991
You've just got to hang
in there with us.

1223
01:22:42,025 --> 01:22:44,293
You have to have
some confidence.

1224
01:22:44,327 --> 01:22:47,496
( Jingling continues )

1225
01:22:47,530 --> 01:22:50,233
( Alarm blares )

1226
01:23:01,610 --> 01:23:03,112
( Engine starts )

1227
01:23:04,747 --> 01:23:07,483
Man: He takes these bats and
nails them right on the wall

1228
01:23:07,516 --> 01:23:10,353
above the scale because he
knows big mouth's gonna come

1229
01:23:10,386 --> 01:23:12,488
in there and weigh his catch
eventually, you know?

1230
01:23:12,521 --> 01:23:14,266
He's putting the bats up,
one of the old-timers says.

1231
01:23:14,290 --> 01:23:16,425
"Hey, Ivan, what
the hell are you doing?"

1232
01:23:16,459 --> 01:23:18,061
The old man says,
"Sending a message,"

1233
01:23:18,094 --> 01:23:19,438
and turns around
and walks out the door, right?

1234
01:23:19,462 --> 01:23:21,764
Now, I walk in,
there's these damn baseball bats

1235
01:23:21,797 --> 01:23:24,533
up on the wall, right,
with a big, huge note written

1236
01:23:24,567 --> 01:23:28,204
right across the front of
them. ( Laughs ) - What'd it say?

1237
01:23:28,237 --> 01:23:30,573
"Here's the bats,
if you got the balls."

1238
01:23:30,606 --> 01:23:32,475
( Both laughing )

1239
01:23:36,279 --> 01:23:38,281
He never messed
with our traps again.

1240
01:23:38,314 --> 01:23:39,615
Hey, Dr. Fowler.

1241
01:23:39,648 --> 01:23:43,352
Oh, hi, Tim.

1242
01:23:43,386 --> 01:23:46,322
Did he ever, uh

1243
01:23:46,355 --> 01:23:50,526
did he ever talk to you
about what happened on that day?

1244
01:23:50,559 --> 01:23:53,429
No. No.

1245
01:23:53,462 --> 01:23:55,231
I don't even see
Richard anymore.

1246
01:23:55,264 --> 01:23:57,400
And he'd never tell me
anything anyway.

1247
01:23:57,433 --> 01:23:58,567
Believe me.

1248
01:23:58,601 --> 01:24:01,270
Oh, sure, sure. Of course not.

1249
01:24:01,304 --> 01:24:03,506
I was just wondering if...
If, uh, you know

1250
01:24:03,539 --> 01:24:06,575
maybe you heard something
through the grapevine.

1251
01:24:06,609 --> 01:24:09,645
Maybe, uh, maybe one
of his buddies said something?

1252
01:24:12,415 --> 01:24:13,482
No.

1253
01:24:13,516 --> 01:24:16,585
I was thinking...

1254
01:24:16,619 --> 01:24:18,321
His brothers still work
with you, right?

1255
01:24:18,354 --> 01:24:21,124
They must talk.

1256
01:24:24,327 --> 01:24:27,430
What I'm saying is,
if we could find something...

1257
01:24:27,463 --> 01:24:29,098
Just something concrete.

1258
01:24:29,132 --> 01:24:30,599
If you could...

1259
01:24:30,633 --> 01:24:34,637
It could be just, you know,
a slip of the tongue.

1260
01:24:41,210 --> 01:24:43,546
I'll keep my ears open.

1261
01:24:46,849 --> 01:24:49,752
Thank you.

1262
01:24:49,785 --> 01:24:56,492
It's funny running into
you here, Dr. Fowler.

1263
01:24:56,525 --> 01:24:58,227
Yeah, well...

1264
01:25:01,530 --> 01:25:04,533
( music playing indistinctly
through headphones )

1265
01:25:22,585 --> 01:25:24,920
( Click, music stops )

1266
01:25:24,953 --> 01:25:29,758
Oh, I was hoping we could talk.

1267
01:25:29,792 --> 01:25:32,161
I

1268
01:25:32,195 --> 01:25:38,901
I wanted to tell you
how truly sorry I am.

1269
01:25:38,934 --> 01:25:41,437
And

1270
01:25:41,470 --> 01:25:46,575
if there's anything
that I can ever

1271
01:25:46,609 --> 01:25:49,212
do to... to

1272
01:25:51,347 --> 01:25:53,549
talk with you...

1273
01:25:56,719 --> 01:25:58,287
Oh!

1274
01:26:11,400 --> 01:26:13,469
( Music playing indistinctly
through headphones )

1275
01:26:24,880 --> 01:26:26,615
( Men laugh )

1276
01:26:26,649 --> 01:26:28,817
Man, better get back
to the grind

1277
01:26:28,851 --> 01:26:30,519
and don't steal anything.

1278
01:26:30,553 --> 01:26:32,688
Hello, Mrs. Fowler.

1279
01:26:37,893 --> 01:26:39,495
Will there be anything else?

1280
01:26:39,528 --> 01:26:41,564
I want a pack
of Marlboro Lights.

1281
01:26:41,597 --> 01:26:43,266
Sure.

1282
01:26:48,804 --> 01:26:53,576
That will be, uh, $14.95
with the cigarettes.

1283
01:27:00,549 --> 01:27:01,650
Thank you.

1284
01:27:12,561 --> 01:27:14,597
Matt: How did it go today?

1285
01:27:29,945 --> 01:27:31,614
Something wrong?

1286
01:27:31,647 --> 01:27:32,981
Wrong?

1287
01:27:33,015 --> 01:27:34,783
What could be wrong, Matt?

1288
01:27:55,704 --> 01:27:57,406
What do you want?

1289
01:27:57,440 --> 01:27:59,608
I want to know what's going on.

1290
01:27:59,642 --> 01:28:01,777
Oh, right.

1291
01:28:01,810 --> 01:28:03,679
You're obviously upset.

1292
01:28:03,712 --> 01:28:05,848
Is there something
we can talk about?

1293
01:28:05,881 --> 01:28:09,918
Talk? Who, us?

1294
01:28:09,952 --> 01:28:13,456
What if somebody walked in?
They wouldn't recognize us.

1295
01:28:13,489 --> 01:28:16,592
They'd think they were
in the wrong house.

1296
01:28:16,625 --> 01:28:18,827
Do you want to talk or not?

1297
01:28:18,861 --> 01:28:22,565
Oh, you mean about
our dead son? No.

1298
01:28:22,598 --> 01:28:24,567
We haven't before.

1299
01:28:24,600 --> 01:28:27,703
Why should we bother now?

1300
01:28:27,736 --> 01:28:30,072
What can I do, Ruth?

1301
01:28:30,105 --> 01:28:32,408
Forget it, Matt.

1302
01:28:32,441 --> 01:28:34,677
Why don't you just go?

1303
01:28:34,710 --> 01:28:37,580
What do you want from me?

1304
01:28:37,613 --> 01:28:41,750
I want you to stop acting
like nothing's happened.

1305
01:28:41,784 --> 01:28:43,386
That's what I want.

1306
01:28:43,419 --> 01:28:46,889
Why, because I'm not
bouncing off the walls?

1307
01:28:46,922 --> 01:28:49,458
No, Matt,
that would require feelings.

1308
01:28:49,492 --> 01:28:51,594
We don't want you
to hurt yourself.

1309
01:28:51,627 --> 01:28:52,928
Do me a favor, Ruth.

1310
01:28:52,961 --> 01:28:56,331
You want a grieving contest,
go find someone else.

1311
01:28:58,534 --> 01:29:00,503
Oh, I know how you grieve.

1312
01:29:00,536 --> 01:29:01,904
Go have another beer.

1313
01:29:04,540 --> 01:29:07,676
What the hell is
that supposed to mean?

1314
01:29:07,710 --> 01:29:09,545
What do you know?

1315
01:29:09,578 --> 01:29:10,713
You know nothing.

1316
01:29:10,746 --> 01:29:13,716
You don't you don't know
what I go through.

1317
01:29:13,749 --> 01:29:16,919
No, I don't know
what you go through, Matt

1318
01:29:16,952 --> 01:29:19,388
or if you go through anything.

1319
01:29:19,422 --> 01:29:22,858
But that's your choice,
dear, not mine.

1320
01:29:22,891 --> 01:29:24,627
You're goddamn right it is.

1321
01:29:24,660 --> 01:29:26,662
My choice is not to
scream at the world.

1322
01:29:26,695 --> 01:29:29,598
Maybe one of us has to be
reasonable around here.

1323
01:29:29,632 --> 01:29:32,601
- You ever think of that?
- Reasonable?

1324
01:29:32,635 --> 01:29:34,603
Gee, Matt

1325
01:29:34,637 --> 01:29:38,607
I don't know about you,
but I miss my son.

1326
01:29:38,641 --> 01:29:40,609
I'm glad you have time
for reason.

1327
01:29:40,643 --> 01:29:43,979
That's what you imparted
to Frank, that sense of reason.

1328
01:29:44,012 --> 01:29:45,514
( Dish clatters )

1329
01:29:45,548 --> 01:29:50,118
Oh, he thought you were
very reasonable.

1330
01:29:50,152 --> 01:29:52,688
What are you talking about?

1331
01:29:55,824 --> 01:29:57,092
Nothing.

1332
01:30:02,765 --> 01:30:06,502
Are you... are you saying that...

1333
01:30:06,535 --> 01:30:10,005
That I'm the one responsible?

1334
01:30:12,541 --> 01:30:13,642
Is that it?

1335
01:30:13,676 --> 01:30:15,844
Well, uh

1336
01:30:15,878 --> 01:30:17,646
well, let me tell you something.

1337
01:30:17,680 --> 01:30:18,814
Let me tell you something.

1338
01:30:18,847 --> 01:30:21,917
- You got it backwards.
- ( water stops running )

1339
01:30:21,950 --> 01:30:24,620
I know what you think...
That... that I was too lenient.

1340
01:30:24,653 --> 01:30:26,655
That I let him get away with...

1341
01:30:26,689 --> 01:30:28,591
Everything! Everything!

1342
01:30:28,624 --> 01:30:31,126
Yes, yes, yes, and why?
Why did he ever come to you?

1343
01:30:31,159 --> 01:30:35,664
- He wouldn't listen to me!
- No, he wouldn't listen to you...

1344
01:30:35,698 --> 01:30:38,200
He wouldn't listen to you
because you never listened to him.

1345
01:30:38,233 --> 01:30:39,602
No, but you did.

1346
01:30:39,635 --> 01:30:41,670
You were winking at him
the whole time.

1347
01:30:41,704 --> 01:30:43,706
You encouraged him.

1348
01:30:43,739 --> 01:30:45,708
You wanted what he had... her.

1349
01:30:45,741 --> 01:30:48,611
Oh, my God,
you've got to be kidding!

1350
01:30:48,644 --> 01:30:49,444
Come on, you know it!

1351
01:30:49,478 --> 01:30:51,780
You wanted it
and you couldn't get it.

1352
01:30:51,814 --> 01:30:53,682
That's why you didn't stop him...

1353
01:30:53,716 --> 01:30:56,552
So you could get
your kicks through your son.

1354
01:30:56,585 --> 01:30:59,254
You can't admit the truth
to me or to yourself

1355
01:30:59,287 --> 01:31:02,525
that Frank died for your
fantasy piece of ass!

1356
01:31:02,558 --> 01:31:06,194
Oh, you know

1357
01:31:06,228 --> 01:31:08,864
y-you want to know
why our son is dead?

1358
01:31:08,897 --> 01:31:10,699
You really want to know?

1359
01:31:10,733 --> 01:31:14,503
He was with her not
because of me.

1360
01:31:14,537 --> 01:31:16,672
He went there because of you.

1361
01:31:16,705 --> 01:31:21,076
Yes, he did because
you are so controlling,

1362
01:31:21,109 --> 01:31:24,913
so overbearing,

1363
01:31:24,947 --> 01:31:27,850
so angry that he was it.

1364
01:31:27,883 --> 01:31:30,152
That he was our only one.

1365
01:31:30,185 --> 01:31:31,720
That is not true.

1366
01:31:31,754 --> 01:31:33,589
Oh, yes, it is. Yes, it is.

1367
01:31:33,622 --> 01:31:35,791
Even when he was a kid
you were telling him how...

1368
01:31:35,824 --> 01:31:37,993
How he was always wrong.

1369
01:31:38,026 --> 01:31:40,596
Oh, I remember

1370
01:31:40,629 --> 01:31:43,999
one time you yanked him
out of a Little League game

1371
01:31:44,032 --> 01:31:45,901
and sent him home

1372
01:31:45,934 --> 01:31:49,738
for throwing his...
His glove in the dirt.

1373
01:31:49,772 --> 01:31:53,576
He was what? Nine years old?

1374
01:32:02,985 --> 01:32:06,388
Everything he did was wrong.

1375
01:32:10,258 --> 01:32:13,762
Well, what was wrong
with him, Ruth?

1376
01:32:21,269 --> 01:32:27,576
You're... you're so unforgiving.

1377
01:32:27,610 --> 01:32:29,044
You are.

1378
01:32:29,077 --> 01:32:30,879
That's what he said.

1379
01:32:36,652 --> 01:32:39,154
And you're pulling
the same shit with me

1380
01:32:39,187 --> 01:32:41,256
and that's a horrible way to be.

1381
01:32:41,289 --> 01:32:44,760
It's horrible.

1382
01:32:44,793 --> 01:32:46,662
You're bitter, Ruth.

1383
01:32:46,695 --> 01:32:50,999
And you can point your finger
at me all you like

1384
01:32:51,033 --> 01:32:54,703
but you better take
a damn good look at yourself.

1385
01:33:05,013 --> 01:33:08,651
I just wanted to talk
about what happened, Matt.

1386
01:33:10,686 --> 01:33:12,688
( Chuckles )

1387
01:33:12,721 --> 01:33:16,291
You want me to be open with you,
embrace you?

1388
01:33:16,324 --> 01:33:18,661
You scare me.

1389
01:33:18,694 --> 01:33:21,263
How can I talk to you?

1390
01:33:21,296 --> 01:33:22,765
Sometimes I...

1391
01:33:22,798 --> 01:33:24,833
Sometimes I can't
even look at you.

1392
01:33:31,740 --> 01:33:33,876
( Tapping on door )

1393
01:33:33,909 --> 01:33:36,845
Oh, God.

1394
01:33:36,879 --> 01:33:39,682
( Tapping continues )

1395
01:33:39,715 --> 01:33:41,183
( Sighs )

1396
01:33:41,216 --> 01:33:43,986
That's probably the police.

1397
01:33:49,224 --> 01:33:51,026
Hi, there, I'm Kristen Gellar

1398
01:33:51,059 --> 01:33:53,395
from the Rockland
Gymnastics Association

1399
01:33:53,428 --> 01:33:56,231
and today we're selling
brand-name candy.

1400
01:33:56,264 --> 01:33:59,301
Each purchase is matched
by the Tandy Corporation

1401
01:33:59,334 --> 01:34:02,170
to help us meet our goal
of traveling to Oahu

1402
01:34:02,204 --> 01:34:04,406
to compete in the east/west
conference.

1403
01:34:04,439 --> 01:34:07,375
Uh, okay, I'll,
uh I'll take some.

1404
01:34:07,409 --> 01:34:10,012
Oh, and today we have a special.

1405
01:34:10,045 --> 01:34:11,680
Six bars for $10.

1406
01:34:11,714 --> 01:34:14,683
Okay, I'll, uh... I'll do that.

1407
01:34:18,887 --> 01:34:20,899
- Should I hold something?
- Yeah. Could you hold this?

1408
01:34:20,923 --> 01:34:22,758
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

1409
01:34:25,460 --> 01:34:27,863
Okay, there's... there's the 10.

1410
01:34:27,896 --> 01:34:29,197
Thank you.

1411
01:34:29,231 --> 01:34:30,999
Here.

1412
01:34:31,033 --> 01:34:32,434
You can pick anything you want.

1413
01:34:32,467 --> 01:34:33,902
Any six is... okay.

1414
01:34:43,812 --> 01:34:45,714
Ruth.

1415
01:34:50,819 --> 01:34:52,454
What I said just now...

1416
01:34:54,522 --> 01:34:56,992
I, uh

1417
01:34:57,025 --> 01:34:59,027
I had no right.

1418
01:35:01,496 --> 01:35:04,432
No one

1419
01:35:04,466 --> 01:35:07,936
no one should ever have
to hear stuff like that.

1420
01:35:11,506 --> 01:35:13,341
I'm so sorry.

1421
01:35:21,516 --> 01:35:22,751
It's okay.

1422
01:35:22,785 --> 01:35:27,923
No. You're right, Matt.

1423
01:35:27,956 --> 01:35:30,492
I am horrible.

1424
01:35:32,027 --> 01:35:34,763
Please, please, please don't.

1425
01:35:39,501 --> 01:35:41,503
I don't blame you.

1426
01:35:44,472 --> 01:35:47,275
It's just

1427
01:35:47,309 --> 01:35:49,444
that girl came by the school.

1428
01:35:53,882 --> 01:35:55,450
And I couldn't forgive her.

1429
01:35:57,485 --> 01:36:00,022
And I was

1430
01:36:00,055 --> 01:36:01,857
I was so.

1431
01:36:09,431 --> 01:36:11,299
I'm sorry.

1432
01:36:11,333 --> 01:36:14,469
I've been so

1433
01:36:14,502 --> 01:36:17,372
I've been so angry.

1434
01:36:17,405 --> 01:36:19,007
That's okay.

1435
01:36:21,910 --> 01:36:23,045
It's just.

1436
01:36:26,481 --> 01:36:29,918
I've seen him,
and I keep seeing him.

1437
01:36:29,952 --> 01:36:32,187
I know. I... I know.

1438
01:36:32,220 --> 01:36:34,389
In his room, you know,

1439
01:36:34,422 --> 01:36:37,492
sometimes I can swear
he's there.

1440
01:36:37,525 --> 01:36:41,864
And, uh, today, at a stoplight,
I could've sworn Frank...

1441
01:36:41,897 --> 01:36:44,232
Not Frank.

1442
01:36:44,266 --> 01:36:47,502
Richard.

1443
01:36:47,535 --> 01:36:50,038
( Sobbing )
And I don't know what to do.

1444
01:36:58,947 --> 01:37:01,583
Ruth, Ruth, Ruth.

1445
01:37:01,616 --> 01:37:04,452
Uh.

1446
01:37:04,486 --> 01:37:06,421
Where... where did you see him?

1447
01:37:06,454 --> 01:37:08,924
Everywhere. Downtown.
At the market.

1448
01:37:08,957 --> 01:37:12,460
I saw him...
I saw him at South End.

1449
01:37:12,494 --> 01:37:15,197
He smiled at me, Matt.

1450
01:37:18,366 --> 01:37:21,937
I keep running into him.

1451
01:37:21,970 --> 01:37:23,505
He smiled.

1452
01:37:25,573 --> 01:37:27,209
( Crying )

1453
01:37:27,242 --> 01:37:30,879
Oh, it's okay.

1454
01:37:30,913 --> 01:37:32,614
It's okay, it's okay.

1455
01:38:16,024 --> 01:38:18,526
Katie: Honey,
are you coming to bed now?

1456
01:38:18,560 --> 01:38:20,328
Soon, baby. Matt's still here.

1457
01:38:20,362 --> 01:38:23,131
Oh. Well well, hi, Matt.

1458
01:38:23,165 --> 01:38:24,566
Uh, honey, when you come to bed,

1459
01:38:24,599 --> 01:38:26,568
would you bring me my pills?

1460
01:38:26,601 --> 01:38:28,703
Um, they're on the, um,
top shelf

1461
01:38:28,736 --> 01:38:30,572
from when the kids were here.

1462
01:38:30,605 --> 01:38:32,474
- All right.
- All right, thanks, dear.

1463
01:38:35,978 --> 01:38:39,414
Matt: I never thought
about bail.

1464
01:38:39,447 --> 01:38:43,385
I thought I wouldn't have
to worry about him for years.

1465
01:38:43,418 --> 01:38:45,420
You know what I heard?

1466
01:38:45,453 --> 01:38:48,523
He's tending bar up
to Old Orchard Beach

1467
01:38:48,556 --> 01:38:50,558
for a friend.

1468
01:38:50,592 --> 01:38:53,528
You ever notice even the
worst bastards have friends?

1469
01:38:53,561 --> 01:38:56,098
Well, nobody knows
him over there.

1470
01:38:56,131 --> 01:38:59,167
If they do, they don't care.
They drink what he mixes.

1471
01:39:03,171 --> 01:39:05,040
I hate him, Matt.

1472
01:39:05,073 --> 01:39:07,642
My boys went to school with him.
He was the same then.

1473
01:39:07,675 --> 01:39:11,379
You know what he'll do?
Five years at the most.

1474
01:39:11,413 --> 01:39:13,148
Yeah, I know.

1475
01:39:13,181 --> 01:39:15,717
Remember that woman
about seven years ago?

1476
01:39:15,750 --> 01:39:18,987
Shot her husband and dropped him
off the bridge in the St. George

1477
01:39:19,021 --> 01:39:20,488
with a 100-pound sack of cement

1478
01:39:20,522 --> 01:39:22,991
and said the whole way
through it, nobody helped her.

1479
01:39:23,025 --> 01:39:25,327
- You know where she is now?
- Where?

1480
01:39:25,360 --> 01:39:28,363
She's up to Sears port
now, a secretary,

1481
01:39:28,396 --> 01:39:32,467
and whoever helped her,
where the hell is he?

1482
01:39:41,609 --> 01:39:45,313
It'd break my heart,
Matt, it would.

1483
01:39:45,347 --> 01:39:51,486
But you ever think about just

1484
01:39:51,519 --> 01:39:52,754
moving away?

1485
01:39:56,624 --> 01:39:58,193
Yeah, we have.

1486
01:39:59,694 --> 01:40:01,463
It wouldn't matter.

1487
01:40:03,198 --> 01:40:05,533
Yeah.

1488
01:40:06,834 --> 01:40:10,072
( Woman singing slow
Balkan folk song )

1489
01:40:21,583 --> 01:40:24,619
( Women join in singing )

1490
01:41:48,436 --> 01:41:51,573
Let me lock the place up.
I'll walk you to your car.

1491
01:41:51,606 --> 01:41:53,408
Good night, Richard.
I'll see you tomorrow.

1492
01:41:53,441 --> 01:41:55,510
Wait up. Come on, you want
to come over for a drink?

1493
01:41:55,543 --> 01:41:56,644
No, thanks.

1494
01:41:56,678 --> 01:41:58,546
- Come on!
- Maybe some other night.

1495
01:41:58,580 --> 01:42:00,182
Just one drink?

1496
01:42:00,215 --> 01:42:01,183
( Engine starts )

1497
01:42:01,216 --> 01:42:03,751
Come on!

1498
01:42:03,785 --> 01:42:05,487
All right.

1499
01:42:06,854 --> 01:42:08,523
Fucking bitch.

1500
01:42:24,606 --> 01:42:26,441
What are you doing here?

1501
01:42:31,913 --> 01:42:35,517
Anything I can... help you with?

1502
01:42:47,662 --> 01:42:48,663
Don't talk.

1503
01:42:48,696 --> 01:42:49,831
Oh, God.

1504
01:42:49,864 --> 01:42:52,667
Unlock the door and get in.

1505
01:42:52,700 --> 01:42:55,637
Wait just a minute.
Let's calm down.

1506
01:42:55,670 --> 01:42:56,638
Let's calm...

1507
01:42:56,671 --> 01:43:00,342
All right, all right, all right.

1508
01:43:00,375 --> 01:43:01,676
All right.

1509
01:43:10,918 --> 01:43:14,322
( Whispering )
All right, all right.

1510
01:43:14,356 --> 01:43:16,224
All right.

1511
01:43:24,599 --> 01:43:26,668
Unlock it.

1512
01:43:35,877 --> 01:43:36,978
( Exhales deeply )

1513
01:43:37,011 --> 01:43:40,248
Is there anyone at your place?

1514
01:43:40,282 --> 01:43:41,516
Not tonight.

1515
01:43:41,549 --> 01:43:42,784
Good.

1516
01:43:42,817 --> 01:43:44,619
Drive there.

1517
01:43:44,652 --> 01:43:46,954
Drive slowly.

1518
01:43:46,988 --> 01:43:49,324
Don't try to get stopped.

1519
01:43:49,357 --> 01:43:50,558
All right.

1520
01:44:19,687 --> 01:44:21,956
He was making it with
my wife, Dr. Fowler.

1521
01:44:31,599 --> 01:44:33,801
Don't talk.

1522
01:45:00,562 --> 01:45:03,398
Let's go to the back door.

1523
01:45:03,431 --> 01:45:05,299
Keep your mouth shut.

1524
01:45:13,775 --> 01:45:15,710
Turn the light on.

1525
01:45:20,948 --> 01:45:22,584
Where's your suitcase?

1526
01:45:22,617 --> 01:45:23,551
My suitcase?

1527
01:45:23,585 --> 01:45:25,086
Yeah. Where is it?

1528
01:45:25,119 --> 01:45:26,988
Uh, in the bedroom closet.

1529
01:45:27,021 --> 01:45:29,424
Okay, that's where we're going.

1530
01:45:29,457 --> 01:45:32,894
When you come to a door,
stop and turn the light on.

1531
01:45:32,927 --> 01:45:34,562
Let's go.

1532
01:45:58,119 --> 01:46:00,955
There's no wall switch.

1533
01:46:00,988 --> 01:46:02,624
Where's the light?

1534
01:46:02,657 --> 01:46:04,526
By the bed.

1535
01:46:04,559 --> 01:46:06,360
Go ahead.

1536
01:46:13,668 --> 01:46:16,671
Sit down on the bed.

1537
01:46:25,680 --> 01:46:27,815
Which closet is it?

1538
01:46:27,849 --> 01:46:30,685
Where are the suitcases?

1539
01:46:46,868 --> 01:46:50,104
I wanted to work things out
with Natalie,

1540
01:46:50,137 --> 01:46:52,674
try to get back together again

1541
01:46:52,707 --> 01:46:56,911
but I couldn't...
I couldn't even talk to her.

1542
01:46:56,944 --> 01:46:59,614
He was always with her.

1543
01:46:59,647 --> 01:47:01,182
Dr. Fowler, it was an accident.

1544
01:47:01,215 --> 01:47:03,017
I'm going to jail to pay for it.

1545
01:47:03,050 --> 01:47:05,453
If I ever get out,
I'll be an old man.

1546
01:47:05,487 --> 01:47:07,121
Isn't that enough?

1547
01:47:07,154 --> 01:47:08,656
You're not going to jail.

1548
01:47:11,526 --> 01:47:13,561
Pack clothes for warm weather.

1549
01:47:19,000 --> 01:47:21,836
Y-you're going to let me go?

1550
01:47:21,869 --> 01:47:24,672
You're going to jump bail.

1551
01:47:24,706 --> 01:47:26,674
What?

1552
01:47:26,708 --> 01:47:28,242
Go ahead.

1553
01:47:28,275 --> 01:47:29,711
Go ahead.

1554
01:47:29,744 --> 01:47:31,613
All right, all right.

1555
01:47:34,849 --> 01:47:37,819
See, it's, uh it's the trial.

1556
01:47:37,852 --> 01:47:40,522
We can't go through that,
my wife and I.

1557
01:47:40,555 --> 01:47:42,924
That's why you're leaving.
I've got you a ticket.

1558
01:47:45,593 --> 01:47:49,196
My wife keeps seeing you.
I can't have that anymore.

1559
01:47:51,866 --> 01:47:53,668
Thank you, Dr. Fowler.

1560
01:48:01,609 --> 01:48:04,612
I'd go pick up my boys,
and he'd be there.

1561
01:48:04,646 --> 01:48:07,582
Sometimes he spent the night.

1562
01:48:07,615 --> 01:48:09,684
Duncan told me.

1563
01:48:09,717 --> 01:48:10,785
I'm sorry, doctor.

1564
01:48:10,818 --> 01:48:12,687
All right, that's enough.

1565
01:48:12,720 --> 01:48:13,788
I, uh

1566
01:48:13,821 --> 01:48:15,990
I need some things
from the bathroom.

1567
01:48:34,642 --> 01:48:35,743
Keep walking.

1568
01:48:35,777 --> 01:48:39,080
I got to pee.

1569
01:48:39,113 --> 01:48:40,682
Go ahead.

1570
01:48:45,319 --> 01:48:47,054
( Foot kicks door)

1571
01:48:48,122 --> 01:48:49,824
( Zipper unzips )

1572
01:48:54,662 --> 01:48:58,766
( Urinating )

1573
01:49:21,155 --> 01:49:22,590
Wait.

1574
01:49:31,198 --> 01:49:33,000
Let's go.

1575
01:49:37,238 --> 01:49:38,339
You know they'll catch me.

1576
01:49:38,372 --> 01:49:40,675
They're going to check
passenger lists.

1577
01:49:40,708 --> 01:49:42,309
I didn't use your name.

1578
01:49:42,343 --> 01:49:43,510
They'll figure that out, too.

1579
01:49:43,544 --> 01:49:47,114
You think I wouldn't have done
it myself if it was that easy?

1580
01:49:47,148 --> 01:49:51,085
You were alone.
We got it worked out.

1581
01:49:51,118 --> 01:49:52,887
Who's we?

1582
01:49:52,920 --> 01:49:55,222
Start the engine. Let's go.

1583
01:50:08,670 --> 01:50:12,039
There's no planes
this time of night, Dr. Fowler.

1584
01:50:12,073 --> 01:50:14,776
Go north on 73.

1585
01:50:16,210 --> 01:50:17,378
The airport's south.

1586
01:50:17,411 --> 01:50:21,883
Someone's going
to keep you a while.

1587
01:50:21,916 --> 01:50:24,018
They'll take you to the airport.

1588
01:50:26,187 --> 01:50:29,223
Turn the radio on.

1589
01:50:29,256 --> 01:50:30,792
Find the game.

1590
01:50:30,825 --> 01:50:32,794
I-it's after 1:00.

1591
01:50:32,827 --> 01:50:35,730
They run it again.

1592
01:50:35,763 --> 01:50:37,699
No more talking.

1593
01:50:37,732 --> 01:50:40,301
( Rock music playing )

1594
01:50:40,334 --> 01:50:42,303
( Dialing stations )

1595
01:50:42,336 --> 01:50:44,338
( Crowd cheering )

1596
01:50:44,371 --> 01:50:48,342
Sportscaster: Let's see,
the last Red Sox player

1597
01:50:48,375 --> 01:50:50,353
to have a three-home-run game
would have been Trot Nixon

1598
01:50:50,377 --> 01:50:51,879
last year at Detroit.

1599
01:50:56,718 --> 01:50:59,053
Nomar had one previous to that.

1600
01:50:59,086 --> 01:51:02,957
Off with a fast ball. Ball one.

1601
01:51:02,990 --> 01:51:05,192
Galarraga holds
against Daubach at first.

1602
01:51:05,226 --> 01:51:08,062
The outfield swung
around to their left.

1603
01:51:08,095 --> 01:51:11,132
And a ground-ball roller
to shortstop.

1604
01:51:11,165 --> 01:51:13,334
Flip to second,
they force Daubach.

1605
01:51:13,367 --> 01:51:16,771
6-4 on the force, Garciaparra.

1606
01:51:16,804 --> 01:51:19,440
Actually hit into a force play
to end the inning.

1607
01:51:19,473 --> 01:51:21,943
6-4 to get Daubach at second.

1608
01:51:21,976 --> 01:51:24,245
The inning is over.
Red Sox have left seven.

1609
01:51:24,278 --> 01:51:27,949
After six, the Red Sox 7,
the Braves 2.

1610
01:51:27,982 --> 01:51:30,718
On the WEEI
Red Sox radio network.

1611
01:52:13,928 --> 01:52:16,864
Hit the scoring run,
there, one for two.

1612
01:52:18,800 --> 01:52:23,037
Six for ten with a home run,
three RBIs in the series.

1613
01:52:25,372 --> 01:52:27,074
Hits one into the air.

1614
01:52:27,108 --> 01:52:29,010
Turn around.

1615
01:52:29,043 --> 01:52:30,177
Why?

1616
01:52:30,211 --> 01:52:32,346
- We missed it! Turn around!
- Okay.

1617
01:52:32,379 --> 01:52:34,348
That's like using a
rolled-up newspaper

1618
01:52:34,381 --> 01:52:36,283
for that hit.

1619
01:52:41,823 --> 01:52:44,025
Sanders is up.
Homered his first time.

1620
01:52:44,058 --> 01:52:47,561
One for two.
His fourth of the year.

1621
01:52:47,594 --> 01:52:49,797
( Sportscaster continues
indistinctly )

1622
01:53:07,314 --> 01:53:10,417
There's nothing back here,
Dr. Fowler.

1623
01:53:10,451 --> 01:53:14,188
I don't understand why we don't
just drive to the airport.

1624
01:53:14,221 --> 01:53:16,290
You don't think
we'd leave your car

1625
01:53:16,323 --> 01:53:18,826
at the airport, do you?

1626
01:53:18,860 --> 01:53:21,195
Knuckleball over the
inside corner for strike two.

1627
01:53:21,228 --> 01:53:23,564
I'll get 20 years, Dr. Fowler.

1628
01:53:23,597 --> 01:53:25,933
I'll be 53 years old.

1629
01:53:28,069 --> 01:53:31,338
That's a year younger
than I am now.

1630
01:53:31,372 --> 01:53:33,007
Here's the pitch.

1631
01:53:33,040 --> 01:53:36,878
Inside. Just missed.
The crowd groans.

1632
01:53:36,911 --> 01:53:39,380
Where are we?

1633
01:53:39,413 --> 01:53:41,248
Almost there.

1634
01:53:49,390 --> 01:53:51,525
Turn it off.
Leave the lights on.

1635
01:53:55,462 --> 01:53:57,865
Is this your cabin, Dr. Fowler?

1636
01:53:57,899 --> 01:54:00,467
No, it isn't.
Let's get the bags.

1637
01:54:09,977 --> 01:54:12,346
( Vehicle door opens )

1638
01:54:20,021 --> 01:54:21,455
Mr. Grinnel.

1639
01:54:21,488 --> 01:54:23,090
I'll get them, son.

1640
01:54:26,994 --> 01:54:28,062
Wait.

1641
01:54:33,300 --> 01:54:35,236
You can take this.

1642
01:54:49,483 --> 01:54:51,352
( Running footsteps )

1643
01:54:51,385 --> 01:54:52,553
Matt!

1644
01:54:55,556 --> 01:54:56,958
Matt!

1645
01:55:00,461 --> 01:55:02,396
What did you do?

1646
01:55:02,429 --> 01:55:04,398
This isn't what we talked about.

1647
01:55:08,102 --> 01:55:09,203
He, um...

1648
01:55:12,506 --> 01:55:14,541
He tried to run.

1649
01:55:17,311 --> 01:55:21,415
We were going to wait
and take him out in the woods.

1650
01:55:27,721 --> 01:55:29,490
I couldn't wait.

1651
01:55:37,198 --> 01:55:39,600
I better get the ATV.

1652
01:56:15,536 --> 01:56:18,539
( Thunder rumbling )

1653
01:56:18,572 --> 01:56:20,474
( Rain falling )

1654
01:56:33,220 --> 01:56:34,321
Wait.

1655
01:56:34,355 --> 01:56:37,424
( Twig snaps )

1656
01:56:55,376 --> 01:56:56,643
Come on. We got to go.

1657
01:57:15,829 --> 01:57:18,332
( Boat approaching )

1658
01:57:43,790 --> 01:57:44,858
( Metallic clanking )

1659
01:57:44,891 --> 01:57:47,094
Come on. Go.

1660
01:58:04,578 --> 01:58:07,714
( Train whistle blows
in distance )

1661
01:58:22,396 --> 01:58:23,630
What time is it?

1662
01:58:26,233 --> 01:58:28,569
It's ten to 4:00.

1663
01:58:28,602 --> 01:58:30,504
We lost an hour.

1664
01:58:30,537 --> 01:58:32,573
I'm sorry.

1665
01:58:32,606 --> 01:58:34,508
Yeah.

1666
01:58:34,541 --> 01:58:36,543
High tide.

1667
01:58:36,577 --> 01:58:39,513
Can't stop people
from fishing, Matt.

1668
01:58:40,614 --> 01:58:41,648
Fucking bridge.

1669
01:58:41,682 --> 01:58:43,484
I'm sorry, Willis.

1670
01:58:49,956 --> 01:58:53,527
Stopped into his
little shed there once.

1671
01:58:53,560 --> 01:58:56,197
Place reeked.

1672
01:58:56,230 --> 01:58:58,832
The guy spilled more whiskey
than we've ever drunk.

1673
01:59:00,767 --> 01:59:03,504
We'll just pray he's already
three sheets to the wind.

1674
01:59:08,942 --> 01:59:11,412
Katie's pill will
be wearing off soon.

1675
02:01:24,077 --> 02:01:26,547
( Quietly ) Okay.

1676
02:01:26,580 --> 02:01:29,750
Okay. Okay.

1677
02:01:50,737 --> 02:01:53,306
All right.

1678
02:02:54,435 --> 02:02:56,537
Did you do it?

1679
02:03:38,679 --> 02:03:40,881
( Whispering )
Are you all right, Matt?

1680
02:03:52,025 --> 02:03:55,962
There was a picture of him
and Natalie on the wall.

1681
02:04:03,737 --> 02:04:06,106
What is it, Matt?

1682
02:04:11,277 --> 02:04:13,880
The way she was smiling.

1683
02:04:17,818 --> 02:04:19,686
What?

1684
02:04:26,059 --> 02:04:28,829
I don't know.

1685
02:04:40,240 --> 02:04:41,508
Matt.

1686
02:05:00,326 --> 02:05:03,597
What am I thinking?

1687
02:05:03,630 --> 02:05:06,567
You must be hungry.

1688
02:05:12,573 --> 02:05:14,575
( Ruth descending stairs )

1689
02:05:29,690 --> 02:05:31,925
Ruth: Matt?

1690
02:05:35,696 --> 02:05:37,564
Matt?

1691
02:05:37,598 --> 02:05:40,066
Do you want coffee?

1692
02:06:02,022 --> 02:06:07,027
( long sigh )

1693
02:06:15,936 --> 02:06:18,571
( Dog barking in distance )
