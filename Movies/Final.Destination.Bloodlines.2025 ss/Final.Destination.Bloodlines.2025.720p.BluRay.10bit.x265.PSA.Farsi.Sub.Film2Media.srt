- What was that?
- Nothing.

2
00:00:46,338 --> 00:00:49,132
- Okay, just give me one little hint.
- No. No hints.

3
00:00:49,967 --> 00:00:50,968
We're almost there.

4
00:00:51,051 --> 00:00:52,177
Okay, I'm going to take this off.

5
00:00:52,261 --> 00:00:53,971
No, no, no.
Hey, you said you like surprises.

6
00:00:54,054 --> 00:00:56,098
Yeah, I do. When I know what they are.

7
00:00:56,181 --> 00:00:57,891
You're going to love it.

8
00:00:57,975 --> 00:00:59,351
Promise.

00:00:59,434 --> 00:01:02,896

I pulled some favors

Oh, excuse me.

46
00:03:24,746 --> 00:03:26,998
Sorry. It does that sometimes.

47
00:03:44,558 --> 00:03:47,728
Some fun facts
about the Sky View Tower.

48
00:03:47,811 --> 00:03:52,023
It's 494 feet tall
and weighs over 9,000 tons.

49
00:03:52,107 --> 00:03:55,318
It's made of steel
and reinforced concrete and glass.

50
00:03:55,902 --> 00:03:58,613
And even more impressive,
the entire project

51
00:03:58,697 --> 00:04:01,199
was completed five months
ahead of schedule.

52
00:04:02,451 --> 00:04:03,577
Is that a good thing?

53
00:04:47,579 --> 00:04:48,747
Wow.

54
00:04:49,331 --> 00:04:50,916
What did I tell you?

55
00:04:50,999 --> 00:04:53,835
- Fancy.
- Yes?

56
00:04:54,711 --> 00:04:55,712
May I help you?

57
00:04:55,796 --> 00:04:58,173
We have a reservation. Campbell.

58
00:05:01,092 --> 00:05:02,803
Oh, I'm sorry,

59
00:05:02,886 --> 00:05:06,014
but we're already over capacity
for opening night.

60
00:05:06,097 --> 00:05:07,599
We cannot accommodate you.

61
00:05:07,682 --> 00:05:09,184
If you wouldn't mind
just stepping aside.

62
00:05:09,267 --> 00:05:10,185
Thank you so much.

63
00:05:10,268 --> 00:05:11,853
It's okay. I worked it out with Jake.

64
00:05:12,562 --> 00:05:13,814
Is he here? I could speak with...

65
00:05:13,897 --> 00:05:18,735
We let Jake go this morning.
Thank you so much.

66
00:05:18,819 --> 00:05:21,780
- What's going on?
- One second, one second. Um...

67
00:05:21,863 --> 00:05:23,615
Sir, I know you're a very important man,

68
00:05:23,698 --> 00:05:25,659
but you think maybe
you could help me out...

69
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,080
Please.

70
00:05:30,163 --> 00:05:31,998
You're tearing me apart.

71
00:05:32,082 --> 00:05:35,043
But I'm sorry, I can't help you.
Now, if you wouldn't mind...

72
00:05:35,126 --> 00:05:38,088
Oh, Mr. Fuller! How nice to see you.

73
00:05:38,171 --> 00:05:41,174
We have a lovely table for you.
Thank you. This way, please.

74
00:05:42,425 --> 00:05:43,718
- Let's go to the bar.
- What?

75
00:05:43,802 --> 00:05:45,178
Just act natural.

76
00:05:50,559 --> 00:05:51,977
Wow.

77
00:05:55,730 --> 00:05:57,607
Wow. Look at that view.

78
00:06:07,325 --> 00:06:08,535

79
00:06:08,618 --> 00:06:09,661

80
00:06:10,328 --> 00:06:11,329
Oh, no.

81
00:06:12,664 --> 00:06:13,665
You're scared of heights.

82
00:06:13,748 --> 00:06:15,917
What? Oh, no. I'm just...

83

before.

Are you kidding me? No, this is...

156

Out of my way! Children first!

Oh my God!

To the elevator!

228
00:15:23,464 --> 00:15:25,258
Excuse me, ma'am.

229
00:15:25,341 --> 00:15:26,634
Please. I need to get to the controls.

00:18:16,304 --> 00:18:17,305
Hey.

241
00:18:18,389 --> 00:18:19,390
Come here.

242
00:19:02,767 --> 00:19:03,934
Well...

243
00:19:04,018 --> 00:19:06,729
I realize vector multiplication
is scary,

244
00:19:06,812 --> 00:19:08,356
but it's not that scary.

245
00:19:09,607 --> 00:19:11,067
All right, that's it for today.

246
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:13,361
We'll start prepping
for the final next week.

247
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:19,325
Ms. Reyes.

248
00:19:22,411 --> 00:19:23,704
We need to talk.

249
00:19:26,415 --> 00:19:27,375
Yeah.

250
00:19:31,504 --> 00:19:33,297
<i>We're going to start a family.</i>

251
00:19:34,298 --> 00:19:36,759
<i>Don't throw that penny.
It could kill somebody.</i>

252
00:19:36,842 --> 00:19:38,594
<i>Everyone down the stairs!</i>

253
00:19:47,228 --> 00:19:49,563
Oh, this dream is ruining my life.

254
00:19:49,647 --> 00:19:51,607
Mine too.

255
00:19:51,691 --> 00:19:53,776
Every night, Stef.

256
00:19:53,859 --> 00:19:55,528
God, I'm not getting any sleep.

257
00:19:55,611 --> 00:19:56,862
Shit, I'm sorry.

258
00:19:58,364 --> 00:20:00,908
Um, can I tell you something?

259
00:20:02,702 --> 00:20:04,328
Yeah, what's up?

260
00:20:05,162 --> 00:20:08,541
So, the woman in my dream.
Her name is Iris, right?

261
00:20:08,624 --> 00:20:09,709
Okay.

262
00:20:10,751 --> 00:20:12,253
That was my grandmother's name.

263
00:20:12,336 --> 00:20:15,881
I, uh... I think I'm dreaming about her.

264
00:20:15,965 --> 00:20:16,966
Are you serious?

265
00:20:17,049 --> 00:20:19,176
Yeah. The thing is,
I never even met her.

266
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:21,053
I don't even know if she's alive.

267
00:20:21,137 --> 00:20:22,304
Okay, well...

268
00:20:22,972 --> 00:20:26,475
either go home
and find out about Grandma

269
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:28,728
and hope that stops the dreams,

270
00:20:28,811 --> 00:20:31,939
or stay here
and die in your sleep for real.

271
00:20:33,065 --> 00:20:34,942
Because I will murder you.

272
00:20:35,025 --> 00:20:36,736
I'm sorry.

273
00:20:36,819 --> 00:20:38,904
- Yeah, yeah, okay.
- Love you.

274
00:20:39,613 --> 00:20:41,574
Yeah. Love you too.

275
00:20:41,657 --> 00:20:43,200
- Go home.
- Yeah.

276
00:20:44,034 --> 00:20:45,035
Quietly.

277
00:20:59,550 --> 00:21:00,718
Okay.

278
00:21:16,942 --> 00:21:18,027
Okay.

279
00:21:19,236 --> 00:21:21,280
- Hey, there she is!
- Hey, Dad.

280
00:21:21,363 --> 00:21:24,325
Welcome home, sweetie.
So glad you're here.

281
00:21:24,408 --> 00:21:25,910
- Yeah, me too.
- I missed you so much.

282
00:21:25,993 --> 00:21:27,077
I know.

283
00:21:27,161 --> 00:21:28,662
Oh, so great to see you.

284
00:21:28,746 --> 00:21:31,123
- Thank you, thank you.
- Let me take that for you.

285
00:21:31,207 --> 00:21:32,249
Hey, sorry.

286
00:21:32,333 --> 00:21:36,170
Charlie took your room a while ago
and my files are in his room,

287
00:21:36,253 --> 00:21:39,507
so I made up the pullout for you.
Is that okay?

288
00:21:39,590 --> 00:21:41,550
Yeah, yeah.
No, that sounds totally fine.

289
00:21:42,301 --> 00:21:46,180
Uh, hey, do we still have that box
of Mom's old stuff?

290
00:21:46,263 --> 00:21:49,892
It had, uh, some photos,
like an address book

291
00:21:49,975 --> 00:21:51,811
with phone numbers in it.

292
00:21:51,894 --> 00:21:53,229
Uh, why do you want that?

293
00:21:53,312 --> 00:21:54,480
Oh, it's not a big deal.

294
00:21:54,563 --> 00:21:56,690
I just thought I saw it
lying around here somewhere.

295
00:21:59,235 --> 00:22:00,653
Stefani, what's going on?

296
00:22:02,571 --> 00:22:05,574
Okay, this is going to sound
really, really weird,

297
00:22:05,658 --> 00:22:09,745
but I just need to find Mom's mom, Iris.

298
00:22:13,833 --> 00:22:16,418
Uh, okay. Yeah, that is weird.

299
00:22:17,670 --> 00:22:20,297
And you know,
I got rid of those boxes years ago

300
00:22:20,381 --> 00:22:21,674
after your mom left.

301
00:22:22,424 --> 00:22:23,968
Oh, hi, Charlie.

302
00:22:24,051 --> 00:22:25,052
Hey.

303
00:22:26,303 --> 00:22:30,391
Um, "Hi, Stef. How are you?
It's so nice to see you."

304
00:22:31,183 --> 00:22:32,393
Yeah, sure.

305
00:22:32,476 --> 00:22:34,311
Uh, I'm going to the cousins'.

306
00:22:34,395 --> 00:22:36,647
Whoa. Now?
Look, your sister just got home.

307
00:22:36,730 --> 00:22:38,065
- I thought we...
- Well, I had plans.

308
00:22:38,148 --> 00:22:39,775
Actually, you know what?
I can drive you.

309
00:22:39,859 --> 00:22:41,694
I was wanting to see them anyways.

310
00:22:41,777 --> 00:22:42,778
It's fine.

311
00:22:42,862 --> 00:22:45,364
Hey. If you're going
to see your cousins,

312
00:22:45,447 --> 00:22:47,658
please don't talk about Iris
to Uncle Howard.

313
00:22:48,367 --> 00:22:50,244
Yeah. Yeah, no problem.

314
00:22:50,327 --> 00:22:51,662
All right.

315
00:22:51,745 --> 00:22:53,622
- Bye. Love you.
- Love you too.

316
00:22:54,456 --> 00:22:56,458
Charlie?

317
00:22:58,127 --> 00:23:00,421
Charlie... Can you just take
these out, please?

318
00:23:00,504 --> 00:23:01,755
Ow. Stef!

319
00:23:01,839 --> 00:23:03,716
I'm trying to talk to you.
What's your problem?

320
00:23:03,799 --> 00:23:04,967
What?

321
00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:08,470
You haven't said anything
this entire time.

322
00:23:08,554 --> 00:23:09,555
Wha...

323
00:23:10,806 --> 00:23:12,266
Stef, why are you here?

324
00:23:12,349 --> 00:23:14,643
I mean, you only come home for holidays.

325
00:23:14,727 --> 00:23:16,186
Okay, I have to tell you something.

326
00:23:16,812 --> 00:23:18,898
But you have to promise not to tell Dad.

327
00:23:20,524 --> 00:23:21,734
What, are you pregnant?

328
00:23:21,817 --> 00:23:23,861
No, I'm not pregnant, Charlie.

329
00:23:23,944 --> 00:23:25,696
- I don't know.
- Why would you even...?

330
00:23:25,779 --> 00:23:27,406
That's not... I mean, you're in college.

331
00:23:27,489 --> 00:23:29,742
Okay, can you just promise me
you won't tell Dad?

332
00:23:29,825 --> 00:23:32,703
- Why would I tell Dad?
- It's serious, Charlie.

333
00:23:32,786 --> 00:23:34,371
All right.

334
00:23:40,085 --> 00:23:41,503
Okay. Um...

335
00:23:44,381 --> 00:23:47,468
I am on academic probation.

336
00:23:50,804 --> 00:23:52,014
Whoa.

337
00:23:53,891 --> 00:23:56,435
What? Charlie, stop laughing!
If I don't get my grades up...

338
00:23:56,518 --> 00:23:58,395
It's kind of a big moment for me.

339
00:23:58,479 --> 00:23:59,813
This is kind of funny.

340
00:23:59,897 --> 00:24:02,399
Straight A's. You're a class president.

341
00:24:02,483 --> 00:24:03,901
Miss Valedictorian
is failing out of school.

342
00:24:03,984 --> 00:24:05,069
Charlie, it's not funny.

343
00:24:05,152 --> 00:24:07,404
If I don't get my grades up,
I will lose my scholarship.

344
00:24:07,488 --> 00:24:08,489
Oh.

345
00:24:09,865 --> 00:24:11,450
- That blows. Sorry.
- Mm-hmm.

346
00:24:12,534 --> 00:24:13,577
What happened?

347
00:24:14,453 --> 00:24:15,788
I mean, I can't sleep.

348
00:24:15,871 --> 00:24:16,830
Every time I close my eyes,

349
00:24:16,914 --> 00:24:20,918
I have this same recurring
nightmare about Iris.

350
00:24:22,211 --> 00:24:24,046
Our grandmother. I don't...

351
00:24:25,506 --> 00:24:27,257
I mean, it has to mean something.

352
00:24:27,341 --> 00:24:28,592
I don't know.

353
00:24:28,676 --> 00:24:29,969
I dream weird things.

354
00:24:31,762 --> 00:24:34,556
I dreamed a hot dog ate me last night.

355
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:35,683
What? That is...

356
00:24:35,766 --> 00:24:37,518
Like the hot dog was eating me.

357
00:24:37,601 --> 00:24:38,602
Okay.

358
00:24:43,357 --> 00:24:45,025
Dude, can you just do something?

359
00:24:45,109 --> 00:24:46,110
Dude, calm down, all right?

360
00:24:46,193 --> 00:24:47,569
- We'll find him.
- Just move a little bit.

361
00:24:47,653 --> 00:24:49,863
I can't pause, all right?
It's an online match. Are you serious?

362
00:24:49,947 --> 00:24:52,491
- I have to look under this.
- Can you do me a kindness? Fuck off.

363
00:24:52,574 --> 00:24:53,993
You remember
what happened last time?

364
00:24:54,076 --> 00:24:55,244
It's a ranked match!

365
00:24:55,327 --> 00:24:57,454
- What's going on?
- I can't find Paco.

366
00:24:57,538 --> 00:24:58,789
Dude, again?

367
00:24:58,872 --> 00:25:00,499
Wait, who's Paco?

368
00:25:00,582 --> 00:25:02,918
No way! Hey, cuz!

369
00:25:03,002 --> 00:25:05,546
Oh my gosh. Hey, can you help us look?

370
00:25:05,629 --> 00:25:07,172
And just watch your feet
where you're stepping.

371
00:25:07,256 --> 00:25:08,424
Yeah, yeah, sure.

372
00:25:08,507 --> 00:25:10,676
I just...
I got to talk to your dad first.

373
00:25:10,759 --> 00:25:12,011
What the fuck you doing home?

374
00:25:12,094 --> 00:25:14,346
Oh, dude, she's flunking out of school.

375
00:25:14,430 --> 00:25:16,932
- Charlie.
- Hey, welcome to the club.

376
00:25:17,016 --> 00:25:18,600
Erik, dude, have you looked anywhere?

377
00:25:18,684 --> 00:25:19,727
Paco's not upstairs!

378
00:25:20,894 --> 00:25:22,730
- Oh. But look who's down here.
- Hi, Julia.

379
00:25:22,813 --> 00:25:24,690
- Oh my gosh. I'm so sorry...
- How you been?

380
00:25:24,773 --> 00:25:26,942
- Charlie!
- Jules!

381
00:25:27,026 --> 00:25:28,318
There's my little Romeo.

382
00:25:28,402 --> 00:25:31,030
So, wait, how did
the promposal with Jenny go?

383
00:25:31,113 --> 00:25:34,033
- Dude, she said yes.
- Oh my God. Stop. Okay, wait.

384
00:25:34,116 --> 00:25:35,701
Who's, uh... Who's Jenny?

385
00:25:36,994 --> 00:25:39,038
Oh, he met her in junior lifeguards.

386
00:25:39,121 --> 00:25:40,330
Junior lifeguards?

387
00:25:40,414 --> 00:25:42,958
Charlie, I didn't know
you were doing junior lifeguards.

388
00:25:43,042 --> 00:25:44,043
You didn't tell me that.

389
00:25:44,126 --> 00:25:45,377
Okay, so what are you going to wear?

390
00:25:45,461 --> 00:25:47,796
Um, I'm just going
to keep it simple.

391
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:49,882
- You know, black blazer...
- Okay, yeah, yeah.

392
00:25:49,965 --> 00:25:52,092
- ...but with like a fun bow tie.
- I like it.

393
00:25:54,887 --> 00:25:58,640
Stef! Stefani! Oh my gosh!

394
00:25:58,724 --> 00:26:00,976
- Hi, honey.
- Hi, Aunt Brenda.

395
00:26:01,060 --> 00:26:02,519
- How long are you here for?
- Not long.

396
00:26:02,603 --> 00:26:04,271
Is Uncle Howard around?

397
00:26:04,354 --> 00:26:06,231
Yeah. Yeah, he's out back. I'll get him.

398
00:26:08,067 --> 00:26:10,110
Howard! Stefani's here. Come in!

399
00:26:10,194 --> 00:26:11,695
Great!

400
00:26:13,405 --> 00:26:15,449
You look a little tired.
Is everything okay?

401
00:26:15,532 --> 00:26:17,785
- Oh.
- Stefi! Look at you!

402
00:26:17,868 --> 00:26:19,078
- Hey!
- Come here, come here.

403
00:26:19,161 --> 00:26:20,412
Oh, sweetie.

404
00:26:20,496 --> 00:26:22,414
Oh, so good to see you.
Hey, are you hungry?

405
00:26:22,498 --> 00:26:23,749
I was just gonna make some lunch.

406
00:26:23,832 --> 00:26:24,917
No, actually.

407
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,627
I came here
because I wanted to talk to you

408
00:26:26,710 --> 00:26:29,004
about your mother, Iris.

409
00:26:29,088 --> 00:26:30,923
I know you don't
like to talk about her...

410
00:26:31,006 --> 00:26:32,216
There's not much to tell.

411
00:26:32,299 --> 00:26:33,634
Hey, kids, come on, lunch!

412
00:26:33,717 --> 00:26:38,639
It's just that I've been having
this recurring nightmare about her.

413
00:26:38,722 --> 00:26:40,766
Oh, honey.
It's probably just stress.

414
00:26:40,849 --> 00:26:42,267
You should try Melatonin.

415
00:26:42,351 --> 00:26:43,936
Okay, but the weird thing is

416
00:26:44,019 --> 00:26:48,148
I've been dreaming about a real place
from 50 years ago.

417
00:26:48,232 --> 00:26:50,359
It was like a restaurant
called the Sky View.

418
00:26:53,695 --> 00:26:54,988
You know what it is.

419
00:26:55,072 --> 00:26:56,865
Did Iris tell you about it?

420
00:26:57,699 --> 00:26:59,785
What did she say? Did she say anything?

421
00:26:59,868 --> 00:27:01,245
Maybe if I could talk to her...

422
00:27:01,328 --> 00:27:02,454
Talk to who?

423
00:27:02,538 --> 00:27:04,498
Oh, Stefis dreaming about Grandma Iris.

424
00:27:04,581 --> 00:27:07,376
- Ooh, Psycho Granny?
- I thought she was dead.

425
00:27:07,459 --> 00:27:09,128
Well, she's dead to us.

426
00:27:09,211 --> 00:27:10,170
Yeah, Stefi.

427
00:27:10,254 --> 00:27:13,799
Iris Campbell is a very deeply
disturbed woman. End of story.

428
00:27:13,882 --> 00:27:15,008
Look, if I could just talk to her,

429
00:27:15,092 --> 00:27:17,344
then maybe
I can get these dreams to stop.

430
00:27:17,427 --> 00:27:18,720
- Stef, just drop it.
- I don't get it.

431
00:27:18,804 --> 00:27:21,140
- What happened that was so bad?
- For one thing,

432
00:27:21,223 --> 00:27:22,850
she's the reason
that your mother is so screwed up.

433
00:27:22,933 --> 00:27:24,101
- What?
- Look, I just don't want to

434
00:27:24,184 --> 00:27:25,310
talk about this anymore. Okay?

435
00:27:25,394 --> 00:27:27,604
Uncle Howard, please.
I just need to know.

436
00:27:27,688 --> 00:27:29,982
Look, Stefi.

437
00:27:32,317 --> 00:27:33,652
After our father died...

438
00:27:34,736 --> 00:27:37,072
Iris just snapped.

439
00:27:38,198 --> 00:27:39,908
She wouldn't let us go to school.

440
00:27:39,992 --> 00:27:42,244
She locked us inside the house.

441
00:27:42,327 --> 00:27:46,081
She obsessed about all the horrific ways
we could die.

442
00:27:46,165 --> 00:27:50,210
And eventually it got so bad,
I mean, so bad,

443
00:27:50,294 --> 00:27:51,670
that the State came in

444
00:27:51,753 --> 00:27:53,797
and they took your mother and I
away from her.

445
00:27:54,590 --> 00:27:55,632
But it didn't end there.

446
00:27:55,716 --> 00:27:57,593
She tracked us all through foster care,

447
00:27:57,676 --> 00:27:59,553
and when the kids were born,

448
00:27:59,636 --> 00:28:02,556
she started sending us
these horrible letters

449
00:28:02,639 --> 00:28:04,057
that were full of obituaries

450
00:28:04,141 --> 00:28:06,268
and these disturbing pictures
of dead bodies.

451
00:28:06,351 --> 00:28:09,188
We had to move
so she couldn't contact us anymore.

452
00:28:10,731 --> 00:28:11,773
So, uh...

453
00:28:14,151 --> 00:28:16,486
Do you still have
any of those letters though?

454
00:28:19,823 --> 00:28:20,824
Stefi.

455
00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:23,285
Listen to me.

456
00:28:23,368 --> 00:28:26,830
That woman is a sick
and dangerous person.

457
00:28:27,789 --> 00:28:30,125
And for your well-being and your safety,

458
00:28:30,709 --> 00:28:32,211
stay the hell away from her.

459
00:28:32,878 --> 00:28:33,795
Uh...

460
00:28:38,884 --> 00:28:40,177
I found Paco!

461
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:41,595
Oh! Thank God!

462
00:28:41,678 --> 00:28:44,598
I'm sure he'd love to be
in the living room right now.

463
00:28:44,681 --> 00:28:47,059
- He was in the pantry.
- Come on, guys. Let's go.

464
00:28:47,142 --> 00:28:48,644
How did he even get in there?

465
00:28:49,519 --> 00:28:50,687
I need you to help me.

466
00:28:52,356 --> 00:28:55,359
You heard your uncle. Just let it go.

467
00:28:55,442 --> 00:28:56,568
Just let it go.

468
00:28:57,861 --> 00:28:58,904
You don't understand.

469
00:28:58,987 --> 00:29:02,074
My whole life is falling apart
because of this dream.

470
00:29:02,157 --> 00:29:05,410
And not only that,
I feel like I'm losing my mind.

471
00:29:05,494 --> 00:29:07,663
Please, you are the only person
who can help me.

472
00:29:07,746 --> 00:29:10,749
Howard would never forgive me
if I put you in touch with Iris.

473
00:29:11,708 --> 00:29:12,668
Please.

474
00:29:19,341 --> 00:29:20,550
Whatever you do,

475
00:29:20,634 --> 00:29:25,180
do not look in the bottom drawer
of the dining room cabinet.

476
00:31:03,653 --> 00:31:04,780
Hi. Um...

477
00:31:05,614 --> 00:31:08,241
I'm here to see Iris Campbell.

478
00:31:08,325 --> 00:31:09,701
<i>Did you not see the signs?</i>

479
00:31:09,785 --> 00:31:12,496
Uh... Yeah. Yes, I did, but...

480
00:31:12,579 --> 00:31:15,665
<i>Then get the fuck out of here.
No visitors.</i>

481
00:31:15,749 --> 00:31:16,875
I'm your granddaughter.

482
00:31:17,751 --> 00:31:18,877
<i>Stefani.</i>

483
00:31:22,130 --> 00:31:25,550
<i>Empty your pockets.
Phone, keys, everything.</i>

484
00:31:25,634 --> 00:31:27,469
Well, I'm not dangerous.

485
00:31:28,261 --> 00:31:29,971
It's not you I'm afraid of.

486
00:31:31,431 --> 00:31:32,808
Uh...

487
00:32:48,425 --> 00:32:49,968
Come in slowly.

488
00:33:10,155 --> 00:33:12,365
Shut the door. Quick, quick, quick!

489
00:33:15,744 --> 00:33:16,828
Don't move.

490
00:33:23,793 --> 00:33:24,961
Oh my God.

491
00:33:26,463 --> 00:33:27,464
It really is you.

492
00:33:30,425 --> 00:33:32,260
I can see your mother in you.

493
00:33:34,679 --> 00:33:35,972
Hi. I'm Stefani...

494
00:33:36,056 --> 00:33:39,518
Stop! Stop. Don't move.

495
00:33:39,601 --> 00:33:41,061
Not until I tell you.

496
00:33:43,313 --> 00:33:44,523
Trying to trick me, aren't you?

497
00:33:46,733 --> 00:33:48,818
Getting me
to let my guard down.

498
00:33:48,902 --> 00:33:49,903
I...

499
00:33:50,654 --> 00:33:52,030
There you go. Come on.

500
00:33:53,281 --> 00:33:54,699
Come here. Sit.

501
00:33:56,493 --> 00:33:57,536
Okay. Um...

502
00:33:57,619 --> 00:33:58,662
Sit.

503
00:33:59,913 --> 00:34:00,914
That's it.

504
00:34:02,249 --> 00:34:05,126
So, how is Darlene?

505
00:34:05,710 --> 00:34:07,796
- Your mom okay?
- Oh. Uh...

506
00:34:07,879 --> 00:34:09,589
No. Uh, I don't know.

507
00:34:09,673 --> 00:34:14,886
She, uh... she left when I was ten,
so we don't see her anymore.

508
00:34:14,970 --> 00:34:15,929
Oh.

509
00:34:19,683 --> 00:34:21,893
But you saw my letters.
That's why you're here, right?

510
00:34:22,727 --> 00:34:24,145
No. Um...

511
00:34:25,355 --> 00:34:28,817
I'm actually here because
I've been dreaming about the Sky View.

512
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:31,361
- What?
- Yeah.

513
00:34:31,444 --> 00:34:33,280
Yeah, every single night
for the past two months.

514
00:34:33,363 --> 00:34:35,240
It's the same dream.

515
00:34:35,323 --> 00:34:38,785
In it, you're on a date,
but then the dance floor breaks

516
00:34:38,868 --> 00:34:41,371
and then there's an explosion
and then you...

517
00:34:41,454 --> 00:34:43,290
Fall. And die.

518
00:34:43,373 --> 00:34:45,625
Yeah. Yeah, everyone dies.

519
00:34:46,543 --> 00:34:47,961
It wasn't just your dream.

520
00:34:49,087 --> 00:34:50,839
It was my premonition.

521
00:34:51,756 --> 00:34:53,842
Years ago, at the Sky View,

522
00:34:53,925 --> 00:34:56,595
I got a glimpse into the future

523
00:34:56,678 --> 00:34:58,847
and saw what Death was about to do.

524
00:35:03,810 --> 00:35:06,688
I was going to do this at dinner,
but seeing as we have this view...

525
00:35:10,692 --> 00:35:13,486
Hey! Don't throw that penny.
It could kill somebody.

526
00:35:13,570 --> 00:35:14,988
Oh, I'm so sorry. Of course.

527
00:35:15,530 --> 00:35:16,531
Fat ass.

528
00:35:16,615 --> 00:35:19,159
These past few years
have been absolutely magical.

529
00:35:19,242 --> 00:35:21,870
And that's all because of you.

530
00:35:21,953 --> 00:35:23,204
No, no, no. I...

531
00:35:24,748 --> 00:35:25,999
This isn't right. I...

532
00:35:26,082 --> 00:35:27,334
Is that a no?

533
00:35:28,835 --> 00:35:30,462
Everyone's going to die.

534
00:35:30,545 --> 00:35:32,547
No, the whole building
is going to come down.

535
00:35:32,631 --> 00:35:34,257
Are you serious?

536
00:35:36,176 --> 00:35:37,886
- The penny.
- Iris?

537
00:35:37,969 --> 00:35:39,596
- Give me that!
- What the hell, lady?

538
00:35:39,679 --> 00:35:41,139
- Give it to me!
- What are you doing?

539
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:43,808
What the fuck is wrong with you?

540
00:35:43,892 --> 00:35:47,896
♪ <i>Well...</i> ♪

541
00:35:47,979 --> 00:35:48,980

549
00:36:03,620 --> 00:36:05,830
Stop playing! Stop playing!

550
00:36:05,914 --> 00:36:07,916
<i>Everyone needs
to get off the dance floor!</i>

551
00:36:08,833 --> 00:36:11,211
<i>The glass is about to break.
Everyone needs to get off now!</i>

552
00:36:11,294 --> 00:36:12,545
- Ma'am.
- Wait! No!

553
00:36:12,629 --> 00:36:14,130
Get off the dance floor!

554
00:36:14,214 --> 00:36:16,049
- Iris!
- You need to get off!

555
00:36:16,132 --> 00:36:17,342
Get off!

556
00:36:21,930 --> 00:36:24,015
I saved a lot of lives
that night.

557
00:36:25,016 --> 00:36:26,810
Lives that were never meant to be saved.

558
00:36:28,561 --> 00:36:30,230
They closed the restaurant after that.

559
00:36:31,231 --> 00:36:34,359
Said it needed additional renovations.

560
00:36:35,402 --> 00:36:37,278
But it never reopened.

561
00:36:37,362 --> 00:36:39,155
Eventually they tore it down.

562
00:36:39,239 --> 00:36:41,533
Wait, so you stopped the disaster.

563
00:36:42,659 --> 00:36:44,119
Yes.

564
00:36:47,580 --> 00:36:49,874
But Death doesn't like it
when you fuck with his plans.

565
00:36:50,458 --> 00:36:52,085
So, over the years, he came back

566
00:36:52,168 --> 00:36:55,046
and he killed everyone
who was there that night.

567
00:36:55,130 --> 00:36:56,464
Including my Paul.

568
00:36:59,259 --> 00:37:02,846
Wait a minute. I'm sorry. Did you...
Did you say Death came back?

569
00:37:02,929 --> 00:37:05,432
He's a relentless son of a bitch.

570
00:37:05,515 --> 00:37:07,434
Won't stop until he finishes the job,

571
00:37:07,517 --> 00:37:09,853
but I taught myself
how to see him coming.

572
00:37:10,437 --> 00:37:13,148
To anticipate his every move.

573
00:37:13,231 --> 00:37:16,025
I've been keeping him at bay
for years now.

574
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:19,154
But now he's got me. Cancer.

575
00:37:19,237 --> 00:37:20,488
Oh. Uh...

576
00:37:20,572 --> 00:37:22,532
- Believe that shit?
- Sorry.

577
00:37:22,615 --> 00:37:24,367
Got the diagnosis two months ago.

578
00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:27,620
Wait, that's when
I started having my dream.

579
00:37:27,704 --> 00:37:29,038
See? It's a sign.

580
00:37:29,122 --> 00:37:32,041
Okay, but why am I dreaming
about what you saw?

581
00:37:32,125 --> 00:37:34,627
Maybe my cancer
passed my premonition onto you.

582
00:37:34,711 --> 00:37:36,671
Maybe it's fate's demented
sense of humor.

583
00:37:36,755 --> 00:37:38,006
Who the hell knows.

584
00:37:38,089 --> 00:37:41,217
What matters
is that when the Universe speaks,

585
00:37:41,301 --> 00:37:42,844
you pay attention.

586
00:37:55,148 --> 00:37:56,441
I see you, you fuck.

587
00:38:01,988 --> 00:38:05,325
- Um... Who are you talking to?
- Death.

588
00:38:06,284 --> 00:38:08,536
He thinks I'm distracted
because you're here.

589
00:38:09,871 --> 00:38:12,248
I have to teach you
everything in this book.

590
00:38:12,332 --> 00:38:14,042
It'll take some time
to learn the basics,

591
00:38:14,125 --> 00:38:15,627
so you'll need to stay here.

592
00:38:15,710 --> 00:38:16,711
Stay here?

593
00:38:16,795 --> 00:38:17,879
The outside world is too dangerous.

594
00:38:17,962 --> 00:38:19,964
I haven't stepped out there in 20 years.

595
00:38:20,048 --> 00:38:22,050
In here, we can be safe.

596
00:38:23,551 --> 00:38:24,761
Oh.

597
00:38:24,844 --> 00:38:26,137
See that?

598
00:38:26,221 --> 00:38:27,639
Yeah.

599
00:38:27,722 --> 00:38:31,059
This is all my research.
My life's work.

600
00:38:31,142 --> 00:38:34,187
Look, I'm sorry. I can't stay here.

601
00:38:34,270 --> 00:38:36,272
I have to get back to school,

602
00:38:36,356 --> 00:38:38,441
but, you know,
I'll come back and I'll visit.

603
00:38:38,525 --> 00:38:41,361
No, I'm sick!
I won't be alive that long.

604
00:38:41,444 --> 00:38:42,821
You can't leave.

605
00:38:42,904 --> 00:38:43,988
Don't you see?

606
00:38:44,781 --> 00:38:46,908
Death is coming for our family.

607
00:38:47,826 --> 00:38:49,577
Uh...

608
00:38:50,245 --> 00:38:51,621
You don't believe me.

609
00:38:51,704 --> 00:38:56,084
No. Um... I think I made a mistake.

610
00:38:56,167 --> 00:38:58,837
I think it was probably just a dream.

611
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:01,172
No, wait. At least take the book.

612
00:39:01,923 --> 00:39:02,924
Stefani!

613
00:39:03,633 --> 00:39:04,801
Stefani!

614
00:39:27,949 --> 00:39:29,993
Stefani! Stop!

615
00:39:31,119 --> 00:39:33,204
Look, I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have come here.

616
00:39:33,955 --> 00:39:36,165
This book is a lifeline.

617
00:39:36,249 --> 00:39:37,125
It will show you

618
00:39:37,208 --> 00:39:38,960
everything you need to know
to keep our family safe.

619
00:39:40,962 --> 00:39:42,589
You still don't believe me.

620
00:39:47,176 --> 00:39:48,136
Step back.

621
00:39:48,219 --> 00:39:49,596
What? Why?

622
00:39:51,973 --> 00:39:53,391
Seeing is believing.

623
00:40:15,455 --> 00:40:18,583
Hey, Stef. Her face
really explode right in front of you?

624
00:40:18,666 --> 00:40:21,002
- Erik! Just leave her alone.
- I'm...

625
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:23,630
It's my bad, Stef. I'm just curious.

626
00:40:25,506 --> 00:40:28,801
Hey. How are you holding up?

627
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:32,221
I'm sorry, Uncle Howard.

628
00:40:33,765 --> 00:40:36,726
You were right about Iris.
I... I never should've went there.

629
00:40:36,809 --> 00:40:39,020
Honey, there's no need to apologize.

630
00:40:39,103 --> 00:40:41,981
I'm so sorry you had to go through that.

631
00:40:46,194 --> 00:40:48,029
She said something to me
before she died.

632
00:40:48,112 --> 00:40:49,864
She said Death was coming
for our family.

633
00:40:49,948 --> 00:40:52,742
That's crazy, right?

634
00:40:52,825 --> 00:40:53,993
Oh my God.

635
00:40:55,119 --> 00:40:56,287
I can't believe it.

636
00:40:56,371 --> 00:40:59,290
I emailed her.
I just didn't think she'd show up. I...

637
00:41:00,083 --> 00:41:01,084
Come on.

638
00:41:09,467 --> 00:41:10,468
Is that, um...

639
00:41:12,261 --> 00:41:13,262
Is that Mom?

640
00:41:14,764 --> 00:41:15,765
Yeah.

641
00:41:21,354 --> 00:41:22,438
Darlene!

642
00:41:24,524 --> 00:41:26,609
- Wow.
- Um...

643
00:41:28,403 --> 00:41:29,570
I can come back.

644
00:41:29,654 --> 00:41:31,406
Oh, don't be ridiculous.
Come on.

645
00:41:31,489 --> 00:41:32,824
Get down here. Come here.

646
00:41:36,327 --> 00:41:37,954
Think she'll come
to the barbecue?

647
00:41:41,541 --> 00:41:43,167
Stef. Hey, wait up.

648
00:41:43,251 --> 00:41:45,211
If she's going
to Uncle Howard's house, then I'm not.

649
00:41:45,294 --> 00:41:46,337
You can get a ride with Dad.

650
00:41:46,421 --> 00:41:48,756
Uh...
You're not even going to talk to her?

651
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:49,841
Come on.

652
00:41:49,924 --> 00:41:51,342
You don't remember her like I do.

653
00:41:51,926 --> 00:41:53,302
- Just give her a chance.
- Why?

654
00:41:54,178 --> 00:41:56,055
Charlie, she abandoned us

655
00:41:56,139 --> 00:41:58,224
and now she rolls in here
after all these years,

656
00:41:58,307 --> 00:42:00,351
and wants to act like nothing happened?

657
00:42:02,020 --> 00:42:05,231
Yeah. Because who would do that? Right?

658
00:42:05,815 --> 00:42:06,816
Wait. What?

659
00:42:06,899 --> 00:42:09,068
- Nothing. Forget it.
- No.

660
00:42:09,152 --> 00:42:10,737
No. What's that supposed to mean?

661
00:42:10,820 --> 00:42:13,740
I tried calling you
so many times and nothing.

662
00:42:13,823 --> 00:42:14,782
Same with Julia.

663
00:42:14,866 --> 00:42:16,701
You used to be best friends.
You don't even talk anymore.

664
00:42:16,784 --> 00:42:18,619
Okay, I'm sorry.

665
00:42:19,579 --> 00:42:21,622
I've just been distracted
the last couple of months

666
00:42:21,706 --> 00:42:22,790
because of this nightmare.

667
00:42:22,874 --> 00:42:25,418
Okay, but what about before that?
It's been like this ever since you left.

668
00:42:27,086 --> 00:42:29,505
You're mad at Mom,
but you haven't been around either.

669
00:42:29,589 --> 00:42:30,715
I'm not like her!

670
00:42:31,799 --> 00:42:32,800
Okay?

671
00:42:33,968 --> 00:42:35,219
I'm not crazy.

672
00:42:38,473 --> 00:42:40,850
Yeah, you're right. You're not crazy.

673
00:42:42,602 --> 00:42:43,686
You just don't care.

674
00:44:10,606 --> 00:44:12,775
Now you got it. Watch out for splinters.

675
00:44:27,874 --> 00:44:29,375
Hey, there she is!

676
00:44:30,293 --> 00:44:31,377
Hey!

677
00:44:31,460 --> 00:44:34,046
Come here. So glad you made it.

678
00:44:35,715 --> 00:44:37,508
You know, I didn't think
you were actually going to come.

679
00:44:37,592 --> 00:44:38,968
Thank you for inviting me.

680
00:44:39,051 --> 00:44:40,344
Of course. Come on in.

681
00:44:40,428 --> 00:44:42,305
Hey, everybody! Come on! Come on over!

682
00:44:44,056 --> 00:44:45,725
- I made cookies.
- That's great!

683
00:44:46,392 --> 00:44:48,936
- Can I try one?
- Yes, of course.

684
00:44:54,984 --> 00:44:57,111
- Does this have peanut butter?
- Yeah.

685
00:45:00,239 --> 00:45:02,074
Are you trying
to kill my brother?

686
00:45:02,950 --> 00:45:05,119
- Oh my God. Bobby's allergic.
- Yeah.

687
00:45:05,203 --> 00:45:06,621
I totally forgot.
I'm so sorry.

688
00:45:06,704 --> 00:45:08,915
You know, the most important thing
is that you're here, so...

689
00:45:08,998 --> 00:45:11,167
Uh, Bobby Bartender, drinks!
Drinks all around!

690
00:45:19,967 --> 00:45:21,010
Family.

691
00:45:22,136 --> 00:45:24,555
You don't get to pick the one you get,

692
00:45:24,639 --> 00:45:27,391
just got to love the one that you got.

693
00:45:29,143 --> 00:45:31,062
Now, our mother...

694
00:45:31,896 --> 00:45:34,148
she lived alone
until the day that she died.

695
00:45:34,732 --> 00:45:38,194
And her death should
be a reminder to all of us

696
00:45:38,277 --> 00:45:39,612
to enjoy life

697
00:45:39,695 --> 00:45:41,906
and spend the time
that we have together.

698
00:45:44,492 --> 00:45:46,327
Because we're not going to get any back.

699
00:45:47,745 --> 00:45:50,539
- I love you guys.
- Aw.

700
00:45:50,623 --> 00:45:53,417
Cheers to that! Cheers!

701
00:45:58,923 --> 00:46:00,383
This is strong.

702
00:46:01,384 --> 00:46:02,677
What did you put in there?

703
00:46:03,678 --> 00:46:06,013
Julia? Oh, Jules!

704
00:46:06,097 --> 00:46:07,306
Are you all right?

705
00:46:07,390 --> 00:46:09,934
Oh my God.
There was a bug in there. Ugh.

706
00:46:10,518 --> 00:46:11,686
Extra protein.

707
00:46:32,707 --> 00:46:34,375
You on?

708
00:46:36,460 --> 00:46:37,795
Oh.

709
00:46:37,878 --> 00:46:39,672
- I got it.
- I don't think you've got it.

710
00:46:39,755 --> 00:46:40,673
Oh, it's coming.

711
00:46:45,052 --> 00:46:47,179
Actually, I'm starting
a new life guarding job.

712
00:46:47,263 --> 00:46:48,347
- That's great.
- Yeah.

713
00:46:48,431 --> 00:46:49,765
Charlie!

714
00:46:49,849 --> 00:46:50,933
Get up here!

715
00:47:07,950 --> 00:47:09,702
Jeez! Whoa!

716
00:47:12,246 --> 00:47:14,707
- Erik!
- Ma, grill's ready.

717
00:47:20,921 --> 00:47:23,132
Mm.

718
00:47:32,266 --> 00:47:33,351
Mind if I join you?

719
00:47:33,434 --> 00:47:35,561
Have a seat. Take a load off.

720
00:47:37,855 --> 00:47:40,024
Oh, yeah. There we go.

721
00:47:41,192 --> 00:47:42,902
It's quite the setup
you've got here.

722
00:47:43,861 --> 00:47:47,114
Well, I wanted the kids
to have a happy childhood.

723
00:47:47,198 --> 00:47:49,367
Unlike some people I know.

724
00:47:49,450 --> 00:47:50,993
You're not talking about us, are you?

725
00:47:51,077 --> 00:47:52,536
- Oh, no.
- We had a great childhood.

726
00:47:52,620 --> 00:47:54,121
- Mm-hmm.
- I mean, look at me.

727
00:47:54,205 --> 00:47:56,374
I turned out... fabulous.

728
00:48:00,711 --> 00:48:01,712
Yep.

729
00:48:04,382 --> 00:48:05,341
Huh.

730
00:48:06,258 --> 00:48:07,259
Howard.

731
00:48:07,968 --> 00:48:09,220
- What?
- Come on. What is that?

732
00:48:09,303 --> 00:48:11,389
It looks like a house key to me.

733
00:48:12,390 --> 00:48:13,849
Come on.
You know we've got the spare room.

734
00:48:13,933 --> 00:48:14,892
I know.

735
00:48:14,975 --> 00:48:17,144
And it's got to be better
than bouncing around trailer parks.

736
00:48:25,111 --> 00:48:26,737
I don't think this is a good idea.

737
00:48:26,821 --> 00:48:28,906
It's never too late for a second chance.

738
00:48:32,493 --> 00:48:33,494
I'm sorry.

739
00:48:37,581 --> 00:48:39,625
They're better off without me.

740
00:48:42,837 --> 00:48:44,588
Pick up, pick up. Come on.

741
00:48:46,340 --> 00:48:48,426
Okay, wait,
you bounce me or I bounce you?

742
00:48:48,509 --> 00:48:50,219
You're bouncing me,
you're bouncing me.

743
00:49:01,814 --> 00:49:04,024
Hey, Dad!
Come show us your back flip!

744
00:49:04,108 --> 00:49:06,610
- What? No, no, no.
- Yeah, come on, Uncle Howard!

745
00:49:06,694 --> 00:49:09,905
- Come on, Howard!
- Howard! Howard! Howard!

746
00:49:11,782 --> 00:49:13,033
Help him up, help him up.

747
00:49:13,117 --> 00:49:15,286
Thank you.

748
00:49:17,455 --> 00:49:18,831
- Oh, yeah!
- There you go.

749
00:49:21,500 --> 00:49:22,460
Stop stalling.

750
00:49:22,543 --> 00:49:23,794
What's the worst thing
that could happen?

751
00:49:24,712 --> 00:49:26,255
All right. Here we go. Watch out.

752
00:49:26,338 --> 00:49:27,381
Wait! Stop!

753
00:49:36,599 --> 00:49:40,561
- Oh, nice catch, Aunt D. All right.
- All right, here we go.

754
00:49:40,644 --> 00:49:41,979
- Okay, Dad.
- Let's do it.

755
00:49:42,062 --> 00:49:44,190
- Stay away from that edge.
- Come on, Uncle Howard.

756
00:49:44,273 --> 00:49:45,649
There you go. Just like college.

757
00:49:45,733 --> 00:49:47,109
Yep, nice.

758
00:49:47,693 --> 00:49:49,737
- Mom, you watch this?
- Careful, Howard.

759
00:50:15,971 --> 00:50:18,140
Not taking it out of there.
That's cheating!

760
00:50:18,224 --> 00:50:20,643
Hey, Stefi!

761
00:50:20,726 --> 00:50:22,269
- You made it!
- Stefani.

762
00:50:23,270 --> 00:50:24,647
I'm glad you decided to come.

763
00:50:24,730 --> 00:50:26,565
Now watch the master.

764
00:50:27,775 --> 00:50:29,527
Now the whole family's here!

765
00:50:33,697 --> 00:50:35,950
I'm okay. I'm all right.

766
00:50:36,033 --> 00:50:37,117
Whoa, good.

767
00:50:41,163 --> 00:50:43,249
I'm okay. It's okay.

768
00:50:43,332 --> 00:50:45,292
It's all right. Whoa.

769
00:50:58,806 --> 00:51:00,474
The former things
have passed away.

770
00:51:00,558 --> 00:51:03,602
Neither shall there
be mourning nor pain.

771
00:51:03,686 --> 00:51:06,897
And he shall wipe away
every tear from their eyes.

772
00:51:08,315 --> 00:51:09,567
And death shall be no more.

773
00:51:57,740 --> 00:51:58,949
Hey.

774
00:52:05,497 --> 00:52:06,915
What is all this stuff?

775
00:52:12,254 --> 00:52:13,172
Okay.

776
00:52:14,006 --> 00:52:16,550
I found these papers in Iris's book.

777
00:52:16,634 --> 00:52:21,805
They are obituaries and articles
for the people who were at the Sky View

778
00:52:21,889 --> 00:52:24,058
on the night
that Iris had her premonition.

779
00:52:25,225 --> 00:52:29,104
Each one of these people went on to die
in some weird and messed up way.

780
00:52:29,188 --> 00:52:30,481
And not only that,

781
00:52:30,564 --> 00:52:33,692
they all died in the same order
as Iris's premonition.

782
00:52:33,776 --> 00:52:36,362
Hundreds of people
were supposed to die that night,

783
00:52:36,445 --> 00:52:38,822
but Iris... Iris stopped the disaster.

784
00:52:40,074 --> 00:52:42,951
So, Death came back for them one by one.

785
00:52:44,036 --> 00:52:45,954
Since there were so many survivors,

786
00:52:46,038 --> 00:52:48,540
it took years for Death
to get to all of them.

787
00:52:48,624 --> 00:52:50,459
But eventually it got to Iris.

788
00:52:52,336 --> 00:52:54,004
I mean, she was the last to die
in the premonition.

789
00:52:55,005 --> 00:52:56,757
It was her and a little boy.

790
00:52:58,217 --> 00:52:59,718
But she was prepared.

791
00:53:00,886 --> 00:53:04,556
She single-handedly held off Death
for decades.

792
00:53:04,640 --> 00:53:05,933
Stefani, sweetie,

793
00:53:07,267 --> 00:53:09,561
I don't think this is
the appropriate time for this.

794
00:53:09,645 --> 00:53:11,021
Yeah, I mean,
none of this even has anything

795
00:53:11,105 --> 00:53:12,231
to do with us, right?

796
00:53:12,314 --> 00:53:13,565
- No.
- Why are we even here?

797
00:53:13,649 --> 00:53:15,150
No, it has everything to do with us.

798
00:53:15,234 --> 00:53:19,363
I mean, because Death took so long
to make its way through the survivors,

799
00:53:19,446 --> 00:53:20,823
these people went on to have families.

800
00:53:20,906 --> 00:53:23,158
Families that they never should've had.

801
00:53:23,742 --> 00:53:25,244
So Death took them too.

802
00:53:26,203 --> 00:53:28,831
I mean, don't you see this?

803
00:53:30,124 --> 00:53:33,419
Death is coming for us
because we were never supposed to exist.

804
00:53:34,086 --> 00:53:35,546
Okay, so, what,

805
00:53:35,629 --> 00:53:38,340
everybody in this room
is on Death's "hit list"?

806
00:53:38,424 --> 00:53:40,008
- Bobby, stop.
- That's what she's saying.

807
00:53:40,092 --> 00:53:42,010
No, Dad and Aunt Brenda are safe

808
00:53:42,094 --> 00:53:43,554
because they're not
part of Iris's bloodline.

809
00:53:44,471 --> 00:53:46,682
Okay. Following the pattern...

810
00:53:47,850 --> 00:53:51,103
Death makes its way
down each branch by age.

811
00:53:51,186 --> 00:53:53,981
So because Uncle Howard was the oldest,
it'll start with his family first.

812
00:53:54,064 --> 00:53:56,817
- Meaning, Erik, you're next.
- Go fuck yourself.

813
00:53:56,900 --> 00:53:59,111
Then it'll go for Julia, then Bobby.

814
00:54:00,821 --> 00:54:02,322
Then it'll come for our branch,

815
00:54:02,406 --> 00:54:05,826
starting with Darlene,
then me, then Charlie.

816
00:54:07,161 --> 00:54:08,245
Charlie.

817
00:54:09,538 --> 00:54:10,581
You buying this?

818
00:54:11,874 --> 00:54:12,916
I don't know.

819
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:14,376
This is so messed up.

820
00:54:14,460 --> 00:54:15,794
I mean, you're turning our dad's death

821
00:54:15,878 --> 00:54:18,380
into some kind of fucked up
conspiracy theory.

822
00:54:18,464 --> 00:54:19,965
- What is wrong with you?
- No, no, no.

823
00:54:20,048 --> 00:54:21,633
No, it's not a conspiracy theory.

824
00:54:21,717 --> 00:54:22,843
Stef, enough.

825
00:54:22,926 --> 00:54:24,428
- We're all going to die!
- Stop!

826
00:54:24,511 --> 00:54:27,097
I can't listen to this
for one more minute.

827
00:54:27,181 --> 00:54:29,016
That crazy woman's nonsense

828
00:54:29,099 --> 00:54:32,227
has caused enough pain and suffering
for this family.

829
00:54:32,311 --> 00:54:34,062
Hang on.
Aunt Brenda, please just listen.

830
00:54:34,146 --> 00:54:35,147
For God's sake, leave it alone.

831
00:54:35,230 --> 00:54:37,357
Okay, in Iris's book
she mentions somebody

832
00:54:37,441 --> 00:54:39,318
who cheated Death and survived.

833
00:54:39,401 --> 00:54:40,527
Stefani.

834
00:54:40,611 --> 00:54:42,279
- Come on.
- Erik. No, wait.

835
00:54:42,362 --> 00:54:44,364
- I'm worried about you.
- Stop it.

836
00:54:46,033 --> 00:54:47,701
- Let me take care of this.
- Come on, Bobby.

837
00:54:47,785 --> 00:54:48,827
- Brenda.
- Let's go.

838
00:54:48,911 --> 00:54:50,412
- Brenda, I'm sorry.
- No, no, no.

839
00:54:50,496 --> 00:54:51,914
- I didn't know.
- Please.

840
00:54:51,997 --> 00:54:53,457
You believe me, right?

841
00:54:53,540 --> 00:54:54,875
- I'm sorry.
- Julia.

842
00:54:54,958 --> 00:54:56,168
Look, I love you.

843
00:54:58,212 --> 00:54:59,797
But sometimes I really hate you.

844
00:55:20,275 --> 00:55:24,029
I know how convincing
all of this can be.

845
00:55:24,738 --> 00:55:26,240
But it's not real.

846
00:55:27,241 --> 00:55:28,575
How can you say that?

847
00:55:28,659 --> 00:55:31,286
I know Iris taught you all of this.

848
00:55:31,370 --> 00:55:34,164
Don't let my mom's beliefs
derail your life...

849
00:55:35,123 --> 00:55:36,750
the same way they did mine.

850
00:55:40,295 --> 00:55:43,006
Thank you so much for that advice,

851
00:55:43,090 --> 00:55:45,259
but I really don't need a mom anymore.

852
00:55:50,180 --> 00:55:51,682
All right, open wide.

853
00:55:51,765 --> 00:55:52,933
All right, good.

854
00:55:54,977 --> 00:55:56,603
This is going to pinch, all right?
You ready?

855
00:55:56,687 --> 00:55:59,231
- Mm-hmm.
- Five, four, three...

856
00:56:02,359 --> 00:56:04,111
...two, one.

857
00:56:04,194 --> 00:56:05,279
Good job.

858
00:56:07,781 --> 00:56:10,492
Ready to hit the club.
Need you to lock up.

859
00:56:10,576 --> 00:56:12,202
And don't touch any of my liquor.

860
00:56:12,286 --> 00:56:14,246
No, no, you didn't say anything
about locking up.

861
00:56:14,329 --> 00:56:15,205
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

862
00:56:15,289 --> 00:56:16,540
You didn't say shit about closing, dude!

863
00:56:16,623 --> 00:56:18,000
Yeah, cry me a river.

864
00:56:18,083 --> 00:56:19,668
I hope you burn in hell!

865
00:56:22,337 --> 00:56:24,006
Do you believe that shit?

866
00:56:24,089 --> 00:56:25,340
My old man just died.

867
00:56:25,424 --> 00:56:28,927
I come in as a favor to that asshole
and now he wants me to lock up.

868
00:56:30,012 --> 00:56:31,346
- You know what that is?
- Mm-hmm.

869
00:56:31,430 --> 00:56:33,849
You know what that is?
It's inconsiderate.

870
00:56:33,932 --> 00:56:35,559
Anyway, you're all done.

871
00:56:35,642 --> 00:56:37,394
Mm-hmm. Thank you.

872
00:56:37,477 --> 00:56:38,854

What the fuck?

880

Come on.

881

Okay, okay.

Okay, come on.

Shit!

Shit!

886
01:01:05,203 --> 01:01:07,372
Charlie, wake up. Charlie, wake...

887
01:01:07,455 --> 01:01:09,583
Charlie, wake up!

888
01:01:09,666 --> 01:01:11,084
I've been trying to call Erik all night.

889
01:01:11,168 --> 01:01:12,210
He's not answering me.

890
01:01:12,294 --> 01:01:14,254
I don't know where he is. I'm worried.

891
01:01:14,838 --> 01:01:16,214
I'm sure he's fine.

892
01:01:16,298 --> 01:01:17,507
Well, have you heard from him?

893
01:01:24,556 --> 01:01:26,766
I'm going over there.
I need to check on him.

894
01:01:28,602 --> 01:01:30,520
And you're coming too, Charlie!

895
01:01:32,939 --> 01:01:35,192
It keeps going to voicemail.

896
01:01:36,776 --> 01:01:37,819
Is that him?

897
01:01:38,695 --> 01:01:41,448
My friend just said the tattoo parlor
burned down last night.

898
01:01:41,531 --> 01:01:42,782
What?

899
01:01:42,866 --> 01:01:44,701
Stef, Stef, Stef!

900
01:01:45,702 --> 01:01:48,622
Ow! You trying to kill me?

901
01:01:49,206 --> 01:01:50,123
Erik?

902
01:01:50,916 --> 01:01:53,084
Oh, yeah, no, of course it's you.

903
01:01:57,130 --> 01:01:58,215
Dude!

904
01:01:58,298 --> 01:02:00,300
We heard about the fire.
We thought you were dead.

905
01:02:00,383 --> 01:02:01,927
I'm fine.

906
01:02:02,010 --> 01:02:03,678
Oh my God. Are you okay?
I was so worried about you.

907
01:02:03,762 --> 01:02:05,805
Yeah. The firefighters said
I was lucky as fuck

908
01:02:05,889 --> 01:02:07,307
that I was wearing that leather jacket.

909
01:02:07,390 --> 01:02:08,600
Barely got burned.

910
01:02:09,309 --> 01:02:10,727
Ruined my favorite jacket though.

911
01:02:10,810 --> 01:02:12,646
- What is this?
- Oh, yeah, check it out.

912
01:02:13,730 --> 01:02:15,315
I got branded.

913
01:02:15,398 --> 01:02:16,816
Sick, right?

914
01:02:16,900 --> 01:02:17,943
You like it?

915
01:02:18,026 --> 01:02:19,319
You said you were asleep.

916
01:02:19,402 --> 01:02:21,363
You were blowing up my phone
like a goddamn stalker.

917
01:02:21,446 --> 01:02:24,157
- What did you want me to do?
- No, I don't get it. You should be dead.

918
01:02:24,241 --> 01:02:26,326
Right. Yeah, yeah.

919
01:02:26,409 --> 01:02:28,745
Or, you know, maybe...

920
01:02:28,828 --> 01:02:31,831
maybe Death's not actually
coming for our family.

921
01:02:31,915 --> 01:02:34,125
Because that
would be fucking crazy.

922
01:02:34,209 --> 01:02:35,710
Jesus!

923
01:02:35,794 --> 01:02:37,379
Shit!

924
01:02:41,216 --> 01:02:42,550
Or maybe I'm invincible.

925
01:02:43,677 --> 01:02:44,970
Erik.

926
01:02:45,553 --> 01:02:46,680
Erik!

927
01:02:46,763 --> 01:02:48,139
- Yeah?
- Erik, wait.

928
01:02:48,223 --> 01:02:49,683
- Stop, just wait, okay?
- Mm-hmm.

929
01:02:49,766 --> 01:02:51,226
Just because Death
didn't kill you last night,

930
01:02:51,309 --> 01:02:52,769
doesn't mean that you're safe.

931
01:02:54,813 --> 01:02:56,690
Stay away from that tree trimmer!

932
01:02:58,984 --> 01:03:02,028
Is it going to move on its own, Stef?
Is that what it's going to do?

933
01:03:02,112 --> 01:03:04,155
It could fall.

934
01:03:04,239 --> 01:03:06,616
And stay away from these kids.

935
01:03:06,700 --> 01:03:08,368
I'll take my chances.

936
01:03:08,451 --> 01:03:11,830
Stef, how's a couple kids
with a soccer ball going to kill him?

937
01:03:12,622 --> 01:03:14,457
I mean, I don't know.

938
01:03:15,041 --> 01:03:18,378
The trimmer could fall
and hit the leaf blower guy

939
01:03:18,461 --> 01:03:20,171
which causes him to...

940
01:03:20,255 --> 01:03:23,258
blow stuff into the kids' eyes
and then kick the ball into his face.

941
01:03:23,341 --> 01:03:24,926
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

942
01:03:26,261 --> 01:03:27,762
Soccer ball to my face?

943
01:03:29,180 --> 01:03:30,682
That does sound deadly.

944
01:03:31,641 --> 01:03:32,851
I should be more careful.

945
01:03:34,894 --> 01:03:36,146
- Hey!
- What's up?

946
01:03:36,229 --> 01:03:37,564
What happened to you?

947
01:03:37,647 --> 01:03:39,733
Charbroiled by Death, apparently.

948
01:03:39,816 --> 01:03:41,776
- Kiki, that looks really bad.
- Yeah, it's fine.

949
01:03:41,860 --> 01:03:43,611
No, wait. Let me see that.

950
01:03:43,695 --> 01:03:45,947
- Erik, just stay away from the truck.
- Stop.

951
01:03:46,990 --> 01:03:48,199
- Oh, what, this truck?
- Stop!

952
01:03:48,283 --> 01:03:49,576
- Oh my God.
- Please.

953
01:03:49,659 --> 01:03:50,577
This truck right here?

954
01:03:50,660 --> 01:03:52,037
Please just
listen to me for one...

955
01:03:52,120 --> 01:03:53,204
But it's such a beautiful truck.

956
01:03:53,288 --> 01:03:54,622
Please. Stop, stop.
Don't touch...

957
01:03:54,706 --> 01:03:56,207
- Mwah!
- Erik, get away!

958
01:03:56,291 --> 01:03:57,375
Stop!

959
01:03:58,251 --> 01:03:59,586
- You like that?
- Can you just...

960
01:04:00,253 --> 01:04:01,629
Oh my God.

961
01:04:02,422 --> 01:04:04,382
Oh! Uh-oh.

962
01:04:04,466 --> 01:04:06,509
Oh, Erik's tempting Death again.

963
01:04:06,593 --> 01:04:08,011
What's going to happen?

964
01:04:08,094 --> 01:04:11,723
- Stop doing that!
- What is going to happen?

965
01:04:12,724 --> 01:04:14,476
- Nothing at all.
- Please, just...

966
01:04:14,559 --> 01:04:15,560
How about that?

967
01:04:15,643 --> 01:04:16,978
Look,
I'm just trying to help you.

968
01:04:17,062 --> 01:04:18,855
- Okay.
- Try less.

969
01:04:18,938 --> 01:04:21,566
Yeah. Honestly, we're so done
with your garbage.

970
01:04:22,442 --> 01:04:24,944
- Can you please...
- Okay, for the 1,500th time,

971
01:04:25,028 --> 01:04:27,447
no one gives a shit about
your stupid little Death curse, okay?

972
01:04:27,530 --> 01:04:29,491
So take a hint and leave us alone

973
01:04:29,574 --> 01:04:31,493
because Death's
not coming for our family!

974
01:04:36,831 --> 01:04:37,874
Julia!

975
01:04:37,957 --> 01:04:39,042
Shit.

976
01:04:42,170 --> 01:04:43,922
- Julia!
- Julia!

977
01:04:44,005 --> 01:04:45,340
- Julia!
- Julia!

978
01:04:45,423 --> 01:04:48,635
Stop the truck! Stop the truck!

979
01:05:00,271 --> 01:05:02,273
- Stop the truck!
- Hey! Hey!

980
01:05:02,357 --> 01:05:03,441
Stop the fucking truck!

981
01:05:03,525 --> 01:05:04,984
My sister's in the garbage!

- I'm so sorry, sweetie.
- Dad.

998
01:06:12,594 --> 01:06:14,053
We should've believed you, Stef.

999
01:06:17,140 --> 01:06:18,349
No, I...

1000
01:06:20,768 --> 01:06:24,105
I screwed up the order
and now Julia's dead and it's my fault.

1001
01:06:25,023 --> 01:06:30,028
Guys, look. What happened
was traumatic and awful.

1002
01:06:30,111 --> 01:06:31,779
- It's not anybody's fault.
- Marty, please don't.

1003
01:06:34,532 --> 01:06:35,533
It's my fault.

1004
01:06:36,659 --> 01:06:37,911
Mom, it's not your fault.

1005
01:06:37,994 --> 01:06:39,370
It is my fault.

1006
01:06:41,706 --> 01:06:43,875
Stefani, you were only wrong
about the order

1007
01:06:43,958 --> 01:06:45,752
because there is something
you didn't know.

1008
01:06:50,548 --> 01:06:53,801
Erik isn't Howard's biological son.

1009
01:06:56,888 --> 01:06:58,973
I'm sorry. What are you talking about?

1010
01:06:59,057 --> 01:07:00,892
And Stefani, I didn't believe you,

1011
01:07:00,975 --> 01:07:04,354
so I didn't say anything to you,
and now my little girl is dead.

1012
01:07:04,437 --> 01:07:06,231
I don't understand.
What, you had an affair?

1013
01:07:06,814 --> 01:07:09,526
Your father and I were
having such a hard time...

1014
01:07:10,401 --> 01:07:12,987
but it was good because I got you.
I got you out of it.

1015
01:07:13,071 --> 01:07:14,405
Who's my real dad then?
Who's my real dad?

1016
01:07:14,489 --> 01:07:17,116
It doesn't matter
because Howard loved you so, so much.

1017
01:07:17,200 --> 01:07:18,201
Who is it?

1018
01:07:20,411 --> 01:07:21,454
Who's my real dad?

1019
01:07:24,916 --> 01:07:25,917
Jerry Fenbury.

1020
01:07:28,545 --> 01:07:29,963
Jerry Fenbury?

1021
01:07:30,046 --> 01:07:31,339
Yes.

1022
01:07:31,422 --> 01:07:32,840
Oh, shit.

1023
01:07:32,924 --> 01:07:34,008
- No, no, no!
- Erik.

1024
01:07:34,092 --> 01:07:35,593
Jerry fucking Fenbury?

1025
01:07:35,677 --> 01:07:37,762
You don't know
what we were going through.

1026
01:07:37,845 --> 01:07:40,431
Oh, God! What, is this why
he always wanted to play catch?

1027
01:07:40,515 --> 01:07:42,016
Oh my God.

1028
01:07:47,480 --> 01:07:48,606
Okay.

1029
01:07:49,482 --> 01:07:53,778
All right, so, that means that
if it's going in the right order that...

1030
01:07:55,154 --> 01:07:56,155
I'm next, right?

1031
01:08:02,954 --> 01:08:04,622
You got to help me, Stef.

1032
01:08:05,707 --> 01:08:08,084
Bobby, I don't...
I don't think that I can.

1033
01:08:08,167 --> 01:08:10,295
I mean, I thought I did,
but I don't know...

1034
01:08:10,378 --> 01:08:12,839
No. But you can.

1035
01:08:14,215 --> 01:08:16,801
I mean, you predicted
exactly what was going to happen.

1036
01:08:18,303 --> 01:08:19,387
You just got the order wrong

1037
01:08:19,470 --> 01:08:20,805
because you didn't
have all the information.

1038
01:08:20,888 --> 01:08:22,849
- Charlie.
- What do you mean "predicted"?

1039
01:08:23,600 --> 01:08:25,518
She saw everything.

1040
01:08:25,602 --> 01:08:28,688
The trimmer, the blower,
the soccer ball.

1041
01:08:28,771 --> 01:08:32,317
It was like they were pieces to a puzzle
and she just had to put them together.

1042
01:08:32,400 --> 01:08:33,901
- You know what I mean?
- Is that true?

1043
01:08:33,985 --> 01:08:35,194
Darlene, please.

1044
01:08:35,278 --> 01:08:37,780
- Do not encourage this.
- Marty.

1045
01:08:37,864 --> 01:08:39,282
I mean...

1046
01:08:40,158 --> 01:08:42,827
I mean,
it's everything in Iris's book. It's...

1047
01:08:42,910 --> 01:08:45,830
It's like an equation. It's math.

1048
01:08:45,913 --> 01:08:48,875
Stefani, if you can see
how all of this fits together,

1049
01:08:48,958 --> 01:08:50,209
we might have a chance.

1050
01:08:50,293 --> 01:08:51,794
Stop. Just stop.

1051
01:08:52,920 --> 01:08:55,548
You devastated this family
when you walked out.

1052
01:08:55,632 --> 01:08:57,800
But we've been okay without you.

1053
01:08:57,884 --> 01:09:01,137
I'm begging you
not to traumatize our kids anymore.

1054
01:09:01,929 --> 01:09:03,181
It's real this time.

1055
01:09:07,769 --> 01:09:09,687
I'm going for a walk.

1056
01:09:10,271 --> 01:09:11,314
I need some air.

1057
01:09:16,611 --> 01:09:18,946
I can appreciate that

1058
01:09:19,030 --> 01:09:22,033
our family is clearly going to need
some counseling in the future,

1059
01:09:22,116 --> 01:09:26,371
but can we focus on the fact
that we're all about to die, right?

1060
01:09:26,454 --> 01:09:29,082
I mean... I mean, Stef,

1061
01:09:29,165 --> 01:09:32,168
didn't you say that... that Iris...

1062
01:09:32,251 --> 01:09:34,504
knew someone
that cheated death or something?

1063
01:09:34,587 --> 01:09:35,713
Yeah, um...

1064
01:09:37,048 --> 01:09:40,134
In here, somewhere, it says...

1065
01:09:41,886 --> 01:09:43,888
that, uh... Right here.

1066
01:09:43,971 --> 01:09:45,723
"JB found someone who survived."

1067
01:09:45,807 --> 01:09:49,102
But it doesn't say anything
about who this JB was or...

1068
01:09:49,185 --> 01:09:51,104
Wait a minute. I know that name.

1069
01:09:51,187 --> 01:09:52,730
My mom used to write me letters,

1070
01:09:52,814 --> 01:09:56,067
and she sometimes would talk
about a friend of hers named JB

1071
01:09:56,150 --> 01:09:58,236
who worked at a hospital.

1072
01:09:58,319 --> 01:09:59,404
Hospital.

1073
01:09:59,487 --> 01:10:00,988
Um... um...

1074
01:10:01,072 --> 01:10:04,242
Something, uh...
Something River Hospital.

1075
01:10:04,325 --> 01:10:05,827
Uh, Deep River.

1076
01:10:05,910 --> 01:10:08,621
Uh, Peace River Hospital. Clear River...

1077
01:10:08,705 --> 01:10:10,665
- Hope River?
- That's it!

1078
01:10:11,374 --> 01:10:12,875
Shit, it's like an hour away.

1079
01:10:12,959 --> 01:10:15,420
I'm going. I'm going to go find him
and talk to him myself.

1080
01:10:15,503 --> 01:10:16,838
Well, I'm coming with you.

1081
01:10:16,921 --> 01:10:19,382
- Me too.
- Okay. Yeah, yeah, let's go.

1082
01:10:21,342 --> 01:10:22,427
Bobby, uh...

1083
01:10:22,510 --> 01:10:24,095
What?

1084
01:10:24,178 --> 01:10:26,514
You need to stay here with your mom.
It's safer.

1085
01:10:26,597 --> 01:10:28,391
Yeah, fuck that.

1086
01:10:28,474 --> 01:10:30,476
Are you kidding me?
I'm not staying here by myself.

1087
01:10:30,560 --> 01:10:32,687
Well, it's too dangerous
on the road for you. You can't.

1088
01:10:32,770 --> 01:10:36,149
No, I read Gammy's Death Book, okay?
All right?

1089
01:10:36,232 --> 01:10:40,153
I mean, there's like a thousand
house-related deaths in that thing, man.

1090
01:10:40,236 --> 01:10:42,029
You can trip down the stairs,

1091
01:10:42,113 --> 01:10:45,074
fall down a toilet or something.

1092
01:10:45,158 --> 01:10:47,869
I don't know, but I'm not...
No way. I'm not staying here.

1093
01:10:49,704 --> 01:10:51,497
- Hang on, hang on.
- Hey, okay.

1094
01:10:51,581 --> 01:10:52,582
- Okay.
- Too fast.

1095
01:10:52,665 --> 01:10:53,958
Okay, okay.
We'll go slow. We'll go slow.

1096
01:10:54,041 --> 01:10:55,126
I'm going to go open up the truck.

1097
01:10:55,209 --> 01:10:56,586
- Charlie, check the back.
- Got it.

1098
01:10:56,669 --> 01:10:57,545
Okay.

1099
01:11:02,049 --> 01:11:03,843
Be careful.
The step's slippery sometimes.

1100
01:11:03,926 --> 01:11:05,136
Oi!

1101
01:11:07,138 --> 01:11:09,056
Any of you fuckers do a nut check?

1102
01:11:10,016 --> 01:11:10,975
Excuse me?

1103
01:11:11,058 --> 01:11:12,518
You made cookies in that thing

1104
01:11:12,602 --> 01:11:14,187
with peanut butter in them
just a few days ago.

1105
01:11:15,438 --> 01:11:17,982
This poor bastard
so much as even touches a nut,

1106
01:11:18,065 --> 01:11:19,776
his throat is going to close up
tighter than...

1107
01:11:20,693 --> 01:11:22,487
You understand.
Where's the peanut butter?

1108
01:11:22,570 --> 01:11:24,864
- Cabinet above the sink.
- Thank you.

1109
01:11:26,199 --> 01:11:28,159
I'm so sorry, Bobby. I just...

1110
01:11:29,118 --> 01:11:30,119
Yeah.

1111
01:11:30,953 --> 01:11:32,079
Hey. Okay.

1112
01:11:34,999 --> 01:11:36,250
All clear.

1113
01:11:36,334 --> 01:11:39,003
Thank you. You're a good brother, Erik.

1114
01:11:39,629 --> 01:11:40,630
- Nut check.
- What?

1115
01:11:40,713 --> 01:11:43,090
- God!
- Stupid.

1116
01:11:45,802 --> 01:11:47,470
It was good. I get it.

1117
01:11:47,553 --> 01:11:48,846
Let's go. Come on.

1118
01:11:48,930 --> 01:11:50,973
It's only going to get worse.

1119
01:11:51,057 --> 01:11:52,058
Goddamn it.

1120
01:11:52,141 --> 01:11:55,269
Wait! I'm coming with you, bro.

1121
01:11:55,353 --> 01:11:57,063
Someone's got to protect you.

1122
01:12:04,737 --> 01:12:07,114
Dad's calling. Again.

1123
01:12:07,198 --> 01:12:08,783
Tell him we just
went for a ride with Mom.

1124
01:12:08,866 --> 01:12:10,159
He's not going to believe that.

1125
01:12:10,243 --> 01:12:12,203
At least it'll buy us some time.

1126
01:12:12,286 --> 01:12:13,287
All right.

1127
01:12:15,706 --> 01:12:17,542
If Death doesn't get us, your dad will.

1128
01:12:30,263 --> 01:12:31,973
I always keep them where I can see them.

1129
01:12:34,892 --> 01:12:36,853
I mean, you could've just
had the real thing,

1130
01:12:36,936 --> 01:12:38,688
but it's okay,
not everyone wants to be a mom.

1131
01:12:41,774 --> 01:12:43,317
Is that what you think?

1132
01:12:43,401 --> 01:12:45,361
That I didn't want to be your mom?

1133
01:12:47,905 --> 01:12:53,327
Look, I was raised by a woman
who taught me to see Death everywhere.

1134
01:12:54,287 --> 01:12:55,788
I thought I could put it behind me,

1135
01:12:55,872 --> 01:12:58,165
but then when I had you
and your brother,

1136
01:12:58,249 --> 01:13:00,668
all I could see were
a hundred different ways

1137
01:13:00,751 --> 01:13:02,712
that you and Charlie could die.

1138
01:13:03,462 --> 01:13:05,548
I didn't want you to leave the house.

1139
01:13:05,631 --> 01:13:08,926
I would freak out on you guys
over nothing.

1140
01:13:10,428 --> 01:13:11,721
One day I looked at your face

1141
01:13:11,804 --> 01:13:15,600
and I saw the same scared little girl
that I was growing up,

1142
01:13:15,683 --> 01:13:18,436
and I knew that if I stayed,
I was going to ruin your life.

1143
01:13:21,105 --> 01:13:23,190
I have no idea if I did the right thing.

1144
01:13:24,650 --> 01:13:25,902
But I'm here for you now.

1145
01:13:50,593 --> 01:13:51,552
It's okay.

1146
01:13:52,386 --> 01:13:53,471
I'm right behind you.

1147
01:14:05,274 --> 01:14:07,568
Hey. Now you see, buddy. We got you.

1148
01:14:07,652 --> 01:14:09,236
The front desk is this way.

1149
01:14:14,742 --> 01:14:19,914
Oh. Hi. We're looking for JB.

1150
01:14:20,748 --> 01:14:21,958
And who are you?

1151
01:14:22,708 --> 01:14:25,419
The front desk told us we could
find him down here. Is that you?

1152
01:14:25,503 --> 01:14:27,838
That would be me.

1153
01:14:37,515 --> 01:14:41,978
William John Bludworth.
But my friends call me JB.

1154
01:14:42,061 --> 01:14:45,564
I've been waiting for you, Stefani.

1155
01:14:45,648 --> 01:14:47,817
Charlie. Darlene.

1156
01:14:47,900 --> 01:14:50,444
But no Howard. No Julia.

1157
01:14:51,570 --> 01:14:54,573
So, which one of you is next?

1158
01:14:58,577 --> 01:14:59,578
Hi.

1159
01:14:59,662 --> 01:15:02,498
I was sorry to hear about Iris.

1160
01:15:02,581 --> 01:15:04,709
She was a special woman.

1161
01:15:05,501 --> 01:15:06,585
How did you know her?

1162
01:15:07,378 --> 01:15:09,088
She saved my life.

1163
01:15:09,964 --> 01:15:10,965
When?

1164
01:15:13,175 --> 01:15:14,760
At the Sky View.

1165
01:15:19,765 --> 01:15:22,309
<i>My mother brought me
with her to work that night.</i>

1166
01:15:22,393 --> 01:15:23,978
JB, honey, I told you,

1167
01:15:24,061 --> 01:15:26,313
you got to stay back there
while I'm on stage.

1168
01:15:26,397 --> 01:15:28,065
<i>I wasn't
supposed to be there,</i>

1169
01:15:28,149 --> 01:15:30,609
<i>except, of course, to die.</i>

1170
01:15:30,693 --> 01:15:32,611
- ♪ <i>You know you make me wanna</i> ♪
- ♪ <i>Shout</i> ♪

1171
01:15:32,695 --> 01:15:34,321
- ♪ <i>Kick my heels up and</i> ♪
- ♪ <i>Shout</i> ♪

1172
01:15:34,405 --> 01:15:37,158
- ♪ <i>Throw my hands up and</i> ♪
- Stop playing! Stop playing!

1173
01:15:37,241 --> 01:15:39,493
<i>Everyone needs to get off
the dance floor!</i>

1174
01:15:39,577 --> 01:15:41,912
<i>The glass is about to break.
Everyone needs to get off now!</i>

1175
01:15:41,996 --> 01:15:43,330
Wait! No!

1176
01:15:43,414 --> 01:15:44,790
Iris!

1177
01:15:55,051 --> 01:15:56,969
You were the last to die.
You were the little boy.

1178
01:15:58,971 --> 01:16:00,097
Correct.

1179
01:16:00,181 --> 01:16:01,474
So, all that time,

1180
01:16:01,557 --> 01:16:04,477
she wasn't just protecting our family,

1181
01:16:04,560 --> 01:16:06,020
she was protecting you too.

1182
01:16:07,104 --> 01:16:09,732
Years later, she tracked me down.

1183
01:16:09,815 --> 01:16:12,109
Helped me see the truth.

1184
01:16:12,193 --> 01:16:14,111
We traded ideas.

1185
01:16:14,195 --> 01:16:16,697
I helped her fortify her cabin.

1186
01:16:16,781 --> 01:16:18,324
We became friends.

1187
01:16:18,908 --> 01:16:22,661
I even helped her
get the best medical care I could,

1188
01:16:22,745 --> 01:16:24,371
considering her condition.

1189
01:16:24,455 --> 01:16:28,125
Iris said that you found somebody
who stopped Death and survived.

1190
01:16:28,209 --> 01:16:29,627
Yes.

1191
01:16:29,710 --> 01:16:32,213
Uh, and how do we do that?

1192
01:16:32,296 --> 01:16:34,215
There are only two ways.

1193
01:16:34,298 --> 01:16:37,510
By killing or by dying.

1194
01:16:37,593 --> 01:16:41,889
If you take a life,
you get the time that person had left.

1195
01:16:41,972 --> 01:16:44,558
What? No!
I... I'm not going to kill someone.

1196
01:16:44,642 --> 01:16:46,268
Maybe we should let the guy finish.

1197
01:16:46,352 --> 01:16:50,106
And to truly break the cycle,
you have to die.

1198
01:16:50,189 --> 01:16:52,483
What... What does that mean?

1199
01:16:53,484 --> 01:16:57,738
A long time ago,
a young woman named Kimberly Corman

1200
01:16:57,822 --> 01:16:59,907
found herself on Death's list.

1201
01:16:59,990 --> 01:17:01,951
Just like you.

1202
01:17:02,034 --> 01:17:05,746
And when her turn finally came,
she died.

1203
01:17:05,830 --> 01:17:06,956
Flatlined.

1204
01:17:07,039 --> 01:17:09,500
But her doctor managed
to bring her back,

1205
01:17:09,583 --> 01:17:12,294
and that broke the chain.

1206
01:17:12,378 --> 01:17:14,880
- All right, then. We'll do that.
- What are you talking about?

1207
01:17:16,715 --> 01:17:18,676
Why didn't Iris try that?

1208
01:17:18,759 --> 01:17:19,927
It's risky.

1209
01:17:20,010 --> 01:17:23,347
And if you fuck with Death and lose,

1210
01:17:23,430 --> 01:17:26,725
things can get very messy.

1211
01:17:29,353 --> 01:17:32,898
Wait. Hang on, hang on. Okay, wait. No.

1212
01:17:32,982 --> 01:17:35,484
There has to be another way.
Please, you have to help us.

1213
01:17:36,235 --> 01:17:39,530
For years, people have been
coming to me for advice.

1214
01:17:40,489 --> 01:17:43,993
Well, I'm tired. I'm done with all that.

1215
01:17:44,076 --> 01:17:46,245
And now, I'm sick just like Iris.

1216
01:17:46,328 --> 01:17:48,873
There's no running this time.

1217
01:17:48,956 --> 01:17:52,710
Fact is, you're all going to die.

1218
01:17:52,793 --> 01:17:55,629
And after that, I will too.

1219
01:17:59,383 --> 01:18:02,261
Now that my old friend is gone,
I'm retiring.

1220
01:18:02,344 --> 01:18:04,054
So, what,
you're just gonna leave us here?

1221
01:18:04,138 --> 01:18:05,890
- Wait, wait, wait!
- Dude, we need your help.

1222
01:18:05,973 --> 01:18:07,057
Where are you going?

1223
01:18:07,141 --> 01:18:10,811
I intend to enjoy the time I have left.

1224
01:18:11,395 --> 01:18:14,899
And I suggest that you do the same.

1225
01:18:14,982 --> 01:18:16,567
Life is precious.

1226
01:18:18,402 --> 01:18:20,654
Enjoy every single second.

1227
01:18:21,739 --> 01:18:23,199
You never know when.

1228
01:18:29,038 --> 01:18:30,122
Good luck.

1229
01:18:36,003 --> 01:18:37,421
Well, that's fantastic.

1230
01:18:38,422 --> 01:18:40,382
- No. No.
- Bobby.

1231
01:18:40,466 --> 01:18:44,094
No, that... that can't be it.
No. No, there...

1232
01:18:44,178 --> 01:18:47,264
There has to be something here.
There has to be another answer.

1233
01:18:47,348 --> 01:18:51,769
Stef. Stef. Stef, he gave us an answer.

1234
01:18:51,852 --> 01:18:53,479
Bobby's got to die.

1235
01:18:53,562 --> 01:18:54,521
Erik!

1236
01:18:54,605 --> 01:18:57,149
Are you fucking insane?
We're not killing Bobby!

1237
01:18:57,233 --> 01:18:59,860
Whoa, whoa, am I the only guy
that just listened to that dude?

1238
01:18:59,944 --> 01:19:00,861
There's only one way.

1239
01:19:00,945 --> 01:19:02,863
We kill Bobby, we resuscitate him,

1240
01:19:02,947 --> 01:19:04,907
and then boom,
you're all off Death's list.

1241
01:19:04,990 --> 01:19:05,908
Congratulations.

1242
01:19:05,991 --> 01:19:07,493
There has to be something else, right?

1243
01:19:07,576 --> 01:19:09,870
I mean, there has to be
another solution, right, Stef?

1244
01:19:11,080 --> 01:19:12,081
No.

1245
01:19:12,957 --> 01:19:15,251
No, there's...
there's nothing else we can do, okay?

1246
01:19:15,334 --> 01:19:16,335
It's over.

1247
01:19:17,670 --> 01:19:18,921
Hey.

1248
01:19:19,004 --> 01:19:20,339
Stefani, listen to me.

1249
01:19:20,422 --> 01:19:21,966
You got to trust me on this one, okay?

1250
01:19:22,049 --> 01:19:24,260
She's giving up on you,
I'm not going to.

1251
01:19:24,343 --> 01:19:27,972
Look, Iris found a way
to hold Death off for decades.

1252
01:19:30,599 --> 01:19:32,268
- So will we.
- I trust that guy.

1253
01:19:32,351 --> 01:19:33,560
You trust that guy?

1254
01:19:33,644 --> 01:19:34,979
- He was...
- This one that...

1255
01:19:35,062 --> 01:19:38,607
He was awfully charismatic,
and you know that as well as I do...

1256
01:19:50,202 --> 01:19:51,328
Uh...

1257
01:19:52,162 --> 01:19:53,872
Erik and Bobby are gone.

1258
01:19:54,790 --> 01:19:56,625
Shit. Shit!

1259
01:19:58,294 --> 01:19:59,295
I don't think I like this.

1260
01:19:59,378 --> 01:20:01,255
Hey, dude,
we're in a hospital, remember?

1261
01:20:01,338 --> 01:20:02,464
There's doctors everywhere.

1262
01:20:02,548 --> 01:20:04,591
We kill you, they bring you back,

1263
01:20:04,675 --> 01:20:07,094
everybody's safe, we're heroes.

1264
01:20:07,177 --> 01:20:09,471
Dude, that is literally
the opposite of keeping me safe.

1265
01:20:09,555 --> 01:20:10,764
What's the alternative, huh?

1266
01:20:11,682 --> 01:20:13,976
You want to kill someone,
take the time they have left?

1267
01:20:14,893 --> 01:20:17,187
How? How do you even know
how many years they have?

1268
01:20:24,737 --> 01:20:26,613
- No. No.
- No. Not good with that.

1269
01:20:28,866 --> 01:20:30,075
- Well, I mean...
- No.

1270
01:20:30,159 --> 01:20:31,994
- No, of course not.
- We wouldn't do that.

1271
01:20:32,077 --> 01:20:34,204
- No, we would never.
- Don't touch those babies.

1272
01:20:34,288 --> 01:20:36,415
Look, bottom line...

1273
01:20:36,498 --> 01:20:38,250
...flatlining is your best option.

1274
01:20:39,209 --> 01:20:40,836
What do you have to lose?

1275
01:20:43,756 --> 01:20:45,257
- Okay.
- Okay.

1276
01:20:45,341 --> 01:20:47,593
All right, how would we even do that?

1277
01:20:47,676 --> 01:20:49,219
Well, see, I've got an idea.

1278
01:20:51,096 --> 01:20:52,348
But it's a little nuts.

1279
01:20:58,604 --> 01:21:00,105
Your allergy is deadly, right?

1280
01:21:01,774 --> 01:21:02,691
Yeah.

1281
01:21:03,984 --> 01:21:04,985
Well...

1282
01:21:09,990 --> 01:21:11,367
Hey, dude, wait.

1283
01:21:11,450 --> 01:21:14,578
No, look, all right? If I'm going out,
it's not going to be on those...

1284
01:21:14,661 --> 01:21:16,789
what, unsalted bitches, all right?

1285
01:21:17,956 --> 01:21:19,041
Give me those.

1286
01:21:21,293 --> 01:21:22,252
Nice choice.

1287
01:21:32,137 --> 01:21:33,972
Oh, you got to be kidding me. Come on!

1288
01:21:34,807 --> 01:21:35,766
- Hey.
- Stupid!

1289
01:21:35,849 --> 01:21:37,309
- All right.
- Come on!

1290
01:21:37,393 --> 01:21:39,478
You know, maybe this is a sign,
so we can just...

1291
01:21:41,188 --> 01:21:44,274
Okay. Hey, dude,
maybe we can just bail now.

1292
01:21:44,358 --> 01:21:45,692
No, I'm not giving up.

1293
01:21:49,655 --> 01:21:51,407
- What the hell?
- Can you help?

1294
01:21:51,490 --> 01:21:53,742
It's all right. We work here.

1295
01:21:53,826 --> 01:21:56,161
Maintenance. It's fine.
Put your headphones back on.

1296
01:21:56,245 --> 01:21:58,622
Dude, it's going to fall.
It's going to fall.

1297
01:22:00,290 --> 01:22:02,167
- Oh, my! It's falling!
- Did you get it out?

1298
01:22:02,251 --> 01:22:04,336
I can't hold it!
It's going to fall!

1299
01:22:09,800 --> 01:22:11,009
Easy work.

1300
01:22:12,553 --> 01:22:13,720
Now what?

1301
01:22:14,930 --> 01:22:16,140
Come with me. Come with me.

1302
01:22:17,933 --> 01:22:18,934
What?

1303
01:22:20,394 --> 01:22:21,854
Hey, hang here.
I got to get something.

1304
01:22:23,397 --> 01:22:24,690
- Wha...
- Don't move.

1305
01:22:24,773 --> 01:22:25,858
What are you talk...

1306
01:22:33,532 --> 01:22:35,659
Okay. Don't move.

1307
01:23:13,363 --> 01:23:15,949
No, that's... that's cool.

1308
01:23:16,033 --> 01:23:17,826
I searched the bathrooms.
They weren't in the RV?

1309
01:23:17,910 --> 01:23:19,786
No. Look,
if Erik was trying to kill Bobby,

1310
01:23:19,870 --> 01:23:20,913
where would they be?

1311
01:23:20,996 --> 01:23:23,373
I don't know, but there's a million ways
to die in a hospital.

1312
01:23:23,457 --> 01:23:25,751
Can I help you? Excuse me.

1313
01:23:26,627 --> 01:23:29,338
No, uh... just here to see my Nana.

1314
01:23:34,051 --> 01:23:35,427
Lovely day today.

1315
01:23:35,511 --> 01:23:37,012
Got much time left?

1316
01:23:40,182 --> 01:23:41,391
I think so.

1317
01:23:41,475 --> 01:23:44,186
<i>Be sure to remove
all metallic belongings and devices</i>

1318
01:23:44,269 --> 01:23:46,688
<i>that could interact
with the MRI's powerful magnet.</i>

1319
01:23:49,233 --> 01:23:51,735
- Hey, dude, Charlie's trying to call...
- Here, man, give me that.

1320
01:23:51,818 --> 01:23:53,904
Here, come on. Sit down. Sit, sit, sit.

1321
01:23:53,987 --> 01:23:55,781
What the hell?
No, I'm not sitting in that.

1322
01:23:55,864 --> 01:23:57,032
Well, I've got a great idea.

1323
01:23:57,115 --> 01:23:59,701
Okay, there's an ER down the hall.
So, as soon as you flat line, boom.

1324
01:23:59,785 --> 01:24:00,953
I'm going to wheel your ass down there

1325
01:24:01,036 --> 01:24:02,287
and they're going to
bring you right back.

1326
01:24:02,371 --> 01:24:03,872
Hey, where's your EpiPen?

1327
01:24:03,956 --> 01:24:05,832
- Uh, it's right here.
- Give it to me.

1328
01:24:05,916 --> 01:24:07,000
Why?

1329
01:24:09,461 --> 01:24:11,046
- What is that?
- Dude, give it.

1330
01:24:11,129 --> 01:24:14,424
Give it. Listen, the whole idea
is you have to die.

1331
01:24:14,508 --> 01:24:16,718
Remember, this keeps you alive. Now sit.

1332
01:24:18,387 --> 01:24:20,556
- Dude, we need to hurry. Come on. Go.
- All right, all right.

1333
01:24:21,640 --> 01:24:22,933
All right, eat up.

1334
01:24:24,059 --> 01:24:25,060
Hey, man, um...

1335
01:24:28,897 --> 01:24:32,150
The plan's great,
but you know, if it doesn't work out...

1336
01:24:32,234 --> 01:24:33,860
It's going to work, Bobby.

1337
01:24:33,944 --> 01:24:35,279
Yeah.

1338
01:24:35,362 --> 01:24:39,908
Yeah, but you know, just in case,
and I die for real...

1339
01:24:42,411 --> 01:24:43,662
will you just, um...

1340
01:24:45,122 --> 01:24:46,915
Will you look after Paco?

1341
01:24:47,916 --> 01:24:49,251
Yeah, yeah, of course I'll look after...

1342
01:24:49,334 --> 01:24:52,421
Dude, I'm just saying,
turtles live to be like 100 years old,

1343
01:24:52,504 --> 01:24:53,672
and it's a lifetime commitment.

1344
01:24:53,755 --> 01:24:54,840
Look at me. Look at me.

1345
01:24:55,632 --> 01:24:57,134
Brother, I'm not going
to take care of Paco

1346
01:24:57,217 --> 01:24:58,802
because you are going to be okay.

1347
01:24:58,885 --> 01:24:59,886
Me and you?

1348
01:24:59,970 --> 01:25:02,848
We are going to fix things
for everyone right now.

1349
01:25:06,602 --> 01:25:07,603
Look at me.

1350
01:25:09,521 --> 01:25:11,565
I promise you
I'm not going to let you die.

1351
01:25:13,150 --> 01:25:15,444
Technically, I'm going to let you die,
but I'm going to bring you back.

1352
01:25:15,527 --> 01:25:17,487
- Dude, it's not funny.
- I'm just fucking with you.

1353
01:25:18,697 --> 01:25:19,906
Come on.

1354
01:25:20,866 --> 01:25:21,992
You got this.

1355
01:25:51,772 --> 01:25:52,731
Oh my God.

1356
01:25:53,440 --> 01:25:54,441
What?

1357
01:25:55,692 --> 01:25:56,610
That's really good.

1358
01:25:56,693 --> 01:25:57,694
It's very good, I know.

1359
01:25:57,778 --> 01:26:00,238
So, what, okay, other than good,
what are you feeling?

1360
01:26:03,492 --> 01:26:04,451
Nothing.

1361
01:26:05,243 --> 01:26:06,203
You got to be kidding me.

1362
01:26:06,286 --> 01:26:07,871
What, are you telling me
you're not allergic anymore?

1363
01:26:07,954 --> 01:26:09,665
- I don't know, man.
- That's just perfect, isn't it?

1364
01:26:09,748 --> 01:26:13,293
- Maybe I grew out of it.
- What, grew out of it? Fuck!

1365
01:26:13,377 --> 01:26:15,462
You know, I don't have a plan B exactly.

1366
01:26:20,676 --> 01:26:22,469
Hey, you're doing it.
Yeah, yeah, you're doing it.

1367
01:26:22,552 --> 01:26:24,388
Bobby, you're doing it.

1368
01:26:24,471 --> 01:26:25,597
Hey, I'm here with you.

1369
01:26:26,264 --> 01:26:27,599
I'm here with you.

1370
01:26:27,683 --> 01:26:29,434
Hey, hey. I can't give you that, okay?

1371
01:26:30,185 --> 01:26:32,104
Bobby, Bobby. Hey.

1372
01:26:32,187 --> 01:26:33,522
Hey!

1373
01:26:33,605 --> 01:26:34,606
Please.

1374
01:26:34,690 --> 01:26:36,483
Bobby, this is all part of the plan.

1375
01:26:36,566 --> 01:26:38,902
Just calm down.

1376
01:26:38,985 --> 01:26:40,487
Bobby, in the wheelchair!

1377
01:26:44,241 --> 01:26:45,575
Try calling them again.

1378
01:26:47,703 --> 01:26:49,496
This is the only way we can do...

1379
01:27:05,929 --> 01:27:08,265
Aah! Fuck!

1380
01:28:34,976 --> 01:28:37,270
Oh my God. Are you okay?

1381
01:28:38,063 --> 01:28:39,231
Yeah.

1382
01:29:09,678 --> 01:29:13,139
Why... Why is Erik dead
if he's not related to Iris?

1383
01:29:19,479 --> 01:29:21,773
When you fuck with Death,
things get messy.

1384
01:29:26,444 --> 01:29:28,113
We have to get out of here.

1385
01:29:29,990 --> 01:29:31,074
It's not safe.

1386
01:29:32,617 --> 01:29:33,785
And go where?

1387
01:29:34,953 --> 01:29:35,996
Nowhere is safe.

1388
01:29:38,957 --> 01:29:40,417
Except Iris' cabin.

1389
01:29:43,211 --> 01:29:46,047
She was able to survive there
for decades.

1390
01:29:46,131 --> 01:29:47,632
Yeah, and then she got
her face blown off.

1391
01:29:47,716 --> 01:29:49,676
She only died
because she left the cabin.

1392
01:29:50,886 --> 01:29:52,304
Outside is dangerous,

1393
01:29:52,387 --> 01:29:54,514
but inside is the safest place
that there is.

1394
01:29:56,725 --> 01:29:57,809
You're right.

1395
01:29:58,852 --> 01:30:01,646
It's the only place
where we have any advantage.

1396
01:30:02,731 --> 01:30:06,318
So... So we just lock ourselves
in a cabin forever?

1397
01:30:11,197 --> 01:30:12,365
Not you.

1398
01:30:14,284 --> 01:30:15,243
Me.

1399
01:30:16,202 --> 01:30:19,122
Mom, you can't leave.
We just got you back.

1400
01:30:19,205 --> 01:30:22,626
If anybody's going to live
in that cabin, it's me.

1401
01:30:23,335 --> 01:30:27,672
And as long as I am alive,
Death can't touch you.

1402
01:30:27,756 --> 01:30:28,882
- Mom.
- Let me do this.

1403
01:30:28,965 --> 01:30:31,384
He'll never let you
get there on your own.

1404
01:30:31,468 --> 01:30:32,928
But I can see him coming.

1405
01:30:34,179 --> 01:30:35,847
We have to do this together.

1406
01:30:40,894 --> 01:30:41,895
Okay.

1407
01:30:43,772 --> 01:30:44,773
Okay.

1408
01:30:53,490 --> 01:30:54,699
Let's go.

1409
01:30:58,036 --> 01:30:58,954
Yep.

1410
01:31:00,997 --> 01:31:01,831
Okay.

1411
01:31:06,795 --> 01:31:07,837
Watch out!

1412
01:31:17,555 --> 01:31:19,182
- You should drive.
- Yeah.

1413
01:32:21,494 --> 01:32:22,912
Holy shit.

1414
01:32:24,205 --> 01:32:25,707
Look at this place.

1415
01:32:31,379 --> 01:32:33,715
It's going to be impossible
to get through that gate.

1416
01:32:53,401 --> 01:32:55,111
He's about to make a move.

1417
01:32:55,945 --> 01:32:56,905
I don't know what it is.

1418
01:32:57,489 --> 01:32:59,032
We need to get you inside now.

1419
01:32:59,908 --> 01:33:00,909
Okay.

1420
01:33:01,493 --> 01:33:02,952
Wait. Wait, what?

1421
01:33:14,714 --> 01:33:15,673
Go!

1422
01:33:18,927 --> 01:33:19,928
Stef!

1423
01:33:25,934 --> 01:33:27,227
- Stef!
- Shit!

1424
01:33:38,571 --> 01:33:40,698
Okay. Let's get inside.

1425
01:33:42,325 --> 01:33:43,326
Okay.

1426
01:33:46,788 --> 01:33:48,331
- Shit.
- What?

1427
01:33:55,004 --> 01:33:57,590
- I can help.
- No, no. Don't wait for me.

1428
01:33:57,674 --> 01:33:59,217
- Just get inside.
- Stef.

1429
01:33:59,300 --> 01:34:01,094
If you get inside, I'll be safe. Go.

1430
01:34:01,177 --> 01:34:02,554
Okay. Come on.

1431
01:34:26,494 --> 01:34:27,996
Mom.

1432
01:34:29,247 --> 01:34:30,123
Get down!

1433
01:34:57,609 --> 01:34:58,610
Fuck!

1434
01:35:01,905 --> 01:35:03,740
Mom? Mom!

1435
01:35:09,329 --> 01:35:10,330
Wait.

1436
01:35:24,761 --> 01:35:26,137
Okay, okay.

1437
01:35:49,494 --> 01:35:50,912
Mom? Oh my God.

1438
01:35:52,538 --> 01:35:55,792
Don't worry about me.
Go save your sister.

1439
01:35:58,544 --> 01:35:59,921
I'm going to stay alive as long as...

1440
01:36:14,519 --> 01:36:15,520
Stef!

1441
01:37:13,202 --> 01:37:14,662
No! No!

1442
01:37:33,139 --> 01:37:35,016
Oh my God. Are you okay?

1443
01:37:35,099 --> 01:37:36,476
Yeah.

1444
01:37:37,226 --> 01:37:40,104
Just breathe. Breathe. Breathe.

1445
01:37:42,899 --> 01:37:44,233
How?

1446
01:37:44,317 --> 01:37:46,402
Charlie. What happened?

1447
01:37:47,987 --> 01:37:49,072
You're okay.

1448
01:37:50,990 --> 01:37:53,368
You died, and I brought you back.

1449
01:37:57,246 --> 01:37:58,748
You brought me back.

1450
01:38:01,250 --> 01:38:02,460
We're safe now.

1451
01:38:10,760 --> 01:38:11,677
Mom?

1452
01:38:14,430 --> 01:38:16,682
No. No.

1453
01:38:17,350 --> 01:38:18,559
She saved us.

1454
01:38:35,576 --> 01:38:36,786
Let's go home.

1455
01:39:19,495 --> 01:39:21,038
All right, I'm ready.

1456
01:39:23,541 --> 01:39:24,542
Well, there he is.

1457
01:39:24,625 --> 01:39:26,169
Wow. Okay, Charlie.

1458
01:39:27,086 --> 01:39:28,963
All right. Give us a spin. Mm-hmm.

1459
01:39:29,964 --> 01:39:31,924
Oh. Mm-hmm.

1460
01:39:32,008 --> 01:39:33,593
You look really good.

1461
01:39:34,552 --> 01:39:35,553
I have a great stylist.

1462
01:39:36,387 --> 01:39:38,181
Come on, we're going to be late.

1463
01:39:46,522 --> 01:39:47,523
Where's Jenny?

1464
01:39:49,567 --> 01:39:51,152
I think she's still inside,
getting ready.

1465
01:39:52,320 --> 01:39:53,279
Here, let me fix this.

1466
01:39:55,615 --> 01:39:57,533
I'm really happy
I could be here for this.

1467
01:39:58,618 --> 01:39:59,702
Me too.

1468
01:39:59,785 --> 01:40:01,704
Ow.

1469
01:40:02,705 --> 01:40:03,706
You okay?

1470
01:40:04,957 --> 01:40:05,958
Yeah.

1471
01:40:10,796 --> 01:40:12,215
- Hi.
- Hello.

1472
01:40:13,883 --> 01:40:15,510
Could I have one cookie, please?

1473
01:40:48,125 --> 01:40:49,085
Charlie.

1474
01:40:50,253 --> 01:40:51,671
- Looking sharp.
- Thank you, sir.

1475
01:40:51,754 --> 01:40:54,090
Stef, I want you to meet Jenny's dad,
Dr. Reddick.

1476
01:40:54,173 --> 01:40:55,675
- Hey. Nice to meet you.
- Hi.

1477
01:40:55,758 --> 01:40:56,759
You too.

1478
01:40:56,842 --> 01:40:58,761
We just adore Charlie.

1479
01:40:58,844 --> 01:41:00,513
And I understand
he's quite the lifesaver.

1480
01:41:00,596 --> 01:41:02,265
Oh, yeah. You heard about that.

1481
01:41:02,348 --> 01:41:04,308
He, uh, brought me back from the dead.

1482
01:41:05,476 --> 01:41:06,477
Mmm.

1483
01:41:08,271 --> 01:41:09,480
Huh?

1484
01:41:09,564 --> 01:41:10,565
Yeah.

1485
01:41:11,482 --> 01:41:13,442
- What?
- Well, technically you weren't dead.

1486
01:41:15,361 --> 01:41:16,404
What?

1487
01:41:16,487 --> 01:41:19,490
Well, I mean, if you were unconscious
and Charlie got you breathing again,

1488
01:41:19,574 --> 01:41:21,242
then your heart didn't stop.

1489
01:41:22,201 --> 01:41:23,869
But regardless, way to go, Charlie.

1490
01:41:25,121 --> 01:41:26,914
- So she wasn't dead?
- Exactly.

1491
01:41:31,377 --> 01:41:33,296
She was lucky Charlie was there.

1492
01:41:33,379 --> 01:41:35,339
Yep.
Everything happens for a reason.

1493
01:41:35,423 --> 01:41:36,465
Jenny!

1494
01:41:41,012 --> 01:41:43,598
Sweetie,
you look like a million bucks.

1495
01:41:52,189 --> 01:41:53,524
Stef.

1496
01:41:57,236 --> 01:41:58,696
Run!

1497
01:42:11,834 --> 01:42:13,127
Oh my God, that was close.

1498
01:42:13,210 --> 01:42:14,920
- You okay?
- Yeah.
