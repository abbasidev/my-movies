1
00:00:38,791 --> 00:00:40,625
<i>Hard to know where to start.</i>

2
00:00:41,833 --> 00:00:45,167
<i>I guess to tell the story
of the Good Friday murder through my eyes,</i>

3
00:00:45,250 --> 00:00:46,958
<i>I got to start here.</i>

4
00:00:47,625 --> 00:00:51,667
<i>Nine months ago, when this asshole deacon
said something way out of line,</i>

5
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:52,958
<i>and I did this.</i>

6
00:00:58,333 --> 00:00:59,958
Oh, shit.

7
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:03,083
So, you're a fighter, then?

8
00:01:03,583 --> 00:01:05,625
Uh, no, Father, absolutely not.

9
00:01:05,708 --> 00:01:08,958
Well, we have a deacon who would say
otherwise if his jaw wasn't broken.

10
00:01:09,041 --> 00:01:11,750
In my previous life, yes, I was a boxer,

11
00:01:12,250 --> 00:01:14,750
and I lived on the streets.
I did some other things.

12
00:01:14,833 --> 00:01:18,708
We need fighters today,
but to fight the world,

13
00:01:19,458 --> 00:01:21,000
not ourselves.

14
00:01:21,083 --> 00:01:24,542
A priest is a shepherd.
The world is a wolf.

15
00:01:24,625 --> 00:01:25,833
No.

16
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:33,542
I... I don't believe that,
Father, respectfully.

17
00:01:33,625 --> 00:01:36,417
You start fighting wolves,
and before you know it,

18
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:38,451
everyone you don't understand is a wolf.

19
00:01:39,333 --> 00:01:42,250
I still got that fighting instinct,
and I gave into it today,

20
00:01:42,333 --> 00:01:44,750
but Christ came to heal the world,
not fight it.

21
00:01:44,833 --> 00:01:46,125
I believe that.

22
00:01:46,208 --> 00:01:49,583
It's this, not this, you know?

23
00:01:50,833 --> 00:01:52,666
I just want to be a good priest.

24
00:01:53,625 --> 00:01:56,833
Show broken people like me
the forgiveness and love of Christ.

25
00:01:56,916 --> 00:01:59,000
The world needs that so bad.

26
00:02:01,708 --> 00:02:04,583
You give me one more shot,
and I promise I'll do that.

27
00:02:16,875 --> 00:02:18,125
Your Excellency,

28
00:02:18,833 --> 00:02:20,958
you stuck your neck out for me
so many times.

29
00:02:21,041 --> 00:02:23,542
-I let you down, and whatever the...
-All right.

30
00:02:23,625 --> 00:02:24,791
Listen...

31
00:02:25,291 --> 00:02:28,167
Deacon Clark is famously a dick.

32
00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:30,708
Nobody's actually that upset
that you clocked him.

33
00:02:30,791 --> 00:02:32,292
In fact, kind of the opposite.

34
00:02:32,375 --> 00:02:35,041
But we do need to do something about it.

35
00:02:36,041 --> 00:02:39,167
We're sending you
to a small parish in Chimney Rock.

36
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:42,292
It's just one priest there now.

37
00:02:43,583 --> 00:02:44,917
Assistant pastor?

38
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,167
Yeah, well, curb your enthusiasm.

39
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:48,166
What?

40
00:02:48,666 --> 00:02:53,333
You're going
to Our Lady of Perpetual Fortitude,

41
00:02:53,416 --> 00:02:56,684
led by Monsignor Jefferson Wicks.
Have you heard of Jefferson Wicks?

42
00:02:57,458 --> 00:03:00,875
Okay, look, Wicks has his supporters here.
I'm not one of them.

43
00:03:00,958 --> 00:03:02,042
Between you and me,

44
00:03:02,125 --> 00:03:05,083
I think he's a few beads shy of
a full rosary and a real son of a bitch.

45
00:03:06,083 --> 00:03:10,833
But what's undeniable is that his flock
is shrinking and even calcifying.

46
00:03:11,791 --> 00:03:15,333
It could use some of what
you said in there. You understand?

47
00:03:15,958 --> 00:03:18,208
Not at all, but yes.

48
00:03:18,291 --> 00:03:20,375
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

49
00:03:20,458 --> 00:03:23,333
-Spirit's got me. Let me at him.
-Hey. Hey, hey.

50
00:03:23,416 --> 00:03:27,041
This, not this, right? Mm?

51
00:03:31,166 --> 00:03:32,375
Good luck, kid.

52
00:03:38,166 --> 00:03:40,791
<i>So, that's how I came
to Chimney Rock.</i>

53
00:03:43,333 --> 00:03:45,083
<i>Daniel in the lion's den.</i>

54
00:03:45,166 --> 00:03:47,000
<i>David facing off Goliath.</i>

55
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:49,833
<i>Young, dumb, and full of Christ.</i>

56
00:03:49,916 --> 00:03:51,667
<i>Ready for anything.</i>

57
00:04:23,791 --> 00:04:24,875
Father Jefferson?

58
00:04:25,791 --> 00:04:28,000
Hello. Jud Duplenticy from Albany?

59
00:04:28,083 --> 00:04:30,875
Lord be with you,
Jud Duplenticy from Albany.

60
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,125
You here to take my church away from me?

61
00:04:37,458 --> 00:04:39,250
Oh. No.

62
00:04:39,833 --> 00:04:40,708
Good.

63
00:04:41,583 --> 00:04:44,000
Okay, call me Monsignor Wicks.

64
00:04:44,916 --> 00:04:46,208
I see you've met Martha.

65
00:04:47,083 --> 00:04:48,250
Martha? No.

66
00:04:48,333 --> 00:04:49,833
-Monsignor Wicks.
-Jesus!

67
00:04:49,916 --> 00:04:52,417
I woke up early to polish the silver.

68
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:53,792
It was a bit blotchy.

69
00:04:53,875 --> 00:04:55,417
That'll be fine, Martha.

70
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:57,791
Father... Jud.

71
00:04:59,083 --> 00:05:00,375
You are welcome here.

72
00:05:00,875 --> 00:05:02,417
-Thank you, Martha.
-Mm.

73
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:05,125
I was actually
just saying to Father Wicks...

74
00:05:05,208 --> 00:05:06,875
Monsignor Wicks.

75
00:05:07,708 --> 00:05:09,583
Monsignor, right. Sorry.

76
00:05:10,083 --> 00:05:11,708
And sorry for saying "Jesus".

77
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:15,583
Hoo.
This is going great, I think.

78
00:05:15,666 --> 00:05:18,291
-Bishop Langstrom sent you, huh?
-Mm-hmm.

79
00:05:19,166 --> 00:05:20,250
Langstrom.

80
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:22,333
I know him well.

81
00:05:22,416 --> 00:05:24,708
He handpicked you, sent you here.

82
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:27,000
It says something to me.

83
00:05:29,583 --> 00:05:30,791
Tells me a lot.

84
00:05:31,916 --> 00:05:34,708
Well, I... I know
you're used to flying solo, but, um...

85
00:05:35,291 --> 00:05:36,916
I'm... I'm here to serve.

86
00:05:38,416 --> 00:05:39,625
Take my confession.

87
00:05:41,291 --> 00:05:43,083
All right.

88
00:05:43,791 --> 00:05:45,083
Mm.

89
00:05:47,166 --> 00:05:49,625
Bless me, Father, for I have sinned.

90
00:05:49,708 --> 00:05:51,000
It's been, uh,

91
00:05:51,875 --> 00:05:54,291
six weeks since my last confession.

92
00:05:58,708 --> 00:06:01,250
I've envied the material wealth of others.

93
00:06:02,125 --> 00:06:06,750
I saw this luxury car commercial.
Sam had it on his TV. Lexus.

94
00:06:07,416 --> 00:06:08,625
And I thought,

95
00:06:09,125 --> 00:06:11,792
"Ah! That is a good-looking car."

96
00:06:11,875 --> 00:06:13,458
The coupe.

97
00:06:14,583 --> 00:06:17,958
Uh... I've envied the power of great men.

98
00:06:19,375 --> 00:06:22,667
Envied my grandfather's power as a priest.
I wanted that.

99
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:24,041
Always did.

100
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:26,791
Uh...

101
00:06:27,541 --> 00:06:28,958
I've masturbated,

102
00:06:30,166 --> 00:06:33,625
um, four times this week.

103
00:06:33,708 --> 00:06:36,542
Four or five, generally, in...
What'd I say, six weeks?

104
00:06:36,625 --> 00:06:39,791
Well, let's say 30 times, masturbated.

105
00:06:40,833 --> 00:06:44,458
Uh, this week, in my bed,
in the morning once.

106
00:06:44,958 --> 00:06:48,958
Once in the shower, standing up,
which was convenient.

107
00:06:49,041 --> 00:06:51,167
Just use a bath gel.

108
00:06:52,250 --> 00:06:55,458
Oh, once in the middle of the night,
after a dream about...

109
00:06:55,541 --> 00:06:58,125
-That's all right.
-About one of those Japanese cat cafés.

110
00:06:58,208 --> 00:07:00,542
-Okay.
-You know, I read this article,

111
00:07:00,625 --> 00:07:05,916
but the cats were girls,
and, you know, so...

112
00:07:06,583 --> 00:07:07,917
And I hadn't prepared,

113
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,125
so I had to finish into a copy
of <i>Catholic Chronicle</i> magazine,

114
00:07:12,833 --> 00:07:16,916
just what was on the end table,
which is probably its own kind of sin.

115
00:07:17,416 --> 00:07:20,416
I don't know, maybe not, but...
Not good.

116
00:07:21,541 --> 00:07:23,750
<i>At the time,
I thought this was just weird.</i>

117
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:26,833
<i>But looking back now, I know.</i>

118
00:07:26,916 --> 00:07:29,250
<i>This was Wicks' first punch.</i>

119
00:07:29,333 --> 00:07:31,458
Five Hail Marys and one Glory Be.

120
00:07:33,166 --> 00:07:34,458
Thank you, Father.

121
00:07:40,041 --> 00:07:41,458
<i>It wouldn't be his last.</i>

122
00:07:41,541 --> 00:07:42,875
Oh, and welcome

123
00:07:43,666 --> 00:07:45,083
to <i>my</i> church.

124
00:07:48,666 --> 00:07:51,125
<i>Over the next few weeks, I settled in</i>

125
00:07:51,208 --> 00:07:53,500
<i>at Our Lady of Perpetual Fortitude.</i>

126
00:07:59,166 --> 00:08:03,791
<i>The only other full-time employee
was the groundskeeper, Samson.</i>

127
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:05,583
<i>Sam.</i>

128
00:08:11,125 --> 00:08:12,750
<i>It's Monsignor Wicks</i>

129
00:08:12,833 --> 00:08:17,000
who gives me the strength every day
to not go back to the bottle.

130
00:08:17,916 --> 00:08:18,958
He used to drink too.

131
00:08:20,041 --> 00:08:24,083
But he said to me once,
"If I can stave off that demon, you can."

132
00:08:25,375 --> 00:08:27,291
And every day, it is a struggle.

133
00:08:28,166 --> 00:08:29,250
But I have.

134
00:08:30,541 --> 00:08:33,958
I credit him and... my sweet Martha.

135
00:08:34,041 --> 00:08:36,542
Your... your sweet Martha?

136
00:08:36,625 --> 00:08:38,333
I'd do anything for her.

137
00:08:39,708 --> 00:08:42,000
My angel on Earth.

138
00:08:42,083 --> 00:08:45,375
<i>As far as the church goes,
Martha does it all.</i>

139
00:08:45,458 --> 00:08:48,667
<i>She keeps the books,
manages donations, files everything.</i>

140
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:49,958
File that.

141
00:08:50,541 --> 00:08:52,875
<i>She launders the vestments,
stocks the supplies,</i>

142
00:08:52,958 --> 00:08:55,166
<i>feeds Wicks, plays the organ.</i>

143
00:08:58,875 --> 00:09:00,791
<i>She knew where the bodies were buried.</i>

144
00:09:01,583 --> 00:09:03,583
-So this is the crypt?
-Yep.

145
00:09:03,666 --> 00:09:06,708
It's a damn shame.
Gotta put up a security camera.

146
00:09:07,208 --> 00:09:09,333
-Is there an entrance?
-There is.

147
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:11,708
This right here,

148
00:09:12,208 --> 00:09:13,333
it's a Lazarus door.

149
00:09:14,041 --> 00:09:16,833
Takes construction equipment
to open from the outside.

150
00:09:16,916 --> 00:09:19,875
But cantilevered as such that one push

151
00:09:20,458 --> 00:09:22,875
will send it tumbling
to the ground from inside.

152
00:09:24,125 --> 00:09:25,375
Who's in there then?

153
00:09:25,458 --> 00:09:26,541
Prentice.

154
00:09:27,166 --> 00:09:30,625
Wicks' grandfather,
the founder of this church.

155
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:33,000
Was like a father to me.

156
00:09:33,666 --> 00:09:35,583
Makes me sick.

157
00:09:35,666 --> 00:09:40,000
These kids painting rocket ships
all over his sacred resting place.

158
00:09:46,708 --> 00:09:49,416
-What are you doing?
-Oh, uh...

159
00:09:50,208 --> 00:09:52,042
Well, I do a little wood-working,

160
00:09:52,125 --> 00:09:55,625
so thought I could borrow
some of Sam's tools, make a proper...

161
00:09:55,708 --> 00:09:56,917
No, we leave that.

162
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,958
A reminder of the shameful sin
of the harlot whore.

163
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:02,916
Take my confession.

164
00:10:04,875 --> 00:10:06,625
Yes, the harlot whore.

165
00:10:08,125 --> 00:10:09,542
That was Wicks' mother.

166
00:10:09,625 --> 00:10:12,250
Okay, so what's the deal with that?

167
00:10:12,333 --> 00:10:14,625
She was a harlot and a whore.

168
00:10:15,458 --> 00:10:16,208
Okay.

169
00:10:16,291 --> 00:10:19,500
When Prentice entered the priesthood
and founded this church,

170
00:10:19,583 --> 00:10:21,833
he was widowed with a daughter.

171
00:10:22,958 --> 00:10:24,541
Grace was her name.

172
00:10:25,125 --> 00:10:26,667
Always a bad seed.

173
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:32,083
She loved revealing clothes
and her fancy brands.

174
00:10:32,166 --> 00:10:33,792
Fancy brands... Oof.

175
00:10:33,875 --> 00:10:34,958
-Mm.
-Yeah.

176
00:10:35,041 --> 00:10:37,875
As a teenager, she slutted around bars,

177
00:10:37,958 --> 00:10:40,167
was soon pregnant by a drifter.

178
00:10:41,166 --> 00:10:45,208
<i>Prentice had
a vast family fortune in the bank.</i>

179
00:10:45,291 --> 00:10:48,333
<i>To protect his grandson, Wicks,</i>

180
00:10:48,416 --> 00:10:53,083
<i>he promised that
if Grace stayed under his roof,</i>

181
00:10:53,791 --> 00:10:56,916
the fortune would be willed to her.

182
00:10:57,916 --> 00:11:01,750
<i>And so the whore
waited for her father to die.</i>

183
00:11:02,666 --> 00:11:05,000
<i>Oh, it weighed on him heavily.</i>

184
00:11:05,083 --> 00:11:06,666
Martha, remember this.

185
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:10,666
Wealth and the power that comes with it,

186
00:11:11,416 --> 00:11:12,666
is Eve's Apple.

187
00:11:13,916 --> 00:11:16,041
Temptation that leads to the fall.

188
00:11:17,291 --> 00:11:21,125
I must protect our loved ones
from its corrupting influence,

189
00:11:22,208 --> 00:11:23,625
at all costs.

190
00:11:24,375 --> 00:11:26,125
<i>His day came at last.</i>

191
00:11:26,208 --> 00:11:27,541
I was there.

192
00:11:28,625 --> 00:11:31,750
<i>I saw Prentice take his final communion</i>

193
00:11:31,833 --> 00:11:34,583
<i>and die on the holy altar.</i>

194
00:11:34,666 --> 00:11:36,166
<i>At peace.</i>

195
00:11:36,958 --> 00:11:40,458
The harlot whore
went straight to Prentice's attorney.

196
00:11:41,041 --> 00:11:44,125
"Give me my money," she said.

197
00:11:45,375 --> 00:11:46,833
And do you know what he said?

198
00:11:47,958 --> 00:11:52,458
"Yes, you are heir
to every single penny Prentice had."

199
00:11:53,250 --> 00:11:54,875
And in his accounts,

200
00:11:56,166 --> 00:11:59,166
not one hot dime.

201
00:11:59,875 --> 00:12:01,958
Mm, what did he do with the fortune?

202
00:12:02,041 --> 00:12:04,041
Gave it to the poor, say some.

203
00:12:04,666 --> 00:12:07,541
Threw it in the ocean, say others.
No one knows.

204
00:12:08,416 --> 00:12:09,416
It was gone.

205
00:12:10,375 --> 00:12:14,208
That holy man's final act of grace

206
00:12:15,333 --> 00:12:19,625
was to keep the corrupting evil
out of wicked hands.

207
00:12:20,666 --> 00:12:22,500
All that he left her...

208
00:12:25,541 --> 00:12:26,541
{\an8}was this.

209
00:12:27,166 --> 00:12:29,208
{\an8}"What is this?" she said.

210
00:12:30,291 --> 00:12:31,708
But I knew.

211
00:12:32,416 --> 00:12:34,250
Look not for Eve's Apple.

212
00:12:34,916 --> 00:12:38,250
Your inheritance is now Christ.

213
00:12:44,208 --> 00:12:46,833
<i>That night, she had her revenge.</i>

214
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,917
<i>In a demonic rage,</i>

215
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:56,083
<i>she defiled this holy place.</i>

216
00:13:11,416 --> 00:13:13,833
<i>Blasphemy, desecration.</i>

217
00:13:15,416 --> 00:13:18,333
<i>Evil incarnate.</i>

218
00:13:54,083 --> 00:13:56,375
<i>I said, "Sister Grace,</i>"

219
00:13:56,458 --> 00:14:01,458
<i>God, your Father,
will forgive you in His love."</i>

220
00:14:17,958 --> 00:14:19,541
She died,

221
00:14:20,083 --> 00:14:22,292
throwing herself against Prentice's tomb.

222
00:14:25,541 --> 00:14:27,541
<i>Brain aneurysm, they said.</i>

223
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:30,666
Struck down, I say,

224
00:14:31,541 --> 00:14:34,875
by God in His mercy.

225
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:37,500
Holy shit.

226
00:14:39,666 --> 00:14:40,666
Sorry, sorry.

227
00:14:42,916 --> 00:14:46,250
<i>The darkness of that story
was the bedrock of this place.</i>

228
00:14:46,333 --> 00:14:48,583
<i>You could feel it.</i>

229
00:14:48,666 --> 00:14:50,000
And he asked, "Who told you..."

230
00:14:50,083 --> 00:14:54,500
<i>So what would draw someone
to make this their spiritual home?</i>

231
00:14:55,083 --> 00:14:58,000
<i>The core group of regulars
all had their reasons.</i>

232
00:14:58,083 --> 00:15:00,042
<i>And these will be our suspects.</i>

233
00:15:00,125 --> 00:15:01,833
<i>So I should introduce them.</i>

234
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:06,125
{\an8}<i>Vera Draven, local attorney.
She was loyal and devoted.</i>

235
00:15:08,625 --> 00:15:11,875
My dad was
Wicks' attorney and drinking buddy.

236
00:15:11,958 --> 00:15:14,083
The boys.

237
00:15:14,166 --> 00:15:18,542
And so you became a lawyer so you could
take over his family practice?

238
00:15:18,625 --> 00:15:21,845
I became a lawyer because
I wanted to do great things in the world.

239
00:15:23,125 --> 00:15:25,958
But this place is my dad's legacy.

240
00:15:26,708 --> 00:15:27,667
And he wanted me to...

241
00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:30,125
-Thank you.
-...keep it going after he passed.

242
00:15:30,208 --> 00:15:32,625
So here I am.

243
00:15:32,708 --> 00:15:34,542
Yo, yo. Hey, Vera.

244
00:15:34,625 --> 00:15:36,958
-Hi. Oh. Thank you.
-Would you fill this up?

245
00:15:37,041 --> 00:15:39,542
<i>Her adopted son, Cy,
just moved back home</i>

246
00:15:39,625 --> 00:15:42,333
<i>after trying and failing
to get a foothold in politics.</i>

247
00:15:42,416 --> 00:15:43,333
Hi.

248
00:15:43,416 --> 00:15:44,375
Hey.

249
00:15:44,458 --> 00:15:45,625
Okay.

250
00:15:46,666 --> 00:15:48,125
It's nice having him back?

251
00:15:51,416 --> 00:15:54,333
<i>When Vera was young,
just out of law school,</i>

252
00:15:54,416 --> 00:15:58,167
<i>her dad came home
with ten-year-old Cy, out of the blue,</i>

253
00:15:58,250 --> 00:16:00,583
<i>and told Vera she was gonna raise him.</i>

254
00:16:00,666 --> 00:16:02,166
<i>No questions asked.</i>

255
00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:07,416
<i>The whole town knew he was
obviously her illegitimate brother.</i>

256
00:16:08,083 --> 00:16:09,500
<i>But Vera accepted it.</i>

257
00:16:10,458 --> 00:16:11,667
<i>She did it.</i>

258
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:14,333
I've given up a lot to...

259
00:16:14,416 --> 00:16:19,041
...be loyal to my dad
and to Cy and to Wicks.

260
00:16:20,375 --> 00:16:21,625
So I think that

261
00:16:21,708 --> 00:16:25,125
when my dad
is looking down on me from heaven,

262
00:16:25,208 --> 00:16:28,625
I think he is very...

263
00:16:28,708 --> 00:16:30,500
...pleased with me.

264
00:16:32,875 --> 00:16:34,291
So I guess that's nice.

265
00:16:34,958 --> 00:16:35,958
<i>I came this close.</i>

266
00:16:36,041 --> 00:16:38,583
I was the GOP golden boy, the great hope.

267
00:16:38,666 --> 00:16:41,208
I've got connections and ins and outs.

268
00:16:41,291 --> 00:16:43,417
I was on the cusp,
but I just couldn't engage voters.

269
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:47,417
I didn't... have that
cult of personality thing, I guess.

270
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:50,333
It's hard connecting with people
in a genuine way.

271
00:16:50,416 --> 00:16:52,125
-I know.
-Mm-hmm.

272
00:16:52,208 --> 00:16:54,625
I tried everything. Believe me,
I hammered the race thing.

273
00:16:54,708 --> 00:16:56,917
I hammered the gender thing,
the trans thing,

274
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,125
the border thing, the homeless thing,

275
00:16:59,208 --> 00:17:03,125
the war thing, the election thing,
the abortion thing, the climate thing.

276
00:17:03,916 --> 00:17:07,833
Thing about induction stoves,
Israel, library books, vaccines,

277
00:17:07,916 --> 00:17:11,000
pronouns, AK-47s, socialism, BLM,

278
00:17:11,083 --> 00:17:15,000
CRT, the CDC, DEI, 5G, everything.

279
00:17:15,708 --> 00:17:19,708
All of it I did.
Nobody, just nothing.

280
00:17:20,458 --> 00:17:22,583
People are just numb these days.
I don't know why.

281
00:17:22,666 --> 00:17:25,542
Maybe we need to get back
to fundamentals, you know,

282
00:17:25,625 --> 00:17:29,083
basic building blocks
on how to genuinely inspire people.

283
00:17:29,166 --> 00:17:31,208
The basics,
like, show them something they hate

284
00:17:31,291 --> 00:17:33,958
and then make them afraid it's gonna
take away something they love?

285
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:37,042
Well, no.

286
00:17:37,125 --> 00:17:38,458
Vera.

287
00:17:38,541 --> 00:17:41,250
<i>Nat Sharp, the town's local doctor.</i>

288
00:17:41,333 --> 00:17:43,625
<i>His life revolved around his wife, Darla.</i>

289
00:17:44,291 --> 00:17:45,875
<i>She was his everything.</i>

290
00:17:45,958 --> 00:17:47,792
Darla left me last week.

291
00:17:47,875 --> 00:17:49,625
Oh, I'm sorry.

292
00:17:50,125 --> 00:17:53,000
Took the kids, moved to Tucson

293
00:17:54,166 --> 00:17:56,791
with some guy that she met
on a Phish message board.

294
00:18:00,416 --> 00:18:01,542
Phish the band?

295
00:18:01,625 --> 00:18:03,125
I had no idea.

296
00:18:03,958 --> 00:18:06,792
<i>Dr. Nat was spinning out.</i>

297
00:18:06,875 --> 00:18:10,708
<i>He wasn't successful enough,
rich enough, good enough for her.</i>

298
00:18:10,791 --> 00:18:13,000
<i>He would do anything to get her back.</i>

299
00:18:17,125 --> 00:18:19,750
<i>The closest thing we have
to a local celebrity,</i>

300
00:18:19,833 --> 00:18:22,041
<i>the sci-fi writer Lee Ross.</i>

301
00:18:23,125 --> 00:18:25,271
<i>You probably know
at least some of his books.</i>

302
00:18:25,666 --> 00:18:28,000
{\an8}The Crescent Limbo <i>series,</i>
Ice Pick of Time,

303
00:18:28,083 --> 00:18:29,500
{\an8}The Crystaline Juncture.

304
00:18:30,291 --> 00:18:32,708
<i>Ten years ago,
Lee moved here from New York,</i>

305
00:18:32,791 --> 00:18:35,792
<i>connected with Wicks and the church,
and as he puts it...</i>

306
00:18:35,875 --> 00:18:37,375
Unplugged my brain, you know,

307
00:18:37,458 --> 00:18:41,958
from the... liberal hive mind
and... come here and...

308
00:18:42,875 --> 00:18:46,833
<i>His book sales and popular standing
have been in slow decline ever since.</i>

309
00:18:47,958 --> 00:18:51,292
<i>But he'd spent the last year
writing a massive book about Wicks.</i>

310
00:18:51,375 --> 00:18:52,875
His teachings, my reflections,

311
00:18:52,958 --> 00:18:56,375
essays and recollections
of an acolyte at the feet of a prophet.

312
00:18:56,458 --> 00:18:58,625
The Holy Man and the Troubadour.

313
00:18:58,708 --> 00:19:02,333
<i>I found it a tough read,
but he pinned all of his hopes on it.</i>

314
00:19:02,416 --> 00:19:05,792
This is my last chance ticket
out of Substack hell.

315
00:19:05,875 --> 00:19:08,625
I can't take it anymore.
My readers these days...

316
00:19:09,125 --> 00:19:11,458
I mean, they are survivalist freaks.

317
00:19:11,541 --> 00:19:14,167
They all look like John Goodman
in <i>The Big Lebowski.</i>

318
00:19:18,125 --> 00:19:21,291
This little shitwick, Cy.

319
00:19:22,041 --> 00:19:25,167
He's got his little influencer fangs
in the Monsignor lately.

320
00:19:25,250 --> 00:19:27,917
We don't like him. We're all like,
"Wicks. Be careful,

321
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:32,166
you gotta shake him off.
He's bad news. Opportunistic poetaster."

322
00:19:33,166 --> 00:19:36,708
We're gonna have to protect Wicks
from these leeching millennials.

323
00:19:36,791 --> 00:19:39,583
<i>Simone was new to town,
and new to the church.</i>

324
00:19:39,666 --> 00:19:43,291
<i>She'd been a world-class cellist.</i>

325
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:49,500
<i>Forced to retire five years ago
for health reasons.</i>

326
00:19:49,583 --> 00:19:52,417
<i>Chronic pain. Some mysterious nerve thing</i>

327
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:54,750
<i>-that doctors cannot diagnose.</i>
-Sorry.

328
00:19:54,833 --> 00:19:57,000
I believed they could heal me.

329
00:19:57,083 --> 00:19:58,791
Suckered.

330
00:19:59,291 --> 00:20:00,625
Dipshit <i>moi.</i>

331
00:20:02,166 --> 00:20:04,417
I mean, to take someone's faith

332
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:06,208
and exploit it for money

333
00:20:08,083 --> 00:20:09,500
is the ultimate evil.

334
00:20:11,750 --> 00:20:13,083
Don't you think it is?

335
00:20:13,166 --> 00:20:15,375
Yeah. Yeah, it's bad.

336
00:20:16,791 --> 00:20:18,916
But I understand wanting to believe.

337
00:20:20,958 --> 00:20:22,500
This feels different, though.

338
00:20:24,333 --> 00:20:26,833
Faith in God to heal me.

339
00:20:29,041 --> 00:20:30,250
This is different.

340
00:20:33,625 --> 00:20:36,250
I feel hopeful now.

341
00:20:38,125 --> 00:20:40,416
Like a miracle could happen.

342
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:45,916
That's how Monsignor Wicks makes me feel.

343
00:20:56,708 --> 00:20:59,708
The Spirit really moved him today, huh?

344
00:21:00,958 --> 00:21:02,166
Monsignor!

345
00:21:03,083 --> 00:21:04,333
Ah, my warrior.

346
00:21:04,916 --> 00:21:07,917
<i>Wicks kept his core group tight.</i>

347
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:11,583
<i>And the seductive power
of his charisma was undeniable.</i>

348
00:21:13,666 --> 00:21:14,875
<i>But his method...</i>

349
00:21:15,875 --> 00:21:17,833
<i>Every week, he would pick someone out,</i>

350
00:21:17,916 --> 00:21:20,875
<i>a newcomer usually, and he would attack.</i>

351
00:21:20,958 --> 00:21:24,125
The world wants us all to be okay.

352
00:21:25,958 --> 00:21:29,791
Any of your choices.
Make your choices. They're your choices.

353
00:21:30,291 --> 00:21:31,500
Don't feel bad.

354
00:21:32,208 --> 00:21:33,500
Have that affair.

355
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,125
Tell that lie.

356
00:21:35,208 --> 00:21:37,542
Have that child out of wedlock.

357
00:21:37,625 --> 00:21:40,500
Satisfy your selfish heart.

358
00:21:41,125 --> 00:21:42,458
Selfish.

359
00:21:42,541 --> 00:21:43,666
Yes.

360
00:21:44,208 --> 00:21:47,333
Depriving that child of a family.

361
00:21:48,250 --> 00:21:49,583
Of a father.

362
00:21:50,083 --> 00:21:52,208
An assault on our castle.

363
00:21:52,291 --> 00:21:54,292
The institution of manhood.

364
00:21:54,375 --> 00:21:56,833
My own mother made
that selfish choice with me.

365
00:21:56,916 --> 00:21:59,042
And I curse her selfish heart for it.

366
00:21:59,125 --> 00:22:01,542
Every day of my life.

367
00:22:01,625 --> 00:22:05,792
Putting her needs and wants
before the family God intended.

368
00:22:05,875 --> 00:22:07,166
I am enough!

369
00:22:07,750 --> 00:22:10,333
Me!

370
00:22:10,416 --> 00:22:14,416
Selfish, harlot heart, you are not.

371
00:22:15,208 --> 00:22:16,625
Might as well beat that child.

372
00:22:16,708 --> 00:22:19,375
Yes, might as well starve that child.

373
00:22:19,458 --> 00:22:22,292
Defy the family that the Lord intended.

374
00:22:22,375 --> 00:22:26,291
And watch your child
burn beneath that burden.

375
00:22:29,125 --> 00:22:31,333
<i>This is not the true church.</i>

376
00:22:32,291 --> 00:22:35,292
<i>You ask even the most hardcore
of those in the pews,</i>

377
00:22:35,375 --> 00:22:38,042
<i>they'll say, no,
of course this is not what they believe.</i>

378
00:22:38,125 --> 00:22:40,875
<i>It's Wicks being Wicks,
pushing it too far.</i>

379
00:22:40,958 --> 00:22:44,875
<i>And what he's pushing for
every time is a walkout.</i>

380
00:22:46,375 --> 00:22:47,875
<i>Why does he do this?</i>

381
00:22:48,458 --> 00:22:51,458
<i>Because when that person walks out,
everyone watches.</i>

382
00:22:52,041 --> 00:22:54,708
<i>And even if in the light of day
it's indefensible,</i>

383
00:22:54,791 --> 00:22:57,958
<i>deep down in the dark,
it scratches an itch.</i>

384
00:23:02,250 --> 00:23:05,666
<i>And by staying put in that pew,
a side is taken.</i>

385
00:23:06,916 --> 00:23:08,542
<i>Wicks' side.</i>

386
00:23:08,625 --> 00:23:11,625
<i>Testing tolerances,
tapping deep poisoned wells,</i>

387
00:23:11,708 --> 00:23:13,708
<i>hardening, binding with complicity.</i>

388
00:23:13,791 --> 00:23:17,250
<i>...for a two-run homer
and that brings the Cubs...</i>

389
00:23:17,333 --> 00:23:18,916
Mm.

390
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,500
<i>So I try to offer a counterbalance.</i>

391
00:23:22,583 --> 00:23:25,958
Okay, welcome to our first
Father Jud prayer group.

392
00:23:26,041 --> 00:23:28,583
Um, thank you all for being here.

393
00:23:29,250 --> 00:23:31,958
And this is all about breaking down walls

394
00:23:32,041 --> 00:23:34,541
between us and Christ,

395
00:23:35,250 --> 00:23:38,083
us and each other, us and the world.

396
00:23:39,333 --> 00:23:40,958
When I was 17,

397
00:23:41,458 --> 00:23:42,917
I was a boxer

398
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,583
and I... I... killed a man in the ring.

399
00:23:47,458 --> 00:23:49,375
I built up so many walls of...

400
00:23:50,041 --> 00:23:52,833
of anger, addiction, violence.

401
00:23:54,333 --> 00:23:56,541
It was only when I felt safe enough to...

402
00:23:57,125 --> 00:24:00,875
to put my dukes down, open my arms,

403
00:24:00,958 --> 00:24:03,125
um, confess my deepest sin.

404
00:24:03,791 --> 00:24:06,208
That was the day
that Christ saved my life.

405
00:24:06,958 --> 00:24:09,500
It... He didn't... He didn't transform me.

406
00:24:09,583 --> 00:24:12,292
He sustains me every day.

407
00:24:13,875 --> 00:24:15,458
That's daily bread, right?

408
00:24:16,958 --> 00:24:19,083
I think that's what the church should be.

409
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,416
That's what I want
this church to be, for me

410
00:24:23,083 --> 00:24:24,500
and for all of you.

411
00:24:29,166 --> 00:24:30,678
So...

412
00:24:33,625 --> 00:24:36,041
Monsignor Wicks isn't coming?

413
00:24:38,041 --> 00:24:39,666
No, but...

414
00:24:40,458 --> 00:24:41,375
No.

415
00:24:41,458 --> 00:24:44,542
So, I thought we could just talk
and start sharing and...

416
00:24:44,625 --> 00:24:46,250
But he knows that we're doing these?

417
00:24:46,333 --> 00:24:48,500
Sure, of course. Of course, I'll tell him.

418
00:24:48,583 --> 00:24:50,750
I just... I wanted us
to connect and, uh...

419
00:24:50,833 --> 00:24:53,042
You'll tell him?
You'll... You'll tell him?

420
00:24:53,125 --> 00:24:56,625
Contraction of the simple future tense
meaning you haven't yet

421
00:24:57,250 --> 00:24:58,458
told him?

422
00:24:59,416 --> 00:25:00,750
Why wouldn't you tell him?

423
00:25:00,833 --> 00:25:03,077
-This feels kind of weird.
-Okay, guys.

424
00:25:03,458 --> 00:25:06,458
This is a prayer meeting.
It's... it's not a secret or anything.

425
00:25:06,541 --> 00:25:08,708
-Well, it's a secret prayer meeting.
-No.

426
00:25:08,791 --> 00:25:10,500
That's literally what it is.

427
00:25:10,583 --> 00:25:11,750
I just texted the Monsignor.

428
00:25:11,833 --> 00:25:14,250
Great, so...
it isn't a secret anymore.

429
00:25:14,333 --> 00:25:17,542
Now, if we could get back to breaking
down those walls through Christ's love...

430
00:25:18,666 --> 00:25:21,083
-He says, "What the holy heck?"
-Oh.

431
00:25:21,166 --> 00:25:23,375
-Jeez.
-I'm... I'm sorry. Father,

432
00:25:23,458 --> 00:25:27,458
I came because I thought
this was an official church function.

433
00:25:27,541 --> 00:25:29,750
Only he didn't use the word "heck".

434
00:25:29,833 --> 00:25:31,375
Okay, thank you, Martha.

435
00:25:31,458 --> 00:25:32,792
This is a church function, Vera.

436
00:25:32,875 --> 00:25:34,708
It's at a church.
It's with me. It's official.

437
00:25:34,791 --> 00:25:36,083
-Um...
-Or "holy".

438
00:25:36,166 --> 00:25:38,375
-Show... Can I see that?
-I think I should go.

439
00:25:38,458 --> 00:25:39,458
-Okay.
-Bye.

440
00:25:39,541 --> 00:25:41,417
-Thank you. Uh, Cyrus?
-Yeah.

441
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:42,375
Oh, wow.

442
00:25:42,458 --> 00:25:44,875
Yeah, sorry, Father.
I don't want to piss him off.

443
00:25:45,583 --> 00:25:47,000
Nice try, guy.

444
00:25:47,083 --> 00:25:48,042
Thanks, Doc.

445
00:25:48,125 --> 00:25:50,542
I'm probably gonna post this tomorrow.
Can I tag you?

446
00:25:50,625 --> 00:25:51,792
I'd prefer you didn't.

447
00:25:51,875 --> 00:25:52,958
I probably will anyway.

448
00:25:53,041 --> 00:25:54,166
I know.

449
00:25:56,625 --> 00:26:00,292
I'm so sorry your little coup failed
this afternoon, Father.

450
00:26:00,375 --> 00:26:01,958
My coup? Martha, really?

451
00:26:02,041 --> 00:26:05,458
If we want to pray
or need to confess something,

452
00:26:05,541 --> 00:26:07,917
we can do it with Monsignor Wicks.

453
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,833
Can you? 'Cause you all seem
scared to death of the guy.

454
00:26:10,916 --> 00:26:13,917
Could you walk into that church
of your own free will

455
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:17,208
and confess your deepest sin to Wicks,
Martha, without fear?

456
00:26:17,291 --> 00:26:20,667
'Cause... 'cause if not,
this whole place is a whitewashed tomb.

457
00:26:20,750 --> 00:26:23,167
Yes, I could.

458
00:26:23,250 --> 00:26:24,416
Well,

459
00:26:25,625 --> 00:26:27,041
good!

460
00:26:59,583 --> 00:27:03,416
<i>Holy Week, the week
of special services leading up to Easter.</i>

461
00:27:04,375 --> 00:27:07,125
{\an8}<i>It was on Palm Sunday
that I finally broke.</i>

462
00:27:07,208 --> 00:27:10,500
<i>And then, uh...
twice in the shower this week</i>

463
00:27:11,333 --> 00:27:14,791
doing that thing I told you about
where I hold my hand upside down?

464
00:27:16,041 --> 00:27:18,458
Five Our Fathers, five Hail Marys.

465
00:27:19,791 --> 00:27:22,250
Well, we're at nine months now, Jud.

466
00:27:23,791 --> 00:27:28,583
How are you enjoying it here?
Are you breaking down some... walls?

467
00:27:32,250 --> 00:27:36,125
Bless me, Father, for I have sinned.
It's been a week since my last confession.

468
00:27:40,125 --> 00:27:42,833
I betrayed a fellow priest's privacy.

469
00:27:44,041 --> 00:27:47,458
I know that Martha keeps her
medical bills filed in the office, so...

470
00:27:48,416 --> 00:27:49,625
I went through them.

471
00:27:50,666 --> 00:27:53,292
And I learned you had
a radical prostatectomy five years ago,

472
00:27:53,375 --> 00:27:56,708
making you physically incapable
of an erection.

473
00:27:59,166 --> 00:28:01,583
I can handle whatever this is.

474
00:28:02,125 --> 00:28:05,625
For the past nine months,
I've seen the way you tend this flock,

475
00:28:05,708 --> 00:28:07,042
and I don't like it.

476
00:28:07,125 --> 00:28:08,208
You don't like it?

477
00:28:08,291 --> 00:28:10,125
No, Monsignor, I don't.

478
00:28:10,208 --> 00:28:11,417
Nat Sharp.

479
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:14,708
Man needs to forgive
and start living his life.

480
00:28:14,791 --> 00:28:17,708
And Christ's love should be
a launching pad for that, and instead,

481
00:28:17,791 --> 00:28:19,500
he's just, every day,

482
00:28:19,583 --> 00:28:22,792
getting more and more angry
and bitter against his ex-wife,

483
00:28:22,875 --> 00:28:24,143
<i>against women.</i>

484
00:28:24,916 --> 00:28:28,167
It's bad. And Lee, he's a storyteller.

485
00:28:28,250 --> 00:28:31,750
And it's like his superpower
has been turned against him.

486
00:28:31,833 --> 00:28:34,708
The only story he tells is,
"The world is out to get me."

487
00:28:34,791 --> 00:28:38,042
He was brilliant funny,
and smart and respected,

488
00:28:38,125 --> 00:28:43,708
and now he's just spinning out
and angry all the time, paranoid.

489
00:28:43,791 --> 00:28:46,916
Did you know he literally
built a moat around his house?

490
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:48,333
Really?

491
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:52,333
<i>I mean,
it's mostly symbolic, but yeah.</i>

492
00:28:53,125 --> 00:28:55,042
And Simone, I'm sorry, Monsignor,

493
00:28:55,125 --> 00:28:57,333
but I'm afraid
you've taken advantage of her.

494
00:28:57,416 --> 00:28:59,333
I've seen the donation numbers.

495
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,042
I know how much she's giving,
and the past few months,

496
00:29:02,125 --> 00:29:03,833
she's basically supporting this place.

497
00:29:03,916 --> 00:29:07,625
<i>And yes, I believe in the possibility
of miracles through Christ,</i>

498
00:29:07,708 --> 00:29:09,791
<i>but what you're giving her is not that.</i>

499
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,125
It's transactional, through you,

500
00:29:13,208 --> 00:29:15,647
and God help you,
it makes her feel betrayed again.

501
00:29:16,208 --> 00:29:17,792
God help me. Anything else?

502
00:29:17,875 --> 00:29:20,125
Yeah, why not? Cy Draven.

503
00:29:20,208 --> 00:29:23,583
<i>Doesn't this new YouTube stuff
he's doing worry you?</i>

504
00:29:23,666 --> 00:29:26,083
{\an8}<i>Every week now, he takes clips
from what you say in Mass</i>

505
00:29:26,166 --> 00:29:30,667
{\an8}<i>and plugs them into his political rants.
He's co-opting, and honestly,</i>

506
00:29:30,750 --> 00:29:33,333
{\an8}<i>I think misrepresenting the church
in a dangerous way.</i>

507
00:29:34,583 --> 00:29:38,333
When was the last time
a new person lasted more than one Sunday?

508
00:29:38,958 --> 00:29:40,333
Word's gotten out.

509
00:29:40,916 --> 00:29:42,833
Every week now, it's just this...

510
00:29:42,916 --> 00:29:44,917
this hardened cyst of regulars,

511
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:49,375
and it seems like you're intentionally
keeping them angry and afraid.

512
00:29:50,333 --> 00:29:51,958
Is that how Christ led his flock?

513
00:29:52,041 --> 00:29:54,250
Is that what we're supposed to do?

514
00:30:02,708 --> 00:30:06,375
Right now, you're angry. You should be.

515
00:30:06,458 --> 00:30:08,792
It'd be dangerous if you weren't.
I'd see you're helpless,

516
00:30:08,875 --> 00:30:11,000
and I'd do it again and again.

517
00:30:11,791 --> 00:30:14,083
I'm the world. You're the church.

518
00:30:14,166 --> 00:30:17,125
Stay there. Stay there. Stay.

519
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:21,958
Aha. Good. Right. Yes.

520
00:30:22,541 --> 00:30:26,625
Anger. Anger lets us fight back,
take back the ground we've lost.

521
00:30:27,208 --> 00:30:29,375
And we've lost so much ground.

522
00:30:29,958 --> 00:30:31,000
And now you're afraid.

523
00:30:31,083 --> 00:30:34,041
Look at those bare-knuckle instincts
coming back. Good!

524
00:30:34,875 --> 00:30:37,250
You're afraid I'm gonna come at you again.

525
00:30:37,333 --> 00:30:40,750
But you're protecting yourself.

526
00:30:43,125 --> 00:30:46,541
Because the world wants to destroy us.

527
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:51,250
Your version of love
and forgiveness is a sop.

528
00:30:51,333 --> 00:30:54,333
It's going along
to get along with modernity,

529
00:30:54,416 --> 00:30:56,625
not wanting to offend this garbage world.

530
00:30:56,708 --> 00:31:00,041
Meanwhile, they destroy us.

531
00:31:00,708 --> 00:31:05,125
Feminist Marxist whores.
Bit by bit, they do.

532
00:31:07,208 --> 00:31:10,416
But I carry my burden. I hold the line.

533
00:31:12,458 --> 00:31:13,541
And you?

534
00:31:14,750 --> 00:31:17,166
You simpering child from Albany?

535
00:31:19,666 --> 00:31:21,291
Are you gonna get angry

536
00:31:22,375 --> 00:31:23,750
and fight?

537
00:31:32,083 --> 00:31:34,083
You're poisoning this church.

538
00:31:35,250 --> 00:31:37,666
And I'll do whatever it takes to save it.

539
00:31:39,458 --> 00:31:41,291
To cut you out like a cancer.

540
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:46,916
Five Our Fathers, five Hail Marys.

541
00:32:07,583 --> 00:32:09,583
<i>Christ, you didn't give up on me.</i>

542
00:32:10,166 --> 00:32:12,333
<i>I'm not giving up on this church.</i>

543
00:32:14,833 --> 00:32:16,833
<i>But he was one step ahead of me.</i>

544
00:32:17,666 --> 00:32:20,083
Father Jud's prayer meeting?

545
00:32:20,791 --> 00:32:22,208
I have kept this church.

546
00:32:22,291 --> 00:32:24,000
I have fortified it with the truth of God.

547
00:32:24,083 --> 00:32:27,375
And now the betrayal to find my authority

548
00:32:27,458 --> 00:32:30,583
and faith and life itself challenged,

549
00:32:30,666 --> 00:32:32,833
and from inside my own sanctuary.

550
00:32:35,333 --> 00:32:36,416
Get out!

551
00:32:40,083 --> 00:32:41,708
<i>Wicks' final move.</i>

552
00:32:41,791 --> 00:32:43,625
<i>Open war against me.</i>

553
00:32:46,416 --> 00:32:48,166
<i>I got pretty toasty.</i>

554
00:32:48,750 --> 00:32:51,500
The world's a wolf. You devil.

555
00:32:51,583 --> 00:32:53,291
You devil wolf.

556
00:32:53,791 --> 00:32:55,208
You're a devil wolf.

557
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,208
Shit.

558
00:32:57,708 --> 00:33:01,167
-Oh! Nikolai, I'm sorry. I broke that...
-No, no, no. Don't worry about it.

559
00:33:01,250 --> 00:33:03,667
-...with my hand.
-They're junk lamps. They're junk lamps.

560
00:33:03,750 --> 00:33:05,500
-Come on. Hey, are you good to drive?
-Yeah.

561
00:33:05,583 --> 00:33:06,417
Are you sure?

562
00:33:22,625 --> 00:33:23,833
Hey!

563
00:33:26,625 --> 00:33:27,750
Who's there?

564
00:33:27,833 --> 00:33:28,875
Oh, shit.

565
00:33:30,333 --> 00:33:32,458
<i>And that brings us to Good Friday.</i>

566
00:33:34,625 --> 00:33:35,917
<i>Here we go.</i>

567
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,208
<i>It was a 3:00 p.m. service.</i>

568
00:33:39,125 --> 00:33:40,375
<i>Just the regulars.</i>

569
00:33:41,208 --> 00:33:43,110
<i>There was a strange tension in the air.</i>

570
00:33:43,708 --> 00:33:46,049
<i>I can't recall the homily,
but it felt different.</i>

571
00:33:47,500 --> 00:33:49,875
<i>The anger felt less calculated.</i>

572
00:33:50,875 --> 00:33:51,708
<i>More unhinged.</i>

573
00:33:57,708 --> 00:34:01,292
<i>As always, after the homily,
Wicks was spent,</i>

574
00:34:01,375 --> 00:34:04,666
<i>emotionally and physically,
and needed some time to recover.</i>

575
00:34:06,708 --> 00:34:08,958
<i>He would duck into
the small storage closet</i>

576
00:34:09,041 --> 00:34:12,000
<i>just to the side of the sanctuary
so he'd be out of sight.</i>

577
00:34:13,208 --> 00:34:16,208
<i>He'd fortify himself,
and I would continue the service</i>

578
00:34:16,291 --> 00:34:19,458
<i>until he felt strong enough
to rejoin and take over.</i>

579
00:34:19,541 --> 00:34:22,375
<i>♪ Behold the wood of the cross ♪</i>

580
00:34:22,458 --> 00:34:25,542
<i>♪ On which hung
The salvation of the world ♪</i>

581
00:34:34,458 --> 00:34:35,625
Monsignor?

582
00:34:50,166 --> 00:34:51,250
What's wrong?

583
00:34:53,083 --> 00:34:54,125
Jefferson?

584
00:35:16,583 --> 00:35:17,500
Jud.

585
00:35:20,625 --> 00:35:22,088
There's something in his back.

586
00:35:22,416 --> 00:35:23,733
Wait. Don't touch it.

587
00:35:24,500 --> 00:35:25,963
Don't... don't touch anything.

588
00:35:44,458 --> 00:35:46,500
Satan! Satan struck him down!

589
00:35:46,583 --> 00:35:48,083
-The devil... Satan...
-Martha.

590
00:35:48,166 --> 00:35:49,750
-...struck him down!
-Oh, no.

591
00:35:49,833 --> 00:35:52,708
Martha! Please.

592
00:36:29,500 --> 00:36:32,000
<i>The ambulance took
just five minutes to arrive.</i>

593
00:36:34,375 --> 00:36:36,583
<i>Wicks was pronounced dead
on the scene.</i>

594
00:36:37,291 --> 00:36:40,833
<i>When I joined the others outside,
the police were just arriving.</i>

595
00:36:40,916 --> 00:36:43,750
The devil will not take
that man.

596
00:36:43,833 --> 00:36:46,750
He will rise again
in the glory of the Lord.

597
00:36:47,750 --> 00:36:50,500
<i>This was an insane event
for a tiny town,</i>

598
00:36:50,583 --> 00:36:54,583
<i>and poor Geraldine, the local chief,
was thrown in headlong.</i>

599
00:36:54,666 --> 00:36:56,166
Christ.

600
00:36:57,375 --> 00:37:00,583
<i>Hours of questioning
all through the day Saturday</i>

601
00:37:01,250 --> 00:37:03,875
<i>-until finally...</i>
-You're the only one on stage

602
00:37:03,958 --> 00:37:06,291
with the Monsignor
at the time of his killing.

603
00:37:07,041 --> 00:37:09,083
And you had prior possession
of the wolf-head figurine

604
00:37:09,166 --> 00:37:10,666
attached to the murder weapon.

605
00:37:12,500 --> 00:37:14,875
And you're the only one
at that church who hated his guts.

606
00:37:14,958 --> 00:37:16,792
I... I don't hate any guts.

607
00:37:16,875 --> 00:37:22,166
But it's literally impossible for anyone
to have done this, so I don't...

608
00:37:23,750 --> 00:37:26,833
Oh, I don't know what this is.

609
00:37:31,250 --> 00:37:34,167
All right. Father,
why don't you go get some rest?

610
00:37:34,250 --> 00:37:37,665
But I should warn you before
you walk out of here, the town is talking.

611
00:37:37,833 --> 00:37:40,250
Cy Draven put this up
on his YouTube this morning.

612
00:37:40,333 --> 00:37:42,458
<i>...poisoning this church.</i>

613
00:37:42,541 --> 00:37:44,750
<i>And I'll do whatever it takes to save it.</i>

614
00:37:45,291 --> 00:37:49,125
<i>To cut you out like a cancer.</i>

615
00:37:50,958 --> 00:37:53,333
It's been reposted.

616
00:37:54,833 --> 00:37:55,958
Quite a bit.

617
00:38:31,208 --> 00:38:35,625
<i>I turned on my phone
for two minutes, and that was a mistake.</i>

618
00:38:36,166 --> 00:38:39,666
<i>A flood of messages to the killer priest.</i>

619
00:38:41,875 --> 00:38:45,541
<i>But I wasn't thinking about
getting arrested or defrocked.</i>

620
00:38:46,083 --> 00:38:49,916
<i>I was thinking Wicks had won.</i>

621
00:38:51,125 --> 00:38:53,958
<i>Because in the part of my soul
that cannot lie to Christ,</i>

622
00:38:54,041 --> 00:38:56,875
<i>or myself, or you...</i>

623
00:39:00,333 --> 00:39:03,333
<i>...I was happy the old man was dead.</i>

624
00:39:11,791 --> 00:39:12,875
Jesus.

625
00:39:13,708 --> 00:39:16,291
Help me.

626
00:39:17,333 --> 00:39:19,750
Show me the way through this, please.

627
00:39:24,083 --> 00:39:25,666
Hello?

628
00:39:29,416 --> 00:39:31,041
Oh, I'm sorry. Um...

629
00:39:32,500 --> 00:39:33,916
Are you open?

630
00:39:35,041 --> 00:39:36,125
Always.

631
00:39:36,708 --> 00:39:37,916
You all right?

632
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,500
Yeah. Uh-huh. Sorry.

633
00:39:42,875 --> 00:39:47,708
-Uh, there's no Easter Mass. I'm sorry.
-Oh, I'm...

634
00:39:47,791 --> 00:39:51,458
-You're welcome. Come in. Come in.
-Thank you. Thank you.

635
00:39:51,541 --> 00:39:56,041
I don't want to take you away
from your priestly duties now, do I?

636
00:39:58,416 --> 00:40:01,083
Well... Isn't this something?

637
00:40:01,166 --> 00:40:02,000
Right?

638
00:40:02,083 --> 00:40:06,375
It's... hard to be in here
and not feel His presence.

639
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:08,083
Whose?

640
00:40:09,041 --> 00:40:12,000
Oh. God... Oh. Yeah.

641
00:40:12,083 --> 00:40:13,667
-Yeah.
-You're not a Catholic.

642
00:40:13,750 --> 00:40:16,000
No, very much not, no.

643
00:40:16,875 --> 00:40:18,291
Proud heretic.

644
00:40:19,250 --> 00:40:21,375
I kneel at the altar of the rational.

645
00:40:21,458 --> 00:40:24,500
Uh-huh. You weren't raised in the faith?

646
00:40:25,250 --> 00:40:27,875
My mother is... was, uh,

647
00:40:27,958 --> 00:40:30,875
very, very religious, you know.

648
00:40:32,583 --> 00:40:34,416
-Were you close with her?
-No.

649
00:40:35,250 --> 00:40:39,042
When I was a boy, we, um... But it's...

650
00:40:39,125 --> 00:40:41,125
-Complicated. Family.
-It's complicated.

651
00:40:41,208 --> 00:40:42,708
Yeah. That's right.

652
00:40:47,791 --> 00:40:49,500
How does all this make you feel?

653
00:40:52,791 --> 00:40:54,625
How does it make me feel?

654
00:40:59,208 --> 00:40:59,958
Truthfully?

655
00:41:00,041 --> 00:41:01,208
Sure.

656
00:41:03,541 --> 00:41:05,590
Well, the architecture, that interests me.

657
00:41:06,375 --> 00:41:09,500
I feel the grandeur, the... the mystery,

658
00:41:09,583 --> 00:41:13,375
the intended emotional effect.
It's...

659
00:41:15,750 --> 00:41:20,958
And it's like someone has shone
a story at me that I do not believe.

660
00:41:21,833 --> 00:41:25,417
It's built upon the empty promise
of a child's fairy tale

661
00:41:25,500 --> 00:41:30,167
filled with malevolence
and misogyny and homophobia

662
00:41:30,250 --> 00:41:34,417
and its justified
untold acts of violence and cruelty

663
00:41:34,500 --> 00:41:36,500
while all the while, and still,

664
00:41:36,583 --> 00:41:39,417
hiding its own shameful acts.

665
00:41:39,500 --> 00:41:41,625
So like an ornery mule kicking back,

666
00:41:41,708 --> 00:41:44,917
I want to pick it apart
and pop its perfidious bubble of belief

667
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:50,291
and get to a truth
I can swallow without choking.

668
00:41:57,708 --> 00:42:02,833
The rafter details
are very fine, though. It's...

669
00:42:04,500 --> 00:42:07,250
Listen... you want to kick me out,
you go right ahead.

670
00:42:07,333 --> 00:42:08,500
No, no.

671
00:42:09,958 --> 00:42:11,542
You're being honest, it's good.

672
00:42:11,625 --> 00:42:15,083
Telling the truth can be a belly rub.

673
00:42:15,166 --> 00:42:18,917
Now, I suspect you can't always
be honest with your parishioners.

674
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:22,250
You can always be honest
by not saying the unhonest part.

675
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:24,875
Yeah.

676
00:42:26,125 --> 00:42:28,125
You're right. It's storytelling.

677
00:42:29,416 --> 00:42:32,958
And this church, it's... it's not
medieval. We're in New York.

678
00:42:33,708 --> 00:42:35,750
It's neo-Gothic 19th century.

679
00:42:35,833 --> 00:42:38,375
It has more in common
with Disneyland than Notre-Dame...

680
00:42:38,458 --> 00:42:40,750
...and the rites and rituals

681
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:43,625
and costumes, all of it.

682
00:42:44,458 --> 00:42:45,875
It's storytelling.

683
00:42:47,333 --> 00:42:48,416
You're right.

684
00:42:51,291 --> 00:42:52,916
I guess the question is

685
00:42:54,625 --> 00:42:56,750
do these stories convince us of a lie?

686
00:42:58,625 --> 00:43:02,708
Or do they resonate with something
deep inside us that's profoundly true?

687
00:43:05,458 --> 00:43:08,125
That we can't express
any other way...

688
00:43:10,416 --> 00:43:11,833
except storytelling.

689
00:43:15,125 --> 00:43:17,333
Touché. Padre.

690
00:43:25,833 --> 00:43:27,250
-Son.
-I'm sorry.

691
00:43:28,416 --> 00:43:29,625
I just...

692
00:43:30,875 --> 00:43:33,291
I just felt like a priest again,

693
00:43:33,916 --> 00:43:36,041
and now I'm gonna lose that and...

694
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:39,458
and lose my purpose
and I'm frightened, I...

695
00:43:39,541 --> 00:43:42,042
I don't know how I'll live.

696
00:43:42,125 --> 00:43:43,291
Blanc!

697
00:43:44,041 --> 00:43:46,583
Hey! You found him! Is he...

698
00:43:55,208 --> 00:43:56,125
Who are you?

699
00:43:56,208 --> 00:43:57,833
I probably should have led with this.

700
00:43:57,916 --> 00:44:00,000
My name is Benoit Blanc. I'm a detective.

701
00:44:00,083 --> 00:44:03,583
I've taken an interest
in the murder of Jefferson Wicks.

702
00:44:04,958 --> 00:44:06,708
You're a detective,
so you're with the police?

703
00:44:06,791 --> 00:44:09,000
No, no. I work in a private capacity.

704
00:44:09,083 --> 00:44:12,250
Everyone thinks I did it. I didn't do it.

705
00:44:12,833 --> 00:44:14,792
But in my heart maybe I did,

706
00:44:14,875 --> 00:44:17,375
and the way it happened
was some kind of miracle.

707
00:44:17,458 --> 00:44:18,541
And...

708
00:44:19,041 --> 00:44:21,541
I don't know. I'm lost. I don't know.

709
00:44:22,708 --> 00:44:24,708
Would you allow me to help you?

710
00:44:27,041 --> 00:44:28,042
What?

711
00:44:28,125 --> 00:44:30,875
Your lips are cracked with dehydration.

712
00:44:30,958 --> 00:44:32,458
You haven't slept all night.

713
00:44:33,041 --> 00:44:34,333
You spent it out of doors,

714
00:44:34,416 --> 00:44:37,333
by the state of your pant legs,
on your knees in prayer.

715
00:44:38,083 --> 00:44:41,500
What I see is not a guilty man in torment,

716
00:44:42,250 --> 00:44:45,458
but an innocent man tormented by guilt.

717
00:44:47,083 --> 00:44:48,291
Let me help you.

718
00:44:48,833 --> 00:44:49,625
How?

719
00:44:49,708 --> 00:44:51,708
This was dressed as a miracle.

720
00:44:52,208 --> 00:44:55,625
It's just a murder and I solve murders.

721
00:44:57,416 --> 00:44:59,666
Wait... Were you

722
00:45:00,500 --> 00:45:03,583
the Kentucky Derby thing with the murder
and the guy that they caught

723
00:45:03,666 --> 00:45:05,167
-with the photo-finish camera?
-Yeah.

724
00:45:05,250 --> 00:45:06,416
So you're...

725
00:45:07,250 --> 00:45:08,375
You were on <i>The View.</i>

726
00:45:08,458 --> 00:45:10,083
-Yeah.
-What are you doing here?

727
00:45:10,166 --> 00:45:13,917
I need to come up to speed rapidly
on the events of that Good Friday service

728
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:17,041
and the goings-on here
at Our Lady of Perpetual Fortitude.

729
00:45:17,708 --> 00:45:20,500
Geraldine has graciously
allowed me access.

730
00:45:20,583 --> 00:45:24,750
If you can spare the day
and accompany me on my investigation,

731
00:45:25,375 --> 00:45:28,458
view the body, trace the murder weapon,
inspect the crime scene,

732
00:45:28,541 --> 00:45:32,125
you are in a unique position to assist me.

733
00:45:33,791 --> 00:45:35,000
The body?

734
00:45:40,916 --> 00:45:43,745
Yeah, I've changed my mind.
I don't think I should be here.

735
00:45:44,708 --> 00:45:47,250
Blanc, I'm trusting your process,
but I agree with him.

736
00:45:47,333 --> 00:45:51,417
No, no, no. I want you to get a clear
clinical picture of what happened here.

737
00:45:51,500 --> 00:45:55,583
To see Wicks as he is, a corpse.
Just an empty vessel.

738
00:45:55,666 --> 00:45:59,125
Not the mythologized monster in your mind,
but merely flesh and blood.

739
00:45:59,208 --> 00:46:01,625
Dead from a knife wound we can analyze.

740
00:46:01,708 --> 00:46:04,541
Just... flesh and blood.

741
00:46:05,208 --> 00:46:06,417
Flesh and blood, yeah.

742
00:46:06,500 --> 00:46:09,250
Yes, that's our wiggly wiggly.

743
00:46:09,833 --> 00:46:12,077
-Yeah. Look at that.
-Please stop doing that.

744
00:46:13,125 --> 00:46:15,708
-Tammy. Would you mind flipping the meat?
-Mm.

745
00:46:15,791 --> 00:46:17,333
-Pancake him. Yeah.
-Mm-hmm.

746
00:46:21,958 --> 00:46:23,500
One, two, three.

747
00:46:29,500 --> 00:46:32,542
-Hey! Hey.
-No, no, no. I don't belong here.

748
00:46:32,625 --> 00:46:35,000
I can't be in here,
I don't know why you brought me.

749
00:46:35,083 --> 00:46:36,208
-I can't...
-Hey!

750
00:46:37,416 --> 00:46:38,750
If you want absolution,

751
00:46:38,833 --> 00:46:42,292
you want ever to be a priest again,
then you need to go through this with me.

752
00:46:42,375 --> 00:46:46,042
The real killer is out there.
We've got to find him, nail him, I...

753
00:46:46,125 --> 00:46:46,958
I'm sorry.

754
00:46:47,041 --> 00:46:49,958
I mean, catch him and get your life back.

755
00:46:50,041 --> 00:46:51,333
Father.

756
00:46:52,083 --> 00:46:54,333
I need to know
you understand the situation.

757
00:46:54,416 --> 00:46:57,750
We are not all buddies
running around trying to solve a case.

758
00:46:57,833 --> 00:46:59,458
You are still a suspect.

759
00:46:59,541 --> 00:47:03,625
The point is, you do not need to be here
without a lawyer, do you understand that?

760
00:47:05,500 --> 00:47:08,333
I didn't do this.

761
00:47:09,583 --> 00:47:11,250
If I can help find out who did,

762
00:47:11,916 --> 00:47:14,375
then I'm in, yeah, let's do it, yeah.

763
00:47:14,458 --> 00:47:15,750
Okay.

764
00:47:16,625 --> 00:47:17,750
The body.

765
00:47:17,833 --> 00:47:19,417
Next the murder weapon.

766
00:47:19,500 --> 00:47:20,666
Then the crime scene.

767
00:47:21,958 --> 00:47:23,375
Stick with me.

768
00:47:30,041 --> 00:47:32,667
I'll tell you something,
I don't even like the devil.

769
00:47:32,750 --> 00:47:36,833
You know, Il Diavolo, it sounds classy,
Italian, that's fine, you know,

770
00:47:36,916 --> 00:47:39,042
then my wife, she buys a devil sign,

771
00:47:39,125 --> 00:47:41,042
then she buys the devil lamps

772
00:47:41,125 --> 00:47:44,708
and then people start, "Oh, hey, get him
a devil thing for the bar, he loves it."

773
00:47:44,791 --> 00:47:48,417
And then, you know, uh,
devil, devil, devil, bang, I don't know.

774
00:47:48,500 --> 00:47:50,875
-But that... But that's it, right?
-Yeah.

775
00:47:50,958 --> 00:47:52,083
Oh, yeah.

776
00:47:52,166 --> 00:47:55,042
But, uh...

777
00:47:55,125 --> 00:47:58,625
But you know, it wasn't red though,
it's red now, it's paint.

778
00:47:58,708 --> 00:48:01,166
-Yes, yes, freshly painted.
-I hope. Hmm.

779
00:48:01,750 --> 00:48:05,292
They filled it with some kind of plaster
and stuck the blade in that way.

780
00:48:05,375 --> 00:48:07,750
<i>I'll do
whatever it takes to save it.</i>

781
00:48:07,833 --> 00:48:11,042
<i>To cut you out like a cancer.</i>

782
00:48:11,125 --> 00:48:14,375
Hey, hey, hey. Come on, ixnay.
That's not cool. Come on.

783
00:48:14,458 --> 00:48:16,750
The red devil head thing,
that ended up where?

784
00:48:16,833 --> 00:48:21,417
In the church, I threw it at the church
and it broke a window, I don't know why.

785
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:25,208
<i>And then
after the Chrism Mass on Monday,</i>

786
00:48:25,291 --> 00:48:27,625
<i>Martha said she found
a small broken window.</i>

787
00:48:27,708 --> 00:48:28,708
Kids.

788
00:48:28,791 --> 00:48:30,208
But nothing else.

789
00:48:30,291 --> 00:48:33,166
<i>♪ I know what's wrong
I don't confuse it ♪</i>

790
00:48:34,541 --> 00:48:36,667
<i>♪ All I'm really trying to say is ♪</i>

791
00:48:36,750 --> 00:48:39,250

<i>♪ They say to cut my hair

796
00:48:53,583 --> 00:48:54,500
Hmm.

797
00:48:56,083 --> 00:48:56,958
Yeah.

798
00:48:58,625 --> 00:48:59,708
Yeah.

799
00:49:03,375 --> 00:49:05,375
Oh. That is, uh...

800
00:49:07,708 --> 00:49:08,916
Dr. Nat.

801
00:49:10,291 --> 00:49:11,500
Oh, f...

802
00:49:13,791 --> 00:49:15,875
Hey.

803
00:49:17,791 --> 00:49:19,208
Just having some lunch.

804
00:49:25,750 --> 00:49:29,292
Nat, I... I can come over later
if... if you want to talk.

805
00:49:29,375 --> 00:49:31,500
I don't think... Yeah, I... Yeah.

806
00:49:31,583 --> 00:49:33,500
I don't think I'd prefer that.

807
00:49:33,583 --> 00:49:35,083
I'd prefer not that.

808
00:49:35,833 --> 00:49:39,083
Ah, there it is.
Here's what you did it with. Huh?

809
00:49:39,625 --> 00:49:41,708
-Come on, Nat.
-"Cut him out like a cancer."

810
00:49:41,791 --> 00:49:43,583
You son of a bitch.

811
00:49:43,666 --> 00:49:45,375
-You tell him, Nat.
-Yeah.

812
00:49:46,583 --> 00:49:49,708
Son of a bitch! Killer priest!

813
00:50:22,166 --> 00:50:23,000
First off,

814
00:50:23,083 --> 00:50:26,042
I owe Detective Elliott a fruit basket
for giving me your number.

815
00:50:26,125 --> 00:50:27,958
I'm just glad to be of service.

816
00:50:28,041 --> 00:50:29,875
Geraldine, you had the foresight

817
00:50:29,958 --> 00:50:32,542
to see that this goes
way beyond normal police work,

818
00:50:32,625 --> 00:50:36,875
this is something
even I have not experienced.

819
00:50:36,958 --> 00:50:41,125
A textbook example
of a perfectly impossible crime.

820
00:50:41,958 --> 00:50:43,500
The stuff of detective fiction.

821
00:50:43,583 --> 00:50:47,000
This should not exist in our real world.

822
00:50:48,041 --> 00:50:49,458
And yet here it is.

823
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:51,416
The holy grail.

824
00:50:52,500 --> 00:50:53,667
I love the passion.

825
00:50:53,750 --> 00:50:56,250
I just need to feel confident
you know this case is solvable.

826
00:50:56,333 --> 00:50:58,708
I'm incapable
of not solving a crime.

827
00:50:59,458 --> 00:51:01,083
That moment of checkmate

828
00:51:01,958 --> 00:51:05,375
when I take the stage
and unravel my opponent's web...

829
00:51:07,125 --> 00:51:08,416
Oh, you'll see. It's fun!

830
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:11,488
-Great, how do we get there?
-The source,

831
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:14,583
John Dickson Carr's <i>The Hollow Man.</i>

832
00:51:15,375 --> 00:51:17,542
{\an8}A Golden Age detective novel

833
00:51:17,625 --> 00:51:19,750
and a veritable primer
on the locked-door mystery,

834
00:51:19,833 --> 00:51:21,208
the impossible crime.

835
00:51:22,958 --> 00:51:23,958
Hold up.

836
00:51:32,375 --> 00:51:35,875
Father Jud, once again,
earning your keep.

837
00:51:37,541 --> 00:51:40,083
{\an8}<i>Whose Body?
The Murders in the Rue Morgue.</i>

838
00:51:40,166 --> 00:51:42,583
{\an8}<i>Roger Ackroyd.
The Murder at the Vicarage.</i>

839
00:51:42,666 --> 00:51:47,958
My God, this is practically
a syllabus for how to commit this crime.

840
00:51:48,458 --> 00:51:50,375
And the whole flock is in this group?

841
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:55,625
Who chose these books?

842
00:51:56,291 --> 00:51:57,125
Oprah.

843
00:51:58,333 --> 00:51:59,333
Oprah.

844
00:51:59,833 --> 00:52:01,833
Martha pulls a theme list
from Oprah's site.

845
00:52:01,916 --> 00:52:03,833
Well, this confirms my theory.

846
00:52:04,416 --> 00:52:06,250
The killer certainly imitated

847
00:52:06,333 --> 00:52:09,166
the traditional methods
of a locked-door mystery story.

848
00:52:09,708 --> 00:52:11,833
Which makes things simple.

849
00:52:11,916 --> 00:52:13,208
Book club time.

850
00:52:13,750 --> 00:52:15,166
Come on, kids.

851
00:52:21,750 --> 00:52:24,083
In <i>The Hollow Man,</i>
the detective Gideon Fell

852
00:52:24,166 --> 00:52:29,083
gives a rundown of all possible methods of
a locked-door killing.

853
00:52:29,166 --> 00:52:31,292
So let's line them up and knock them down.

854
00:52:31,375 --> 00:52:33,500
Possibility number one,

855
00:52:33,583 --> 00:52:37,083
Wicks was stabbed with the knife

856
00:52:37,708 --> 00:52:40,041
before entering the closet.

857
00:52:40,625 --> 00:52:44,041
Father Jud, would you take your place
right where you were?

858
00:52:47,208 --> 00:52:49,333
Wicks completes his sermon.

859
00:52:51,083 --> 00:52:52,667
Any device behind him

860
00:52:52,750 --> 00:52:57,833
capable of propelling
a heavy unbalanced dagger into his back...

861
00:53:00,791 --> 00:53:04,875
would have been hidden from the camera
and the witnesses in the nave,

862
00:53:05,500 --> 00:53:09,000
but certainly would have been
witnessed by Father Jud.

863
00:53:10,625 --> 00:53:13,583
No, I didn't see
a knife-shooting robot behind him.

864
00:53:13,666 --> 00:53:16,208
No. Possibility one, nixed.

865
00:53:16,291 --> 00:53:18,208
Possibility two...

866
00:53:20,083 --> 00:53:21,500
He was killed

867
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:23,750
while inside the closet

868
00:53:23,833 --> 00:53:27,541
by someone or something that was

869
00:53:28,291 --> 00:53:30,125
outside the closet.

870
00:53:30,833 --> 00:53:34,333
Like, something shot the knife
into the closet from out here?

871
00:53:34,416 --> 00:53:35,833
No, that's nuts.

872
00:53:35,916 --> 00:53:37,917
Nuts and impossible on several fronts.

873
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:41,000
Possibility two, nixed. Progress!

874
00:53:41,083 --> 00:53:43,167
How many more possibilities
are there?

875
00:53:43,250 --> 00:53:45,333
Not many. Three...

876
00:53:46,166 --> 00:53:48,958
He was killed while inside the closet

877
00:53:49,041 --> 00:53:51,750
by a device that was also

878
00:53:53,041 --> 00:53:54,458
inside the closet.

879
00:53:54,541 --> 00:53:56,750
So something was placed beforehand and,

880
00:53:56,833 --> 00:53:58,458
what, triggered with a remote?

881
00:53:58,541 --> 00:54:00,542
Well, these walls are thick,

882
00:54:00,625 --> 00:54:04,125
but a very strong RF signal
could blast through 'em.

883
00:54:04,875 --> 00:54:07,216
So where would one hide...

884
00:54:07,625 --> 00:54:12,041
...a fully functional
remote-controlled knife-propelling device

885
00:54:12,583 --> 00:54:14,333
in an empty box, mm?

886
00:54:15,125 --> 00:54:16,792
Wicks fell on his stomach.

887
00:54:16,875 --> 00:54:19,583
I remember that clangy thud.

888
00:54:21,583 --> 00:54:24,000
<i>And his face was towards the door,</i>

889
00:54:24,083 --> 00:54:26,132
so he was standing at the back facing out,

890
00:54:27,166 --> 00:54:30,583
so the knife must have
somehow come through the back wall.

891
00:54:31,083 --> 00:54:33,500
Clangy thud. Very good.

892
00:54:34,041 --> 00:54:35,250
However,

893
00:54:36,250 --> 00:54:38,125
Rock of Gibraltar.

894
00:54:38,958 --> 00:54:40,041
What about...

895
00:54:40,541 --> 00:54:43,042
What about a false wall
that was removed later?

896
00:54:43,125 --> 00:54:45,083
Go to town, Father Brown.

897
00:54:45,166 --> 00:54:46,625
What? No, no.

898
00:54:46,708 --> 00:54:48,792
My boys would have noticed a fake wall.

899
00:54:52,750 --> 00:54:56,583
Yeah. And removing it later
would have been no small task.

900
00:54:58,416 --> 00:55:01,166
Nothing else was found
on the floor of this space, yes?

901
00:55:01,833 --> 00:55:04,458
Nope. No, just the red thread.

902
00:55:06,500 --> 00:55:07,833
Wait, what? The...

903
00:55:07,916 --> 00:55:09,625
The red thread?

904
00:55:11,583 --> 00:55:15,208
Two strings of thick red thread
about three inches long, found there

905
00:55:15,291 --> 00:55:17,375
over by the body next to the hip.

906
00:55:19,333 --> 00:55:20,916
So, what's possibility four?

907
00:55:26,125 --> 00:55:27,208
Martha?

908
00:55:28,166 --> 00:55:30,292
-Throw them out.
-Martha?

909
00:55:30,375 --> 00:55:31,667
Throw them out!

910
00:55:31,750 --> 00:55:35,000
To walk this holy place

911
00:55:35,083 --> 00:55:38,417
like some crime scene. Like some

912
00:55:38,500 --> 00:55:42,208
tawdry police show talking of robots!

913
00:55:42,791 --> 00:55:46,208
It's not right, Father,
it isn't, it's not right!

914
00:55:48,833 --> 00:55:51,541
Martha, you should go home, get some rest.

915
00:55:52,083 --> 00:55:53,351
Can I do anything for you?

916
00:55:54,041 --> 00:55:55,083
Leave.

917
00:55:55,791 --> 00:55:57,625
No one wants you here anymore.

918
00:55:58,125 --> 00:56:02,917
You've always hated the Monsignor
and you have nothing but contempt for us.

919
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:05,417
-That's not true.
-Murder in your heart...

920
00:56:05,500 --> 00:56:07,125
-No.
-...blood on your hands

921
00:56:07,208 --> 00:56:09,208
just like the harlot whore.

922
00:56:09,291 --> 00:56:12,583
Your original sin has stained this place.

923
00:56:13,333 --> 00:56:15,083
False priest!

924
00:56:17,958 --> 00:56:19,541
Sorry.

925
00:56:20,375 --> 00:56:22,458
But, yeah,
if finding the facts with that detective

926
00:56:22,541 --> 00:56:24,882
puts me against you
and this flock then so be it.

927
00:56:27,583 --> 00:56:28,666
Sorry.

928
00:56:39,458 --> 00:56:41,291
Can I use your bag?

929
00:56:42,791 --> 00:56:44,333
Sure. Go ahead.

930
00:56:47,958 --> 00:56:49,375
Are you okay?

931
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:53,292
<i>A fog was clearing.
This was a puzzle that was solvable.</i>

932
00:56:53,375 --> 00:56:56,000
<i>The body, the weapon,
the crime scene, robot-knife guns,</i>

933
00:56:56,083 --> 00:56:59,125
<i>and angles of view
and stone walls and remote controls.</i>

934
00:57:01,583 --> 00:57:02,875
<i>And remote controls.</i>

935
00:57:02,958 --> 00:57:06,417
<i>But it's a new day...
The Cubs...</i>

936
00:57:06,500 --> 00:57:09,250
<i>who would have been
the hero in that game...</i>

937
00:57:09,333 --> 00:57:11,625
<i>But we saw how that went...</i>

938
00:57:11,708 --> 00:57:14,293
You didn't listen to the game
during Friday's service.

939
00:57:14,875 --> 00:57:16,333
On your radio.

940
00:57:16,416 --> 00:57:20,083
I would not. Martha doesn't approve.

941
00:57:21,875 --> 00:57:23,291
So you taped it.

942
00:57:23,958 --> 00:57:25,041
Yep.

943
00:57:26,708 --> 00:57:30,708
Okay. I've overlaid a time stamp
taking into account the broadcast delay.

944
00:57:30,791 --> 00:57:35,042
Dr. Sharp's call to the hospital
happened at 3:47 p.m.

945
00:57:35,125 --> 00:57:37,542
and 90 seconds before that...

946
00:57:43,625 --> 00:57:46,083
So, several things
could have caused that glitch,

947
00:57:46,166 --> 00:57:47,542
but to answer your question, yes,

948
00:57:47,625 --> 00:57:51,125
it is consistent
with a strong burst of RF interference

949
00:57:51,208 --> 00:57:53,750
that you might get
from a souped-up remote control.

950
00:57:53,833 --> 00:57:55,417
Damn.

951
00:57:55,500 --> 00:57:56,417
This is it, right?

952
00:57:56,500 --> 00:57:58,375
This triggered the knife robot.

953
00:57:58,458 --> 00:58:01,250
This has got to be it.
You can... You can solve it now, right?

954
00:58:01,333 --> 00:58:03,750
Did you, um...
Did you sync this up with Cy's footage?

955
00:58:03,833 --> 00:58:07,583
I did, yeah. The iPhone video
has a time stamp. It's very precise.

956
00:58:07,666 --> 00:58:09,667
-Okay. Can you show us please?
-Yeah.

957
00:58:09,750 --> 00:58:10,792
Show us what?

958
00:58:10,875 --> 00:58:13,750
{\an8}<i>♪ On which hung
The salvation of the world ♪</i>

959
00:58:16,875 --> 00:58:17,958
{\an8}<i>Monsignor?</i>

960
00:58:29,333 --> 00:58:30,708
Oh.

961
00:58:30,791 --> 00:58:32,917
So when the RF burst happened,

962
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:35,916
{\an8}he was already on the ground
with a knife in his back

963
00:58:36,541 --> 00:58:38,875
{\an8}and Father Jud was staring right at him.

964
00:58:39,375 --> 00:58:41,083
How does that work?

965
00:58:41,166 --> 00:58:43,875
Well, for the knife robot, it doesn't.

966
00:58:43,958 --> 00:58:46,542
So... this was nothing?

967
00:58:46,625 --> 00:58:47,542
No, no.

968
00:58:47,625 --> 00:58:50,958
This was very much something.

969
00:58:51,041 --> 00:58:53,875
We have all the pieces
laid out before us now.

970
00:58:53,958 --> 00:58:55,083
-We do?
-Yeah.

971
00:58:55,166 --> 00:58:58,375
Consider the origin
of the devil's head, the red thread,

972
00:58:58,458 --> 00:59:01,958
the clangy clunk,
the timing of the RF remote.

973
00:59:02,958 --> 00:59:04,375
It all lines up.

974
00:59:05,500 --> 00:59:07,708
So give us the answer.

975
00:59:08,916 --> 00:59:10,208
I can't.

976
00:59:11,666 --> 00:59:15,125
You said if you had all the pieces,
you would have an answer.

977
00:59:15,208 --> 00:59:16,458
I know. And yet,

978
00:59:16,541 --> 00:59:18,625
with all the pieces on the table,

979
00:59:18,708 --> 00:59:21,958
this crime still truly appears

980
00:59:22,750 --> 00:59:23,958
impossible.

981
00:59:24,791 --> 00:59:26,417
You told me you could solve this.

982
00:59:28,458 --> 00:59:30,041
That's what you do.

983
00:59:31,083 --> 00:59:33,583
I put my faith in you.

984
00:59:33,666 --> 00:59:37,167
Oh, God. Oh, God.

985
00:59:37,250 --> 00:59:41,292
You haven't slept in 36 hours.
I think it's bedtime.

986
00:59:41,375 --> 00:59:42,541
Yeah.

987
00:59:43,166 --> 00:59:45,792
It's been a hell of a day.
Good night, Father Jud.

988
00:59:45,875 --> 00:59:47,500
Come on. I'll drive you back.

989
00:59:56,833 --> 00:59:59,292
You know, you're right.

990
00:59:59,375 --> 01:00:02,083
This can't be impossible.

991
01:00:03,333 --> 01:00:05,166
There must be a piece missing.

992
01:00:06,458 --> 01:00:08,458
And I think I know where to find it.

993
01:00:09,041 --> 01:00:11,708
See, I think there's something in there,
in your head,

994
01:00:11,791 --> 01:00:14,291
that I need to solve this case.

995
01:00:14,958 --> 01:00:17,791
And if I can't shake it loose, I'm sorry,

996
01:00:18,333 --> 01:00:20,750
but I'm gonna have to
go in there and get it.

997
01:00:23,250 --> 01:00:25,166
Okay, you're freaking me out now.

998
01:00:27,250 --> 01:00:29,417
I don't... I don't understand.

999
01:00:29,500 --> 01:00:32,458
{\an8}I don't get how this will help.
You want me to write the story?

1000
01:00:32,541 --> 01:00:34,750
{\an8}Yes, the story.

1001
01:00:34,833 --> 01:00:37,542
{\an8}The story of the Reverend Wicks' murder.

1002
01:00:37,625 --> 01:00:38,708
{\an8}Monsignor Wicks.

1003
01:00:38,791 --> 01:00:40,625
{\an8}Monsignor Jalapeño. I don't care.

1004
01:00:40,708 --> 01:00:44,125
{\an8}I need to see his murder and the events
leading up to it through your eyes.

1005
01:00:44,208 --> 01:00:45,083
{\an8}Starting where?

1006
01:00:45,166 --> 01:00:46,250
{\an8}Oh, wherever you like.

1007
01:00:46,333 --> 01:00:49,542
Just keep it interesting,
keep it moving and spare no detail.

1008
01:00:49,625 --> 01:00:50,917
Blanc, I'm not a writer.

1009
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:53,083
Take your time. Oh.

1010
01:00:53,625 --> 01:00:56,292
{\an8}I'll be quite comfortable.

1011
01:01:04,041 --> 01:01:07,041
{\an8}<i>So I've spent the past hour
doing exactly that</i>

1012
01:01:07,541 --> 01:01:10,750
{\an8}<i>and now I'll put down this pen
and hand it to you</i>

1013
01:01:11,250 --> 01:01:12,375
{\an8}<i>and I guess, wait</i>

1014
01:01:12,458 --> 01:01:14,375
{\an8}<i>while you read my story</i>

1015
01:01:14,458 --> 01:01:17,500
<i>of the murder
of Monsignor Jefferson Wicks.</i>

1016
01:01:44,083 --> 01:01:45,291
Why'd you do it?

1017
01:01:48,625 --> 01:01:50,125
Better question is,

1018
01:01:50,708 --> 01:01:53,333
why'd I think I could lie to you
and get away with it?

1019
01:01:53,416 --> 01:01:56,125
Oh, no, you didn't lie.
I knew you wouldn't.

1020
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:59,292
You just didn't say
the dishonest part out loud.

1021
01:02:03,125 --> 01:02:07,542
"When I joined the others outside,
the police were just arriving."

1022
01:02:09,916 --> 01:02:11,625
<i>"Joined the others outside."</i>

1023
01:02:12,125 --> 01:02:14,042
<i>So you stayed inside.</i>

1024
01:02:14,125 --> 01:02:16,958
<i>So you were the only person
with unobserved access</i>

1025
01:02:17,041 --> 01:02:21,500
<i>to the utility closet after the murder,
but before the police searched it.</i>

1026
01:02:23,541 --> 01:02:25,041
Why? I mean...

1027
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:29,208
Why protect him?

1028
01:02:29,291 --> 01:02:31,375
I didn't do it to protect Wicks.

1029
01:02:33,041 --> 01:02:35,292
I did it to save the people
who believe in him

1030
01:02:35,375 --> 01:02:36,792
just a little disillusionment.

1031
01:02:36,875 --> 01:02:39,708
Well, surely everyone knew.

1032
01:02:39,791 --> 01:02:43,292
<i>I mean, it would have been
on his breath after every Mass.</i>

1033
01:02:43,375 --> 01:02:46,333
<i>"Fortified himself."
Oh, clever wording there.</i>

1034
01:02:46,416 --> 01:02:48,583
<i>But everyone must have known.</i>

1035
01:02:48,666 --> 01:02:50,875
The spirit really moved him today, huh?

1036
01:02:51,541 --> 01:02:52,958
No, not everyone.

1037
01:02:53,458 --> 01:02:54,541
Sam.

1038
01:02:55,333 --> 01:02:57,458
The one good person in this whole place.

1039
01:02:57,541 --> 01:02:59,625
Getting sober saved his life.

1040
01:03:01,041 --> 01:03:04,875
<i>I knew the press and police were there.
Why let that be part of the story?</i>

1041
01:03:07,291 --> 01:03:09,708
<i>Wicks had been stabbed.</i>

1042
01:03:09,791 --> 01:03:13,542
<i>I don't know how or by who,
but I... but I knew he'd been stabbed.</i>

1043
01:03:13,625 --> 01:03:15,625
<i>So this had nothing to do with it.</i>

1044
01:03:15,708 --> 01:03:17,833
<i>It was an impulse.</i>

1045
01:03:17,916 --> 01:03:20,458
A little storytelling to protect my flock.

1046
01:03:20,541 --> 01:03:22,167
Oh, bullshit!

1047
01:03:22,250 --> 01:03:26,416
And in protecting their bubble of belief,
you have shielded a killer!

1048
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:30,625
Where is that flask?

1049
01:03:31,916 --> 01:03:34,833
Shit!

1050
01:03:37,458 --> 01:03:39,583
Shit. It's not here.

1051
01:03:40,750 --> 01:03:41,916
Blanc.

1052
01:03:42,875 --> 01:03:44,083
I'm sorry.

1053
01:03:44,708 --> 01:03:46,625
He was stabbed, so I didn't think...

1054
01:03:46,708 --> 01:03:48,833
No. You did not think.

1055
01:03:48,916 --> 01:03:51,208
But we're into the woods now,
so you better start.

1056
01:03:53,291 --> 01:03:55,125
Someone broke into my room.

1057
01:03:56,125 --> 01:03:57,416
It's just hitting me.

1058
01:03:57,958 --> 01:04:00,708
This is devious,
it's calculated against me.

1059
01:04:00,791 --> 01:04:03,208
And now you see
the enemy we're up against.

1060
01:04:05,125 --> 01:04:07,917
You have listened to this flock's stories
with empathy and grace,

1061
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:09,750
but we're done with that now.

1062
01:04:09,833 --> 01:04:11,458
We've wasted enough time.

1063
01:04:11,541 --> 01:04:13,958
Tomorrow we use
the gathering at the burial

1064
01:04:14,041 --> 01:04:15,667
to question them all together.

1065
01:04:15,750 --> 01:04:18,666
We must discover what happened that night.

1066
01:04:19,750 --> 01:04:23,833
And what this flock
of wicked wolves is hiding.

1067
01:04:28,958 --> 01:04:29,916
Mm.

1068
01:04:40,916 --> 01:04:42,333
Betrayed.

1069
01:04:43,333 --> 01:04:44,541
Beaten.

1070
01:04:46,666 --> 01:04:47,875
Mocked.

1071
01:04:48,916 --> 01:04:50,042
Pierced.

1072
01:04:52,208 --> 01:04:53,292
Murdered.

1073
01:04:57,375 --> 01:05:00,000
<i>And left in a hole to rot.</i>

1074
01:05:00,916 --> 01:05:02,000
<i>To be forgotten.</i>

1075
01:05:03,208 --> 01:05:06,041
<i>As with our Savior, so with the church.</i>

1076
01:05:06,708 --> 01:05:10,125
<i>Our church is assailed
by wicked modernity,</i>

1077
01:05:10,208 --> 01:05:12,417
<i>by the enemies of God.</i>

1078
01:05:12,500 --> 01:05:14,500
<i>The harlot whores,</i>

1079
01:05:14,583 --> 01:05:17,917
<i>the vermin who would oppress and silence</i>

1080
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:20,417
<i>and bar us from our rightful place</i>

1081
01:05:20,500 --> 01:05:23,208
<i>as the rulers
of a Christian nation of faith.</i>

1082
01:05:23,708 --> 01:05:26,708
And even as I stand before you
as a warrior of Christ,

1083
01:05:26,791 --> 01:05:30,625
in the armor of God ready to fight
the world to my last breath,

1084
01:05:30,708 --> 01:05:33,333
you shall not pass!

1085
01:05:36,041 --> 01:05:39,125
<i>As our Lord was, I am betrayed by Judas.</i>

1086
01:05:39,666 --> 01:05:41,500
Gentlemen, may I have a moment?

1087
01:05:42,250 --> 01:05:44,167
<i>Judas in many forms.</i>

1088
01:05:45,916 --> 01:05:48,833
<i>Always the true threat comes from within.</i>

1089
01:05:50,291 --> 01:05:52,125
<i>Remember my words.</i>

1090
01:05:53,583 --> 01:05:56,875
<i>On this Good Friday,
remember what's to come.</i>

1091
01:05:56,958 --> 01:05:59,041
<i>Remember, all of you.</i>

1092
01:06:00,666 --> 01:06:02,958
You will rise again.

1093
01:06:04,125 --> 01:06:05,541
It will be okay.

1094
01:06:06,041 --> 01:06:07,666
You will rise again.

1095
01:06:08,291 --> 01:06:09,417
You will rise.

1096
01:06:09,500 --> 01:06:12,958
<i>The hour approaches.
The hour I have warned you about.</i>

1097
01:06:14,541 --> 01:06:17,458
<i>Remember what I have promised you all,
come Easter Sunday.</i>

1098
01:06:17,541 --> 01:06:21,375
For I will make good
on that promise, yes, I will.

1099
01:06:23,416 --> 01:06:25,625
<i>For behold,
though He is struck down,</i>

1100
01:06:25,708 --> 01:06:29,125
<i>the righteous Son of God will rise again.</i>

1101
01:06:29,666 --> 01:06:32,000
<i>Eve's Apple restored to the tree</i>

1102
01:06:32,083 --> 01:06:35,833
<i>and the wealth of His kingdom
and His rising reign.</i>

1103
01:06:36,458 --> 01:06:39,208
<i>And as you gnash your teeth
in the darkness,</i>

1104
01:06:39,291 --> 01:06:40,917
<i>you unfaithful devils,</i>

1105
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:45,417
<i>as you lie cold and forgotten and alone,</i>

1106
01:06:45,500 --> 01:06:50,000
He will rise again to reclaim what is His.

1107
01:06:50,666 --> 01:06:52,291
And strike down the wicked

1108
01:06:53,041 --> 01:06:56,000
and raise His true Son
to the throne of this nation!

1109
01:06:56,083 --> 01:06:59,292
Yes, He will rise! Yes, He will rise!

1110
01:06:59,375 --> 01:07:02,000
Yes, tremble in fear,

1111
01:07:02,083 --> 01:07:07,583
for He will rise again in glory
and vengeance and power!

1112
01:07:17,541 --> 01:07:21,004
Sorry about your loss, Father.
Here, sign on the bottom.

1113
01:07:21,666 --> 01:07:22,958
Listen, between you and me,

1114
01:07:23,041 --> 01:07:26,375
I don't care what the Internet says.
I think there's a chance you didn't do it.

1115
01:07:29,666 --> 01:07:31,792
All right, everyone. Listen up.

1116
01:07:31,875 --> 01:07:34,125
Oh, would you look who it is.
It's Judas Jud.

1117
01:07:34,208 --> 01:07:37,083
Father, you are not welcome here.

1118
01:07:37,166 --> 01:07:38,375
All right, stop!

1119
01:07:38,458 --> 01:07:39,667
Here's what's gonna happen.

1120
01:07:39,750 --> 01:07:42,333
Benoit fricken' Blanc and I are
gonna ask you all some questions,

1121
01:07:42,416 --> 01:07:45,583
you'll answer them and we'll get to
the bottom of who killed Monsignor Wicks

1122
01:07:45,666 --> 01:07:48,000
and why and then...

1123
01:07:48,791 --> 01:07:50,125
That's it!

1124
01:07:50,208 --> 01:07:53,125
Okay? Okay, so...

1125
01:07:54,916 --> 01:07:56,958
Thank you, Father Jud, that was

1126
01:07:57,041 --> 01:07:58,208
very good. Um,

1127
01:07:58,291 --> 01:07:59,917
and we're gonna start...

1128
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:04,083
...with what happened that night
right here in this very room.

1129
01:08:04,166 --> 01:08:07,208
You mean the time Jud admitted
to all of us that he killed a man.

1130
01:08:07,291 --> 01:08:10,333
Okay, no, that was...
That was the boxing thing, I was...

1131
01:08:10,416 --> 01:08:13,375
And now he's covering his ass
by attacking us. He's a PINO.

1132
01:08:13,458 --> 01:08:14,417
A... a PINO?

1133
01:08:14,500 --> 01:08:16,083
Priest in name only.

1134
01:08:16,166 --> 01:08:20,292
Helping Benoit Blanc
crack the mystery of the evil, evil church

1135
01:08:20,375 --> 01:08:23,625
and then some libtard
will make a podcast about all of this

1136
01:08:23,708 --> 01:08:27,625
and before you know it, the idiot versions
of all of us will end up on Netflix.

1137
01:08:27,708 --> 01:08:30,417
Oh, the idiot versions. God forbid.

1138
01:08:31,833 --> 01:08:33,208
Jesus!

1139
01:08:33,291 --> 01:08:34,791
It's a miracle!

1140
01:08:36,041 --> 01:08:38,916
-I can walk, Martha. It just hurts.
-Oh.

1141
01:08:39,958 --> 01:08:41,875
-Oh.
-And I say, good.

1142
01:08:42,541 --> 01:08:43,750
Expose it all.

1143
01:08:44,291 --> 01:08:46,041
Wicks was a con man.

1144
01:08:46,791 --> 01:08:50,208
Miracles and supernatural
power of God bullshit.

1145
01:08:50,791 --> 01:08:53,000
I really believed.

1146
01:08:54,875 --> 01:08:56,417
I still wanna believe.

1147
01:08:56,500 --> 01:08:58,291
How sick is that?

1148
01:08:58,791 --> 01:09:02,958
Well, actually, I was inquiring
not about Jud's prayer group,

1149
01:09:03,041 --> 01:09:05,458
but about the shadowy meeting with Wicks

1150
01:09:05,541 --> 01:09:08,625
that took place in this room
on Palm Sunday.

1151
01:09:12,875 --> 01:09:16,416
What was
that meeting actually about?

1152
01:09:18,458 --> 01:09:20,291
Who wants to go first?

1153
01:09:21,625 --> 01:09:22,833
I'll tell you.

1154
01:09:26,041 --> 01:09:29,000
-Cy. Hey. Wait, hold on, buddy. Hey!
-No, no, no.

1155
01:09:29,083 --> 01:09:30,833
You shut your mouth,
you little shit weasel.

1156
01:09:30,916 --> 01:09:32,625
-It isn't your decision!
-Tell him nothing!

1157
01:09:32,708 --> 01:09:34,458
Hey, look... Whoa. Easy, Father Jud.

1158
01:09:34,541 --> 01:09:36,542
I promise you that
what we talked about that night

1159
01:09:36,625 --> 01:09:39,125
has nothing to do
with Wicks' killing, okay?

1160
01:09:39,208 --> 01:09:42,000
But it does have to do with things that,
if made public,

1161
01:09:42,083 --> 01:09:43,542
could ruin people in this room.

1162
01:09:43,625 --> 01:09:46,333
I recorded the whole thing. Just hit play.

1163
01:09:48,875 --> 01:09:50,792
-No! This is not...
-You scoundrel!

1164
01:09:50,875 --> 01:09:54,333
-Open this door, you bastard!
-You are defiling my files!

1165
01:09:54,416 --> 01:09:56,167
-Play it.
-Open it...

1166
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:09,416
All right. Very dramatic, Vera.

1167
01:10:10,416 --> 01:10:12,514
You've got your audience.
What's this about?

1168
01:10:16,208 --> 01:10:18,416
I've been thinking about your mom.

1169
01:10:19,875 --> 01:10:24,708
I never knew her,
but growing up in this church,

1170
01:10:24,791 --> 01:10:28,000
I knew the story of the harlot whore

1171
01:10:28,083 --> 01:10:31,500
and I've been thinking about
what her life must have been like

1172
01:10:31,583 --> 01:10:35,625
to be trapped in a house,
with her father and her son.

1173
01:10:36,458 --> 01:10:39,542
Closing rank, shaming her

1174
01:10:39,625 --> 01:10:42,125
and teaching us all to shame her.

1175
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:45,416
That poor girl.

1176
01:10:51,708 --> 01:10:56,625
Yesterday, I got a call
from a family law colleague in Brooklyn.

1177
01:10:57,375 --> 01:11:00,500
He wanted to
double-check contact details

1178
01:11:00,583 --> 01:11:04,292
for Monsignor Jefferson Wicks, my client,

1179
01:11:04,375 --> 01:11:08,541
because my client
had filed an AOP with him.

1180
01:11:09,500 --> 01:11:10,708
In Brooklyn.

1181
01:11:11,458 --> 01:11:13,666
So I would not know.

1182
01:11:14,708 --> 01:11:16,250
What's an AOP?

1183
01:11:19,625 --> 01:11:22,041
"Acknowledgement of parentage"?

1184
01:11:25,375 --> 01:11:28,083
"Affirmation that I, Jefferson Wicks,

1185
01:11:28,166 --> 01:11:31,625
am the biological father of Cyrus Draven."

1186
01:11:36,666 --> 01:11:39,083
No shame for you.

1187
01:11:40,125 --> 01:11:41,958
Right?

1188
01:11:42,041 --> 01:11:43,666
Who was the mother?

1189
01:11:45,208 --> 01:11:46,833
Does it even matter?

1190
01:11:47,458 --> 01:11:53,291
No. No! No, she came back
and dropped this poor kid in your lap.

1191
01:11:53,916 --> 01:11:56,167
And then she went and had a life.

1192
01:11:56,250 --> 01:11:59,750
And my faithful father came to the rescue.

1193
01:11:59,833 --> 01:12:04,167
Once again, the boys club closed ranks
and there I was, the loyal little idiot.

1194
01:12:04,250 --> 01:12:05,458
Trapped.

1195
01:12:05,541 --> 01:12:10,792
And I obeyed
and I honored and raised <i>your</i> son

1196
01:12:10,875 --> 01:12:13,958
while you sat on your pulpit, shameless.

1197
01:12:14,041 --> 01:12:17,833
You... hypocritical son of a bitch!

1198
01:12:22,916 --> 01:12:24,083
Cy?

1199
01:12:24,708 --> 01:12:25,625
Did you know?

1200
01:12:25,708 --> 01:12:27,791
Not until Vera told me this morning.

1201
01:12:28,458 --> 01:12:29,375
Yes.

1202
01:12:30,291 --> 01:12:31,916
Cy is my son.

1203
01:12:34,625 --> 01:12:36,375
From a loose woman of no importance

1204
01:12:36,458 --> 01:12:39,250
who I knew for one night
and haven't seen in 30 years.

1205
01:12:39,333 --> 01:12:42,416
Vera's father and I kept this secret.
But no longer.

1206
01:12:42,958 --> 01:12:44,625
He is my heir.

1207
01:12:46,041 --> 01:12:47,125
My son.

1208
01:12:49,625 --> 01:12:51,750
Now the world is going to know it.

1209
01:12:53,208 --> 01:12:55,416
So, rats,

1210
01:12:56,500 --> 01:12:57,791
flee the sinking ship.

1211
01:13:01,083 --> 01:13:02,542
Oh, cut the shit.

1212
01:13:02,625 --> 01:13:04,417
You're all standing by your man.

1213
01:13:04,500 --> 01:13:07,792
I just wanted to see it.
I wanted to see for myself.

1214
01:13:07,875 --> 01:13:10,792
You eat his shit with a spoon
and come back for seconds.

1215
01:13:10,875 --> 01:13:12,667
That's kind of condescending, Vera.

1216
01:13:12,750 --> 01:13:14,708
-You don't know what we're feeling.
-Oh.

1217
01:13:14,791 --> 01:13:18,916
I think we're all, as Christians,
very shaken up by what you just said.

1218
01:13:20,916 --> 01:13:23,542
But we're fighting an existential war here

1219
01:13:23,625 --> 01:13:25,667
where the end justifies the means.

1220
01:13:25,750 --> 01:13:27,583
The church doesn't need
some pussy who's gonna

1221
01:13:27,666 --> 01:13:29,708
lie down and take it, we need a warrior.

1222
01:13:29,791 --> 01:13:31,417
We need a warrior

1223
01:13:31,500 --> 01:13:35,666
and I believe that God chose
Monsignor Wicks to be His warrior.

1224
01:13:36,416 --> 01:13:39,250
So, you and your son have my sword.

1225
01:13:39,958 --> 01:13:41,000
And...

1226
01:13:42,083 --> 01:13:43,708
we don't know this woman.

1227
01:13:44,708 --> 01:13:46,333
We do not know her.

1228
01:13:46,916 --> 01:13:49,541
We do not know, right, how she...

1229
01:13:51,541 --> 01:13:54,083
What is truth? Right?
With various sources.

1230
01:13:54,166 --> 01:13:56,625
We don't know that... We don't...
What exists?

1231
01:13:56,708 --> 01:13:58,333
Does any of this exist?

1232
01:13:58,416 --> 01:14:01,042
So...

1233
01:14:01,125 --> 01:14:02,417
Well said, Doc.

1234
01:14:02,500 --> 01:14:03,750
Thank you.

1235
01:14:04,458 --> 01:14:07,385
You promised if I stuck with you,
you could heal me.

1236
01:14:08,291 --> 01:14:09,500
If that's true,

1237
01:14:10,041 --> 01:14:11,666
I don't need you to be a saint.

1238
01:14:12,166 --> 01:14:14,020
We're with you, Monsignor Wicks.

1239
01:14:14,375 --> 01:14:18,833
And literally nothing that you say or do
is gonna change that.

1240
01:14:25,833 --> 01:14:28,666
I will give my final service

1241
01:14:30,083 --> 01:14:32,500
a week from today on Easter Sunday.

1242
01:14:33,791 --> 01:14:35,208
And then

1243
01:14:35,958 --> 01:14:39,792
I will close the doors
of this sad little church for good.

1244
01:14:43,250 --> 01:14:47,500
But not before I have destroyed
each and every one of you.

1245
01:14:50,666 --> 01:14:51,875
Sorry. Wait, what?

1246
01:14:51,958 --> 01:14:53,375
Your drinking, Nat?

1247
01:14:53,458 --> 01:14:54,667
Yeah. What?

1248
01:14:54,750 --> 01:14:56,583
Oh, you're a dangerous man.

1249
01:14:57,333 --> 01:14:58,667
Going to work drunk.

1250
01:14:58,750 --> 01:15:01,916
Treating patients, children, while drunk.

1251
01:15:02,708 --> 01:15:04,458
This community should know.

1252
01:15:04,541 --> 01:15:06,625
The medical board should know.

1253
01:15:06,708 --> 01:15:11,166
No one must ever trust or hire you again.

1254
01:15:11,791 --> 01:15:12,875
And, Lee.

1255
01:15:13,500 --> 01:15:16,417
This, uh, Troubadour book
you've been writing.

1256
01:15:16,500 --> 01:15:21,208
Its boot licking idiocy
is an affront to my ministry.

1257
01:15:21,291 --> 01:15:25,125
It... It's my duty to warn
not only the public but...

1258
01:15:25,208 --> 01:15:27,208
...my friends in the publishing world.

1259
01:15:27,291 --> 01:15:30,250
It must be buried. You must be buried.

1260
01:15:30,833 --> 01:15:34,375
Exposed as the irrelevant clown
that you are.

1261
01:15:34,458 --> 01:15:36,875
What the hell?
What is even happening right now?

1262
01:15:36,958 --> 01:15:38,125
And, Vera.

1263
01:15:38,666 --> 01:15:41,000
You are your father's nightmare.

1264
01:15:41,791 --> 01:15:43,416
He would be so ashamed.

1265
01:15:45,333 --> 01:15:48,416
Simone. I cannot heal a faithless woman.

1266
01:15:49,125 --> 01:15:50,458
I cannot help you.

1267
01:15:50,541 --> 01:15:53,042
You said you could cast it out of me.

1268
01:15:53,125 --> 01:15:55,000
Mm, I promised you nothing.

1269
01:15:56,166 --> 01:15:58,708
I've given you all of my savings.

1270
01:15:58,791 --> 01:16:00,958
You cannot buy God's healing.

1271
01:16:01,750 --> 01:16:03,500
You will never be healed.

1272
01:16:03,583 --> 01:16:06,500
You will die in pain
in the prison of that chair.

1273
01:16:07,125 --> 01:16:10,083
Why are you doing this?
I don't understand.

1274
01:16:10,166 --> 01:16:13,333
-This is a joke. Right? A joke.
-I am so confused.

1275
01:16:13,416 --> 01:16:16,667
Is this payback for the Father Jud prayer
meeting because he ambushed us.

1276
01:16:16,750 --> 01:16:18,416
Father Jud's prayer meeting?

1277
01:16:19,875 --> 01:16:21,708
I have kept this church.

1278
01:16:21,791 --> 01:16:23,917
I have fortified it with the truth of God.

1279
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:27,833
And now the betrayal to find my authority

1280
01:16:27,916 --> 01:16:31,208
and faith and life itself challenged...

1281
01:16:31,291 --> 01:16:33,791
...and from inside my own sanctuary!

1282
01:16:36,333 --> 01:16:37,541
Get out!

1283
01:16:39,500 --> 01:16:41,750
Weak.

1284
01:16:42,583 --> 01:16:43,917
All of you.

1285
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:46,208
You can't follow my path.

1286
01:16:46,291 --> 01:16:48,500
Yes, we are at war

1287
01:16:48,583 --> 01:16:51,125
and I cast you out of my fortress.

1288
01:16:51,708 --> 01:16:52,833
You son of a bitch.

1289
01:16:52,916 --> 01:16:55,792
On Easter Sunday,
when the pews fill with townspeople,

1290
01:16:55,875 --> 01:16:58,292
I will lay bare the sins of this flock.

1291
01:16:58,375 --> 01:17:02,875
Cut you loose and shake the dust
of this place off of my sandals.

1292
01:17:04,083 --> 01:17:05,291
And to hell

1293
01:17:06,625 --> 01:17:07,625
with you all.

1294
01:17:21,416 --> 01:17:25,500
-Well, glory be.
-That cleared the room.

1295
01:17:25,583 --> 01:17:26,750
Cy.

1296
01:17:28,041 --> 01:17:30,042
Why'd he do that?

1297
01:17:30,125 --> 01:17:32,375
Cy. Tell me. What was happening?

1298
01:17:32,458 --> 01:17:34,833
Why'd he torch them all?
Why would he do that?

1299
01:17:34,916 --> 01:17:36,333
Because I told him to.

1300
01:17:37,291 --> 01:17:39,916
When Vera told me the truth,
I went and found him.

1301
01:17:40,791 --> 01:17:44,000
<i>And he embraced me as a son
for the first time in my life.</i>

1302
01:17:44,750 --> 01:17:46,666
He unburdened himself.

1303
01:17:47,375 --> 01:17:49,375
I hate this place.

1304
01:17:50,541 --> 01:17:52,958
I hate this sad flock of losers.

1305
01:17:53,791 --> 01:17:55,416
I want to get out.

1306
01:17:56,208 --> 01:17:57,833
And now, finally...

1307
01:17:58,958 --> 01:18:00,166
I can.

1308
01:18:01,958 --> 01:18:03,166
He told me,

1309
01:18:03,958 --> 01:18:06,708
his grandfather's family fortune,
lost all these years,

1310
01:18:06,791 --> 01:18:09,000
he told me he found it. Just this week.

1311
01:18:09,083 --> 01:18:10,917
No. No, that money is gone.

1312
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:14,708
Nobody knows where Prentice put it,
but it's gone without a trace.

1313
01:18:14,791 --> 01:18:17,417
He told me he found it.

1314
01:18:17,500 --> 01:18:20,625
He was gonna shutter this dump
and retire in filthy wealth.

1315
01:18:21,291 --> 01:18:24,333
And I told him, "Are you nuts?"

1316
01:18:24,416 --> 01:18:27,208
Retire? Do you know the power
of what you do on that stage?

1317
01:18:27,291 --> 01:18:28,542
I've shrunk the flock.

1318
01:18:28,625 --> 01:18:30,375
No. You've radicalized them.

1319
01:18:31,041 --> 01:18:32,083
That is power.

1320
01:18:32,875 --> 01:18:36,792
In a small town, there are only so many
witches to burn and zealots to activate.

1321
01:18:36,875 --> 01:18:39,292
Your flame lacks fuel.

1322
01:18:39,375 --> 01:18:40,875
But on the Internet,

1323
01:18:41,375 --> 01:18:42,583
wildfire.

1324
01:18:43,875 --> 01:18:45,083
This money.

1325
01:18:45,875 --> 01:18:48,625
Your cult of personality.
Are you kidding me?

1326
01:18:48,708 --> 01:18:50,250
Give me four years.

1327
01:18:50,333 --> 01:18:51,833
You could be president.

1328
01:18:52,916 --> 01:18:55,041
Together we can build a real empire.

1329
01:18:56,250 --> 01:18:59,250
As father and son.

1330
01:19:01,666 --> 01:19:03,000
Like in <i>Star Wars?</i>

1331
01:19:03,083 --> 01:19:05,875
-Yeah. Exactly, like the Rebels.
-Oh.

1332
01:19:05,958 --> 01:19:09,375
His ministry and my political instincts
fueled by enough money.

1333
01:19:09,458 --> 01:19:11,848
Can you imagine
what we could do in Christ's name?

1334
01:19:12,500 --> 01:19:14,042
Yeah. Yeah, I think I can.

1335
01:19:14,125 --> 01:19:17,458
First, I told him,
and I'll admit this is a little personal,

1336
01:19:17,541 --> 01:19:20,292
first I told him
we need to burn this flock.

1337
01:19:20,375 --> 01:19:21,750
They're a liability.

1338
01:19:21,833 --> 01:19:23,958
If they associate themselves with us,

1339
01:19:24,041 --> 01:19:26,917
show up on cable news,
even want a place in this thing...

1340
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:29,333
We need to burn them off like leeches.

1341
01:19:30,250 --> 01:19:32,055
<i>That's why he torched them all.</i>

1342
01:19:32,541 --> 01:19:34,375
'Cause of your petty vindictiveness.

1343
01:19:34,958 --> 01:19:37,982
One of them might have killed him for it.
You know that, right?

1344
01:19:38,083 --> 01:19:40,916
Getting back to this vast fortune.

1345
01:19:41,500 --> 01:19:42,708
So it's yours now?

1346
01:19:42,791 --> 01:19:44,625
-Technically, yes.
-Technically?

1347
01:19:45,208 --> 01:19:47,416
-He didn't tell you where it was.
-No.

1348
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:50,208
His accounts are empty. There's nothing.

1349
01:19:51,083 --> 01:19:51,958
So where is it?

1350
01:19:52,708 --> 01:19:55,208
And then, I realized, 50 years ago,

1351
01:19:55,291 --> 01:19:59,125
what was the safest way
for Prentice to hide $80 million?

1352
01:19:59,708 --> 01:20:02,500
-A Swiss bank account.
-Aha!

1353
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:06,416
And so all you need to do
is find that account number.

1354
01:20:07,333 --> 01:20:08,667
No luck there?

1355
01:20:08,750 --> 01:20:11,500
It has to be
written down somewhere.

1356
01:20:11,583 --> 01:20:13,833
Martha files everything and it isn't here.

1357
01:20:13,916 --> 01:20:15,208
I don't know.

1358
01:20:15,791 --> 01:20:18,583
Here. I thought it might be a code
because he kept saying,

1359
01:20:18,666 --> 01:20:20,458
"Eve's Apple
would be restored to the tree."

1360
01:20:20,541 --> 01:20:24,125
{\an8}That was a thing.
As if Eve's Apple is the fortune.

1361
01:20:24,208 --> 01:20:26,667
{\an8}But a Swiss account,
we're looking for 19 numbers,

1362
01:20:26,750 --> 01:20:28,041
so it doesn't work.

1363
01:20:28,583 --> 01:20:30,708
Vera, did he ever tell you anything?

1364
01:20:31,583 --> 01:20:34,708
Even if he did, I would go to my grave
before giving it to you.

1365
01:20:35,500 --> 01:20:36,583
Yeah.

1366
01:20:37,666 --> 01:20:40,833
You'd have done anything to keep
the prodigal son from getting the fortune.

1367
01:20:40,916 --> 01:20:42,208
It burns you up.

1368
01:20:42,916 --> 01:20:44,333
You bitter hag.

1369
01:20:45,375 --> 01:20:46,791
That money

1370
01:20:47,375 --> 01:20:52,791
is one psalm in the Bible
of my bitterness, you fucking child.

1371
01:20:53,458 --> 01:20:57,541
You should come and get your shit,
it'll be out on the street.

1372
01:21:03,125 --> 01:21:06,542
You. You're a detective. I'll pay you.
I don't care, this is very important,

1373
01:21:06,625 --> 01:21:09,458
my inheritance
and future political career depends on it.

1374
01:21:09,541 --> 01:21:11,667
Can you think of anything

1375
01:21:11,750 --> 01:21:15,250
related to Eve's Apple
that might contain that number?

1376
01:21:17,208 --> 01:21:20,291
Oh, um... Mm-mm.

1377
01:21:20,916 --> 01:21:22,667
But if you think of anything,
you'll call me?

1378
01:21:22,750 --> 01:21:24,833
-Oh, yeah. You bet.
-All right.

1379
01:21:32,208 --> 01:21:33,541
We should look everywhere.

1380
01:21:38,458 --> 01:21:41,541
It might be, uh, sewn in the lining.

1381
01:21:42,166 --> 01:21:44,458
Etched in the metal.

1382
01:22:04,875 --> 01:22:06,166
This is hollow.

1383
01:22:06,750 --> 01:22:08,166
Yeah. Do it.

1384
01:22:29,625 --> 01:22:31,167
Remind me to file this.

1385
01:22:31,250 --> 01:22:32,541
File that.

1386
01:22:33,791 --> 01:22:35,667
-It doesn't make sense.
-I know.

1387
01:22:35,750 --> 01:22:37,792
An 80-million-dollar fortune.

1388
01:22:37,875 --> 01:22:39,625
But if Eve's Apple is the fortune

1389
01:22:39,708 --> 01:22:43,025
and it's not a pile of cash
in a Swiss account somewhere, what is it?

1390
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:47,750
What?

1391
01:22:47,833 --> 01:22:50,000
They must have
misprinted the date on this.

1392
01:22:51,083 --> 01:22:54,583
It says the crypt opening thing
was ordered last Wednesday.

1393
01:22:55,250 --> 01:22:56,666
That can't be right.

1394
01:22:58,541 --> 01:23:01,750
Who would preorder burial equipment
for a man who isn't dead?

1395
01:23:03,125 --> 01:23:06,167
Someone who knew with great certainty
when their day and hour would come.

1396
01:23:06,250 --> 01:23:07,541
Give me that.

1397
01:23:08,583 --> 01:23:11,292
Oh, that's computer printed.
That's not a misprint. That's it.

1398
01:23:11,375 --> 01:23:13,833
Whoever called in that order,
that's the key.

1399
01:23:13,916 --> 01:23:15,500
Okay. Yeah. Yeah.

1400
01:23:19,333 --> 01:23:21,375
Steel Wheels Construction. This is Louise.

1401
01:23:21,458 --> 01:23:24,141
Hello, Louise. It's Father Jud
from Perpetual Fortitude.

1402
01:23:25,250 --> 01:23:27,333
-Oh. Hello.
<i>-Hi, Louise.</i>

1403
01:23:27,416 --> 01:23:29,833
We had a piece
of your construction equipment here today.

1404
01:23:29,916 --> 01:23:32,500
-Uh, a forklift to open a, um... a crypt.
<i>-Oh, yeah. I know.</i>

1405
01:23:32,583 --> 01:23:34,958
<i>It's not too often
we get a crypt opening order.</i>

1406
01:23:35,041 --> 01:23:36,375
Great. So I need to know...

1407
01:23:36,458 --> 01:23:38,792
<i>I actually processed that order.
I do all the processing.</i>

1408
01:23:38,875 --> 01:23:40,542
Yeah. What I need to know, Louise, is...

1409
01:23:40,625 --> 01:23:42,625
<i>-I run this place with my brother James.</i>
-Right.

1410
01:23:42,708 --> 01:23:44,833
<i>-He takes orders but I process them.</i>
-Yeah. Right.

1411
01:23:44,916 --> 01:23:46,917
So the reason I'm
calling, Louise, is to...

1412
01:23:47,000 --> 01:23:49,750
<i>I've been to that church of yours,
but I don't think you were there.</i>

1413
01:23:49,833 --> 01:23:52,833
-No, I... I'm new, relatively new here.
<i>-Congratulations.</i>

1414
01:23:52,916 --> 01:23:55,667
-Louise, I... I have to ask...
<i>-No, it was an older guy.</i>

1415
01:23:55,750 --> 01:23:58,125
<i>-Father... Is he...</i>
-Monsignor, Monsignor.

1416
01:23:58,208 --> 01:23:59,958
<i>-Father Monsignor, okay, well...</i>
-Louise...

1417
01:24:00,041 --> 01:24:03,542
<i>He was preaching when I went and
I gotta tell you, that is not a nice man.</i>

1418
01:24:03,625 --> 01:24:06,417
<i>-But I am sorry that he...</i>
-Okay.

1419
01:24:06,500 --> 01:24:08,917
<i>...yikes, died and,
you know, for all y'all's loss...</i>

1420
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:11,417
Yeah, it's a terrible tragedy
for everyone, Louise.

1421
01:24:11,500 --> 01:24:13,917
Can I... I have to, uh, interrupt.

1422
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:16,000
-I have a question.
<i>-Yeah.</i>

1423
01:24:16,083 --> 01:24:19,458
Uh, the order for the forklift.
I need to know who placed the order.

1424
01:24:19,541 --> 01:24:21,958
<i>-James takes the orders and...</i>
-James takes the orders.

1425
01:24:22,041 --> 01:24:24,625
<i>-...he's left for the day.</i>
-Can I have James' number?

1426
01:24:24,708 --> 01:24:27,333
This is very important. We need to
find out who placed that order.

1427
01:24:27,416 --> 01:24:30,792
<i>-No, no. I don't think I can do that...</i>
-No, it's very important.

1428
01:24:30,875 --> 01:24:33,000
<i>-Excuse me, Father.</i>
-It's very...

1429
01:24:33,083 --> 01:24:35,083
<i>What I can do, as I was saying,</i>

1430
01:24:35,166 --> 01:24:38,042
<i>is I can get that information for you
and then I will give you</i>

1431
01:24:38,125 --> 01:24:39,750
<i>-a buzz back.</i>
-That's it. That's great.

1432
01:24:39,833 --> 01:24:42,458
And if you could call James now,
I would appreciate it so much.

1433
01:24:42,541 --> 01:24:44,458
-Thank you, Louise.
-And she'll call you back.

1434
01:24:44,541 --> 01:24:46,625
<i>I will. Hey, Father,
could I ask you something?</i>

1435
01:24:46,708 --> 01:24:49,000
Yeah, it's... Though, I mean...

1436
01:24:49,583 --> 01:24:51,000
Well, if you can make it quick.

1437
01:24:51,083 --> 01:24:54,042
-This is a priority for us right now.
-Maybe she could call you back and...

1438
01:24:54,125 --> 01:24:56,208
<i>Father Jud would you... Could you...</i>

1439
01:24:57,708 --> 01:24:58,708
Louise?

1440
01:24:58,791 --> 01:25:00,583
<i>Oh, God.</i>

1441
01:25:02,250 --> 01:25:03,333
Louise?

1442
01:25:03,958 --> 01:25:05,958
<i>Will you pray for me?</i>

1443
01:25:09,500 --> 01:25:10,416
Uh...

1444
01:25:11,375 --> 01:25:13,000
Yeah, of course.

1445
01:25:14,416 --> 01:25:17,250
-Can I ask what for?
<i>-Uh...</i>

1446
01:25:18,708 --> 01:25:20,333
<i>It's, uh, my mother.</i>

1447
01:25:22,666 --> 01:25:23,875
She's sick?

1448
01:25:24,625 --> 01:25:25,625
<i>Yeah.</i>

1449
01:25:25,708 --> 01:25:28,333
<i>Um, she's in hospice.</i>

1450
01:25:29,708 --> 01:25:31,250
I'm so sorry, Louise.

1451
01:25:31,333 --> 01:25:33,333
<i>Uh, she won't talk to me.</i>

1452
01:25:33,416 --> 01:25:35,500
<i>We fought last time we talked.</i>

1453
01:25:35,583 --> 01:25:41,375
<i>Uh, she has a tumor in her brain
that's affecting her,</i>

1454
01:25:41,458 --> 01:25:45,000
<i>and it's making her say
really terrible things,</i>

1455
01:25:45,083 --> 01:25:47,208
<i>and so I said bad things back</i>

1456
01:25:47,291 --> 01:25:50,000
<i>and now I'm afraid that
that's gonna be the last thing</i>

1457
01:25:50,083 --> 01:25:52,166
<i>that we ever say to each other.</i>

1458
01:25:54,833 --> 01:25:56,916
Father, I, um...

1459
01:25:58,833 --> 01:26:02,250
I'm feeling pretty alone, um, right now.

1460
01:26:05,541 --> 01:26:08,750
I'm so sorry, Louise.

1461
01:26:10,083 --> 01:26:11,291
You're not alone.

1462
01:26:12,750 --> 01:26:14,166
I'm right here.

1463
01:26:14,958 --> 01:26:16,166
I'm here.

1464
01:26:17,041 --> 01:26:18,748
Can you tell me your mother's name?

1465
01:26:47,458 --> 01:26:50,083
I pray that Barbara
may feel her daughter's love.

1466
01:26:51,166 --> 01:26:55,000
That it will comfort her in this time,
and, Lord, I pray for Louise.

1467
01:26:56,416 --> 01:26:58,542
Be with her
and give her wisdom and guidance.

1468
01:26:58,625 --> 01:27:02,125
Hold her in your healing arms
and let her know she is loved.

1469
01:27:02,666 --> 01:27:04,291
She is not alone.

1470
01:27:04,916 --> 01:27:08,333
This we pray
through Christ our Lord. Amen.

1471
01:27:09,166 --> 01:27:10,125
Okay, Louise.

1472
01:27:10,750 --> 01:27:13,333
You have my number.
Any time, day or night,

1473
01:27:13,416 --> 01:27:14,791
I'm here for you.

1474
01:27:15,291 --> 01:27:17,167
This church is here for you.

1475
01:27:17,250 --> 01:27:18,500
Bless you. Okay.

1476
01:27:19,041 --> 01:27:22,041
Storm. I came to close up.

1477
01:27:23,791 --> 01:27:26,474
I'll get the church.
You take care of the rectory.

1478
01:27:30,375 --> 01:27:32,542
Don't follow me, Blanc. I'm done.

1479
01:27:32,625 --> 01:27:34,458
And, uh, why exactly?

1480
01:27:34,541 --> 01:27:37,000
I've had a "road to Damascus" thing.

1481
01:27:37,083 --> 01:27:39,667
Paul had a holy revelation
on the road to Damascus.

1482
01:27:39,750 --> 01:27:42,625
Yes, I know. He was struck blind
and all that hogwash.

1483
01:27:42,708 --> 01:27:44,708
Probably just a case of pink eye.

1484
01:27:44,791 --> 01:27:48,292
But he was not on the verge
of solving a murder when it happened.

1485
01:27:48,375 --> 01:27:50,875
I mean, what do you think
we're doing here?

1486
01:27:51,541 --> 01:27:54,875
Why do you think I became a priest?
No bullshit. Really. Why?

1487
01:27:58,125 --> 01:27:59,416
You felt guilt.

1488
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:01,917
For taking a life. And the church,

1489
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:04,833
it offered you a place to hide
and a clear method

1490
01:28:04,916 --> 01:28:07,000
to give you a sense of absolution.

1491
01:28:07,625 --> 01:28:10,500
The guy I killed in the ring, I hated him.

1492
01:28:11,000 --> 01:28:12,750
I remember, I knew he was in trouble

1493
01:28:12,833 --> 01:28:15,042
and I kept going and going
until I felt him break.

1494
01:28:15,125 --> 01:28:17,750
It wasn't an accident.
I killed him with hate in my heart.

1495
01:28:17,833 --> 01:28:20,167
There's no hiding from that,
there's no solving it.

1496
01:28:20,250 --> 01:28:24,083
God didn't hide me or fix me.
He loves me when I'm guilty.

1497
01:28:24,166 --> 01:28:26,292
That's what I should be doing
for these people.

1498
01:28:26,375 --> 01:28:27,667
Not this whodunnit game.

1499
01:28:27,750 --> 01:28:29,000
No, now wait a minute.

1500
01:28:35,375 --> 01:28:37,583
Excuse me. Excuse me, I...

1501
01:28:38,333 --> 01:28:40,083
Would you look at me
when I'm talking to you?

1502
01:28:40,166 --> 01:28:42,167
We're looking for a murderer.
This is not a game.

1503
01:28:42,250 --> 01:28:43,625
It is a game!

1504
01:28:43,708 --> 01:28:45,333
Solving it, winning it.

1505
01:28:45,416 --> 01:28:47,458
Getting your big checkmate moment.

1506
01:28:47,541 --> 01:28:51,375
And by using me in it, you're setting me
against my real and only purpose in life.

1507
01:28:51,458 --> 01:28:54,083
Which is not to fight the wicked
and bring them to justice,

1508
01:28:54,166 --> 01:28:57,375
but to serve them
and bring them to Christ.

1509
01:28:57,458 --> 01:28:59,292
Otherwise, I'm just as bad as Wicks.

1510
01:28:59,375 --> 01:29:01,458
Making it about me and not Jesus.

1511
01:29:02,500 --> 01:29:04,833
Listen, you don't
have to understand, Blanc.

1512
01:29:04,916 --> 01:29:06,458
But just please,

1513
01:29:06,541 --> 01:29:08,833
please, please, please let me be.

1514
01:29:15,625 --> 01:29:17,375
-Can you say that again?
-No.

1515
01:29:17,458 --> 01:29:20,333
About making it about you, not Jesus.
Like Wicks, you said.

1516
01:29:20,416 --> 01:29:22,625
Father, this is important.

1517
01:29:22,708 --> 01:29:24,208
Help me understand!

1518
01:29:24,291 --> 01:29:27,375
We are here to serve the world,
not beat it.

1519
01:29:28,125 --> 01:29:30,250
-That's what Christ did.
-So?

1520
01:29:30,333 --> 01:29:33,167
So when Wicks was talking about
fighting the world for Christ's sake,

1521
01:29:33,250 --> 01:29:36,708
he wasn't talking about Christ,
he was talking about his own ego.

1522
01:29:36,791 --> 01:29:39,708
And power.
He was never talking about Christ.

1523
01:29:41,833 --> 01:29:44,958
Yes, over and over
he talked about Christ rising in power.

1524
01:29:45,041 --> 01:29:46,958
Getting his revenge on the unfaithful.

1525
01:29:47,041 --> 01:29:48,875
Eve's Apple is the treasure.

1526
01:29:48,958 --> 01:29:51,375
"Eve's Apple restored to the tree."

1527
01:29:51,458 --> 01:29:52,792
Now, what does that mean?

1528
01:29:52,875 --> 01:29:55,375
Blanc. I don't know.

1529
01:29:56,291 --> 01:29:57,916
And I don't care.

1530
01:30:03,875 --> 01:30:06,542
That'll be Geraldine
coming for her update on the case.

1531
01:30:06,625 --> 01:30:09,250
Now, Father, you're right.

1532
01:30:09,333 --> 01:30:11,333
This is my game, not yours.

1533
01:30:11,416 --> 01:30:14,708
Why don't you head back to the rectory?
I'll handle her.

1534
01:30:16,291 --> 01:30:17,500
Thank you.

1535
01:30:18,208 --> 01:30:20,333
Make sure the door's shut when you leave.

1536
01:30:23,750 --> 01:30:25,583
Hope you catch your killer, Blanc.

1537
01:30:26,458 --> 01:30:27,750
Thank you. I... I will.

1538
01:30:45,250 --> 01:30:46,666
Father Jud?

1539
01:30:47,333 --> 01:30:49,000
-Father Jud.
-He's not here.

1540
01:30:49,083 --> 01:30:50,166
Come.

1541
01:30:50,666 --> 01:30:53,792
I want you to search those back rooms
and that closet thing too.

1542
01:30:57,250 --> 01:30:58,083
Oh.

1543
01:30:59,166 --> 01:31:00,500
It's good, right?

1544
01:31:00,583 --> 01:31:01,875
Great, actually.

1545
01:31:01,958 --> 01:31:04,292
Especially the part where
Gideon Fell walks you through

1546
01:31:04,375 --> 01:31:06,292
the possible solutions
of a locked-door crime.

1547
01:31:06,375 --> 01:31:07,333
-Mm.
-Yeah.

1548
01:31:07,416 --> 01:31:09,666
You covered three of them,
then you stopped.

1549
01:31:10,291 --> 01:31:12,500
Now, having read the fourth, I know why.

1550
01:31:13,125 --> 01:31:15,125
See, I rewatched the video
and I realized something.

1551
01:31:16,333 --> 01:31:18,625
<i>From the moment Jud enters the closet,</i>

1552
01:31:19,125 --> 01:31:23,291
<i>until the first of the flock
has a line of sight into that closet</i>

1553
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:25,416
is nine seconds.

1554
01:31:25,916 --> 01:31:28,750
Nine seconds alone and unseen.

1555
01:31:29,666 --> 01:31:33,500
<i>Plenty of time to do the deed
with a concealed knife.</i>

1556
01:31:37,166 --> 01:31:38,917
That's how it was done, right?

1557
01:31:39,000 --> 01:31:40,291
No games.

1558
01:31:40,791 --> 01:31:43,333
No bullshit. That's how it was done.

1559
01:31:45,291 --> 01:31:47,041
Yes.

1560
01:31:48,250 --> 01:31:50,792
And you knew. You knew all along
and you toyed with that poor kid

1561
01:31:50,875 --> 01:31:52,500
-like a cat with a mouse.
-No.

1562
01:31:52,583 --> 01:31:55,083
I don't have the whole picture just yet.

1563
01:31:55,166 --> 01:31:57,417
-If you could give me a little more time...
-No.

1564
01:31:57,500 --> 01:31:59,792
-I'm gonna be able to get...
-No!

1565
01:31:59,875 --> 01:32:02,375
I found my killer and I'm bringing him in.

1566
01:32:03,208 --> 01:32:04,416
Where is he?

1567
01:33:40,583 --> 01:33:41,500
Sam!

1568
01:34:58,208 --> 01:34:59,500
Who's there?

1569
01:35:04,833 --> 01:35:06,041
Wait!

1570
01:35:13,625 --> 01:35:14,625
Blanc?

1571
01:35:14,708 --> 01:35:15,875
Here.

1572
01:35:16,541 --> 01:35:19,375
Oh, shit. Who's that?

1573
01:35:19,458 --> 01:35:21,375
The groundskeeper, Samson.

1574
01:35:22,875 --> 01:35:24,708
What the hell happened?

1575
01:35:39,125 --> 01:35:40,250
Oh...

1576
01:35:41,208 --> 01:35:43,708
Mm.

1577
01:35:44,958 --> 01:35:45,791
Uh...

1578
01:35:49,625 --> 01:35:51,500
Mm. Yeah.

1579
01:35:51,583 --> 01:35:52,666
Okay.

1580
01:35:53,208 --> 01:35:56,542
Okay, Wicks was 100% medically dead dead.

1581
01:35:56,625 --> 01:35:59,125
I mean, we know this, I'm just...

1582
01:35:59,625 --> 01:36:01,041
just saying, right?

1583
01:36:02,333 --> 01:36:03,416
Right.

1584
01:36:05,666 --> 01:36:08,875
Okay,
then I can also say out loud,

1585
01:36:09,458 --> 01:36:11,792
a man can't just rise from the dead.

1586
01:36:11,875 --> 01:36:14,802
I mean, there's obviously some
<i>Scooby-Doo</i> shit going on here.

1587
01:36:15,291 --> 01:36:16,625
"Scooby-Dooby-Doo."

1588
01:36:16,708 --> 01:36:20,542
Praise to God!
Praise and glory to the Almighty!

1589
01:36:20,625 --> 01:36:22,042
Praise Him!

1590
01:36:22,125 --> 01:36:26,042
Praise God!
Praise and glory to the Almighty.

1591
01:36:26,125 --> 01:36:28,917
-He hath raised His Son.
-Hey, Ritz.

1592
01:36:29,000 --> 01:36:30,417
Set a perimeter on the road.

1593
01:36:30,500 --> 01:36:32,917
News is gonna spread fast
and I don't want any lookie-loos.

1594
01:36:33,000 --> 01:36:34,417
-You got it.
-Chief!

1595
01:36:34,500 --> 01:36:35,333
What?

1596
01:36:35,416 --> 01:36:37,542
That motion-detector light there,
it's also a camera.

1597
01:36:37,625 --> 01:36:39,875
But it's not hooked up to anything.

1598
01:36:39,958 --> 01:36:41,083
A camera, huh?

1599
01:36:41,166 --> 01:36:43,667
I don't know. Maybe it's recording
something on a chip inside.

1600
01:36:43,750 --> 01:36:45,958
Why don't you bring it into the media lab?

1601
01:36:46,625 --> 01:36:48,125
Hallelujah, praise God.

1602
01:36:48,208 --> 01:36:50,625
He has raised up
His servant from the dead.

1603
01:36:50,708 --> 01:36:53,333
Hey, do me a favor? Tape off
this entire area, down to the grove.

1604
01:36:53,416 --> 01:36:54,833
-Got it.
-It's a homicide scene.

1605
01:36:54,916 --> 01:36:56,708
The groundskeeper is dead.

1606
01:37:08,958 --> 01:37:10,750
No! Please!

1607
01:37:11,791 --> 01:37:14,125
-Oh, shit.
-No! No, no, no!

1608
01:37:14,208 --> 01:37:15,625
Can I get some help?

1609
01:37:15,708 --> 01:37:17,708
-Get help! Martha.
-No! Oh, no, no!

1610
01:37:17,791 --> 01:37:20,000
-Martha, you need to back up.
-Oh, no!

1611
01:37:20,083 --> 01:37:22,458
Martha...

1612
01:37:22,541 --> 01:37:25,583
Flee into the dark, you murderer!

1613
01:37:27,625 --> 01:37:29,333
But he has returned!

1614
01:37:29,833 --> 01:37:33,541
And he brings vengeance! He brings death!

1615
01:37:50,750 --> 01:37:52,083
This is Father Jud.

1616
01:37:52,166 --> 01:37:54,666
<i>Oh, Father Jud, it's Louise.
How you doing?</i>

1617
01:37:56,000 --> 01:37:57,291
Uh...

1618
01:37:58,666 --> 01:38:00,291
Yeah... Hi, Louise.

1619
01:38:00,791 --> 01:38:03,125
<i>I... I hope it's not too late,
but you said it was urgent,</i>

1620
01:38:03,208 --> 01:38:04,833
<i>so I just wanted to tell you...</i>

1621
01:38:04,916 --> 01:38:07,542
<i>I spoke to James
and the order for the forklift</i>

1622
01:38:07,625 --> 01:38:10,333
<i>was actually placed by Monsignor Wicks.</i>

1623
01:38:11,208 --> 01:38:15,291
<i>He spoke to James directly about it,
so I do hope that this clears things up.</i>

1624
01:38:15,916 --> 01:38:19,250
<i>Hey, God bless you, Father,
and you have yourself a good night, okay?</i>

1625
01:38:19,333 --> 01:38:22,000
Uh... Yeah.

1626
01:38:22,666 --> 01:38:25,416
Yeah, you too, Louise.

1627
01:38:50,833 --> 01:38:52,125
Jeez.

1628
01:38:53,916 --> 01:38:55,000
Yes?

1629
01:38:56,125 --> 01:38:57,958
Slow down, Martha. What?

1630
01:39:00,750 --> 01:39:02,583
What?

1631
01:39:02,666 --> 01:39:04,500
-<i>It's a miracle.</i>
-Bullshit.

1632
01:39:04,583 --> 01:39:07,000
<i>No, it happened.
Martha said the tomb is empty.</i>

1633
01:39:07,083 --> 01:39:09,375
<i>I'm calling everyone. I'm on my way now.</i>

1634
01:39:15,291 --> 01:39:16,500
Did you, uh...

1635
01:39:17,041 --> 01:39:18,958
What are you doing? You don't smoke.

1636
01:39:19,041 --> 01:39:20,333
I did.

1637
01:39:21,166 --> 01:39:22,917
I smoked for 15 years.

1638
01:39:23,000 --> 01:39:25,000
Did Lee call you? Did he tell you?

1639
01:39:25,500 --> 01:39:26,708
Yep.

1640
01:39:27,958 --> 01:39:30,167
Okay. Well, I'm gonna go
witness a miracle.

1641
01:39:30,250 --> 01:39:33,416
You enjoy your cigarette indoors.

1642
01:40:05,083 --> 01:40:06,291
Praise be.

1643
01:40:07,416 --> 01:40:08,750
It's accomplished.

1644
01:40:10,750 --> 01:40:13,875
Come on.

1645
01:40:15,791 --> 01:40:17,645
Come on, it's...

1646
01:40:18,333 --> 01:40:19,541
He's got it.

1647
01:40:23,041 --> 01:40:26,042
All right, so... it's not great quality...

1648
01:40:26,125 --> 01:40:27,625
-It's fine.
-...but, uh...

1649
01:40:38,458 --> 01:40:39,875
What am I looking at here?

1650
01:40:46,833 --> 01:40:47,750
Okay.

1651
01:40:47,833 --> 01:40:51,292
Um, yeah, so, it records
anytime there's motion

1652
01:40:51,375 --> 01:40:54,875
{\an8}and this clip is four seconds later.

1653
01:41:07,041 --> 01:41:08,917
Okay?

1654
01:41:09,000 --> 01:41:11,000
Prints from the gardening tool.

1655
01:41:12,291 --> 01:41:15,958
We didn't run the full database check,
just the suspects you questioned.

1656
01:41:16,666 --> 01:41:17,875
It's Father Jud.

1657
01:41:22,750 --> 01:41:23,958
Where is he?

1658
01:41:24,583 --> 01:41:26,416
I sincerely wish I knew.

1659
01:41:46,041 --> 01:41:47,875
Blanc. Blanc!

1660
01:41:48,500 --> 01:41:51,042
I'm gonna do it. I'm gonna... turn myself...

1661
01:41:51,125 --> 01:41:53,515
-<i>...388.</i>
-388, en route.

1662
01:41:53,791 --> 01:41:54,791
<i>433.</i>

1663
01:41:55,625 --> 01:41:57,542
-I'm turning myself in.
-No you are not.

1664
01:41:57,625 --> 01:42:01,917
<i>♪ Skimbleshanks, the railway cat! ♪</i>

1665
01:42:03,083 --> 01:42:05,833
I did it. I killed Samson.
I'm guilty. I have to confess.

1666
01:42:05,916 --> 01:42:07,000
-Let me out.
-Listen.

1667
01:42:07,083 --> 01:42:09,500
You're gonna tell me
exactly what happened, but right now,

1668
01:42:09,583 --> 01:42:11,208
how do I get to Dr. Nat's house?

1669
01:42:11,291 --> 01:42:12,875
-Dr. Nat?
-Yes, quickly.

1670
01:42:13,375 --> 01:42:14,500
I regret my stalling.

1671
01:42:14,583 --> 01:42:16,917
I only hope we're not too late.
Now, just get down!

1672
01:42:21,333 --> 01:42:23,458
Hail Mary, full of grace
the Lord is with you.

1673
01:42:23,541 --> 01:42:24,958
Blessed art thou amongst women...

1674
01:42:25,041 --> 01:42:27,208
...sir, that I respect you.
I respect the badge.

1675
01:42:27,291 --> 01:42:30,500
But this is our church and I'm not telling
you that I'm gonna resort to violence,

1676
01:42:30,583 --> 01:42:34,333
but we're gonna stay here all night
if we have to. We are seeing that crypt!

1677
01:42:34,416 --> 01:42:36,417
-Is it real?
-They won't let us in.

1678
01:42:36,500 --> 01:42:39,166
I need to see.

1679
01:42:39,875 --> 01:42:41,708
Please, I need to see.

1680
01:42:59,541 --> 01:43:00,750
Dr. Nat?

1681
01:43:35,625 --> 01:43:37,833
Oh, God.

1682
01:43:38,583 --> 01:43:39,917
What's that smell?

1683
01:43:45,375 --> 01:43:47,000
Just wait here.

1684
01:43:49,041 --> 01:43:50,125
Blanc.

1685
01:43:50,666 --> 01:43:51,750
Yep.

1686
01:43:56,625 --> 01:43:58,125
Oh, God.

1687
01:44:11,333 --> 01:44:12,416
Right.

1688
01:44:14,083 --> 01:44:18,750
Oh, Lord, that is...

1689
01:44:30,166 --> 01:44:31,167
Wicks.

1690
01:44:31,250 --> 01:44:33,500
Yeah, that's... It's him.

1691
01:44:34,375 --> 01:44:35,791
-Is he...
-Yeah.

1692
01:44:36,500 --> 01:44:39,958
I mean, for what it's worth
these days.

1693
01:44:42,583 --> 01:44:44,708
Let's see now. Let's...

1694
01:44:48,000 --> 01:44:49,250
Okay.

1695
01:44:50,750 --> 01:44:53,000
This might get unpleasant.

1696
01:44:53,083 --> 01:44:54,791
I mean, more unpleasant.

1697
01:45:30,333 --> 01:45:31,416
Dr. Nat.

1698
01:45:32,666 --> 01:45:35,500
In the flesh. Yeah...
Or, what's left of it.

1699
01:46:08,416 --> 01:46:10,500
Geraldine, it's... it's Blanc. Um...

1700
01:46:11,625 --> 01:46:13,708
Yeah, he's standing right here.

1701
01:46:13,791 --> 01:46:15,292
Listen to me.

1702
01:46:15,375 --> 01:46:17,542
You're gonna wanna come
to Dr. Nat's house.

1703
01:46:17,625 --> 01:46:21,125
There's a body. Or two.

1704
01:46:22,250 --> 01:46:23,666
It's all here.

1705
01:46:24,166 --> 01:46:27,041
Yes, yeah. It's... it's finished, yeah.

1706
01:46:28,166 --> 01:46:29,666
I'll call you back.

1707
01:46:30,958 --> 01:46:32,708
Father Jud. Wait, wait.

1708
01:46:32,791 --> 01:46:35,000
I killed Samson. I have to do this.

1709
01:46:35,625 --> 01:46:38,601
I have to do it of my own free will
or it won't mean anything.

1710
01:46:53,791 --> 01:46:57,833
<i>Plate check.
Copy that. Any available units to respond...</i>

1711
01:46:57,916 --> 01:47:00,125
Would you call Geraldine for me, please?

1712
01:47:00,625 --> 01:47:03,796
Say Father Jud's returned to his church
and he's ready to confess.

1713
01:47:20,041 --> 01:47:22,667
Father Jud.
I'm here to arrest you for the murder

1714
01:47:22,750 --> 01:47:25,000
of Monsignor Jefferson Wicks
and Samson Holt.

1715
01:47:25,083 --> 01:47:29,250
And you're a person of interest
in the death of Dr. Nathaniel Sharp.

1716
01:47:29,333 --> 01:47:30,833
Nat is dead?

1717
01:47:32,041 --> 01:47:33,333
Murdered in his home.

1718
01:47:34,333 --> 01:47:36,833
We also recovered Wicks' body. It's over.

1719
01:47:37,333 --> 01:47:40,375
Anything you say
can be used against you in a court of law.

1720
01:47:40,458 --> 01:47:43,083
But if you'd like to confess to anything,

1721
01:47:43,166 --> 01:47:46,083
this seems like
a pretty great place to do it.

1722
01:47:48,250 --> 01:47:49,333
Yeah.

1723
01:47:52,375 --> 01:47:54,042
Years ago,

1724
01:47:54,125 --> 01:47:56,625
I murdered a man in a boxing ring.

1725
01:47:58,333 --> 01:48:00,375
I killed him with hate in my heart.

1726
01:48:02,500 --> 01:48:05,916
Last night, that same sin rose in me
and in a moment of

1727
01:48:06,875 --> 01:48:08,958
fear and rage, I...

1728
01:48:13,500 --> 01:48:17,458
I'm sorry, that was dramatic,
but I needed you to stop talking.

1729
01:48:17,541 --> 01:48:19,792
-No. Father Jud...
-I was about to explain to everyone...

1730
01:48:19,875 --> 01:48:21,625
-Sit down and listen.
-Stop talking.

1731
01:48:21,708 --> 01:48:24,667
Please, let him. You were continuing...
Continue, you said last night...

1732
01:48:24,750 --> 01:48:27,083
-In a moment of fear and rage...
-I was about to do it...

1733
01:48:27,166 --> 01:48:30,250
You shall not silence
the voice of the Lord!

1734
01:48:30,333 --> 01:48:35,250
But sit now and behold the wickedness
and shame of the guilty

1735
01:48:35,333 --> 01:48:38,250
laid bare before you all!

1736
01:48:51,000 --> 01:48:54,125
What are you doing?

1737
01:48:57,125 --> 01:49:00,333
Let us begin with Wicks' murder.

1738
01:49:00,416 --> 01:49:03,333
Right here on Good Friday.

1739
01:49:04,041 --> 01:49:05,875
The impossible crime.

1740
01:49:07,250 --> 01:49:09,792
And, Geraldine,
you were correct in your deduction.

1741
01:49:09,875 --> 01:49:14,042
When Monsignor Wicks collapsed
in that closet space, he wasn't dead.

1742
01:49:14,125 --> 01:49:16,333
He wasn't even stabbed, not yet.

1743
01:49:17,333 --> 01:49:20,667
The flask he kept stashed
in the breaker box

1744
01:49:20,750 --> 01:49:24,458
<i>was spiked
with a very powerful tranquilizer.</i>

1745
01:49:24,541 --> 01:49:26,333
<i>He drank from it.</i>

1746
01:49:26,416 --> 01:49:28,292
Fortified himself.

1747
01:49:28,375 --> 01:49:31,583
<i>And within minutes,
fell to the floor, unconscious.</i>

1748
01:49:31,666 --> 01:49:34,625
<i>The clanky clunk.</i>

1749
01:49:34,708 --> 01:49:36,542
Leaving him defenseless

1750
01:49:36,625 --> 01:49:40,125
and giving the killer
their chance to enter the closet

1751
01:49:40,708 --> 01:49:42,375
and deliver the deadly blow.

1752
01:49:43,000 --> 01:49:44,220
I... I said that already.

1753
01:49:44,791 --> 01:49:45,542
Father Jud.

1754
01:49:45,625 --> 01:49:48,458
No. The knife was in his back
when I found him.

1755
01:49:48,541 --> 01:49:50,125
There's something in his back.

1756
01:49:50,208 --> 01:49:53,250
So how? When? It's impossible. I saw.

1757
01:49:53,333 --> 01:49:54,875
What did you see?

1758
01:49:56,083 --> 01:49:57,417
The red devil head.

1759
01:49:57,500 --> 01:50:00,708
<i>Blood you assumed was Wicks'.</i>

1760
01:50:00,791 --> 01:50:03,181
Now, I showed you
the answer to this, did you see?

1761
01:50:04,375 --> 01:50:05,583
Il Diavolo.

1762
01:50:05,666 --> 01:50:07,333
The pizza bar. The photograph.

1763
01:50:08,666 --> 01:50:10,666
<i>You thought you saw,</i>

1764
01:50:11,208 --> 01:50:13,042
<i>but that wasn't it, no.</i>

1765
01:50:13,125 --> 01:50:15,333
<i>It was a second identical lamp.</i>

1766
01:50:15,416 --> 01:50:18,375
<i>A second identical devil head.</i>

1767
01:50:19,708 --> 01:50:20,791
Yeah.

1768
01:50:23,791 --> 01:50:25,416
<i>And it was also missing.</i>

1769
01:50:26,041 --> 01:50:27,375
Two devils.

1770
01:50:27,458 --> 01:50:28,792
Yes.

1771
01:50:28,875 --> 01:50:30,166
Why two?

1772
01:50:31,041 --> 01:50:32,583
And why painted red?

1773
01:50:32,666 --> 01:50:34,083
It wasn't red though. It's red now.

1774
01:50:34,166 --> 01:50:36,917
The same red
as the Good Friday vestments.

1775
01:50:37,000 --> 01:50:38,833
The same exact red

1776
01:50:38,916 --> 01:50:42,083
as the mysterious thread
found in the closet.

1777
01:50:42,791 --> 01:50:46,500
<i>Because the second devil head
was there all the time.</i>

1778
01:50:46,583 --> 01:50:48,917
<i>Sewn to the back of his vestments.</i>

1779
01:50:49,000 --> 01:50:50,292
Hollow, light,

1780
01:50:50,375 --> 01:50:52,541
and filled with a small squib of blood

1781
01:50:53,125 --> 01:50:56,041
<i>triggered by an RF remote.</i>

1782
01:50:57,000 --> 01:51:00,125
<i>Set off
at the exact right moment.</i>

1783
01:51:00,208 --> 01:51:01,125
Monsignor?

1784
01:51:02,500 --> 01:51:03,375
The doctor.

1785
01:51:05,125 --> 01:51:06,333
<i>A voice of authority</i>

1786
01:51:06,416 --> 01:51:09,958
<i>who can wait for the discovery he needs
before taking charge.</i>

1787
01:51:10,041 --> 01:51:11,250
There's something in his back.

1788
01:51:11,333 --> 01:51:13,041
Wait. Don't touch it.

1789
01:51:15,333 --> 01:51:17,667
A moment of distraction presents itself.

1790
01:51:20,333 --> 01:51:22,333
<i>And the deed is quickly done.</i>

1791
01:51:23,833 --> 01:51:25,000
<i>His final task,</i>

1792
01:51:25,083 --> 01:51:29,417
<i>to remove the incriminating
drug-laced flask.</i>

1793
01:51:29,500 --> 01:51:32,416
<i>But where was it? It was gone.</i>

1794
01:51:33,541 --> 01:51:35,667
The one hiccup in his plan.

1795
01:51:35,750 --> 01:51:39,708
The result of a moment
of foolish grace by Father Jud

1796
01:51:40,291 --> 01:51:44,750
<i>who concealed the flask
to hide Wicks' drinking</i>

1797
01:51:44,833 --> 01:51:47,750
<i>and returned later to retrieve it.</i>

1798
01:51:50,083 --> 01:51:51,291
My God.

1799
01:51:51,791 --> 01:51:52,875
Nat.

1800
01:51:52,958 --> 01:51:54,250
Why?

1801
01:51:54,750 --> 01:51:56,917
Wicks was going to scorch
the earth.

1802
01:51:57,000 --> 01:51:58,625
He was going to ruin him.

1803
01:51:58,708 --> 01:52:01,542
No. The bigger why.
The why that brought you here.

1804
01:52:01,625 --> 01:52:04,042
Why do all this insane, elaborate stuff?

1805
01:52:04,125 --> 01:52:07,000
The theatricality? The impossible crime.

1806
01:52:07,083 --> 01:52:08,375
Why?

1807
01:52:09,041 --> 01:52:10,167
Indeed.

1808
01:52:10,250 --> 01:52:12,833
Okay, so... if Dr. Nat killed Wicks,

1809
01:52:13,375 --> 01:52:14,292
who killed Nat?

1810
01:52:14,375 --> 01:52:16,291
Well, now we get to it.

1811
01:52:17,000 --> 01:52:19,667
Not some fiddly locked-door mystery

1812
01:52:19,750 --> 01:52:23,125
with devices and clues,

1813
01:52:23,208 --> 01:52:26,625
but a much, much larger scheme.

1814
01:52:26,708 --> 01:52:31,792
One whose roots
run to the bedrock of this church.

1815
01:52:31,875 --> 01:52:33,625
And one which draws me,

1816
01:52:33,708 --> 01:52:36,958
an unbeliever in every sense of the word,

1817
01:52:37,041 --> 01:52:40,041
into the realm of belief.

1818
01:52:41,666 --> 01:52:43,500
To understand this case,

1819
01:52:44,541 --> 01:52:48,542
I had to look at the myth
that was being constructed.

1820
01:52:48,625 --> 01:52:51,458
Not to solve whether it was real or not,

1821
01:52:51,541 --> 01:52:53,958
but to feel in my soul

1822
01:52:54,041 --> 01:52:57,250
the essence of that
which it strove to convey.

1823
01:53:00,541 --> 01:53:01,958
A holy priest.

1824
01:53:02,708 --> 01:53:08,042
Struck down by no man,
but by the hand of Satan himself.

1825
01:53:08,125 --> 01:53:11,625
Laid to rest
in the sealed tomb of his father,

1826
01:53:12,208 --> 01:53:13,625
but then risen

1827
01:53:14,333 --> 01:53:15,875
by the will of God.

1828
01:53:15,958 --> 01:53:17,958
Risen as something new.

1829
01:53:18,041 --> 01:53:20,042
No longer a fallible man,

1830
01:53:20,125 --> 01:53:24,041
but now a symbol
of the Lord's power over death.

1831
01:53:26,000 --> 01:53:27,625
His justice for the holy.

1832
01:53:28,125 --> 01:53:30,375
His vengeance for the wicked.

1833
01:53:33,166 --> 01:53:36,917
Okay. And now, what really happened?

1834
01:53:37,000 --> 01:53:39,000
Yes. Yes.

1835
01:53:39,083 --> 01:53:42,917
It is time to break this tawdry facade

1836
01:53:43,000 --> 01:53:47,000
of miracles and resurrections
and reveal what really happened.

1837
01:53:47,083 --> 01:53:49,500
It is time for Benoit Blanc's

1838
01:53:49,583 --> 01:53:52,750
final checkmate
over the mysteries of faith!

1839
01:54:21,291 --> 01:54:23,291
Blanc, are you... Are you okay?

1840
01:54:25,416 --> 01:54:26,625
Damascus.

1841
01:54:27,666 --> 01:54:28,875
Damascus?

1842
01:54:30,250 --> 01:54:33,208
Like... a road to Damascus thing?

1843
01:54:33,291 --> 01:54:35,250
Yes, yes, Damascus.

1844
01:54:38,791 --> 01:54:40,416
Shit.

1845
01:54:41,291 --> 01:54:42,375
Blanc?

1846
01:54:58,916 --> 01:55:00,541
I cannot solve this case.

1847
01:55:04,500 --> 01:55:05,500
What?

1848
01:55:06,583 --> 01:55:09,292
Are you saying that
your conclusion, Benoit Blanc,

1849
01:55:09,375 --> 01:55:12,333
is that Monsignor Wicks
rose from the dead?

1850
01:55:12,416 --> 01:55:13,833
That it was a miracle?

1851
01:55:13,916 --> 01:55:18,042
I'm saying I cannot solve this case.

1852
01:55:19,583 --> 01:55:20,750
That works.

1853
01:55:21,250 --> 01:55:22,083
Thank you.

1854
01:55:24,458 --> 01:55:25,541
Blanc?

1855
01:55:26,250 --> 01:55:28,583
If you know what really happened,
you should tell everyone.

1856
01:55:28,666 --> 01:55:32,375
Is this you sparing our faith
or being respectful or something?

1857
01:55:32,458 --> 01:55:34,667
Because we deserve the truth.

1858
01:55:34,750 --> 01:55:36,167
It is not.

1859
01:55:37,541 --> 01:55:39,250
I need the truth.

1860
01:55:40,541 --> 01:55:42,750
Can't you just

1861
01:55:42,833 --> 01:55:45,791
give us the answer?
Isn't that what all this is for?

1862
01:55:48,583 --> 01:55:51,458
And would you consider blurbing my book?

1863
01:55:51,541 --> 01:55:53,333
No.

1864
01:55:53,958 --> 01:55:56,592
Okay. All right.
Show's over. Everyone out.

1865
01:55:57,333 --> 01:55:59,750
Out. Out.

1866
01:56:00,458 --> 01:56:02,083
Yeah, can you stand back, sir?

1867
01:56:03,375 --> 01:56:05,000
Okay, can we keep them back...

1868
01:56:06,666 --> 01:56:09,500
I add another chapter
and then we're... we're ready.

1869
01:56:09,583 --> 01:56:11,917
We're ready to publish. Trust me, Alan.

1870
01:56:12,000 --> 01:56:14,708
Call Random House, everybody.
It's gonna be huge!

1871
01:56:17,833 --> 01:56:21,625
What we've witnessed is a miracle
confirmed by Benoit Blanc himself.

1872
01:56:21,708 --> 01:56:25,042
The world will know
what happened today here at Chimney Rock.

1873
01:56:25,125 --> 01:56:29,125
You can find out yourself.
Follow my YouTube channel @CyDraven...

1874
01:56:29,208 --> 01:56:30,500
What a mess.

1875
01:56:32,000 --> 01:56:34,416
I assume they'll arrest Father Jud now.

1876
01:56:35,000 --> 01:56:36,083
Yes.

1877
01:56:37,041 --> 01:56:38,666
I suppose they will.

1878
01:56:44,833 --> 01:56:46,333
What the hell was that?

1879
01:56:46,875 --> 01:56:48,875
Road to Damascus.

1880
01:56:49,583 --> 01:56:51,917
Scales fell from my eyes.

1881
01:56:52,000 --> 01:56:53,833
So what? Facts, schmacks?

1882
01:56:53,916 --> 01:56:56,458
You believe in God
and all this <i>mishegoss</i> is real?

1883
01:56:56,541 --> 01:56:58,375
No, no. God is a fiction.

1884
01:56:58,458 --> 01:57:00,541
My revelation came from...

1885
01:57:01,625 --> 01:57:03,041
from Father Jud.

1886
01:57:04,500 --> 01:57:06,916
His example to have grace.

1887
01:57:09,583 --> 01:57:11,416
Grace for my enemy.

1888
01:57:15,166 --> 01:57:16,541
Grace for the broken.

1889
01:57:19,000 --> 01:57:20,625
Grace for those who

1890
01:57:21,416 --> 01:57:22,541
deserve it the least.

1891
01:57:24,625 --> 01:57:26,041
But who need it the most.

1892
01:57:31,291 --> 01:57:32,500
For the guilty.

1893
01:57:33,083 --> 01:57:34,166
Mr. Blanc.

1894
01:57:34,833 --> 01:57:36,458
You know the truth.

1895
01:57:37,041 --> 01:57:39,041
I do, yes.

1896
01:57:40,583 --> 01:57:43,833
And you made yourself the fool just now.

1897
01:57:43,916 --> 01:57:46,625
So that you could do this
of your own free will.

1898
01:57:47,916 --> 01:57:50,333
And now you better do it. Quickly.

1899
01:57:50,416 --> 01:57:51,708
Thank you.

1900
01:57:55,583 --> 01:57:57,000
Father Jud.

1901
01:58:04,000 --> 01:58:05,042
What do I do?

1902
01:58:05,125 --> 01:58:06,958
What you were born to do.

1903
01:58:07,041 --> 01:58:08,541
Be her priest.

1904
01:58:09,041 --> 01:58:10,458
Take her confession.

1905
01:58:19,125 --> 01:58:21,042
Bless me, Father, for I have sinned.

1906
01:58:21,125 --> 01:58:23,416
It is a week since my last confession.

1907
01:58:27,916 --> 01:58:32,750
I told myself it started with pure intent.

1908
01:58:34,125 --> 01:58:35,541
But the truth is

1909
01:58:36,375 --> 01:58:39,458
it started with a lie.

1910
01:58:40,416 --> 01:58:41,417
Prentice.

1911
01:58:42,958 --> 01:58:43,958
<i>Prentice.</i>

1912
01:58:45,625 --> 01:58:48,625
<i>I saw him take his final communion.</i>

1913
01:58:52,500 --> 01:58:54,625
This is Eve's Apple, Martha.

1914
01:58:55,208 --> 01:58:57,416
My entire cursed fortune.

1915
01:58:57,916 --> 01:59:00,250
All the sin in the world.

1916
01:59:00,333 --> 01:59:02,333
All that Eve hungers for.

1917
01:59:03,000 --> 01:59:04,625
I have trapped it.

1918
01:59:05,208 --> 01:59:08,625
It shall never again
be plucked by evil hands.

1919
01:59:09,416 --> 01:59:11,333
The body of Christ.

1920
01:59:24,458 --> 01:59:27,792
<i>He took the jewel to his grave.</i>

1921
01:59:30,625 --> 01:59:35,291
<i>I swore that I would
protect this great secret.</i>

1922
01:59:36,708 --> 01:59:40,542
<i>But Grace, she discovered that
he had bought the diamond.</i>

1923
01:59:40,625 --> 01:59:41,917
I don't know how.

1924
01:59:42,000 --> 01:59:43,916
She knew her fancy brands.

1925
01:59:45,166 --> 01:59:48,417
<i>What would come
in a custom-made Fabergé box,</i>

1926
01:59:48,500 --> 01:59:50,667
<i>itself worth maybe $20,000?</i>

1927
01:59:50,750 --> 01:59:54,833
<i>Not a trinket or a plastic Jesus, no.</i>

1928
01:59:54,916 --> 01:59:57,166
<i>Something facet-cut, worth a fortune.</i>

1929
01:59:58,250 --> 01:59:59,250
<i>A jewel.</i>

1930
01:59:59,333 --> 02:00:02,042
But she didn't know where he hid it.

1931
02:00:02,125 --> 02:00:03,708
So that night...

1932
02:00:06,166 --> 02:00:08,291
<i>She didn't desecrate the church in anger.</i>

1933
02:00:08,875 --> 02:00:11,833
<i>No, she was looking for
the hidden jewel.</i>

1934
02:00:11,916 --> 02:00:15,500
<i>A dark life of desperation.</i>

1935
02:00:16,041 --> 02:00:19,125
<i>A prisoner to shame and judgment.</i>

1936
02:00:19,625 --> 02:00:21,625
<i>It was her one way out.</i>

1937
02:00:22,625 --> 02:00:24,041
That poor girl.

1938
02:00:25,583 --> 02:00:27,416
Martha, what did you say to her?

1939
02:00:29,541 --> 02:00:31,292
I know where he hid it.

1940
02:00:31,375 --> 02:00:33,417
And you'll never find it.

1941
02:00:33,500 --> 02:00:35,000
You harlot whore.

1942
02:00:40,208 --> 02:00:42,042
Where is it?

1943
02:00:44,750 --> 02:00:47,208
Where is it, you little shit?

1944
02:00:48,208 --> 02:00:51,208
I kept the secret of Eve's Apple

1945
02:00:51,291 --> 02:00:55,958
locked in my heart for 60 years.

1946
02:00:57,125 --> 02:00:59,750
My terrible burden.

1947
02:01:00,958 --> 02:01:03,083
Until...

1948
02:01:05,083 --> 02:01:07,167
I challenged you to confess it.

1949
02:01:07,250 --> 02:01:10,708
<i>With defiant pride,</i>

1950
02:01:11,750 --> 02:01:13,166
<i>I confessed.</i>

1951
02:01:16,750 --> 02:01:18,375
To the wrong priest.

1952
02:01:22,583 --> 02:01:24,542
Time is of the essence now.

1953
02:01:24,625 --> 02:01:26,625
Last Sunday, in the rectory,

1954
02:01:26,708 --> 02:01:29,875
<i>Vera confronted Wicks
and you learned about Cy.</i>

1955
02:01:29,958 --> 02:01:32,917
I could accept that he had strayed.

1956
02:01:33,000 --> 02:01:36,791
<i>But as he spoke, something became clear.</i>

1957
02:01:37,708 --> 02:01:39,916
<i>This was something much bigger.</i>

1958
02:01:40,416 --> 02:01:44,833
<i>He was embracing that terrible boy.</i>

1959
02:01:46,541 --> 02:01:48,583
<i>That's when I suspected.</i>

1960
02:01:48,666 --> 02:01:51,042
So you call the construction company.

1961
02:01:51,125 --> 02:01:52,625
{\an8}Thank you, James.

1962
02:01:54,875 --> 02:01:56,192
{\an8}<i>And I was certain.</i>

1963
02:01:57,000 --> 02:02:00,333
<i>He had ordered the equipment
to open the crypt</i>

1964
02:02:00,416 --> 02:02:06,250
<i>to steal the diamond
for his own greed and lust for power.</i>

1965
02:02:06,333 --> 02:02:10,875
<i>The corrupting sin
of Eve's Apple would be unearthed</i>

1966
02:02:11,541 --> 02:02:13,875
{\an8}<i>and this church would fall</i>

1967
02:02:13,958 --> 02:02:18,583
<i>because of everything
Prentice had warned me about.</i>

1968
02:02:18,666 --> 02:02:20,166
<i>I had failed him.</i>

1969
02:02:22,750 --> 02:02:23,958
All my life,

1970
02:02:24,583 --> 02:02:27,916
I was not the bad one. I was the good one.

1971
02:02:28,500 --> 02:02:30,000
The faithful one.

1972
02:02:30,083 --> 02:02:32,791
Serving and protecting the church.

1973
02:02:33,416 --> 02:02:36,417
If I failed in that, what is my life?

1974
02:02:36,500 --> 02:02:37,583
I understand.

1975
02:02:37,666 --> 02:02:40,292
My sole purpose

1976
02:02:40,375 --> 02:02:41,875
and I failed.

1977
02:02:42,958 --> 02:02:44,166
Unless...

1978
02:02:48,166 --> 02:02:49,125
Unless...

1979
02:02:51,833 --> 02:02:55,500
<i>Unless I could...
I could steal the jewel first</i>

1980
02:02:55,583 --> 02:02:57,416
<i>and get rid of it forever.</i>

1981
02:02:58,416 --> 02:02:59,750
<i>And with the same stroke,</i>

1982
02:02:59,833 --> 02:03:04,083
<i>raise Wicks up
as a miraculous risen saint.</i>

1983
02:03:04,166 --> 02:03:07,666
{\an8}<i>Not a fallible man, but a symbol</i>

1984
02:03:08,500 --> 02:03:10,500
{\an8}<i>that would save my church.</i>

1985
02:03:11,666 --> 02:03:14,208
<i>All it would take is a miracle.</i>

1986
02:03:15,583 --> 02:03:17,416
So I formed my plan.

1987
02:03:18,416 --> 02:03:22,500
Wicks' death must be a holy mystery.

1988
02:03:23,291 --> 02:03:26,375
Unsolvable and divine.

1989
02:03:27,375 --> 02:03:29,125
But you couldn't do it alone.

1990
02:03:29,833 --> 02:03:30,916
No.

1991
02:03:32,458 --> 02:03:34,083
<i>A weak man, I thought.</i>

1992
02:03:34,666 --> 02:03:35,792
<i>Desperate.</i>

1993
02:03:35,875 --> 02:03:38,625
<i>Someone who would fall in line
to save the church</i>

1994
02:03:38,708 --> 02:03:41,375
<i>and stay in line to cover his shame.</i>

1995
02:03:41,958 --> 02:03:45,833
And who had access
to medical-grade tranquilizers.

1996
02:03:45,916 --> 02:03:48,041
Yes. And that.

1997
02:03:51,458 --> 02:03:54,416
<i>It all went according to plan.</i>

1998
02:03:56,000 --> 02:03:58,000
<i>Oh, God.</i>

1999
02:03:58,083 --> 02:03:59,167
<i>My vanity.</i>

2000
02:03:59,250 --> 02:04:00,750
So wicked.

2001
02:04:01,291 --> 02:04:02,416
Martha.

2002
02:04:03,041 --> 02:04:05,500
I understand, I promise, I do.

2003
02:04:06,083 --> 02:04:07,833
Keep going. I'm here.

2004
02:04:07,916 --> 02:04:10,375
I didn't reckon the cost.

2005
02:04:11,458 --> 02:04:13,291
Forgive me, Samson.

2006
02:04:13,833 --> 02:04:16,167
Strong Samson, faithful Samson.

2007
02:04:16,250 --> 02:04:18,875
Samson. Who made the coffins.

2008
02:04:21,541 --> 02:04:23,833
Shit.

2009
02:04:24,625 --> 02:04:26,041
You will rise again.

2010
02:04:27,000 --> 02:04:28,750
It will be okay.

2011
02:04:28,833 --> 02:04:30,541
You will rise again.

2012
02:04:31,125 --> 02:04:33,292
It will be okay.

2013
02:04:35,333 --> 02:04:36,625
I promise.

2014
02:04:37,333 --> 02:04:40,458
<i>He didn't understand why we were doing it.</i>

2015
02:04:40,541 --> 02:04:43,458
Anything for you, my angel.

2016
02:04:44,208 --> 02:04:45,525
<i>But he trusted me.</i>

2017
02:04:45,875 --> 02:04:47,708
<i>Because he loved me.</i>

2018
02:04:48,375 --> 02:04:50,500
Oh, Lord.

2019
02:04:55,250 --> 02:04:57,083
How did it go so wrong?

2020
02:04:59,666 --> 02:05:01,667
<i>It was supposed to be so simple.</i>

2021
02:05:01,750 --> 02:05:03,708
<i>The doctor gives the signal.</i>

2022
02:05:16,208 --> 02:05:18,625
<i>Samson retrieves the jewel.</i>

2023
02:05:19,875 --> 02:05:22,708
<i>The Lazarus door serves its purpose.</i>

2024
02:05:26,791 --> 02:05:30,166
<i>All caught on camera the way we planned.</i>

2025
02:05:30,791 --> 02:05:33,583
<i>Dr. Nat would drive off
with Wicks' body in his truck</i>

2026
02:05:34,500 --> 02:05:37,750
<i>and dispose of it
in that nasty gook in his cellar.</i>

2027
02:05:37,833 --> 02:05:41,917
<i>And the next day, Samson would
tell the tale of the risen saint</i>

2028
02:05:42,000 --> 02:05:46,000
<i>and his word of blessing
to his faithful groundskeeper</i>

2029
02:05:46,083 --> 02:05:49,000
<i>before ascending back into heaven.</i>

2030
02:05:49,666 --> 02:05:51,083
<i>A miracle.</i>

2031
02:05:51,666 --> 02:05:53,500
<i>It would have been perfect.</i>

2032
02:05:55,416 --> 02:05:57,458
I wasn't supposed to be there.

2033
02:05:57,541 --> 02:05:59,666
You most certainly were not.

2034
02:06:00,458 --> 02:06:01,458
Did you know

2035
02:06:01,541 --> 02:06:04,625
what had happened
when you found Samson's body?

2036
02:06:04,708 --> 02:06:06,417
I had an idea.

2037
02:06:06,500 --> 02:06:08,583
No, no!

2038
02:06:09,250 --> 02:06:11,083
But I had to be sure.

2039
02:06:14,541 --> 02:06:15,750
Praise be.

2040
02:06:16,250 --> 02:06:17,458
It's accomplished.

2041
02:06:35,958 --> 02:06:39,291
Oh. Oh. Oh.

2042
02:06:42,208 --> 02:06:44,125
<i>Then he told me the fairy tale</i>

2043
02:06:44,208 --> 02:06:47,291
<i>of how everything
had gone according to plan.</i>

2044
02:06:48,750 --> 02:06:52,208
<i>It was only then that I told him
I'd been to the crypt.</i>

2045
02:06:54,000 --> 02:06:56,666
<i>And I knew he was lying.</i>

2046
02:06:58,416 --> 02:07:00,541
<i>And then he told me the truth.</i>

2047
02:07:05,333 --> 02:07:07,750
Shit. We can't let him see us.

2048
02:07:16,333 --> 02:07:17,541
Jesus.

2049
02:07:20,541 --> 02:07:22,166
<i>My second mistake.</i>

2050
02:07:22,666 --> 02:07:27,291
<i>Underestimating the temptation
of Eve's Apple.</i>

2051
02:07:28,541 --> 02:07:32,917
<i>Our agreed mission was to destroy it
or throw it in the sea.</i>

2052
02:07:33,000 --> 02:07:37,500
<i>But all this power will I give thee.</i>

2053
02:07:38,416 --> 02:07:41,458
<i>Christ himself could resist temptation,</i>

2054
02:07:41,541 --> 02:07:44,833
<i>but this desperate little man,</i>

2055
02:07:45,333 --> 02:07:48,541
<i>all that stood in his way
was Samson and I.</i>

2056
02:07:49,375 --> 02:07:51,375
<i>Now, here was his opportunity.</i>

2057
02:07:52,250 --> 02:07:55,417
To remove his obstacles.

2058
02:07:56,500 --> 02:08:00,500
Frame a young priest with a violent past

2059
02:08:00,583 --> 02:08:02,500
and keep the jewel.

2060
02:08:04,458 --> 02:08:05,208
He took it.

2061
02:08:09,833 --> 02:08:13,708
<i>Then all that remained in his way was me.</i>

2062
02:08:14,708 --> 02:08:19,291
<i>He had poisoned my coffee
with a lethal dose of pentobarbital.</i>

2063
02:08:20,208 --> 02:08:22,833
<i>No remedy once ingested.</i>

2064
02:08:23,583 --> 02:08:24,833
<i>Mm, painless.</i>

2065
02:08:24,916 --> 02:08:27,833
<i>A little numbness in the lips.</i>

2066
02:08:28,500 --> 02:08:31,583
<i>Then in ten minutes,
time for your final prayer.</i>

2067
02:08:32,416 --> 02:08:35,583
<i>Then he begged me to understand
why he was doing all this.</i>

2068
02:08:35,666 --> 02:08:39,125
<i>That the money would lure back
his harpy wife,</i>

2069
02:08:39,208 --> 02:08:41,125
<i>blah, blah, blah.</i>

2070
02:08:41,833 --> 02:08:44,083
<i>I told him I understood.</i>

2071
02:08:45,416 --> 02:08:47,416
<i>I understood why he did it.</i>

2072
02:08:48,708 --> 02:08:49,791
Oh.

2073
02:08:51,875 --> 02:08:54,500
<i>I had understood it all.</i>

2074
02:09:14,708 --> 02:09:16,708
<i>These things I did with</i>

2075
02:09:17,458 --> 02:09:20,083
<i>hatred in my heart.</i>

2076
02:09:25,166 --> 02:09:27,583
<i>Vengeance is mine, said the Lord.</i>

2077
02:09:33,125 --> 02:09:36,625
<i>And that is the story the crime
scene will tell the world, but...</i>

2078
02:09:39,500 --> 02:09:41,416
<i>...inside my heart,</i>

2079
02:09:42,166 --> 02:09:43,375
<i>I know.</i>

2080
02:09:47,458 --> 02:09:49,083
Vengeance is mine.

2081
02:09:52,916 --> 02:09:56,417
These sins I confess to you, Father.

2082
02:09:56,500 --> 02:09:59,791
I have lied,
I have killed,

2083
02:10:00,500 --> 02:10:01,708
and now

2084
02:10:02,708 --> 02:10:05,250
I have topped it all off
with a real doozy.

2085
02:10:13,000 --> 02:10:14,542
Father. Quickly now, quickly.

2086
02:10:14,625 --> 02:10:15,917
What's happening?

2087
02:10:16,000 --> 02:10:18,125
I knew when I saw her lips...

2088
02:10:20,166 --> 02:10:21,792
<i>it was already too late.</i>

2089
02:10:23,708 --> 02:10:25,625
She's taken the pentobarbital.

2090
02:10:25,708 --> 02:10:28,625
-Oh. Oh, God. Call the ambulance now!
-On it!

2091
02:10:28,708 --> 02:10:31,208
There might be a poison kit
in the prowler!

2092
02:10:42,708 --> 02:10:44,333
Forgive me, Father,

2093
02:10:45,541 --> 02:10:46,958
for all you have endured.

2094
02:10:48,625 --> 02:10:53,458
Forgive me, Lord, for...
for Wicks and Nat and...

2095
02:10:55,666 --> 02:10:56,875
Samson.

2096
02:10:57,500 --> 02:10:59,125
My sweet Samson.

2097
02:11:00,208 --> 02:11:01,416
And Grace.

2098
02:11:06,000 --> 02:11:08,083
Martha.

2099
02:11:08,833 --> 02:11:10,041
Grace.

2100
02:11:12,625 --> 02:11:13,833
You're safe now.

2101
02:11:16,666 --> 02:11:17,875
Let it go.

2102
02:11:19,458 --> 02:11:21,083
Let the hatred go.

2103
02:11:26,458 --> 02:11:27,541
Grace.

2104
02:11:31,208 --> 02:11:32,333
Yes.

2105
02:11:33,208 --> 02:11:34,625
I see it now.

2106
02:11:36,541 --> 02:11:38,166
That poor girl.

2107
02:11:41,333 --> 02:11:43,166
Forgive me, Grace.

2108
02:11:47,375 --> 02:11:48,583
Father...

2109
02:11:51,583 --> 02:11:53,125
you're really good at this.

2110
02:11:58,708 --> 02:12:00,875
God, the father of mercies,

2111
02:12:01,625 --> 02:12:04,042
through the death
and resurrection of His Son

2112
02:12:04,125 --> 02:12:06,833
has reconciled the world to Himself

2113
02:12:07,583 --> 02:12:11,750
and poured out the Holy Spirit
for the forgiveness of sins,

2114
02:12:12,583 --> 02:12:14,417
and through the ministry of the Church,

2115
02:12:14,500 --> 02:12:17,000
may God grant you pardon and peace,

2116
02:12:18,000 --> 02:12:20,208
and I absolve you of your sins.

2117
02:12:28,000 --> 02:12:31,208
In the name of the Father and of the Son

2118
02:12:32,291 --> 02:12:33,708
and the Holy Spirit.

2119
02:12:49,416 --> 02:12:50,500
Shit.

2120
02:13:20,041 --> 02:13:21,875
<i>The jewel was never found.</i>

2121
02:13:26,125 --> 02:13:27,625
{\an8}<i>The church closed for a while.</i>

2122
02:13:28,541 --> 02:13:31,708
{\an8}<i>The flock,
what was left of them, scattered.</i>

2123
02:13:32,291 --> 02:13:37,833
{\an8}<i>Some got what they wanted only to discover
the one thing every holy man knows...</i>

2124
02:13:42,208 --> 02:13:43,833
{\an8}<i>God has a sense of humor.</i>

2125
02:13:49,375 --> 02:13:51,791
<i>And some got a fresh start.</i>

2126
02:13:52,458 --> 02:13:55,291
<i>Maybe to find a path
that's theirs, I hope so.</i>

2127
02:13:59,041 --> 02:14:00,666
<i>And some got their miracle.</i>

2128
02:14:01,958 --> 02:14:04,375
<i>Not being cured or fixed,</i>

2129
02:14:05,041 --> 02:14:08,042
<i>but finding the sustaining power
to wake up every day</i>

2130
02:14:08,125 --> 02:14:10,333
<i>and do what we're here to do</i>

2131
02:14:11,208 --> 02:14:12,833
<i>in spite of the pain.</i>

2132
02:14:14,000 --> 02:14:15,208
<i>Daily bread.</i>

2133
02:14:22,541 --> 02:14:24,541
And that's what I pray for with you.

2134
02:14:25,416 --> 02:14:27,333
That you find what you're looking for.

2135
02:14:30,708 --> 02:14:33,250
-Where is it? You know.
-No! Cy, Cy!

2136
02:14:33,333 --> 02:14:35,083
Goddamn it, I know you both know.

2137
02:14:35,166 --> 02:14:37,583
This is your last chance
or we're gonna drag you into court.

2138
02:14:37,666 --> 02:14:39,417
Mr. Wicks, control yourself.

2139
02:14:39,500 --> 02:14:42,125
We'd hoped this mediation
would resolve this matter.

2140
02:14:42,208 --> 02:14:44,208
She gave it to them
and they're hiding it. I know.

2141
02:14:44,291 --> 02:14:47,458
We've allowed your representatives to
search the church and rectory thoroughly.

2142
02:14:47,541 --> 02:14:49,167
They found nothing.

2143
02:14:49,250 --> 02:14:51,667
Also, Mr. Blanc was there
when Martha passed

2144
02:14:51,750 --> 02:14:53,833
and he denies anything untoward.

2145
02:14:55,416 --> 02:14:58,250
Hey.

2146
02:14:58,750 --> 02:14:59,833
Hey!

2147
02:15:00,416 --> 02:15:03,208
Any hint you've sold it, any big
charity donations, you fix the roof,

2148
02:15:03,291 --> 02:15:06,292
you upgrade your shitty communion wine,
I will watch,

2149
02:15:06,375 --> 02:15:08,708
I will audit, I will find out.

2150
02:15:09,541 --> 02:15:11,958
I hope you come back
to the church someday, Cy.

2151
02:15:12,500 --> 02:15:14,625
Your real inheritance is in Christ.

2152
02:15:25,500 --> 02:15:28,208
Little punk bitch.

2153
02:15:32,375 --> 02:15:34,417
His video with you is still trending.

2154
02:15:34,500 --> 02:15:35,583
Yes.

2155
02:15:35,666 --> 02:15:37,875
"Benoit Blanc 'pwned'."

2156
02:15:37,958 --> 02:15:40,875
Owned with a "P". Whatever that means.

2157
02:15:41,500 --> 02:15:43,333
We keep pushing the facts out there.

2158
02:15:43,416 --> 02:15:46,875
Martha, what really happened.
But it doesn't seem to matter.

2159
02:15:47,458 --> 02:15:51,291
Wicks truthers keep flooding our Facebook.
It's an outhouse fire.

2160
02:15:52,625 --> 02:15:54,458
Such a time to be alive.

2161
02:15:55,416 --> 02:15:58,041
You're gonna be
very popular once you open.

2162
02:15:58,750 --> 02:16:00,250
Maybe not in a good way.

2163
02:16:00,333 --> 02:16:01,916
Are you ready to take that on?

2164
02:16:03,708 --> 02:16:04,791
Let 'em come.

2165
02:16:07,375 --> 02:16:08,458
Good luck, kid.

2166
02:16:11,791 --> 02:16:13,958
Listen, uh... Um...

2167
02:16:14,458 --> 02:16:16,833
I'm...
I'm... I'm gonna go.

2168
02:16:22,250 --> 02:16:23,875
Hmm.

2169
02:16:26,750 --> 02:16:30,917
Uh, my first Mass is coming up if...
if you wanna stick around.

2170
02:16:31,000 --> 02:16:32,917
Um... That's so nice of you.

2171
02:16:33,000 --> 02:16:37,167
There is, uh...
nothing I would rather not do.

2172
02:16:37,250 --> 02:16:38,541
