29
00:05:44,278 --> 00:05:47,281
You had to pick the middle of
nowhere.

Hello!

47
00:07:47,435 --> 00:07:48,369
Excuse me!

48
00:07:48,402 --> 00:07:50,538
Aah!
- Oh, whoa! Oh!

49
00:07:50,571 --> 00:07:52,206
(chuckles) Hey there.

50
00:07:52,239 --> 00:07:56,143
Oh, my! Sorry about that.
I didn't mean to scare ya.

51
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:01,782
(breathing heavily)
What are you doing up here?

52
00:08:02,950 --> 00:08:03,985
Fishing.

53
00:08:05,419 --> 00:08:06,921
Just a little fishing.

54
00:08:08,689 --> 00:08:09,790
By yourself?

55
00:08:10,791 --> 00:08:11,826
Yeah.

56
00:08:14,061 --> 00:08:16,464
Used to come up here
with my husband, though.

57
00:08:17,365 --> 00:08:18,599
Long time ago.

58
00:08:24,805 --> 00:08:28,376
You wouldn't happen to know
where a Lake Hilda is, would ya?

59
00:08:29,643 --> 00:08:30,678
Yeah.

60
00:08:35,282 --> 00:08:37,151
Just back over the hill here.

61
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:42,023
If you're driving,
you gotta go the long way round.

62
00:08:42,456 --> 00:08:43,924
Okey-doke.

63
00:08:43,958 --> 00:08:45,292
Sure appreciate it.

64
00:08:48,329 --> 00:08:49,363
Say...

65
00:08:50,131 --> 00:08:51,465
You doin' OK?

66
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,635
Just thought I...

(panting softly)

68
00:08:59,607 --> 00:09:00,841
Deer.

69
00:09:01,142 --> 00:09:02,343
OK.

70
00:09:03,844 --> 00:09:05,479
Well, stay warm.

71
00:09:10,618 --> 00:09:12,653

playing)

(distant voices)

79
00:10:11,078 --> 00:10:12,880
(man) It's a lot easier.

80
00:10:12,913 --> 00:10:14,748
(woman) Yeah.
- (man) All right.

81
00:10:21,155 --> 00:10:22,923
(rumbling)
Oh!

82
00:10:26,595 --> 00:10:30,364
(sighs) Are you sure it's safe
out here? - Oh, yeah, yeah.

83
00:10:30,397 --> 00:10:33,267
Got to be seven or eight inches,
easy. Look, look.

84
00:10:34,201 --> 00:10:35,870
(rumbling)
- (He chuckles.)

85
00:10:35,903 --> 00:10:39,541
Ain't helping your case any. -
Oh, we'll be fine. I promise...

86
00:10:39,574 --> 00:10:43,110
Oh!
- (Both laugh.)

87
00:10:43,144 --> 00:10:45,079
(soft music playing)

88
00:11:20,948 --> 00:11:23,851
(She groans, sighs.)

89
00:11:23,884 --> 00:11:27,188
(man) Come on. Do you always
give up that easy, huh?

90
00:11:28,557 --> 00:11:31,926
This thing's a piece of junk.
- No, it ain't.

91
00:11:31,959 --> 00:11:32,993
Here.

92
00:11:34,495 --> 00:11:35,530
Come on.

93
00:11:39,733 --> 00:11:41,769
(She sniffs.)

94
00:11:46,608 --> 00:11:48,809
(She sniffs, sighs.)

95
00:11:50,077 --> 00:11:52,346
(She sniffs, inhales deeply.)

96
00:11:57,552 --> 00:11:58,819
No, other way.

97
00:12:02,122 --> 00:12:04,124
(She groans.)

98
00:12:04,858 --> 00:12:06,561
There you go.
- OK.

99
00:12:07,629 --> 00:12:09,263
Jeez, you can get off me now.

100
00:12:09,296 --> 00:12:11,633
OK.
- (Both chuckle.)

101
00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:18,707
(string music continues)

102
00:12:33,787 --> 00:12:35,823
(melancholic music playing)

103
00:12:53,173 --> 00:12:56,076
Know where Greta Larsen's
boyfriend took her on their
first date?

104
00:12:56,678 --> 00:12:57,778
No.

105
00:12:58,479 --> 00:12:59,514
Where?

106
00:13:00,047 --> 00:13:01,081
Dancin'.

107
00:13:01,982 --> 00:13:04,653
Mm-hm.
- Down at the VFW.

108
00:13:04,686 --> 00:13:06,954
Are you tryin' to say somethin'
here?

109
00:13:06,987 --> 00:13:08,989
Just statin' facts is all.

110
00:13:09,023 --> 00:13:10,525
Oh, yeah? Skol.

111
00:13:11,559 --> 00:13:12,926
Skol, Karl.

112
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:20,434
(melancholic music playing)

113
00:13:31,912 --> 00:13:33,947
(She sniffs softly.)

114
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:41,155
Oh...

115
00:13:42,624 --> 00:13:44,793
(distant gunshot)

116
00:13:47,394 --> 00:13:49,430
(Man shouts in distance)

117
00:13:52,567 --> 00:13:55,302
(Man, in the distance) No! Get
back here, you little bitch!

118
00:14:07,782 --> 00:14:09,784
(gunshot)

119
00:14:09,818 --> 00:14:11,919
(Bird squawks.)

120
00:14:11,952 --> 00:14:14,188
(She groans.)

121
00:14:16,990 --> 00:14:19,126
(Man groans.)

122
00:14:25,633 --> 00:14:28,435
(gunshot)
- (Girl screams.)

123
00:14:28,469 --> 00:14:32,005
(man) Next shot I won't miss.
Stupid little bitch!

124
00:14:32,973 --> 00:14:36,110
Try that again... and you're
dead.

125
00:14:37,679 --> 00:14:38,879
Do you hear me?

126
00:14:40,515 --> 00:14:42,650
(Girl screams.)

127
00:14:42,684 --> 00:14:44,151
(man) Do you hear me?

128
00:14:49,691 --> 00:14:51,892
(She pants anxiously.)

129
00:14:55,496 --> 00:14:58,065
(man speaking indistinctly in
distance)

130
00:15:01,101 --> 00:15:03,370
Oh... (panting)

131
00:15:04,839 --> 00:15:08,041
(tense music playing)

132
00:15:11,245 --> 00:15:13,414
(Tires screech.)

133
00:15:17,951 --> 00:15:20,688
(Music intensifies.)

134
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:28,462
Come on, come on.

135
00:15:34,234 --> 00:15:37,505
(engine revving)
You gotta be kidding me!

136
00:15:49,283 --> 00:15:51,452
(She sighs deeply.)

137
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:53,487
(wind whistling)

138
00:15:54,889 --> 00:15:56,858
(She sniffs, sighs.)

139
00:15:58,860 --> 00:16:01,729
(She groans, pants.)

140
00:16:05,999 --> 00:16:08,035
(She sniffs.)

141
00:16:12,172 --> 00:16:14,843
Yeah, I know, I know!

142
00:16:24,284 --> 00:16:26,320
(distant wind whistling)

143
00:16:46,841 --> 00:16:48,877

144
00:16:54,248 --> 00:16:56,283
(Engine starts.)

145
00:17:06,895 --> 00:17:08,796
(panting)

146
00:17:23,611 --> 00:17:25,647
(She continues panting.)

147
00:17:38,693 --> 00:17:40,728
(She groans, sniffs.)

148
00:17:43,698 --> 00:17:46,000
(panting)

149
00:17:51,973 --> 00:17:54,008
(wind whistling)

150
00:18:00,414 --> 00:18:02,449
(Girl whimpers loudly.)

151
00:18:10,625 --> 00:18:12,660
(She grunts.)

152
00:18:15,228 --> 00:18:16,263
Oh...

153
00:18:20,233 --> 00:18:21,502
You hurt?

154
00:18:24,237 --> 00:18:25,472
You alone?

155
00:18:26,507 --> 00:18:28,676
(cars approaching)
- (Girl whimpers.)

156
00:18:33,347 --> 00:18:36,618
Oh! - (Girl whimpers, pants
anxiously.)

157
00:18:44,525 --> 00:18:46,561
(tense music playing)

158
00:18:57,471 --> 00:18:59,507
(She sighs.)

159
00:19:03,745 --> 00:19:06,413
(Car door closes.)
- (indistinct conversation)

160
00:19:23,163 --> 00:19:24,464
She down there?

161
00:19:25,933 --> 00:19:27,068
Yeah.

162
00:19:27,101 --> 00:19:29,137
(panting)

163
00:19:30,270 --> 00:19:32,305
(girl whimpering)

164
00:19:33,608 --> 00:19:36,209
Any snags?
- (man) Nope.

165
00:19:36,243 --> 00:19:37,512
You sure?

166
00:19:37,545 --> 00:19:40,815
She was where you said she'd be,
coming out of the pharmacy.

167
00:19:40,848 --> 00:19:43,151
Grabbed her in the alley. No one
saw shit.

168
00:19:43,851 --> 00:19:45,452
You didn't feed her, did ya?

169
00:19:46,854 --> 00:19:49,157
Course not. Think I'm an idiot?

170
00:19:51,793 --> 00:19:53,493
You're not gonna say thank you?

171
00:19:53,528 --> 00:19:55,596
For what?
- I don't know.

172
00:19:55,630 --> 00:19:56,496
Gettin' the girl?

173
00:19:57,598 --> 00:20:01,268
Breaking into St Luke's and
stealing half their supply
closet?

174
00:20:01,301 --> 00:20:03,336
(She sniffs, sighs.)

175
00:20:04,371 --> 00:20:06,206
(man) Driving out to find your
ass?

176
00:20:07,508 --> 00:20:10,210
Digging your truck out of the
snow?

177
00:20:10,243 --> 00:20:14,615
You'd still be out there
freezing your tits off if I
hadn't gone looking for you.

178
00:20:14,649 --> 00:20:17,819
What the fuck? I said no booze!

179
00:20:18,986 --> 00:20:23,157
I'm not fucking around! You can
get as drunk as you want when
we're done.

180
00:20:23,191 --> 00:20:25,793
I'm not drunk!
- (woman) Enough!

181
00:20:25,827 --> 00:20:27,995
I'm gonna rest while you sober
up.

182
00:20:28,696 --> 00:20:30,565
Then we can unpack the truck.

183
00:20:31,699 --> 00:20:34,168
(She groans.)

184
00:20:38,673 --> 00:20:41,142
(whispering) Hon!
- (Girl whimpers.)

185
00:20:41,175 --> 00:20:43,310
(panting)

186
00:20:43,343 --> 00:20:45,345
(window squeaking)

187
00:20:51,719 --> 00:20:54,088
(tense music playing)

188
00:20:58,192 --> 00:21:00,393
(Girl continues panting.)

189
00:21:06,667 --> 00:21:08,703
(Barb panting)

190
00:21:13,608 --> 00:21:16,276
(whispering) OK?
- (girl panting)

191
00:21:22,517 --> 00:21:24,552
(ominous music playing)

192
00:21:56,784 --> 00:21:58,653
(dramatic music playing)

193
00:22:11,364 --> 00:22:13,267
(Door creaks open.)

194
00:22:14,702 --> 00:22:16,604
(Woman groans.)

195
00:22:20,473 --> 00:22:22,510
(distant wind gusting)

196
00:22:23,611 --> 00:22:26,047
(Woman groans, pants.)

197
00:22:29,717 --> 00:22:31,652
(She continues panting.)

198
00:22:39,492 --> 00:22:41,629
(tense music playing)

199
00:22:53,241 --> 00:22:55,509
(girl whimpering)

200
00:23:12,326 --> 00:23:14,461
(tense music intensifies)

201
00:23:14,494 --> 00:23:15,529
Fuck!

202
00:23:19,033 --> 00:23:20,534
What the fuck is this?

203
00:23:21,569 --> 00:23:23,537
Um, a mitten?

204
00:23:23,571 --> 00:23:26,674
Yeah, I know it's a fucking
mitten. Where'd it come from?

205
00:23:27,975 --> 00:23:30,778
The mitten store?
- Are you trying to piss me off?

206
00:23:30,811 --> 00:23:33,114
Whose is it?
- I don't know.

207
00:23:33,147 --> 00:23:37,184
A lady stopped by. She maybe
dropped it. - A fucking lady
stopped by?

208
00:23:37,218 --> 00:23:40,821
Yeah, some dumb old bitch. - You
didn't think that was pertinent?

209
00:23:40,855 --> 00:23:45,192
It was two seconds. She didn't
see shit. - Well, she clearly
fucking did!

210
00:23:45,226 --> 00:23:46,360
What did she want?

211
00:23:46,394 --> 00:23:48,461
I gave her directions to the
lake.

212
00:23:51,498 --> 00:23:56,737
I don't know how many times I
have to tell you to stop being
so nice to people.

213
00:23:56,771 --> 00:23:58,471
They take advantage.

214
00:23:58,506 --> 00:24:00,241
Well, she was lost.
- Come on!

215
00:24:00,741 --> 00:24:02,243
Well, where are we going?

216
00:24:02,276 --> 00:24:04,412
To tidy up your fucking mess!

217
00:24:06,948 --> 00:24:08,983
(tense music playing)

218
00:25:14,915 --> 00:25:16,884
(Gun clicks.)

219
00:25:24,792 --> 00:25:26,193
Aagh!

220
00:25:28,329 --> 00:25:31,365
Oh! Oh, shit!
- (Woman shouts.)

221
00:25:33,601 --> 00:25:34,835
Come here! Over here.

222
00:25:34,869 --> 00:25:37,338
Get me out!
- Give me your fucking hand!

223
00:25:37,638 --> 00:25:40,574
Aagh! Holy shit!
- I'll help you. Come on!

224
00:25:40,608 --> 00:25:43,811
Oh, shit!
- Come on! Come on!

225
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:53,754
Hello?

226
00:25:55,122 --> 00:25:57,091
(Door closes.)

227
00:26:05,366 --> 00:26:06,400
Holy...

228
00:26:08,702 --> 00:26:10,738
(She grunts, pants.)

229
00:26:16,310 --> 00:26:19,548
(She groans.)
- (Girl whimpers.)

230
00:26:20,181 --> 00:26:22,216
(groaning)

231
00:26:24,652 --> 00:26:26,454
It's OK, hon.

232
00:26:26,487 --> 00:26:28,557
(coughing) It's OK.

233
00:26:29,558 --> 00:26:31,826
(groaning) I'm the...

234
00:26:31,859 --> 00:26:33,928
I'm the lady from the window.

235
00:26:34,728 --> 00:26:35,763
Oh!

236
00:26:37,698 --> 00:26:39,366
Took a tumble there.

237
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:42,069
(She groans, pants.)

238
00:26:42,103 --> 00:26:43,804
Let's get that off ya.

239
00:26:45,106 --> 00:26:48,543
(Girl whimpers.)
- It's real stuck.

240
00:26:49,376 --> 00:26:52,213
OK, let's just do it fast. OK.

241
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:54,415
One, two, three.

242
00:26:54,448 --> 00:26:57,685
(Girl groans loudly.) - Sorry.
Oh, my gosh, I'm so sorry.

243
00:26:57,718 --> 00:27:01,021
Oh, sweetheart, where's the key?
Where's the key, honey?

244
00:27:01,055 --> 00:27:03,023
I don't know.
- Damn!

245
00:27:03,057 --> 00:27:04,959
Sorry. Didn't mean to cuss.

246
00:27:09,697 --> 00:27:11,899
Don't leave. Please don't leave
me!

247
00:27:11,932 --> 00:27:15,369
No, no, no, no.
I'm not leavin' you, sweetie.

248
00:27:15,402 --> 00:27:17,539
I'm not leavin' ya.

249
00:27:17,572 --> 00:27:19,440
A promise is a promise.

250
00:27:19,473 --> 00:27:23,777
I'm just gonna find something to
get you out of those cuffs. Just
hang tight now.

251
00:27:28,782 --> 00:27:29,817
Oh...

252
00:27:33,588 --> 00:27:34,623
Oh!

253
00:27:47,067 --> 00:27:49,103
(haunting, tense music)

254
00:28:35,883 --> 00:28:37,918
(She groans, pants.)

255
00:28:40,387 --> 00:28:42,223
(gunshot)
- Aagh!

256
00:28:44,024 --> 00:28:46,227
(gunshot)
- Oh!

257
00:28:47,828 --> 00:28:49,564
(gunshot)

258
00:28:54,268 --> 00:28:56,170
(panting)

259
00:29:02,042 --> 00:29:04,713
(Woman sighs, pants.)

260
00:29:08,749 --> 00:29:10,084
Oh, agh...

261
00:29:11,018 --> 00:29:12,152
Agh...

262
00:29:15,422 --> 00:29:16,991
(gunshot)

263
00:29:19,460 --> 00:29:21,495
(gunshot)

264
00:29:24,633 --> 00:29:27,901
(Gun clicks.)
Who the fuck is this cow?

265
00:29:36,844 --> 00:29:38,178
Jesus!

266
00:29:38,212 --> 00:29:39,714
Fuck!

267
00:29:45,219 --> 00:29:46,887
Shit!

268
00:29:47,622 --> 00:29:49,990
(Woman gasps.)

269
00:29:51,992 --> 00:29:54,361
(Woman pants.)

270
00:29:54,395 --> 00:29:56,430
(Girl pants anxiously.)

271
00:29:57,097 --> 00:29:59,199
It's fuckin' freezin' in here.

272
00:29:59,233 --> 00:30:01,569
Do we have any more matches?
- The cupboard.

273
00:30:01,603 --> 00:30:03,772
I'm checking the fucking
cupboard!

274
00:30:04,606 --> 00:30:07,575
Oh, goddamn it, where's our
bags? - (Man groans.)

275
00:30:07,609 --> 00:30:08,809
Bitch!

276
00:30:10,044 --> 00:30:10,978
Fuck!

277
00:30:11,546 --> 00:30:13,280
Look for something dry!

278
00:30:14,516 --> 00:30:16,317
There's got to be something.

279
00:30:17,284 --> 00:30:21,355
Maybe I'll just take a hot bath.
- No, you're hypothermic. It'll
kill you.

280
00:30:21,690 --> 00:30:24,892
We need to strip you down and
warm you up slowly with a dry
heat.

281
00:30:24,925 --> 00:30:27,762
There's blankets in my truck.
Fucking-A right!

282
00:30:27,796 --> 00:30:29,731
(panting)

283
00:30:36,837 --> 00:30:39,373
(She pants more loudly.)

284
00:30:40,775 --> 00:30:42,811
(She whimpers.)

285
00:30:46,113 --> 00:30:48,415
(panting)

286
00:30:50,884 --> 00:30:52,920
(She whimpers.)

287
00:30:54,689 --> 00:30:56,924
(panting)

288
00:31:08,202 --> 00:31:10,137
Uff da. (sniffs)

289
00:31:10,170 --> 00:31:12,072
(Bird squawks.)
Oh...

290
00:31:16,377 --> 00:31:18,580
(groaning)

291
00:31:29,323 --> 00:31:30,357
Oh!

292
00:31:31,593 --> 00:31:33,728
Eeh! (panting)

293
00:31:33,762 --> 00:31:36,631
(She groans.)

294
00:31:40,401 --> 00:31:42,903
(panting) Oh, oh!

295
00:31:42,936 --> 00:31:45,038
Oh... Oh!

296
00:31:45,072 --> 00:31:47,107
(panting heavily)

297
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:56,350
(groaning and panting)

298
00:31:56,383 --> 00:31:57,819
Oh, oh...

299
00:31:58,419 --> 00:32:00,889
Oh! Uh, uh...

300
00:32:04,091 --> 00:32:05,959
(breathing heavily)

301
00:32:12,567 --> 00:32:14,669
(wind whistling)
- (She groans.)

302
00:32:24,111 --> 00:32:26,146
(She whimpers.)

303
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:35,355
(panting)

304
00:32:36,156 --> 00:32:38,292
Oh! (sniffs)

305
00:32:38,325 --> 00:32:40,360
(She sighs.)

306
00:32:42,496 --> 00:32:46,634
(Karl) Hey, do me a favor and
grab me one of those grub-barb
lures.

307
00:32:46,668 --> 00:32:49,470
Should be in the tackle box
in the bottom left.

308
00:32:53,273 --> 00:32:55,877
Why, did your legs stop working?
- Hmm?

309
00:32:57,779 --> 00:32:59,814
(soft music playing)

310
00:33:39,019 --> 00:33:40,320
Will you?

311
00:33:58,472 --> 00:34:01,009
(She chuckles softly.)

312
00:34:01,643 --> 00:34:03,678
(She sniffs, sighs.)

313
00:34:10,350 --> 00:34:12,486
(She groans.)

314
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:15,422
(wind whistling)
- (She groans.)

315
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:22,396
(She sighs.)

316
00:34:23,230 --> 00:34:25,265
(She grunts.)

317
00:34:27,769 --> 00:34:29,971
You gotta be kiddin' me.
(sniffs)

318
00:34:35,944 --> 00:34:38,145
(She grunts, sighs.)

319
00:34:46,921 --> 00:34:49,057
(She grunts loudly.)

320
00:34:49,089 --> 00:34:51,124
(wind whistling)

321
00:34:54,762 --> 00:34:56,898
(panting)

322
00:35:09,142 --> 00:35:10,979
(engine rumbling)

323
00:35:30,632 --> 00:35:33,635
(She groans.)

324
00:35:37,505 --> 00:35:39,239
Fuck!
- Oh...

325
00:35:39,272 --> 00:35:40,842
We're running out of time.

326
00:35:41,976 --> 00:35:45,312
I've got pins and needles in my
skin.

327
00:35:46,014 --> 00:35:50,084
You need to get your ass in gear
and get all the supplies down to
the lake.

328
00:35:50,118 --> 00:35:52,386
Get everything set up.
(Engine stops.)

329
00:35:52,419 --> 00:35:55,123
Right now? I'm... I'm freezing,
though.

330
00:35:55,188 --> 00:35:56,991
We don't have a choice.

331
00:35:58,291 --> 00:36:02,063
Just give me a feckin' minute
here. My clothes ain't even dry.

332
00:36:02,096 --> 00:36:06,067
There ain't fucking time. We
need to get to Littlefork by
morning!

333
00:36:08,002 --> 00:36:11,806
You know what happens
if we miss this fucking surgeon.

334
00:36:11,839 --> 00:36:13,306
O-OK.

335
00:36:13,340 --> 00:36:14,474
OK.

336
00:36:14,509 --> 00:36:15,643
OK.

337
00:36:15,677 --> 00:36:17,712
(wind whistling)

338
00:36:20,447 --> 00:36:23,718
(man) Why don't we just do it
here?

339
00:36:23,751 --> 00:36:26,486
The environment needs to be
pristine.

340
00:36:27,121 --> 00:36:31,626
Well, let's just clean it
and get some bleach and shit.

341
00:36:31,659 --> 00:36:35,697
Which one of us spent the last
fucking decade working in an
O.R.?

342
00:36:36,764 --> 00:36:38,566
Yeah...
- I know what I'm doing.

343
00:36:38,599 --> 00:36:42,704
Plus, I can't have her bleeding
all over my grandma's cabin.

344
00:36:43,771 --> 00:36:46,473
We're doing it on the lake for a
reason.

345
00:36:46,507 --> 00:36:48,142
I know, but...

346
00:36:48,176 --> 00:36:53,047
The cops can't investigate a
crime scene that isn't gonna
exist tomorrow.

347
00:36:53,915 --> 00:36:55,049
Yeah?

348
00:36:55,083 --> 00:36:56,216
(man) Mm-hm.

349
00:36:56,249 --> 00:36:58,052
Where's it gonna go?

350
00:36:58,086 --> 00:36:59,954
(groans) Bottom of the lake.

351
00:37:01,022 --> 00:37:05,059
(sighs) Once we... torch and
sink it.

352
00:37:05,093 --> 00:37:06,293
(woman) Exactly.

353
00:37:08,629 --> 00:37:10,497
(Man groans.)
- Hey.

354
00:37:10,531 --> 00:37:12,365
(Man groans.)

355
00:37:13,634 --> 00:37:15,469
I really need you right now.

356
00:37:21,475 --> 00:37:23,410
(She sighs.)
- Where are you goin'?

357
00:37:23,443 --> 00:37:26,413
I'm goin' to get the girl.
She's not safe here any more.

358
00:37:26,446 --> 00:37:29,751
Then I'll find that bitch and
put a bullet in her fucking
head!

359
00:37:29,784 --> 00:37:31,819
(footsteps going downstairs)

360
00:37:34,188 --> 00:37:36,190
(suspenseful music playing)

361
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:42,230
(groaning)
- (Door creaks.)

362
00:37:53,074 --> 00:37:54,909
(woman) Get in.

363
00:37:54,942 --> 00:37:56,944
(He grunts, sighs.)

364
00:38:06,521 --> 00:38:08,122
(man) Holy shit!

365
00:38:13,995 --> 00:38:15,462
Where's my gun?

366
00:38:15,495 --> 00:38:19,366
You are such a goddamn moron,
it defies believability!

367
00:38:19,399 --> 00:38:21,536
It's not my fault, babe. I
just...

368
00:38:21,569 --> 00:38:23,971
Ow! - Stop feeling sorry for
yourself!

369
00:38:24,005 --> 00:38:26,240
(He groans.)
- Move!

370
00:38:27,041 --> 00:38:29,977
I'll bring her to the lake
when you're set up.

371
00:38:30,011 --> 00:38:32,079
(Door slams.)
- Fuck!

372
00:38:32,113 --> 00:38:34,115
(Engine revs.)

373
00:38:34,148 --> 00:38:36,150
(tense music playing)

374
00:38:56,237 --> 00:38:58,272
(Man groans.)

375
00:39:04,477 --> 00:39:06,614
(clanking)

376
00:39:08,381 --> 00:39:10,618
(Barb) What the heck is he
doin'?

377
00:39:16,257 --> 00:39:18,391
(vehicle approaching)

378
00:39:18,425 --> 00:39:20,460
(engine revving)

379
00:39:22,663 --> 00:39:24,232
(She groans.)

380
00:39:24,265 --> 00:39:25,867
(Door closes.)

381
00:39:28,102 --> 00:39:30,137
(She grunts, pants.)

382
00:39:32,607 --> 00:39:34,709
(panting)

383
00:39:40,147 --> 00:39:42,183
(Door creaks.)

384
00:39:42,683 --> 00:39:44,719
(Door closes.)

385
00:39:45,353 --> 00:39:46,854
Hon? Hon?

386
00:39:52,526 --> 00:39:54,562
(panting)

387
00:40:03,571 --> 00:40:04,972
(She groans.)

388
00:40:09,176 --> 00:40:10,477
Oh, yeah.

389
00:40:14,548 --> 00:40:16,918
(She sighs, groans.)

390
00:40:18,319 --> 00:40:19,553
Oh!

391
00:40:19,587 --> 00:40:21,589
(She sighs.)

392
00:40:22,223 --> 00:40:23,257
Oh!

393
00:40:24,225 --> 00:40:26,260
(She groans softly.)

394
00:40:30,564 --> 00:40:32,566
(She gulps.)

395
00:40:37,838 --> 00:40:39,874
(groaning)

396
00:40:43,911 --> 00:40:45,112
God!

397
00:40:51,419 --> 00:40:53,721
(She takes deep breath.)

398
00:40:53,754 --> 00:40:54,789
Aaargh!

399
00:40:55,790 --> 00:40:58,693
(She groans, whimpers.)

400
00:41:02,997 --> 00:41:04,131
God...

401
00:41:04,165 --> 00:41:06,200
(She sighs deeply.)

402
00:41:10,204 --> 00:41:12,239
(panting softly)

403
00:41:21,415 --> 00:41:23,150
Steady. Come on.

404
00:41:30,124 --> 00:41:32,126
(She groans.)

405
00:41:34,562 --> 00:41:37,497
(She pants, groans.)

406
00:41:45,973 --> 00:41:47,975
(She sniffs, sighs.)

407
00:41:48,743 --> 00:41:50,644
(panting) Jeez...

408
00:41:53,014 --> 00:41:54,815
Just like sewing a quilt.

409
00:41:55,282 --> 00:42:00,054
(groans) A really gross, bloody
quilt.

410
00:42:00,087 --> 00:42:02,323
(She groans, whimpers.)

411
00:42:02,356 --> 00:42:04,825
(She gasps.)

412
00:42:04,859 --> 00:42:05,926
Aagh...

413
00:42:07,795 --> 00:42:10,031
(She sobs, whimpers.)

414
00:42:11,966 --> 00:42:14,835
(She breathes sharply.)

415
00:42:18,305 --> 00:42:21,042
Oh, boy. Come on, come on. Come
on.

416
00:42:21,075 --> 00:42:23,310
(panting)

417
00:42:28,149 --> 00:42:30,384
(She groans sharply.)

418
00:42:30,418 --> 00:42:32,620
(panting)

419
00:42:34,622 --> 00:42:37,691
(She groans loudly.)

420
00:42:39,326 --> 00:42:41,362
(She whimpers.)

421
00:42:45,633 --> 00:42:47,668
(groaning sharply)

422
00:42:56,511 --> 00:42:58,547
(panting)

423
00:43:00,381 --> 00:43:02,416
(Scissors clatter.)

424
00:43:04,618 --> 00:43:06,353
(groaning)

425
00:43:13,327 --> 00:43:14,962
Aagh...

426
00:43:14,995 --> 00:43:17,331
(Glasses clatter.)

427
00:43:22,203 --> 00:43:24,238
(She sighs softly.)

428
00:43:32,113 --> 00:43:33,948
(wind whistling)

429
00:43:48,929 --> 00:43:51,132
(She grunts.)

430
00:43:51,165 --> 00:43:53,467
(sighs) Oh!

431
00:43:53,501 --> 00:43:54,735
Oh, oh.

432
00:43:56,070 --> 00:43:58,105
(She grunts.)

433
00:44:00,174 --> 00:44:02,143
(She sniffs, sighs.)

434
00:44:03,578 --> 00:44:05,580
(She grunts.)

435
00:44:08,550 --> 00:44:09,584
Oh!

436
00:44:12,554 --> 00:44:14,989
(She grunts.)

437
00:44:18,225 --> 00:44:19,260
Of course.

438
00:44:21,262 --> 00:44:22,997
Oh!

439
00:44:23,030 --> 00:44:25,399
(breathes sharply) Oh!

440
00:44:26,535 --> 00:44:28,669
(She grunts loudly.)

441
00:44:28,702 --> 00:44:30,237
Uff da. Oh!

442
00:44:34,708 --> 00:44:36,744
(radio crackling)

443
00:44:39,346 --> 00:44:41,650
(She sniffs, pants.)

444
00:44:41,682 --> 00:44:43,884
God... dang it!

445
00:44:43,918 --> 00:44:44,952
Hello!

446
00:44:45,786 --> 00:44:48,255
Hello?
(crackling)

447
00:44:48,289 --> 00:44:50,090
Anyone out there?

448
00:44:50,124 --> 00:44:52,426
It's an emergency.

449
00:44:52,459 --> 00:44:53,662
Anyone?

450
00:44:54,929 --> 00:44:57,298
Please! Hello!

451
00:44:58,600 --> 00:45:00,701
Hello. Hello...

452
00:45:00,734 --> 00:45:04,305
Frickin'... fiddlesticks! Shit
buns!

453
00:45:04,338 --> 00:45:05,406
(male voice) <i>Whoa there!</i>

454
00:45:05,439 --> 00:45:08,075
<i>I'm sure it can't be</i>
<i>as bad as all that.</i>

455
00:45:08,108 --> 00:45:12,514
Oh, hello. Can you hear me? <i>-</i>
<i>Loud and clear. What's the</i>
<i>trouble?</i>

456
00:45:12,547 --> 00:45:15,282
Oh! There's been a kidnapping.

457
00:45:15,316 --> 00:45:18,352
These two loonies, they took
this girl.

458
00:45:18,385 --> 00:45:21,722
I... I need help. I'm wounded
and I...

459
00:45:21,755 --> 00:45:24,892
<i>Slow down. Slow down there.</i>
<i>What's your location?</i>

460
00:45:24,925 --> 00:45:29,129
Uh, a cabin near Lake Hilda.

461
00:45:29,163 --> 00:45:31,232
<i>Lake what now?</i>
- Hilda!

462
00:45:31,265 --> 00:45:35,069
It's off of Route 11. It's
just... It's south a few
miles...

463
00:45:35,102 --> 00:45:37,539
Uh, just outside Beltrami
County.

464
00:45:37,572 --> 00:45:40,609
<i>OK, yeah, I... I think we might</i>
<i>not be too far...</i>

465
00:45:40,642 --> 00:45:42,142
OK, can you just get...

466
00:45:42,176 --> 00:45:44,178
(She screams.)

467
00:45:46,747 --> 00:45:49,049
(grunting and groaning)

468
00:45:49,684 --> 00:45:50,652
Oh, fuck!

469
00:45:50,685 --> 00:45:52,820
Aagh! Fuck!

470
00:45:53,555 --> 00:45:57,224
(She grunts.)
- Oh, fucking hell!

471
00:45:57,258 --> 00:46:00,194
(groans) Oh, fuck!

472
00:46:00,227 --> 00:46:01,128
Aagh!

473
00:46:01,563 --> 00:46:03,931
Oh, fuck. Don't, don't...

474
00:46:03,964 --> 00:46:07,234
Don't kill me. Please don't kill
me. - Why are you doing this?

475
00:46:07,835 --> 00:46:09,671
It's my... my wife.

476
00:46:09,704 --> 00:46:11,506
She made me do it.

477
00:46:12,806 --> 00:46:14,542
I didn't want any...

478
00:46:15,309 --> 00:46:17,244
She... she's sick.

479
00:46:17,278 --> 00:46:18,713
And th-that girl...

480
00:46:19,648 --> 00:46:22,349
She tried to kill herself

481
00:46:22,950 --> 00:46:24,586
more than once.

482
00:46:25,286 --> 00:46:27,021
She don't wanna live.

483
00:46:27,054 --> 00:46:30,324
Maybe... Maybe she don't deserve
to.

484
00:46:30,357 --> 00:46:32,960
Well, that's not really up to
you now, is it?

485
00:46:32,993 --> 00:46:36,096
I ain't a bad... person.

486
00:46:36,130 --> 00:46:37,699
I ain't... Please don't...

487
00:46:37,732 --> 00:46:41,368
All right, all right, cut it
out. - (He whimpers.)

488
00:46:42,671 --> 00:46:45,172
Oh!
- (He groans loudly.)

489
00:46:46,741 --> 00:46:49,109
(He mutters indistinctly.)

490
00:46:50,210 --> 00:46:51,680
Where'd she take the girl?

491
00:46:52,079 --> 00:46:54,783
Out looking for... for you.

492
00:46:55,015 --> 00:46:57,318
(panting)

493
00:46:57,384 --> 00:47:00,120
I was gonna... l-leave

494
00:47:00,354 --> 00:47:04,124
and... go to the hospital.

495
00:47:05,359 --> 00:47:07,895
I'm... I'm hypothermic.

496
00:47:07,928 --> 00:47:11,398
I'm done help... helping her.

497
00:47:13,033 --> 00:47:14,868
I just... I just need

498
00:47:15,369 --> 00:47:19,306
to get to... a doctor.

499
00:47:19,340 --> 00:47:22,777
Stop that. Stop that.
Don't move. Don't move!

500
00:47:23,043 --> 00:47:24,878
(panting rapidly)

501
00:47:27,948 --> 00:47:29,083
Is this...

502
00:47:30,351 --> 00:47:31,485
yours?

503
00:47:31,519 --> 00:47:34,088
Oh! (breathing heavily)

504
00:47:36,791 --> 00:47:39,993
Oh!
- I found it... in the cabin.

505
00:47:41,195 --> 00:47:43,230
(soft music playing)

506
00:47:52,640 --> 00:47:53,608
Oh, oh...

507
00:47:55,409 --> 00:47:57,144
OK... (sniffs)

508
00:47:58,879 --> 00:48:01,014
(panting)

509
00:48:01,048 --> 00:48:02,784
What's the nearest town?

510
00:48:03,718 --> 00:48:05,486
W-Wannaska.

511
00:48:05,520 --> 00:48:07,421
Ab-about two hours.

512
00:48:09,156 --> 00:48:10,924
You say you ain't a bad person?

513
00:48:10,958 --> 00:48:12,627
No.

514
00:48:12,660 --> 00:48:14,696
Then you're gonna prove it to
me.

515
00:48:14,729 --> 00:48:17,599
You're gonna drive like hell
till we hit Wannaska.

516
00:48:17,632 --> 00:48:19,900
And go straight to the police
station.

517
00:48:19,933 --> 00:48:22,136
You tell 'em to send
the whole dang force.

518
00:48:22,169 --> 00:48:25,038
Then, and only then, do you find
your way to the doctor.

519
00:48:25,072 --> 00:48:27,241
You got that?
- I will.

520
00:48:27,274 --> 00:48:29,878
Don't make me regret this.
- I won't.

521
00:48:29,910 --> 00:48:32,781
Yeah, OK.
- I swear.

522
00:48:32,814 --> 00:48:34,481
All right, well, get goin'.

523
00:48:34,516 --> 00:48:35,550
Thank you.

524
00:48:36,316 --> 00:48:38,352
(He groans.)

525
00:48:38,787 --> 00:48:40,889
(Door slams.)
OK...

526
00:48:40,921 --> 00:48:43,892
(She pants.)
- (He groans.)

527
00:48:43,924 --> 00:48:45,959
(He mumbles indistinctly.)

528
00:48:48,696 --> 00:48:50,998
(He mumbles.)

529
00:48:51,965 --> 00:48:53,367
Here.

530
00:48:56,704 --> 00:48:58,071
OK...

531
00:49:01,275 --> 00:49:02,744
Thank you.

532
00:49:02,777 --> 00:49:05,479
(He groans.)

533
00:49:12,219 --> 00:49:14,254
(Door closes.)
- (She sighs.)

534
00:49:14,823 --> 00:49:16,858
(Engine starts.)

535
00:49:22,630 --> 00:49:24,666
(ominous music playing)

536
00:49:50,892 --> 00:49:52,627
(Man groans loudly.)

537
00:49:53,994 --> 00:49:56,029
(grunting)

538
00:50:01,536 --> 00:50:03,671
(wind whistling)

539
00:50:03,705 --> 00:50:05,740
(car rattling)

540
00:50:09,744 --> 00:50:12,045
(He groans loudly.)

541
00:50:13,815 --> 00:50:15,850
(Brakes squeak.)

542
00:50:19,353 --> 00:50:21,656
(He shivers.)

543
00:50:21,689 --> 00:50:23,691
(engines running)

544
00:50:29,096 --> 00:50:31,131
(Engine stops.)

545
00:50:33,835 --> 00:50:35,837
(engine running)

546
00:50:39,641 --> 00:50:42,877
(Handbrake creaks.)
- (Girl whimpers.)

547
00:50:42,944 --> 00:50:44,913
(man groaning softly)

548
00:50:47,314 --> 00:50:49,017
No, no, no, no.

549
00:50:49,049 --> 00:50:51,819
No, no!
- What the fuck are you doing?

550
00:50:51,853 --> 00:50:54,454
Fuck! - Why aren't you on the
lake setting up?

551
00:50:54,488 --> 00:50:57,825
(man) It's all set up, but...
- (woman) But what?

552
00:50:57,859 --> 00:50:59,827
(man) I... Look at me.

553
00:51:00,595 --> 00:51:02,864
(groaning) I need help.

554
00:51:02,897 --> 00:51:05,165
(woman) Then you come to me.

555
00:51:05,198 --> 00:51:07,434
I'm your wife. You come to me!

556
00:51:08,468 --> 00:51:11,138
Like I went to you. That's what
we do.

557
00:51:11,171 --> 00:51:14,341
You made a fucking vow
and you're gonna run out on me?

558
00:51:14,374 --> 00:51:16,243
Now when I need you most?

559
00:51:16,644 --> 00:51:19,847
No... - When you know what
happens if this...

560
00:51:20,582 --> 00:51:25,085
You know exactly what happens.
We have to make this work.

561
00:51:26,688 --> 00:51:28,623
(panting softly)

562
00:51:34,394 --> 00:51:36,263
It ain't gonna work.

563
00:51:42,169 --> 00:51:44,539
This whole thing, it's...

564
00:51:45,707 --> 00:51:47,909
fucking batshit.

565
00:51:52,013 --> 00:51:54,147
What other choice do I have?

566
00:51:59,152 --> 00:52:01,756
I'm not giving up.
Not when there's a chance.

567
00:52:02,757 --> 00:52:05,459
We just need to make it to
Littlefork. - OK.

568
00:52:06,694 --> 00:52:08,228
OK.
- Yeah.

569
00:52:09,764 --> 00:52:11,799
Say we make it...

570
00:52:13,400 --> 00:52:15,536
(He groans softly.)

571
00:52:15,570 --> 00:52:20,407
Are you even sure
you can trust this surgeon?

572
00:52:21,976 --> 00:52:25,747
Are you even sure he's gonna be
there?

573
00:52:30,150 --> 00:52:32,120
Let's just leave this shit.

574
00:52:33,655 --> 00:52:35,089
It ain't too late.

575
00:52:36,658 --> 00:52:38,325
We can walk away.

576
00:52:39,093 --> 00:52:41,129
(She pants.)

577
00:52:46,466 --> 00:52:48,636
(She coughs, groans.)

578
00:52:54,307 --> 00:52:56,144
We walk away and then what?

579
00:52:58,245 --> 00:53:01,381
Just wait for me to die
and you're rid of me?

580
00:53:02,850 --> 00:53:07,320
Is that what you want? - No,
it... it ain't like that,
babe...

581
00:53:07,354 --> 00:53:08,355
The fuck it ain't!

582
00:53:22,202 --> 00:53:24,237
(She sighs softly.)

583
00:53:28,943 --> 00:53:30,978
(She sniffs.)

584
00:53:39,153 --> 00:53:41,189
(She groans softly.)

585
00:53:44,058 --> 00:53:46,060
(groaning)

586
00:53:50,131 --> 00:53:52,734
(She grunts.)

587
00:53:56,369 --> 00:53:58,106
(She groans.)

588
00:54:07,247 --> 00:54:09,951
(soft music playing)

589
00:54:25,265 --> 00:54:27,267
(She grunts.)

590
00:54:29,871 --> 00:54:31,906
(She groans loudly.)

591
00:54:34,008 --> 00:54:35,042
Karl!

592
00:54:36,177 --> 00:54:38,311
(panting)

593
00:54:38,613 --> 00:54:39,647
Karl!

594
00:54:42,049 --> 00:54:44,919
(She groans.)
- Hon? Hon?

595
00:54:46,654 --> 00:54:49,090
We need to go to the hospital.
- Whoa, whoa.

596
00:54:49,924 --> 00:54:50,958
In, in, in.

597
00:54:58,498 --> 00:54:59,934
OK.

598
00:55:02,270 --> 00:55:04,404
(She grunts loudly.)

599
00:55:06,641 --> 00:55:08,676
(ominous music playing)

600
00:55:27,528 --> 00:55:29,496
(Music intensifies.)

601
00:55:43,778 --> 00:55:45,813
(soft music playing)

602
00:55:55,923 --> 00:55:57,490
(Karl) <i>We'll keep trying.</i>

603
00:56:00,493 --> 00:56:01,696
We won't quit.

604
00:56:06,868 --> 00:56:08,836
(ominous music playing)

605
00:56:21,381 --> 00:56:24,118
(She groans, pants.)

606
00:56:36,163 --> 00:56:38,366
(panting)

607
00:56:45,405 --> 00:56:47,541
(She sniffs.)

608
00:56:47,575 --> 00:56:48,976
Come on.

609
00:56:50,878 --> 00:56:52,780
Come on, you stinker!

610
00:56:54,215 --> 00:56:56,250
(panting softly)

611
00:56:59,220 --> 00:57:02,623
Oh, jeez, ya stupid, frickin'...

612
00:57:02,657 --> 00:57:04,959
(She grunts, groans.)

613
00:57:08,262 --> 00:57:09,730
Oh... Oh!

614
00:57:13,801 --> 00:57:15,903
(explosion echoes)

615
00:57:20,675 --> 00:57:22,777
(wind whistling)

616
00:57:22,810 --> 00:57:24,845
(engine rumbling)

617
00:57:31,185 --> 00:57:32,219
Hey!

618
00:57:33,521 --> 00:57:36,057
(panting)

619
00:57:36,090 --> 00:57:38,025
Oh! Hey, hey!

620
00:57:38,526 --> 00:57:40,895
Ah, ah...

621
00:57:40,928 --> 00:57:43,531
Hey! Hey! Hey!

622
00:57:43,564 --> 00:57:45,166
Hey, hey...

623
00:57:45,199 --> 00:57:48,069
(Brakes screech.)
- Oh, oh...

624
00:57:48,102 --> 00:57:50,237
(She pants loudly.)

625
00:57:50,271 --> 00:57:53,674
Hey, I'm the CB lady.
I called you on the CB...

626
00:57:53,708 --> 00:57:57,311
Keep your hands up where we can
see 'em! Both of 'em, up!

627
00:57:57,345 --> 00:58:01,082
Sorry, sorry. It's just it's
kinda... It's kinda difficult.

628
00:58:02,183 --> 00:58:03,451
Stop!

629
00:58:03,483 --> 00:58:07,221
(panting) It's kinda... It's
kinda difficult at the moment.

630
00:58:14,494 --> 00:58:16,297
OK, you can put 'em down.

631
00:58:16,330 --> 00:58:18,599
(She continues panting.)

632
00:58:18,632 --> 00:58:23,738
Oh, am I glad to see you boys! -
What the hell happened over
there?

633
00:58:23,771 --> 00:58:27,274
Had to blow my truck up,
so you could find me. (panting)

634
00:58:27,308 --> 00:58:29,710
It's a damn needle in a haystack
out here.

635
00:58:29,744 --> 00:58:31,345
That was you on the CB?

636
00:58:31,379 --> 00:58:34,682
Yeah, one of them kidnappers
attacked me and busted it up.

637
00:58:34,715 --> 00:58:36,250
Where is this fella now?

638
00:58:36,283 --> 00:58:40,488
I had to let him go 'cause he
got pretty sick after falling in
the lake.

639
00:58:40,521 --> 00:58:45,026
He needed a doctor, but he's not
the... It's his wife we gotta
worry about.

640
00:58:45,059 --> 00:58:47,862
She's got the girl.
And she was in the cellar.

641
00:58:47,895 --> 00:58:50,631
Then she was in the truck and
now...

642
00:58:51,332 --> 00:58:53,567
Now I... I'm not sure where she
is.

643
00:58:54,435 --> 00:58:58,406
We should probably really get
headin' back over to the cabin
right now.

644
00:58:58,439 --> 00:59:00,241
Are you armed?
- Huh?

645
00:59:00,274 --> 00:59:01,308
Are you armed?

646
00:59:02,076 --> 00:59:04,979
Oh, uh, here...

647
00:59:05,012 --> 00:59:06,914
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Whoa!

648
00:59:07,915 --> 00:59:08,883
Sorry.

649
00:59:09,583 --> 00:59:13,554
Sorry. It's only got the five
shots, though. She's got a
rifle.

650
00:59:13,587 --> 00:59:17,058
She don't hesitate to use it
neither. She got me in the arm
here.

651
00:59:17,091 --> 00:59:19,193
(She pants, sniffs.)
- Yeah.

652
00:59:19,226 --> 00:59:23,764
I'm thinking we should probably
hang on to that for you, just to
be safe.

653
00:59:23,798 --> 00:59:28,569
Oh, jeez... I'd really prefer to
keep her on me if you don't
mind.

654
00:59:28,602 --> 00:59:31,906
Listen, lady, we'll take a look
at whatever the trouble is,

655
00:59:31,939 --> 00:59:35,443
but, you know, we don't know you
from Adam, so...

656
00:59:37,044 --> 00:59:39,680
We'll keep her safe and sound
in the glove box.

657
00:59:39,713 --> 00:59:43,751
Don't worry. You... We, uh... We
can handle this for you.

658
00:59:46,487 --> 00:59:49,190
Oh... - It's that or we can
leave you here.

659
00:59:49,223 --> 00:59:50,724
What's it gonna be?

660
00:59:51,725 --> 00:59:53,528
(She sighs.)

661
00:59:56,263 --> 00:59:58,165
Get it.
- OK.

662
01:00:05,806 --> 01:00:07,808
(tense music playing)

663
01:00:38,272 --> 01:00:40,307
(Brakes squeak.)

664
01:00:47,616 --> 01:00:49,551
(engine running)

665
01:00:53,420 --> 01:00:55,256
(man 1) Just the one lady?

666
01:00:55,289 --> 01:00:58,425
(Barb) Yeah,
her husband's long gone by now.

667
01:00:58,459 --> 01:01:01,362
(man 2) What's she doing in
there? - Heck if I know.

668
01:01:02,296 --> 01:01:05,032
Maybe we should just head to
town, get the cops.

669
01:01:05,065 --> 01:01:06,400
No, it'll take hours.

670
01:01:13,207 --> 01:01:15,176
(engine rumbling)

671
01:01:17,612 --> 01:01:21,616
Let's just go talk to her,
figure out what the hell's going
on round here.

672
01:01:21,650 --> 01:01:25,953
I'm not sure that's such a smart
idea. She's dangerous as all
heck. Maybe...

673
01:01:25,986 --> 01:01:30,157
We'll have a friendly little
conversation, see what she has
to say for herself.

674
01:01:31,626 --> 01:01:35,062
(man 2) We got this. - We need
to be careful about this.

675
01:01:35,095 --> 01:01:36,964
Consider all the angles.

676
01:01:36,997 --> 01:01:38,432
You stay here.

677
01:01:39,400 --> 01:01:41,636
(She sighs.)
- (Door closes.)

678
01:01:43,572 --> 01:01:45,206
Oh, wow, heck.

679
01:01:46,774 --> 01:01:48,309
All right.

680
01:01:48,342 --> 01:01:49,376
Oh, boy.

681
01:01:50,512 --> 01:01:52,547
(ominous music playing)

682
01:02:04,526 --> 01:02:06,528
(She grunts.)

683
01:02:07,428 --> 01:02:09,564
(She sighs.)

684
01:02:21,875 --> 01:02:23,477
Howdy there!

685
01:02:23,511 --> 01:02:25,513
(engine running)

686
01:02:31,018 --> 01:02:33,254
We just want to ask you a few
questions.

687
01:02:53,742 --> 01:02:55,209
You all right in there?

688
01:03:02,517 --> 01:03:05,286
(ominous music continues)

689
01:03:19,768 --> 01:03:20,801
What the fuck?

690
01:03:22,537 --> 01:03:24,204
(gunshot)
Oh!

691
01:03:26,407 --> 01:03:28,442
Oh, please don't...

692
01:03:31,345 --> 01:03:33,414
(Man groans.)

693
01:03:33,447 --> 01:03:35,316
Oh, shit! Oh, oh!

694
01:03:39,119 --> 01:03:41,589
Ah, ah, ah, ah!

695
01:03:41,623 --> 01:03:44,425
Oh, God!
(gunshot)

696
01:03:44,458 --> 01:03:45,392
Shit!

697
01:03:47,227 --> 01:03:48,996
(gunshot)
Oh!

698
01:03:50,831 --> 01:03:53,067
(gunshot)
Uh, uh...

699
01:03:54,335 --> 01:03:56,738
(She screams, pants.)

700
01:04:00,575 --> 01:04:02,943
(Woman screams.)
- (Gun clicks.)

701
01:04:02,976 --> 01:04:05,412
(Woman screams.)
- (Barb groans.)

702
01:04:08,048 --> 01:04:10,017
(woman groaning in pain)

703
01:04:13,788 --> 01:04:16,090
(Woman screams.)

704
01:04:17,391 --> 01:04:19,426
(woman groaning)

705
01:04:23,430 --> 01:04:25,700
(gunshots)

706
01:04:25,734 --> 01:04:27,868
(Barb screams, groans.)

707
01:04:35,142 --> 01:04:37,612
(panting)

708
01:04:50,424 --> 01:04:52,594
(Barb groans.)

709
01:04:52,627 --> 01:04:54,596
(gunshot)

710
01:04:57,331 --> 01:04:59,466
(She pants loudly.)

711
01:05:05,906 --> 01:05:07,174
Aagh!

712
01:05:10,944 --> 01:05:13,046
(Barb) You awake in there?

713
01:05:14,948 --> 01:05:16,651
(man) Who's that?

714
01:05:16,885 --> 01:05:20,655
Oh, jeez, Karl, you know who it
is.

715
01:05:22,524 --> 01:05:23,792
It's your wife.

716
01:05:25,025 --> 01:05:26,226
You old coot.

717
01:05:27,961 --> 01:05:30,497
Huh? Let's get you out of there.

718
01:05:31,265 --> 01:05:32,399
Up you get.

719
01:05:32,433 --> 01:05:34,468
There you go. That's it.

720
01:05:35,537 --> 01:05:38,573
OK. Sorry, it's cold.

721
01:05:38,606 --> 01:05:40,675
(Karl groans softly.)
- Uh-huh.

722
01:05:41,643 --> 01:05:42,844
Other foot.

723
01:05:48,949 --> 01:05:51,351
Let's get this water nice and
hot.

724
01:05:56,658 --> 01:05:58,693
(soft music playing)

725
01:06:02,229 --> 01:06:05,065
You want 'em fried or poached?

726
01:06:07,367 --> 01:06:08,703
Fried it is.

727
01:06:11,004 --> 01:06:16,343
You know, I was just thinking
back to that Mille Lacs trip in
'98.

728
01:06:16,977 --> 01:06:19,079
Wish we'd got a picture of that
pike.

729
01:06:21,081 --> 01:06:22,416
What a beaut, huh?

730
01:06:24,051 --> 01:06:25,085
Still...

731
01:06:26,186 --> 01:06:28,288
we'll always know you caught
her.

732
01:06:32,025 --> 01:06:34,361
That's the most important thing.

733
01:06:34,394 --> 01:06:36,463
(oil sizzling)

734
01:06:40,300 --> 01:06:42,469
(She chuckles softly.)

735
01:06:45,907 --> 01:06:46,941
Karl?

736
01:06:52,412 --> 01:06:54,448
(melancholic music playing)

737
01:06:55,783 --> 01:06:56,818
Karl?

738
01:07:53,073 --> 01:07:56,945
(coughs) Oh!
- (girl) Hey, hey!

739
01:07:56,978 --> 01:07:59,279
(groaning)

740
01:07:59,313 --> 01:08:00,882
(girl) Are you OK?

741
01:08:04,451 --> 01:08:06,486
(Barb groans.)

742
01:08:08,155 --> 01:08:09,456
Oh, well...

743
01:08:10,157 --> 01:08:13,061
(panting) ...I'll be darned.

744
01:08:16,430 --> 01:08:17,999
She didn't kill me.

745
01:08:19,132 --> 01:08:20,535
Oh!

746
01:08:22,804 --> 01:08:24,204
Is that your blood?

747
01:08:27,441 --> 01:08:29,010
(whimpering) It's his.

748
01:08:29,043 --> 01:08:31,411
Oh... Yeah.

749
01:08:31,445 --> 01:08:33,014
What's gonna happen to us?

750
01:08:33,514 --> 01:08:35,349
I really don't know.

751
01:08:35,382 --> 01:08:37,518
(panting)

752
01:08:37,552 --> 01:08:40,120
Have you ever seen these people
before?

753
01:08:40,153 --> 01:08:42,356
The woman, maybe.

754
01:08:42,389 --> 01:08:45,392
I... I think I saw her at the
hospital back when...

755
01:08:45,425 --> 01:08:47,695
(She sobs.)

756
01:08:47,729 --> 01:08:50,031
(Girl struggles to speak) But I
tried...

757
01:08:51,532 --> 01:08:54,334
Oh, hon. Honey, hon...
- (Girl sobs.)

758
01:08:55,469 --> 01:08:57,538
Honey! Oh...

759
01:08:57,572 --> 01:08:59,874
(Girl continues sobbing.)

760
01:08:59,907 --> 01:09:02,110
I don't wanna die!

761
01:09:02,142 --> 01:09:05,680
That... that's good. That's a
good thing.

762
01:09:05,713 --> 01:09:08,448
(sobbing)
- Hey, what's your name?

763
01:09:13,688 --> 01:09:14,789
Leah.

764
01:09:15,389 --> 01:09:19,794
Leah? Oh, my husband loved that
name.

765
01:09:20,528 --> 01:09:23,463
It was right at the top of our
list. No foolin'.

766
01:09:23,497 --> 01:09:27,401
For a boy, we were thinking
Eric, and for a girl, it was
gonna be Leah.

767
01:09:28,502 --> 01:09:32,106
Between you and me,
I was sorta hopin' for a girl.

768
01:09:37,011 --> 01:09:38,813
What are we gonna do?

769
01:09:38,846 --> 01:09:40,882
(Distant door bangs, creaks.)

770
01:09:43,084 --> 01:09:44,752
I don't know.

771
01:09:51,025 --> 01:09:54,327
(Leah whimpers.)
- Oh, hon.

772
01:09:58,099 --> 01:10:01,468
Say, did you ever hear about the
Great Blizzard of 1888?

773
01:10:02,770 --> 01:10:06,107
Well, it froze half the darn
country.

774
01:10:06,140 --> 01:10:08,843
It was one of the worst
in recorded history

775
01:10:08,876 --> 01:10:11,512
and my great-grandfather Iver,

776
01:10:11,546 --> 01:10:14,782
he found himself stuck smack in
the middle of the thing.

777
01:10:14,816 --> 01:10:18,019
There was nothing but him, his
ox

778
01:10:18,052 --> 01:10:20,353
and a big sack of grain he was
carrying.

779
01:10:20,387 --> 01:10:24,726
Think he was coming back from
the mill or something, out in
Lac qui Parle County.

780
01:10:24,759 --> 01:10:26,326
Montevideo, actually.

781
01:10:26,359 --> 01:10:31,398
Anyway, he's on his way home in
the middle of this huge
snowstorm.

782
01:10:31,431 --> 01:10:36,637
Oh, oh, and by the way, hundreds
of people died in this storm.

783
01:10:36,671 --> 01:10:41,241
OK, this was not just a couple
of dainty snowflakes floating
around,

784
01:10:41,274 --> 01:10:43,310
if that's what you're thinking.

785
01:10:43,343 --> 01:10:46,214
So, the snow keeps falling and
falling.

786
01:10:46,848 --> 01:10:48,983
Iver, he can't see a damn thing.

787
01:10:49,016 --> 01:10:52,086
And he's tired, he's hungry,
but he can't stop, see?

788
01:10:52,120 --> 01:10:55,223
'Cause if he stops moving,
he's gonna freeze to death.

789
01:10:55,255 --> 01:10:56,858
So, what does he do?

790
01:10:59,994 --> 01:11:01,562
He keeps goin'.

791
01:11:02,997 --> 01:11:05,700
Simple as that. He walks.

792
01:11:06,433 --> 01:11:11,404
With that ox and that grain
through the damn blizzard,

793
01:11:11,438 --> 01:11:14,776
mile after mile after mile,
just him and that ox,

794
01:11:14,809 --> 01:11:18,179
puttin' one foot in front of the
other till, before you know it,

795
01:11:18,212 --> 01:11:21,281
the sun is peeking out through
the clouds

796
01:11:21,314 --> 01:11:23,483
and the storm's over.

797
01:11:31,893 --> 01:11:33,127
That's it?

798
01:11:33,161 --> 01:11:36,063
That's it... What, that's...

799
01:11:37,031 --> 01:11:39,834
Think about what Iver did there!

800
01:11:40,168 --> 01:11:43,604
What... If he'd given up, I
wouldn't... I wouldn't be here.

801
01:11:43,638 --> 01:11:47,008
I wouldn't even have been born.
- (Girl sniffs.)

802
01:11:47,041 --> 01:11:50,678
I never would've... I never
would've met my husband Karl.

803
01:11:50,711 --> 01:11:53,047
We never would've had the joy
of...

804
01:11:54,582 --> 01:11:56,517
spending our...

805
01:11:56,551 --> 01:11:58,252
(sobbing) ...lives together.

806
01:12:02,523 --> 01:12:04,457
Heck, all's I'm sayin' is...

807
01:12:05,526 --> 01:12:08,129
(sniffs) ...we don't know what's
comin'.

808
01:12:09,496 --> 01:12:13,034
We never really do, but it don't
matter.

809
01:12:14,334 --> 01:12:16,037
We don't quit.

810
01:12:21,843 --> 01:12:23,878
(Girl sniffs.)

811
01:12:25,046 --> 01:12:27,081
(Door slams upstairs.)

812
01:12:28,549 --> 01:12:30,551
I... I think she left.

813
01:12:32,286 --> 01:12:33,486
OK.

814
01:12:34,889 --> 01:12:36,924
(Barb groans.)

815
01:12:42,597 --> 01:12:44,632
(She sighs.)

816
01:12:45,233 --> 01:12:47,101
Oh, where...

817
01:12:47,935 --> 01:12:50,037
Oh, it's up there.

818
01:12:50,071 --> 01:12:51,438
What?
- It's up there.

819
01:12:51,471 --> 01:12:54,374
I saw her search you.
- Oh, oh.

820
01:12:54,407 --> 01:12:56,844
(panting) OK.

821
01:13:02,382 --> 01:13:04,585
(Barb groans, grunts.)

822
01:13:06,153 --> 01:13:08,189
(tense music playing)

823
01:13:09,824 --> 01:13:12,093
(She grunts.)

824
01:13:12,693 --> 01:13:14,762
(panting)

825
01:13:19,734 --> 01:13:21,969
(She pants heavily.)

826
01:13:23,070 --> 01:13:25,106
Oh! Shit.

827
01:13:26,007 --> 01:13:28,408
Sorry. Oh, shoot!

828
01:13:28,441 --> 01:13:30,144
Give me your shoes.
- What?

829
01:13:30,177 --> 01:13:32,713
Come on, quick.
She could be back any second.

830
01:13:32,747 --> 01:13:35,283
What's so important about that
box?

831
01:13:35,316 --> 01:13:36,984
That's it, good. OK.

832
01:13:38,185 --> 01:13:40,221
(panting)

833
01:13:43,024 --> 01:13:44,058
Ah!

834
01:13:45,359 --> 01:13:47,128
Yeah, okey-dokey.

835
01:13:48,629 --> 01:13:50,665
(She yells.)

836
01:13:51,632 --> 01:13:54,001
Oh, oh, ugh!

837
01:13:54,035 --> 01:13:56,037
(panting)

838
01:14:14,789 --> 01:14:17,325
(She grunts.)

839
01:14:19,492 --> 01:14:21,862
(She grunts.)

840
01:14:22,964 --> 01:14:24,131
I think I'm gonna...

841
01:14:28,135 --> 01:14:29,270
Oh, boy.

842
01:14:37,311 --> 01:14:39,447
(She grunts.)

843
01:14:39,479 --> 01:14:40,948
Getting there.

844
01:14:43,417 --> 01:14:45,453
(Metal squeaks.)

845
01:14:50,024 --> 01:14:52,059
(muttering to herself) Come on.

846
01:14:58,432 --> 01:15:00,500
Here. Souvenir.

847
01:15:04,605 --> 01:15:06,640
(Barb groans.)

848
01:15:08,009 --> 01:15:10,244
(She grunts.)

849
01:15:15,149 --> 01:15:17,184
(She yells.)

850
01:15:20,888 --> 01:15:22,923
(She yells.)

851
01:15:23,691 --> 01:15:25,726
(panting)

852
01:15:30,965 --> 01:15:33,000
(dramatic music)

853
01:15:43,644 --> 01:15:45,679
(She groans loudly.)

854
01:15:54,055 --> 01:15:55,790
Agh! Oh!

855
01:15:56,657 --> 01:15:58,826
Jesus!
- Oh...

856
01:15:58,859 --> 01:16:00,428
Oh, OK.

857
01:16:01,362 --> 01:16:03,431
(panting)

858
01:16:07,201 --> 01:16:08,402
There you go.

859
01:16:09,503 --> 01:16:11,072
Get these back on.

860
01:16:12,239 --> 01:16:14,608
(grunting, panting)

861
01:16:16,944 --> 01:16:19,080
(She groans loudly.)

862
01:16:19,113 --> 01:16:20,748
Here you go.

863
01:16:20,781 --> 01:16:25,920
(chuckles) When was the last
time someone helped you on with
your boots?

864
01:16:25,953 --> 01:16:28,222
(She chuckles softly.)

865
01:16:28,255 --> 01:16:30,057
(panting)

866
01:16:30,525 --> 01:16:31,959
Oh...

867
01:16:33,060 --> 01:16:34,095
OK.

868
01:16:43,437 --> 01:16:45,339
(She grunts, pants.)

869
01:16:46,240 --> 01:16:48,409
Oh! Oh, God.

870
01:16:48,442 --> 01:16:49,710
I...

871
01:16:49,743 --> 01:16:52,514
It's no good. Uh...

872
01:16:55,316 --> 01:16:56,617
Storm doors!
- Huh?

873
01:16:56,650 --> 01:16:59,019
Try the storm doors.
- Oh, yeah, good idea.

874
01:17:06,260 --> 01:17:08,295
(loud rattling)

875
01:17:08,896 --> 01:17:11,298
(She sighs.)

876
01:17:11,332 --> 01:17:14,101
They're rusty. I can... I can
jimmy 'em.

877
01:17:18,573 --> 01:17:19,608
Ah!

878
01:17:20,341 --> 01:17:21,709
That's gonna do it.

879
01:17:23,444 --> 01:17:26,447
OK, OK, let's get rid of this.

880
01:17:28,983 --> 01:17:30,784
OK. Right.

881
01:17:32,920 --> 01:17:34,955
(She groans, pants.)

882
01:17:37,091 --> 01:17:39,493
Jesus Christ!
(loud rattling)

883
01:17:40,294 --> 01:17:41,428
That's good.

884
01:17:41,462 --> 01:17:43,297
OK, next one.

885
01:17:46,033 --> 01:17:48,068
(She grunts loudly.)

886
01:17:49,670 --> 01:17:51,705
(rattling)

887
01:17:53,707 --> 01:17:55,743
(rattling)

888
01:17:57,878 --> 01:17:59,914
(She groans.)

889
01:18:03,817 --> 01:18:06,687
You really are one clever bitch,
ain't ya?

890
01:18:14,663 --> 01:18:16,497
(ominous music playing)

891
01:18:24,539 --> 01:18:30,411
(man) So, Karl had
an unusual request, um...

892
01:18:30,645 --> 01:18:34,748
He wanted his ashes to be, uh,
conveyed

893
01:18:34,782 --> 01:18:37,985
via this particular container,
uh...

894
01:18:38,886 --> 01:18:41,523
up to a particular lake

895
01:18:41,556 --> 01:18:43,457
up north and, uh...

896
01:18:43,490 --> 01:18:44,792
scattered there.

897
01:18:47,928 --> 01:18:49,330
Which lake?

898
01:18:52,601 --> 01:18:53,767
Um...

899
01:18:56,737 --> 01:18:58,372
Lake Hilda.
- Oh.

900
01:18:59,473 --> 01:19:02,711
(She chuckles.) - He's got a map
here for you too.

901
01:19:03,744 --> 01:19:06,146
I guess it's not too easy to
find.

902
01:19:06,180 --> 01:19:08,048
Pretty far out there, huh?

903
01:19:10,451 --> 01:19:12,587
(She chuckles.)

904
01:19:12,621 --> 01:19:14,488
Do you mind if I ask, uh...

905
01:19:15,856 --> 01:19:17,992
What's so special about Lake
Hilda?

906
01:19:25,866 --> 01:19:27,901
(ominous music playing)

907
01:19:56,230 --> 01:19:58,265
(She sighs.)

908
01:20:05,139 --> 01:20:07,174
(breathing heavily)

909
01:21:16,477 --> 01:21:18,112
(woman) Unload it.

910
01:21:30,891 --> 01:21:32,926
(Barb sniffs.)

911
01:21:38,065 --> 01:21:41,536
We need to redress that.
You're losing too much blood.

912
01:21:41,569 --> 01:21:44,138
I don't need your fucking
advice, lady.

913
01:21:44,171 --> 01:21:45,540
I know what I'm doing.

914
01:21:45,573 --> 01:21:48,142
You'll lose the whole leg
if it gets infected.

915
01:21:48,175 --> 01:21:50,911
The least of my worries.
- Because you're dying.

916
01:21:50,944 --> 01:21:53,046
That's why you take those,
right?

917
01:21:53,748 --> 01:21:56,785
I'm sorry for what you're going
through. Really, I am.

918
01:21:56,818 --> 01:22:00,655
But whatever this is,
it ain't gonna change anything.

919
01:22:00,688 --> 01:22:04,992
You're wrong. I just need to get
to Littlefork.

920
01:22:07,529 --> 01:22:09,864
Open that box and put it over
there.

921
01:22:34,689 --> 01:22:36,558
(tense music playing)

922
01:22:45,032 --> 01:22:48,636
Put her on the table. - Please,
you don't have to do this.

923
01:22:48,670 --> 01:22:51,138
Put her on the table.
- She's just a child.

924
01:22:51,171 --> 01:22:53,240
I'll take her place.
- You're too old.

925
01:22:53,273 --> 01:22:56,945
She's living on borrowed time
anyway. - That doesn't make it
right.

926
01:22:56,977 --> 01:22:59,046
I'll get you help. I'll find
money.

927
01:22:59,079 --> 01:23:02,015
I'll do anything, but don't do
this. She's just a child.

928
01:23:02,049 --> 01:23:05,820
She's got her whole life ahead
of her. - Put her on the fucking
table!

929
01:23:13,026 --> 01:23:14,061
I'm sorry.

930
01:23:16,296 --> 01:23:17,599
I'm sorry.

931
01:23:24,973 --> 01:23:26,406
On her back.

932
01:23:33,080 --> 01:23:37,552
Tape her shoulders, her hips...
and her shins.

933
01:23:37,585 --> 01:23:39,521
(Leah whimpers.)

934
01:23:58,673 --> 01:24:00,608
(breathing anxiously)

935
01:24:08,917 --> 01:24:10,952
(Fisherwoman groans.)

936
01:24:28,703 --> 01:24:30,605
(Fisherwoman grunts.)

937
01:24:40,380 --> 01:24:41,816
(woman) That's enough.

938
01:24:48,056 --> 01:24:49,323
Back up.

939
01:24:54,762 --> 01:24:56,798
(Leah whimpers.)

940
01:24:57,464 --> 01:24:59,499
(breathing heavily)

941
01:25:06,074 --> 01:25:08,710
(Leah screams.)

942
01:25:08,743 --> 01:25:11,211
(Leah sobs.)

943

(dramatic music playing)

944
01:25:18,753 --> 01:25:20,788

Please!
