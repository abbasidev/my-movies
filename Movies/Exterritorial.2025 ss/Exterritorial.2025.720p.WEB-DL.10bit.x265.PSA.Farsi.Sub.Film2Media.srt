1
00:00:25,916 --> 00:00:26,916
There, Mommy!

2
00:00:28,250 --> 00:00:30,458
- Look there!
- Here, to me!

3
00:00:34,708 --> 00:00:37,000
Mm. Thank you.

4
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:38,499
Thank you.

5
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:41,583
You know, Josh, the name of these
isn't <i>pommes</i> in America, it's...

6
00:00:43,583 --> 00:00:44,499
French...

7
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:46,415
- Hmm?
- Uh, fries.

8
00:00:46,416 --> 00:00:49,000
- Fries!
- Pass it to me, dumbass!

9
00:00:50,583 --> 00:00:51,666
Over here!

10
00:00:54,541 --> 00:00:56,790
Your papa, he always said

11
00:00:56,791 --> 00:00:59,707
that in America, the French
fries are way better.

12
00:00:59,708 --> 00:01:01,249
I'm not very sure about that.

13
00:01:01,250 --> 00:01:03,040
I'm not very sure.

14
00:01:03,041 --> 00:01:04,499
Uh-uh.

15
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:06,000
And who eats that one?

16
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:09,541
Hm. For papa, way
up high in heaven.

17
00:01:11,541 --> 00:01:12,750
Hey, come on, pop.

18
00:01:13,291 --> 00:01:14,915
It's time to put on sunscreen.

19
00:01:14,916 --> 00:01:16,999
Give it to me.
I got it, I got it.

20
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,540
To me, here. Come on.

21
00:01:18,541 --> 00:01:21,332
I got it.

22
00:01:21,333 --> 00:01:22,750
Come on. I'm open.

23
00:01:37,125 --> 00:01:39,082
Not there!

24
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:43,457
Boys, calm down!

25
00:01:43,458 --> 00:01:45,457
- Hey!
- What the fuck?

26
00:01:52,583 --> 00:01:54,583
Lady...

27
00:01:56,083 --> 00:01:57,165
Shit, dude.

28
00:02:00,291 --> 00:02:01,624
Man, are you okay?

29
00:02:03,708 --> 00:02:05,457
Get up, man.

30
00:02:05,458 --> 00:02:06,540
I'm sorry.

31
00:02:25,875 --> 00:02:26,707
{\an8}FOUR YEARS LATER

32
00:02:26,708 --> 00:02:28,874
{\an8}- Now she won't even call me.
- Really?

33
00:02:28,875 --> 00:02:31,665
I mean, I kind of get
it. I wouldn't call you either.

34
00:02:31,666 --> 00:02:34,999
- Forget about it. Just call her.
- I don't know if I can...

35
00:03:16,833 --> 00:03:17,916
Ah.

36
00:03:42,916 --> 00:03:43,915
Come on!

37
00:03:46,208 --> 00:03:47,540
We have an appointment.

38
00:03:59,708 --> 00:04:01,832
<i>Ms. Wulf,
this is Eral Güney,</i>

39
00:04:01,833 --> 00:04:04,624
<i>the journalist for the
investigative network Clarativ.</i>

40
00:04:04,625 --> 00:04:06,957
<i>I'm calling again because
I have new material</i>

41
00:04:06,958 --> 00:04:09,375
<i>concerning what happened
to you in Afghanistan.</i>

42
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:12,540
<i>I know you don't wanna
talk about it anymore,</i>

43
00:04:12,541 --> 00:04:14,707
<i>but it would really help
with my investigation</i>

44
00:04:14,708 --> 00:04:16,457
<i>if you could just watch a video.</i>

45
00:04:16,458 --> 00:04:18,207
<i>I've sent it to you via email.</i>

46
00:04:18,208 --> 00:04:21,291
<i>Do you recognize anyone
there? I look forward...</i>

47
00:04:35,041 --> 00:04:36,041
Josh?

48
00:04:39,083 --> 00:04:40,166
Josh?

49
00:04:48,083 --> 00:04:51,791
You've gotta be by Mommy,
okay? I don't wanna lose you.

50
00:04:53,625 --> 00:04:57,207
When we're in America, will
I get a baseball glove?

51
00:04:57,208 --> 00:04:59,499
- Yeah, sure.
- Will I get a room too?

52
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:01,791
- Your own, yeah.
- And a PS5?

53
00:05:03,416 --> 00:05:04,583
Nice try.

54
00:05:05,208 --> 00:05:06,708
No way, little man.

55
00:05:14,708 --> 00:05:16,915
Good morning. Please
have your passports ready.

56
00:06:11,291 --> 00:06:13,665
<i>All metal items
out of your pockets, please.</i>

57
00:06:13,666 --> 00:06:15,874
<i>Place them in the trays. Thanks.</i>

58
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:18,374
Smartphones in
here, please. Jackets separate.

59
00:06:18,375 --> 00:06:21,208
<i>All metal items
out of your pockets, please.</i>

60
00:06:25,375 --> 00:06:26,708
Next, please.

61
00:06:28,958 --> 00:06:31,082
May I take a
look in the backpack?

62
00:06:31,083 --> 00:06:32,500
- Of course.
- Okay.

63
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:35,207
Okay, next please.
<i>Deutsch</i>? English?

64
00:06:35,208 --> 00:06:36,165
English.

65
00:06:36,166 --> 00:06:38,874
- Okay.
- I'm interviewing to get an H-1 work visa.

66
00:06:38,875 --> 00:06:41,041
- Sara and Joshua Wulf.
- Okay.

67
00:06:41,833 --> 00:06:44,707
Hey, buddy. You're
American. How are you?

68
00:06:44,708 --> 00:06:47,874
- Hm?
- Hey, how are you?

69
00:06:47,875 --> 00:06:50,999
- He's shy.
- All right. You're checked in.

70
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,749
This is your number in the line.
They'll call you when they're ready.

71
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:54,915
{\an8}<i>B86.</i>

72
00:06:54,916 --> 00:06:56,665
When you're asked,
"How are you?"

73
00:06:56,666 --> 00:06:59,207
you just need to say
you're fine, that's all.

74
00:06:59,208 --> 00:07:01,415
Yeah, but what if
I'm not actually?

75
00:07:01,416 --> 00:07:03,707
Either way.

76
00:07:03,708 --> 00:07:06,999
The Americans don't actually wanna
know how you're doing in that moment.

77
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,083
That's why you just say,
"Fine." Simple as that.

78
00:07:10,666 --> 00:07:11,666
There.

79
00:07:12,833 --> 00:07:16,415
Did my papa also know any
German or only English?

80
00:07:16,416 --> 00:07:18,791
Only English.

81
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:24,458
If your papa tried to,
he'd sound super funny.

82
00:07:25,083 --> 00:07:26,083
You know how?

83
00:07:34,583 --> 00:07:37,541
Are we also living near
where my papa used to live?

84
00:07:39,666 --> 00:07:40,666
Yeah, really close.

85
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:47,707
<i>B117, counter six.</i>

86
00:07:47,708 --> 00:07:49,375
Can you please sit down?

87
00:07:52,083 --> 00:07:54,416
- Josh!
- I wanna play hide and seek!

88
00:07:55,333 --> 00:07:58,541
Josh! What are you
doing? Josh! Sorry, sorry.

89
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,708
- But I wanna play hide-and-seek!
- Stop! Cut it out.

90
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:08,666
Come on. We'll speak
to someone. Yeah?

91
00:08:14,083 --> 00:08:16,749
Excuse us. I think
we were forgotten.

92
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:19,625
- B-93.
- It all runs via the computer system.

93
00:08:20,916 --> 00:08:24,165
I've got a little boy here with me,
and it's already been three hours.

94
00:08:24,166 --> 00:08:26,000
There's a playground
down the hall.

95
00:08:32,708 --> 00:08:34,957
A PlayStation!

96
00:08:34,958 --> 00:08:37,124
Can I stay here, Mommy? Please?

97
00:08:37,125 --> 00:08:39,665
Okay, but not too long, or we'll
miss our number when they call.

98
00:08:39,666 --> 00:08:43,083
Yeah, but I'll just be here when
you're ready. Please, Mommy.

99
00:08:43,583 --> 00:08:46,665
Well, okay,
for ten minutes.

100
00:08:46,666 --> 00:08:49,874
But no whining when I
come to get you. Deal?

101
00:08:49,875 --> 00:08:51,333
Deal!

102
00:08:52,625 --> 00:08:54,124
I'm just gonna go get a coffee.

103
00:09:22,083 --> 00:09:26,208
<i>B93, counter six.</i>

104
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,125
Josh?

105
00:09:51,708 --> 00:09:54,124
We don't have time to
play hide-and-seek now.

106
00:09:57,791 --> 00:09:58,791
Josh!

107
00:10:13,583 --> 00:10:17,000
Josh, this isn't
funny. It's our turn.

108
00:10:18,083 --> 00:10:19,083
Joshua!

109
00:11:01,166 --> 00:11:02,708
Josh?

110
00:11:06,125 --> 00:11:06,999
Josh!

111
00:11:22,041 --> 00:11:23,332
<i>Deutsch</i>?

112
00:11:23,333 --> 00:11:25,457
- English?
- English. English.

113
00:11:25,458 --> 00:11:27,790
- What's the problem?
- I...

114
00:11:27,791 --> 00:11:30,665
I can't find my boy. I left
him in the playroom there.

115
00:11:30,666 --> 00:11:32,790
Could be that he's just
playing hide and seek.

116
00:11:32,791 --> 00:11:36,082
- Can we please just open these doors?
- Would you please stay here?

117
00:11:36,083 --> 00:11:38,457
Most likely he went to
the hall or the bathroom.

118
00:11:38,458 --> 00:11:41,874
No, he didn't. Can we
please just open the doors?

119
00:11:41,875 --> 00:11:43,749
- Why did you leave your boy by himself?
- I...

120
00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:46,374
It was just a few seconds. He
was right here in the playroom...

121
00:11:46,375 --> 00:11:49,165
For one, I'm not authorized
to open this door.

122
00:11:49,166 --> 00:11:51,290
And for two, and
this is important,

123
00:11:51,291 --> 00:11:54,000
the Americans don't mess
around with stuff like this.

124
00:11:54,708 --> 00:11:56,583
So please come with me a moment.

125
00:11:57,166 --> 00:11:59,583
I... I want to speak to
someone who can help me.

126
00:12:06,916 --> 00:12:08,457
What seems
to be the problem?

127
00:12:08,458 --> 00:12:11,332
Mr. Kynch, I'm sorry. She,
um, caused a disturbance.

128
00:12:11,333 --> 00:12:13,415
Okay, I'll handle it.
Thank you very much.

129
00:12:13,416 --> 00:12:15,915
Eric Kynch, Regional
Security Officer.

130
00:12:15,916 --> 00:12:17,124
Sara Wulf.

131
00:12:17,125 --> 00:12:19,500
- Gunnery Sergeant Donovan.
- Ma'am.

132
00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:22,540
- You've lost your son, right?
- Yeah.

133
00:12:22,541 --> 00:12:25,416
- What's his name?
- Josh. He's six years old.

134
00:12:26,708 --> 00:12:28,541
- In these offices? Here?
- Yeah.

135
00:12:39,708 --> 00:12:40,875
Please look around.

136
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,041
Josh?

137
00:12:47,166 --> 00:12:50,750
You don't need to worry, Ms.
Wulf. If any place is safe, it's here.

138
00:12:51,625 --> 00:12:54,905
- How long was your boy at the playroom?
- I don't know. Maybe five minutes?

139
00:12:55,875 --> 00:12:58,291
We'd been here for so
long, he was super fidgety.

140
00:13:00,833 --> 00:13:02,708
Shit, how
could I just walk away?

141
00:13:04,583 --> 00:13:06,833
I have a daughter, Aileen.

142
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:08,500
She's eight.

143
00:13:09,250 --> 00:13:12,374
Of course... sometimes you
just need five minutes.

144
00:13:12,375 --> 00:13:13,999
You can't blame yourself here.

145
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,583
We'll find your son, miss.

146
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:17,500
Thank you.

147
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:22,832
<i>A child
is missing. Six years old.</i>

148
00:13:22,833 --> 00:13:26,958
<i>His name is Josh. Please
report to the information desk.</i>

149
00:13:31,791 --> 00:13:33,666
<i>A child is missing.</i>

150
00:13:39,250 --> 00:13:41,874
I've got no other ideas
where he could've gone to.

151
00:13:41,875 --> 00:13:43,915
Well, did he
somehow get outside?

152
00:13:43,916 --> 00:13:46,290
No, this place doesn't
have a second exit.

153
00:13:46,291 --> 00:13:49,790
If he'd've somehow made it to the front
desk, we'd have heard about it by now.

154
00:13:49,791 --> 00:13:51,041
I'll check anyway.

155
00:13:52,541 --> 00:13:53,541
I...

156
00:13:54,416 --> 00:13:55,708
I may have an idea.

157
00:14:00,875 --> 00:14:03,957
A man and a woman were here,
and they exchanged a bag.

158
00:14:03,958 --> 00:14:05,124
I'm aware how this sounds,

159
00:14:05,125 --> 00:14:07,707
but she went through this door,
and the man gave me a weird look.

160
00:14:07,708 --> 00:14:09,916
They both looked like they
had something to hide.

161
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:12,583
What if those two took
Josh into this wing?

162
00:14:14,083 --> 00:14:15,790
Please, can you
just open this door?

163
00:14:15,791 --> 00:14:18,332
Can't do that.
High-security area.

164
00:14:18,333 --> 00:14:21,540
What if those two people are
somehow involved? You've got a kid.

165
00:14:21,541 --> 00:14:24,101
You know what can happen to children.

166
00:14:32,791 --> 00:14:36,540
- What's going on?
- Can we speak somewhere? Privately?

167
00:14:36,541 --> 00:14:37,541
Yeah.

168
00:14:49,250 --> 00:14:52,416
Special Forces
training. Combat experience.

169
00:14:54,666 --> 00:14:55,916
So you're a veteran.

170
00:14:57,375 --> 00:14:59,000
Thank you for your service.

171
00:15:01,166 --> 00:15:04,000
- When were you in Afghanistan?
- Up through 2017.

172
00:15:04,875 --> 00:15:07,208
Could you maybe just tell
me what happened to Josh?

173
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:13,915
You applied for a visa
for you and your son.

174
00:15:13,916 --> 00:15:16,125
But only you checked
in this morning.

175
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,165
What?

176
00:15:18,166 --> 00:15:20,832
Are you serious? Of
course we both checked in.

177
00:15:20,833 --> 00:15:22,500
That's not what it says on here.

178
00:15:26,666 --> 00:15:29,749
The list is wrong. We both
checked in here this morning.

179
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:32,790
Someone did see him, people spoke
to him, like the guy at the front.

180
00:15:32,791 --> 00:15:35,625
I spoke to the service
manager. Nobody saw him.

181
00:15:36,208 --> 00:15:37,999
You were at the security
check. You saw him!

182
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,833
I didn't see a child, ma'am.

183
00:15:41,250 --> 00:15:43,332
Really? You mean to tell
me he wasn't here with me?

184
00:15:43,333 --> 00:15:45,291
That is how it looks, Ms. Wulf.

185
00:15:46,541 --> 00:15:50,499
Okay, there are cameras everywhere.
Wh... What about surveillance videos?

186
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:53,457
I checked them already. Only
you can be seen in the footage.

187
00:15:53,458 --> 00:15:55,707
That's not true. So let me
take a look at these videos.

188
00:15:55,708 --> 00:15:57,582
Are you calling
me a liar, ma'am?

189
00:15:57,583 --> 00:15:59,458
Sergeant. Please.

190
00:16:05,458 --> 00:16:06,458
Okay.

191
00:16:07,041 --> 00:16:09,290
So this is pointless, I want
to speak to the German police.

192
00:16:09,291 --> 00:16:12,541
Sure, yeah. They were
informed already.

193
00:16:19,666 --> 00:16:23,208
Hello. This is Eric Kynch. Ms.
Wulf would like to have a word.

194
00:16:25,958 --> 00:16:27,499
- <i>Schirmer.</i>
- Okay.

195
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:29,082
They want me to think
it's in my head,

196
00:16:29,083 --> 00:16:31,624
but I came here with my
baby boy early this morning.

197
00:16:31,625 --> 00:16:33,999
They want me to believe
he was never here.

198
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,458
Could you please come here?

199
00:16:36,291 --> 00:16:39,874
<i>Ms. Wulf, we've been
informed about the situation at hand.</i>

200
00:16:39,875 --> 00:16:42,832
<i>But we're not authorized to
enter the consulate building.</i>

201
00:16:42,833 --> 00:16:43,874
Which means what?

202
00:16:43,875 --> 00:16:46,832
<i>The consulate's
considered an exterritorial area.</i>

203
00:16:46,833 --> 00:16:49,082
Yeah, I know that. But,
so, w... what then?

204
00:16:49,083 --> 00:16:51,499
<i>The German authorities
have no jurisdiction there.</i>

205
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:54,208
<i>Basically, it's the same
as American territory.</i>

206
00:16:54,791 --> 00:16:57,249
<i>Come out for now. We've always
collaborated very well...</i>

207
00:16:57,250 --> 00:17:00,249
But if I do go out, they
won't let me come back in!

208
00:17:00,250 --> 00:17:02,957
And I won't be allowed
to see my son again!

209
00:17:02,958 --> 00:17:05,499
<i>Ms. Wulf,
you have to calm down.</i>

210
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:08,208
<i>Two of my colleagues will meet you
at the entrance in ten minutes.</i>

211
00:17:11,250 --> 00:17:15,124
Ms. Wulf, I promise that we'll
continue to cooperate with you.

212
00:17:15,125 --> 00:17:16,165
Hey!

213
00:17:22,291 --> 00:17:24,957
- Ms. Wulf, calm down, please.
- I won't go without my son!

214
00:17:24,958 --> 00:17:27,874
I've got no idea about what happened
to your son. But he wasn't here!

215
00:17:28,875 --> 00:17:31,541
Ms. Wulf, please! Please!

216
00:17:32,833 --> 00:17:33,833
Okay?

217
00:17:34,583 --> 00:17:36,082
Okay.

218
00:17:39,208 --> 00:17:40,416
It's okay.

219
00:17:41,250 --> 00:17:43,749
You're under a lot of
stress. I get that. I do.

220
00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:45,749
But I'm asking you,
please stay in this room

221
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:47,665
until the German
police pick you up.

222
00:17:47,666 --> 00:17:49,833
The sergeant here
will keep you company.

223
00:17:51,541 --> 00:17:53,021
Have a good rest of
your day with us.

224
00:17:59,291 --> 00:18:00,666
Please sit down, ma'am.

225
00:18:26,916 --> 00:18:27,958
Copy.

226
00:18:28,791 --> 00:18:31,041
Stay here. Don't move.

227
00:18:52,041 --> 00:18:54,665
- <i>Hello?</i>
- Hi. It's me, Mom. Hi.

228
00:18:54,666 --> 00:18:57,499
<i>- Sara?</i>
- I'm at the US Consulate in Frankfurt.

229
00:18:57,500 --> 00:18:59,707
- You have to help me. Josh is missing.
<i>- What?</i>

230
00:18:59,708 --> 00:19:02,249
You've gotta make contact
with the press and police.

231
00:19:02,250 --> 00:19:05,041
They kidnapped Josh. Now
they're covering their tracks.

232
00:19:09,250 --> 00:19:10,250
Are you there?

233
00:19:11,166 --> 00:19:13,249
<i>Sara, you're taking
your pills, right?</i>

234
00:19:13,250 --> 00:19:16,165
Mom, please. What's
one gotta do with the other?

235
00:19:16,166 --> 00:19:18,666
I'm fine. You know I'm fine.
Why would you say that?

236
00:19:19,375 --> 00:19:22,207
<i>Can you put someone from the
consulate on the phone, please?</i>

237
00:19:22,208 --> 00:19:24,499
I already told
you, Mom. It's...

238
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:28,249
<i>Listen. I know it is hard for
you, but you have to calm down.</i>

239
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:31,290
<i>Please tell me what
happened. Where's Josh? Sara!</i>

240
00:20:27,958 --> 00:20:30,749
Oh my God, the level 10 is so
hard, it's impossible to beat.

241
00:20:30,750 --> 00:20:33,583
I had two hours to beat it,
and I still couldn't beat it.

242
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:53,250
Sergeant.

243
00:20:54,250 --> 00:20:55,375
Please take your break now.

244
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,250
I'll take the next shift.

245
00:21:37,625 --> 00:21:38,874
Any issues?

246
00:21:38,875 --> 00:21:40,458
No. We're all good.

247
00:21:41,416 --> 00:21:42,416
Good.

248
00:23:43,416 --> 00:23:44,416
Josh?

249
00:25:09,791 --> 00:25:11,290
Help!

250
00:25:13,416 --> 00:25:14,665
Be quiet.

251
00:25:23,750 --> 00:25:24,750
Okay.

252
00:25:28,875 --> 00:25:29,875
English, <i>Deutsch</i>?

253
00:25:31,333 --> 00:25:32,249
English, <i>Deutsch</i>?

254
00:25:32,250 --> 00:25:34,291
English. English.

255
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,125
Sit there.

256
00:25:40,958 --> 00:25:44,582
Did you see a boy here?
About this tall, black hair.

257
00:25:44,583 --> 00:25:45,791
What?

258
00:25:46,916 --> 00:25:48,665
Jewelry in a plastic bag?

259
00:25:48,666 --> 00:25:50,957
Who are you? How
come you're here?

260
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,000
Miss?

261
00:25:58,250 --> 00:25:59,290
Miss!

262
00:25:59,291 --> 00:26:01,791
I'm not here. I'm not here.

263
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:05,875
The things you requested.

264
00:26:07,416 --> 00:26:09,125
Are you all right?

265
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,082
No.

266
00:26:14,375 --> 00:26:16,000
No fresh fruit again?

267
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:18,916
Honey, I can't
live on that junk.

268
00:26:19,833 --> 00:26:21,791
I'll talk to
the guest supervisor.

269
00:26:26,625 --> 00:26:27,625
Thank you.

270
00:26:33,083 --> 00:26:34,833
What's this about a
boy you're looking for?

271
00:26:35,958 --> 00:26:38,124
My son went missing
two hours ago.

272
00:26:38,125 --> 00:26:41,500
And I believe he was taken. From
the play room in the visitor area.

273
00:26:42,250 --> 00:26:43,915
So go speak to, like, security.

274
00:26:43,916 --> 00:26:46,791
I think someone here from the
consulate has something to do with it.

275
00:26:48,416 --> 00:26:50,041
Have you seen a little boy here?

276
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:52,541
No.

277
00:26:54,500 --> 00:26:55,958
I wasn't here either.

278
00:26:57,291 --> 00:26:59,500
How did you make it here
from the visitor area?

279
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:04,166
There are cameras, security doors,
security personnel everywhere here.

280
00:27:06,916 --> 00:27:08,290
I'm trained for
this kind of thing.

281
00:27:08,291 --> 00:27:10,833
So what are you? A
freakin' special agent?

282
00:27:11,458 --> 00:27:12,999
I was a soldier

283
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,041
Hm.

284
00:27:15,625 --> 00:27:17,416
- Take care.
- I can help you.

285
00:27:18,916 --> 00:27:21,041
I'm someone who knows
their way around.

286
00:27:21,625 --> 00:27:23,000
I've been here for
months already.

287
00:27:24,083 --> 00:27:27,541
You need to stay here. I can help
out. Maybe even find your son.

288
00:27:28,708 --> 00:27:31,041
If you help find me a
way out of this place.

289
00:27:36,333 --> 00:27:39,291
I remember that. A
skirmish in a hospital, right?

290
00:27:39,958 --> 00:27:44,249
Yeah. An American and German
recon team ran into an ambush.

291
00:27:44,250 --> 00:27:45,332
Eight killed.

292
00:27:45,333 --> 00:27:48,916
Sara Wulf was the only survivor and
was heavily wounded by shrapnel.

293
00:27:50,125 --> 00:27:53,999
Trained in hand-to-hand
combat. Is she special forces?

294
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:58,040
Retired. She was in a Bundeswehr
unit called "Fernspäher."

295
00:27:58,041 --> 00:28:01,625
Reconnaissance. Trained in stealth,
infiltration and extraction.

296
00:28:04,291 --> 00:28:05,666
I think she's harmless.

297
00:28:06,458 --> 00:28:09,332
Delusional perhaps,
but harmless.

298
00:28:09,333 --> 00:28:13,290
Still, we can't let a special forces
soldier roam free on our premises.

299
00:28:14,666 --> 00:28:17,457
Ms. Consul General, we...
we raise an official alarm,

300
00:28:17,458 --> 00:28:21,125
she'll be reported, put in jail, she'll
get a criminal record, won't get a job.

301
00:28:21,708 --> 00:28:24,625
It ain't easy to get back on your
feet after what she's been through.

302
00:28:25,333 --> 00:28:26,875
She's just a scared mother.

303
00:28:28,875 --> 00:28:31,083
Find her. But keep it quiet.

304
00:28:31,875 --> 00:28:32,916
Yes, ma'am.

305
00:28:40,916 --> 00:28:42,790
- Yes, sir.
<i>- Where is she?</i>

306
00:28:42,791 --> 00:28:45,166
I'm sorry. I don't
have her on the monitors.

307
00:28:48,291 --> 00:28:49,291
I'm Sara, by the way.

308
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,000
Irina.

309
00:28:55,750 --> 00:28:56,915
Please, don't.

310
00:28:56,916 --> 00:28:59,458
I'm always playing it
this loud, no one'll hear.

311
00:29:02,250 --> 00:29:03,665
Can you access
the Internet here?

312
00:29:03,666 --> 00:29:06,124
No. They took my SIM
card away from me.

313
00:29:06,125 --> 00:29:07,790
There's some
ultra-lame intranet,

314
00:29:07,791 --> 00:29:11,374
and the Wi-Fi's triple
secured, WPA3, no SSID.

315
00:29:11,375 --> 00:29:13,416
I majored in computer science.

316
00:29:15,833 --> 00:29:17,250
But you're a political refugee?

317
00:29:18,875 --> 00:29:19,916
Of a sort, yeah.

318
00:29:20,833 --> 00:29:23,124
You must be under protection,
why do you need my help?

319
00:29:23,125 --> 00:29:24,540
You're not a prisoner.

320
00:29:24,541 --> 00:29:26,665
I am, though. I'm not allowed
to leave the consulate.

321
00:29:26,666 --> 00:29:28,416
What prompted you to attack me?

322
00:29:28,916 --> 00:29:31,250
You ask a lot of
questions. So...

323
00:29:33,458 --> 00:29:34,666
Have we got a deal?

324
00:29:35,416 --> 00:29:36,666
Yeah, okay. Deal.

325
00:29:37,875 --> 00:29:40,708
No, it's fine. Just
get me out of here.

326
00:29:46,125 --> 00:29:47,290
What else is in this building?

327
00:29:47,291 --> 00:29:51,082
Storage rooms, guest apartments.
But no one's here, I'd have seen.

328
00:29:51,083 --> 00:29:52,540
And in the other buildings?

329
00:29:52,541 --> 00:29:55,540
I'm at the gym once in a
while and the cafeteria.

330
00:29:55,541 --> 00:29:58,500
But only with an escort.
You need a key card to go anywhere.

331
00:30:00,125 --> 00:30:05,040
I've also walked by some...
offices and training rooms too.

332
00:30:05,041 --> 00:30:07,290
There's a daycare for the
kids of the employees.

333
00:30:07,291 --> 00:30:10,582
And there's a tunnel to the
warehouse. A massive storage space.

334
00:30:10,583 --> 00:30:12,999
Tons of stuff is sent to other
American embassies from there.

335
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,832
Then we'll
go to the warehouse.

336
00:30:17,166 --> 00:30:19,000
- What are you looking at?
- Nothing.

337
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:21,708
Let's go.

338
00:30:23,041 --> 00:30:24,540
Why go to the warehouse?

339
00:30:24,541 --> 00:30:27,708
Well, it's the only way to smuggle
somebody out of this place.

340
00:30:28,208 --> 00:30:29,957
I hope they didn't
already move Josh.

341
00:30:29,958 --> 00:30:31,040
Who's they?

342
00:30:31,041 --> 00:30:33,000
The two I saw who
exchanged a bag.

343
00:30:33,583 --> 00:30:35,540
The woman went into
this building here.

344
00:30:35,541 --> 00:30:38,165
And I bet my boy's disappearance
is connected to her.

345
00:30:38,166 --> 00:30:41,500
Son kidnapped in the
consulate. Secret exchanges.

346
00:30:42,166 --> 00:30:44,415
Makes total sense. For real.

347
00:30:46,333 --> 00:30:49,541
- Just show me the way.
- I told you we need a key card.

348
00:30:54,291 --> 00:30:55,708
Okay, copy that.

349
00:31:10,750 --> 00:31:13,749
- Fuck. Did you kill him?
- Of course not. Just help me.

350
00:31:13,750 --> 00:31:16,207
Hurry. Help me!

351
00:31:16,208 --> 00:31:18,583
He'll wake up soon. His foot.

352
00:31:19,291 --> 00:31:20,291
Okay, okay.

353
00:31:25,833 --> 00:31:26,833
This way.

354
00:31:27,375 --> 00:31:29,957
You're like a
badass fighting machine.

355
00:31:29,958 --> 00:31:31,458
Make sure it's clear.

356
00:31:42,041 --> 00:31:43,375
It's too simple.

357
00:31:44,875 --> 00:31:47,665
They should be going
wild now. Close the door.

358
00:31:47,666 --> 00:31:49,458
Search parties, exits blocked.

359
00:31:50,250 --> 00:31:52,249
They should've seen
us on the monitors

360
00:31:52,250 --> 00:31:54,041
and that the
camera's been broken.

361
00:31:54,541 --> 00:31:55,875
There's something wrong.

362
00:32:04,041 --> 00:32:05,832
Are you sure this is the
way to the warehouse?

363
00:32:05,833 --> 00:32:07,125
Absolutely.

364
00:32:13,625 --> 00:32:15,125
Someone's coming. Quick!

365
00:32:45,083 --> 00:32:47,083
What is it?

366
00:32:48,833 --> 00:32:49,958
Nothing.

367
00:32:52,708 --> 00:32:55,916
If you've got issues or
whatever, just tell me now, okay?

368
00:33:00,833 --> 00:33:01,916
Okay.

369
00:33:17,250 --> 00:33:19,249
You think
there's a kid in here?

370
00:33:19,250 --> 00:33:21,541
Sara, seriously, why would
anyone kidnap your son?

371
00:33:27,125 --> 00:33:29,624
You're not gonna be able to
search the entire consulate.

372
00:33:29,625 --> 00:33:31,540
Do you know how huge it is?

373
00:33:31,541 --> 00:33:32,541
Hello?

374
00:33:33,375 --> 00:33:34,916
Come on, please.

375
00:33:37,791 --> 00:33:39,874
The last truck left
shorty after one o'clock.

376
00:33:39,875 --> 00:33:41,665
Josh went missing around 2 p.m.

377
00:33:41,666 --> 00:33:43,624
They can't have
moved him out yet.

378
00:33:43,625 --> 00:33:45,457
The next one leaves in an hour.

379
00:33:45,458 --> 00:33:46,958
Okay, I'll post up here.

380
00:33:47,583 --> 00:33:48,625
And what about me?

381
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:51,500
We'll smuggle you out
on the next truck.

382
00:33:53,666 --> 00:33:54,666
What is it?

383
00:34:01,458 --> 00:34:02,458
Wait a minute.

384
00:34:10,958 --> 00:34:13,207
What's the matter with
you? You can't just...

385
00:34:14,125 --> 00:34:15,125
Wow.

386
00:34:17,541 --> 00:34:18,541
Oh, yeah.

387
00:34:21,333 --> 00:34:23,625
So this is what it's
all about. Drugs.

388
00:34:25,916 --> 00:34:27,082
We've gotta move.

389
00:34:27,083 --> 00:34:29,790
No. No! I'm staying put, man.

390
00:34:29,791 --> 00:34:32,458
- I'm getting out of here.
- We're changing course.

391
00:34:33,125 --> 00:34:35,625
- You promised me. We made a deal!
- Sh!

392
00:34:55,666 --> 00:34:58,040
Diplomatic luggage
doesn't go through customs.

393
00:34:58,041 --> 00:34:59,540
That can't be a coincidence.

394
00:34:59,541 --> 00:35:01,290
The drugs, the exchange.

395
00:35:01,291 --> 00:35:03,374
Josh must have seen something.

396
00:35:03,375 --> 00:35:06,335
- I gotta talk to head of security.
- How am I supposed to get out of here?

397
00:35:07,333 --> 00:35:08,415
There's no way anymore.

398
00:35:08,416 --> 00:35:09,707
The fuck?

399
00:35:09,708 --> 00:35:12,290
They need to clear this up, it'll
be chaos here if you leave now.

400
00:35:12,291 --> 00:35:13,249
- But...
- It's my boy.

401
00:35:13,250 --> 00:35:16,011
- I've gotta find him, I'm sorry!
- Come on this story makes no sense!

402
00:35:17,333 --> 00:35:19,125
Maybe he wasn't really here.

403
00:35:23,291 --> 00:35:24,916
This is his Playmobile figurine.

404
00:35:25,750 --> 00:35:26,750
He was here.

405
00:35:28,250 --> 00:35:29,650
And you feel that
proves something?

406
00:35:30,333 --> 00:35:31,333
I do.

407
00:35:33,333 --> 00:35:34,333
He was here.

408
00:35:35,166 --> 00:35:36,458
Sorry, Sara.

409
00:35:37,875 --> 00:35:39,833
But right now you
seem like a psycho.

410
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:42,832
Good luck.

411
00:35:42,833 --> 00:35:45,040
- You're getting me out of here!
- I have to find my son!

412
00:35:45,041 --> 00:35:47,165
No, this is bullshit!
Your son is not...

413
00:35:47,166 --> 00:35:50,541
- Fucking don't touch me. Your son isn't...
- I've seen it, and I know it.

414
00:35:51,708 --> 00:35:54,124
Not so fast. Who are you?

415
00:35:54,125 --> 00:35:56,541
A rich girl being
persecuted? I don't buy it.

416
00:36:00,083 --> 00:36:01,458
You're being a psycho.

417
00:36:06,625 --> 00:36:08,665
Who is it?

418
00:36:08,666 --> 00:36:09,665
I'm coming.

419
00:36:11,583 --> 00:36:13,957
What are you doing? Stop! Stop!

420
00:36:16,166 --> 00:36:17,082
Sara!

421
00:36:34,916 --> 00:36:36,332
Sara!

422
00:36:36,333 --> 00:36:37,958
Sara!

423
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,166
Sara! Help me!

424
00:37:02,708 --> 00:37:05,040
Sara! Sara, help me!

425
00:37:49,041 --> 00:37:50,915
Sara, watch out!

426
00:38:21,708 --> 00:38:23,375
They wanted me dead, man!

427
00:38:24,916 --> 00:38:26,375
If so, they'd've done it.

428
00:38:27,333 --> 00:38:28,958
They were kidnapping you.

429
00:38:31,958 --> 00:38:35,625
Irina, who were those men?
What's the thumb drive holding?

430
00:38:36,583 --> 00:38:38,125
I have to
get out of here.

431
00:38:44,583 --> 00:38:47,165
There are two injured men in
there. They tried to kidnap Iri...

432
00:38:56,041 --> 00:38:57,125
I really am sorry.

433
00:38:59,250 --> 00:39:00,250
Sorry.

434
00:39:01,791 --> 00:39:03,457
I'll
clear the apartment.

435
00:40:41,375 --> 00:40:42,583
Ms. Wulf.

436
00:40:44,833 --> 00:40:47,290
I'm General Consul
Deborah Allen.

437
00:40:47,291 --> 00:40:48,375
Are you all right?

438
00:40:49,125 --> 00:40:51,291
My son was here today
with me, he's missing now.

439
00:40:52,166 --> 00:40:54,415
They're claiming my
son was never here.

440
00:40:54,416 --> 00:40:55,707
I found a bag of drugs.

441
00:40:55,708 --> 00:40:56,999
Two men attempted to make off

442
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,333
with the woman in the
apartment for guests. Irina.

443
00:41:00,291 --> 00:41:01,958
The thing with Josh must be...

444
00:41:04,833 --> 00:41:05,833
What is it?

445
00:41:06,500 --> 00:41:08,332
Your mother called us
this afternoon, Ms. Wulf.

446
00:41:08,333 --> 00:41:10,999
- She's very worried about you.
- My mother?

447
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,874
She says that you have
post-traumatic stress disorder

448
00:41:13,875 --> 00:41:16,125
with psychotic episodes
and even delusions.

449
00:41:17,458 --> 00:41:19,790
You've received
inpatient treatment.

450
00:41:19,791 --> 00:41:22,624
The cause was probably
your injury in Afghanistan.

451
00:41:22,625 --> 00:41:25,582
Your son's father was
killed there too, wasn't he?

452
00:41:25,583 --> 00:41:28,000
What's happening here
isn't related to my issues.

453
00:41:28,500 --> 00:41:30,415
Please, time is of the essence.

454
00:41:30,416 --> 00:41:32,540
We've gotta find my son
fast. Please let me go.

455
00:41:32,541 --> 00:41:34,790
Ms. Wulf, you were
in our custody,

456
00:41:34,791 --> 00:41:36,624
and you managed to break out.

457
00:41:36,625 --> 00:41:38,832
Then you beat up an armed
guard in the hallway.

458
00:41:38,833 --> 00:41:41,707
And as for these supposed
kidnappers, there's no evidence.

459
00:41:41,708 --> 00:41:42,999
Nobody has seen them.

460
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,665
- Sure, but Irina can prove that she...
- I'm sorry, but...

461
00:41:45,666 --> 00:41:48,415
now we only have a single
occupied apartment,

462
00:41:48,416 --> 00:41:51,082
and the woman who is living
there is not named Irina.

463
00:41:52,500 --> 00:41:53,540
What?

464
00:41:53,541 --> 00:41:55,624
Sergeant Donovan
talked to our guest.

465
00:41:55,625 --> 00:41:59,332
This person wasn't aware of an attempted
kidnapping, and she doesn't know you.

466
00:41:59,333 --> 00:42:02,208
That isn't right.
Donovan is lying.

467
00:42:03,500 --> 00:42:06,500
There are cameras and videos.
I wanna see the videos.

468
00:43:05,125 --> 00:43:07,083
We've spoken
to a psychologist.

469
00:43:07,833 --> 00:43:09,915
Sometimes our brain
plays tricks on us

470
00:43:09,916 --> 00:43:13,375
when it doesn't process
traumatic experiences thoroughly.

471
00:43:15,291 --> 00:43:19,041
Your mother said that you had a prior
incident where you attacked someone?

472
00:43:20,041 --> 00:43:21,541
A long time ago, yeah.

473
00:43:22,208 --> 00:43:23,790
I received pills. I
was given treatment.

474
00:43:23,791 --> 00:43:24,874
I'm doing all right.

475
00:43:24,875 --> 00:43:27,624
I don't wanna discuss whose
fault it is, Ms. Wulf,

476
00:43:27,625 --> 00:43:30,832
all I want to do is to
get you the help you need.

477
00:43:30,833 --> 00:43:31,875
Try to remember.

478
00:43:32,916 --> 00:43:34,707
Maybe something
happened to Josh?

479
00:43:34,708 --> 00:43:35,708
No.

480
00:43:36,541 --> 00:43:39,165
Maybe there was some
incident, and you're suppressing it?

481
00:43:39,166 --> 00:43:41,791
- No.
- Or did you lose him somewhere earlier?

482
00:43:43,250 --> 00:43:46,208
Josh?

483
00:43:47,791 --> 00:43:50,290
No. No. I came
here with him this morning.

484
00:43:50,291 --> 00:43:52,249
I kept him in my sight
all day, he was with me.

485
00:43:52,250 --> 00:43:54,125
For real. I'm not
imagining this.

486
00:43:54,750 --> 00:43:56,999
You've been given a sedative
that may still be in effect.

487
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:59,457
I'm not imagining
this. Please let me go!

488
00:43:59,458 --> 00:44:01,540
Tomorrow morning, German
authorities will pick you up

489
00:44:01,541 --> 00:44:04,874
and take you to a hospital, where
everything else will be resolved.

490
00:44:04,875 --> 00:44:08,040
Please let me go, let me go!
I'm not imagining anything!

491
00:44:08,041 --> 00:44:11,290
I came here today with Josh. I did. Josh!
He was here, I didn't just imagine it.

492
00:44:11,291 --> 00:44:13,290
See that a nurse
checks on her later on.

493
00:44:13,291 --> 00:44:14,207
Yes, ma'am.

494
00:44:15,333 --> 00:44:16,540
Josh.

495
00:44:56,041 --> 00:44:57,416
It's a cover-up here.

496
00:44:58,291 --> 00:44:59,582
What?

497
00:44:59,583 --> 00:45:03,915
The assistant to the security
chief, Donovan, interrogated me.

498
00:45:03,916 --> 00:45:05,791
I didn't tell him
we found drugs.

499
00:45:06,291 --> 00:45:09,250
Your kidnappers and all that,
he didn't wanna hear it.

500
00:45:10,583 --> 00:45:12,541
He walked back to the
apartment with me.

501
00:45:13,291 --> 00:45:15,083
It was all put back.

502
00:45:15,750 --> 00:45:17,000
Everything in place.

503
00:45:19,208 --> 00:45:21,208
They didn't find
this though, luckily.

504
00:45:23,666 --> 00:45:24,875
Your mind is fine.

505
00:45:26,166 --> 00:45:27,625
Something's amiss here.

506
00:45:30,500 --> 00:45:31,500
So come on.

507
00:45:34,625 --> 00:45:37,875
- How do I know if you're real?
- Come on, of course I'm real.

508
00:45:39,041 --> 00:45:41,750
They said I imagined you. They
said they never heard of you.

509
00:45:48,125 --> 00:45:49,625
I wasn't sure if
I could trust you.

510
00:45:51,416 --> 00:45:53,166
Irina isn't my real name.

511
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:55,416
It's Kira Wolkowa.

512
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:59,874
We were one of the richest
families in Belarus.

513
00:45:59,875 --> 00:46:01,541
My father was a criminal.

514
00:46:05,125 --> 00:46:06,375
Just money laundering,

515
00:46:07,250 --> 00:46:08,957
but still, he was a criminal.

516
00:46:08,958 --> 00:46:11,166
Like almost everyone
else in the government.

517
00:46:11,750 --> 00:46:15,250
Then my father switched parties, which
obviously terrified the authorities.

518
00:46:21,208 --> 00:46:22,624
So they snuffed him out.

519
00:46:24,083 --> 00:46:26,874
And if I hadn't made it to
the US embassy in Minsk,

520
00:46:26,875 --> 00:46:29,125
I would've been the
next one they killed.

521
00:46:32,333 --> 00:46:34,666
This thumb drive is where
the evidence is stored.

522
00:46:35,833 --> 00:46:37,665
And those people want it back.

523
00:46:37,666 --> 00:46:39,125
But why Frankfurt?

524
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:41,875
The CIA got me out
of the embassy.

525
00:46:43,833 --> 00:46:46,415
And I should've gone
straight to the US, but...

526
00:46:46,416 --> 00:46:47,750
it didn't happen.

527
00:46:49,083 --> 00:46:50,208
I'm stuck here.

528
00:46:50,833 --> 00:46:53,416
For month after month,
it's excuse after excuse.

529
00:46:54,333 --> 00:46:56,915
Two days ago, Donovan came and
asked me to hand over my passport,

530
00:46:56,916 --> 00:46:58,833
and that's when I knew
something wasn't right.

531
00:46:59,416 --> 00:47:02,166
Someone let these
men into the embassy.

532
00:47:02,708 --> 00:47:04,082
I'm who they wanted.

533
00:47:04,083 --> 00:47:06,333
But they showed me the
surveillance videos and...

534
00:47:07,083 --> 00:47:09,332
I was by myself,
speaking to no one.

535
00:47:09,333 --> 00:47:11,708
You don't believe
I'm real? Okay.

536
00:47:20,416 --> 00:47:22,776
- Then this isn't real, right?
- What's the matter with you?

537
00:47:23,583 --> 00:47:25,290
It's nothing. It's
not real, right?

538
00:47:26,750 --> 00:47:27,832
Come on, stop it.

539
00:47:31,458 --> 00:47:32,458
Welcome back.

540
00:47:45,291 --> 00:47:48,458
Window. There are cameras
everywhere in the hallways.

541
00:47:50,916 --> 00:47:52,749
Are you sure
that it's safer outside?

542
00:47:52,750 --> 00:47:53,999
No.

543
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:55,833
- Great.
- Come on now.

544
00:48:06,750 --> 00:48:08,290
I don't know
what's going on here

545
00:48:08,291 --> 00:48:11,874
or how the drugs and the kidnappers
are connected to Josh, but...

546
00:48:11,875 --> 00:48:13,832
I bet Donovan's a part of this.

547
00:48:13,833 --> 00:48:15,375
Yeah, but how do
we find that guy?

548
00:48:15,875 --> 00:48:19,291
We've gotta find who owns the
bag. The only lead we've got.

549
00:48:19,833 --> 00:48:20,832
Can you...

550
00:48:34,833 --> 00:48:38,624
<i>The Bilateral Economics
Conference will resume in five minutes.</i>

551
00:48:38,625 --> 00:48:41,500
<i>Participants, please
come to Auditorium 1.</i>

552
00:49:18,875 --> 00:49:19,875
Security.

553
00:49:38,583 --> 00:49:39,875
Great plan, Sara.

554
00:49:57,791 --> 00:49:59,000
Fuck.

555
00:50:00,791 --> 00:50:06,208
The title of this next slide,
"Connecting Businesses to Global Markets."

556
00:50:06,791 --> 00:50:08,458
It isn't just a statement.

557
00:50:09,583 --> 00:50:10,583
It's a commitment.

558
00:50:14,583 --> 00:50:15,874
DM.

559
00:50:15,875 --> 00:50:19,000
I posted to the consulate's intranet.
Hopefully they'll get back to us soon.

560
00:50:25,500 --> 00:50:26,750
Hey, what's the matter?

561
00:50:28,708 --> 00:50:30,250
What if they're
right, and I'm wrong?

562
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:32,083
Don't be silly.

563
00:50:33,958 --> 00:50:36,333
I thought I had it
under control with the pills.

564
00:50:37,041 --> 00:50:38,958
But I've got flashbacks again.

565
00:50:40,750 --> 00:50:42,666
All those images
are coming back.

566
00:50:43,958 --> 00:50:45,125
Gaslighting.

567
00:50:46,125 --> 00:50:48,458
My ex did it to me.

568
00:50:49,041 --> 00:50:50,832
He kept me in his
grip from day one.

569
00:50:50,833 --> 00:50:54,582
And he... convinced me of
things that weren't true.

570
00:50:54,583 --> 00:50:58,708
Till I couldn't be positive
what was real... or fake.

571
00:51:02,125 --> 00:51:04,125
I mean, I know it's
not the same, but...

572
00:51:08,291 --> 00:51:10,083
Here, just snap this
against your wrist.

573
00:51:11,208 --> 00:51:13,541
It helped me to feel it
when times got tough.

574
00:51:17,500 --> 00:51:19,041
Come on. Do it right.

575
00:51:19,958 --> 00:51:21,166
Aah!

576
00:51:29,625 --> 00:51:30,625
Thanks.

577
00:51:35,916 --> 00:51:37,750
So, what's your plan?

578
00:51:38,416 --> 00:51:39,791
When this is all over?

579
00:51:41,833 --> 00:51:45,750
Off to Boston. Opposition
members have a community there.

580
00:51:47,208 --> 00:51:49,457
Between those folks and
the evidence I've got,

581
00:51:49,458 --> 00:51:51,666
we could likely free
a few more dissidents.

582
00:51:53,291 --> 00:51:55,416
We got asylum there
for my mother.

583
00:51:56,500 --> 00:51:58,666
But it's been over a year
since we made contact.

584
00:52:01,791 --> 00:52:02,790
And you?

585
00:52:02,791 --> 00:52:05,416
What brings you to America?

586
00:52:09,083 --> 00:52:11,666
A huge security firm
gave me a job over there.

587
00:52:12,875 --> 00:52:13,875
Yeah.

588
00:52:15,083 --> 00:52:17,708
Pay's good.
Prospects are better.

589
00:52:19,833 --> 00:52:23,624
They, um... they
wanted female ex-soldiers.

590
00:52:23,625 --> 00:52:25,083
It's a... a new beginning.

591
00:52:26,208 --> 00:52:28,791
I just couldn't stand
it here anymore.

592
00:52:31,791 --> 00:52:34,791
I barely even...
have time for Josh.

593
00:52:38,250 --> 00:52:39,749
And we live with my mother.

594
00:52:39,750 --> 00:52:41,082
Ouch.

595
00:52:41,083 --> 00:52:42,375
Yeah.

596
00:52:44,375 --> 00:52:46,875
Yeah. The woman does
her best, but...

597
00:52:48,375 --> 00:52:49,916
I would also like, um...

598
00:52:51,291 --> 00:52:53,291
Josh and his family
to know each other.

599
00:52:55,958 --> 00:52:57,708
His father was American.

600
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:00,000
Was?

601
00:53:00,708 --> 00:53:01,791
Died in battle.

602
00:53:04,458 --> 00:53:05,666
In Afghanistan.

603
00:53:08,875 --> 00:53:10,041
Well, I'm sorry.

604
00:53:12,791 --> 00:53:15,833
In the hospital... I first
found out that I was...

605
00:53:16,458 --> 00:53:17,458
I was pregnant.

606
00:53:19,750 --> 00:53:21,500
Josh is my little miracle.

607
00:53:24,041 --> 00:53:25,625
Or big one.

608
00:53:28,500 --> 00:53:29,500
He replied.

609
00:53:35,500 --> 00:53:37,999
No real name. He
wants to meet immediately.

610
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:39,041
Here?

611
00:53:39,541 --> 00:53:41,625
Too dangerous. An open area.

612
00:53:42,166 --> 00:53:44,458
Yeah, but where? The
cafeteria or something?

613
00:53:45,541 --> 00:53:46,541
That'll work.

614
00:53:47,458 --> 00:53:51,332
Sara. That was sarcastic,
you can't be... Wait!

615
00:53:51,333 --> 00:53:54,833
- Where they'll least expect us.
- This is insane.

616
00:53:55,416 --> 00:53:57,750
We'd have to pass through
the whole consulate.

617
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:01,000
We're not going
through the consulate.

618
00:54:03,583 --> 00:54:04,583
Over here.

619
00:54:23,750 --> 00:54:24,750
Fuck.

620
00:54:28,166 --> 00:54:30,165
Call Donovan. I
have to pick up my daughter.

621
00:54:30,166 --> 00:54:31,540
Yes, sir.

622
00:55:01,250 --> 00:55:02,291
They're looking for you.

623
00:55:03,208 --> 00:55:04,208
Everywhere.

624
00:55:06,750 --> 00:55:07,957
Where's my son?

625
00:55:07,958 --> 00:55:10,375
Brown hair, six-ish?

626
00:55:11,458 --> 00:55:12,458
Name's Josh?

627
00:55:15,625 --> 00:55:18,166
Give me the bag, and I'll
tell you where he is.

628
00:55:23,666 --> 00:55:24,666
You don't know shit.

629
00:55:25,750 --> 00:55:27,082
You just want the bag.

630
00:55:27,083 --> 00:55:28,166
What? No.

631
00:55:28,750 --> 00:55:31,625
Yeah. I can see you're lying.

632
00:55:32,958 --> 00:55:35,958
The drugs must be worth, what?
A couple of hundred thousand?

633
00:55:37,083 --> 00:55:39,915
So, if the bag doesn't
reach its destination,

634
00:55:39,916 --> 00:55:41,041
you're gonna be in trouble.

635
00:55:42,541 --> 00:55:45,416
- What do you want?
- Help me find my son.

636
00:55:46,166 --> 00:55:47,750
I just told you
everything I know.

637
00:55:48,458 --> 00:55:50,290
To be valuable for the
people who pay you,

638
00:55:50,291 --> 00:55:52,499
you must have high
security clearance.

639
00:55:52,500 --> 00:55:55,291
What are you? CIA? NSA?

640
00:55:56,166 --> 00:55:57,457
Tech?

641
00:55:57,458 --> 00:55:58,458
Yeah.

642
00:56:02,125 --> 00:56:03,582
I need a floor plan
of the compound.

643
00:56:03,583 --> 00:56:05,999
And a key card with all access.

644
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:08,291
- That's impossible.
- Is it?

645
00:56:09,041 --> 00:56:11,000
You want the bag, you'll
think of something.

646
00:56:14,708 --> 00:56:15,708
Uh...

647
00:56:16,375 --> 00:56:19,750
Wait here. Twenty
minutes, then leave.

648
00:56:20,333 --> 00:56:21,375
Not before.

649
00:56:23,500 --> 00:56:25,416
Meet me at the men's
room down the hall.

650
00:56:44,291 --> 00:56:46,749
I need to go wee-wee.

651
00:56:46,750 --> 00:56:48,207
<i>I need
to go wee-wee.</i>

652
00:56:48,208 --> 00:56:51,000
<i>I need to go wee-wee.</i>

653
00:57:06,458 --> 00:57:08,332
You've got to be kidding me.

654
00:57:10,125 --> 00:57:13,124
Mice crispies. Mice crispies.

655
00:57:17,083 --> 00:57:17,999
Yeah?

656
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:20,582
<i>Sir, we've
got a system failure.</i>

657
00:57:20,583 --> 00:57:23,875
Okay. We gotta go,
honey. Let's go.

658
00:57:24,375 --> 00:57:26,249
Sorry, daddy's got to work.

659
00:57:26,250 --> 00:57:28,690
- We have to clear our trays, Daddy.
- Not now.

660
00:57:39,625 --> 00:57:40,625
Fuck.

661
00:57:41,291 --> 00:57:42,458
That was close.

662
00:57:43,458 --> 00:57:45,707
- We should've maybe talked to Kynch.
- Should've done what?

663
00:57:45,708 --> 00:57:47,582
We don't know what's
happening here at all.

664
00:57:50,500 --> 00:57:51,750
Do you have a plan for that?

665
00:57:52,791 --> 00:57:54,958
I'll give it back
when this is all over.

666
00:57:56,125 --> 00:57:57,125
I...

667
00:57:58,666 --> 00:58:00,457
I thought it was
about the drugs.

668
00:58:00,458 --> 00:58:02,582
The drugs have nothing to
do with Josh's kidnapping.

669
00:58:02,583 --> 00:58:03,666
I'm back to square one.

670
00:58:14,250 --> 00:58:16,582
We'll find your boy.

671
00:58:16,583 --> 00:58:19,749
<i>We'll find your boy.</i>

672
00:58:19,750 --> 00:58:22,749
<i>We'll find your boy.</i>

673
00:58:26,750 --> 00:58:27,916
Yeah.

674
00:58:41,875 --> 00:58:43,708
You're
fucking late. Come on.

675
00:58:47,541 --> 00:58:49,999
I was able to deploy
malware on the server.

676
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:53,499
Now the IT support team is on
it. So you've got one hour max.

677
00:58:53,500 --> 00:58:55,624
Then the cameras are back online.

678
00:58:55,625 --> 00:58:58,208
- Floorplan, keycard.
- Key card. Yeah.

679
00:59:00,625 --> 00:59:01,708
Warehouse.

680
00:59:03,083 --> 00:59:05,083
- What is this?
- Uh, rec center.

681
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:07,290
And this?

682
00:59:07,291 --> 00:59:09,665
NSA and CIA facilities.
Now, can I have my stuff?

683
00:59:09,666 --> 00:59:12,207
- What are these?
- Detention cells.

684
00:59:12,208 --> 00:59:15,749
I've never been there, but supposedly they
were decommissioned after the Iraq War.

685
00:59:15,750 --> 00:59:17,290
Could somebody
hide a child there?

686
00:59:17,291 --> 00:59:20,749
Do you really think the CIA kidnapped your
kid because of some secret conspiracy?

687
00:59:20,750 --> 00:59:21,833
Sh!

688
00:59:36,541 --> 00:59:39,124
- Now, I just want my stuff.
- What do you know about Donovan?

689
00:59:39,125 --> 00:59:41,458
- Why?
- None of your business. So?

690
00:59:42,291 --> 00:59:45,332
He's just a dumb jock
and wannabe influencer.

691
00:59:45,333 --> 00:59:48,249
He crashed the system once
because he played an online game.

692
00:59:48,250 --> 00:59:49,790
And he lied about it too.

693
00:59:49,791 --> 00:59:51,082
Where is his office?

694
00:59:51,083 --> 00:59:53,832
On the second floor,
in this building here.

695
00:59:53,833 --> 00:59:56,415
Yeah. Yeah.

696
01:00:05,916 --> 01:00:08,999
- You had it with you all along?
- "You had it with you...?"

697
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:11,875
Mean. All right.

698
01:00:12,916 --> 01:00:15,040
I'll have to explain
how you got my card.

699
01:00:15,041 --> 01:00:17,375
- Uh, where?
- Hold this.

700
01:00:17,958 --> 01:00:18,958
Okay.

701
01:00:20,291 --> 01:00:22,290
It's gonna look like you
put up a fierce fight.

702
01:00:22,291 --> 01:00:23,749
What do you...

703
01:00:29,250 --> 01:00:32,416
What do you think Donovan had
to do with Josh's disappearance?

704
01:00:33,166 --> 01:00:35,124
Well, I hope that
we find some...

705
01:00:35,125 --> 01:00:36,333
Oh, fuck!

706
01:00:37,125 --> 01:00:39,790
Where should I meet
you? Office or Post One?

707
01:00:39,791 --> 01:00:40,958
Goddamn!

708
01:00:52,750 --> 01:00:54,707
Okay, what
are we looking for?

709
01:00:54,708 --> 01:00:57,416
Anything to do with
the kidnappers or with Josh.

710
01:01:05,333 --> 01:01:08,416
How's he have so much money?
Have a look at his emails.

711
01:01:09,041 --> 01:01:10,500
I'll look for your name too.

712
01:01:15,750 --> 01:01:17,166
Fuck.

713
01:01:17,916 --> 01:01:21,125
- What are you doing?
- Looking through the system files.

714
01:01:21,750 --> 01:01:23,166
Okay. This is...

715
01:01:23,958 --> 01:01:24,958
Frame...

716
01:01:29,166 --> 01:01:30,541
What the fuck?

717
01:01:32,791 --> 01:01:34,511
But that's the firm in
the US I'll work for.

718
01:01:38,833 --> 01:01:41,541
- Donovan got you the job.
- Looks that way.

719
01:01:51,500 --> 01:01:53,707
MASSIVE FLASHBACKS PSYCHOTIC-LIKE
DISSOCIATIVE BEHAVIOR

720
01:01:53,708 --> 01:01:57,250
He knew how you were doing.
He wanted you in the embassy.

721
01:02:00,375 --> 01:02:01,375
Okay.

722
01:02:01,958 --> 01:02:05,457
- The files about you were forwarded.
- To who?

723
01:02:05,458 --> 01:02:07,833
No idea. That's
not a real name.

724
01:02:08,458 --> 01:02:10,749
- Okay. I've gotta google the Consul.
- Wait!

725
01:02:10,750 --> 01:02:12,582
He'll see it in
his search history.

726
01:02:12,583 --> 01:02:14,249
Use this laptop here.

727
01:02:14,250 --> 01:02:17,040
Yes, Ms. Consul General.
It seems to be a software problem.

728
01:02:17,041 --> 01:02:19,957
It's got nothing to do with Sara
Wulf. She's still in the infirmary.

729
01:02:19,958 --> 01:02:21,540
Sergeant Donovan checked on her.

730
01:02:21,541 --> 01:02:24,958
The German authorities are picking
her up anytime now. All right.

731
01:02:26,125 --> 01:02:28,332
- Any update?
- Nothing.

732
01:02:28,333 --> 01:02:31,207
- Did you try to log in?
- I left my tablet in the office, sir.

733
01:02:31,208 --> 01:02:33,000
- Well, go get it.
- Yes, sir.

734
01:02:34,875 --> 01:02:37,790
- You think the Consul's a part of this?
- Yeah, definitely.

735
01:02:37,791 --> 01:02:40,916
It must be a high-up person to
manipulate the video and sneak people in.

736
01:02:43,041 --> 01:02:44,041
Look.

737
01:02:45,666 --> 01:02:48,000
Born in Wiesbaden. Harvard.

738
01:02:49,041 --> 01:02:50,040
There's nothing.

739
01:02:50,041 --> 01:02:52,499
- Okay, fine. Eric...
- I'm on it.

740
01:02:52,500 --> 01:02:53,916
Eric Kynch.

741
01:02:54,500 --> 01:02:55,958
Consulate Frankfurt.

742
01:02:57,833 --> 01:02:59,791
He was also a
soldier in Afghanistan.

743
01:03:01,583 --> 01:03:03,833
Down, down, down. Wait.

744
01:03:06,416 --> 01:03:09,540
"Regional Specialist in
Islamabad, Pakistan."

745
01:03:17,166 --> 01:03:19,500
- I'm checking my mail.
- What? Why?

746
01:03:26,125 --> 01:03:28,208
Searna Hotel, Islamabad.

747
01:03:31,291 --> 01:03:32,333
That's Kynch.

748
01:03:35,375 --> 01:03:36,665
What is this video?

749
01:03:36,666 --> 01:03:39,000
It's related to our
deployment in Afghanistan.

750
01:03:40,375 --> 01:03:41,749
It's where Evan was killed.

751
01:03:46,333 --> 01:03:49,290
0175 165 89. Okay.

752
01:03:49,291 --> 01:03:51,832
- They screen every call here!
- It doesn't matter.

753
01:03:51,833 --> 01:03:54,916
- Who are you calling?
- The journalist who sent the video.

754
01:03:57,916 --> 01:03:59,624
<i>Clarativ, this is Güney.</i>

755
01:03:59,625 --> 01:04:02,707
- This is Sara Wulf. You sent me the video.
- <i>Thank you for...</i>

756
01:04:02,708 --> 01:04:04,332
One of the men is Eric Kynch.

757
01:04:04,333 --> 01:04:07,040
- <i>Uh, that's correct.</i>
- What do you know about him?

758
01:04:07,041 --> 01:04:10,707
<i>Okay, so, uh, Eric Kynch had to end
his military career because of injury.</i>

759
01:04:10,708 --> 01:04:13,457
<i>His name pops up time and again
in connection with corruption,</i>

760
01:04:13,458 --> 01:04:15,332
<i>but he's been
exonerated every time.</i>

761
01:04:15,333 --> 01:04:17,165
<i>But now I have a new
source in Pakistan</i>

762
01:04:17,166 --> 01:04:18,915
<i>who claims that
Kynch was responsible</i>

763
01:04:18,916 --> 01:04:21,249
<i>for the ambush you walked
into in Afghanistan.</i>

764
01:04:21,250 --> 01:04:22,374
What?

765
01:04:29,583 --> 01:04:30,583
Shit.

766
01:04:32,291 --> 01:04:33,124
Sara, we've gotta go.

767
01:04:33,125 --> 01:04:35,915
<i>However, I'm still missing
one crucial identification.</i>

768
01:04:35,916 --> 01:04:37,957
<i>Who's the man Kynch is
talking to in the video?</i>

769
01:04:37,958 --> 01:04:39,624
- I'm not sure.
- Sara, come on!

770
01:04:39,625 --> 01:04:42,415
<i>You can see him in the
mirror. Do you know him?</i>

771
01:04:42,416 --> 01:04:45,707
Uh, I... I can't make him out.
He... he's not really clear.

772
01:04:45,708 --> 01:04:47,582
<i>There's an enhanced screenshot.</i>

773
01:04:47,583 --> 01:04:48,707
<i>- If I...</i>
- Send it over. Yeah.

774
01:04:48,708 --> 01:04:50,665
<i>- Ms. Wulf? What is...</i>
- Thanks.

775
01:04:50,666 --> 01:04:53,332
- Shit, I can't open it. I can't open it.
- What's wrong?

776
01:04:53,333 --> 01:04:55,083
I've got it. I've got it.

777
01:04:58,750 --> 01:04:59,833
Okay, got it.

778
01:05:01,541 --> 01:05:03,000
Fuck.

779
01:05:03,666 --> 01:05:04,916
- Come on!
- Come on.

780
01:05:07,125 --> 01:05:07,999
Come on.

781
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:09,249
Come on.

782
01:05:09,250 --> 01:05:10,916
Come on, come on. Now!

783
01:05:16,750 --> 01:05:18,190
This way!

784
01:05:24,291 --> 01:05:25,915
Backup! They're heading
to the cafeteria!

785
01:05:25,916 --> 01:05:28,208
Move! Move!

786
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:35,291
Get out of the way!

787
01:05:40,958 --> 01:05:42,000
Door.

788
01:05:48,708 --> 01:05:51,250
- Elevator?
- Takes too long. This way.

789
01:06:01,250 --> 01:06:02,250
Shit.

790
01:06:03,875 --> 01:06:04,957
Fuck.

791
01:06:04,958 --> 01:06:06,708
They went
through that door.

792
01:06:19,875 --> 01:06:21,958
Clear! Let's go.

793
01:06:44,041 --> 01:06:45,582
What happened
in Afghanistan?

794
01:06:45,583 --> 01:06:48,291
There were two teams.
Us and the Americans.

795
01:06:49,083 --> 01:06:51,124
And the first night
we were attacked.

796
01:06:51,125 --> 01:06:54,375
We neutralized a few. In the end,
though, there were just too many.

797
01:06:56,041 --> 01:07:00,000
When the helicopters finally
arrived, they were all dead.

798
01:07:03,125 --> 01:07:05,124
Or, well, all except me

799
01:07:07,208 --> 01:07:08,790
I've... I've asked...

800
01:07:08,791 --> 01:07:12,000
I've asked myself why.
Why me and no one else?

801
01:07:14,250 --> 01:07:15,291
Not just you.

802
01:07:16,375 --> 01:07:17,541
You and Josh.

803
01:07:29,791 --> 01:07:30,833
Here's the photo.

804
01:07:35,750 --> 01:07:37,833
How do you suppose
Kynch is involved?

805
01:07:46,500 --> 01:07:47,875
Sara?

806
01:07:48,458 --> 01:07:49,624
Have you seen that man?

807
01:07:49,625 --> 01:07:51,290
Get
out! It's an ambush.

808
01:07:51,291 --> 01:07:52,790
Come on, move it!

809
01:07:52,791 --> 01:07:55,415
- Clear!
- Move on there. Survey! Go!

810
01:07:55,416 --> 01:07:56,457
Enemy down.

811
01:08:03,083 --> 01:08:06,916
- We've gotta get to the warehouse.
- What? What for?

812
01:08:08,250 --> 01:08:09,582
We have enough evidence now!

813
01:08:09,583 --> 01:08:11,832
Donovan had you come here
and covered up my kidnapping.

814
01:08:11,833 --> 01:08:14,790
Kynch is involved in your
past, we have no idea how.

815
01:08:14,791 --> 01:08:16,457
But we have to
talk to the Consul.

816
01:08:16,458 --> 01:08:17,957
Sara, this makes no sense!

817
01:08:17,958 --> 01:08:20,374
Let's check the building where
they keep the detention cells.

818
01:08:20,375 --> 01:08:22,040
And besides, what's
in the photo?

819
01:08:23,416 --> 01:08:25,999
Sara!

820
01:08:28,375 --> 01:08:30,000
- And?
<i>- We lost them.</i>

821
01:08:31,375 --> 01:08:32,958
<i>And I checked my tablet.</i>

822
01:08:33,583 --> 01:08:34,875
<i>She found the emails.</i>

823
01:08:35,666 --> 01:08:36,666
<i>She knows.</i>

824
01:08:37,541 --> 01:08:38,499
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

825
01:08:54,500 --> 01:08:56,749
Watch out for that mirror.

826
01:08:56,750 --> 01:08:58,040
What are we doing here?

827
01:08:58,041 --> 01:08:59,875
You'll book the train to France.

828
01:09:00,666 --> 01:09:02,665
In Paris, buy a plane
ticket to Mexico.

829
01:09:02,666 --> 01:09:05,624
You've got a good chance of crossing
the border into the US from there.

830
01:09:07,375 --> 01:09:11,457
They'll be leaving soon. Just
hide in the back of the truck.

831
01:09:11,458 --> 01:09:12,833
I'm sorry, you...

832
01:09:13,916 --> 01:09:15,958
- You said we'd...
- I know what Kynch did.

833
01:09:17,500 --> 01:09:21,000
I figured out why I'm here.
It's too big, you have to go.

834
01:09:22,583 --> 01:09:23,874
What about you?

835
01:09:23,875 --> 01:09:26,290
I, uh, I'll be fine. Okay?

836
01:09:27,958 --> 01:09:29,125
I'll be fine.

837
01:09:31,500 --> 01:09:32,500
Go now.

838
01:09:34,333 --> 01:09:35,833
Find your mother, okay?

839
01:09:36,416 --> 01:09:38,291
- I'll distract them.
- Okay.

840
01:09:39,208 --> 01:09:40,208
Okay.

841
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:50,000
Hey!

842
01:09:50,833 --> 01:09:53,041
Stop! Who are you?

843
01:09:54,333 --> 01:09:56,457
Hey, what's going on?

844
01:09:56,458 --> 01:09:57,541
Hey!

845
01:10:00,750 --> 01:10:02,333
I said, don't move!

846
01:10:03,166 --> 01:10:04,790
Get out of the car! Now!

847
01:10:07,125 --> 01:10:09,832
Stop or I'll shoot!

848
01:10:32,583 --> 01:10:34,499
Stop, or I'll shoot!

849
01:10:41,916 --> 01:10:43,916
Sara, stop! Stop right there!

850
01:10:49,875 --> 01:10:51,625
Hey, stop! Don't move!

851
01:10:52,166 --> 01:10:54,624
Come back here!
You can't be here!

852
01:10:54,625 --> 01:10:56,582
You're under arrest.

853
01:11:00,416 --> 01:11:01,832
Wait! Hey, you!

854
01:11:16,458 --> 01:11:18,958
Hey! What's your problem?

855
01:11:21,291 --> 01:11:22,624
Stop right there!

856
01:11:53,416 --> 01:11:56,333
You just won't give up, will you?

857
01:12:14,333 --> 01:12:15,500
Aah!

858
01:12:29,291 --> 01:12:31,540
Fuck!

859
01:13:12,250 --> 01:13:13,583
Where's Josh?

860
01:13:14,208 --> 01:13:15,708
Tell me where he is!

861
01:13:16,375 --> 01:13:18,458
- Tell me now!
- He's okay.

862
01:13:19,958 --> 01:13:21,000
I have your son.

863
01:13:22,125 --> 01:13:23,458
He's just fine.

864
01:13:27,750 --> 01:13:29,250
You kidnapped my son, why?

865
01:13:30,750 --> 01:13:32,750
You could've just
killed us outside.

866
01:13:33,916 --> 01:13:35,125
Like some freak accident.

867
01:13:36,458 --> 01:13:37,458
How d'you find out?

868
01:13:39,625 --> 01:13:41,165
I saw the video.

869
01:13:41,166 --> 01:13:42,415
In Islamabad,

870
01:13:42,416 --> 01:13:45,665
you met with one of the members
of the Taliban who attacked us.

871
01:13:45,666 --> 01:13:47,249
I can identify the man.

872
01:13:47,250 --> 01:13:49,458
I'm the only surviving witness.

873
01:13:50,583 --> 01:13:54,208
I found out that you revealed
our position to them.

874
01:13:58,041 --> 01:13:59,041
What for?

875
01:14:00,541 --> 01:14:02,416
I'd have left you alone, Sara.

876
01:14:03,041 --> 01:14:06,457
But this journalist, he
put so much pressure on me.

877
01:14:06,458 --> 01:14:07,791
Where's Josh?

878
01:14:11,208 --> 01:14:12,624
Fucking talk!

879
01:14:12,625 --> 01:14:14,875
I'm the only one
who knows where Josh is.

880
01:14:15,833 --> 01:14:19,040
If you pull the trigger
now, he'll starve to death.

881
01:14:21,666 --> 01:14:24,791
What do you wanna do now? My
people'll be here any minute.

882
01:14:29,500 --> 01:14:30,875
I'll find Josh myself.

883
01:15:10,250 --> 01:15:11,250
Josh?

884
01:15:32,875 --> 01:15:33,875
Josh?

885
01:16:24,875 --> 01:16:26,041
Officer down!

886
01:16:29,208 --> 01:16:30,416
Are you okay, sir?

887
01:16:34,333 --> 01:16:38,165
We lost her. But she's
probably still on the compound.

888
01:16:38,166 --> 01:16:40,082
Sir, we have to
trigger an alarm.

889
01:16:40,083 --> 01:16:42,249
No, we will follow
daily protocol.

890
01:16:42,250 --> 01:16:43,582
But according to regulations...

891
01:16:43,583 --> 01:16:46,166
No, you will report directly
to me and no one else.

892
01:17:24,375 --> 01:17:26,540
<i>I repeat.
Explosion in building E.</i>

893
01:17:26,541 --> 01:17:28,040
Explosion in building E.

894
01:17:28,041 --> 01:17:29,375
That was her.

895
01:17:41,750 --> 01:17:44,832
- Why isn't she on the cameras?
- She must have dodged them, sir.

896
01:17:47,583 --> 01:17:50,332
- Yes, Ms. Consul General?
- What's going on, Mr. Kynch?

897
01:17:50,333 --> 01:17:52,665
Well, th... there's
been an explosion.

898
01:17:52,666 --> 01:17:55,875
Is that so? What about the attack
at the recreational center?

899
01:17:56,750 --> 01:17:59,040
I... I'm sorry. There was a glitch
in the chain of command, I...

900
01:17:59,041 --> 01:18:00,708
<i>Stop bullshitting me.</i>

901
01:18:01,291 --> 01:18:02,625
And follow protocol.

902
01:18:03,875 --> 01:18:06,208
Yes, ma'am. Fuck!

903
01:18:06,916 --> 01:18:08,665
Go to code red! Shoot on sight!

904
01:18:08,666 --> 01:18:11,749
Go!

905
01:18:11,750 --> 01:18:14,249
<i>Please
follow emergency procedures.</i>

906
01:18:14,250 --> 01:18:19,374
<i>Head to your nearest assembly point
and await further instructions.</i>

907
01:18:21,125 --> 01:18:23,332
<i>Attention.
This is an emergency.</i>

908
01:18:23,333 --> 01:18:24,333
Clear!

909
01:18:28,458 --> 01:18:30,040
Come!
All right, everybody!

910
01:18:31,125 --> 01:18:33,207
- Clear.
- To your right.

911
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:38,790
All right.
Everybody, keep it moving.

912
01:18:40,166 --> 01:18:41,708
I want to go home.

913
01:18:43,666 --> 01:18:44,666
Aileen?

914
01:18:47,583 --> 01:18:50,332
- I'm Sara. I'm here to pick...
- How do you know my name?

915
01:18:50,333 --> 01:18:52,333
- What happened to your face?
- Oh.

916
01:18:53,708 --> 01:18:56,791
I'm a friend of your father's.
He asked me to pick you up.

917
01:18:57,375 --> 01:18:59,333
I must not go with strangers.

918
01:19:00,458 --> 01:19:03,791
Yeah, you're right.
But I'm not a stranger.

919
01:19:04,583 --> 01:19:06,708
I'm a friend, promise.

920
01:19:07,291 --> 01:19:09,707
See? Your father gave me this.

921
01:19:09,708 --> 01:19:11,250
Mr. Rabbit!

922
01:19:13,208 --> 01:19:14,208
Come on.

923
01:19:16,083 --> 01:19:18,541
Go, go!

924
01:19:33,666 --> 01:19:36,250
This is a safe room.
My daddy told me all about it.

925
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:38,625
You're a very smart girl.

926
01:19:40,541 --> 01:19:43,125
{\an8}Post One.

927
01:19:45,500 --> 01:19:48,082
Section A is cleared.
Team Alpha, move to section C.

928
01:19:53,208 --> 01:19:56,375
You shouldn't be in the safe
room. The compound is being evacuated.

929
01:19:58,958 --> 01:20:00,083
Sir, it's for you.

930
01:20:02,875 --> 01:20:03,958
Eric Kynch?

931
01:20:09,208 --> 01:20:12,207

933
01:20:15,791 --> 01:20:17,000
<i>Sara?</i>

934
01:20:18,583 --> 01:20:19,583
<i>Sara?</i>

935
01:20:27,875 --> 01:20:29,583
I explained that I
was babysitting her.

936
01:20:30,958 --> 01:20:32,416
<i>Can I speak to my girl?</i>

937
01:20:37,083 --> 01:20:39,125
Sweetie? Your dad.

938
01:20:43,833 --> 01:20:46,582
- Daddy?
<i>- Hey, little bug, you all right?</i>

939
01:20:46,583 --> 01:20:48,499
Yeah. Are you coming to get me?

940
01:20:48,500 --> 01:20:51,457
<i>No, I'm sorry, little bug.
Daddy's gotta work a little longer.</i>

941
01:20:51,458 --> 01:20:54,500
<i>Sara is gonna take care of you.
I'll pick you up soon, okay?</i>

942
01:20:55,083 --> 01:20:56,707
Okay. Love you.

943
01:20:56,708 --> 01:20:58,790
<i>I love you
too, little bug.</i>

944
01:21:03,500 --> 01:21:05,541
<i>What do you want?</i>

945
01:21:06,625 --> 01:21:08,125
I want my son returned.

946
01:21:09,541 --> 01:21:11,207
<i>- Ms. Wulf...</i>
- And I want you to confess.

947
01:21:11,208 --> 01:21:12,583
I'm not having fun anymore.

948
01:21:13,250 --> 01:21:15,915
This door is ten centimeters
thick, reinforced steel.

949
01:21:15,916 --> 01:21:18,916
If you wanna blow it up, you're
gonna risk killing your daughter.

950
01:21:20,083 --> 01:21:22,583
- You'll be too slow drilling.
<i>- For what?</i>

951
01:21:23,250 --> 01:21:25,166
Because we'll run out of oxygen.

952
01:21:26,041 --> 01:21:29,082
If you call this room again,
better show me my son's face.

953
01:21:36,708 --> 01:21:37,791
Sara?

954
01:21:39,625 --> 01:21:40,624
Sara?

955
01:21:40,625 --> 01:21:41,707
Copy.

956
01:21:45,625 --> 01:21:46,916
She's turned off the air supply.

957
01:21:48,333 --> 01:21:49,915
- Can we turn it back on?
- No.

958
01:21:49,916 --> 01:21:51,999
These units are completely
self-sufficient.

959
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:54,625
There has to be some
other way to get back in!

960
01:22:11,583 --> 01:22:13,958
- Do you wanna play another game?
- Yeah.

961
01:22:14,833 --> 01:22:18,958
Okay. I spy with my
little eye something that is...

962
01:22:19,541 --> 01:22:20,499
red.

963
01:22:43,666 --> 01:22:45,291
What's going on here, Eric?

964
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:48,749
- Why is this happening?
- Everything is going to be all right.

965
01:22:48,750 --> 01:22:51,457
Don't you worry. It's okay.

966
01:22:53,250 --> 01:22:56,625
I spy with
my little eye...

967
01:22:58,000 --> 01:23:01,375
something... that is...

968
01:23:02,208 --> 01:23:03,208
green.

969
01:23:04,625 --> 01:23:05,833
The blanket?

970
01:23:07,416 --> 01:23:08,416
No.

971
01:23:13,041 --> 01:23:14,041
That box?

972
01:23:16,166 --> 01:23:17,166
No.

973
01:23:20,583 --> 01:23:21,791
Are you okay?

974
01:23:24,333 --> 01:23:26,291
I'm... very tired.

975
01:23:27,125 --> 01:23:28,333
Come, lie down.

976
01:23:47,375 --> 01:23:49,000
<i>Sara?</i>

977
01:23:53,750 --> 01:23:55,332
Where's my son?

978
01:23:55,333 --> 01:23:57,666
<i>Sara, please let
the girl go free.</i>

979
01:23:58,458 --> 01:24:00,618
Have you got a clue what
they're keeping from you here?

980
01:24:01,166 --> 01:24:02,916
<i>Do you know about
Eric Kynch's past?</i>

981
01:24:03,500 --> 01:24:05,415
- W... Why did she say your name?
- I have no idea.

982
01:24:05,416 --> 01:24:06,999
- <i>He's corrupt.</i>
- What's going on?

983
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:07,915
She's delusional.

984
01:24:07,916 --> 01:24:10,125
Eight deaths the
man's responsible for.

985
01:24:10,833 --> 01:24:13,207
<i>And he knows I am the only
one who can incriminate him.</i>

986
01:24:13,208 --> 01:24:15,000
That's why he wants me buried.

987
01:24:17,000 --> 01:24:19,665
<i>Sara, please, just
come outside for now.</i>

988
01:24:19,666 --> 01:24:22,166
<i>You can't possibly
want the girl to die.</i>

989
01:24:23,083 --> 01:24:24,500
I wanna speak to him now.

990
01:24:26,208 --> 01:24:28,958
<i>How?</i>

991
01:24:35,666 --> 01:24:36,916
Are you serious?

992
01:24:38,125 --> 01:24:39,125
<i>What are you saying?</i>

993
01:24:39,708 --> 01:24:42,624
You would watch me kill your
daughter before you go to prison?

994
01:24:42,625 --> 01:24:46,416
<i>She's done nothing wrong
here. But you wanna kill her?</i>

995
01:24:48,708 --> 01:24:52,291
<i>I know... that you're not
capable of that, Sara.</i>

996
01:24:55,500 --> 01:24:56,915
<i>You're not a murderer.</i>

997
01:25:13,750 --> 01:25:15,208
The lantern?

998
01:25:22,708 --> 01:25:23,708
What?

999
01:25:24,250 --> 01:25:27,708
I spy with your little
eye... the lantern.

1000
01:25:31,208 --> 01:25:32,208
Yeah.

1001
01:25:34,916 --> 01:25:36,875
Yeah, that's right.

1002
01:25:38,083 --> 01:25:39,333
Are you alright?

1003
01:25:44,083 --> 01:25:46,416
I was just thinking
about my son.

1004
01:25:47,375 --> 01:25:49,208
We love to play that game too.

1005
01:25:50,416 --> 01:25:51,541
What's his name?

1006
01:25:52,750 --> 01:25:56,625
His name is Josh. He's a
little younger than you.

1007
01:25:57,625 --> 01:25:59,041
And where is he now?

1008
01:26:01,208 --> 01:26:02,208
I don't know.

1009
01:26:45,208 --> 01:26:46,208
Come on, sweetie.

1010
01:26:47,708 --> 01:26:50,250
- Where are we going?
- You're going home.

1011
01:27:09,416 --> 01:27:10,875
I'll let Aileen go free.

1012
01:27:12,958 --> 01:27:14,208
But I wanna talk to you.

1013
01:27:15,250 --> 01:27:16,375
Just the two of us, here.

1014
01:27:17,250 --> 01:27:18,500
<i>Okay, Sara.</i>

1015
01:27:19,208 --> 01:27:20,915
Clear the area.

1016
01:27:20,916 --> 01:27:23,083
<i>All right. Everybody fall back.</i>

1017
01:27:24,333 --> 01:27:25,458
<i>Fall back.</i>

1018
01:27:26,875 --> 01:27:27,916
More!

1019
01:28:01,833 --> 01:28:03,375
<i>Thank you, Ms. Wulf.</i>

1020
01:28:04,250 --> 01:28:06,083
<i>Will you now please
come out as well?</i>

1021
01:28:07,166 --> 01:28:08,541
No.

1022
01:28:09,291 --> 01:28:11,957
I want Kynch to come in.
That's what we planned.

1023
01:28:35,125 --> 01:28:36,416
I'm not gonna hurt you.

1024
01:28:38,166 --> 01:28:42,291
You... will never release
Josh while I'm still alive.

1025
01:28:43,666 --> 01:28:46,041
Regardless of whether I
promise to stay quiet.

1026
01:28:47,875 --> 01:28:49,582
Just tell them

1027
01:28:49,583 --> 01:28:51,750
<i>that I put up too
much resistance.</i>

1028
01:28:52,625 --> 01:28:55,915
<i>And as soon as you walk through that
door, I'll shut off the air supply again.</i>

1029
01:28:55,916 --> 01:28:59,666
<i>That... wouldn't surprise
anyone given my condition.</i>

1030
01:29:01,250 --> 01:29:03,875
Just promise me you'll
bring Josh to my mother.

1031
01:29:06,500 --> 01:29:07,833
Please promise me that.

1032
01:29:12,041 --> 01:29:13,624
No!

1033
01:29:23,458 --> 01:29:24,458
Please.

1034
01:29:25,416 --> 01:29:27,208
Please, let Josh and me go free.

1035
01:29:28,458 --> 01:29:30,208
I'm sure you know
I can't do that.

1036
01:29:39,041 --> 01:29:40,708
Why take my boy away?

1037
01:29:41,916 --> 01:29:43,583
Why go through all the effort?

1038
01:29:45,125 --> 01:29:46,750
Please, Kynch, you
owe me an answer.

1039
01:30:07,875 --> 01:30:09,500
I made a fucking mistake.

1040
01:30:10,500 --> 01:30:11,874
A big one too.

1041
01:30:11,875 --> 01:30:15,583
I underestimated you. "She's a
fighter, she doesn't give up."

1042
01:30:16,166 --> 01:30:18,208
Everyone who knew you said that.

1043
01:30:20,250 --> 01:30:23,625
I didn't think you'd succeed in
getting out of the visitors' building.

1044
01:30:24,958 --> 01:30:28,124
<i>It all started to go wrong when
you witnessed the bag exchange.</i>

1045
01:30:28,125 --> 01:30:30,832
<i>An unfortunate coincidence,
but also my mistake.</i>

1046
01:30:30,833 --> 01:30:33,083
<i>I should've known about
Martello's side business.</i>

1047
01:30:35,041 --> 01:30:37,499
<i>That's why you broke
into another building,</i>

1048
01:30:37,500 --> 01:30:39,665
<i>which was never
part of the plan.</i>

1049
01:30:43,500 --> 01:30:46,000
<i>Still, I decided
not to interfere.</i>

1050
01:30:46,583 --> 01:30:50,833
<i>Even after you met Kira Wolkow, we
were still in control of the situation.</i>

1051
01:30:53,333 --> 01:30:55,457
<i>The abduction was supposed
to go down as planned.</i>

1052
01:30:55,458 --> 01:30:59,082
<i>But none of us were prepared for you
to eliminate two trained assassins</i>

1053
01:30:59,083 --> 01:31:00,958
and stop the whole plan.

1054
01:31:04,458 --> 01:31:06,499
The whole fucking plan
went down the drain.

1055
01:31:09,791 --> 01:31:11,791
The kidnappers were let
in on your authority.

1056
01:31:12,791 --> 01:31:15,832
{\an8}<i>You made sure I'd be offered
the job in America so I'd come.</i>

1057
01:31:15,833 --> 01:31:17,916
<i>You stay
here. Do not move.</i>

1058
01:31:18,916 --> 01:31:21,082
<i>Sergeant, please
take your break now.</i>

1059
01:31:21,083 --> 01:31:23,415
<i>And you made sure
I'd be able to escape.</i>

1060
01:31:23,416 --> 01:31:26,624
<i>You wanted me to be on the
loose in the consulate.</i>

1061
01:31:26,625 --> 01:31:29,707
<i>We can't let a special forces
soldier roam free on our premises.</i>

1062
01:31:29,708 --> 01:31:31,416
<i>She's just a scared mother.</i>

1063
01:31:32,333 --> 01:31:34,666
<i>You knew I'd do
anything to find my son.</i>

1064
01:31:48,166 --> 01:31:51,457
If someone like Kira were
simply to vanish from here,

1065
01:31:51,458 --> 01:31:53,541
it'd be too big to get off free.

1066
01:31:54,125 --> 01:31:56,041
They would ask too
many questions of you.

1067
01:31:56,833 --> 01:32:00,041
Yeah, but the loony tunes
ex-soldier running around loose?

1068
01:32:01,375 --> 01:32:03,375
Perfect scapegoat
for everything.

1069
01:32:03,958 --> 01:32:06,582
And then you could shoot the only
witness left from Afghanistan

1070
01:32:06,583 --> 01:32:08,041
while she's on the run.

1071
01:32:09,250 --> 01:32:10,791
Icing on the cake.

1072
01:32:12,541 --> 01:32:14,750
How much were you
paid for it? Huh?

1073
01:32:15,875 --> 01:32:17,500
To open the door to kidnappers?

1074
01:32:21,041 --> 01:32:23,000
How come you are
where you are, Sara?

1075
01:32:23,916 --> 01:32:25,165
Hm?

1076
01:32:25,166 --> 01:32:27,541
Because the Bundeswehr
took good care of you?

1077
01:32:28,625 --> 01:32:31,375
No, you ceased to properly
function, and they left you hanging.

1078
01:32:32,166 --> 01:32:33,375
Isn't that right?

1079
01:32:33,958 --> 01:32:36,333
I busted my ass for them!

1080
01:32:38,083 --> 01:32:41,833
Military college scholarship,
OCS with honors, and then... Bam!

1081
01:32:43,333 --> 01:32:45,125
One RCM hits your vehicle.

1082
01:32:45,708 --> 01:32:48,165
After six months, they say
you're all right again.

1083
01:32:48,166 --> 01:32:49,915
You can't even get out
of bed in the morning

1084
01:32:49,916 --> 01:32:51,415
'cause you are so
fucking depressed.

1085
01:32:51,416 --> 01:32:54,249
And they say, "Okay, get behind
a desk, that's where you belong."

1086
01:32:54,250 --> 01:32:56,583
"Career dead end,
take it or leave it."

1087
01:32:58,125 --> 01:33:00,458
Your family moves
every couple of years.

1088
01:33:01,166 --> 01:33:03,624
Your daughter's never
gonna have a proper home.

1089
01:33:03,625 --> 01:33:07,415
And they don't even give you enough money
to pay for her to go to college some day.

1090
01:33:07,416 --> 01:33:08,416
Fuck 'em!

1091
01:33:09,500 --> 01:33:10,500
Fuck 'em!

1092
01:33:15,750 --> 01:33:17,041
I owe them nothing.

1093
01:33:19,833 --> 01:33:20,958
They owe me.

1094
01:33:23,000 --> 01:33:24,125
They owe me.

1095
01:33:26,833 --> 01:33:27,833
You know...

1096
01:33:29,625 --> 01:33:31,375
we're not so different, Sara.

1097
01:33:33,500 --> 01:33:35,625
I'm doing this for my family.

1098
01:33:36,541 --> 01:33:38,500
But my family you destroyed.

1099
01:33:43,708 --> 01:33:45,083
Josh has no father.

1100
01:33:48,208 --> 01:33:50,333
And you've already
murdered eight people.

1101
01:33:53,583 --> 01:33:55,166
I am sorry, Sara.

1102
01:33:57,208 --> 01:33:59,833
I thought I sold them
just useless intel.

1103
01:34:02,333 --> 01:34:04,958
I can't listen to
your whining. Get out.

1104
01:34:06,708 --> 01:34:08,250
I said out!

1105
01:34:10,625 --> 01:34:12,875
Guess you never do give
up the fight, Sara.

1106
01:34:13,833 --> 01:34:14,832
And that's why...

1107
01:34:27,291 --> 01:34:30,207
Motherfucker! I knew
I'd hate that part.

1108
01:34:38,416 --> 01:34:39,875
She got my gun!

1109
01:34:40,500 --> 01:34:41,874
She got my gun!

1110
01:34:41,875 --> 01:34:44,875
- Are you hurt?
- Secure the door! Medic!

1111
01:35:24,333 --> 01:35:26,373
- It's an ambush!
- Move it!

1112
01:35:27,208 --> 01:35:30,457
- Clear! Get out, get out!
- Incoming!

1113
01:36:41,500 --> 01:36:42,541
<i>Mommy?</i>

1114
01:36:45,541 --> 01:36:46,583
<i>Mommy?</i>

1115
01:37:42,291 --> 01:37:43,833
Explosive in place.

1116
01:37:55,208 --> 01:37:56,290
Armed.

1117
01:37:59,916 --> 01:38:01,083
Five...

1118
01:38:05,500 --> 01:38:06,750
Four...

1119
01:38:09,875 --> 01:38:11,458
Three...

1120
01:38:16,041 --> 01:38:17,583
Two...

1121
01:38:19,166 --> 01:38:20,165
One.

1122
01:38:22,208 --> 01:38:24,416
<i>I made a fucking mistake.</i>

1123
01:38:25,333 --> 01:38:26,541
<i>A big one too.</i>

1124
01:38:27,666 --> 01:38:31,083
<i>I underestimated you. "She's a
fighter. She doesn't give up."</i>

1125
01:38:32,000 --> 01:38:34,458
<i>Everyone who knew you said that.</i>

1126
01:38:36,291 --> 01:38:40,415
<i>But I didn't think you'd succeed in
getting out of the visitors' building</i>

1127
01:38:40,416 --> 01:38:42,208
<i>and stop the whole plan.</i>

1128
01:38:44,875 --> 01:38:46,874
<i>The whole fucking plan
went down the drain.</i>

1129
01:38:46,875 --> 01:38:49,791
<i>The kidnappers
were let in on your authority.</i>

1130
01:38:50,750 --> 01:38:52,832
<i>And you made sure I'd
be able to escape.</i>

1131
01:38:52,833 --> 01:38:55,541
<i>You wanted me to be on the
loose in the consulate.</i>

1132
01:38:59,875 --> 01:39:02,125
Stop!
Get on the ground!

1133
01:39:07,750 --> 01:39:09,083
Where's the boy?

1134
01:39:14,708 --> 01:39:16,458
Please
don't give up now.

1135
01:39:39,375 --> 01:39:40,457
<i>Mommy?</i>

1136
01:39:47,291 --> 01:39:49,124
Her
condition is stable now.

1137
01:39:49,125 --> 01:39:51,082
We can take her
outside right away.

1138
01:39:54,000 --> 01:39:55,000
Mommy?

1139
01:39:56,541 --> 01:39:57,541
Mommy?

1140
01:40:04,208 --> 01:40:05,540
Give 'em a minute.

1141
01:40:05,541 --> 01:40:07,083
Hello, my darling.

1142
01:40:13,750 --> 01:40:15,708
How are you, Josh?

1143
01:40:16,750 --> 01:40:17,750
Fine.

1144
01:40:22,083 --> 01:40:23,208
Come here.

1145
01:40:34,541 --> 01:40:35,541
Mm.

1146
01:40:43,583 --> 01:40:46,375
EIGHT WEEKS LATER

1147
01:40:49,208 --> 01:40:51,457
Kynch is detained in the US.

1148
01:40:51,458 --> 01:40:53,291
The General Consul let me know.

1149
01:40:53,875 --> 01:40:56,249
And they found out that the
guy who helped us check in

1150
01:40:56,250 --> 01:40:58,374
was involved with the
whole thing as well.

1151
01:40:58,375 --> 01:41:00,665
<i>And Martello? The tech guy?</i>

1152
01:41:00,666 --> 01:41:03,041
Oh, he fled the same day.
It would appear he's hiding.

1153
01:41:03,791 --> 01:41:05,415
<i>Okay, crazy.</i>

1154
01:41:05,416 --> 01:41:06,416
Yeah.

1155
01:41:07,250 --> 01:41:08,416
<i>How are you?</i>

1156
01:41:09,500 --> 01:41:10,875
Yeah, good.

1157
01:41:12,333 --> 01:41:14,000
Doc says I'll be just fine.

1158
01:41:15,666 --> 01:41:17,207
Oh, I'm off. That's my ride.

1159
01:41:17,208 --> 01:41:20,208
<i>All good. Well, I'll see you in a
bit. You have a good flight, yeah?</i>

1160
01:41:21,041 --> 01:41:22,790
Thank you. Say hi
to your mother.

1161
01:41:22,791 --> 01:41:26,208
<i>- I will. See you soon, psycho.</i>
- See you.

1162
01:41:37,708 --> 01:41:38,707
Bye, Mom.

1163
01:41:38,708 --> 01:41:42,125
Take care of
yourself, okay? And of Josh.

1164
01:41:45,083 --> 01:41:47,083
I will. I promise.

1165
01:41:47,666 --> 01:41:48,874
You will.

1166
01:41:48,875 --> 01:41:50,625
I'll call you
when we've landed.

1167
01:41:59,875 --> 01:42:01,333
What is it, Mommy?

1168
01:42:15,333 --> 01:42:17,000
Just a helicopter, bud.

1169
01:42:18,500 --> 01:42:20,207
Are we leaving soon?

1170
01:42:20,208 --> 01:42:22,415
Yeah. So let's go.
