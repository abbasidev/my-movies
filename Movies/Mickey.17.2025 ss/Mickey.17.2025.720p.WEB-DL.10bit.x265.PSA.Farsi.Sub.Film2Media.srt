00:10:16,074 --> 00:10:17,783
He has plenty.

171
00:10:17,784 --> 00:10:20,120
This building's just
one of his many assets.

172
00:10:21,038 --> 00:10:23,289
Watching his delinquent
borrowers die,

173
00:10:23,290 --> 00:10:25,458
savoring the details of death...

174
00:10:25,459 --> 00:10:27,669
that, he truly enjoys.

175
00:10:27,794 --> 00:10:30,004
The message is clear. You can
stop now. We can stop, you know?

176
00:10:30,005 --> 00:10:31,797
It's... It's... I hear you.

177
00:10:31,798 --> 00:10:34,217
You know, two weeks, two
weeks is all it takes.

178
00:10:34,218 --> 00:10:36,511
All it takes now.
A-A-And more is coming,

179
00:10:36,512 --> 00:10:37,845

days ago in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia.

00:10:52,569 --> 00:10:53,946
Looks expensive.

185
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:58,616
Rest assured, anyone
who misses the deadline,

186
00:10:58,617 --> 00:11:00,869
we chase them to the
ends of the Earth.

187

Waves upon waves of people
desperate to leave Earth.

198
00:11:30,065 --> 00:11:33,442
It's clear anti-migrationists
are talking to a brick wall

199
00:11:33,443 --> 00:11:35,778
when they insist on
fixing up the Earth,

200
00:11:35,779 --> 00:11:40,199
instead of risking lives by
migrating to another planet.

201
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:42,952
It feels like these
passionate applicants

202
00:11:42,953 --> 00:11:45,037
are already off in space.

203
00:11:45,038 --> 00:11:47,290
More importantly,
this is the expedition

204
00:11:47,291 --> 00:11:50,502
led by former congressman,
Kenneth Marshall,

205
00:11:50,627 --> 00:11:53,462
who lost his last two elections.

206
00:11:53,463 --> 00:11:55,173
Is this failed politician

207
00:11:55,174 --> 00:11:58,843
now trying to establish a
kingdom beyond the stars?

208
00:11:58,844 --> 00:12:01,345
Is it his fanatical supporters

209
00:12:01,346 --> 00:12:03,264
who won him a
generous sponsorship

210
00:12:03,265 --> 00:12:06,976
from a particular religious
organization and corporation?

211
00:12:06,977 --> 00:12:09,395
So many questions
left unanswered.

212
00:12:09,396 --> 00:12:11,147
Let's go and talk to the crowd.

213
00:12:11,148 --> 00:12:14,233
Excuse me, are you a
Kenneth Marshall supporter?

214
00:12:14,234 --> 00:12:16,152
I am. I am, big time.

215
00:12:16,153 --> 00:12:17,862
I am a full-on supporter.

216
00:12:17,863 --> 00:12:19,906
I basically am the one and only.

217
00:12:19,907 --> 00:12:21,908
Are you from M-Marshall's
official channel?

218
00:12:21,909 --> 00:12:23,743
- I'm from EC 20...
- No way.

219
00:12:23,744 --> 00:12:25,620
So Marshall's watching
this right now?

220

- Oh, my God!
- You need to pick me.

221
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:29,291
I swear, please pick me.

222
00:12:29,708 --> 00:12:32,461

00:12:47,726 --> 00:12:48,768
but they're wrong, I promise.

229
00:12:48,769 --> 00:12:52,355
I can fix toilets. I make gingerbread.
You gotta take me, give me a shot.

up with to pull that off,</i>

246

Yes.

You read it, so you know, right?

259
00:14:16,899 --> 00:14:19,442
This is gonna be a
pretty extreme job.

260
00:14:19,443 --> 00:14:21,862
But it's also gonna be fun.

00:14:22,571 --> 00:14:24,488
I'll explain all the details.

00:14:24,489 --> 00:14:27,825
[Mickey 17, VO] <i>I got so
distracted by that smell, uh,</i>

<i>It was like it brought back some
far away memory, or something.</i>

265

That giant tank downstairs
is called a cycler.

266
00:14:38,337 --> 00:14:41,756
It takes organic waste
produced in the spaceship,

apple peels, chicken
bones, rotten eggs,

dead bodies, human
waste, you name it...

269
00:14:47,429 --> 00:14:50,932
then it combines,
refines, and recycles them

270
00:14:50,933 --> 00:14:55,019
and sends a portion
to this printer.

271
00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:57,397
Raw materials for a human body.

your body within 20 hours.

off, change into this.

We're going to do a full
scan of your biodata.

279

That means you'll be reprinted
exactly as you are right now.

281
00:15:31,181 --> 00:15:33,683

All right, enough. Enough.

343
00:20:21,388 --> 00:20:24,932
Keep that up for one minute
and you waste five calories.

344
00:20:24,933 --> 00:20:28,854
That's two percent of the precious
meal you're eating right now.

number one priority</i>

347

<i>so that we maximize
our survival rate.</i>

348
00:20:38,155 --> 00:20:39,740
So, listen up.

349
00:20:40,324 --> 00:20:42,742
Sexual intercourse, for example.

350
00:20:42,743 --> 00:20:43,951
- Each...
- Session.

351
00:20:43,952 --> 00:20:47,580
...session consumes a
whopping 100 calories.

352
00:20:47,581 --> 00:20:49,457
- At least.
- At least.

353
00:20:49,458 --> 00:20:51,835
Depending on the participants,

355
00:20:54,588 --> 00:20:56,923
The point is, Kenneth is
talking to the Committee

356
00:20:56,924 --> 00:20:59,800
about banning all sexual
activity on the ship.

357
00:20:59,801 --> 00:21:00,968
[woman] What?

358
00:21:00,969 --> 00:21:02,529
Well, I don't have
a problem with that.

Darling, are you sure this is
the right time to bring that up?

361
00:21:11,939 --> 00:21:14,608
Honey, I'm sorry. I was
just trying to help you.

362
00:21:17,236 --> 00:21:19,237
No. It's okay.

363
00:21:19,238 --> 00:21:22,073
Am I doing okay?
Should I go harder?

364
00:21:22,074 --> 00:21:24,659
- Yes! Yes, go hard.
- All right.

Fellow pioneers,

367
00:21:28,622 --> 00:21:30,790
once we've arrived in Niflheim

368
00:21:30,791 --> 00:21:33,125
and we've secured
our food production,

369
00:21:33,126 --> 00:21:35,003
we will launch the greatest

370

[Nasha laughs]

373
00:21:43,595 --> 00:21:48,641
You will spread your

- [gasping]
- [cheering echoes]

375
00:21:52,312 --> 00:21:55,648
First we survive!
Then we thrive!

376
00:21:55,649 --> 00:21:58,110
Then we go forth and multiply!

377
00:21:58,485 --> 00:22:00,236
Propagate the species!

378
00:22:00,237 --> 00:22:02,738
We shall infest the land!

379

Marshall! Marshall!

380
00:22:07,619 --> 00:22:09,704
[Mickey 17, VO] <i>And so

And then, unfortunately,
this is...

385
00:22:22,009 --> 00:22:23,467
[Nasha] Yeah. And
now do this bit.

386
00:22:23,468 --> 00:22:25,219
[Mickey] Ooh.

387
00:22:25,220 --> 00:22:27,763

[Timo] What is that?

848
00:46:54,690 --> 00:46:57,108
[man sighs] I feel it.

849
00:46:57,109 --> 00:46:58,484
[Timo] What are you doing?

850
00:46:58,485 --> 00:47:01,321
That's not a thing. Open it.

851
00:47:02,155 --> 00:47:04,241
Should we just kill
that son of a bitch?

852
00:47:04,867 --> 00:47:06,367
- [man] I was just joking around.
- What?

853
00:47:06,368 --> 00:47:11,039
Don't act surprised. Your
memories are my memories.

854
00:47:11,164 --> 00:47:13,207
The money he blew.

855
00:47:13,208 --> 00:47:16,461
That bastard put most of
the loans under our name.

856
00:47:16,587 --> 00:47:19,882
In Darius Blank's ledger,
we're the ones on the hook.

857
00:47:20,507 --> 00:47:22,467
That needs fact checking.

858
00:47:22,885 --> 00:47:25,303
- [Timo] Have fun, man.
- [footsteps recede]

859
00:47:25,304 --> 00:47:26,637
Let's kill him.

860
00:47:26,638 --> 00:47:31,267
Are you crazy? He-He's,
like, my only friend.

861
00:47:31,268 --> 00:47:34,228
Friend? Same orphanage
doesn't mean shit.

862
00:47:34,229 --> 00:47:35,271
Wait, wait.

863
00:47:35,272 --> 00:47:37,190
[whistling]

864
00:47:37,191 --> 00:47:39,317
[chuckles] Timo.

865
00:47:39,318 --> 00:47:40,611
Mickey, what...?

866
00:47:41,195 --> 00:47:43,112
Looks like business
is blowing up, huh?

867
00:47:43,113 --> 00:47:44,656
What're you talking about?

868
00:47:45,532 --> 00:47:47,618
Another junky coming
in. [chuckles]

869
00:47:47,743 --> 00:47:49,745
[grunting]

870
00:47:50,704 --> 00:47:53,207
- [Timo screams]
- [Mickey 18 grunting]

871
00:47:59,713 --> 00:48:00,713
[Mickey 17] Timo!

872
00:48:02,591 --> 00:48:04,800
Hey! Are you mental? [grunting]

873
00:48:04,801 --> 00:48:06,469
Wait until I get out of
here. I'm gonna kill you!

874
00:48:06,470 --> 00:48:08,639
The fuck is this? [grunts]

875
00:48:09,348 --> 00:48:11,766
Come down lower!
You fucking idiot.

876
00:48:11,767 --> 00:48:12,934
[grunts]

877
00:48:12,935 --> 00:48:15,979
- [Timo grunts]
- [grunting]

878
00:48:22,069 --> 00:48:24,780
- [gasping]
- [metal clanking]

879
00:48:27,449 --> 00:48:28,450
[Timo] Okay.

880
00:48:29,368 --> 00:48:32,078
- Okay. Come on.
- [metal scrapes]

881
00:48:32,079 --> 00:48:35,457
Mickey, help me. [panting]

882
00:48:38,168 --> 00:48:40,879
What is that? Why is it
so red? That looks hot.

883
00:48:41,797 --> 00:48:43,089
What are you doing?

884
00:48:43,090 --> 00:48:45,133
[Mickey 18] I want you
to have a go at dying,

885
00:48:45,425 --> 00:48:46,968
you son of a bitch.

886
00:48:46,969 --> 00:48:49,345
- [Timo] What?
- [sizzling]

887
00:48:49,346 --> 00:48:50,429
Come on!

888
00:48:50,430 --> 00:48:52,390
[gasps]

889
00:48:52,391 --> 00:48:54,309
Stop. Stop!

890
00:48:54,560 --> 00:48:57,813
[shushes]

891
00:49:02,276 --> 00:49:04,736
[metal banging]

892
00:49:06,655 --> 00:49:07,822
- [Mickey 17 gasps]
- [man] Oh.

893
00:49:07,823 --> 00:49:10,534
Is that Mickey? Hey,
what's going on?

894
00:49:11,535 --> 00:49:13,120
[Nasha] Mickey, what
are you doing here?

895
00:49:13,620 --> 00:49:18,417
Uh, Timo accidentally fell in,
but, uh, he's all right now.

896
00:49:19,293 --> 00:49:21,086
You wanna keep
dealing, motherfucker?

897
00:49:21,211 --> 00:49:22,379
Watch what you say.

898
00:49:25,299 --> 00:49:27,091
[gasps, groans]

899
00:49:27,092 --> 00:49:29,511
What happened? You okay?

900
00:49:31,096 --> 00:49:32,471
What's up with your hand?

901
00:49:32,472 --> 00:49:34,599
[Timo groans]

902
00:49:34,600 --> 00:49:38,686
Just taking out the trash,
and I tripped into the hole.

903
00:49:38,687 --> 00:49:40,146
I would've been a goner
if not for Mickey.

904
00:49:40,147 --> 00:49:42,815
I almost became cycler
dust. [chuckles]

905
00:49:42,816 --> 00:49:43,942
[Nasha] Hey.

906
00:49:44,276 --> 00:49:45,902
You all right?

907
00:49:45,903 --> 00:49:49,071
Told you to stay in bed. It's only been
a few hours since you were printed.

908
00:49:49,072 --> 00:49:50,615
[Mickey 18] Yeah,
I should've done.

909
00:49:50,616 --> 00:49:52,492
- [man] You heard the rumors?
- Huh?

910
00:49:52,951 --> 00:49:56,078
Some guy out there is
dealing undiluted Oxyzofol.

911
00:49:56,079 --> 00:49:59,248
What? That's crazy.
That's pretty messed up.

912
00:49:59,249 --> 00:50:01,042
Between us, Timo,

913
00:50:01,043 --> 00:50:04,338
a drop here and there before bed
to take the edge off, I get it.

914
00:50:04,463 --> 00:50:06,714
But the pure, uncut stuff
is crossing the line.

915
00:50:06,715 --> 00:50:10,176
Oh, yeah, absolutely.
That's bad.

916
00:50:10,177 --> 00:50:12,970
Nasha, take Mickey
home. I'll wrap up here.

917
00:50:12,971 --> 00:50:15,432
Yes. Thank you. I'll
see you tomorrow.

918
00:50:24,983 --> 00:50:27,194
[scoffs]

919
00:50:30,989 --> 00:50:33,909
Well, today I feel like B6.

920
00:50:35,285 --> 00:50:37,161
- B6?
- Yes. [giggles]

921
00:50:37,162 --> 00:50:39,789
- Flying Nasha?
- [imitates bird, laughs]

922
00:50:39,790 --> 00:50:41,916
It's definitely the
right place for that one.

923
00:50:41,917 --> 00:50:43,377
[Nasha] What's
going on with you?

924
00:50:44,169 --> 00:50:46,087
[Mickey 18] Mm! [kisses]

925
00:50:46,088 --> 00:50:47,713
[giggling] This isn't like you.

926
00:50:47,714 --> 00:50:50,092
B6? [exhales]

927
00:50:51,051 --> 00:50:53,262
[gasps] B6 was ours, Nasha.

928
00:50:53,929 --> 00:50:55,556
[Nasha laughing]

929
00:51:01,687 --> 00:51:02,813
- Mickey?
- [gasps]

930
00:51:03,605 --> 00:51:04,897
Hey, brother.

931
00:51:04,898 --> 00:51:06,899
I was just headed to your room
to get you, but here you are.

932
00:51:06,900 --> 00:51:08,359
[pigeon man] Looking
good, Mickey.

933
00:51:08,360 --> 00:51:09,862
Yes, sir. Okay.

934
00:51:10,612 --> 00:51:12,530
You stand there.
Arm around, please.

935
00:51:12,531 --> 00:51:15,741
Great. Good. Uh, big
smile, Mickey, would you?

936
00:51:15,742 --> 00:51:17,076
- Hold that.
- Yeah, big smile. Great.

937
00:51:17,077 --> 00:51:19,829
Sorry. Could you just
stand... Great, thank you.

938
00:51:19,830 --> 00:51:22,373
Okay, and action.

939
00:51:22,374 --> 00:51:24,458
Congratulations.

940
00:51:24,459 --> 00:51:27,462
This month's lucky
winner, the fortunate soul

941
00:51:27,588 --> 00:51:29,422
who'll have the privilege
of a private dinner...

942
00:51:29,423 --> 00:51:31,257
At the camera... who'll
have a private dinner

943
00:51:31,258 --> 00:51:34,093
with the one and only
Kenneth Marshall is...

944
00:51:34,094 --> 00:51:35,553
- Down the barrel.
- [grunts]

945
00:51:35,554 --> 00:51:36,929
- It's Mickey.
- [exhales]

946
00:51:36,930 --> 00:51:38,556
Great. Big smile.

947
00:51:38,557 --> 00:51:39,640
- Smile.
- [exhales]

948
00:51:39,641 --> 00:51:41,809
There. Amazing. Okay, cut.

949
00:51:41,810 --> 00:51:44,020
Now, Marshall wants
you to come ASAP, okay?

950
00:51:44,021 --> 00:51:46,314
He's got a whole feast
prepared just for you.

951
00:51:46,315 --> 00:51:48,983
The Lord is truly blessing
you today, Mickey.

952
00:51:48,984 --> 00:51:51,402
First, I need to
go back to my room.

953
00:51:51,403 --> 00:51:53,530
You get to stuff your
fucking face, Mickey.

954
00:51:55,782 --> 00:51:58,826
[Mickey 17, VO] <i>I bet that
freak is probably drooling</i>

955
00:51:58,827 --> 00:52:01,037
<i>all over my beautiful
Nasha already.</i>

956
00:52:01,038 --> 00:52:03,332
<i>It's disgusting.</i> [gasping]

957
00:52:03,457 --> 00:52:05,374
<i>What's even more disgusting
is that I'm drooling</i>

958
00:52:05,375 --> 00:52:07,085
<i>at the thought of
the tenderloin steak</i>

959
00:52:07,211 --> 00:52:08,837
<i>I ordered for Marshall's dinner.</i>

960
00:52:10,797 --> 00:52:12,549
<i>This is so wrong!</i>

961
00:52:13,008 --> 00:52:14,926
[Ylfa] So glad you
seem to be enjoying it.

962
00:52:14,927 --> 00:52:17,262
- [Ylfa, Marshall chuckle]
- [Ylfa] How's the sauce?

963
00:52:20,307 --> 00:52:21,891
Oh. [muffled speech]

964
00:52:21,892 --> 00:52:24,560
Oh, sorry, sorry.
[chuckles] Please, continue.

965
00:52:24,561 --> 00:52:26,480
Yeah, yeah, Mickey. Uh...

966
00:52:27,189 --> 00:52:31,026
Listen, going back to everything
that happened with, uh...

967
00:52:31,818 --> 00:52:32,860
Jennifer.

968
00:52:32,861 --> 00:52:34,905
Yes, Jennifer.

969
00:52:35,739 --> 00:52:36,948
Jennifer...

970
00:52:36,949 --> 00:52:38,074
Chilton.

971
00:52:38,075 --> 00:52:39,826
I know, I know. [chuckles]

972
00:52:40,244 --> 00:52:43,496
When we lost our dear
Jennifer Chilton,

973
00:52:43,497 --> 00:52:48,919
I may have gotten a little angry and
said some terribly unkind things.

974
00:52:49,044 --> 00:52:52,381
I know it's late, and
I want to apologize.

975
00:52:52,506 --> 00:52:54,715
[chuckles] He's
always like this.

976
00:52:54,716 --> 00:52:57,718
Such an adorable man and then
suddenly he's all cutthroat.

977
00:52:57,719 --> 00:52:59,679
[chuckles]

978
00:52:59,680 --> 00:53:02,182
[whispers] Darling, I'm
trying to make it here. Okay?

979
00:53:02,850 --> 00:53:06,477
Sorry. You're still squishy,
fresh out of the printer.

980
00:53:06,478 --> 00:53:08,145
Continue feeding yourself.

981
00:53:08,146 --> 00:53:10,022
[door whooshes]

982
00:53:10,023 --> 00:53:13,317
Oh. Anyway, we have
another special guest here.

983
00:53:13,318 --> 00:53:14,444
Hi, Kai.

984
00:53:14,945 --> 00:53:16,487
Sorry, I'm late.

985
00:53:16,488 --> 00:53:18,739
- [Marshall] You look very nice.
- Thank you.

986
00:53:18,740 --> 00:53:19,824
[Marshall] Come. Come.

987
00:53:19,825 --> 00:53:21,705
- [Ylfa] It's good to see you.
- [Marshall] Sit.

988
00:53:24,079 --> 00:53:26,373
You okay? Emotionally?

989
00:53:26,832 --> 00:53:29,167
Yeah, I feel fine,
sir. Thank you.

990
00:53:29,168 --> 00:53:32,713
I'm glad to hear it, Kai.
I'm so sorry about Jennifer.

991
00:53:32,838 --> 00:53:36,465
I hear you were extremely
close. Your best friend.

992
00:53:36,466 --> 00:53:38,718
[whispers] But I knew you'd
stay strong throughout it all.

993
00:53:38,719 --> 00:53:40,469
Thank you, ma'am.

994
00:53:40,470 --> 00:53:43,891
But we didn't invite you
here simply to comfort you.

995
00:53:45,392 --> 00:53:47,603
We've had our eyes on you, Katz.

996
00:53:47,936 --> 00:53:49,770
- On me, sir?
- [Marshall] Mmm.

997
00:53:49,771 --> 00:53:51,856
May I ask why?

998
00:53:51,857 --> 00:53:53,734
You're one of us.

999
00:53:55,819 --> 00:53:57,613
With your impeccable genetics,

1000
00:53:57,738 --> 00:54:01,115
you are the perfect specimen
for the colony I envision.

1001
00:54:01,116 --> 00:54:03,202
[chuckles]

1002
00:54:03,744 --> 00:54:05,286
Well, thank you, sir.

1003
00:54:05,287 --> 00:54:08,915
That's why the church,
I mean, um, company,

1004
00:54:08,916 --> 00:54:12,044
has chosen me to
lead this expedition.

1005
00:54:12,169 --> 00:54:15,339
The Earth's beyond saving
with all its muddy people.

1006
00:54:16,006 --> 00:54:18,466
But you, you're
something special,

1007
00:54:18,467 --> 00:54:21,135
and I'm creating a world

1008
00:54:21,136 --> 00:54:24,013
on a pure white planet
full of superior people.

1009
00:54:24,014 --> 00:54:26,933
Like you. And us. Isn't
that right, darling?

1010
00:54:26,934 --> 00:54:29,852
- Yes. Mmm. It's his vision.
- My vision.

1011
00:54:29,853 --> 00:54:31,562
- His sensibilities.
- Sensibility.

1012
00:54:31,563 --> 00:54:34,607
But let's be honest, with
your medical records in hand,

1013
00:54:34,608 --> 00:54:36,984
you ran to join our expedition

1014
00:54:36,985 --> 00:54:39,112
instead of one of
those pathetic planets

1015
00:54:39,238 --> 00:54:41,197
where they plant microchips

1016
00:54:41,198 --> 00:54:43,741
in their artificially
inseminated baby embryos.

1017
00:54:43,742 --> 00:54:45,409
You really are the
perfect candidate

1018
00:54:45,410 --> 00:54:47,787
for Niflheim's natural
child birthing program,

1019
00:54:47,788 --> 00:54:50,498
- aren't you, dear?
- [scoffs]

1020
00:54:50,499 --> 00:54:54,002
Mr. Marshall, am I
just a uterus to you?

1021
00:54:57,089 --> 00:55:01,551
No! No, no, no. [chuckles]
It's nothing like that, Kai.

1022
00:55:01,552 --> 00:55:04,387
No, this man is not
one to objectify women.

1023
00:55:04,388 --> 00:55:08,391
All my husband means to say
is he has very high standards.

1024
00:55:08,392 --> 00:55:11,185
His only dream is of
a planet exclusively

1025
00:55:11,186 --> 00:55:12,895
for a pure human race.

1026
00:55:12,896 --> 00:55:16,774
That consumes real
crops, and real meat,

1027
00:55:16,775 --> 00:55:20,403
and dinners with delicate,
delicious sauces.

1028
00:55:20,404 --> 00:55:24,156
Oh, sauce is the true
litmus test of civilization.

1029
00:55:24,157 --> 00:55:26,659
People who devour burnt
meat are barbarians.

1030
00:55:26,660 --> 00:55:29,579
Do try the sauce, Kai.
Here, I made it myself.

1031
00:55:29,580 --> 00:55:31,081
Oh. Thank you.

1032
00:55:33,750 --> 00:55:37,212
But first, I'd like to say a
few words in Jennifer's memory.

1033
00:55:38,672 --> 00:55:39,630
A prayer.

1034
00:55:39,631 --> 00:55:41,717
Always ready for a prayer.

1035
00:55:43,051 --> 00:55:45,511
Jennifer, when I first
met you at the cafeteria

1036
00:55:45,512 --> 00:55:47,014
four years ago...

1037
00:55:54,438 --> 00:55:55,981
[sniffles]

1038
00:55:57,024 --> 00:55:58,567
You were...

1039
00:56:00,694 --> 00:56:02,446
Dear Lord...

1040
00:56:02,905 --> 00:56:05,532
Jennifer Chilton's
one and only soul

1041
00:56:06,700 --> 00:56:09,703
was taken from her
wonderful friend, Kai.

1042
00:56:11,079 --> 00:56:12,497
Dear Lord...

1043
00:56:13,207 --> 00:56:16,709

[Mickey 17 gasping]

1056
00:57:04,007 --> 00:57:06,717
Apologies, sir. This
is embarrassing.

1057
00:57:06,718 --> 00:57:08,344
The cultured meat
that he just ate

1058
00:57:08,345 --> 00:57:10,680
includes an experimental
growth hormone.

1059
00:57:10,681 --> 00:57:14,225
Obviously, it's still risky.
I'm so very sorry, sir.

1060
00:57:14,226 --> 00:57:15,309
[gasping continues]

1061
00:57:15,310 --> 00:57:17,270
You're sure it's not because
he was eating so much?

1062
00:57:17,271 --> 00:57:19,939
He was stuffing his
friggin' pie hole.

1063
00:57:19,940 --> 00:57:22,608
No, not quite, sir. You see
the red rash on his neck.

1064
00:57:22,609 --> 00:57:24,819
It's a side effect of
the growth hormone.

1065
00:57:24,820 --> 00:57:26,821
- Ah.
- [Arkady] I'm so ashamed.

1066
00:57:26,822 --> 00:57:31,200
I take full responsibility and
resign my position immediately.

1067
00:57:31,201 --> 00:57:35,997
No, no, no, not at all. I
mean, artificial meat is crap.

1068
00:57:35,998 --> 00:57:37,498
How are we supposed
to improve it

1069
00:57:37,499 --> 00:57:40,210
unless we fail
upward to perfection?

1070
00:57:40,335 --> 00:57:41,961
- No. Arkady...
- [Mickey 17 gasping]

1071
00:57:41,962 --> 00:57:45,090
...stand tall in your
failures like me, my friend.

1072
00:57:46,341 --> 00:57:48,093
Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.

1073
00:57:48,468 --> 00:57:49,468
[Kai] Commander.

1074
00:57:49,469 --> 00:57:52,346
So you are testing out your
in-flight TV dinner on him?

1075
00:57:52,347 --> 00:57:53,764
In-flight TV dinner?

1076
00:57:53,765 --> 00:57:55,141
[Mickey 17 screaming]

1077
00:57:55,142 --> 00:57:57,895
Is that what the young
troops are calling it now?

1078
00:57:58,604 --> 00:57:59,687
Excuse me.

1079
00:57:59,688 --> 00:58:01,981
[Mickey 17 screaming, grunting]

1080
00:58:01,982 --> 00:58:03,649
Are you in a lot of pain?

1081
00:58:03,650 --> 00:58:06,027
[grunts] I'm being
punished. [gasping]

1082
00:58:06,028 --> 00:58:08,863
- What?
- [Mickey 17] It's my punishment.

1083
00:58:08,864 --> 00:58:12,159
I should've gone to
Nasha and not come here.

1084
00:58:12,659 --> 00:58:15,661
- [scoffs]
- [Mickey 17 groans]

1085
00:58:15,662 --> 00:58:16,662
Ew.

1086
00:58:17,539 --> 00:58:19,499
Dorothy, bring me Purple Joe.

1087
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:21,668
Sir, you remember the
special painkiller

1088
00:58:21,835 --> 00:58:22,960
- we've been developing?
- [grunting]

1089
00:58:22,961 --> 00:58:24,337
Yeah, Purple Joe.

1090
00:58:24,338 --> 00:58:26,380
It's a quick fix for
injured agents, right?

1091
00:58:26,381 --> 00:58:29,342
Yeah. Since Mickey here
is in such awful pain,

1092
00:58:29,343 --> 00:58:31,886
it's a perfect opportunity
to try a little test, so...

1093
00:58:31,887 --> 00:58:33,597
- Give it to him.
- Great, all right.

1094
00:58:34,431 --> 00:58:36,474
[gasping]

1095
00:58:36,475 --> 00:58:37,768
[quiets]

1096
00:58:42,981 --> 00:58:44,816
[Arkady] Come on, Purple Joe.

1097
00:58:46,777 --> 00:58:48,654
[whispers] Okay, here we go.

1098
00:58:50,364 --> 00:58:52,406
- [bangs table]
- [groans]

1099
00:58:52,407 --> 00:58:54,116
Don't touch him, please.

1100
00:58:54,117 --> 00:58:56,494
- Mickey, can you see me?
- [grunting]

1101
00:58:56,495 --> 00:58:58,829
Mickey? Mickey!

1102
00:58:58,830 --> 00:59:01,083
- [man] Oh, sorry.
- Get back down there.

1103
00:59:01,875 --> 00:59:03,645
- [Dorothy] Mickey? Mickey?
- [glasses clattering]

1104
00:59:03,669 --> 00:59:05,086
[Ylfa] Oh, God. Oh, God.

- Oh, my God.
- Oh.

[continues shouting]

1109
00:59:14,221 --> 00:59:15,972
Oh. What do we do?

1110
00:59:15,973 --> 00:59:18,684
[shouting continues]

1111

[screams]

1112
00:59:21,270 --> 00:59:23,729
Apologies, sir. The
painkiller's not working.

1113
00:59:23,730 --> 00:59:25,189
Oh.

1114
00:59:25,190 --> 00:59:27,276
[groaning]

1115
00:59:29,736 --> 00:59:32,697
[Arkady] Don't film this,
Preston. Please, turn it off.

[Marshall] This is better,
right? More humane.

1118
00:59:36,201 --> 00:59:37,285
[Arkady] Yes, sir. More humane.

1119
00:59:37,286 --> 00:59:39,955
- No, no, no. What are you doing?
- Huh?

1120
00:59:40,539 --> 00:59:42,373
You can't tear a hole
in my fucking carpet.

1121
00:59:42,374 --> 00:59:43,291
[gasping]

1122
00:59:43,292 --> 00:59:45,169
Well, we'll just shoot
him from the side.

1123
00:59:45,294 --> 00:59:47,086
But what about the blood?

1124
00:59:47,087 --> 00:59:49,797
This is a Persian Tabriz!

1125
00:59:49,798 --> 00:59:51,299
Honey, calm down.

1126
00:59:51,300 --> 00:59:52,300
Shoot now.

1127
00:59:52,718 --> 00:59:54,552
What the hell is going on?

1128
00:59:54,553 --> 00:59:57,389
This was supposed to
be a fucking dinner!

1129
00:59:58,015 --> 00:59:59,391
He's your guest.

1130
00:59:59,933 --> 01:00:02,810
Agent Kai Katz, what the
hell's going on with you?

1131
01:00:02,811 --> 01:00:06,063
He's a meat matrix. He's
a goddamn print job.

1132
01:00:06,064 --> 01:00:07,482
An Expendable.

1133
01:00:07,900 --> 01:00:09,859
He signed up for this.

1134
01:00:09,860 --> 01:00:11,069
Yes, sir.

1135
01:00:11,486 --> 01:00:13,070
[Marshall] This is
for our planet, agent.

1136
01:00:13,071 --> 01:00:14,614
I'm sorry, sir.

1137
01:00:14,615 --> 01:00:15,865
[Mickey 17] Commander.

1138
01:00:15,866 --> 01:00:17,575
[panting]

1139
01:00:17,576 --> 01:00:20,704
Please don't shoot.

1140
01:00:22,998 --> 01:00:24,416
I'm okay now.

1141
01:00:25,375 --> 01:00:26,668
[Marshall] I don't think so.

1142
01:00:27,503 --> 01:00:29,629
He still seems like
he's in a lot of pain.

1143
01:00:29,630 --> 01:00:31,298
Of course he is.

1144
01:00:33,008 --> 01:00:35,010
[grunting]

1145
01:00:37,638 --> 01:00:39,264
Are you really okay?

1146
01:00:40,641 --> 01:00:43,100
Just... thank you for dinner.

1147
01:00:43,101 --> 01:00:45,145
- [gags]
- [Marshall sighs]

1148
01:00:46,104 --> 01:00:50,233
My room's just there. You need
to clean up and rest, Mickey.

1149
01:00:50,234 --> 01:00:52,068
[panting]

1150
01:00:52,069 --> 01:00:55,404
Don't worry about
me. I can walk.

1151
01:00:55,405 --> 01:00:58,825
I just need to get back to
my room. Nasha's about to...

1152
01:00:59,326 --> 01:01:01,328
Actually, we're going to mine.

1153
01:01:11,046 --> 01:01:12,256
[exhales]

1154
01:01:17,302 --> 01:01:19,346
[Kai] Here. It's dry.

1155
01:01:20,722 --> 01:01:23,641
I drink this whenever
I have a stomach ache.

1156
01:01:23,642 --> 01:01:28,689
It's from Earth. It's precious.
So I've been saving it.

1157
01:01:34,069 --> 01:01:35,904
But I made some for you.

1158
01:01:38,782 --> 01:01:40,576
- Thanks.
- Sit.

1159
01:01:48,542 --> 01:01:53,380
You know, Mickey, I didn't
want to ask you this.

1160
01:01:55,007 --> 01:01:59,761
But just this once,
okay? And I'm so sorry.

1161
01:02:08,312 --> 01:02:12,274
What's it like... dying?

1162
01:02:18,447 --> 01:02:20,157
You asking because of Jennifer?

1163
01:02:22,201 --> 01:02:23,410
Yeah.

1164
01:02:27,080 --> 01:02:31,251
We locked eyes in
the last moment.

1165
01:02:35,422 --> 01:02:40,427
What did she feel as all that
ice came crashing down on her?

1166
01:02:43,931 --> 01:02:45,933
I can't stop thinking about it.

1167
01:02:50,062 --> 01:02:51,271
Um...

1168
01:02:53,148 --> 01:02:57,069
I don't think it's what I...
what I usually feel. It's...

1169
01:02:58,278 --> 01:03:00,239
Well, I die so often...

1170
01:03:03,492 --> 01:03:06,078
Because you know you're going
to wake up again, right?

1171
01:03:08,330 --> 01:03:10,374
Because you die knowing that.

1172
01:03:15,587 --> 01:03:17,089
No...

1173
01:03:20,509 --> 01:03:22,845
I always feel scared.

1174
01:03:26,139 --> 01:03:31,311
It's terrible, dying. I hate it.

1175
01:03:35,357 --> 01:03:40,654
No matter how many times I
go through it, it's scary.

1176
01:03:42,990 --> 01:03:46,827
Still. Always, every time.

1177
01:03:51,415 --> 01:03:53,083
But you're here.

1178
01:03:56,170 --> 01:03:57,754
And Jennifer isn't.

1179
01:04:00,841 --> 01:04:02,134
Out there.

1180
01:04:03,969 --> 01:04:05,679
The entire universe.

1181
01:04:09,558 --> 01:04:11,059
She's nowhere.

1182
01:04:28,577 --> 01:04:30,913
You don't look like
you were printed out.

1183
01:04:37,002 --> 01:04:39,004
You're just a person.

1184
01:04:45,010 --> 01:04:47,179
Are you and Nasha open?

1185
01:04:49,431 --> 01:04:51,225
I have to go.

1186
01:04:53,435 --> 01:04:55,896
Nasha, please forgive me.

1187
01:04:56,688 --> 01:04:59,732
The guy that you're

01:14:35,684 --> 01:14:36,684
- Exquisite.
- [cheering]

1359
01:14:36,685 --> 01:14:38,936
This is where our
names will be etched.

1360
01:14:38,937 --> 01:14:42,231
Mine and yours. And you!

1361
01:14:42,232 --> 01:14:46,236
- [cheers and applause]
- And you! And you! And you!

1362
01:14:47,029 --> 01:14:49,406
And you, my beautiful Ylfa.

1363
01:14:50,616 --> 01:14:53,659
Almost every single one of you

1364
01:14:53,660 --> 01:14:56,120
will be remembered
throughout history

1365
01:14:56,121 --> 01:15:01,083
as the proud founders of
Niflheim's first generation.

1366
01:15:01,084 --> 01:15:03,045
- Yes!
- [cheering]

1367
01:15:03,462 --> 01:15:07,507
- Our cornerstone black diamond.
- [hooting]

1368
01:15:07,508 --> 01:15:09,926
Beautiful, shimmering purity.

1369
01:15:09,927 --> 01:15:14,305
This rock will become the
symbolic monument of Niflheim,

1370
01:15:14,306 --> 01:15:17,183
the one and only
pure colony planet.

1371
01:15:17,184 --> 01:15:18,392
- The one and only...
- One and only.

1372
01:15:18,393 --> 01:15:19,310
Niflheim!

1373
01:15:19,311 --> 01:15:20,520
[together] The one and only

1374
01:15:20,521 --> 01:15:21,437
Niflheim.

1375
01:15:21,438 --> 01:15:24,483
The one and only!

1380

[Preston] No, don't
touch it, sir.

1381
01:16:10,946 --> 01:16:11,988
Maybe it's contagious.

1382
01:16:11,989 --> 01:16:13,656
[Marshall] It's contagious!

1383
01:16:13,657 --> 01:16:14,991
[scattered screaming]

1384
01:16:14,992 --> 01:16:16,994

- Everyone run!

01:16:20,122 --> 01:16:21,707
- Stop! Stop!
- Mickey!

1387
01:16:22,124 --> 01:16:23,709
- Stop! Go back!
- Mickey!

1388
01:16:24,293 --> 01:16:26,795
Seal the exit!
Isolate the chamber!

1389
01:16:26,920 --> 01:16:29,798

[Marshall] Stay
calm, God damn it.

1392
01:16:32,801 --> 01:16:34,178
Sterilization.

1393
01:16:37,723 --> 01:16:40,892
Initiate stage one. Agents!

1394
01:16:40,893 --> 01:16:42,894
Into your hazmat suit!

1395
01:16:42,895 --> 01:16:43,978
- Arkady.
- [Arkady] Yes!

1396
01:16:43,979 --> 01:16:45,606
- Move your ass.
- [Arkady] Okay!

1397
01:16:50,527 --> 01:16:51,861
[Marshall] Capture it!

1398
01:16:51,862 --> 01:16:53,405
Capture it alive!

1399
01:16:57,117 --> 01:16:59,453
It's here! It's here! That's it!

1400
01:16:59,912 --> 01:17:01,245
- That's it.
- [chittering]

1401
01:17:01,246 --> 01:17:03,581
Get it, get it, get it.

1402

Get... Get... God damn it!

1403
01:17:07,085 --> 01:17:10,922
Hey, Expendable, you
don't need a hazmat suit.

1404
01:17:10,923 --> 01:17:12,799
Catch the goddamn thing!

Grab it!

1409
01:17:32,027 --> 01:17:33,027
Mickey!

1410
01:17:35,864 --> 01:17:37,157
Where's the other Mickey?

1411
01:17:37,658 --> 01:17:39,575
[grunts] I don't know!

1412
01:17:39,576 --> 01:17:41,827
Mickey, in here!
In here. Come on!

1413
01:17:41,828 --> 01:17:44,830

Multiples.

1419
01:17:59,137 --> 01:18:01,514
[Nasha] Don't shoot. I've
got him under control.

1420
01:18:01,515 --> 01:18:02,933
Don't shoot.

1421
01:18:03,725 --> 01:18:06,687
[Marshall] Yes. Calm
down. Calm down.

1422
01:18:07,187 --> 01:18:09,397
We have everything
under control.

1423
01:18:09,398 --> 01:18:12,317
[Preston] You rock,
Marshall! Bravo!

1424
01:18:13,193 --> 01:18:19,407
Those lowlife Multiples have
ruined our precious symbol of...

Tell the Committee you
were aiming at the creeper

1442
01:19:20,260 --> 01:19:21,261
behind Marshall.

1443
01:19:22,012 --> 01:19:23,972
Otherwise, you could
get permanently deleted.

1444
01:19:24,097 --> 01:19:26,934
[sighs] Fuck that shit.

1445
01:19:28,227 --> 01:19:31,063
You really think Captain
Creampie's gonna let us live?

1446
01:19:33,690 --> 01:19:35,191
He's probably gonna
shoot us himself.

1447
01:19:35,192 --> 01:19:37,444
[sighs] He's a nutjob.

1448
01:19:38,111 --> 01:19:39,738
Doesn't listen to anybody.

1449
01:19:40,489 --> 01:19:43,407
He's the biggest, dumbest
nutjob out of all the Mickeys.

1450
01:19:43,408 --> 01:19:45,118
And that's saying something.

1451
01:19:46,119 --> 01:19:48,746
[scoffs] He screwed
my entire life up.

1452
01:19:48,747 --> 01:19:50,039
[Mickey 18] Oh, really?

1453
01:19:50,040 --> 01:19:52,667
We all got fucked the minute
you decided not to die

1454
01:19:52,668 --> 01:19:55,003
and came crawling home to mummy.

1455
01:19:55,128 --> 01:19:58,090
That wasn't my fault. That
was a creeper's fault.

1456
01:19:59,508 --> 01:20:00,509
Creeper?

1457
01:20:01,134 --> 01:20:04,262
Well, if that creeper's eaten
me like it was supposed to,

1458
01:20:04,263 --> 01:20:06,264
then we wouldn't be
in this situation,

1459
01:20:06,265 --> 01:20:08,684
but they all kicked me out

1460
01:20:09,434 --> 01:20:11,103
and now I'm a goddamn Multiple.

1461
01:20:11,728 --> 01:20:12,895
They kicked you out?

1462
01:20:12,896 --> 01:20:13,897
Yeah.

1463
01:20:14,815 --> 01:20:17,400
They were all pushing
me and pulling me,

1464
01:20:17,401 --> 01:20:21,029
and I mean, they all threw
me back into the snow.

1465
01:20:22,489 --> 01:20:26,450
Maybe I don't look tasty
enough or I smell off.

1466
01:20:26,451 --> 01:20:27,870
I don't know.

1467
01:20:29,162 --> 01:20:31,081
Maybe if I was in
some kind of sauce.

1468
01:20:31,748 --> 01:20:32,916
[Nasha] Hold on.

1469
01:20:34,626 --> 01:20:36,670
You're telling me
they saved you?

1470
01:20:37,796 --> 01:20:39,089
Think about it.

1471
01:20:39,506 --> 01:20:41,883
You should have died
in that crevasse.

1472
01:20:41,884 --> 01:20:43,802
The creepers saved you.

1473
01:20:44,803 --> 01:20:47,097
Uh, yeah, I guess if
you put it like that...

1474
01:20:50,058 --> 01:20:52,019
<i>they were sorta seeing me off.</i>

1475
01:20:53,187 --> 01:20:55,229
Maybe I should have
said thank you.

1476
01:20:55,230 --> 01:20:56,440
Yeah.

1477
01:20:57,024 --> 01:20:59,442
I don't think they
were gonna eat you.

1478
01:20:59,443 --> 01:21:01,445
- Right?
- [chuckles]

1479
01:21:01,987 --> 01:21:04,155
[Nasha] Oh, my God. [chuckles]

1480
01:21:04,156 --> 01:21:06,908
We have to report this to
Science. They save humans.

1481
01:21:06,909 --> 01:21:09,411
Yeah. People need to know this.

1482
01:21:10,495 --> 01:21:12,206
They saved me.

1483
01:21:13,332 --> 01:21:16,084

- [clanks]

1485
01:21:22,716 --> 01:21:25,134
Hey. Where's the fucking ladder?

1486
01:21:25,135 --> 01:21:27,136
You were supposed to
bring a fucking ladder.

1487
01:21:27,137 --> 01:21:28,722
- I don't know...
- [grunting]

1488
01:21:29,640 --> 01:21:31,975
Look, here. Let me help.

1489
01:21:32,518 --> 01:21:35,311
Stop. Stop, stop, stop.
Stop. I'll do it myself.

1490
01:21:35,312 --> 01:21:37,814
I'm coming down myself.
Get the fuck off.

1491
01:21:41,693 --> 01:21:42,527
Come on.

1492
01:21:42,528 --> 01:21:43,654
[Mickey 17] Hey, Timo.

1493
01:21:44,196 --> 01:21:45,196
What are you doing here?

1494
01:21:45,864 --> 01:21:47,032
Oh, wow.

1495
01:21:47,449 --> 01:21:49,700
You two really are
Multiples, huh?

1496
01:21:49,701 --> 01:21:53,538
But it's you. Yeah, I see it
in that schmuck face of yours.

1497
01:21:53,539 --> 01:21:56,374
You're the one who
gave me this. Right?

1498
01:21:56,375 --> 01:21:59,127
- [Mickey 18] Oopsie.
- [scoffs]

1499
01:21:59,503 --> 01:22:02,047
Here you go, guys. You
guys must be starving.

1500
01:22:02,965 --> 01:22:05,092
Thanks, man. I knew
you'd be coming for us.

1501
01:22:05,634 --> 01:22:06,634
[food clatters]

1502
01:22:07,344 --> 01:22:08,637
What are you up to?

1503
01:22:09,555 --> 01:22:10,806
What's all that?

1504
01:22:11,265 --> 01:22:13,392
[Timo sighs] So, um,

1505
01:22:14,351 --> 01:22:15,435
here's the thing.

1506
01:22:16,937 --> 01:22:20,440
I need to shoot a video
and send it to Earth, ASAP.

1507
01:22:20,941 --> 01:22:23,276
Video? To Earth?

1508
01:22:23,277 --> 01:22:24,736
Yeah. Um...

1509
01:22:25,112 --> 01:22:26,613
It's for... [scoffs]

1510
01:22:27,614 --> 01:22:28,615
...Darius Blank.

1511
01:22:29,867 --> 01:22:31,451
Darius Blank. Who's that?

1512
01:22:35,372 --> 01:22:37,958
Found this at my door today.

1513
01:22:38,834 --> 01:22:40,961
It's written by hand.

1514
01:22:41,086 --> 01:22:42,963
It's beautiful handwriting.

1515
01:22:45,924 --> 01:22:47,884
This is from Darius
Blank's associate?

1516
01:22:47,885 --> 01:22:50,678
Yeah. His associate. [chuckling]

1517
01:22:50,679 --> 01:22:53,515
Fucking, his associate.

1518
01:22:54,391 --> 01:22:56,475
You know what I mean?
Like, of course.

1519
01:22:56,476 --> 01:22:59,854
Of course, the loan shark
of all fucking loan sharks

1520
01:22:59,855 --> 01:23:01,856
would figure out a way
to send one of his guys

1521
01:23:01,857 --> 01:23:03,858
to follow us all the way here,

1522
01:23:03,859 --> 01:23:06,319
to Niflheim, to where
we are, right now!

1523
01:23:06,320 --> 01:23:08,404
That's like a million fucking
miles from Ulaanbaatar.

1524
01:23:08,405 --> 01:23:10,823
You know what I'm talking about?
Do you know how far that is?

1525
01:23:10,824 --> 01:23:14,869
"No matter what pittance you
managed to scrape together, we found

1526
01:23:14,870 --> 01:23:19,373
that sending it to Earth will cost
you an intergalactic transfer fee.

1527
01:23:19,374 --> 01:23:22,753
More than... half
the total sum."

1528
01:23:22,878 --> 01:23:26,464
The fucking associate! I
have no idea who that is!

1529
01:23:26,465 --> 01:23:30,259
I don't know who that is.
Isn't that fucking crazy?

1530
01:23:30,260 --> 01:23:32,887
"Send a visual work of art.

1531
01:23:32,888 --> 01:23:37,058
A video file that captures
the details of death."

1532
01:23:37,059 --> 01:23:38,393
[sighs] Read the back.

1533
01:23:39,144 --> 01:23:42,104
It says chop up into a
minimum of 13 pieces.

1534
01:23:42,105 --> 01:23:45,066
Chop up? What the fuck is this?

1535
01:23:45,067 --> 01:23:47,568
Hey! What did I say
about the close-up?

1536
01:23:47,569 --> 01:23:49,237
Close-up is more
important, okay?

1537
01:23:49,238 --> 01:23:50,738
So, take the 32K camera,

1538
01:23:50,739 --> 01:23:53,282
and put it over here
for Mr. Darius Blank.

1539
01:23:53,283 --> 01:23:54,493
You understand?

1540
01:23:57,246 --> 01:23:59,121
[chain saw revs]

1541
01:23:59,122 --> 01:24:00,541
I'm sorry, Mickey.

1542
01:24:01,416 --> 01:24:05,295
Now, you see, it's all
there. Right? In the letter.

1543
01:24:05,420 --> 01:24:07,213
If I shoot this video,
and I send it to him,

1544
01:24:07,214 --> 01:24:08,798
he'll let me live.

1545
01:24:08,799 --> 01:24:10,675
[saw sputters]

1546
01:24:10,676 --> 01:24:14,136
If I don't, they're
gonna send their guy,

1547
01:24:14,137 --> 01:24:16,306
and he's gonna kill me first.

1548
01:24:17,808 --> 01:24:19,393
What am I supposed to do?

1549
01:24:20,310 --> 01:24:22,980
Come on, dude. If I
die, that's it for me.

1550
01:24:23,814 --> 01:24:24,814
But you're an Expendable.

1551
01:24:24,815 --> 01:24:26,859
They'll just print
you right back out.

1552
01:24:27,860 --> 01:24:32,405
Please, Mickey, I'm your friend.

1553
01:24:32,406 --> 01:24:34,991
Okay, please, do this for
your friend. One time.

1554
01:24:34,992 --> 01:24:37,578
You gotta do this for me,
man, I'm your brother.

1555
01:24:39,788 --> 01:24:40,788
[sighs]

1556
01:24:40,789 --> 01:24:44,417
I'm sorry. [sobs]

1557
01:24:44,418 --> 01:24:46,128
I'm sorry.

1558
01:24:46,253 --> 01:24:48,463
[voice breaks] I'm so sorry.

1559
01:24:50,549 --> 01:24:52,008
I'm so sorry.

1560
01:24:52,009 --> 01:24:53,551
Oh, shit.

1561
01:24:53,552 --> 01:24:56,053
Should have killed this
guy when we had the chance.

1562
01:24:56,054 --> 01:24:59,223
[sobs] You gotta just do
this for me this one time.

1563
01:24:59,224 --> 01:25:01,225
That's all I'm
asking. I'm so sorry.

1564
01:25:01,226 --> 01:25:05,062
Stop crying, you prick!
Getting on my fucking nerves!

1565
01:25:05,063 --> 01:25:06,190
[sniffs]

1566
01:25:07,357 --> 01:25:09,233
Why don't you guys do Rock,
Paper, Scissors, okay?

1567
01:25:09,234 --> 01:25:11,653
And then we'll just
shoot the loser, yeah?

1568
01:25:11,945 --> 01:25:14,615
No? All right. Shoot him.

1569
01:25:15,407 --> 01:25:16,407
Him?

1570
01:25:16,408 --> 01:25:17,575
Yeah, him.

1571
01:25:17,576 --> 01:25:19,827
I wasn't expecting that.
Thought you'd choose him.

1572
01:25:19,828 --> 01:25:22,413
Yeah, you'd think so, but the
soft one is easier. Come on.

1573
01:25:22,414 --> 01:25:23,414
Okay.

1574
01:25:23,957 --> 01:25:28,045
- [taser zaps]
- [grunting]

1575
01:25:28,170 --> 01:25:29,796
[body thuds]

1576
01:25:30,464 --> 01:25:32,257
[gate opens]

1577
01:25:36,637 --> 01:25:39,348
You're a dumb
fucking bitch, Timo.

1578
01:25:41,391 --> 01:25:43,392
If you do this, and
what's-his-face lets you live,

1579
01:25:43,393 --> 01:25:45,436
you think that'll
be the end of it?

1580
01:25:45,437 --> 01:25:48,482
You don't think I'll tear
you to fucking pieces myself?

1581
01:25:49,233 --> 01:25:51,442
[Mickey 18] Oh, my God.
What is the big deal?

1582
01:25:51,443 --> 01:25:53,653
Aw, just take me instead.

1583
01:25:53,654 --> 01:25:54,947
Tie him up.

1584
01:25:56,281 --> 01:25:57,448
What?

1585
01:25:57,449 --> 01:26:00,160
Just chop me up,
not him. [sniffs]

1586
01:26:00,744 --> 01:26:01,744
Look at him.

1587
01:26:02,329 --> 01:26:04,580
Shot him one time with the
Taser, it's like he just

1588
01:26:04,581 --> 01:26:07,959
boofed a fucking
electric eel, man.

1589
01:26:07,960 --> 01:26:11,505
But you can chop my whole body
up into ten Mickey chunks,

1590
01:26:11,964 --> 01:26:15,300
and I'll still be fresh
as the freshest sashimi.

1591
01:26:16,343 --> 01:26:17,469
Head held high.

1592
01:26:17,970 --> 01:26:19,555
Darius will love that.

1593
01:26:20,973 --> 01:26:22,391
I just need a
little of your help.

1594
01:26:23,016 --> 01:26:24,016
My help?

1595
01:26:24,685 --> 01:26:25,727
Um...

1596
01:26:26,645 --> 01:26:30,566
I kinda need more
of that... Oxyzofol.

1597
01:26:31,149 --> 01:26:33,359
[both laugh]

1598
01:26:33,360 --> 01:26:34,610
Yeah, I got some Oxy.

1599
01:26:34,611 --> 01:26:35,946
But undiluted.

1600
01:26:36,697 --> 01:26:37,905
[scoffs]

1601
01:26:37,906 --> 01:26:39,323
You want...

1602
01:26:39,324 --> 01:26:41,534
You want undiluted
Oxy right now?

1603
01:26:41,535 --> 01:26:43,787
Yeah.

1604
01:26:44,496 --> 01:26:46,540
Just think of it as the...

1605
01:26:47,416 --> 01:26:49,709
Think of it as the final...

1606
01:26:49,710 --> 01:26:53,380
cigarette before execution.

1607
01:26:55,424 --> 01:26:57,509
It's the least you
could do for a friend.

1608
01:26:59,553 --> 01:27:01,596
- Give him yours.
- What?

1609
01:27:01,597 --> 01:27:03,264
- Come on.
- No.

1610
01:27:03,265 --> 01:27:05,559
I'll give you a freebie
next time. You know me.

1611
01:27:07,769 --> 01:27:09,313
This was expensive.

1612
01:27:10,647 --> 01:27:12,357
- [grunts]
- [bangs cage]

1613
01:27:12,649 --> 01:27:15,068
[taser shoots, zaps]

1614
01:27:15,652 --> 01:27:16,652
[Mickey 18] The keys.

1615
01:27:19,740 --> 01:27:21,116
- [grunts]
- [groans]

1616
01:27:22,075 --> 01:27:25,829
[chain saw revs]

1617
01:27:27,748 --> 01:27:28,832
[Mickey 17] Nasha.

1618
01:27:29,333 --> 01:27:30,334
Don't.

1619
01:27:31,710 --> 01:27:32,878
Do it. [sniffs]

1620
01:27:36,465 --> 01:27:37,590
[gasping]

1621
01:27:37,591 --> 01:27:39,593
[man] Nasha, what are you doing?

1622
01:27:41,261 --> 01:27:42,720
What's going on here?

1623
01:27:42,721 --> 01:27:45,389
Nasha. Stay put.

1624
01:27:45,390 --> 01:27:46,767
- [revving slows]
- [sighs]

1625
01:27:48,310 --> 01:27:50,394
[Mickey 17, VO] <i>That did
kind of shock me a bit.</i>

1626
01:27:50,395 --> 01:27:53,022
<i>I mean, she literally was
gonna cut his head off</i>

1627
01:27:53,023 --> 01:27:54,441
<i>with a chain saw.</i>

1628
01:27:55,192 --> 01:28:00,614
<i>Uh, but then, I thought about
it, and I was so... touched.</i>

1629
01:28:03,617 --> 01:28:07,246
<i>She's the only person who'd
ever lose it like that over me.</i>

1630
01:28:08,789 --> 01:28:10,707
<i>And it wasn't the
first time either.</i>

1631
01:28:11,208 --> 01:28:12,501
[knocks on glass]

1632
01:28:12,876 --> 01:28:15,337
[Arkady] Hello? Can we help you?

1633
01:28:15,462 --> 01:28:17,005
[whispers] Nasha, just go.

1634
01:28:17,923 --> 01:28:19,131
- Take it off.
- Hey, hey, hey.

1635
01:28:19,132 --> 01:28:20,216
- I need to go in there.
- What are you doing?

1636
01:28:20,217 --> 01:28:21,467
Take it off. I am
going in there.

1637
01:28:21,468 --> 01:28:22,510
You've left him in there alone.

1638
01:28:22,511 --> 01:28:23,970
- [Arkady] But that's his job.
- [coughs]

1639
01:28:23,971 --> 01:28:25,555
[Nasha] I don't care
if it's his job.

1640
01:28:25,556 --> 01:28:27,515
[Arkady] Okay, look,
I'm gonna call security.

1641
01:28:27,516 --> 01:28:28,517
I don't know what else...

1642
01:28:28,642 --> 01:28:31,520
[Nasha] I am security!
Give me the suit!

1643
01:28:33,981 --> 01:28:35,606
[chuckles] Threes,
threes, threes.

1644
01:28:35,607 --> 01:28:37,192
- Arkady 3.0.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1645
01:28:38,694 --> 01:28:39,694
[chuckles]

1646
01:28:49,288 --> 01:28:50,455
[whispers] You're okay.

1647
01:28:58,630 --> 01:28:59,882
Shh.

1648
01:29:00,507 --> 01:29:02,801
[quiet gasping]

1649
01:29:04,678 --> 01:29:06,971
[Mickey 17, VO] <i>Nasha,
she's the only one</i>

1650
01:29:06,972 --> 01:29:09,016
<i>who's always been there for me.</i>

1651
01:29:09,933 --> 01:29:11,768
<i>She's always loved me.</i>

1652
01:29:12,686 --> 01:29:13,770
<i>Every me.</i>

1653
01:29:14,813 --> 01:29:16,273
<i>Even him.</i>

1654
01:29:17,107 --> 01:29:19,193
<i>The me I don't
understand at all.</i>

1655
01:29:20,194 --> 01:29:21,027
[Nasha] What is this?

1656
01:29:21,028 --> 01:29:22,445
[man] Oh, you don't
know about this.

1657
01:29:22,446 --> 01:29:24,197
They've been circling
the whole night.

1658
01:29:24,198 --> 01:29:25,364
And still more coming in.

1659
01:29:25,365 --> 01:29:26,782
What are they doing?

1660
01:29:26,783 --> 01:29:29,785
We don't know. They can break
through solid ice and stone.

1661
01:29:29,786 --> 01:29:32,288
Imagine if they all come
for this ship. Terrifying.

1662
01:29:32,289 --> 01:29:33,873
But it couldn't even
tear through the sack

1663
01:29:33,874 --> 01:29:34,999
at the cafeteria.

1664
01:29:35,000 --> 01:29:36,334
[squealing]

1665
01:29:36,335 --> 01:29:39,087
You hear that? It's coming from
the one we captured yesterday.

1666
01:29:39,213 --> 01:29:40,254
Keep going, keep going.

1667
01:29:40,255 --> 01:29:41,839
Wait, what... You
mean, the baby?

1668
01:29:41,840 --> 01:29:44,593
Well, yeah, it's been
screaming and crying like one.

1669
01:29:44,718 --> 01:29:46,929
And that's when they
all started gathering.

1670
01:29:49,473 --> 01:29:50,473
[Mickey 17] Wait.

1671
01:29:51,308 --> 01:29:52,975
- Hey.
- Mickey, don't stop.

1672
01:29:52,976 --> 01:29:55,144
That was... That was
the one that I...

1673
01:29:55,145 --> 01:29:56,187
Keep moving.

1674
01:29:56,188 --> 01:29:57,272
Never mind.

1675
01:29:58,357 --> 01:30:00,733
Hi! How ya doing?

1676
01:30:00,734 --> 01:30:01,818
[Arkady] Excuse me.

1677
01:30:02,402 --> 01:30:03,487
Come on.

1678
01:30:03,820 --> 01:30:05,613
Sorry, passing through.

1679
01:30:05,614 --> 01:30:08,366
Hey. Why did they set up
the Situation Room there?

1680
01:30:08,367 --> 01:30:10,159
Beats me. I was just told
to bring the prisoner.

1681
01:30:10,160 --> 01:30:11,744
[Arkady] Apparently,
Ylfa made a big scene.

1682
01:30:11,745 --> 01:30:13,621
She wants the creeper now.

1683
01:30:13,622 --> 01:30:15,122
[Nasha] Dorothy, I have
crucial information

1684
01:30:15,123 --> 01:30:16,207
about the creepers.

1685
01:30:16,208 --> 01:30:18,520
Mickey needs to file an official
report with the head of Science.

1686
01:30:18,544 --> 01:30:20,420
Oh, wait. [imitates
creeper chirping]

1687
01:30:21,213 --> 01:30:22,297
[imitates creeper chirping]

1688
01:30:23,507 --> 01:30:26,802
- [chirps]
- [chirps]

1689
01:30:29,930 --> 01:30:31,306
Yes. I knew it.

1690
01:30:31,640 --> 01:30:33,432
Yesterday, at the cafeteria,

1691
01:30:33,433 --> 01:30:35,810
when you held onto
the baby, I saw it.

1692
01:30:35,811 --> 01:30:37,312
You saw that?

1693
01:30:38,272 --> 01:30:39,605
I don't know what
it means, though.

1694
01:30:39,606 --> 01:30:41,607
Oh. So, you're just imitating.

1695
01:30:41,608 --> 01:30:42,733
Well, originally, I...

1696
01:30:42,734 --> 01:30:44,235
[Arkady] Dorothy, look alive!

1697
01:30:44,236 --> 01:30:47,154
It's really hectic right
now. Let's talk later.

1698
01:30:47,155 --> 01:30:48,275
We're recording their sounds

1699
01:30:48,365 --> 01:30:50,534
to see if we can analyze
any kind of pattern.

1700
01:30:51,451 --> 01:30:53,995
[announcer] <i>The Committee is
declaring a level three emergency.</i>

1701
01:30:53,996 --> 01:30:55,955
<i>Sole commanding control
has been granted</i>

1702
01:30:55,956 --> 01:30:57,832
<i>to Commander Marshall
by a vote of...</i>

1703
01:30:57,833 --> 01:30:58,959
<i>...36 to 21.</i>

1704
01:31:01,003 --> 01:31:02,253
[baby groans]

1705
01:31:02,254 --> 01:31:03,589
- Thank you.
- Oh.

1706
01:31:04,089 --> 01:31:04,964
[chirps]

1707
01:31:04,965 --> 01:31:08,050
What an event. This is a
truly novel ingredient.

1708
01:31:08,051 --> 01:31:09,302
[screams]

1709
01:31:09,303 --> 01:31:12,096
This opens up a whole new
world of potential sauces.

1710
01:31:12,097 --> 01:31:15,516
Mm. It's such a great...
How should I put it?

1711
01:31:15,517 --> 01:31:19,812
Opportunity, ma'am. Yes, quite
the opportunity. Just super.

1712
01:31:19,813 --> 01:31:22,440
Yes, it is a super opportunity.

1713
01:31:22,441 --> 01:31:24,526
[creepers screeching]

1714
01:31:28,071 --> 01:31:30,115
Oh, wow.

1715
01:31:31,200 --> 01:31:33,285
It's such a godsend, too.

1716
01:31:34,828 --> 01:31:36,954
It is free from harmful
pathogens, correct?

1717
01:31:36,955 --> 01:31:38,581
Yes, ma'am, sure.

1718
01:31:38,582 --> 01:31:42,753
[coughing]

1719
01:31:44,129 --> 01:31:49,593
[footsteps continue]

1720
01:31:59,019 --> 01:32:01,063
Which dickhead is it? Mickey 18?

1721
01:32:02,356 --> 01:32:03,857
Keep his head still.

1722
01:32:08,403 --> 01:32:11,365
Now, I can tell you two
apart. Filthy Multiples.

1723
01:32:11,490 --> 01:32:14,033
Oh, yeah. That does seem fair.

1724
01:32:14,034 --> 01:32:15,910
Oh, goodness. Burnt meat.

1725
01:32:15,911 --> 01:32:17,578
Well, that's nothing, honey.

1726
01:32:17,579 --> 01:32:20,540
Wait until these two are
scorched sausages in the cycler.

1727
01:32:20,541 --> 01:32:22,083
How are you gonna
handle that stench?

1728
01:32:22,084 --> 01:32:23,168
I'm going as fast as I can.

1729
01:32:24,503 --> 01:32:27,464
[whispers] Mickey. I'm so sorry.

1730
01:32:28,173 --> 01:32:30,967
You two. This brick stores
your memories, right?

1731
01:32:30,968 --> 01:32:31,926
Now, you'll watch

1732
01:32:31,927 --> 01:32:34,471
as I permanently delete
your being from it.

1733
01:32:34,930 --> 01:32:38,599
That way you'll understand the
meaning and terror of finality.

1734
01:32:38,600 --> 01:32:40,268
No more reprints!

1735
01:32:40,269 --> 01:32:42,770
That's what you both should
be thinking when you die.

1736
01:32:42,771 --> 01:32:44,106
Dead forever!

1737
01:32:45,232 --> 01:32:48,067
Now that the memory is
gone, which body goes first?

1738
01:32:48,068 --> 01:32:50,153
One at a time is twice the fun.

1739
01:32:50,612 --> 01:32:51,362
Creepy.

1740
01:32:51,363 --> 01:32:52,948
[Nasha] Commander Marshall, sir.

1741
01:32:53,824 --> 01:32:55,033
May I say a few words?

1742
01:32:55,492 --> 01:32:57,911
Regardless of who burns
first, a simple fact is,

1743
01:32:58,328 --> 01:33:00,580
we currently have two
Mickeys here before us.

1744
01:33:00,581 --> 01:33:02,915
Due to no fault on
their part, I might add.

1745
01:33:02,916 --> 01:33:04,458
One of them is being
falsely accused

1746
01:33:04,459 --> 01:33:05,627
of firing his gun at you.

1747
01:33:05,752 --> 01:33:09,423
But the truth is, he was
concerned for your safety.

1748
01:33:10,924 --> 01:33:12,341
He was the first to
notice the second creeper

1749
01:33:12,342 --> 01:33:13,509
coming out of the
stone behind you,

1750
01:33:13,510 --> 01:33:15,261
and as you are well aware

1751
01:33:15,262 --> 01:33:16,429
the day an Expendable
is printed...

1752
01:33:16,430 --> 01:33:17,430
Enough.

1753
01:33:17,681 --> 01:33:19,765
You defending these idiots.

1754
01:33:19,766 --> 01:33:21,726
Should be mopping
up your own shit.

1755
01:33:21,727 --> 01:33:24,145
Illegal possession of Oxyzofol.

1756
01:33:24,146 --> 01:33:25,855
Concealment of a
Multiples violation.

1757
01:33:25,856 --> 01:33:26,981
It's disappointing.

1758
01:33:26,982 --> 01:33:28,733
And attempted murder
with a fucking chain saw?

1759
01:33:28,734 --> 01:33:29,734
[creepers chittering]

1760
01:33:29,735 --> 01:33:31,277
I mean, it's quite the
colorful rap sheet,

1761
01:33:31,278 --> 01:33:32,547
don't you think, Miss. Barridge?

1762
01:33:32,571 --> 01:33:34,864
[Marshall] Mmm. The clouds
of war are billowing.

1763
01:33:34,865 --> 01:33:37,074
Look at those vermin swarm.

1764
01:33:37,075 --> 01:33:39,368
Mankind must unite at
this critical juncture.

1765
01:33:39,369 --> 01:33:42,788
Why are we wasting our time
with these dregs of society?

1766
01:33:42,789 --> 01:33:47,044
Spoken like a true wartime
commander, sir. Very impressive.

1767
01:33:47,169 --> 01:33:48,753
[stammers] And a fine entry

1768
01:33:48,754 --> 01:33:50,755
to add to your collection
of battle quotes, if I may.

1769
01:33:50,756 --> 01:33:52,006
- [Marshall] You like that?
- I do.

1770
01:33:52,007 --> 01:33:53,257
- More of that?
- Please.

1771
01:33:53,258 --> 01:33:55,636
You keep mentioning that
we're in a state of war.

1772
01:33:56,929 --> 01:33:59,472
May I be so bold as to
offer two observations, sir?

1773
01:33:59,473 --> 01:34:01,474
Be my guest.

1774
01:34:01,475 --> 01:34:04,143
Firstly, fighting a war
requires a huge amount

1775
01:34:04,144 --> 01:34:05,854
of energy and calories.

1776
01:34:06,647 --> 01:34:08,648
Seeing as we're in the
early stages of settlement,

1777
01:34:08,649 --> 01:34:10,650
and our survival
is in the balance,

1778
01:34:10,651 --> 01:34:13,110
I wonder whether this
expenditure is prudent.

1779
01:34:13,111 --> 01:34:16,405
Secondly, our apparent
enemies are the creepers.

1780
01:34:16,406 --> 01:34:20,243
But do we know whether they
actually want to engage in war?

1781
01:34:20,244 --> 01:34:23,204
For hours they've been swirling in
circles doing nothing but waiting.

1782
01:34:23,205 --> 01:34:26,123
My God, Agent Barridge.

1783
01:34:26,124 --> 01:34:31,255
You used to be a five time
Marshall Cup champion.

1784
01:34:31,380 --> 01:34:33,756
"Agent of the Month."

1785
01:34:33,757 --> 01:34:38,261
And now, you're sweating
over these alien insects?

1786
01:34:38,262 --> 01:34:41,265
How far you've
fallen. [chuckles]

1787
01:34:41,890 --> 01:34:42,932
What are you gonna do

1788
01:34:42,933 --> 01:34:46,270
when they tear a hole in the
ship and tear off your ass?

1789
01:34:47,729 --> 01:34:49,146
These grotesque shit-gibbons.

1790
01:34:49,147 --> 01:34:50,273
Grotesque or not,

1791
01:34:50,274 --> 01:34:52,775
they are the native
inhabitants of this planet.

1792
01:34:52,776 --> 01:34:55,403
And we have proof that
they saved one of us.

1793
01:34:55,404 --> 01:34:57,613
They didn't eat
him or attack him.

1794
01:34:57,614 --> 01:34:59,240
Saved and not eaten whom?

1795
01:34:59,241 --> 01:35:01,952
Uh, me.

1796
01:35:03,203 --> 01:35:04,746
They saved me.

1797
01:35:07,666 --> 01:35:09,918
[laughs]

1798
01:35:10,043 --> 01:35:13,129
Of course they didn't eat
you. You're crap food.

1799
01:35:13,130 --> 01:35:15,631
You're recycled Spam baby.

1800
01:35:15,632 --> 01:35:19,343
You get chewed up and shit out
over and over and over again.

1801
01:35:19,344 --> 01:35:21,596
Well, I guess they aren't
just stupid bugs, honey.

1802
01:35:21,597 --> 01:35:23,932
I mean, they knew to
pass on crap, junk.

1803
01:35:24,057 --> 01:35:26,058
They must have some
cognitive ability.

1804
01:35:26,059 --> 01:35:27,394
[Dorothy] Exactly.

1805
01:35:28,061 --> 01:35:30,730
Actually, they exhibit
signs of high intelligence.

1806
01:35:30,731 --> 01:35:33,524
They may be able to engage
in meaningful conversation.

1807
01:35:33,525 --> 01:35:35,986
And we're analyzing this, and...

1808
01:35:37,029 --> 01:35:41,616
Sir, you must try communicating
with them yourself.

1809
01:35:41,617 --> 01:35:44,869
We're developing a-a,
um, a sort of translator.

1810
01:35:44,870 --> 01:35:46,787
[clicking]

1811
01:35:46,788 --> 01:35:50,292
Like that, you mean?
You think I'm an idiot?

1812
01:35:50,876 --> 01:35:53,712
- Uh.
- [low chitter]

1813
01:35:53,837 --> 01:35:54,922
[grunts, spits]

1814
01:35:57,549 --> 01:35:58,675
[gasps]

1815
01:35:59,301 --> 01:36:00,761
[creeper laughs]

1816
01:36:02,971 --> 01:36:03,971
[chuckling]

1817
01:36:06,308 --> 01:36:08,851
- [groans]
- [Dorothy gasps]

1818
01:36:08,852 --> 01:36:12,480
Four and a half years
across the fucking galaxy,

1819
01:36:12,481 --> 01:36:16,567
just to hear these
goddamn aliens squawk?

1820
01:36:16,568 --> 01:36:20,196
Tell me how the fuck that
makes any sense! Somebody!

1821
01:36:20,197 --> 01:36:21,740
[Nasha] How does
this make any sense?

1822
01:36:22,574 --> 01:36:24,492
How does your bullshit
make any sense?

1823
01:36:24,493 --> 01:36:26,077
Your fucking fuckface

1824
01:36:26,078 --> 01:36:27,828
is what really doesn't
make any fucking sense

1825
01:36:27,829 --> 01:36:29,665
you fucking idiot!

1826
01:36:30,791 --> 01:36:33,752
You call them aliens.
We're the aliens, dumbass.

1827
01:36:33,877 --> 01:36:36,296
They were living here
before us, and Mickey...

1828
01:36:37,297 --> 01:36:39,174
Mickey was always
just Mickey Barnes.

1829
01:36:40,133 --> 01:36:41,843
Do you even understand
what that means?

1830
01:36:41,844 --> 01:36:43,845
They were just
living their lives.

1831
01:36:43,846 --> 01:36:47,223
Before you came in
with your bullshit!

1832
01:36:47,224 --> 01:36:49,600
And you think you get to
decide who lives and who dies.

1833
01:36:49,601 --> 01:36:52,521
You are a dumb fuck!

1834
01:36:54,189 --> 01:36:55,523
No wonder you blew
the elections,

1835
01:36:55,524 --> 01:36:57,401
you fucking moron.

1836
01:37:08,579 --> 01:37:11,957
[baby chitters]

1837
01:37:12,666 --> 01:37:15,711
- [Nasha] No! No, no. No, stop!
- [squealing]

1838
01:37:15,836 --> 01:37:19,590
[Nasha] What the fuck is wrong
with you? You're hurting a baby!

1839
01:37:20,174 --> 01:37:25,512
[creepers grumbling angrily]

1840
01:37:28,932 --> 01:37:29,933
Bite.

1841
01:37:30,893 --> 01:37:32,060
What?

1842
01:37:32,561 --> 01:37:35,105
Falling in three, two, one.

1843
01:37:35,230 --> 01:37:37,191
- [grunts]
- [squeals]

1844
01:37:42,446 --> 01:37:44,864
Finally, she shut the fuck up.

1845
01:37:44,865 --> 01:37:46,825
[muffled speech, panting]

1846
01:37:47,993 --> 01:37:51,121
This is clearly abuse,
one case after the other.

1847
01:37:52,664 --> 01:37:53,665
Rolling.

1848
01:37:54,499 --> 01:37:56,250
[Nasha panting]

1849
01:37:56,251 --> 01:37:58,170
[man in glasses] In 32K.

1850
01:37:59,755 --> 01:38:01,130
[boss] Make sure
you get everything.

1851
01:38:01,131 --> 01:38:03,008
- [Ylfa] Impressive teeth.
- [Marshall] Yeah.

1852
01:38:03,634 --> 01:38:05,718
We need more of our guys.

1853
01:38:05,719 --> 01:38:10,598
Sir, now might be the prime time
to initiate Total Extermination.

1854
01:38:10,599 --> 01:38:13,100
The ones out there alone
would be more than enough.

1855
01:38:13,101 --> 01:38:14,602
What are you talking about?

1856
01:38:14,603 --> 01:38:16,729
We're gonna gas 'em,
we're gonna gas 'em all.

1857
01:38:16,730 --> 01:38:19,107
[coughs]

1858
01:38:19,233 --> 01:38:22,485
What's that look for? Still
not confident in your failures?

1859
01:38:22,486 --> 01:38:25,363
No. No. Sir, Arkady 3.0

1860
01:38:25,364 --> 01:38:27,615
has gone through several
meticulous stages of testing.

1861
01:38:27,616 --> 01:38:30,785
Arkady 3.0 is the
ultimate nerve gas.

1862
01:38:30,786 --> 01:38:32,620
I have every
confidence in it, sir.

1863
01:38:32,621 --> 01:38:35,248
As you should, Arkady.
This has to succeed.

1864
01:38:35,249 --> 01:38:37,000
I'll put it in my prayers.

1865
01:38:37,751 --> 01:38:40,128
This is the day we've
been waiting for, sir.

1866
01:38:40,254 --> 01:38:42,922
Future historians will
mark today as era-defining

1867
01:38:42,923 --> 01:38:45,342
for cleansing dangerous
species on colony planets.

1868
01:38:45,801 --> 01:38:48,386
Why don't you board the
flitter yourself later?

1869
01:38:48,387 --> 01:38:50,430
- You mean when we spray the gas?
- Yeah.

1870
01:38:51,431 --> 01:38:53,599
- I pull the trigger?
- Exactly, sir.

1871
01:38:53,600 --> 01:38:55,309
If you ride the lead flitter

1872
01:38:55,310 --> 01:38:58,312
and appear to commandeer
the operation,

1873
01:38:58,313 --> 01:39:01,357
the footage I get,
it will be historic.

1874
01:39:01,358 --> 01:39:03,734
And the members, the church
members back on Earth...

1875
01:39:03,735 --> 01:39:05,320
- Huh?
- They will adore.

1876
01:39:05,779 --> 01:39:07,613
[Marshall] Yes,
yes, the company.

1877
01:39:07,614 --> 01:39:11,325
All right. It's time we initiate
Operation Total Extermination.

1878
01:39:11,326 --> 01:39:12,577
Honey, can I have
a word with you?

1879
01:39:12,578 --> 01:39:13,787
Yes, my love.

1880
01:39:14,872 --> 01:39:15,873
I've got an idea.

1881
01:39:19,334 --> 01:39:21,920
I hope you both can appreciate
what a great honor my wife

1882
01:39:22,045 --> 01:39:24,255
is bestowing on you shit stains.

1883
01:39:24,256 --> 01:39:27,633
And so I can press both
buttons simultaneously?

1884
01:39:27,634 --> 01:39:30,052
Yes, sir. Press them, and
they'll go off at the same time.

1885
01:39:30,053 --> 01:39:31,596
They'll also explode
automatically

1886
01:39:31,597 --> 01:39:33,357
if they exit the range
of the remote control.

1887
01:39:33,640 --> 01:39:35,224
[Marshall] You hear that?
I have you by the balls,

1888
01:39:35,225 --> 01:39:36,601
so don't even think
of running off.

1889
01:39:36,602 --> 01:39:38,686
You'll each be given a primitive
weapon as you head out.

1890
01:39:38,687 --> 01:39:40,771
You cut off as many
creeper tails as you can

1891
01:39:40,772 --> 01:39:44,275
and the first Mickey to bring
back 100 tails is the winner.

1892
01:39:44,276 --> 01:39:47,320
And the winner doesn't
die, but the loser goes...

1893
01:39:47,321 --> 01:39:48,821
[humming]

1894
01:39:48,822 --> 01:39:49,739
- Boom!
- Boom!

1895
01:39:49,740 --> 01:39:50,740
[Arkady] Boom.

1896
01:39:51,241 --> 01:39:53,075
[Marshall] We'll
keep score from here.

1897
01:39:53,076 --> 01:39:55,912
Your job is to make
them scream so loudly

1898
01:39:55,913 --> 01:39:59,081
that every last creeper comes
running in to save them.

1899
01:39:59,082 --> 01:40:01,210
We'll kill two birds with
one stone, right honey?

1900
01:40:01,335 --> 01:40:03,212
Absolutely. A hundred
tails is enough

1901
01:40:03,337 --> 01:40:05,087
to make enough sauce
to last a couple years.

1902
01:40:05,088 --> 01:40:07,173
[Marshall] Better
be on your toes.

1903
01:40:07,174 --> 01:40:10,010
One false move, and
you're man-burger.

1904
01:40:13,222 --> 01:40:14,932
[thud]

1905
01:40:22,606 --> 01:40:24,274
I get it.

1906
01:40:25,526 --> 01:40:27,194
It's all punishment.

1907
01:40:29,029 --> 01:40:30,030
What was that?

1908
01:40:32,157 --> 01:40:35,868
Our entire life's a
goddamn punishment.

1909
01:40:35,869 --> 01:40:38,580
All for pressing that
button when I was five.

1910
01:40:39,790 --> 01:40:43,669
Oh. This again! [scoffs]

1911
01:40:43,794 --> 01:40:46,755
Accident was caused by a
car defect, you know that.

1912
01:40:47,714 --> 01:40:49,132
I don't know.

1913
01:40:53,720 --> 01:40:56,056
Well, it wasn't pressing
that stupid button.

1914
01:40:57,933 --> 01:41:01,018
- It wasn't Mom's driving either.
- [creepers shrieking]

1915
01:41:01,019 --> 01:41:02,938
How many times I gotta tell you?

1916
01:41:03,689 --> 01:41:06,732
[snorting]

1917
01:41:06,733 --> 01:41:11,028
Sorry, Mickey... Mickeys.
You need to move, like now.

1918
01:41:11,029 --> 01:41:12,572
Can you at least
put the ramp down?

1919
01:41:12,573 --> 01:41:14,490
We can't do that
right now. I'm sorry.

1920
01:41:14,491 --> 01:41:16,201
- You're gonna have to jump.
- Whoa!

1921
01:41:18,704 --> 01:41:20,038
[Dorothy] Mickey!

1922
01:41:20,497 --> 01:41:21,498
Mickey!

1923
01:41:22,291 --> 01:41:24,459
Wait, Mickey.

1924
01:41:26,253 --> 01:41:27,253
Take this.

1925
01:41:28,505 --> 01:41:29,839
It's not finished,
but it might help you

1926
01:41:29,840 --> 01:41:31,560
- communicate with the creepers.
- Let's go!

1927
01:41:31,884 --> 01:41:33,634
It's like a... It's
like a translator thing?

1928
01:41:33,635 --> 01:41:34,803
Yes. Good luck.

1929
01:41:35,345 --> 01:41:37,471
For what it's worth, I doubt
Marshall will kill both of you.

1930
01:41:37,472 --> 01:41:38,472
Come on.

1931
01:41:39,349 --> 01:41:40,349
Come.

1932
01:41:40,642 --> 01:41:43,645
- Let's go.
- Well, I...

1933
01:41:47,608 --> 01:41:54,031
Uh, anyway, with this
device, I got a job to do.

1934
01:41:55,532 --> 01:41:59,536
All right. They saved
me, now I save them.

1935
01:42:00,162 --> 01:42:02,246
What are those fuckers doing?

1936
01:42:02,247 --> 01:42:05,416
Even I can count dozens of fresh
tails they're leaving behind.

1937
01:42:05,417 --> 01:42:07,044
Are they out of their minds?

1938
01:42:07,794 --> 01:42:09,545
Oh, honey. [chuckles]

1939
01:42:09,546 --> 01:42:12,674
- Should I just press the button?
- Mmm.

1940
01:42:13,217 --> 01:42:15,552
Let's sit back and watch.

1941
01:42:16,720 --> 01:42:18,679
They'll start chopping tails
as soon as they realize

1942
01:42:18,680 --> 01:42:21,432
one of them has to
outlive the other.

1943
01:42:21,433 --> 01:42:22,808
[creeper grunts]

1944
01:42:22,809 --> 01:42:23,894
[Mickey 17] Hey!

1945
01:42:25,187 --> 01:42:27,147
It's me! Wait!

1946
01:42:28,649 --> 01:42:32,110
You gotta run away. You gotta
get them all outta here.

1947
01:42:32,778 --> 01:42:34,363
You gotta go back to your cave.

1948
01:42:35,072 --> 01:42:38,241
Go back to your cave.

1949
01:42:38,242 --> 01:42:40,327
[stammering]

1950
01:42:41,620 --> 01:42:43,454
Or you're all gonna die.

1951
01:42:43,455 --> 01:42:44,623
[chittering]

1952
01:42:45,541 --> 01:42:46,581
[through translator] <i>What?</i>

1953
01:42:47,209 --> 01:42:48,209
Oh, hello.

1954
01:42:49,878 --> 01:42:50,963
Um...

1955
01:42:51,797 --> 01:42:55,342
Yes, I just, I wanted...
About last time, I...

1956
01:42:58,136 --> 01:43:01,055
I wanted to say thank you.

1957
01:43:01,056 --> 01:43:02,516
Um...

1958
01:43:03,809 --> 01:43:05,644
You remember me, right?

1959
01:43:06,603 --> 01:43:07,603
[grumbles]

1960
01:43:07,604 --> 01:43:08,939
<i>Mickey.</i>

1961
01:43:11,775 --> 01:43:13,569
How do you know my name?

1962
01:43:14,820 --> 01:43:16,529
[grumbles]

1963
01:43:16,530 --> 01:43:17,990
<i>Secret.</i>

1964
01:43:19,032 --> 01:43:21,243
Wait, are they having
a conversation?

1965
01:43:22,578 --> 01:43:25,580
Yes. We already
explained it just now.

1966
01:43:25,581 --> 01:43:27,290
[Marshall] How is this possible?

1967
01:43:27,291 --> 01:43:29,960
Well, it's still a prototype,

1968
01:43:30,085 --> 01:43:33,129
but it's like a
translator device.

1969
01:43:33,130 --> 01:43:36,257
Dorothy? Oh, no.
Where's Dorothy?

1970
01:43:36,258 --> 01:43:38,926
I can't hear a thing
with all this static.

1971
01:43:38,927 --> 01:43:40,929
I mean, even the video is shit.

1972
01:43:41,597 --> 01:43:44,849
Apologies, sir. The snowstorm is
exacerbating the absorption...

1973
01:43:44,850 --> 01:43:47,476
What about this? Will
this detonator work?

1974
01:43:47,477 --> 01:43:49,645
Yes, sir. That is a
special shortwave signal,

1975
01:43:49,646 --> 01:43:50,563
so it'll be fine.

1976
01:43:50,564 --> 01:43:53,024
[Marshall] And who's
that big one there?

1977
01:43:53,025 --> 01:43:54,233
Is that the queen
bee of the bunch?

1978
01:43:54,234 --> 01:43:57,028
Mmm. Looks like a
croissant dipped in shit.

1979
01:43:57,029 --> 01:44:01,115
[laughs] Uh, official reports
are still being finalized,

1980
01:44:01,116 --> 01:44:04,160
but we think everything
revolves around that one,

1981
01:44:04,161 --> 01:44:05,829
the Mama Creeper.

1982
01:44:05,954 --> 01:44:08,290
So, that one's the
boss. Like you.

1983
01:44:09,249 --> 01:44:10,374
[grumbles]

1984
01:44:10,375 --> 01:44:11,919
<i>Say what?</i>

1985
01:44:12,044 --> 01:44:14,212
You gotta get outta here,

1986
01:44:14,213 --> 01:44:16,882
or they're gonna kill you
all with this death gas.

1987
01:44:18,091 --> 01:44:22,553
That gas, Arkady 3.0, I
got blasted with that.

1988
01:44:22,554 --> 01:44:25,724
It's seriously,
insanely painful.

1989
01:44:27,684 --> 01:44:31,188
Do you know what
gas is? Gas. Like...

1990
01:44:32,189 --> 01:44:34,525
[coughing] Like gas?

1991
01:44:35,025 --> 01:44:37,818

<i>Mind your own business, stupid.</i>

1993
01:44:40,531 --> 01:44:44,034
[Mickey 18] Mind my own
business? What about you?

1994
01:44:45,035 --> 01:44:47,079
Why'd you save him at the cave?

1995
01:44:47,663 --> 01:44:49,914
[grumbles]

1996
01:44:49,915 --> 01:44:51,750
<i>Should kill him?</i>

1997
01:44:52,167 --> 01:44:54,086
No. No.

1998
01:44:55,170 --> 01:44:58,674
I'm... We're very
grateful. That's all.

1999

<i>Then why?</i>

2000
01:45:03,554 --> 01:45:05,055
<i>Why kill Luco?</i>

2001
01:45:06,139 --> 01:45:08,684
Uh, Luco?

01:47:46,216 --> 01:47:49,302
And they're saying something.
What is that idiot saying?

2044
01:47:49,303 --> 01:47:51,555
It's not sign language.

2045
01:47:51,972 --> 01:47:53,515
C3!

2046
01:47:54,057 --> 01:47:55,475
C3!

2047
01:47:59,688 --> 01:48:02,023
C... 3?

2048
01:48:02,024 --> 01:48:03,357
3?

2049
01:48:03,358 --> 01:48:05,694
C3? What's C3?

2050
01:48:05,819 --> 01:48:06,819
[muffled] C3?

2051
01:48:06,820 --> 01:48:08,697
[gong rings]

2052
01:48:15,120 --> 01:48:15,912
Bring the baby.

2053
01:48:15,913 --> 01:48:17,414
[Mickey 17] <i>Bring the baby.</i>

2054
01:48:17,831 --> 01:48:20,166
Bring the baby. [gasps]

2055
01:48:20,167 --> 01:48:21,960
<i>If we don't bring her back,</i>

2056
01:48:22,669 --> 01:48:24,420
<i>we're all gonna die.</i>

2057
01:48:24,421 --> 01:48:26,047
Honey, this doesn't
sit well with me.

2058
01:48:26,048 --> 01:48:27,840
Why are those two
losers chatting

2059
01:48:27,841 --> 01:48:28,966
with the boss of the bugs?

2060
01:48:28,967 --> 01:48:30,301
They think they're negotiating

2061
01:48:30,302 --> 01:48:32,053
on behalf of
mankind... humankind?

2062
01:48:32,054 --> 01:48:34,388
You should be standing
out there, sir,

2063
01:48:34,389 --> 01:48:36,850
ushering in this
historic moment.

2064
01:48:37,684 --> 01:48:40,353
You're seeing two bosses meeting

2065
01:48:40,354 --> 01:48:43,022
face to face in a
climactic snowstorm?

2066
01:48:43,023 --> 01:48:44,273
A moment of destiny?

2067
01:48:44,274 --> 01:48:46,317
[Preston] All you have
to do is go out there.

2068
01:48:46,318 --> 01:48:48,236
I know I can create
an iconic scene.

2069
01:48:48,237 --> 01:48:51,614
A decisive moment in the history
of the Niflheim settlement.

2070
01:48:51,615 --> 01:48:53,742
- Bring the baby.
- [Ylfa] I can picture it now.

2071
01:48:53,867 --> 01:48:57,036
Adorning the ceiling and the
walls of the grand chapel.

2072
01:48:57,037 --> 01:48:58,914
[Preston] Yes, ma'am, yes.

2073
01:48:59,623 --> 01:49:01,958
And one final touch, sir.

2074
01:49:01,959 --> 01:49:04,169
I think it would be great
if you give them a message

2075
01:49:04,294 --> 01:49:05,837
before spraying the gas.

2076
01:49:05,838 --> 01:49:06,922
[Marshall] A message?

2077
01:49:07,339 --> 01:49:10,341
Without such poignancy, today
would be a third-rate carnival

2078
01:49:10,342 --> 01:49:13,761
where we spray cheap
pesticide over cockroaches.

2079
01:49:13,762 --> 01:49:17,640
Yes, they are disgusting,
filthy, evil insects,

2080
01:49:17,641 --> 01:49:19,517
but it will be
their last moment,

2081
01:49:19,518 --> 01:49:22,103
and you could offer them
a few merciful words

2082
01:49:22,104 --> 01:49:26,733
as a proper farewell, like
a wise, benevolent priest.

2083
01:49:27,025 --> 01:49:28,401
Get me a camera crew.

2084
01:49:28,402 --> 01:49:30,111
Tell the first squad
to meet me fully armed.

2085
01:49:30,112 --> 01:49:30,945
Yes, sir.

2086
01:49:30,946 --> 01:49:34,283
My love, the Situation Room
is yours. Till we meet again.

2087
01:49:38,036 --> 01:49:38,995
[gasping]

2088
01:49:38,996 --> 01:49:41,581
C3. Nasha will
know what it means.

2089
01:49:41,582 --> 01:49:42,958
It's a whole thing.

2090
01:49:43,917 --> 01:49:46,837
I'm gonna get Zoco
back safe. I mean it.

2091
01:49:46,962 --> 01:49:49,130
[grumbling]

2092
01:49:49,131 --> 01:49:50,465
<i>Not enough.</i>

2093
01:49:51,967 --> 01:49:53,426
What else?

2094
01:49:53,427 --> 01:49:54,844
[grumbles]

2095
01:49:54,845 --> 01:49:56,762
<i>We lose Luco.</i>

2096
01:49:56,763 --> 01:49:58,097
[grumbles]

2097
01:49:58,098 --> 01:49:59,223
<i>One.</i>

2098
01:49:59,224 --> 01:50:01,560
[grumbles] <i>Be fair.</i>

2099
01:50:02,603 --> 01:50:05,856
Be fair? Like we have
to contribute a death?

2100
01:50:07,274 --> 01:50:08,317
<i>Yes.</i>

2101
01:50:09,484 --> 01:50:10,652
<i>Fair.</i>

2102
01:50:11,528 --> 01:50:14,864
<i>One of yours. Die.</i>

2103
01:50:14,865 --> 01:50:18,576
So, if we bring back Zoco
safe, and a human dies...

2104
01:50:18,577 --> 01:50:21,705
[grumbles] <i>Peace.</i>

2105
01:50:37,012 --> 01:50:38,012
Drive.

2106
01:50:52,027 --> 01:50:53,319
[Preston] You hear me?

2107
01:50:53,320 --> 01:50:55,614
Camera crew, unit
three, do you copy?

2108
01:50:56,448 --> 01:50:58,950
Okay, the radio signal's
a little patchy right now,

2109
01:50:58,951 --> 01:51:01,702
so the car speaker will be
our direct line of comms.

2110
01:51:01,703 --> 01:51:03,705
Unit two, do you copy?

2111
01:51:04,081 --> 01:51:07,542
Our orders are to safely
escort Commander Marshall...

2112
01:51:07,543 --> 01:51:13,215
No one told you to shoot!
Do not agitate the creepers!

2113
01:51:13,882 --> 01:51:16,844
Pipe down. We're not
here to film you.

2114
01:51:22,432 --> 01:51:23,641
Really great.

2115
01:51:23,642 --> 01:51:25,726
Okay, right after
your speech, sir,

2116
01:51:25,727 --> 01:51:27,520
we'll close the canopy at once,

2117
01:51:27,521 --> 01:51:31,148
and that'll be the signal for
the air squad to spray that gas.

2118
01:51:31,149 --> 01:51:33,485
Glorious annihilation, sir.

2119
01:51:34,403 --> 01:51:36,112
[panting]

2120
01:51:36,113 --> 01:51:38,239
You. Yes, you. Come here,
what's your name? Matthew?

2121
01:51:38,240 --> 01:51:42,201
Oh, Matthew, you have the face
of an angel. Here, try my sauce.

2122
01:51:42,202 --> 01:51:44,453
There you go. Tell
me what you think.

2123
01:51:44,454 --> 01:51:45,580
[man] Oh! Nasha!

2124
01:51:45,581 --> 01:51:46,789
[Ylfa screams]

2125
01:51:46,790 --> 01:51:48,959
[man] No! No! Stop!

2126
01:51:49,501 --> 01:51:52,462
Hold! She's primed
for spinal fracture.

2127
01:51:52,588 --> 01:51:55,798
I'm gonna break
this bitch's neck.

2128
01:51:55,799 --> 01:51:58,760
No, no, no. Take it
easy. Take it easy.

2129
01:52:00,762 --> 01:52:02,388
One snap and it's instant death.

2130
01:52:02,389 --> 01:52:05,058
[strained grunts]

2131
01:52:05,559 --> 01:52:07,186
Nasha Barridge,
what do you want?

2132
01:52:08,103 --> 01:52:12,065
[groans] The baby. We have
to take it to the mama.

2133
01:52:12,566 --> 01:52:14,193
- That's all?
- Yes.

2134
01:52:14,651 --> 01:52:16,153
Guarantee us a safe exit.

2135
01:52:16,904 --> 01:52:19,071
Unless you wanna see
me break her neck.

2136
01:52:19,072 --> 01:52:20,364
[Ylfa chokes]

2137
01:52:20,365 --> 01:52:22,742
- [man] No. Nasha, please don't.
- [groaning]

2138
01:52:22,743 --> 01:52:25,870
Look, we secure Nasha's
exit, as negotiated.

2139
01:52:25,871 --> 01:52:28,123
Nasha, can you
release her carefully?

2140
01:52:30,459 --> 01:52:32,461
[Nasha] I'm gonna get
the baby. Be careful.

2141
01:52:33,003 --> 01:52:33,836
[man] Nasha, are you okay?

2142
01:52:33,837 --> 01:52:35,880
[Nasha] I need to hurry.
Can I get a flitter?

2143
01:52:35,881 --> 01:52:37,841
[man] I doubt it.
You'll have to run.

2144
01:52:47,100 --> 01:52:48,684
Arrest that fucking bitch!

2145
01:52:48,685 --> 01:52:51,145
Ma'am, today you and the
commander have displayed

2146
01:52:51,146 --> 01:52:52,522
an impressive range of verbal

2147
01:52:52,523 --> 01:52:54,774
and physical abuse
and acts of cruelty

2148
01:52:54,775 --> 01:52:56,317
that far exceed your
granted authority.

2149
01:52:56,318 --> 01:52:58,987
You wanna be
executed for mutiny?

2150
01:52:59,112 --> 01:53:00,738
All video evidence of abuse

2151
01:53:00,739 --> 01:53:02,991
will be presented to the
Committee for review. [strains]

2152
01:53:03,116 --> 01:53:05,701
I suggest you have answers
prepared for your hearing.

2153
01:53:05,702 --> 01:53:07,663
- Thanks, Zeke.
- [baby cooing]

2154
01:53:08,497 --> 01:53:10,290
Maintain control onsite.

2155
01:53:11,458 --> 01:53:13,460
[warbling]

2156
01:53:19,424 --> 01:53:22,260
When we're within 100 feet
of the Mama Creeper, sir,

2157
01:53:22,261 --> 01:53:25,179
we'll start slowly
circling the creature.

2158
01:53:25,180 --> 01:53:27,348
That'll be the cue to
begin your final speech.

2159
01:53:27,349 --> 01:53:28,099
Yes.

2160
01:53:28,100 --> 01:53:31,019
The other camera will track
alongside you from the outside,

2161
01:53:31,144 --> 01:53:34,398
making the scene absolutely
spectacular, sir.

2162
01:53:35,941 --> 01:53:38,861
I'll keep my speech
short and tight.

2163
01:53:39,528 --> 01:53:42,614
A marvelous address.
No need to edit.

2164
01:53:43,240 --> 01:53:45,366
And then I blow up the Mickeys.

2165
01:53:45,367 --> 01:53:46,659
<i>Un bouquet final.</i>

2166
01:53:46,660 --> 01:53:48,244
You can do this, Nasha.

2167
01:53:48,245 --> 01:53:49,537
We'll get things
under control inside.

2168
01:53:49,538 --> 01:53:50,581
- Open the gate.
- Okay.

2169
01:53:51,748 --> 01:53:53,208
- [Nasha] See ya.
- [Zeke] Good luck!

2170
01:53:54,710 --> 01:53:56,628
[grunts]

2171
01:54:00,340 --> 01:54:01,966
[Mickey 17] Nasha's gonna
figure this all out.

2172
01:54:01,967 --> 01:54:03,635
Zoco will be back safe.

2173
01:54:04,720 --> 01:54:05,804
Who is that?

2174
01:54:06,763 --> 01:54:07,806
Who's coming?

2175
01:54:12,186 --> 01:54:13,395
Oh, shit.

2176
01:54:21,445 --> 01:54:24,781
[screeching]

2177
01:54:30,579 --> 01:54:34,208
[Mama Creeper roaring]

2178
01:54:40,047 --> 01:54:41,340
Wow.

2179
01:54:44,468 --> 01:54:45,468
[Marshall] Wait.

2180
01:54:46,094 --> 01:54:47,679
What is this bullshit?

2181
01:54:48,555 --> 01:54:49,931
[roaring]

2182
01:54:49,932 --> 01:54:51,725
[Marshall] Which
one's the mama?

2183
01:54:53,060 --> 01:54:55,269
What the fuck am I
supposed to be looking at

2184
01:54:55,270 --> 01:54:57,064
when I make my speech?

2185
01:54:59,149 --> 01:55:01,485
I was gonna send them
off with some dignity.

2186
01:55:02,361 --> 01:55:04,821
Now those barbarians
can fuck off!

2187
01:55:06,281 --> 01:55:08,909
- Is that bazooka ready?
- Yes, sir. Loading now.

2188
01:55:09,535 --> 01:55:12,204
We're gonna blast that
mama bitch into oblivion.

2189
01:55:12,621 --> 01:55:14,373
Who needs a fucking speech?

2190
01:55:15,874 --> 01:55:17,542
I'll go hard, honey.

2191
01:55:17,543 --> 01:55:19,837
That's the mama there,
sir, can you see it?

2192
01:55:19,962 --> 01:55:21,796
It has a different shape.

2193
01:55:21,797 --> 01:55:23,757
[Marshall] Yes, it's her. Aim!

2194
01:55:25,843 --> 01:55:27,802
- It's not her, dumbass!
- [grunts]

2195
01:55:27,803 --> 01:55:28,803
[soldier] Sorry, sir.

2196
01:55:28,804 --> 01:55:30,889
[chittering]

2197
01:55:32,182 --> 01:55:33,225
[gasps]

2198
01:55:35,185 --> 01:55:36,603
Mickey!

2199
01:55:37,896 --> 01:55:40,691
Nasha! Nasha!

2200
01:55:40,816 --> 01:55:43,068
[stampede rumbling]

2201
01:55:46,071 --> 01:55:47,238
Mickey?

2202
01:55:47,239 --> 01:55:50,033
[mama roaring]

2203
01:55:53,787 --> 01:55:55,163
[grunts]

2204
01:55:58,333 --> 01:56:00,335
[roaring, chittering]

2205
01:56:08,594 --> 01:56:09,970
Time to say goodbye.

2206
01:56:11,013 --> 01:56:12,139
What?

2207
01:56:23,692 --> 01:56:26,320
Blast at the nearest pile!

2208
01:56:26,695 --> 01:56:30,615
Tear through them all until we
get to the mama. Smash them!

2209
01:56:30,616 --> 01:56:33,868
Camera, make sure to
get the blood and guts.

2210
01:56:33,869 --> 01:56:36,413
Wait. That one there.

2211
01:56:36,997 --> 01:56:38,915
Shoot that one
first. It's bigger.

2212
01:56:38,916 --> 01:56:40,041
Fire!

2213
01:56:40,042 --> 01:56:41,375
- Fire now!
- [soldier] Yes, sir.

2214
01:56:41,376 --> 01:56:44,671
[low rumble]

2215

No! No, sir. It's too close!

Nasha! Hey!

2225
01:57:10,864 --> 01:57:13,616

it. Is the baby okay?

[Marshall] No, no, no.

What's going on?

2229
01:57:19,373 --> 01:57:20,415
Look!

2230

[Mickey 17] We have Zoco!
Nasha brought her back.

Zoco's okay, right?

2235
01:57:38,141 --> 01:57:39,476
[Mickey 18] Hey!

2236
01:57:40,435 --> 01:57:41,645
Are you seeing this?

2237
01:57:44,314 --> 01:57:47,526
One human! [grunting]

[Mickey 18, Marshall, grunting]

2240

You're also afraid.

2241
01:58:13,010 --> 01:58:14,511
We're both afraid.

2242
01:58:15,637 --> 01:58:19,223
[exhales] Yeah, I'm afraid.

2243
01:58:19,224 --> 01:58:20,893
[Marshall] It
means you're human.

2244
01:58:22,811 --> 01:58:24,062
You're important.

2245
01:58:25,647 --> 01:58:27,524
Come to me, my boy.

Guys, don't be shy. If you
could sit down. Take your seats.

2255
01:59:25,874 --> 01:59:28,501
The groundbreaking
ceremony will come later,

2256
01:59:28,502 --> 01:59:30,670
but we'll start with
the Expendable stuff.

2257
01:59:30,671 --> 01:59:33,798
Mickey. Mickey, come
up to the front, mate.

2258
01:59:33,799 --> 01:59:37,553
Could someone please sit in the
front row, you fucking introverts?

2259
01:59:44,226 --> 01:59:45,935
Hello, everyone.

2260
01:59:45,936 --> 01:59:48,312
I'm Nasha Barridge,
member of the Committee.

2261
01:59:48,313 --> 01:59:51,148
- [cheers and applause]
- [chirps]

2262
01:59:51,149 --> 01:59:52,316
[Nasha] After weeks of debate,

2263
01:59:52,317 --> 01:59:54,903
we have finally come
to this momentous day.

2264
01:59:55,571 --> 01:59:58,073
The day we abolish the
Expendables program.

2265
01:59:58,490 --> 02:00:00,491
I would like to thank my
fellow Committee members

2266
02:00:00,492 --> 02:00:01,450
for their support.

2267
02:00:01,451 --> 02:00:04,078
I've been really
feeling the love.

2268
02:00:04,079 --> 02:00:07,456
And especially, for
fighting right to the end,

2269
02:00:07,457 --> 02:00:09,418
and persuading the Committee

2270
02:00:09,543 --> 02:00:11,545
to permanently abolish
human printing...

2271
02:00:12,462 --> 02:00:15,882
I would like to thank our
very own Mickey Barnes.

2272
02:00:15,883 --> 02:00:17,717
[light cheers and applause]

2273
02:00:17,718 --> 02:00:19,969
And to be fair, I'm
just so fucking happy

2274
02:00:19,970 --> 02:00:21,304
I get to grow old with Mickey.

2275
02:00:21,305 --> 02:00:24,307
It was really sucking
getting old by myself. Okay.

2276
02:00:24,308 --> 02:00:26,058
[scattered chuckles]

2277
02:00:26,059 --> 02:00:27,393
Despite the hours of
peaceful discussion...

2278
02:00:27,394 --> 02:00:28,478
All right.

2279
02:00:29,813 --> 02:00:30,813
So, you hit the button.

2280
02:00:30,814 --> 02:00:31,940
- Mm-hmm.
- Wait.

2281
02:00:33,025 --> 02:00:35,484
Nasha will give the
signal. You hit the button.

2282
02:00:35,485 --> 02:00:37,946
Wait. And then over there, boom.

2283
02:00:38,655 --> 02:00:41,491
Do I get up and press it
or... No, in my seat, right?

2284
02:00:41,617 --> 02:00:43,785
I honestly couldn't give a fuck.

2285
02:00:45,746 --> 02:00:48,706
[Nasha] Henceforth, on
Niflheim as on Earth,

2286
02:00:48,707 --> 02:00:51,960
human printing is now
permanently abolished.

2287
02:00:52,085 --> 02:00:55,254
[cheers and applause]

2288
02:00:55,255 --> 02:00:59,634
Here today, the human printer
will be burnt to ashes

2289
02:00:59,635 --> 02:01:01,220
and erased from memory.

Marshall got blown to dust,</i>

he brought his knife around

to my mid-section right
here, and he sliced...

2315

released on self-defense.</i>

had made up her mind.</i>

2322
02:02:30,934 --> 02:02:34,187

and change it herself.</i>

2323

the supreme one with an
actually refined palate.

02:06:45,105 --> 02:06:47,356
[machine rumbles]

2387
02:06:47,357 --> 02:06:49,526
Wait, that's...

2388
02:06:51,028 --> 02:06:54,072
Even his kidneys are
more handsome than you.

2389
02:06:57,743 --> 02:07:00,369
Not this. It can't be.

2390
02:07:00,370 --> 02:07:02,998
[coughing]

2391
02:07:04,291 --> 02:07:05,751
Of course it can.

2392
02:07:06,460 --> 02:07:09,004
- Admit it, it's what you want.
- [gasping]

2393
02:07:09,129 --> 02:07:12,758
- It's what everyone wants.

2394
02:07:13,800 --> 02:07:15,385
Hey Ylfa.

2395
02:07:17,137 --> 02:07:19,056
I just remembered.

2396
02:07:22,142 --> 02:07:25,854
You died the day after Marshall.

2397
02:07:44,790 --> 02:07:47,543
Go ahead, touch me.

2398
02:07:49,253 --> 02:07:52,089
See if I'm ghost or human.

[Mickey 17, VO] <i>Ever since I was
a kid, I've had scary dreams.</i>

2400
02:08:01,223 --> 02:08:03,642
<i>This time I wasn't scared.</i>

2401
02:08:04,351 --> 02:08:05,853
<i>I just thought to myself,</i>

2402
02:08:06,478 --> 02:08:08,355
<i>"What would 18 do?"</i>

2403
02:08:09,773 --> 02:08:11,107
Fuck off.

2404
02:08:11,108 --> 02:08:12,441
[cheering]

2405
02:08:12,442 --> 02:08:14,193
What are you doing?
Press the button.

2406
02:08:14,194 --> 02:08:16,321
Mickey. Press it.

2407
02:08:17,739 --> 02:08:18,782
Do it.

2408
02:08:20,075 --> 02:08:21,285
[beeps]

2409

[Mickey 17, VO] <i>I am
glad the printer's gone,</i>

2410
02:08:30,043 --> 02:08:32,336
<i>but a part of me can't
help feeling guilty</i>

2411
02:08:32,337 --> 02:08:36,424
<i>that I didn't let all the other
Mickeys have a chance at life.</i>

2412
02:08:36,425 --> 02:08:38,384
<i>But I have to stop
feeling guilty.</i>

2413
02:08:38,385 --> 02:08:39,845
[woman in crowd] Mickey!

02:08:40,179 --> 02:08:42,347
[Mickey 17, VO] <i>It's
okay for me to be happy.</i>
