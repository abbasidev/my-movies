Mind Body Spirit is so much
more than a fitness channel.

00:02:20,705 --> 00:02:23,360
It is a journey
to self discovery,

and aligning our
mind, body, and spirit

00:02:25,884 --> 00:02:28,539
is the closest we can
get to our truest selves.

But in order to
make that discovery,

19
00:02:30,367 --> 00:02:32,239
we've gotta be
willing to take risks.

make a change in my life.

We will recharge our

are the places

stretch all the way back,

squeeze those inner
thighs, engage that core.

52

that you are a little bit
limited in flexibility,

00:15:24,227 --> 00:15:26,273
but you've never actually
told me who she was.

183
00:15:27,883 --> 00:15:30,320
You never told me
she was spiritual.

184
00:15:30,451 --> 00:15:32,571
I can't tell you about a
woman who was never around.

185
00:15:34,063 --> 00:15:36,152
That's a pretty heavy
pour, sweetheart.

186
00:15:38,894 --> 00:15:40,654
Verasha only came back
when she needed something.

187
00:15:40,678 --> 00:15:43,464
All she did was take
and take and take.

188
00:15:45,857 --> 00:15:47,250
And now she's
taking you from me.

189
00:15:48,556 --> 00:15:51,341
Jesus, mom, she hasn't
taken me from you.

190
00:15:51,472 --> 00:15:54,562
If anything, she's
given me a place

191
00:15:54,692 --> 00:15:58,087
to finally figure
myself out, you know?

192
00:15:58,218 --> 00:16:00,568
And you can't do
that here at home?

193
00:16:00,698 --> 00:16:03,484
I, I can move my things
out of your room.

194
00:16:03,614 --> 00:16:05,660
I'm not coming home, okay?

195
00:16:05,790 --> 00:16:09,185
I've literally spent all that
I have just to get out here.

196
00:16:09,316 --> 00:16:11,753
Anya, I know that.

197
00:16:12,580 --> 00:16:15,713
I just wanna make sure that
you're safe, that you're okay.

198
00:16:15,844 --> 00:16:16,976
I'm okay.

199
00:16:17,106 --> 00:16:19,630
Good. I just wanna help you.

200
00:16:21,545 --> 00:16:23,025
Yeah, well then you should have.

201
00:16:29,684 --> 00:16:30,859
[dog barking]

202
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:34,123
This fucking dog.

203
00:16:34,254 --> 00:16:36,647
Boris, you get out
of here right now!

204
00:16:36,778 --> 00:16:37,953
Asshole! Quick!

205
00:16:41,913 --> 00:16:44,525
Did you ever think
that maybe grandma

206
00:16:44,655 --> 00:16:49,095
felt like she had to
leave to find herself?

207
00:16:49,225 --> 00:16:50,922
And why would you say that?

208
00:16:51,053 --> 00:16:54,752
Because she said
so in her journal.

209
00:16:56,885 --> 00:16:59,322
I see. Is that
what you believe?

210
00:16:59,453 --> 00:17:02,238
It's, it's not about
what I believe.

211
00:17:02,369 --> 00:17:05,241
That's what I have to do.
That's what I am doing.

212
00:17:05,372 --> 00:17:09,376
Anya, I just, I just don't
want you to waste your life

213
00:17:09,506 --> 00:17:10,744
obsessing over your grandmother.

214
00:17:10,768 --> 00:17:14,207
Obsessing? I am
not obsessing, mom.

215
00:17:14,337 --> 00:17:16,035
That's not what I meant, baby.

216
00:17:16,165 --> 00:17:19,038
You just, you get
so lost in things.

217
00:17:19,168 --> 00:17:21,214
And I am not there
to pull you out.

218
00:17:21,344 --> 00:17:22,389
I know what I'm doing.

219
00:17:23,781 --> 00:17:25,044
Of course, you do.

220
00:17:26,045 --> 00:17:29,874
But listen, if you wanna find
yourself, go find yourself.

221
00:17:30,005 --> 00:17:33,748
Go anywhere. Just
not, not there.

222
00:17:36,098 --> 00:17:37,621
None of us knew
that place existed.

223
00:17:37,752 --> 00:17:40,363
Yeah, well maybe she
didn't want you to know.

224
00:17:40,494 --> 00:17:42,409
Maybe all of this was
always just for me.

225
00:17:42,539 --> 00:17:44,063
Maybe she saw herself in me

226
00:17:44,193 --> 00:17:45,977
in a way that she
could never see in you.

227
00:17:47,153 --> 00:17:50,112
Oh, Anya, I promise you,

228
00:17:51,418 --> 00:17:53,159
you are nothing like her.

229
00:17:54,247 --> 00:17:55,378
- Goodbye, Lenka.
- Anya-

230
00:18:16,834 --> 00:18:17,966
Hey guys!

231
00:18:18,097 --> 00:18:21,622
Oh my God. I'm sorry. Reflex.
- That's okay.

232
00:18:21,752 --> 00:18:22,449
Do your thing, girl.

233
00:18:22,579 --> 00:18:24,146
Yeah, no, totally. No worries.

234
00:18:26,583 --> 00:18:27,583
Okay.

235
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:31,936
Welcome everyone, I'm Anya.

236
00:18:32,067 --> 00:18:34,113
And today we have a
very special guest.

237
00:18:34,243 --> 00:18:37,377
This is Kenzi Duffert.

238
00:18:37,507 --> 00:18:39,857
Oh, I, I don't use that
name professionally.

239
00:18:39,988 --> 00:18:41,487
- Fuck! Oh, I'm sorry-
- No, that's okay.

240
00:18:41,511 --> 00:18:43,426
- I'm so sorry.
- That's totally cool.

241
00:18:43,557 --> 00:18:44,957
- I'm sorry.
- Don't worry about it.

242
00:18:45,341 --> 00:18:47,561
Thank you for doing
this with me again.

243
00:18:49,476 --> 00:18:51,260
Yeah, of course, chigger.

244
00:18:51,391 --> 00:18:53,191
Your mom said that you
were really struggling,

245
00:18:53,219 --> 00:18:54,219
so I'm happy to help.

246
00:18:56,352 --> 00:18:59,442
- Yes, thank you.
- Yeah.

247
00:19:01,966 --> 00:19:02,966
Okay.

248
00:19:03,838 --> 00:19:05,970
Welcome everyone, I am Anya,

249
00:19:06,101 --> 00:19:07,842
and today we have a
very special guest.

250
00:19:07,972 --> 00:19:11,193
This is KenziFit.
- Hey guys.

251
00:19:12,412 --> 00:19:13,761
Kenzi and I grew up together

252
00:19:13,891 --> 00:19:16,720
and we recently reconnected
when I moved out here.

253
00:19:16,851 --> 00:19:20,507
And I'm just so excited to
partner with her on today's video

254
00:19:20,637 --> 00:19:22,552
and to really learn about
how she's connecting

255
00:19:22,683 --> 00:19:24,119
with her fan base.

256
00:19:24,250 --> 00:19:25,947
I'll be guiding you

257
00:19:26,077 --> 00:19:28,515
through my 10 minute total
body takeover strength flow,

258
00:19:28,645 --> 00:19:30,952
a little bit of yoga, a
little bit of lifting,

259
00:19:31,082 --> 00:19:32,519
and a lot of sweat.

260
00:19:32,649 --> 00:19:33,649
So get ready.

261
00:19:36,392 --> 00:19:39,439
Okay, how do you
normally kick things off?

262
00:19:39,569 --> 00:19:43,225
Um, well, let's, I don't know,

263
00:19:43,356 --> 00:19:45,749
I kind of keep things
pretty loose, you know,

264
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:47,708
and it's all about
the discovery process.

265
00:19:47,838 --> 00:19:49,275
All my things are about-

266
00:19:49,405 --> 00:19:50,426
Ah ha. So how do
you kick things off?

267
00:19:50,450 --> 00:19:51,450
Process.

268
00:19:52,974 --> 00:19:56,543
Well, usually I start talking
about how I'm feeling and-

269
00:19:56,673 --> 00:19:58,588
- Okay.
- Yeah.

270
00:19:58,719 --> 00:19:59,719
First tip.

271
00:20:01,417 --> 00:20:02,417
Right.

272
00:20:05,334 --> 00:20:07,641
No one gives a shit
about how you feel.

273
00:20:07,771 --> 00:20:09,773
People only care
about themselves.

274
00:20:09,904 --> 00:20:13,255
They want structure,
not a therapy session.

275
00:20:13,386 --> 00:20:15,605
So you gotta be fearless.
- Fearless.

276
00:20:16,606 --> 00:20:19,305
Um, you're also going to
want to build your brand.

277
00:20:20,741 --> 00:20:22,960
Something that
helps you stand out,

278
00:20:23,091 --> 00:20:24,223
you know, find your thing.

279
00:20:25,267 --> 00:20:26,486
Oh, um...

280
00:20:28,183 --> 00:20:30,925
What about, what about this?

281
00:20:31,055 --> 00:20:33,057
- Oh, God.
- This is my grandma's.

282
00:20:33,188 --> 00:20:35,103
And she was like collecting
all these rituals

283
00:20:35,234 --> 00:20:36,931
from our homeland and it's...

284
00:20:37,061 --> 00:20:40,587
Um, I mean, that might
be a little too obscure.

285
00:20:40,717 --> 00:20:41,912
People want things
that they know,

286
00:20:41,936 --> 00:20:43,764
but like with a little
extra personality.

287
00:20:43,894 --> 00:20:47,158
So remix some yoga flows,
pepper in some Sanskrit.

288
00:20:48,159 --> 00:20:49,770
Yeah, I know.

289
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:52,183
I just, I don't really feel
comfortable teaching a language

290
00:20:52,207 --> 00:20:54,253
that I don't actually
speak, you know?

291
00:20:54,383 --> 00:20:56,037
Fake it till you make it.

292
00:20:56,167 --> 00:20:57,038
Listen, people don't really care

293
00:20:57,168 --> 00:20:58,605
as long as you seem authentic.

294
00:20:58,735 --> 00:20:59,823
But this is authentic.

295
00:20:59,954 --> 00:21:01,347
No one wants to read old books.

296
00:21:05,525 --> 00:21:07,178
Look, you wanna be
successful, right?

297
00:21:10,007 --> 00:21:11,748
Yeah. Yes.

298
00:21:12,662 --> 00:21:15,143
So, how many videos
have you dropped so far?

299
00:21:16,492 --> 00:21:19,016
I just started recording them.

300
00:21:19,147 --> 00:21:23,630
I was gonna, I was gonna
release them all when I'm ready.

301
00:21:24,631 --> 00:21:28,025
Okay, so you haven't
put anything out yet?

302
00:21:28,939 --> 00:21:31,222
Well, no, I just, I didn't
want it to seem like bullshit,

303
00:21:31,246 --> 00:21:33,422
I wanted it to be true to me.

304
00:21:34,336 --> 00:21:36,077
Okay, well, you're not
gonna get any views

305
00:21:36,207 --> 00:21:37,774
if you don't have
anything to watch.

306
00:21:40,299 --> 00:21:42,736
Oh girl, that is not even
a tip. That's just a fact.

307
00:21:44,999 --> 00:21:45,999
Okay.

308
00:21:48,263 --> 00:21:49,936
Oh shit, I have to teach
a class in like an hour.

309
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:51,614
Can we do this?

310
00:21:52,833 --> 00:21:53,833
Yeah, absolutely.

311
00:21:53,877 --> 00:21:55,575
- Like now-ish.
- Okay. Yep. Cool.

312
00:22:01,668 --> 00:22:03,234
Namaste, bitches.

313
00:22:03,365 --> 00:22:06,368
We're getting started with
two hand front race swings.

314
00:22:06,499 --> 00:22:08,109
Thirty seconds starts now.

315
00:22:13,462 --> 00:22:16,552
[deep exhale] And up!

316
00:22:16,683 --> 00:22:17,858
And up!

317
00:22:17,988 --> 00:22:18,988
And up!

318
00:22:19,990 --> 00:22:21,296
Keep that core tight!

319
00:22:23,254 --> 00:22:25,474
Feeling the burn, Anya.
- Oh yeah.

320
00:22:25,605 --> 00:22:28,869
- Yeah, this is intense.
- Yes. Get it, girl.

321
00:22:28,999 --> 00:22:30,958
- Woo. Wow.
- Woo.

322
00:22:31,088 --> 00:22:33,743
Up and up! Squeeze
your glutes.

323
00:22:33,874 --> 00:22:35,745
- Squeezing.
- Up to the sky.

324
00:22:35,876 --> 00:22:37,094
Smile through the pain!

325
00:22:40,707 --> 00:22:41,707
Okay.

326
00:22:42,970 --> 00:22:44,101
Hi everyone. Ugh.

327
00:22:46,321 --> 00:22:50,151
Hey, hi. Greetings.
Namaste, whatever.

328
00:22:52,588 --> 00:22:56,592
Everyone has this voice
inside of themselves

329
00:22:56,723 --> 00:22:59,987
that really feels like
their truth, right?

330
00:23:01,336 --> 00:23:04,295
But then there's all
these other voices

331
00:23:04,426 --> 00:23:06,226
that are telling you
that that truth is a lie.

332
00:23:06,297 --> 00:23:07,647
And...

333
00:23:09,126 --> 00:23:10,519
maybe they're right,

334
00:23:12,260 --> 00:23:16,960
but it's really hard to know
which voice to listen to.

335
00:23:20,050 --> 00:23:24,272
But the most important
thing is that we make space

336
00:23:24,403 --> 00:23:27,536
for ourselves to listen, right?

337
00:23:27,667 --> 00:23:30,539
So in the interest
of an open mind,

338
00:23:30,670 --> 00:23:34,325
we are going to do a
mindful meditation.

339
00:23:34,456 --> 00:23:36,023
Find yourself in Sukhasana.

340
00:23:37,111 --> 00:23:39,940
You know what? Nah, forget that.

341
00:23:40,070 --> 00:23:43,465
Just sit however you want, but
make sure you're comfortable.

342
00:23:43,596 --> 00:23:46,990
Feel yourself connecting
to the earth. [deep exhale]

343
00:23:47,121 --> 00:23:51,299
Lengthen your spine.
Soften your eyes.

344
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:53,780
Inhale into your belly.

345
00:23:53,910 --> 00:23:57,000
[deep inhale]

346
00:23:57,131 --> 00:23:59,786
Exhale. Let it all go.

347
00:23:59,916 --> 00:24:01,657
[deep exhale]

348
00:24:01,788 --> 00:24:04,399
Inhale into your belly.

349
00:24:04,530 --> 00:24:06,923
[deep inhale]

350
00:24:07,924 --> 00:24:12,102
Exhale. Let it go. [deep exhale]

351
00:24:12,233 --> 00:24:17,412
And in. [eerie music]

352
00:24:17,543 --> 00:24:18,543
And out.

353
00:24:21,851 --> 00:24:22,851
And in.

354
00:24:26,203 --> 00:24:28,031
And as you continue this rhythm,

355
00:24:28,162 --> 00:24:30,294

00:40:10,756 --> 00:40:14,455
And listen, yeah, maybe I am
crazy to keep going with this.

537
00:40:14,586 --> 00:40:15,804
Definitely not not crazy.

538
00:40:18,894 --> 00:40:23,464
I have discovered something
powerful in these pages,

539
00:40:23,595 --> 00:40:28,121
in this practice,
something beyond me.

540
00:40:28,251 --> 00:40:29,644
That is where Verasha went,

541
00:40:29,775 --> 00:40:31,385
and that is where
she wants me to go.

542
00:40:31,516 --> 00:40:36,129
And I, I've gotta be fearless
in order to get there.

543
00:40:36,259 --> 00:40:37,259
It...

544
00:40:38,697 --> 00:40:41,003
Otherwise, I'll just end up
right back where I started

545
00:40:41,134 --> 00:40:42,134
and...

546
00:40:48,968 --> 00:40:50,230
I hope you can understand,

547
00:40:51,971 --> 00:40:53,451
and I hope you're still with me.

548
00:41:01,894 --> 00:41:04,592
[blender roaring]

549
00:41:05,941 --> 00:41:08,378
[eerie music]

550
00:41:37,843 --> 00:41:38,931
Hi.

551
00:41:39,061 --> 00:41:40,715
Right, day 12,

552
00:41:40,846 --> 00:41:45,415
the next part of our practice
is called "the many."

553
00:41:45,546 --> 00:41:48,854
But there's only
half a page here.

554
00:41:48,984 --> 00:41:52,466
It's like a poem or a
riddle or something.

555
00:41:52,597 --> 00:41:56,383
"The many selves
share only one mind.

556
00:41:56,514 --> 00:42:00,518
And you can't see the truth
when your thoughts are blind."

557
00:42:31,505 --> 00:42:32,505
Blind eye.

558
00:42:56,138 --> 00:42:58,140
Come on, Anya, get burned.

559
00:43:03,624 --> 00:43:06,453
[glass shattering]

560
00:43:30,869 --> 00:43:32,087
Oh, geez.

561
00:43:34,699 --> 00:43:37,615
Okay, so, the many.

562
00:43:39,312 --> 00:43:44,012
The journal says that this is
a remedy for the cleansing.

563
00:43:46,754 --> 00:43:49,931
Kind of like an herbal
elixir to heal the body

564
00:43:50,062 --> 00:43:51,933
and expand the mind.

565
00:43:54,240 --> 00:43:59,114
So, okay, "you must
consider your many self"

566
00:43:59,724 --> 00:44:01,421
all facets of your being.

567
00:44:01,551 --> 00:44:03,684
"So you might see
yourself as one whole."

568
00:44:05,555 --> 00:44:08,167
So essentially, you gotta relax.

569
00:44:08,297 --> 00:44:09,908
[kettle whistling]

570
00:44:10,038 --> 00:44:11,300
So I know that most of you

571
00:44:11,431 --> 00:44:13,912
don't have a mystery
bottle of tea leaves

572
00:44:14,042 --> 00:44:16,349
hiding around in your dead
grandma's secret crawlspace.

573
00:44:16,479 --> 00:44:19,004
But you know, you can use
any kind of herbal remedy

574
00:44:19,134 --> 00:44:20,135
that you have,

575
00:44:20,266 --> 00:44:22,877
maybe some CBD, whatever
mellows you out.

576
00:44:27,055 --> 00:44:30,189
Last time I did shrooms,
I was at the zoo,

577
00:44:30,319 --> 00:44:33,671
and I cried for like six hours.

578
00:44:37,065 --> 00:44:38,719
Let's hope that
doesn't happen again.

579
00:44:40,808 --> 00:44:43,419
Cheers, Verasha. Cheers to you.

580
00:44:46,118 --> 00:44:47,118
Here we go.

581
00:44:49,774 --> 00:44:50,774
Ugh. Woo.

582
00:44:53,081 --> 00:44:54,081
Ah, gross.

583
00:44:55,910 --> 00:44:56,910
Okay.

584
00:44:59,305 --> 00:45:00,305
Gross.

585
00:45:13,841 --> 00:45:15,756
I definitely do feel a
little calmer though.

586
00:45:18,237 --> 00:45:21,762
So, yes.

587
00:45:21,893 --> 00:45:25,635
The next thing that we
have to do is we have to...

588
00:45:28,421 --> 00:45:29,509
So the next...

589
00:45:34,470 --> 00:45:35,471
next thing...

590
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:56,318
[distant thunder rumbling]

591
00:46:31,789 --> 00:46:34,922
[groaning and panting]

592
00:46:49,154 --> 00:46:53,898
[thunder rumbling]
[sinister laughing]

593
00:47:07,607 --> 00:47:12,394
[thunder rumbling]
[sinister laughing]

594
00:47:18,748 --> 00:47:23,492
[thunder rumbling]
[sinister screaming]

595
00:47:29,411 --> 00:47:34,155
[thunder rumbling]
[sinister laughing]

596
00:48:03,924 --> 00:48:06,492
[phone ringing]

597
00:48:10,322 --> 00:48:12,019
[Lenka] Hello?

598
00:48:12,150 --> 00:48:13,368
Hello.

599
00:48:13,499 --> 00:48:17,024
[Lenka] Anya, are are you
all right? It's so late.

600
00:48:18,678 --> 00:48:22,943
Anya, are you all
right? It's so late.

601
00:48:23,074 --> 00:48:25,250
[Lenka] Anya, is that you?

602
00:48:27,295 --> 00:48:29,055
Who am I speaking to?
- Who am I speaking to?

603
00:48:34,389 --> 00:48:36,348
Anya, are you, are you there?

604
00:48:39,786 --> 00:48:40,786
Anya?

605
00:48:41,744 --> 00:48:42,744
Hello?

606
00:48:43,659 --> 00:48:44,659
Anya?

607
00:48:47,054 --> 00:48:49,927
Anya? Anya, are you there?

608
00:48:51,406 --> 00:48:52,755
Mom?

609
00:48:52,886 --> 00:48:54,932
[Lenka] Anya? Honey,
what is going on?

610
00:48:56,716 --> 00:49:00,981
- We're okay.
- We, who's there with you?

611
00:49:01,112 --> 00:49:04,854
I'm, I'm okay. I
don't, I don't know.

612
00:49:04,985 --> 00:49:06,726
I just had a bad dream.
It's, it's nothing.

613
00:49:06,856 --> 00:49:08,989
I'm sorry I called.

614
00:49:09,120 --> 00:49:10,686
[Lenka] Are you
sure you're okay?

615
00:49:14,734 --> 00:49:15,822
Who is there with you?

616
00:49:16,910 --> 00:49:17,910
Grandma.

617
00:49:34,145 --> 00:49:37,278
[knocking at the door]

618
00:49:39,715 --> 00:49:41,152
Hey, thank you so
much for coming.

619
00:49:41,282 --> 00:49:42,544
[Kenzi] Yeah, for sure.

620
00:49:46,592 --> 00:49:47,592
Oh...

621
00:49:49,464 --> 00:49:51,336
we've been redecorating.

622
00:49:53,077 --> 00:49:54,077
[Anya] I guess so.

623
00:49:58,386 --> 00:50:00,171
Kinda looks like
my grandma's house.

624
00:50:00,301 --> 00:50:01,301
Thank you.

625
00:50:07,482 --> 00:50:09,876
So how are the videos going?

626
00:50:12,183 --> 00:50:15,925
I'm really excited to show
you what I've been working on.

627
00:50:16,056 --> 00:50:17,362
I can't wait.

628
00:50:24,630 --> 00:50:26,719
Jesus, Anya, have
you been eating?

629
00:50:28,634 --> 00:50:30,810
I've been focusing
on making space.

630
00:50:32,072 --> 00:50:34,727
Well, maybe you make space for
a Caesar wrap or something.

631
00:50:41,821 --> 00:50:44,258
Look, are you, are you
sure you wanna shoot this?

632
00:50:45,825 --> 00:50:46,825
Why?

633
00:50:49,176 --> 00:50:52,788
You look not great?

634
00:50:54,094 --> 00:50:55,094
I'm fine.

635
00:50:58,533 --> 00:50:59,533
Okay.

636
00:51:08,674 --> 00:51:10,241
[creaking]

637
00:51:10,371 --> 00:51:11,981
Is someone else here?

638
00:51:13,157 --> 00:51:15,246
No, it's just us.

639
00:51:30,870 --> 00:51:35,092
Hi everyone, welcome back to
Mind Body Spirit, I'm Anya.

640
00:51:35,222 --> 00:51:38,921
It's day 17. Let's get
started with today's practice.

641
00:51:40,749 --> 00:51:43,361
And I'm Kenzi from KenziFit.

642
00:51:43,491 --> 00:51:45,276
Right.

643
00:51:45,406 --> 00:51:47,321
Do you wanna start over again?

644
00:51:47,452 --> 00:51:48,583
No, not really.

645
00:51:53,501 --> 00:51:54,850
And this is Kenzi.

646
00:51:54,981 --> 00:51:57,897
She'll be joining us
for today's practice.

647
00:51:58,027 --> 00:52:01,118
The expansion, the joining.

648
00:52:03,685 --> 00:52:04,685
Wait, sorry.

649
00:52:06,471 --> 00:52:09,213
Can, can we stop this a second?

650
00:52:09,343 --> 00:52:11,650
I, I thought this was
gonna be like a flow.

651
00:52:11,780 --> 00:52:13,304
What, what is this?

652
00:52:14,914 --> 00:52:16,742
This is Verasha.

653
00:52:18,874 --> 00:52:21,573
- What the fuck is a Verasha?
- My grandmother.

654
00:52:24,097 --> 00:52:28,362
- Okay, can we cut?
- Why? What's wrong?

655
00:52:28,493 --> 00:52:31,887
I'm, I'm not doing whatever
this is. This isn't my thing.

656
00:52:32,018 --> 00:52:33,541
Yeah, I know. It's my thing.

657
00:52:33,672 --> 00:52:35,369
Okay, great for you, I guess,

658
00:52:35,500 --> 00:52:38,024
but like this isn't
on brand for me.

659
00:52:38,155 --> 00:52:39,504
Like, what even is this?
- Hey!

660
00:52:39,634 --> 00:52:43,116
Whoa. Chill. Jesus,
Anya, look at yourself.

661
00:52:44,770 --> 00:52:49,470
I have been looking at myself
more than you ever will.

662
00:52:55,128 --> 00:52:57,086
What the fuck is your deal?

663
00:52:57,217 --> 00:52:59,219
I'm just trying to help you.

664
00:53:00,394 --> 00:53:03,919
I don't need your help, cunt!

665
00:53:09,273 --> 00:53:10,273
You know what?

666
00:53:12,841 --> 00:53:13,841
Good.

667
00:53:14,930 --> 00:53:17,672
The only reason that I am here

668
00:53:17,803 --> 00:53:21,241
is because your mom begged
me to come and check on you

669
00:53:21,372 --> 00:53:24,331
and make sure you didn't try
to fucking kill yourself again.

670
00:53:26,203 --> 00:53:28,484
I don't need to be a guest
star on your shitty video diary

671
00:53:28,596 --> 00:53:30,685
that nobody's gonna
fucking watch.

672
00:53:30,816 --> 00:53:31,936
I actually have a following.

673
00:53:32,034 --> 00:53:34,602
I actually help
people feel good.

674
00:53:34,733 --> 00:53:35,995
I'm not just... [snickering]

675
00:53:36,125 --> 00:53:39,825
I am not just sitting around
in this stupid fucking room

676
00:53:39,955 --> 00:53:41,218
starving myself

677
00:53:41,348 --> 00:53:43,568
and getting lifestyle tips
from the book of the dead.

678
00:53:45,265 --> 00:53:47,267
Who the fuck do
you think you are?

679
00:53:47,398 --> 00:53:49,661
Your whole entire fucking career

680
00:53:49,791 --> 00:53:52,229
is built on the backs
of people like Verasha,

681
00:53:52,359 --> 00:53:54,796
people with the fucking fortitude
to go out into the world

682
00:53:54,927 --> 00:53:56,755
and experience real shit.

683
00:53:56,885 --> 00:53:59,192
You, you bounce your tits
around doing some jumping jacks,

684
00:53:59,323 --> 00:54:01,126
and you think that you're
changing people's lives.

685
00:54:01,150 --> 00:54:02,630
Are you fucking kidding me?

686
00:54:02,761 --> 00:54:04,806
You consume other
people's cultures

687
00:54:04,937 --> 00:54:08,332
and then shit them back out
into leopard-neon spandex.

688
00:54:08,462 --> 00:54:10,072
Kenzi, you're a
fucking colonizer!

689
00:54:10,203 --> 00:54:13,424
- Oh my God!
- This is real.

690
00:54:13,554 --> 00:54:16,688
This is truth. This is my
heritage and I am living it.

691
00:54:19,343 --> 00:54:20,343
Oh...

692
00:54:21,214 --> 00:54:22,346
my fucking God!

693
00:54:24,086 --> 00:54:26,567
Anya, are you serious?

694
00:54:27,742 --> 00:54:28,961
Colonizer?

695
00:54:29,091 --> 00:54:31,659
You need a fucking Taco Bell.

696
00:54:32,530 --> 00:54:34,358
At least back when
you actually ate food.

697
00:54:35,402 --> 00:54:36,577
I mean, what?

698
00:54:36,708 --> 00:54:37,578
You seriously think that
your weird fucking grandma

699
00:54:37,709 --> 00:54:39,188
traveled the world?

700
00:54:40,189 --> 00:54:43,584
She probably never even
left this fucking house.

701
00:54:44,455 --> 00:54:49,111
Just some sad old lady
getting drunk on Vodka

702
00:54:49,242 --> 00:54:52,724
and making up stories because
her family abandoned her.

703
00:54:58,382 --> 00:54:59,992
Keep your fucking
Siberian bullshit.

704
00:55:02,255 --> 00:55:05,650
Fuck you, fuck your
grandma. Have a great life.

705
00:55:05,780 --> 00:55:07,826
I am done with this and
I am so done with you.

706
00:55:29,369 --> 00:55:30,529
And I am taking this with me.

707
00:55:30,588 --> 00:55:31,284
Hey!

708
00:55:31,415 --> 00:55:32,415
Get out!

709
00:55:35,157 --> 00:55:37,595
- What the fuck, Anya?
- Get out.

710
00:55:37,725 --> 00:55:38,725
Get out!

711
00:55:40,641 --> 00:55:45,429
You fucking psycho!
[door slams]

712
00:55:51,565 --> 00:55:53,654
[screams]

713
00:56:09,148 --> 00:56:11,846
[bones cracking]

714
00:56:28,602 --> 00:56:30,996
[eerie music]

715
00:57:03,376 --> 00:57:06,684
[Anya breathing heavily]

716
00:57:28,532 --> 00:57:31,709
[computer dialing tone]

717
00:57:33,798 --> 00:57:35,321
Anya, what is the
matter with you?

718
00:57:35,452 --> 00:57:36,714
Why haven't you called me back?

719
00:57:36,844 --> 00:57:39,064
Kenzi's mom said you
two got in a fight.

720
00:57:39,194 --> 00:57:42,937
Yeah, I'm sorry. I, I
meant to call you earlier.

721
00:57:43,068 --> 00:57:44,243
I just-

722
00:57:44,373 --> 00:57:45,612
I've been so worried about you.

723
00:57:45,636 --> 00:57:46,332
I almost called the police.

724
00:57:46,463 --> 00:57:48,856
Mom, I'm sorry. Okay?

725
00:57:50,554 --> 00:57:51,554
You look sick.

726
00:57:52,947 --> 00:57:54,601
I, I need help.

727
00:57:56,473 --> 00:57:58,823
Okay. Okay. I'll get the
first flight out there.

728
00:57:58,953 --> 00:58:01,347
No, mom, I need help

729
00:58:04,132 --> 00:58:05,438
translating something.

730
00:58:12,184 --> 00:58:14,229
- No.
- Mom, please.

731
00:58:14,360 --> 00:58:16,405
I said no.

732
00:58:16,536 --> 00:58:17,406
Please.

733
00:58:17,537 --> 00:58:18,537
Anya.

734
00:58:20,061 --> 00:58:21,236
Mom, please.

735
00:58:23,717 --> 00:58:26,111
I don't, I don't
know what I'm doing.

736
00:58:30,115 --> 00:58:31,195
What has she done to you?

737
00:58:32,291 --> 00:58:34,859
I, I don't know.
I don't know. And-

738
00:58:34,989 --> 00:58:38,340
Anya, this is why I never told
you about your grandmother.

739
00:58:41,039 --> 00:58:45,173
The day I heard Verasha died,
all I felt was happiness,

740
00:58:47,567 --> 00:58:49,613
because I knew she would
never come back for you.

741
00:58:49,743 --> 00:58:51,658
Jesus, mom.

742
00:58:51,789 --> 00:58:55,270
- Anya, come home, please.
- Okay.

743
00:58:58,535 --> 00:58:59,666
I am sorry, mom.

744
00:59:01,450 --> 00:59:04,715
I am so sorry that I
didn't listen to you,

745
00:59:07,761 --> 00:59:09,720
but I need you to
translate this for me.

746
00:59:12,026 --> 00:59:14,115
But I need you to
help me for once,

747
00:59:16,291 --> 00:59:21,122
because if I don't find
a way to finish this,

748
00:59:21,949 --> 00:59:25,257
then I will never escape it
and I can't keep running.

749
00:59:27,781 --> 00:59:32,133
So please, please tell
me what this says.

750
00:59:45,103 --> 00:59:46,103
Show me.

751
00:59:54,242 --> 00:59:55,242
So...

752
00:59:57,028 --> 00:59:58,595
she translated most of it

753
00:59:58,725 --> 01:00:02,599
and, and phonetized some
other places, but not this.

754
01:00:03,643 --> 01:00:07,604
And it looks like it's in
the same alphabet, I think.

755
01:00:09,214 --> 01:00:11,608
It might be just a
different dialect or...

756
01:00:11,738 --> 01:00:13,261
- Anya. Anya.
- What does it say?

757
01:00:14,349 --> 01:00:17,396
I, I can't, I can't say it.

758
01:00:17,526 --> 01:00:19,790
- Mom, please tell me.
- Anya.

759
01:00:19,920 --> 01:00:24,098
- Mom, please tell me.
- Anya, I can't say it.

760
01:00:24,229 --> 01:00:28,755
- It doesn't make
any sense - What?

761
01:00:28,886 --> 01:00:32,803
It's, it's, it's some
sort of ancient tongue.

762
01:00:32,933 --> 01:00:36,241
It's barely even Russian.
I don't know what this is.

763
01:00:38,591 --> 01:00:41,333
Anya. Anya, please come home.

764
01:01:18,805 --> 01:01:20,372
You fucking bitch.

765
01:01:21,503 --> 01:01:22,679
I've been lying to you

766
01:01:25,943 --> 01:01:27,858
because my grandmother
has been lying to me.

767
01:01:31,035 --> 01:01:35,604
You see this symbol, the
top of all the ritual pages?

768
01:01:36,649 --> 01:01:39,043
Yeah, I thought, I thought
that it was like a, a flourish

769
01:01:39,173 --> 01:01:40,522
or a signature or something.

770
01:01:40,653 --> 01:01:41,653
But...

771
01:01:43,351 --> 01:01:44,351
it's not.

772
01:01:47,138 --> 01:01:48,138
It's a fucking key

773
01:01:51,185 --> 01:01:53,666
to what's hidden in these pages.

774
01:01:56,364 --> 01:01:59,019
These aren't words of wisdom.

775
01:01:59,890 --> 01:02:03,589
It's fucking backwards
black magic bullshit.

776
01:02:05,069 --> 01:02:08,115
This was never meant
to cleanse my spirit.

777
01:02:08,246 --> 01:02:11,118
This was meant to
destroy my spirit.

778
01:02:12,772 --> 01:02:14,992
It was meant to
destroy my spirit

779
01:02:17,255 --> 01:02:18,473
and make room for hers.

780
01:02:24,784 --> 01:02:25,784
And I...

781
01:02:33,053 --> 01:02:36,404
followed blindly because it's
easier than facing myself.

782
01:02:48,286 --> 01:02:50,549
[screaming]

783
01:03:09,176 --> 01:03:11,570

784
01:03:24,409 --> 01:03:27,325
[deep heart beating]

785
01:03:32,765 --> 01:03:35,768
Verasha, please, please,
Verasha, you don't have,

786
01:03:35,899 --> 01:03:37,378
you don't have to do this.

787
01:03:37,509 --> 01:03:40,164
Please, please.
No, please, please.

788
01:03:41,295 --> 01:03:42,427
Please, please.

789
01:03:45,909 --> 01:03:50,696

music continues]

Hi Kenzi, this is Anya speaking.

800
01:04:40,006 --> 01:04:42,443
I can't tell you how sorry I
am for my behavior earlier.

801
01:04:44,054 --> 01:04:45,098
I feel so ashamed.

802
01:04:48,362 --> 01:04:49,842
To be perfectly honest with you,

803
01:04:51,539 --> 01:04:54,803
I think a lot of that anger
came from a place of jealousy.

804
01:04:57,197 --> 01:05:01,680
I mean, you're just so
worldly and wise and kind.

805
01:05:04,074 --> 01:05:05,162
And sometimes, sometimes,

806
01:05:07,599 --> 01:05:10,428
sometimes I feel
like I can't compete.

807
01:05:15,085 --> 01:05:16,279
There's this little
voice inside of me

808
01:05:16,303 --> 01:05:18,958
that just won't let be myself.

809
01:05:21,526 --> 01:05:23,136
And I just wanna
tell her to let go.

810
01:05:26,792 --> 01:05:27,792
It's okay.

811
01:05:29,447 --> 01:05:30,447
It's okay.

812
01:05:39,718 --> 01:05:42,808
But until then, I sincerely
hope you can forgive me.

813
01:05:43,940 --> 01:05:45,245
And as a sign of good faith,

814
01:05:45,376 --> 01:05:46,875
I would love to have you over
to record some more videos

815
01:05:46,899 --> 01:05:47,987
and bury the old hatchet.

816
01:05:52,644 --> 01:05:53,950
Wishing you wellness my friend.

817
01:05:56,039 --> 01:05:57,039
Namaste.

818
01:06:14,448 --> 01:06:17,538
[knocking at the door]

819
01:06:35,078 --> 01:06:36,470
Are you filming me?

820
01:06:37,732 --> 01:06:40,431
[Anya] Yes. Is that
all right with you?

821
01:06:41,867 --> 01:06:42,868
Yeah, sure.

822
01:06:46,176 --> 01:06:48,178
Holy shit, are you
okay? What happened?

823
01:06:49,266 --> 01:06:50,266
[Anya] Oh, this.

824
01:06:51,572 --> 01:06:54,836
I hit my head while I was
rearranging some furniture.

825
01:06:54,967 --> 01:06:56,055
It looks like it hurt.

826
01:06:57,361 --> 01:06:58,361
[Anya] I'm fine now.

827
01:07:01,408 --> 01:07:05,543
I'm sorry. I shouldn't
have said, I mean earlier.

828
01:07:09,590 --> 01:07:10,590
I'm sorry.

829
01:07:28,957 --> 01:07:31,134
[creaking]

830
01:07:35,790 --> 01:07:36,790
Do you wanna sit?

831
01:08:02,904 --> 01:08:06,343
I am sorry for
getting so heated.

832
01:08:06,473 --> 01:08:07,473
It's just...

833
01:08:09,389 --> 01:08:12,697
being this, this perfect person

834
01:08:12,827 --> 01:08:15,613
is just so fucking
stressful, you know?

835
01:08:17,963 --> 01:08:22,098
I completely understand.
And I'm sorry too.

836
01:08:24,491 --> 01:08:26,014
I shouldn't have
said those things.

837
01:08:30,454 --> 01:08:32,195
Are you sure you're okay?

838
01:08:35,372 --> 01:08:36,677
I feel fantastic.

839
01:08:38,897 --> 01:08:39,897
I truly do.

840
01:08:45,599 --> 01:08:46,599
I...

841
01:08:48,863 --> 01:08:50,126
I guess I have to thank you.

842
01:08:51,953 --> 01:08:53,303
- Is that so?
- Yeah.

843
01:08:55,131 --> 01:08:57,568
You know, I don't really agree

844
01:08:57,698 --> 01:09:00,092
with the way you handled things,

845
01:09:00,223 --> 01:09:02,877
and I was pretty
fucking upset with you.

846
01:09:04,314 --> 01:09:06,881
But what you said,

847
01:09:09,406 --> 01:09:10,450
it wasn't bullshit.

848
01:09:12,496 --> 01:09:17,501
We're all just borrowing,
stealing, I guess,

849
01:09:17,631 --> 01:09:19,459
just like taking
pieces of things

850
01:09:19,590 --> 01:09:21,679
and making them our identity

851
01:09:22,680 --> 01:09:24,725
without really thinking
about where they come from.

852
01:09:27,424 --> 01:09:28,424
And I guess,

853
01:09:32,472 --> 01:09:37,129
I guess I just don't really
know who I am without them.

854
01:09:40,306 --> 01:09:42,787
You're you. That's
all you can be.

855
01:09:50,055 --> 01:09:51,883
I mean, I put in the work.

856
01:09:52,013 --> 01:09:54,146
It's not like easy,

857
01:09:54,277 --> 01:09:58,281
but I'm not, you know,
special or whatever.

858
01:10:01,893 --> 01:10:02,893
But you are.

859
01:10:08,204 --> 01:10:09,640
How hard did you hit your head?

860
01:10:12,077 --> 01:10:14,645
[both giggling]

861
01:10:19,650 --> 01:10:21,304
I am glad you're here.

862
01:10:25,917 --> 01:10:27,048
I'm glad I am too.

863
01:10:35,796 --> 01:10:38,930
Okay, so what exactly
did you have in mind?

864
01:10:45,502 --> 01:10:46,894
It's a guided meditation.

865
01:10:48,331 --> 01:10:50,637
I practiced it on my
own a few nights ago,

866
01:10:50,768 --> 01:10:52,465
but it's supposed to be better

867
01:10:52,596 --> 01:10:54,989
when someone else
is guiding you.

868
01:10:56,426 --> 01:10:59,211
Cool. You, you
wanna do an intro?

869
01:11:00,952 --> 01:11:03,128
I recorded an
introduction earlier,

870
01:11:03,259 --> 01:11:06,087
but perhaps we can say "hello."

871
01:11:06,218 --> 01:11:09,395
Okay. Yeah. Cool. Kick it off.

872
01:11:16,750 --> 01:11:20,624
Welcome back everyone
to Mind Body Spirit.

873
01:11:22,495 --> 01:11:24,715
We have a familiar guest today.

874
01:11:24,845 --> 01:11:27,892
Hey guys, KenziFit here.

875
01:11:28,022 --> 01:11:30,155
I will be guiding you
through a meditation.

876
01:11:30,286 --> 01:11:32,592
And Kenzi here, will
be my first recipient.

877
01:11:36,553 --> 01:11:39,991
Find yourself in a
comfortable corpse pose.

878
01:11:41,514 --> 01:11:43,255
Whatever feels best to you.
- Okay.

879
01:11:54,962 --> 01:11:59,706
Allow your back body
to sink to the ground.

880
01:12:02,361 --> 01:12:04,450
[deep exhale]

881
01:12:04,581 --> 01:12:08,802
Let your belly rise
and fall with a breath.

882
01:12:11,370 --> 01:12:13,764
[deep exhale]

883
01:12:15,809 --> 01:12:18,986
Sink deeper with every exhale.

884
01:12:20,945 --> 01:12:23,339
[deep exhale]

885
01:12:30,128 --> 01:12:32,522
[deep exhale]

886
01:12:36,221 --> 01:12:37,221
In

887
01:12:41,313 --> 01:12:46,187
And out. [deep exhale]

888
01:12:47,188 --> 01:12:48,188
In...

889
01:12:52,324 --> 01:12:53,847
- Oh. Okay.
- It's okay.

890
01:12:57,111 --> 01:12:58,852
And as you relax,

891
01:12:58,983 --> 01:13:03,596
your partner will gently reach
your arms out to your sides,

892
01:13:06,817 --> 01:13:11,561
extending away from
your ribs, [deep exhale]

893
01:13:16,130 --> 01:13:18,306
allowing your breath to
fill into your lungs,

894
01:13:18,437 --> 01:13:22,876
reaching their full
capacity. [deep exhale]

895
01:13:25,792 --> 01:13:26,792
In

896
01:13:29,100 --> 01:13:31,624
And out. [deep exhale]

897
01:13:35,193 --> 01:13:37,108
Continue with this rhythm.

898
01:13:43,375 --> 01:13:45,769
[deep exhale]

899
01:13:49,294 --> 01:13:50,294
In

900
01:13:54,517 --> 01:13:55,909
And out. [deep exhale]

901
01:13:56,040 --> 01:13:57,040
This is really nice.

902
01:14:05,441 --> 01:14:07,051
So how long should I-

903
01:14:07,181 --> 01:14:09,749
[Kenzi shrieks]

904
01:14:09,880 --> 01:14:12,970
[heavy multiple thuds]

905
01:14:51,182 --> 01:14:54,968
[tense music with a heavy beat]

906
01:15:12,377 --> 01:15:14,684
[door slams]

907
01:15:21,908 --> 01:15:24,520
[sinister music]

908
01:15:45,105 --> 01:15:47,804
I am ready to
receive all of you.

909
01:15:52,330 --> 01:15:54,593
[quivering]

910
01:16:03,471 --> 01:16:05,561
[gasping]

911
01:16:17,181 --> 01:16:19,836
[bones cracking]

912
01:16:21,141 --> 01:16:23,404
[screaming]

913
01:16:59,527 --> 01:17:02,269
[sinister scream]

914
01:17:14,151 --> 01:17:17,154
[cellphone vibrating]

915
01:17:23,726 --> 01:17:28,078
- Hello?
- Anya? Jesus, are you okay?

916
01:17:28,208 --> 01:17:29,993
[Lenka] I have been
calling you nonstop.

917
01:17:30,123 --> 01:17:34,867
[Anya] Oh, don't worry.
I'm fine. I slept well.

918
01:17:36,260 --> 01:17:37,522
I feel rested now.

919
01:17:38,871 --> 01:17:40,003
[Lenka] That's a relief.

920
01:17:41,787 --> 01:17:43,963
It's, it's good to
hear your voice.

921
01:17:44,094 --> 01:17:47,053
[Anya] Hmm. It's good
to hear your voice too.

922
01:17:49,099 --> 01:17:50,927
[Lenka] What happened
with the journal?

923
01:17:53,103 --> 01:17:55,279
[Anya] Well, I put
that behind me.

924
01:17:55,409 --> 01:17:57,237
[Lenka] Oh, good.

925
01:17:58,848 --> 01:17:59,848
Good.

926
01:18:03,548 --> 01:18:05,158
Anya?

927
01:18:05,289 --> 01:18:10,207
[Anya] I was trying so
hard to be someone else

928
01:18:10,773 --> 01:18:12,383
that I finally found myself.

929
01:18:16,082 --> 01:18:18,911
I think it's time
I come home, Lenka.

930
01:18:22,393 --> 01:18:24,264
[Lenka] I look forward
to seeing you again.

931
01:18:27,050 --> 01:18:28,181
I love you, Anya.

932
01:18:37,408 --> 01:18:40,063
[sinister music]

933
01:18:48,985 --> 01:18:52,510
[heavy beat sinister music]

934
01:19:32,289 --> 01:19:36,597
[heavy beat sinister
music continues]
