Or we start with a misfire.

184
00:12:19,243 --> 00:12:20,411
Look at that sky.

185
00:12:22,038 --> 00:12:24,082
That's a mighty fine day
to be free, ain't it?

186
00:12:24,999 --> 00:12:26,417
Our own juke joint.

187
00:12:27,251 --> 00:12:28,920
For us, and by us.

188
00:12:29,295 --> 00:12:30,880
Just like we always wanted.

189
00:12:34,842 --> 00:12:36,469
Only chance we got if we split up.

190
00:12:37,428 --> 00:12:38,429
Well, who gon' watch the truck

191
00:12:38,596 --> 00:12:39,639
while I'm in there talking to the Chows?

192
00:12:39,806 --> 00:12:40,974
Nigga, just let 'em see it's you.

193
00:12:41,140 --> 00:12:42,350
We've been gone a long time, Stack.

194
00:12:42,517 --> 00:12:44,602
Seven years ain't long enough
to forget about us.

195
00:12:45,603 --> 00:12:46,604
All right.

196
00:12:47,939 --> 00:12:49,732
Watch this fool. Make sure
he don't get in no trouble.

197
00:12:50,233 --> 00:12:51,985
You big enough to take me now, huh?

198
00:12:52,151 --> 00:12:53,194
[Sammie] I'll do what I can.

199
00:12:53,361 --> 00:12:54,570
Nah, you'll do what you told.

200
00:12:55,530 --> 00:12:57,740
You keep your eyes open
for anybody staring too long.

201
00:12:57,907 --> 00:12:59,742
This nigga don't know how
to watch his own back.

202
00:13:01,744 --> 00:13:02,912
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

203
00:13:03,079 --> 00:13:04,580
- Be careful.
- I will.

204
00:13:08,334 --> 00:13:09,544
You with me.

205
00:13:10,253 --> 00:13:12,255
[groovy music playing]

206
00:13:21,931 --> 00:13:23,099
[engine starts]

207
00:14:01,679 --> 00:14:04,057
[indistinct chatter]

208
00:14:14,609 --> 00:14:15,610
Hey, little girl.

209
00:14:17,362 --> 00:14:18,446
Come here.

210
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:22,283
Where you from?

211
00:14:22,408 --> 00:14:23,451
Shelby.

212
00:14:23,618 --> 00:14:25,036
You heard of the Smokestack Twins?

213
00:14:25,203 --> 00:14:26,287
Of course.

214
00:14:26,454 --> 00:14:28,539
Good. I'm Smoke.

215
00:14:29,874 --> 00:14:31,751
No, no, no, now.
You're not in no trouble.

216
00:14:32,335 --> 00:14:34,003
See, I'm trying to put
some money in your pocket.

217
00:14:35,630 --> 00:14:37,840
See, I'mma need you to come
sit in this truck right here.

218
00:14:39,050 --> 00:14:41,427
And if somebody come
and look a little too long...

219
00:14:41,594 --> 00:14:43,221
I want you to lean
on this horn, all right?

220
00:14:43,388 --> 00:14:44,389
Can you do that for me?

221
00:14:45,974 --> 00:14:46,975
Can you tell time?

222
00:14:47,850 --> 00:14:49,269
I'mma pay you ten cents

223
00:14:49,435 --> 00:14:50,645
for every minute that I'm gone.

224
00:14:51,396 --> 00:14:53,273
- Will that work for you?
- Yes, sir.

225
00:14:53,439 --> 00:14:54,565
No, ma'am.

226
00:14:54,941 --> 00:14:56,484
See, we talkin' numbers now.

227
00:14:56,651 --> 00:14:59,570
And numbers always gotta be in
conversation with each other.

228
00:14:59,737 --> 00:15:00,780
You understand?

229
00:15:00,989 --> 00:15:02,573
You gotta negotiate.

230
00:15:02,740 --> 00:15:05,660
Now, ten cents just won't work for you.

231
00:15:06,411 --> 00:15:07,870
Talk another number back to me.

232
00:15:08,413 --> 00:15:09,414
Fitty cent.

233
00:15:09,580 --> 00:15:11,916
Twenty cents. Best I can do.

234
00:15:12,083 --> 00:15:13,584
We got a deal?

235
00:15:13,751 --> 00:15:15,211
Good. Jump in.

236
00:15:19,966 --> 00:15:21,551
Remember, lean on that horn.

237
00:15:43,573 --> 00:15:45,199
You not little Lisa, is you?

238
00:15:45,366 --> 00:15:46,784
Guilty as charged.

- [Sarah] Mornin'!

240
00:15:48,119 --> 00:15:50,246

241
00:15:51,164 --> 00:15:52,165

242
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:54,792
Bo Chow.

243
00:15:54,959 --> 00:15:57,128
Look what the damn cat dragged in.

244
00:16:01,174 --> 00:16:02,300
What can I do for you?

245
00:16:02,467 --> 00:16:03,676
We throwin' a big event tonight.

[Bo] Y'all do good up in Chicago?

249
00:16:07,347 --> 00:16:08,473
I heard about some of them

250
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:09,807
casinos up there. Y'all hit it big?

251
00:16:13,311 --> 00:16:15,647
We hit. Just not the way you thinking.

252
00:16:16,147 --> 00:16:17,398
What kind of way?

253
00:16:17,565 --> 00:16:18,566

00:16:29,702 --> 00:16:31,079
[thief] I'm trying to make sure
they ain't watchin' that shit.

260
00:16:31,245 --> 00:16:32,246
[Terry] Man, just get

Terry? Boy, how you been?

270
00:16:49,097 --> 00:16:50,932
I was doin' better

271
00:16:51,099 --> 00:16:52,517
Why in the hell you trying

272
00:16:52,684 --> 00:16:53,893
This your truck?

273
00:16:54,519 --> 00:16:55,520
I didn't know it was your truck.

274
00:16:55,687 --> 00:16:56,688
- I swear, Smoke.
- Bullshit.

275
00:16:56,854 --> 00:16:57,855
I told you it was his.

276

Wait, wait, Smoke. I thought,
I thought she was lyin'.

00:17:00,108 --> 00:17:02,026
Y'all was supposed to be

00:17:04,070 --> 00:17:05,280
Yeah, we back now.

279

Goddamn! What you do that for?

280
00:17:15,872 --> 00:17:17,208
Can't have some nigga talkin' about

00:17:17,374 --> 00:17:19,002
how he almost robbed the Twins.

282
00:17:19,168 --> 00:17:20,253
Not without a limp to show for it.

283
00:17:20,420 --> 00:17:21,963
- Well, who gon' patch me up?
- [thief] Shit!

284
00:17:22,130 --> 00:17:23,131
I ain't got no money.

285

Lick that.

347
00:19:52,363 --> 00:19:55,158
Not too hard. Not too soft, either.

348
00:19:55,491 --> 00:19:57,285
You ever had a scoop of
that ice cream from downtown?

349
00:19:57,493 --> 00:19:58,494

Hey, how fast this thing drive?

354

Why? You wanna drive?

356
00:20:10,173 --> 00:20:11,174
Come on, you know I wanna drive.

357
00:20:11,341 --> 00:20:13,343

00:20:13,509 --> 00:20:14,802
- On the way back.
- All right, all right.

359
00:20:17,138 --> 00:20:18,306

Go on ahead.

Open up this door,

He was. I checked his pulse.

1657
01:29:13,770 --> 01:29:15,563
Then what the fuck
is he doin' talkin' to us?

1658
01:29:15,730 --> 01:29:18,775
But this is good, right?
Means he's okay.

Pickled garlic.

1689
01:30:35,184 --> 01:30:36,394
These ain't haints.

1690
01:30:37,645 --> 01:30:38,646
They're vampires.

01:30:43,192 --> 01:30:45,820
[Grace] Bo's out there.
We gotta go get him.

1692
01:30:45,987 --> 01:30:47,155
I'm the one who sent him out there.

1693

Y'all ain't gonna keep me
from my husband.

...silver, and holy water.

1704

Shit might not kill 'em,
but it'll slow 'em down.

1705
01:31:18,853 --> 01:31:21,147
How could it move
and sound like Stack...

1706
01:31:22,023 --> 01:31:23,024
if it ain't Stack?

1707
01:31:23,399 --> 01:31:24,984
I only ever heard stories.

1708

I ain't never come across them myself.

1709
01:31:26,819 --> 01:31:28,237
[Pearline] What stories you heard?

1710
01:31:28,404 --> 01:31:31,616
How haints work. They switch
places with the soul of a man.

1711
01:31:33,242 --> 01:31:34,661

The soul gets stuck in the body.

1715
01:31:41,125 --> 01:31:42,669
Can't rejoin the ancestors.

1716
01:31:42,835 --> 01:31:45,171
Cursed to live here with all this hate.

Can't even feel the warmth of a sunrise.

1718
01:31:51,928 --> 01:31:54,514
Okay then. Can we bring him back?

1719
01:31:54,889 --> 01:31:56,641

that made him this way...

even if the one
that made them is killed.

1723
01:32:03,189 --> 01:32:04,732
The best thing we can do for him

1724
01:32:04,899 --> 01:32:06,401
is free his spirit from this curse.

1725
01:32:06,985 --> 01:32:08,653
They gotta be killed, one by one.

1726
01:32:08,820 --> 01:32:10,238
And how the hell do we do that?

It's 'cause of me.

My daddy told me.

He said the Devil was comin'
on account of my music.

1736
01:32:33,136 --> 01:32:35,722
I had a gal once, vampire.

1737

She was light skinneded, too.

1738

Devil done came for me plenty of times.

1743
