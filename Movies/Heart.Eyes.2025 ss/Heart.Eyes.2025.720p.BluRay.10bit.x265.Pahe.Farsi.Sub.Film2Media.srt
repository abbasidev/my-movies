1
00:00:56,681 --> 00:00:57,806
Patrick.

2
00:00:57,807 --> 00:00:58,974
Adeline.

3
00:00:58,975 --> 00:01:02,770
This is going to be the best
Valentine's Day ever.

4
00:01:03,479 --> 00:01:04,480
This place...

5
00:01:06,399 --> 00:01:07,817
it's just so gorge.

6
00:01:08,442 --> 00:01:09,818
Of course it is, babe.

7
00:01:09,819 --> 00:01:11,237
- You picked it!
- I picked it!

8
00:01:18,286 --> 00:01:19,287
Oh.

9
00:01:19,495 --> 00:01:21,914
Mmm. Mmm.

10
00:01:23,124 --> 00:01:24,292
Mmm.

11
00:01:25,793 --> 00:01:26,794
Mmm?

12
00:01:30,214 --> 00:01:31,215
What the hell?

13
00:01:35,803 --> 00:01:38,054
I told you
not to put it in my food.

14
00:01:38,055 --> 00:01:41,392
- Oh, shit. I'm sorry. Sorry, I--
- It's fine. Keep going.

15
00:01:46,522 --> 00:01:47,939
Adeline Delilah Garrett.

16
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:49,566
You're smart.

17
00:01:49,567 --> 00:01:50,775
You're beautiful.

18
00:01:50,776 --> 00:01:53,195
And perhaps
most important of all,

19
00:01:53,196 --> 00:01:54,739
you make me think.

20
00:01:55,865 --> 00:01:59,159
You're my person and I can't
imagine my life without you.

21
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:00,453
Will you marry me?

22
00:02:01,245 --> 00:02:03,706
Yes. A million times, yes!

23
00:02:24,268 --> 00:02:26,437
Why are you
calling me right now?

24
00:02:27,688 --> 00:02:28,855
I didn't get it.

25
00:02:28,856 --> 00:02:31,024
<i>What the fuck do you mean
you didn't get it?</i>

26
00:02:31,025 --> 00:02:32,317
Yeah, I'm sorry, dude.

27
00:02:32,318 --> 00:02:34,361
There was a couple
of sun flares and like...

28
00:02:34,362 --> 00:02:36,530
<i>Um, could you maybe
do it again? Or...</i>

29
00:02:36,531 --> 00:02:37,864
Why, yes.

30
00:02:37,865 --> 00:02:39,950
Let me re-propose
to my fucking girlfriend

31
00:02:39,951 --> 00:02:41,452
so you can do your job right.

32
00:02:42,703 --> 00:02:45,455
- Technically she's your fiancée.
<i>- Don't get cute with me.</i>

33
00:02:45,456 --> 00:02:48,835
Do it right this time
or I'll fucking end you...

34
00:02:49,794 --> 00:02:51,503
- on Yelp.
<i>- Okay, cool, thanks.</i>

35
00:02:51,504 --> 00:02:54,632
I'll talk to you later.
I'm not even on Yelp, dick.

36
00:02:59,804 --> 00:03:03,348
Uh... Speech, speech, speech.
Lovey, lovey-dovey.

37
00:03:03,349 --> 00:03:04,433
And...

38
00:03:05,810 --> 00:03:06,893
Will you marry me?

39
00:03:06,894 --> 00:03:09,397
Yes. A million times, yes.

40
00:03:15,278 --> 00:03:16,904
Just one second.

41
00:03:20,032 --> 00:03:22,158
Give me that. Hello?

42
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:23,910
<i>Nico the Photo Guy.
Leave a message.</i>

43
00:03:23,911 --> 00:03:25,872
Are you fucking kidding... me?

44
00:04:03,034 --> 00:04:04,035
No!

45
00:04:34,482 --> 00:04:35,483
Hello?

46
00:04:40,196 --> 00:04:41,697
You listen here, asshole.

47
00:04:45,076 --> 00:04:47,662
<i>I have been planning this day
my whole life...</i>

48
00:04:49,247 --> 00:04:51,040
<i>and you fucking killed him!</i>

49
00:04:52,834 --> 00:04:54,752
You messed with the wrong bride.

50
00:04:56,170 --> 00:04:57,171
You hear me?

51
00:04:58,130 --> 00:05:00,049
You messed with the wrong fu--

52
00:05:26,826 --> 00:05:28,785
Whoa, ma'am, you can't be here.
What are you doing?

53
00:05:28,786 --> 00:05:30,955
- He's trying to kill me!
- Please, just calm down.

54
00:05:33,207 --> 00:05:35,376
Hey, buddy, you wanna tell me
what's going on?

55
00:05:37,545 --> 00:05:39,839
Wait. Stop!
Drop the knife, asshole!

56
00:05:45,511 --> 00:05:48,472
Somebody! Please!

57
00:06:17,335 --> 00:06:18,377
Shoot.

58
00:07:06,843 --> 00:07:08,761
Take that, you motherfucker!

59
00:07:09,971 --> 00:07:10,972
Go away!

60
00:07:12,473 --> 00:07:13,558
You go away!

61
00:07:16,018 --> 00:07:17,019
You go away!

62
00:07:17,854 --> 00:07:18,855
You go away!

63
00:07:26,904 --> 00:07:27,905
No.

64
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:31,617
No, no, no, no, no, no, no...

65
00:07:32,618 --> 00:07:34,619
No, no, no, no, no. Please!

66
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:36,122
Hey! Hey!

67
00:07:38,791 --> 00:07:39,792
No!

68
00:07:47,383 --> 00:07:48,384
No!

69
00:07:51,429 --> 00:07:52,430
No!

70
00:07:53,222 --> 00:07:55,349
No!

71
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:52,113
<i>It's Valentine's Day</i>

72
00:08:52,114 --> 00:08:54,867
<i>and the nation
is once again on high alert.</i>

73
00:08:56,452 --> 00:08:59,120
{\an8}For the past two years,
a masked maniac

74
00:08:59,121 --> 00:09:00,830
{\an8}<i>known as
the Heart Eyes Killer...</i>

75
00:09:00,831 --> 00:09:04,334
{\an8}...or HEK, as authorities
call him for short,

76
00:09:04,335 --> 00:09:06,711
{\an8}has emerged on a day
meant for romance

77
00:09:06,712 --> 00:09:09,339
{\an8}to target, hunt
and brutally kill couples.

78
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:11,967
{\an8}HEK seems to target cities
at random.

79
00:09:11,968 --> 00:09:13,343
{\an8}<i>From a blood-soaked rampage</i>

80
00:09:13,344 --> 00:09:14,928
{\an8}<i>in the Boston area
two years ago...</i>

81
00:09:14,929 --> 00:09:17,055
{\an8}...as well as a second
killing spree,

82
00:09:17,056 --> 00:09:20,058
{\an8}which left several dead
in Philadelphia just last year.

83
00:09:20,059 --> 00:09:23,061
{\an8}Even though he's after
couples in love,

84
00:09:23,062 --> 00:09:25,272
{\an8}let me be perfectly
clear about this...

85
00:09:25,273 --> 00:09:29,402
He will kill anyone
who gets in his way.

86
00:09:30,653 --> 00:09:33,029
{\an8}...leaving Americans
once again plagued with anxiety

87
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:35,115
{\an8}on Cupid's holiday
asking the question...

88
00:09:35,116 --> 00:09:38,202
{\an8}Where will the Heart Eyes Killer
strike next?

89
00:09:41,998 --> 00:09:44,416
{\an8}<i>Do you expect
the Heart Eyes Killer</i>

90
00:09:44,417 --> 00:09:46,501
{\an8}to kill your
Valentine's Day plans?

91
00:09:46,502 --> 00:09:48,795
{\an8}Who the hell
makes Valentine's Day plans?

92
00:09:48,796 --> 00:09:50,505
{\an8}Yeah, this holiday sucks ass, dude.

93
00:09:50,506 --> 00:09:52,048
{\an8}- Literally.
- Fuck Valentine...

94
00:09:52,049 --> 00:09:53,717
{\an8}I ain't even low-key scared.

95
00:09:53,718 --> 00:09:56,178
{\an8}The HEK ain't got nothin' on me.
You know, 'cause I--

96
00:09:56,179 --> 00:09:58,139
{\an8}Shut up, Dylan.
You're afraid of the dark.

97
00:10:00,266 --> 00:10:01,350
{\an8}No, I don't.

98
00:10:04,352 --> 00:10:06,520
<i>- The Heart Eyes Killer--
- So glad I'm single.</i>

99
00:10:06,521 --> 00:10:08,606
<i>- I'm gonna celebrate inside.
- That dude hunts you.</i>

100
00:10:08,607 --> 00:10:11,192
<i>...rubbing your shitty PDA
all up in our face--</i>

101
00:10:11,193 --> 00:10:12,484
<i>He only kills straight people,
I think.</i>

102
00:10:12,485 --> 00:10:15,529
<i>Whether you're with a partner
or looking for love,</i>

103
00:10:15,530 --> 00:10:18,241
<i>stay vigilant
this Valentine's Day.</i>

104
00:10:38,553 --> 00:10:39,554
Shit!

105
00:10:42,724 --> 00:10:44,808
- Nice one, dipshits.
- Got a cappuccino here.

106
00:10:44,809 --> 00:10:46,936
Hope Cupid
shoots you in the dick.

107
00:10:46,937 --> 00:10:48,812
Caramel soy latte for Monica!

108
00:10:48,813 --> 00:10:50,982
- Oh, that's me.
- Okay, yeah. There.

109
00:10:52,984 --> 00:10:54,401
Why do you look so stressed?

110
00:10:54,402 --> 00:10:56,654
Is it 'cause you're single again
on Valentine's Day?

111
00:10:56,655 --> 00:10:59,573
No, I'm... I'm stressed because
Crystal just called

112
00:10:59,574 --> 00:11:01,659
an all-hands meeting
and the subject of her email

113
00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:03,202
literally says
"Ally's Campaign."

114
00:11:03,203 --> 00:11:04,620
- Hmm. I saw that.
- So, I'm fucked.

115
00:11:04,621 --> 00:11:06,288
Okay, worst-case scenario,

116
00:11:06,289 --> 00:11:09,166
you get fired and you never work
another day in your life.

117
00:11:09,167 --> 00:11:12,127
Worst-case scenario, Crystal
wears my skin as a pantsuit.

118
00:11:12,128 --> 00:11:14,380
Best-case scenario,
you got nice skin though.

119
00:11:14,381 --> 00:11:15,506
Boop.

120
00:11:15,507 --> 00:11:17,007
You know what? Whatever.

121
00:11:17,008 --> 00:11:19,134
If you go down,
I'll go down with you. Okay?

122
00:11:19,135 --> 00:11:20,553
We'll Thelma and Louise
this shit.

123
00:11:20,554 --> 00:11:22,054
Large iced blended Americano

124
00:11:22,055 --> 00:11:24,599
with oat milk,
two honey, one sugar.

125
00:11:26,810 --> 00:11:28,435
Sorry, are you sure
that's yours?

126
00:11:28,436 --> 00:11:31,480
Yes, that is definitely mine.

127
00:11:31,481 --> 00:11:34,358
No one else would order
a large iced blended Americano

128
00:11:34,359 --> 00:11:36,986
with oat milk,
two honey, one sugar.

129
00:11:36,987 --> 00:11:39,489
Sugar. Yeah. Look at that. Wow.

130
00:11:40,365 --> 00:11:41,908
Guess we're coffee mates.

131
00:11:43,285 --> 00:11:45,202
- Nice dad joke.
- Thanks.

132
00:11:45,203 --> 00:11:46,662
I thought I was the only one
in the world

133
00:11:46,663 --> 00:11:48,414
with the most obnoxious
coffee order.

134
00:11:48,415 --> 00:11:50,040
It's a pretty common
order actually.

135
00:11:50,041 --> 00:11:51,459
Can you guys move? We're busy.

136
00:11:52,252 --> 00:11:53,253
Yes.

137
00:11:54,671 --> 00:11:55,672
He's hot!

138
00:11:59,509 --> 00:12:01,886
Hey, can I interest you
in one of these guys?

139
00:12:01,887 --> 00:12:04,346
Oh, no, I'm okay. Thanks.
I carry my own.

140
00:12:04,347 --> 00:12:06,807
- Oh. Metal straw.
- I hate paper straws.

141
00:12:06,808 --> 00:12:09,185
They just turn into mush
in, like, three seconds.

142
00:12:09,186 --> 00:12:11,854
Yeah, no. I totally get
what you're saying.

143
00:12:11,855 --> 00:12:14,064
Let's put all the coffee
in a plastic cup,

144
00:12:14,065 --> 00:12:16,942
but, hey, as long as the straw
is paper, planet saved.

145
00:12:16,943 --> 00:12:18,819
Planet saved.

146
00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:21,780
- Uh, sugar though. Want one?
- Yeah.

147
00:12:21,781 --> 00:12:22,865
A little slow poison

148
00:12:22,866 --> 00:12:23,949
- for the pancreas. Oh.
- Oh.

149
00:12:23,950 --> 00:12:25,534
- Ooh!
- Oh!

150
00:12:25,535 --> 00:12:28,495
- I'm sorry. No, I'm--
- I'm sorry. No, I'm-- Sorry.

151
00:12:28,496 --> 00:12:31,081
- I got it. It's okay.
- No, it's totally--

152
00:12:31,082 --> 00:12:32,625
- Fucking Jesus Murphy!
- Oh, Shit!

153
00:12:32,626 --> 00:12:33,792
Oh, my God. Are you okay?

154
00:12:33,793 --> 00:12:36,045
- Yeah. Am I?
- Oh, my God. You're bleeding!

155
00:12:36,046 --> 00:12:38,506
- Here. Shit. Uh--
- Oh-- Thank you for that.

156
00:12:38,507 --> 00:12:40,966
Bye. Um, I'm gonna go.
I'll see you at work, Mon.

157
00:12:40,967 --> 00:12:42,677
Sorry.
She's getting fired today.

158
00:12:43,553 --> 00:12:46,555
<i>Exactly one year
after a Valentine's Day massacre</i>

in a nightmare.

165
00:13:01,863 --> 00:13:04,657
{\an8}Chief Hartley, is this the work
of the Heart Eyes Killer?

166
00:13:04,658 --> 00:13:06,367
{\an8}That's not confirmed
at this point,

167
00:13:06,368 --> 00:13:08,410
{\an8}but given the pattern
of targeting couples

168
00:13:08,411 --> 00:13:11,038
{\an8}on Valentine's Day,
we suspect it's the work of HEK.

169
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:13,123
{\an8}What do you have to say
to all those couples out there

170
00:13:13,124 --> 00:13:15,418
{\an8}planning to celebrate
Valentine's Day?

171
00:13:16,211 --> 00:13:17,212
{\an8}Stay home.

172
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:19,881
{\an8}Well.

173
00:13:22,509 --> 00:13:23,927
This is quite a pickle.

174
00:13:29,474 --> 00:13:33,435
Why didn't a single one of you

175
00:13:33,436 --> 00:13:36,605
tell me that there is a maniac

176
00:13:36,606 --> 00:13:39,108
running around
slaughtering people

177
00:13:39,109 --> 00:13:42,444
on Valentine's Day
these last couple years?

178
00:13:42,445 --> 00:13:43,863
Tommy?

179
00:13:43,864 --> 00:13:47,867
Not a single one of you.

180
00:13:47,868 --> 00:13:51,120
This campaign
is certainly ill-timed.

181
00:13:51,121 --> 00:13:52,831
Wouldn't you say so, missy?

182
00:13:53,874 --> 00:13:56,251
Uh... Um...

183
00:13:58,044 --> 00:13:59,712
- I mean--
- You know, Crystal,

184
00:13:59,713 --> 00:14:01,547
how you always tell us

185
00:14:01,548 --> 00:14:03,883
that relevance is really
important in our pitches?

186
00:14:03,884 --> 00:14:09,263
Well, I personally believe that
Ally's campaign is very "now."

187
00:14:09,264 --> 00:14:11,182
Monica, thank you so much.

188
00:14:11,183 --> 00:14:13,435
If you could do me a huge favor.
Shut the fuck up.

189
00:14:15,562 --> 00:14:16,563
Tommy?

190
00:14:53,099 --> 00:14:57,269
"Wow. Profiting off the death
of couples to sell rings."

191
00:14:57,270 --> 00:14:58,687
"Speechless."

192
00:14:58,688 --> 00:15:01,065
- "This is disgusting."
- I'll say.

193
00:15:01,066 --> 00:15:02,900
"What did I just watch?"

194
00:15:02,901 --> 00:15:04,235
"Straight-up tacky."

195
00:15:04,236 --> 00:15:08,531
"Someone find out who made this
and dox their ignorant ass."

196
00:15:08,532 --> 00:15:10,741
- I mean, it just... it goes on.
- I'm sure it does.

197
00:15:10,742 --> 00:15:13,078
Ally, I'm worried
about your safety.

198
00:15:15,330 --> 00:15:17,373
Gee, thanks, Tommy.

199
00:15:17,374 --> 00:15:20,209
How many people has this
heart-shaped asshole killed?

200
00:15:20,210 --> 00:15:22,545
I think, like, a lot.

201
00:15:22,546 --> 00:15:23,755
A lot?

202
00:15:25,382 --> 00:15:30,177
You built a nationwide campaign
around romance ending in death?

203
00:15:30,178 --> 00:15:31,720
Well, you approved it.

204
00:15:31,721 --> 00:15:33,889
Because I trusted you.

205
00:15:33,890 --> 00:15:35,850
I'm gonna need a new campaign.

206
00:15:35,851 --> 00:15:39,229
- Okay. Um, no problem. I'll--
- Jay, get in here.

207
00:15:40,355 --> 00:15:42,064
Jay? Who's Jay?

208
00:15:42,065 --> 00:15:43,733
Thank you very much.

209
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:46,318
No way.

210
00:15:46,319 --> 00:15:48,571
That's the guy whose nose you
smashed

211
00:15:48,572 --> 00:15:50,281
- in at the coffee shop.
- Mon, sit down.

212
00:15:50,282 --> 00:15:52,783
Jay Simmonds, everybody.
This is Jay Simmonds.

213
00:15:52,784 --> 00:15:54,326
Who is Jay Simmonds?
Well, I'll tell you.

214
00:15:54,327 --> 00:15:58,122
Jay Simmonds is the former
CCD of BMY New York.

215
00:15:58,123 --> 00:16:02,209
He is the youngest freelancer
to win a Clio Award

216
00:16:02,210 --> 00:16:04,378
for his viral
romantic campaigns.

217
00:16:04,379 --> 00:16:09,091
Everything from fancy cars
to luxury chocolates.

218
00:16:09,092 --> 00:16:11,302
And, he has then earned himself

219
00:16:11,303 --> 00:16:15,055
a nice little moniker
of "Consumer Cupid."

220
00:16:15,056 --> 00:16:16,724
That is Jay Simmonds,

221
00:16:16,725 --> 00:16:17,808
and I'll tell you what.

222
00:16:17,809 --> 00:16:20,436
When I realized how far up
shit's creek

223
00:16:20,437 --> 00:16:22,229
Ally here had paddled us,

224
00:16:22,230 --> 00:16:24,440
I knew I needed
some reinforcements.

225
00:16:24,441 --> 00:16:26,610
And thank Baby Jesus.

226
00:16:27,277 --> 00:16:29,528
Now, he's gotta leave
and push off tomorrow

227
00:16:29,529 --> 00:16:32,531
and skedaddle,
so he's on the clock.

228
00:16:32,532 --> 00:16:34,200
Jay. Everybody, Jay!

229
00:16:34,201 --> 00:16:36,869
Thank you for the lovely
flattery, Crystal.

230
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:38,496
I appreciate it. Um...

231
00:16:39,873 --> 00:16:41,207
Listen, as I understand it,

232
00:16:41,208 --> 00:16:43,542
we've experienced
some turbulence as of late,

233
00:16:43,543 --> 00:16:47,213
but it's all about how you land
the plane that matters, so...

234
00:16:47,214 --> 00:16:48,840
we will get through this...

235
00:16:50,133 --> 00:16:51,134
together.

236
00:16:56,097 --> 00:16:58,724
- What the hell was that?
- I got a match.

237
00:16:58,725 --> 00:17:00,852
Oh, for fuck sakes.

238
00:17:04,272 --> 00:17:07,442
We're gonna get married.
I can feel it.

239
00:17:10,569 --> 00:17:11,905
That's your boyfriend?

240
00:17:12,864 --> 00:17:13,989
Yeah, he will be.

241
00:17:13,990 --> 00:17:16,742
He's an actual firefighter
who loves puppies.

242
00:17:19,788 --> 00:17:22,539
You see?
That's why you're still single.

243
00:17:22,540 --> 00:17:24,041
You know what you need, Shaw?

244
00:17:26,670 --> 00:17:28,004
You need a real man.

245
00:17:29,548 --> 00:17:31,675
One that's willing to make
the first move.

246
00:17:35,095 --> 00:17:38,098
<i>Come on, detectives.
You're gonna love this.</i>

247
00:17:39,432 --> 00:17:40,433
Check it out.

248
00:17:41,852 --> 00:17:43,562
What is that, a wedding band?

249
00:17:44,020 --> 00:17:45,688
Could it be one of the victim's?

250
00:17:45,689 --> 00:17:46,982
Unlikely.

251
00:17:50,443 --> 00:17:53,738
The initials engraved
on the inside... JS.

252
00:17:54,406 --> 00:17:56,533
Doesn't match
either of the deceased.

253
00:18:08,086 --> 00:18:10,462
What kind
of an animal would do this?

254
00:18:10,463 --> 00:18:15,301
Probably some incel virgin troll
living in his mommy's basement.

255
00:18:15,302 --> 00:18:16,595
Assuming it's a man.

256
00:18:17,888 --> 00:18:20,264
What about the girl
who never got asked to prom?

257
00:18:20,265 --> 00:18:21,682
The-- The love-scorned woman

258
00:18:21,683 --> 00:18:24,310
who got cheated on
one too many times

259
00:18:24,311 --> 00:18:26,353
and just snapped.

260
00:18:26,354 --> 00:18:27,606
Oh, fuck.

261
00:18:28,815 --> 00:18:30,983
Oh. Yes. He replied.

262
00:18:30,984 --> 00:18:32,234
The gay fireman?

263
00:18:32,235 --> 00:18:34,153
No, no. This guy works in tech.

264
00:18:34,154 --> 00:18:37,406
- Shaw's got a fetish for betas.
- I don't have a fetish.

265
00:18:37,407 --> 00:18:39,325
Everybody's got a fetish.

266
00:18:39,326 --> 00:18:42,329
Gentlemen, this is more
than just a simple murder.

267
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:44,581
It's a...

268
00:18:48,084 --> 00:18:49,085
...kink.

269
00:18:49,503 --> 00:18:52,463
That's the understatement
of the fucking year.

270
00:18:52,464 --> 00:18:54,507
How do you know for sure
it's HEK?

271
00:18:54,508 --> 00:18:56,051
Here you go, Detective.

272
00:18:58,803 --> 00:19:00,095
'Cause this is the last thing

273
00:19:00,096 --> 00:19:01,932
the wedding photographer
ever saw.

274
00:19:05,268 --> 00:19:07,478
Heart Eyes
has come to our city, boys.

275
00:19:07,479 --> 00:19:08,896
And they've got
another ten hours

276
00:19:08,897 --> 00:19:10,982
of Valentine's Day left to kill.

277
00:19:16,530 --> 00:19:18,740
Excuse me.
What in hell are you doing?

278
00:19:19,407 --> 00:19:22,785
What do you mean? You just fired
me in front of the whole team.

279
00:19:22,786 --> 00:19:25,538
Fired you? I got six more months
on your contract.

280
00:19:25,539 --> 00:19:28,999
I intend to squeeze every single
last drop out of you.

281
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,168
Okay. Great. So what
am I supposed to do?

282
00:19:31,169 --> 00:19:33,796
Get him coffee
while he lands the plane?

283
00:19:33,797 --> 00:19:36,674
No. You're gonna
turn in a sizzling,

284
00:19:36,675 --> 00:19:39,927
sexy, seductive, blockbuster

285
00:19:39,928 --> 00:19:41,470
Crystal Cane campaign.

286
00:19:41,471 --> 00:19:44,558
And if you don't, I'll kill you.

287
00:19:48,061 --> 00:19:50,020
I'm kidding. I won't.
I'll blacklist you, though.

288
00:19:50,021 --> 00:19:51,480
I won't kill you.

289
00:19:51,481 --> 00:19:52,566
I mean, maybe.

290
00:19:53,316 --> 00:19:54,317
But no.

291
00:19:54,985 --> 00:19:55,986
But would I?

292
00:19:58,655 --> 00:20:00,990
<i>"Whoever made this,
I hope you get</i>

293
00:20:00,991 --> 00:20:03,784
"murdered and canceled.
Not in that order."

294
00:20:03,785 --> 00:20:05,327
"Hashtag do better."

295
00:20:05,328 --> 00:20:07,371
"As someone who may die someday,

00:20:07,372 --> 00:20:08,956

"to be tone-deaf

298
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:13,461
Wow, people are fucking dumb.

Hey, Ally?

304
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:29,978
- Yeah?
- Howdy.

305
00:20:31,438 --> 00:20:32,813
Jay? Wha--

306
00:20:32,814 --> 00:20:35,816
This is the women's bathroom,
dude. You can't be in here.

307
00:20:35,817 --> 00:20:38,737
Technically, it is a unisex
bathroom, but...

308
00:20:39,571 --> 00:20:40,572
can we talk?

309
00:20:43,783 --> 00:20:45,410
- Hi.
- Hi.

310
00:20:45,911 --> 00:20:46,912
I'm...

311
00:20:48,413 --> 00:20:50,206
I am really sorry about earlier.

312
00:20:50,207 --> 00:20:52,458
Oh, no, it's totally fine.

313
00:20:52,459 --> 00:20:54,460
Sorry to stalk and run,

314
00:20:54,461 --> 00:20:56,337
but I'm trying
to make this yoga class

315
00:20:56,338 --> 00:20:58,255
that starts in, like, an hour.

316
00:20:58,256 --> 00:21:00,007
You serious? Yoga?

317
00:21:00,008 --> 00:21:01,092
Mmm-hmm.

318
00:21:01,927 --> 00:21:04,053
Aren't we supposed
to be saving the company?

319
00:21:04,054 --> 00:21:07,515
Yes, and we will.
Just after yoga.

320
00:21:07,516 --> 00:21:10,101
I booked us a table at L'oie.

321
00:21:10,977 --> 00:21:13,354
We get inspired,
talk about the campaign.

322
00:21:13,355 --> 00:21:16,190
You realize that
it's Valentine's Day, right?

323
00:21:16,191 --> 00:21:18,234
Oh, that's right.

324
00:21:18,235 --> 00:21:20,278
You probably got plans,
don't you?

325
00:21:21,905 --> 00:21:23,280
- No.
- Well, great!

326
00:21:23,281 --> 00:21:25,324
It'll be a great place
for some field research.

327
00:21:25,325 --> 00:21:26,742
Romance, flowers, candles--

328
00:21:26,743 --> 00:21:28,536
Do you think that maybe we
could just do this tomorrow?

329
00:21:28,537 --> 00:21:30,287
Uh, see,
I would love to do tomorrow,

330
00:21:30,288 --> 00:21:31,664
I just have to take
the first flight

331
00:21:31,665 --> 00:21:33,958
out in the morning
for my best friend's wedding.

332
00:21:33,959 --> 00:21:36,168
So, how about this?
We'll call it 08:00 sharp,

333
00:21:36,169 --> 00:21:37,795
and I'll see you there.
Yeah? I'm excited.

334
00:21:37,796 --> 00:21:39,923
- No, no, I--
- It's gonna be great!

335
00:21:41,716 --> 00:21:42,800
Oh, thank you so much.

336
00:21:42,801 --> 00:21:46,887
Uh, no, Mon. Let me get this.
You're, like, $100,000 in debt.

337
00:21:46,888 --> 00:21:48,056
Not anymore.

338
00:21:48,765 --> 00:21:51,100
Arthur paid it off.
And I get to keep the card.

339
00:21:51,101 --> 00:21:52,853
- Are you serious?
- Mmm-hmm.

340
00:21:53,645 --> 00:21:56,856
Damn. Someone likes a little
sugar with their daddy.

341
00:21:56,857 --> 00:22:00,025
A-ha. Excuse me, Ally.
I do not have a sugar daddy.

342
00:22:00,026 --> 00:22:01,903
That term is very problematic.

343
00:22:03,321 --> 00:22:04,322
I have a sponsor.

344
00:22:05,115 --> 00:22:08,742
And do you love your sponsor,
or is he just erasing your debt?

345
00:22:08,743 --> 00:22:12,288
Yes, I love him. And I love
that he's erasing my debt.

346
00:22:12,289 --> 00:22:15,416
So, when am I gonna meet this
secret Hugh Hefner?

347
00:22:15,417 --> 00:22:16,750
Shall we all get dinner soon?

348
00:22:16,751 --> 00:22:19,003
What do you say,
like, 4:30? Soup?

349
00:22:19,004 --> 00:22:20,546
Ha-ha. Real clever,
Miss Judgy Judy,

350
00:22:20,547 --> 00:22:22,256
while you're literally stalking
your ex online.

351
00:22:22,257 --> 00:22:24,508
I'm not stalking him.

352
00:22:24,509 --> 00:22:27,428
The algorithm
is stalking me, okay?

353
00:22:27,429 --> 00:22:29,972
- It's the algorithm?
- Hey, is Arthur Heart Eyes?

354
00:22:29,973 --> 00:22:32,017
Is that why
I haven't met him yet?

355
00:22:32,767 --> 00:22:34,269
That's not fucking funny.

356
00:22:38,565 --> 00:22:40,024
Of course
Arthur's not Heart Eyes.

357
00:22:40,025 --> 00:22:42,026
That guy has so much arthritis,
he can't run.

358
00:22:42,027 --> 00:22:43,986
- Honestly, I bet it's Crystal.
- Hmm.

359
00:22:43,987 --> 00:22:45,196
You know when she does that,

360
00:22:45,197 --> 00:22:46,697
- like, thing...
- Mmm-hmm.

361
00:22:46,698 --> 00:22:48,950
...when her Botox doesn't
sit right and it gets stuck?

362
00:22:51,828 --> 00:22:54,371
{\an8}<i>Breaking news.
Our Channel 7 affiliate</i>

363

<i>Thanks, Mike.
We have confirmed reports...</i>

368
00:23:04,382 --> 00:23:05,508
Ally.

369
00:23:05,509 --> 00:23:08,511
- Ally, hello? Hey, ho.
- Monica!

370
00:23:08,512 --> 00:23:10,137
Oh, my God.
Why are you torturing yourself?

371
00:23:10,138 --> 00:23:11,472
You're the one who ended things.

372
00:23:11,473 --> 00:23:14,308
I know.
He just moved on so fast.

373
00:23:14,309 --> 00:23:15,559
I mean, what even is her job?

374
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:17,394
Look at her feed.
It's all vacation pics.

375
00:23:17,395 --> 00:23:19,605
And she doesn't even have
rich parents. I checked.

376
00:23:19,606 --> 00:23:20,981
You need to stop
hate-fucking yourself

377
00:23:20,982 --> 00:23:22,316
and get out there
and actually find someone

378
00:23:22,317 --> 00:23:23,943
to actually fuck-fuck yourself,
you know?

379
00:23:23,944 --> 00:23:25,277
- No.
- Oh, what about that guy?

380
00:23:25,278 --> 00:23:26,445
He's so cute.

381
00:23:26,446 --> 00:23:28,656
The-- The bathroom boy.
You know? Your little stalker?

382
00:23:28,657 --> 00:23:30,616
You mean the guy
trying to take my job?

383
00:23:30,617 --> 00:23:31,910
Oh, my fuck.

384
00:23:32,911 --> 00:23:35,330
He is so hot,
I could literally throw up.

385
00:23:36,456 --> 00:23:38,041
My basement just flooded.

386
00:23:39,876 --> 00:23:41,169
He's okay.

387
00:23:41,545 --> 00:23:43,879
Wait, what are you
wearing on this date?

388
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:45,464
It's not a date.

389
00:23:45,465 --> 00:23:48,008
We're working. And what's wrong
with my clothes?

390
00:23:48,009 --> 00:23:51,220
- You look like a before picture.
- Monica! That is so mean!

391
00:23:51,221 --> 00:23:52,471
Okay, this place,
what's the vibe?

392
00:23:52,472 --> 00:23:53,806
Is it, what, fancy?

393
00:23:53,807 --> 00:23:56,476
- Yeah, it's fancy. Why?
- Come on.

394
00:23:57,269 --> 00:23:58,769
Where are we going?

395
00:23:58,770 --> 00:24:00,981
We're gonna go fuck up
a credit card.

396
00:24:13,451 --> 00:24:14,910
- It's gorgeous.
- So much skin.

397
00:24:14,911 --> 00:24:16,036
- Hike it up a little bit.
- It's so much skin.

398
00:24:16,037 --> 00:24:17,914
- It can go shorter.
- Monica, no! It's not a date.

399
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:36,766
No.

400
00:24:46,484 --> 00:24:49,737
Hi. Uh,
reservation for Simmonds.

401
00:24:49,738 --> 00:24:51,489
Of course. AJ?

402
00:24:53,283 --> 00:24:54,284
Arms out, please.

403
00:24:57,704 --> 00:25:00,039
- What gives?
- Heart Eyes.

404
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:01,374
Can't be too careful.

405
00:25:10,842 --> 00:25:12,636
I'm environmentally conscious.

406
00:25:24,856 --> 00:25:26,690
Sharp, my ass.

407
00:25:26,691 --> 00:25:28,692
You look so
beautiful tonight, darling.

408
00:25:28,693 --> 00:25:31,029
Happy Valentine's.
I really mean that.

409
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:35,616
Good evening, miss.
Will anyone else be joining you?

410
00:25:35,617 --> 00:25:37,744
Uh, yes. Um, a friend.

411
00:25:38,370 --> 00:25:39,578
A colleague.

412
00:25:39,579 --> 00:25:42,206
It's a-- It's a work dinner.

413
00:25:42,207 --> 00:25:43,958
Well, I'll be back
with the specials

414
00:25:43,959 --> 00:25:45,125
once your date arrives.

415
00:25:45,126 --> 00:25:46,837
Oh, no, no, no.
He's not my date.

416
00:26:07,148 --> 00:26:10,901
I am so sorry that I am late.
I tried to get a car.

417
00:26:10,902 --> 00:26:13,112
And for what it's worth,
I had no idea this place

418
00:26:13,113 --> 00:26:14,906
was gonna be this nice, but...

419
00:26:15,866 --> 00:26:18,201
- You look amazing.
- Thank you.

420
00:26:19,661 --> 00:26:21,245
Welcome to L'oie.

421
00:26:21,246 --> 00:26:22,788
May I offer you a beverage?

422
00:26:22,789 --> 00:26:25,040
- Um, I'm good. Thank you.
- Yeah, please. How about

423
00:26:25,041 --> 00:26:27,334
a bottle of champagne,
maybe two glasses?

424
00:26:27,335 --> 00:26:28,586
Oh, uh, no, no, no. I'm sorry.

425
00:26:28,587 --> 00:26:31,755
- No offense, but we're working.
- None taken.

426
00:26:31,756 --> 00:26:32,966
I'll be right back.

427
00:26:34,342 --> 00:26:35,969
So, where you from?

428
00:26:37,596 --> 00:26:39,013
Uh, Phoenix.

429
00:26:39,014 --> 00:26:40,307
Do you have siblings?

430
00:26:41,057 --> 00:26:42,057
No.

431
00:26:42,058 --> 00:26:44,102
Are your parents still together?

432
00:26:45,228 --> 00:26:46,478
Mmm-hmm.

433
00:26:46,479 --> 00:26:47,771
Well, that's nice.

434
00:26:47,772 --> 00:26:50,107
Yeah, I'd love to grow old
with somebody.

435
00:26:50,108 --> 00:26:51,442
Change their Depends?

436
00:26:51,443 --> 00:26:52,526
You know,

437
00:26:52,527 --> 00:26:55,779
I don't immediately go to poop
when I think about love,

438
00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:58,782
but yeah. I would change
an adult diaper

439
00:26:58,783 --> 00:27:00,702
if it was in the name of love.

440
00:27:08,126 --> 00:27:09,127
Here we are.

441
00:27:09,628 --> 00:27:11,045
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

442
00:27:11,046 --> 00:27:12,380
- Miss?
- Yeah.

443
00:27:13,465 --> 00:27:15,300
Didn't want any, but thank you.

444
00:27:17,260 --> 00:27:18,470
And for you, sir?

445
00:27:20,889 --> 00:27:23,057
- Thank you very much.
- Enjoy.

446
00:27:23,058 --> 00:27:24,142
What do you say?

447
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:26,561
To love?

448
00:27:30,941 --> 00:27:31,942
Okay.

449
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:35,861
- Listen, this is all very cute.
- Mmm-hmm.

450
00:27:35,862 --> 00:27:37,613
- And you're smooth.
- Oh, thanks.

451
00:27:37,614 --> 00:27:39,782
But I'm just trying
to salvage whatever's left

452
00:27:39,783 --> 00:27:41,659
of my career here,
so can we skip

453
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:44,411
whatever this is and get
to cracking this campaign?

454
00:27:44,412 --> 00:27:45,704
- By all means.
- Okay.

455
00:27:45,705 --> 00:27:47,248
I have a couple ideas in here.

456
00:27:47,249 --> 00:27:50,000
Some probably suck,
but I'm sure there's a kernel--

457
00:27:50,001 --> 00:27:51,878
You've had
your heart broken recently.

458
00:27:53,839 --> 00:27:56,382
- I'm sorry, what?
- No, I just like to think

459
00:27:56,383 --> 00:27:59,261
I'm intuitive
with these things and...

460
00:28:00,428 --> 00:28:03,597
Ew. Yeah, no.
I did not get my heart

461
00:28:03,598 --> 00:28:05,182
- broken recently.
- Mmm-hmm.

462
00:28:05,183 --> 00:28:06,642
And it's really
none of your business.

463
00:28:06,643 --> 00:28:08,185
Oh, you're totally right,
it's not.

464
00:28:08,186 --> 00:28:09,854
- Definitely not. Okay.
- Nope.

465
00:28:09,855 --> 00:28:12,440
- Um...
- It's just your campaign.

466
00:28:13,483 --> 00:28:17,152
Doomed lovers? I mean, it hardly
screams romance to me.

467
00:28:18,529 --> 00:28:21,239
The most romantic stories
of all time are doomed.

468
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:23,700
You got husbands, wives,

469
00:28:23,701 --> 00:28:25,451
partners, twin flames, soulmates.

470
00:28:25,452 --> 00:28:28,329
Whatever you wanna call it,
it's all gonna end.

471
00:28:28,330 --> 00:28:29,831
It's just
a matter of time before

472
00:28:29,832 --> 00:28:31,457
someone cheats, bails, or dies.

473
00:28:31,458 --> 00:28:34,002
What about butterflies
in your stomach?

474
00:28:34,003 --> 00:28:36,546
A lightning bolt to the heart?

475
00:28:36,547 --> 00:28:38,131
Cozy Sundays in bed?

476
00:28:38,132 --> 00:28:40,800
What's next, birth charts
and long walks on the beach?

477
00:28:40,801 --> 00:28:43,052
I like those things,
but I get it. Not for everyone.

478
00:28:43,053 --> 00:28:44,888
You wanna know how I feel
about romance?

479
00:28:44,889 --> 00:28:46,056
Yeah.

480
00:28:48,058 --> 00:28:49,393
It's a farce.

481
00:28:51,187 --> 00:28:52,271
A lie.

482
00:28:53,731 --> 00:28:56,400
Not to everyone, I know that.
Some people get...

483
00:28:57,193 --> 00:29:01,487
really lucky and stumble
into something real and forever.

484
00:29:01,488 --> 00:29:03,114
But the other 99% of us

485
00:29:03,115 --> 00:29:05,992
are just bouncing from one
failed experiment to the next,

486
00:29:05,993 --> 00:29:08,912
chasing the same regurgitated
fairy-tale bullshit

487
00:29:08,913 --> 00:29:11,748
that's been stuffed into our
brains since we were kids.

488
00:29:11,749 --> 00:29:15,001
Prince Charming? Till you
catch him fucking your sister.

489
00:29:15,002 --> 00:29:16,669
I thought you were
an only child.

490
00:29:16,670 --> 00:29:18,338
- It's a metaphor. Jesus.
- Right.

491
00:29:18,339 --> 00:29:20,090
My point is, it's not real.

492
00:29:21,342 --> 00:29:24,427
And somehow, I landed a job
that forces me to propagate

493
00:29:24,428 --> 00:29:26,596
a fantasy in order to sell
blood diamonds

494
00:29:26,597 --> 00:29:28,264
harvested from third-world
slave labor,

495
00:29:28,265 --> 00:29:30,225
so please forgive me
if I'm not swept away

496
00:29:30,226 --> 00:29:33,019
by your magical notions
of romance, Jay.

497
00:29:33,020 --> 00:29:34,104
Wow.

498
00:29:35,397 --> 00:29:36,732
That's really...

499
00:29:37,942 --> 00:29:38,943
What?

500
00:29:40,069 --> 00:29:41,070
...sad.

501
00:29:46,408 --> 00:29:47,535
Why are you single?

502
00:29:48,577 --> 00:29:51,247
- Excuse me?
- No, really, Mr. Romantic...

503
00:29:52,498 --> 00:29:53,748
doe-eyed, first love,

504
00:29:53,749 --> 00:29:56,376
Esther Perel mama's boy
know-it-all. Why are you single?

505
00:29:56,377 --> 00:29:58,461
- Well...
- Are you really looking for love

506
00:29:58,462 --> 00:30:00,713
or are you just another
fake-ass, ho-hunting,

507
00:30:00,714 --> 00:30:02,632
- ankle-cuff prick in a suit?
- Oh, my God.

508
00:30:02,633 --> 00:30:03,758
You know, you don't know me.

509
00:30:03,759 --> 00:30:05,426
And you
don't get to cast judgment

510
00:30:05,427 --> 00:30:07,888
just because I don't think
like you, okay?

511
00:30:13,936 --> 00:30:14,937
Yeah, um...

512
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:19,441
I think you were right.
Tonight's a bad night.

513
00:30:20,985 --> 00:30:22,902
Should've just
let you clear your head. Um...

514
00:30:22,903 --> 00:30:25,281
Don't worry about the champagne.
It's on Crystal.

515
00:30:35,624 --> 00:30:40,212
Jay! Jay!
I'm sorry, okay? You win.

516
00:30:40,713 --> 00:30:43,214
Listen, I told you it was fine
and I meant it. It's all good.

517
00:30:43,215 --> 00:30:45,383
No, I had
a really rough day and...

518
00:30:45,384 --> 00:30:48,595
and I took it out on you and
that was shitty and wrong and--

519
00:30:48,596 --> 00:30:50,388
Jay, please,
I can't lose this job.

520
00:30:50,389 --> 00:30:52,516
Ally, I am not
gonna take your job.

521
00:30:53,184 --> 00:30:54,642
Although it does seem like

522
00:30:54,643 --> 00:30:56,562
you don't really want
this job, but...

523
00:30:57,771 --> 00:31:00,315
This is me, so...

524
00:31:00,316 --> 00:31:02,817
I'm gonna go back to the hotel,
brainstorm some creative,

525
00:31:02,818 --> 00:31:04,612
see what we can
salvage from-- Oh!

526
00:31:10,409 --> 00:31:11,410
Ally?

527
00:31:14,371 --> 00:31:16,414
Collin! What are you doing here?

528
00:31:16,415 --> 00:31:19,918
Um, well, Sienna and I are on
a little dinner date, actually.

529
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:22,254
- I've heard so much about you.
- Really?

530
00:31:23,088 --> 00:31:24,089
Why?

531
00:31:25,216 --> 00:31:26,841
And, uh, you are?

532
00:31:26,842 --> 00:31:28,343
Oh, Jay. I'm Ally's...

533
00:31:28,344 --> 00:31:30,011
- He's my friend-- Boyfriend.
- ...Boyfriend.

534
00:31:30,012 --> 00:31:31,138
Friend. Boyfriend.

535
00:31:32,014 --> 00:31:33,723
I didn't know
you had a boyfriend.

536
00:31:33,724 --> 00:31:35,808
- Yeah! Yeah.
- Yeah.

537
00:31:35,809 --> 00:31:37,477
Yeah, I mean, why would you?

538
00:31:37,478 --> 00:31:40,898
It's not like I publicize it
on social media or anything.

539
00:31:43,567 --> 00:31:45,485
Uh, well, it's nice
to meet you, Jay.

540
00:31:45,486 --> 00:31:48,571
Pleasure. So, um, dinner, huh?

541
00:31:48,572 --> 00:31:50,949
Yeah. Uh, it was supposed
to be a double date,

542
00:31:50,950 --> 00:31:53,077
uh, but unfortunately...

543
00:31:53,911 --> 00:31:55,245
- Ooh.
- What does that mean?

544
00:31:55,246 --> 00:31:58,499
You know the couple that got
murdered up at the winery?

545
00:31:59,542 --> 00:32:01,543
- What, you know them?
- We worked together.

546
00:32:01,544 --> 00:32:03,295
- Played racquetball.
- Racquetball.

547
00:32:04,296 --> 00:32:05,296
It's tragic, really.

548
00:32:05,297 --> 00:32:07,799
- Still kept the reservation?
- And you still came to dinner?

549
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:09,843
Of course. In their honor.

550
00:32:09,844 --> 00:32:11,594
- Wow.
- Huh. Well, a lot to

551
00:32:11,595 --> 00:32:12,804
eat in there and it's good.

552
00:32:12,805 --> 00:32:14,681
We should go.
See you, Ally, and...

553
00:32:14,682 --> 00:32:16,057
You have such a sexy suit.

554
00:32:16,058 --> 00:32:18,059
- Oh, that's a sexy dress.
- Yeah. Oh, yeah.

555
00:32:18,060 --> 00:32:20,478
- You guys have a good dinner.
- Happy Valentine's Day!

556
00:32:20,479 --> 00:32:23,524
- Happy V-Day!
- Don't get killed, all right?

557
00:32:24,567 --> 00:32:26,484
- What was--
- Why would he say that?

558
00:32:26,485 --> 00:32:28,444
That was weird.
Oh, you're coming with me.

559
00:32:28,445 --> 00:32:30,239
That was so embarrassing.

560
00:32:46,005 --> 00:32:47,006
Thank you.

561
00:32:50,342 --> 00:32:52,803
Not a-- Not a problem.

562
00:33:00,561 --> 00:33:03,438
So is it the accent?
Is that what it is?

563
00:33:03,439 --> 00:33:05,356
Women love that fucking accent.

564
00:33:05,357 --> 00:33:07,484
God, I can't stand it now.

565
00:33:08,861 --> 00:33:11,739
- Brits are so unemotional.
- Mmm.

566
00:33:12,615 --> 00:33:16,785
Well, that would explain
the dead friends' resy.

567
00:33:17,578 --> 00:33:20,622
Love is a beautiful thing, no?

568
00:33:20,623 --> 00:33:22,832
- Oh, we-- we just work together.
- No, we're not a couple.

569
00:33:22,833 --> 00:33:24,792
- But you just kissed, no?
- Oh, see, no,

570
00:33:24,793 --> 00:33:25,877
that was a performance

571
00:33:25,878 --> 00:33:29,047
to seem maybe more desirable
and perhaps less pathetic

572
00:33:29,048 --> 00:33:32,634
- in front of her ex.
- Oh. You love Spotify?

573
00:33:32,635 --> 00:33:35,762
I have Ultimate Sexies
playlist and--

574
00:33:35,763 --> 00:33:37,222
- I love Spotify.
- Yeah, no,

575
00:33:37,223 --> 00:33:38,515
we're okay. Thank you.

576
00:33:38,516 --> 00:33:40,226
Can we add a stop?

577
00:33:41,685 --> 00:33:43,686
Again, I'm really sorry
about tonight.

578
00:33:43,687 --> 00:33:45,230
I swear I'm not a lunatic.

579
00:33:45,231 --> 00:33:48,275
That's exactly what I think
a lunatic would say.

580
00:33:49,401 --> 00:33:50,402
Okay.

581
00:33:52,821 --> 00:33:54,656
Have fun
at your best friend's wedding.

582
00:33:54,657 --> 00:33:55,741
Thank you.

583
00:34:02,748 --> 00:34:03,749
Okey dokey.

584
00:34:09,547 --> 00:34:10,548
What the...

585
00:34:12,090 --> 00:34:13,091
No!

586
00:34:13,092 --> 00:34:16,637
Next stop,
2640 Westlake Avenue South, sir?

587
00:34:18,389 --> 00:34:21,683
Hey, can you hold off a second?
I think she locked herself out.

588
00:34:21,684 --> 00:34:23,768
You know what you should do?

589
00:34:23,769 --> 00:34:26,145
You should go to her,

590
00:34:26,146 --> 00:34:29,233
tell her you love her,
then never let her go.

591
00:34:32,653 --> 00:34:36,115
Right. Right. Yeah, you just
keep that meter running.

592
00:34:38,075 --> 00:34:40,744
Howdy. Everything okay?

593
00:34:41,412 --> 00:34:42,413
No.

594
00:34:43,289 --> 00:34:45,832
No, I think I left my keys
in a dressing room somewhere.

595
00:34:45,833 --> 00:34:46,916
Oh.

596
00:34:47,501 --> 00:34:49,752
Oh, my God. This night
could not get any worse.

597
00:34:49,753 --> 00:34:51,005
You have a spare hidden?

598
00:34:51,672 --> 00:34:54,884
Yeah, under a mat upstairs.

599
00:34:56,135 --> 00:34:58,094
It's okay.
I'll just break the window.

600
00:34:58,095 --> 00:35:00,763
No. What are you talking about,
breaking windows? No.

601
00:35:00,764 --> 00:35:02,223
No, it's fine.
My landlord loves me.

602
00:35:02,224 --> 00:35:03,433
Well, if you're serious,

603
00:35:03,434 --> 00:35:04,767
maybe you just, you know,
let me do it.

604
00:35:04,768 --> 00:35:06,686
- I can break a window.
- No, I know you can

605
00:35:06,687 --> 00:35:08,813
break a window, but if you
cut yourself, I'll be--

606
00:35:08,814 --> 00:35:10,441
I'm not gonna cut myself.

607
00:35:11,609 --> 00:35:12,818
Knock yourself out.

608
00:35:13,485 --> 00:35:16,321
Just know I don't condone this.
I'm worried for your safety.

609
00:35:16,322 --> 00:35:18,823
And you're punching with your
thumb inside your hand,

610
00:35:18,824 --> 00:35:19,949
which is not a good thing.

611
00:35:19,950 --> 00:35:21,034
Okay. Yeah. You're gonna do it.

612
00:35:21,035 --> 00:35:23,579
Yeah. Why don't you hold that?
Came prepared.

613
00:35:25,789 --> 00:35:27,332
Ah, not so bad.

614
00:35:27,333 --> 00:35:28,417
That's bad.

615
00:35:29,335 --> 00:35:31,753
I'm so sorry.
This is all my fault.

616
00:35:31,754 --> 00:35:33,838
I'm sorry I'm bleeding
all over your floor.

617
00:35:33,839 --> 00:35:37,301
Here. Okay.
Let's run it under some water.

618
00:35:39,220 --> 00:35:41,304
- Thanks.
- Okay, you're just gonna wash up

619
00:35:41,305 --> 00:35:42,473
in here for a sec.

620
00:35:43,307 --> 00:35:44,599
Oh, God.

621
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:47,352
Sorry it's so messy.

622
00:35:47,353 --> 00:35:48,520
I had a house cleaner,

623
00:35:48,521 --> 00:35:51,606
but she won the lottery
last week and fired me.

624
00:35:51,607 --> 00:35:54,359
Really? How much did she win?

625
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:56,736
Like, a million dollars.

626
00:35:56,737 --> 00:36:01,992
Damn. Well, I hope you find
a replacement soon.

627
00:36:07,331 --> 00:36:08,541
Cute.

628
00:36:09,708 --> 00:36:12,043
I was Pikachu for Halloween too.

629
00:36:12,044 --> 00:36:15,005
- Yeah. That wasn't Halloween.
- What was it?

630
00:36:15,756 --> 00:36:18,049
It was Tuesday.
Yeah, I was pretty obsessed.

631
00:36:18,050 --> 00:36:19,552
Wore that shit everywhere.

632
00:36:21,387 --> 00:36:23,388
- I'll take that.
- It was on your shelf.

633
00:36:23,389 --> 00:36:24,889
No, I really wasn't
expecting company.

634
00:36:24,890 --> 00:36:26,140
Ever?

635
00:36:26,141 --> 00:36:27,725
Why don't you just take a seat

636
00:36:27,726 --> 00:36:29,562
while I look for
the first aid kit?

637
00:36:35,943 --> 00:36:36,944
Found it!

638
00:36:41,532 --> 00:36:42,533
Jay?

639
00:36:49,665 --> 00:36:50,666
Excuse you.

640
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,669
I'm sorry. I didn't wanna sit
on your nice clothes.

641
00:36:56,213 --> 00:36:57,214
Ow.

642
00:36:58,757 --> 00:36:59,758
Would you relax?

643
00:37:00,467 --> 00:37:02,428
It's just
a very expensive jacket.

644
00:37:03,971 --> 00:37:05,431
Let's see your hand.

645
00:37:07,850 --> 00:37:09,685
- Ooh.
- Careful now.

646
00:37:10,561 --> 00:37:11,562
Does it hurt?

647
00:37:12,813 --> 00:37:15,232
No, actually.
You're really good at this.

648
00:37:15,816 --> 00:37:17,400
Did you go to med school
or something?

649
00:37:17,401 --> 00:37:20,571
I dropped out actually.

650
00:37:21,947 --> 00:37:23,198
I really can't do blood.

651
00:37:23,199 --> 00:37:24,782
- No way.
- Mmm, way.

652
00:37:24,783 --> 00:37:26,117
Hmm.

653
00:37:26,118 --> 00:37:28,953
Well, I think you're doing
a pretty good job right now,

654
00:37:28,954 --> 00:37:30,456
if I do say so myself.

655
00:37:31,499 --> 00:37:32,540
- Uh--
- Oh.

656
00:37:32,541 --> 00:37:34,542
This is why we dropped out
of med school

657
00:37:34,543 --> 00:37:36,378
and pivoted to advertising.

658
00:37:38,214 --> 00:37:39,215
You're funny.

659
00:37:39,798 --> 00:37:41,717
- Am I?
- I think so, yeah.

660
00:37:46,305 --> 00:37:48,640
Would you mind?
My hair, falling in my face.

661
00:37:48,641 --> 00:37:49,975
- Oh, of course.
- Thank you.

662
00:37:57,566 --> 00:37:59,777
- Okay. There we go.
- Oh, wow.

663
00:38:04,865 --> 00:38:06,783
So, you mind my asking

664
00:38:06,784 --> 00:38:09,495
what kind of medicine
you were planning on going into?

665
00:38:10,287 --> 00:38:12,205
Uh, nephrology.

666
00:38:12,206 --> 00:38:13,832
That's the liver.

667
00:38:13,833 --> 00:38:14,916
Kidneys.

668
00:38:14,917 --> 00:38:16,292
- Nailed it. Damn.
- Yeah.

669
00:38:16,293 --> 00:38:17,794
Well, why that?

670
00:38:17,795 --> 00:38:20,088
I had a family member
that was pretty sick.

671
00:38:20,089 --> 00:38:21,297
Mmm-hmm.

672
00:38:21,298 --> 00:38:24,927
Guess I-- I don't know,
thought I could fix people.

673
00:38:26,971 --> 00:38:29,389
Anyway, now
I'm considered hemophobic.

674
00:38:29,390 --> 00:38:30,474
Oh.

675
00:38:31,058 --> 00:38:34,269
- I didn't take you for a bigot.
- Okay, wow.

676
00:38:34,270 --> 00:38:37,940
Between that and coffee mates,
your dad jokes are top-notch.

677
00:38:39,483 --> 00:38:42,986
I'm being facetious obviously.
Your jokes are cheesy as--

678
00:38:42,987 --> 00:38:44,071
Fuck!

679
00:38:44,864 --> 00:38:46,364
Ally! Ally!

680
00:38:46,365 --> 00:38:47,449
Oh, shit!

681
00:38:58,127 --> 00:39:00,379
Fuck you!
No, no, no, no, no, no!

682
00:39:01,839 --> 00:39:02,840
Run!

683
00:39:06,218 --> 00:39:08,595
Hold it! Hold it! Hold it!
What are you doing?

684
00:39:08,596 --> 00:39:10,305
Get your mind out of the gutter!

685
00:39:10,306 --> 00:39:11,431
Yep, yep, yep, yep.

686
00:39:11,432 --> 00:39:13,225
Come on. Come on, come on.
Come on, come on!

687
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:16,145
Come on, come on, come on!

688
00:39:16,937 --> 00:39:18,397
- You got it?
- Yes!

689
00:39:21,192 --> 00:39:22,193
Good job.

690
00:39:23,527 --> 00:39:24,528
Thanks.

691
00:39:26,071 --> 00:39:27,865
Hey, you good?

692
00:39:28,324 --> 00:39:29,325
Yeah.

693
00:39:32,369 --> 00:39:34,997
- Help! He's trying to kill us!
- Oh, here's lovebirds.

694
00:39:37,541 --> 00:39:39,125
No! No, no, no.
You've got the wrong people.

695
00:39:39,126 --> 00:39:40,877
- Hey! What are you doing?
- He only kills couples, right?

696
00:39:40,878 --> 00:39:42,670
We're not a couple.
We barely know each other.

697
00:39:42,671 --> 00:39:44,882
So back the fuck off!

698
00:39:45,549 --> 00:39:47,051
<i>911, what's your emergency?</i>

699
00:39:48,177 --> 00:39:49,178
Run!

700
00:39:51,889 --> 00:39:54,266
Help! Help!

701
00:39:55,184 --> 00:39:56,185
Help us!

702
00:40:03,651 --> 00:40:05,318
Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait.

703
00:40:05,319 --> 00:40:06,403
What?

704
00:40:08,489 --> 00:40:09,573
Did you hear that?

705
00:40:11,534 --> 00:40:12,618
I don't hear anything.

706
00:40:13,536 --> 00:40:14,537
Oh, shit!

707
00:40:15,454 --> 00:40:16,455
Ally!

708
00:40:17,414 --> 00:40:19,040
Get off of her!

709
00:40:19,041 --> 00:40:20,835
Hey, hey!

711
00:42:55,906 --> 00:42:58,993
No! No! No!

712
00:43:00,995 --> 00:43:02,788
Help! He's right behind...

713
00:43:05,166 --> 00:43:06,458
- Here!
- ...me.

714
00:43:08,794 --> 00:43:11,130
He was-- He was right here.

715
00:43:11,922 --> 00:43:13,215
I'll go check it out.

716
00:43:15,176 --> 00:43:16,177
Oh, my God. Jay.

717
00:43:17,136 --> 00:43:19,012
- Jay, is he okay?
- I don't know who

718
00:43:19,013 --> 00:43:20,555
- you're talking about.
- Jay Simmonds.

719
00:43:20,556 --> 00:43:21,931
We-- We were with each other
all night

720
00:43:21,932 --> 00:43:24,934
and-- and we got attacked
and we got separated back there.

721
00:43:24,935 --> 00:43:27,145
- You just left him?
- No, I didn't leave him!

722
00:43:27,146 --> 00:43:29,689
<i>All units.
All units, stand down.</i>

723
00:43:29,690 --> 00:43:31,524
<i>We have Heart Eyes.</i>

00:43:31,525 --> 00:43:33,902
<i>- I repeat, we have Heart Eyes.</i>
- Yes! We got that motherfucker!

725
00:43:33,903 --> 00:43:35,570
Seattle PD, baby! Fuck, yeah!

726
00:43:35,571 --> 00:43:37,405
<i>On behalf of Seattle PD,
I just wanna say--</i>

727
00:43:37,406 --> 00:43:39,032
Yeah, congratulations.

728
00:43:39,033 --> 00:43:40,993
<i>Incredible teamwork, huh?</i>

729
00:43:44,622 --> 00:43:46,832
Hey! Hey, you need to back up!

730
00:43:48,334 --> 00:43:50,168
- Fucking weirdos.
- What did I do?

731
00:43:50,169 --> 00:43:51,253
Detectives.

732
00:43:53,255 --> 00:43:54,340
Here she is.

733
00:43:55,341 --> 00:43:56,591
Detective Zeke Hobbs.

734
00:43:56,592 --> 00:43:58,886
This is my partner,
Detective Jeanine Shaw.

735
00:44:01,388 --> 00:44:02,389
Hobbs and Shaw?

736
00:44:04,141 --> 00:44:05,392
Like the movie?

737
00:44:08,229 --> 00:44:10,063
- I haven't heard of it.
- I haven't seen it.

738
00:44:10,064 --> 00:44:12,650
- We're here to ID a murderer.
- Oh, my God. Jay?

739
00:44:13,776 --> 00:44:14,777
Jay!

740
00:44:15,945 --> 00:44:18,072
- Jay, are you okay?
- Mmm-mmm.

741
00:44:19,448 --> 00:44:20,449
- Jay!
- Nope.

742
00:44:21,575 --> 00:44:23,201
Jay, are you okay?

743
00:44:23,202 --> 00:44:26,496
Uh, no, Ally, I'm not okay.

744
00:44:26,497 --> 00:44:29,166
Thank you for asking.
You ditched me.

745
00:44:29,917 --> 00:44:32,043
What? I did not ditch you!

746
00:44:32,044 --> 00:44:35,088
Oh, yes, you did! You absolutely
ditched me. We were a team.

747
00:44:35,089 --> 00:44:38,716
I was being chased
by a fucking serial killer!

748
00:44:38,717 --> 00:44:42,971
I know! I also was
being chased by a serial killer.

749
00:44:42,972 --> 00:44:45,890
- What the fuck does that mean?
- Jay, you're tall and ripped

750
00:44:45,891 --> 00:44:48,309
and-- and perfectly capable
of defending yourself.

751
00:44:48,310 --> 00:44:50,895
Ally, I really appreciate
the compliments,

752
00:44:50,896 --> 00:44:52,313
especially coming from you,

753
00:44:52,314 --> 00:44:54,315
but right now
is not the time, okay?

754
00:44:54,316 --> 00:44:56,401
These muscles were not made
for violence!

755
00:44:56,402 --> 00:44:57,652
They're for cuddling!

756
00:44:57,653 --> 00:44:59,237
- Okay.
- Hey, we're talking here!

757
00:44:59,238 --> 00:45:01,447
Guys, this was not him.
We were together all night.

758
00:45:01,448 --> 00:45:03,116
Heart Eyes was after both of us.

759
00:45:03,117 --> 00:45:06,495
Ma'am... We found this man
in the park wearing this

760
00:45:07,788 --> 00:45:09,372
and in possession of this.

761
00:45:09,373 --> 00:45:10,623
Come on!

762
00:45:10,624 --> 00:45:12,917
No, that's--
That's not possible.

763
00:45:12,918 --> 00:45:14,170
Jay didn't do this.

764
00:45:15,004 --> 00:45:16,005
Maybe.

765
00:45:17,423 --> 00:45:19,008
Maybe Jay wasn't acting alone.

766
00:45:20,050 --> 00:45:21,134
- What?
- What?

767
00:45:21,135 --> 00:45:22,677
We're gonna have to take your

768
00:45:22,678 --> 00:45:24,722
tall, ripped friend in
for questioning.

769
00:45:27,266 --> 00:45:28,267
Oh!

770
00:45:29,476 --> 00:45:32,521
Hey, good going. Really great.

771
00:45:35,065 --> 00:45:36,692
See you at the station, I guess.

772
00:45:39,403 --> 00:45:41,363
Fuck.

773
00:45:44,408 --> 00:45:45,409
What is this?

774
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:47,161
That's a ring.

775
00:45:48,954 --> 00:45:51,247
- Read it.
- Read what?

776
00:45:51,248 --> 00:45:53,500
Let me help you out.
Let me help you out.

777
00:45:53,501 --> 00:45:54,585
It says, "JS."

778
00:45:57,087 --> 00:45:59,506
- As in "Jay Simmonds."
- "Jay Simmonds."

779
00:45:59,507 --> 00:46:01,549
You are really good.

780
00:46:01,550 --> 00:46:03,384
You're really good
at detective work.

781
00:46:03,385 --> 00:46:05,095
That was really--
It's impressive.

782
00:46:10,100 --> 00:46:11,101
That sarcasm?

783
00:46:12,561 --> 00:46:15,730
A, I am not married.

784
00:46:15,731 --> 00:46:19,984
B, why would I leave a wedding
band at the scene of the crime?

785
00:46:19,985 --> 00:46:21,194
And C,

786
00:46:21,195 --> 00:46:23,530
who gets their own initials

787
00:46:23,531 --> 00:46:25,782
engraved in their
own fucking wedding band?

788
00:46:25,783 --> 00:46:27,032
Also, D,

789
00:46:27,033 --> 00:46:28,952
yes, that was sarcasm.

790
00:46:29,619 --> 00:46:31,703
- Hey, hey, hey! Hobbs.
- Hey, relax. Relax!

791
00:46:31,704 --> 00:46:33,414
Take five. Go. Go.

792
00:46:34,666 --> 00:46:35,667
Cool down.

793
00:46:36,292 --> 00:46:38,503
Come on.

794
00:46:45,718 --> 00:46:48,303
I'm sorry. He can get
a little hot under the collar.

795
00:46:48,304 --> 00:46:50,055
Yeah. No kidding.

796
00:46:50,056 --> 00:46:52,140
Do you need anything?
Water, coffee?

797
00:46:52,141 --> 00:46:55,603
- I am fine, thank you very much.
- Okay.

798
00:47:00,275 --> 00:47:01,276
Just you and me.

799
00:47:07,699 --> 00:47:09,659
I want you to look me
in the eyes

800
00:47:10,827 --> 00:47:12,161
and tell me the truth.

801
00:47:15,790 --> 00:47:16,791
All right.

802
00:47:17,625 --> 00:47:19,085
How long have you known Ally?

803
00:47:19,794 --> 00:47:20,795
Fourteen hours.

804
00:47:22,881 --> 00:47:24,257
You seem to care about her.

805
00:47:27,385 --> 00:47:29,304
Yeah. Maybe I do.

806
00:47:33,141 --> 00:47:35,851
But that ring. That's...
It's not yours, correct?

807
00:47:35,852 --> 00:47:38,479
No. Again, I am not married.

808
00:47:39,147 --> 00:47:40,147
You're not married.

809
00:47:40,148 --> 00:47:41,857
I mean, it's not, like,
by choice or anything.

810
00:47:41,858 --> 00:47:44,359
I--I just haven't met
the right person.

811
00:47:44,360 --> 00:47:45,528
You're telling me.

812
00:47:46,654 --> 00:47:49,032
- You're--
- Single. Shocker.

813
00:47:51,117 --> 00:47:52,118
Kind of.

814
00:47:53,036 --> 00:47:54,704
No-- You really, um...

815
00:47:59,083 --> 00:48:00,210
Okay, um...

816
00:48:01,961 --> 00:48:04,254
Lady, I have been waiting here
for over an hour.

817
00:48:04,255 --> 00:48:06,548
First of all, it's "officer."

818
00:48:06,549 --> 00:48:08,258
Second, I already told you

819
00:48:08,259 --> 00:48:09,968
they're interrogating
the suspect.

820
00:48:09,969 --> 00:48:12,471
And I already told you they're
interrogating the wrong guy.

821
00:48:12,472 --> 00:48:14,306
Can you please
just go back there

822
00:48:14,307 --> 00:48:16,183
and give me some sort
of information?

823
00:48:16,184 --> 00:48:18,477
Sorry, Fran. The ethernet cable
was all frayed.

824
00:48:18,478 --> 00:48:20,813
- Should be working now.
- Thanks, David.

825
00:48:21,064 --> 00:48:25,526
What's a five-letter word
for a dog ending in H?

826
00:48:25,527 --> 00:48:26,611
Bitch?

827
00:48:27,320 --> 00:48:28,321
Excuse me?

828
00:48:29,072 --> 00:48:30,073
Female dog.

829
00:48:32,825 --> 00:48:35,328
Oh, yeah. Thanks.

830
00:48:35,954 --> 00:48:38,832
Can you please go back there now
and give me some sort of update?

831
00:48:41,376 --> 00:48:42,919
- Fine.
- Thank you.

832
00:48:43,378 --> 00:48:45,839
Hey. Do we know each other?

833
00:48:46,714 --> 00:48:48,591
No, I don't think so.

834
00:48:49,467 --> 00:48:50,468
Bumble.

835
00:48:50,969 --> 00:48:53,471
Yeah, no. I'm...
I'm not on the apps.

836
00:48:53,638 --> 00:48:55,848
Oh. It's a waste of time anyway.

837
00:48:55,849 --> 00:48:56,975
Hmm.

838
00:48:58,935 --> 00:49:00,269
Just shooting my shot here.

839
00:49:00,270 --> 00:49:03,021
Um, could I take you out
to coffee some time?

840
00:49:03,022 --> 00:49:04,190
I'll pay for it.

841
00:49:05,316 --> 00:49:07,443
I almost got murdered tonight.

842
00:49:09,279 --> 00:49:10,947
- I am so sorry. Um...
- Yeah.

843
00:49:11,823 --> 00:49:13,824
Stay safe. Have a good night.

844
00:49:13,825 --> 00:49:14,951
Thank you.

845
00:49:16,369 --> 00:49:18,037
Where the hell is everybody?

846
00:49:18,705 --> 00:49:19,706
Celebrating.

847
00:49:21,749 --> 00:49:23,126
They caught Heart Eyes.

848
00:49:34,929 --> 00:49:36,556
<i>So, what else
do you want to tell me?</i>

849
00:49:37,390 --> 00:49:38,808
I'm not a serial killer.

850
00:49:40,435 --> 00:49:41,811
So there's that.

851
00:49:41,936 --> 00:49:45,564
Were you in Boston
in February of '23

852
00:49:45,565 --> 00:49:47,734
and Philadelphia
in February of '24?

853
00:49:49,402 --> 00:49:50,402
I...

854
00:49:50,403 --> 00:49:53,197
Let me rephrase.
You were in Boston and Philly.

855
00:49:53,198 --> 00:49:54,698
Same dates and locations

856
00:49:54,699 --> 00:49:56,784
as HEK's
two prior killing sprees.

857
00:49:58,536 --> 00:49:59,871
Jay, I got to admit...

858
00:50:00,622 --> 00:50:02,290
that doesn't look very good.

859
00:50:03,291 --> 00:50:05,042
I-- I don't know
what you want me to say.

860
00:50:05,043 --> 00:50:08,922
I'm a freelancer, so yeah,
I travel for, like, work.

861
00:50:10,507 --> 00:50:12,842
Do you ever get lonely
on the road?

862
00:50:14,469 --> 00:50:17,721
I like to think
that I can keep myself busy.

863
00:50:17,722 --> 00:50:19,474
Yeah? How?

864
00:50:20,517 --> 00:50:21,767
How do you blow off steam

865
00:50:21,768 --> 00:50:23,895
when you're alone
with your thoughts, Jay?

866
00:50:26,648 --> 00:50:28,066
Do you go to a vineyard?

867
00:50:29,234 --> 00:50:30,401
Maybe a spa?

868
00:50:40,620 --> 00:50:41,621
Holy... Who--

869
00:50:44,374 --> 00:50:46,625
<i>So, for HEK
to come out of the blue</i>

870
00:50:46,626 --> 00:50:50,045
<i>and denounce Valentine's Day
and all it stands for...</i>

871
00:50:50,046 --> 00:50:51,130
Hello?

872
00:50:51,256 --> 00:50:53,131
<i>...by cutting these couples
down to size.</i>

873
00:50:53,132 --> 00:50:55,593
<i>In my professional opinion,
what we have here...</i>

874
00:50:56,678 --> 00:50:57,679
Detective.

875
00:50:58,221 --> 00:50:59,763
We got an HWW out front.

876
00:50:59,764 --> 00:51:00,973
What do you want me to do
with her?

877
00:51:00,974 --> 00:51:02,224
An HWW?

878
00:51:02,225 --> 00:51:03,892
"Hysterical white woman."

879
00:51:03,893 --> 00:51:05,061
I'll handle her.

880
00:51:06,563 --> 00:51:07,564
You sit tight.

881
00:51:08,857 --> 00:51:09,983
We're not done yet.

882
00:51:12,068 --> 00:51:13,069
I'll be here.

883
00:51:13,987 --> 00:51:16,238
<i>He just snapped.</i>

884
00:51:16,239 --> 00:51:20,701
<i>And he makes it a point to kill
again and again</i>

885
00:51:20,702 --> 00:51:23,203
<i>until the very concept
of an entire day</i>

886
00:51:23,204 --> 00:51:27,959
<i>dedicated to couples and romance
is eradicated.</i>

887
00:51:28,793 --> 00:51:33,715
<i>He sneaks into your house
and waits in the dark.</i>

888
00:51:34,507 --> 00:51:38,511
<i>Cunning and quiet as a corpse.</i>

889
00:51:39,846 --> 00:51:43,099
<i>And then,
when you least expect it...</i>

890
00:51:44,851 --> 00:51:49,938
<i>he pulls out
one of the many, many, many toys</i>

891
00:51:49,939 --> 00:51:51,983
<i>from his tools.</i>

892
00:52:09,751 --> 00:52:11,835
- What the hell are you doing?
- God...

893
00:52:11,836 --> 00:52:13,546
bless the USA.

894
00:52:14,005 --> 00:52:15,088
- Told ya.
- Yeah.

895
00:52:15,089 --> 00:52:16,174
I'm so sorry.

896
00:52:17,383 --> 00:52:19,426
- Are you letting him go?
- Not yet.

897
00:52:19,427 --> 00:52:21,553
Why the hell not? He's innocent!

898
00:52:21,554 --> 00:52:23,680
Mmm-hmm.
Well, then tell me something.

899
00:52:23,681 --> 00:52:25,641
Why is the Heart Eyes Killer
after him?

900
00:52:25,642 --> 00:52:27,727
- You're not a couple.
- I don't know.

901
00:52:28,436 --> 00:52:31,855
I assume he saw us
and thought we were together.

902
00:52:31,856 --> 00:52:32,941
Why?

903
00:52:34,734 --> 00:52:35,735
We...

904
00:52:37,779 --> 00:52:38,821
kissed.

905
00:52:42,283 --> 00:52:44,869
We had-- We had-- We had--
We had to kiss.

906
00:52:46,120 --> 00:52:48,957
We had to kiss because...
because my ex...

907
00:52:49,916 --> 00:52:52,460
he was there, and I was jealous.

908
00:52:53,628 --> 00:52:55,629
- It's really stupid, I know.
- Okay.

909
00:52:55,630 --> 00:52:56,714
I get it.

910
00:52:57,841 --> 00:52:58,842
I do.

911
00:53:02,762 --> 00:53:05,932
So you're not interested
in him romantically?

912
00:53:07,225 --> 00:53:08,601
Why is that relevant?

913
00:53:09,519 --> 00:53:10,645
Just girl talk.

914
00:53:11,187 --> 00:53:12,981
I mean, he's cute, he has a...

915
00:53:13,690 --> 00:53:15,608
really good job.

916
00:53:17,277 --> 00:53:19,737
Perfect candidate
for a little girl like yourself.

917
00:53:21,906 --> 00:53:23,658
A little girl like myself?

918
00:53:27,287 --> 00:53:28,454
Ay.

919
00:53:29,539 --> 00:53:32,124
Oh, relax.
Probably just the breaker.

920
00:53:32,125 --> 00:53:34,961
That's what people say before
they get stabbed to death.

921
00:53:36,588 --> 00:53:37,714
How would you know?

922
00:53:39,883 --> 00:53:40,884
Watch her.

923
00:53:43,344 --> 00:53:44,887
No, no, no, no, no.
She said to watch me.

924
00:53:44,888 --> 00:53:47,556
Calm down, I'm just getting
a flashlight. Little space?

925
00:53:47,557 --> 00:53:49,642
Any closer, you'd be inside me.

926
00:53:50,351 --> 00:53:52,061
I'm sorry. I'm just scared.

927
00:53:54,022 --> 00:53:56,357
No, no, no, no. Careful.
He hides in closets.

928
00:54:05,491 --> 00:54:06,993
No killers in here.

929
00:54:51,496 --> 00:54:52,497
Help!

930
00:54:54,707 --> 00:54:56,291
Hey! Hey! What--
What's happening?

931
00:54:56,292 --> 00:54:57,585
- He's here.
- Who?

932
00:54:59,587 --> 00:55:00,964
Go! Get back! Get back!

933
00:55:09,472 --> 00:55:11,598
Hey. Hey. Hey, hey. Hey!

934
00:55:11,599 --> 00:55:13,308
Where are you going? Uncuff me.

935
00:55:13,309 --> 00:55:14,811
Don't worry, lover boy.

936
00:55:15,520 --> 00:55:16,813
I'll protect you.

937
00:55:17,522 --> 00:55:20,275
No. No. No.

938
00:55:28,533 --> 00:55:30,076
God! Damn it!

939
00:55:34,497 --> 00:55:35,748
Shaw?

940
00:55:55,143 --> 00:55:56,144
Shaw!

941
00:56:32,096 --> 00:56:33,097
Jay?

942
00:56:34,098 --> 00:56:35,099
Jay!

943
00:56:36,184 --> 00:56:37,519
Jay, can you hear me?

944
00:56:38,353 --> 00:56:39,686
<i>Yes, yes, Ally.</i>

945
00:56:39,687 --> 00:56:41,856
<i>Ally, you've gotta
find the keys.</i>

946
00:56:42,190 --> 00:56:45,067
Uh, Hobbs has the keys, okay?
You have to find Hobbs

947
00:56:45,068 --> 00:56:48,655
'cause he locked me in here
like a fucking asshole.

948
00:56:50,782 --> 00:56:51,783
Ally?

949
00:56:54,786 --> 00:56:55,787
<i>Ally?</i>

950
00:56:59,791 --> 00:57:01,084
She ditched me.

951
00:57:03,461 --> 00:57:04,462
That's okay.

952
00:57:07,006 --> 00:57:08,007
Ally?

953
00:57:20,979 --> 00:57:22,021
Hey.

954
00:57:26,276 --> 00:57:27,277
Hey.

955
00:57:31,531 --> 00:57:32,532
Come on.

956
00:57:33,116 --> 00:57:34,117
Hey, come on.

957
00:57:34,534 --> 00:57:35,535
This is not fair!

958
00:57:38,121 --> 00:57:39,122
Shit!

959
00:57:48,923 --> 00:57:50,008
Die.

960
00:57:52,385 --> 00:57:53,511
Ally! Ally!

961
00:57:54,053 --> 00:57:55,805
Goddamn! I'm right here!

962
00:57:57,974 --> 00:57:58,975
Jay!

963
00:57:59,642 --> 00:58:00,643
Careful! Careful.

964
00:58:03,563 --> 00:58:04,647
- Hi.
- Hi.

965
00:58:07,942 --> 00:58:08,943
Are you okay?

966
00:58:10,612 --> 00:58:12,613
You're a terrible shot,
by the way.

967
00:58:12,614 --> 00:58:14,407
Don't fucking push it, Romeo.

968
00:58:17,702 --> 00:58:19,578
- No! Hey!
- Ally!

969
00:58:19,579 --> 00:58:21,706
- Stop!
- No, no, no! Ally!

970
00:58:23,082 --> 00:58:24,374
Fucking assholes!

971
00:58:24,375 --> 00:58:25,709
You saved my life.

972
00:58:25,710 --> 00:58:26,878
You saved mine.

973
00:58:27,587 --> 00:58:28,588
I owed you one.

974
00:58:33,134 --> 00:58:34,426
We're not together!

975
00:58:34,427 --> 00:58:36,011
Go kill somebody else!

976
00:58:36,012 --> 00:58:38,431
- Get up. Get up. Get up.
- He's coming. He's coming.

977
00:58:45,230 --> 00:58:48,273
Oh, fuck.
Do you know what we just did?

978
00:58:48,274 --> 00:58:50,984
Yeah. We led a couples-killing
maniac to a...

979
00:58:50,985 --> 00:58:52,986
- To an all-you-can-kill buffet.
- Come on.

980
00:58:52,987 --> 00:58:55,781
<i>A big fat lummox like you
hiring an aeroplane to write,</i>

981
00:58:55,782 --> 00:58:59,369
<i>"Hildy, don't be hasty.
Remember my dimple. Walter."</i>

982
00:58:59,744 --> 00:59:01,203
<i>Delayed our divorce 20 minutes</i>

983
00:59:01,204 --> 00:59:03,039
<i>while the judge
went out to watch it.</i>

984
00:59:07,836 --> 00:59:09,003
Are you kidding me?

985
00:59:10,922 --> 00:59:12,882
Oh, shit!

986
00:59:21,766 --> 00:59:23,226
Yo, that costume is dope.

987
00:59:26,896 --> 00:59:28,022
I don't like that.

988
00:59:31,067 --> 00:59:32,610
That's not him, right?

989
00:59:33,945 --> 00:59:35,070
What the fuck?

990
00:59:35,071 --> 00:59:36,154
It is him!

991
00:59:36,155 --> 00:59:37,239
<i>Was it my fault?</i>

992
00:59:37,240 --> 00:59:39,992
<i>Did I know that coal mine
was gonna have another cave-in?</i>

993
00:59:39,993 --> 00:59:43,120
<i>I intended to be with you
on our honeymoon, Hildy.</i>

994
00:59:43,121 --> 00:59:44,205
'Sup, man?

995
00:59:47,041 --> 00:59:49,626
<i>I spent two weeks in a coal mine
with John Kruptzky.</i>

996
00:59:49,627 --> 00:59:51,253
<i>You don't deny that,
do you, Walter?</i>

997
00:59:51,254 --> 00:59:52,504
<i>Deny it? I'm proud of it.</i>

998
00:59:52,505 --> 00:59:54,173
<i>We beat the whole country
on that story.</i>

999
00:59:54,174 --> 00:59:56,258
<i>Suppose we did. That isn't
what I got married for!</i>

1000
00:59:56,259 --> 00:59:57,343
Excuse us.

1001
00:59:58,845 --> 00:59:59,888
What a creep.

1002
01:00:05,018 --> 01:00:06,018
Left. Left.

1003
01:00:06,019 --> 01:00:08,146
No. Right. Go. Go, go, go.

1004
01:00:09,230 --> 01:00:10,231
Turn.

1005
01:00:12,775 --> 01:00:13,776
In here.

1006
01:00:27,624 --> 01:00:28,832
Hmm?

1007
01:00:28,833 --> 01:00:31,585
Put a fucking shirt on.
There's a killer after us.

1008
01:00:31,586 --> 01:00:33,379
Mmm. Oh, what is it?

1009
01:00:34,714 --> 01:00:36,298
The Heart Eyes Killer.

1010
01:00:36,299 --> 01:00:38,675
He's out there right now.
We need to be quiet.

1011
01:00:38,676 --> 01:00:42,387
Oh! Dude, that's so hot. Fuck.

1012
01:00:42,388 --> 01:00:44,515
- We love role-play.
- Yeah.

1013
01:00:44,516 --> 01:00:46,975
- Oh, my God. He's coming.
- We're so dead.

1014
01:00:46,976 --> 01:00:48,977
Oh, he's so scary and big.

1015
01:00:48,978 --> 01:00:50,480
- We can't stay here.
- No.

1016
01:00:54,609 --> 01:00:56,151
- ...<i>without shuddering.
- Walter...</i>

1017
01:00:56,152 --> 01:00:57,861
<i>I made a great reporter
out of you.</i>

1018
01:00:57,862 --> 01:00:59,988
<i>You won't be half as good
on another paper.</i>

1019
01:00:59,989 --> 01:01:01,073
<i>We're a team.</i>

1020
01:01:01,074 --> 01:01:03,158
<i>You need me, I need you,
the paper needs us!</i>

1021
01:01:03,159 --> 01:01:04,327
<i>Sold, American!</i>

1022
01:01:05,745 --> 01:01:07,371
<i>It just didn't work out, Walter.</i>

1023
01:01:07,372 --> 01:01:08,455
Oh, fuck.

1024
01:01:08,456 --> 01:01:10,916
<i>It would've worked out
if you'd been satisfied...</i>

1025
01:01:10,917 --> 01:01:12,835
Maybe we lay low
for a little bit.

1026
01:01:12,836 --> 01:01:13,961
Yeah.

1027
01:01:13,962 --> 01:01:15,088
<i>I wasn't satisfied.</i>

1028
01:01:15,630 --> 01:01:17,047
<i>I suppose I proposed to you?</i>

1029
01:01:17,048 --> 01:01:18,131
<i>You practically did.</i>

1030
01:01:18,132 --> 01:01:20,300
<i>Making goo-goo eyes at me
for two years.</i>

1031
01:01:20,301 --> 01:01:22,261
<i>"Oh, Walter." And I still...</i>

1032
01:01:22,262 --> 01:01:24,304
I actually kind of
like this movie.

1033
01:01:24,305 --> 01:01:26,099
- Yeah, you like that?
- Yeah.

1034
01:01:26,933 --> 01:01:27,976
Really?

1035
01:01:30,061 --> 01:01:31,646
Yeah. Are you surprised?

1036
01:01:33,940 --> 01:01:35,483
Little bit, yeah.

1037
01:01:40,697 --> 01:01:42,407
I did ditch you.

1038
01:01:44,158 --> 01:01:45,994
No. Ditch me?

1039
01:01:48,204 --> 01:01:49,539
It's what I'm best at.

1040
01:01:50,248 --> 01:01:51,958
- Ditching people?
- Running.

1041
01:01:52,584 --> 01:01:54,793
Hey, I was holding my own.
You didn't see me?

1042
01:01:54,794 --> 01:01:56,921
He was shaking
in his little leather boots.

1043
01:02:01,634 --> 01:02:04,137
Jay, I wasn't entirely honest
at dinner.

1044
01:02:05,555 --> 01:02:07,473
My parents had this, like...

1045
01:02:09,017 --> 01:02:10,727
storybook romance.

1046
01:02:12,312 --> 01:02:14,063
They were literally
perfect together.

1047
01:02:17,525 --> 01:02:18,818
And then my dad died.

1048
01:02:22,655 --> 01:02:24,699
I don't think
my mom ever fully recovered.

1049
01:02:28,453 --> 01:02:29,454
I'm sorry.

1050
01:02:32,957 --> 01:02:34,292
You know, when I was a kid,

1051
01:02:35,418 --> 01:02:38,713
my parents just...
hated each other.

1052
01:02:39,672 --> 01:02:42,884
I mean, they fought...
all the time.

1053
01:02:44,511 --> 01:02:45,803
I think that...

1054
01:02:46,930 --> 01:02:48,431
is why I'm just this...

1055
01:02:50,266 --> 01:02:51,726
hapless romantic.

1056
01:02:53,019 --> 01:02:56,563
Just putting every girl
I fall for on a pedestal,

1057
01:02:56,564 --> 01:02:59,608
only to have
my heart broken over...

1058
01:02:59,609 --> 01:03:01,360
- More.
- and over...

1059
01:03:01,361 --> 01:03:02,528
More?

1060
01:03:02,529 --> 01:03:03,655
...and over.

1061
01:03:05,406 --> 01:03:06,615
Keep going.

1062
01:03:06,616 --> 01:03:07,909
All because they...

1063
01:03:10,203 --> 01:03:13,330
they just can't... breathe

1064
01:03:13,331 --> 01:03:15,291
my suffocating attempt

1065
01:03:16,626 --> 01:03:19,337
to prove Mom and Dad wrong.

1066
01:03:24,592 --> 01:03:25,677
You know, I think...

1067
01:03:27,428 --> 01:03:30,347
I think tonight
should've been, like,

1068
01:03:30,348 --> 01:03:32,058
the worst night of my life.

1069
01:03:36,312 --> 01:03:37,313
But it isn't.

1070
01:03:42,443 --> 01:03:43,444
Ditto.

1071
01:03:46,114 --> 01:03:47,365
Baby, you're so wet.

1072
01:03:53,913 --> 01:03:56,708
God, you're so hard! Ow!

1073
01:04:01,004 --> 01:04:02,337
At least they're having fun.

1074
01:04:02,338 --> 01:04:03,882
Oh, shit!

1075
01:04:05,800 --> 01:04:06,801
It's kinda loud.

1076
01:04:09,179 --> 01:04:10,180
Yeah, it's too loud.

1077
01:04:10,513 --> 01:04:11,556
Shut the fuck up!

1078
01:04:12,348 --> 01:04:15,017
- Shut up! Shut the fuck up.
- Quiet down!

1079
01:04:15,018 --> 01:04:17,227
- Samm! I'm coming!
- Oh, God!

1080
01:04:17,228 --> 01:04:19,856
- I'm coming!
- Shut up! Shut up!

1081
01:04:42,044 --> 01:04:45,422
Holy shit. Someone call 911!

1082
01:04:50,469 --> 01:04:51,470
Fuck!

1083
01:04:58,227 --> 01:04:59,228
Please, no!

1084
01:05:38,976 --> 01:05:40,476
What are you-- Hey, Ally.

1085
01:05:40,477 --> 01:05:41,978
- What are you doing?
- Wait.

1086
01:05:41,979 --> 01:05:43,856
Wait for what?
He's gonna kill us.

1087
01:05:44,731 --> 01:05:46,316
And if he doesn't kill us,

1088
01:05:47,192 --> 01:05:48,943
he's gonna keep killing people.

1089
01:05:48,944 --> 01:05:50,237
We brought him here,

1090
01:05:51,822 --> 01:05:52,823
we end it here.

1091
01:05:53,365 --> 01:05:54,783
- We--
- Come on.

1092
01:05:55,617 --> 01:05:57,119
I thought we were a team.

1093
01:06:39,286 --> 01:06:40,996
Hey, Fuck Eyes!

1094
01:06:44,500 --> 01:06:45,542
Wait, wait, wait.

1095
01:06:46,460 --> 01:06:47,461
We need a weapon.

1096
01:06:48,587 --> 01:06:49,588
I have this.

1097
01:06:50,464 --> 01:06:52,174
That is not a weapon.

1098
01:06:55,010 --> 01:06:56,011
That could work.

1099
01:07:02,434 --> 01:07:04,520
- I don't think I can do that.
- What? Hey...

1100
01:07:04,978 --> 01:07:05,979
Yes, you can.

1101
01:07:07,022 --> 01:07:08,023
Come on.

1102
01:07:25,415 --> 01:07:26,416
Run!

1103
01:07:29,837 --> 01:07:30,838
Ally!

1104
01:08:04,288 --> 01:08:05,455
Oh, shit!

1105
01:08:20,929 --> 01:08:22,471
Thanks a lot, Jay.

1106
01:08:22,848 --> 01:08:23,849
What?

1107
01:08:25,184 --> 01:08:26,684
You got it in my mouth.

1108
01:08:26,685 --> 01:08:28,059
I just saved your life.

1109
01:08:28,060 --> 01:08:29,896
Oh, my God.
I think I'm gonna be sick.

1110
01:08:29,897 --> 01:08:31,023
No. Hey.

1111
01:08:31,940 --> 01:08:32,983
Oh, no, no, no.

1112
01:08:41,324 --> 01:08:43,367
I told you
I was not good with blood.

1113
01:08:43,368 --> 01:08:44,578
Yeah, no kidding.

1114
01:09:04,890 --> 01:09:06,516
Uh, who the fuck is that?

1115
01:09:07,559 --> 01:09:08,852
I have no idea.

1116
01:09:15,067 --> 01:09:16,859
He's lost a lot of blood here.

1117
01:09:17,986 --> 01:09:19,529
Do you have an ID on the victim?

1118
01:09:20,029 --> 01:09:22,491
You two, you're gonna be famous.

1119
01:09:23,033 --> 01:09:25,743
The couple
that stopped Heart Eyes. I--

1120
01:09:28,788 --> 01:09:30,040
It's very cute.

1121
01:09:30,998 --> 01:09:32,207
Thank-- Thank-- Thank you.

1122
01:09:32,208 --> 01:09:33,669
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1123
01:09:34,461 --> 01:09:35,921
I'm gonna leave you alone now.

1124
01:09:43,470 --> 01:09:44,846
Shot in the dark here.

1125
01:09:46,265 --> 01:09:47,557
Wanna come back to my hotel

1126
01:09:47,558 --> 01:09:50,185
and try and crack this campaign
before my flight?

1127
01:09:52,354 --> 01:09:54,189
Just actually eat some dinner.

1128
01:09:54,773 --> 01:09:56,608
Order a whole bunch
of room service.

1129
01:09:59,528 --> 01:10:00,571
Um...

1130
01:10:02,239 --> 01:10:04,366
Jay, I can't.

1131
01:10:12,374 --> 01:10:13,417
Hey, you two.

1132
01:10:17,045 --> 01:10:19,590
Just wanted to make sure
you both got home safe.

1133
01:10:20,174 --> 01:10:21,466
Either of you need a lift?

1134
01:10:22,092 --> 01:10:24,761
Um... Actually...

1135
01:10:26,638 --> 01:10:28,639
I don't suppose
you have a phone,

1136
01:10:28,640 --> 01:10:30,016
just so I can call a cab?

1137
01:10:30,017 --> 01:10:32,143
No, don't be silly.
I'll give you a ride home.

1138
01:10:32,144 --> 01:10:33,853
Least I can do.

1139
01:10:33,854 --> 01:10:35,189
Your chariot awaits.

1140
01:10:36,523 --> 01:10:37,774
Okay.

1141
01:10:42,863 --> 01:10:43,989
Work call later?

1142
01:10:46,408 --> 01:10:47,576
Sounds like a plan.

1143
01:10:51,622 --> 01:10:53,956
Hey, uh, does anyone have a pen?

1144
01:10:53,957 --> 01:10:55,459
- I got you, dude.
- Okay.

1145
01:10:57,878 --> 01:10:58,879
Can I see that?

1146
01:11:06,512 --> 01:11:07,930
That's me.

1147
01:11:11,433 --> 01:11:12,851
Your chariot awaits.

1148
01:11:22,486 --> 01:11:23,862
She's not my type.

1149
01:11:42,089 --> 01:11:44,340
Hey, I got another call,

1150
01:11:44,341 --> 01:11:46,467
so I'm just gonna
have to take that

1151
01:11:46,468 --> 01:11:48,220
and that too.

1152
01:12:01,817 --> 01:12:03,443
Hey, do you need a ride?

1153
01:12:40,480 --> 01:12:41,480
Hey.

1154
01:12:41,481 --> 01:12:43,441
<i>Um, do you have
something you wanna tell me?</i>

1155
01:12:43,442 --> 01:12:45,067
Oh, you're never gonna believe
what happened.

1156
01:12:45,068 --> 01:12:46,694
<i>Hello, Heart Eyes?
Are you kidding me?</i>

1157
01:12:46,695 --> 01:12:47,987
But wait. Are you okay?

1158
01:12:47,988 --> 01:12:49,447
Tell me the truth.
Do you need to come over?

1159
01:12:49,448 --> 01:12:50,782
You can sleep
in Arthur's panic room.

1160
01:12:52,993 --> 01:12:54,703
No, I-- I hate this feeling.

1161
01:12:55,621 --> 01:12:56,622
<i>What feeling?</i>

1162
01:12:58,332 --> 01:12:59,500
Liking someone.

1163
01:13:00,667 --> 01:13:02,127
God, I fucked up.

1164
01:13:03,170 --> 01:13:04,295
I fucked up, Mon.

1165
01:13:04,296 --> 01:13:06,547
I met a really,
really great guy,

1166
01:13:06,548 --> 01:13:07,716
and now he's gone.

1167
01:13:10,719 --> 01:13:11,720
Where is he?

1168
01:13:12,346 --> 01:13:13,638
At the airport.

1169
01:13:13,639 --> 01:13:15,890
Oh. Okay, great.
He's at the airport. Go get him.

1170
01:13:15,891 --> 01:13:16,974
<i>Mon, I--</i>

1171
01:13:16,975 --> 01:13:19,811
<i>Hey, Ally. Ally, listen to me.</i>

1172
01:13:20,395 --> 01:13:21,854
<i>You deserve to be happy.</i>

1173
01:13:21,855 --> 01:13:24,023
You deserve
to have someone love you

1174
01:13:24,024 --> 01:13:27,277
for the beautiful,
neurotic mess that you are.

1175
01:13:28,195 --> 01:13:30,238
<i>I mean, you can be
so clueless sometimes.</i>

1176
01:13:30,239 --> 01:13:32,740
It's one of the ten things
I hate about you, honestly.

1177
01:13:32,741 --> 01:13:35,409
You can't let Jay go off
to his best friend's wedding

1178
01:13:35,410 --> 01:13:37,036
and hook up
with a bunch of bridesmaids

1179
01:13:37,037 --> 01:13:38,539
<i>and move to Notting Hill. No.</i>

1180
01:13:39,081 --> 01:13:40,415
<i>This is love, mama.</i>

1181
01:13:41,083 --> 01:13:43,626
Some kind of wonderful,

1182
01:13:43,627 --> 01:13:46,964
crazy, stupid love, actually.

1183
01:13:48,924 --> 01:13:51,801
<i>Go get him. Go get
that beautiful, melanin man.</i>

1184
01:13:51,802 --> 01:13:53,052
- Okay!
<i>- He's gorgeous!</i>

1185
01:13:53,053 --> 01:13:54,178
- Oh, my God.
<i>- Ally, go!</i>

1186
01:13:54,179 --> 01:13:55,763
<i>- You go get him right now!</i>
- Okay. I'm going.

1187
01:13:55,764 --> 01:13:57,182
<i>I love you! You're beautiful!</i>

1188
01:13:59,518 --> 01:14:01,811
<i>This is your final call

1189

Thank you.

1191
01:14:09,611 --> 01:14:10,611

<i>Please have

<i>Thank you.</i>

1195
01:14:19,121 --> 01:14:20,122
Jay?

1196
01:14:22,499 --> 01:14:23,875
- Jay!
- Fuck!

1197
01:14:23,876 --> 01:14:24,960
Sorry.

1198
01:14:28,255 --> 01:14:29,256
Jay!

1199
01:14:32,342 --> 01:14:33,676
Oh, my God. I'm so sorry.

1200
01:14:33,677 --> 01:14:35,304
I thought
you were somebody else.

1201

<i>violets are black.</i>

1209
01:14:51,695 --> 01:14:53,321
<i>Guess who's with me</i>

1210

<i>and not coming back?</i>

Okay.

<i>Call for help, he dies.</i>

01:16:04,184 --> 01:16:06,520
<i>They say love is blind</i>

1223
01:16:07,437 --> 01:16:10,023
<i>and lovers cannot see,</i>

1224
01:16:12,985 --> 01:16:17,239
<i>the pretty follies
that they themselves commit.</i>

1225
01:16:19,074 --> 01:16:22,244
<i>But love isn't blind...</i>

1226
01:16:30,460 --> 01:16:31,461
is it?

1227
01:16:32,713 --> 01:16:33,839
Wait, you're--

1228
01:16:35,174 --> 01:16:36,175
It's me.

1229
01:16:38,510 --> 01:16:39,511
David.

1230
01:16:44,433 --> 01:16:45,559
The IT guy.

1231
01:16:46,852 --> 01:16:48,937
Wait, who the fuck
did we kill then?

1232
01:16:50,272 --> 01:16:51,315
Eli.

1233
01:16:51,815 --> 01:16:53,984
Poor, stupid Eli.

1234
01:16:54,443 --> 01:16:55,985
You guys were a couple?

1235
01:16:55,986 --> 01:16:57,362
Couple? No. No.

1236
01:16:59,823 --> 01:17:00,824
Throuple.

1237
01:17:04,620 --> 01:17:07,331
Love looks with eyes wide open.

1238
01:17:09,124 --> 01:17:11,543
Seeking what the heart desires
the most.

1239
01:17:13,462 --> 01:17:14,463
A partner.

1240
01:17:15,923 --> 01:17:17,466
Its true companion.

1241
01:17:22,888 --> 01:17:25,599
I found mine ten years ago
in a chat room.

1242
01:17:27,226 --> 01:17:28,601
David saw me.

1243
01:17:28,602 --> 01:17:30,311
He understood me

1244
01:17:30,312 --> 01:17:32,147
and I understood him.

1245
01:17:39,488 --> 01:17:40,697
We got married here.

1246
01:17:41,698 --> 01:17:44,243
You know, I didn't really
take you for the religious type.

1247
01:17:45,577 --> 01:17:48,497
No. We just like the story.

1248
01:17:51,667 --> 01:17:53,126
Saint Valentine...

1249
01:17:55,838 --> 01:17:57,089
was beheaded.

1250
01:18:00,551 --> 01:18:02,469
You murdered innocent people.

1251
01:18:03,929 --> 01:18:05,931
- Share what you love.
- Share what you love.

1252
01:18:08,225 --> 01:18:11,311
<i>And we love hunting, killing...</i>

1253
01:18:12,521 --> 01:18:13,647
<i>Deceit.</i>

1254
01:18:14,481 --> 01:18:16,525
<i>Taking turns on our victims.</i>

1255
01:18:18,151 --> 01:18:19,444
<i>Murdering couples.</i>

1256
01:18:23,031 --> 01:18:24,491
<i>- It's our kink.
- It's our kink.</i>

1257
01:18:25,868 --> 01:18:27,786
<i>Everybody's got a fetish.</i>

1258
01:18:32,791 --> 01:18:35,459
Well, too bad we wasted
your boyfriend at the drive-in.

1259
01:18:35,460 --> 01:18:38,380
Oh, God.
He wasn't our boyfriend.

1260
01:18:38,797 --> 01:18:41,799
No, Eli was just
a stupid fanboy.

1261
01:18:41,800 --> 01:18:43,467
He was obsessed with us.

1262
01:18:43,468 --> 01:18:44,719
He was obsessed with me.

1263
01:18:44,720 --> 01:18:46,430
Yeah. Learned a lot from me.

1264
01:18:47,431 --> 01:18:48,432
It just got messy.

1265
01:18:49,183 --> 01:18:50,308
Fuck!

1266
01:18:50,309 --> 01:18:51,643
<i>I almost got you at home.</i>

1267
01:18:52,477 --> 01:18:53,478
Go, go, go, go!

1268
01:18:54,855 --> 01:18:56,440
- I killed your driver.
- ...lovebirds.

1269
01:18:57,316 --> 01:18:58,524
No, no, no!
You've got the wrong people.

1270
01:18:58,525 --> 01:18:59,609
What are you--

1271
01:18:59,610 --> 01:19:02,946
And I had a blast wasting those
vile dickheads at the winery.

1272
01:19:05,240 --> 01:19:07,201
Ooh! That reminds me.

1273
01:19:08,202 --> 01:19:09,744
- Huh.
- Found this.

1274
01:19:09,745 --> 01:19:13,498
God, you're the fucking best.

1275
01:19:13,499 --> 01:19:14,999
Isn't she the fucking best?

1276
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:16,083
Yeah, I know.

1277
01:19:16,084 --> 01:19:17,794
And as luck would have it,

1278
01:19:19,004 --> 01:19:20,213
your initials match.

1279
01:19:20,214 --> 01:19:22,883
J. Shaw.

1280
01:19:23,342 --> 01:19:26,261
Jeanine Shaw, bitch.

1281
01:19:27,513 --> 01:19:29,847
Why us? We're not even a couple.

1282
01:19:29,848 --> 01:19:32,226
Just let him go! Let him go!

1283
01:19:33,101 --> 01:19:34,352
Truth be told,

1284
01:19:34,353 --> 01:19:36,980
we were gonna kill the other
couple at the restaurant.

1285
01:19:38,398 --> 01:19:39,399
But then...

1286
01:19:40,776 --> 01:19:43,320
- we saw that kiss.
- That kiss! God!

1287
01:19:44,029 --> 01:19:47,115
Your chemistry is undeniable.

1288
01:20:01,880 --> 01:20:05,007
Well, I didn't know that murder
was a love language.

1289
01:20:05,008 --> 01:20:06,093
Try it.

1290
01:20:06,927 --> 01:20:08,178
Maybe you'll like it.

1291
01:20:13,809 --> 01:20:15,018
Pick it up.

1292
01:20:16,937 --> 01:20:17,938
Pick it up.

1293
01:20:19,106 --> 01:20:21,148
There's a single bullet
in that chamber

1294
01:20:21,149 --> 01:20:23,652
with one single choice,
him or you.

1295
01:20:33,120 --> 01:20:34,745
We may have
mistaken you for lovers

1296
01:20:34,746 --> 01:20:37,624
at the beginning of the night,
but can you prove us right?

1297
01:20:38,333 --> 01:20:40,168
Could you save
his life with yours,

1298
01:20:40,169 --> 01:20:43,547
thus proving that love
really does conquer all?

1299
01:20:45,424 --> 01:20:47,926
If you don't love him, kill him.

1300
01:20:49,303 --> 01:20:50,637
And you're free to go.

1301
01:20:54,433 --> 01:20:55,434
Wow.

1302
01:20:58,145 --> 01:21:00,856
You know,
your dedication is impressive.

1303
01:21:03,609 --> 01:21:04,985
It's twisted as fuck, but--

1304
01:21:10,490 --> 01:21:11,658
Jay.

1305
01:21:14,745 --> 01:21:17,956
I've spent so long
running from love.

1306
01:21:20,542 --> 01:21:22,461
Convinced it would destroy me.

1307
01:21:30,219 --> 01:21:31,970
I don't wanna be
that person anymore.

1308
01:21:36,892 --> 01:21:38,685
I want the storybook thing.

1309
01:21:45,776 --> 01:21:48,320
It was just one single night...

1310
01:21:52,449 --> 01:21:54,284
but I fell hard for you, Jay.

1311
01:22:03,627 --> 01:22:06,838
No, no, no. Don't do that.

1312
01:22:06,839 --> 01:22:08,714
No! No, hey.

1313
01:22:08,715 --> 01:22:10,466
Hey. Hey, no.

1314
01:22:10,467 --> 01:22:12,845
- No, no! Ally!
- Forgive me.

1315
01:22:24,314 --> 01:22:25,691
Baby, no!

1316
01:22:26,775 --> 01:22:28,067
- Come on.
- Oh, you shot me.

1317
01:22:28,068 --> 01:22:30,069
Sorry, I overcorrected.

1318
01:22:30,070 --> 01:22:31,488
That's a lucky fucking shot.

1319
01:22:39,538 --> 01:22:41,915
Ally, did you mean
what you said?

1320
01:22:43,083 --> 01:22:44,084
Come on.

1321
01:22:44,710 --> 01:22:46,003
Pookie.

1322
01:22:46,837 --> 01:22:48,296
Chop that pretty boy up.

1323
01:22:48,297 --> 01:22:49,922
I'm gonna have fun
with this one.

1324
01:22:49,923 --> 01:22:52,174
- No. No.
- Oh, yes, Mommy.

1325
01:22:52,175 --> 01:22:55,303
No! No!
Don't you fucking touch him! No!

1326
01:22:56,512 --> 01:22:57,513
No!

1327
01:22:58,181 --> 01:22:59,182
No!

1328
01:23:03,269 --> 01:23:05,021
You shouldn't
have shot me, bitch.

1329
01:23:14,655 --> 01:23:15,740
Hey, hey, come on.

1330
01:23:16,866 --> 01:23:18,034
Look at her go.

1331
01:23:21,787 --> 01:23:23,748
Oh, you don't wanna miss this,
do you?

1332
01:23:24,582 --> 01:23:26,124
Isn't she perfect?

1333
01:23:26,125 --> 01:23:27,376
You talk too much.

1334
01:23:44,519 --> 01:23:46,395
I'm gonna fucking kill you both.

1335
01:24:00,910 --> 01:24:02,119
You watching, Jay?

1336
01:24:03,496 --> 01:24:05,248
I want you to see her die.

1337
01:24:10,795 --> 01:24:12,255
Love hurts, bitch.

1338
01:25:36,172 --> 01:25:37,715
Your day fucking sucks.

1339
01:25:42,345 --> 01:25:43,346
Jay.

1340
01:25:44,180 --> 01:25:45,306
Jay. Hey.

1341
01:25:46,057 --> 01:25:47,058
Hey.

1342
01:25:47,892 --> 01:25:48,893
Hi, you.

1343
01:25:49,268 --> 01:25:50,269
Hey.

1344
01:25:55,358 --> 01:25:57,693
I think you got over
your fear of blood.

1345
01:25:59,904 --> 01:26:01,279
I'm gonna kill you.

1346
01:26:01,280 --> 01:26:03,074
I'll fucking kill you.

1347
01:26:03,574 --> 01:26:05,117
I'm gonna fucking kill you.

1348
01:26:18,756 --> 01:26:19,841
Planet saved.

1349
01:26:22,009 --> 01:26:23,219
Planet saved.

1350
01:26:49,036 --> 01:26:51,955
Now, if you told me that,
a year ago,

1351
01:26:51,956 --> 01:26:55,917
I'd be drinking
to the highest recorded sales

1352
01:26:55,918 --> 01:26:58,003
in Crystal Cane history,
I'd say,

1353
01:26:58,004 --> 01:27:00,755
"Y'all just a lying sack
of hot trash."

1354
01:27:00,756 --> 01:27:03,593
But... here we are.

1355
01:27:04,886 --> 01:27:08,472
And it's all thanks
to these two marketing mavens.

1356
01:27:12,059 --> 01:27:14,103
Right here. These two.

1357
01:27:15,146 --> 01:27:17,063
Now, Ally. I am,

1358
01:27:17,064 --> 01:27:18,815
believe it or not,
mildly devastated

1359
01:27:18,816 --> 01:27:20,526
that this is your last day.

1360
01:27:21,068 --> 01:27:23,904
But I am proud of you for going,
pursuing your dreams,

1361
01:27:23,905 --> 01:27:25,697
going back to doctor school.

1362
01:27:25,698 --> 01:27:28,158
All told, I really do hope
that you're better with a needle

1363
01:27:28,159 --> 01:27:29,785
than you are with a pitch deck!

1364
01:27:32,580 --> 01:27:33,872
To success!

1365
01:27:33,873 --> 01:27:35,749
- To success!
- To success.

1366
01:27:35,750 --> 01:27:36,834
Wait.

1367
01:27:38,461 --> 01:27:39,462
To love.

1368
01:27:46,552 --> 01:27:47,553
Hey, baby.

1369
01:27:48,137 --> 01:27:49,138
Hi.

1370
01:27:50,097 --> 01:27:51,139
What did I miss?

1371
01:27:51,140 --> 01:27:53,308
Hey, do you think it's weird
having a date here

1372
01:27:53,309 --> 01:27:55,101
after everything that happened?

1373
01:27:55,102 --> 01:27:56,479
Nope. Not to me.

1374
01:27:57,355 --> 01:27:59,857
This is where I realized
that I was in love with you.

1375
01:28:00,191 --> 01:28:02,526
So, feels symbolic.

1376
01:28:02,527 --> 01:28:04,153
Okay. Symbolic?

1377
01:28:04,779 --> 01:28:06,030
You think it's symb--

1378
01:28:07,240 --> 01:28:09,908
Listen, don't freak out.
Don't freak out.

1379
01:28:09,909 --> 01:28:12,370
I know stuff like this
can freak you out, but...

1380
01:28:15,206 --> 01:28:17,333
Ally, this has been
the best year of my life.

1381
01:28:19,585 --> 01:28:20,586
So...

1382
01:28:22,588 --> 01:28:24,090
will you move in with me?

1383
01:28:33,391 --> 01:28:34,392
Jay, I--

1384
01:28:36,519 --> 01:28:37,728
I don't know what to say.

1385
01:28:39,063 --> 01:28:41,815
Yeah, no. I--I know
where that's going.

1386
01:28:41,816 --> 01:28:43,191
- It's okay.
- No, I--

1387
01:28:43,192 --> 01:28:44,443
I don't want a key.

1388
01:28:47,113 --> 01:28:48,114
I don't want a key.

1389
01:28:52,535 --> 01:28:53,536
I want you.

1390
01:29:07,425 --> 01:29:08,676
Jay Simmonds...

1391
01:29:11,512 --> 01:29:12,638
will you marry me?

1392
01:29:24,066 --> 01:29:25,067
Yes.

1393
01:29:26,027 --> 01:29:27,611
- Yes?
- Yes. Yes.

1394
01:29:27,612 --> 01:29:31,032
A million fucking times, yes.

1395
01:31:24,770 --> 01:31:25,770
Hello?

1396
01:31:25,771 --> 01:31:27,105
<i>Roses are red,</i>

1397
01:31:27,106 --> 01:31:28,983
<i>violets are blue.</i>

1398
01:31:30,067 --> 01:31:33,112
<i>Guess who just took
a picture of you?</i>

1399
01:31:33,821 --> 01:31:34,822
Who is this?

1400
01:31:36,073 --> 01:31:37,282
Relax, bitch.

1401
01:31:37,283 --> 01:31:38,366
<i>Too soon?</i>

1402
01:31:38,367 --> 01:31:40,327
Monica, that's not funny!

1403
01:31:40,328 --> 01:31:41,913
Where even are you?

1404
01:31:42,788 --> 01:31:43,788
Did you get it?

1405
01:31:43,789 --> 01:31:45,290
Of course, I got it.
Are you kidding me?

1406
01:31:45,291 --> 01:31:46,374
You look super cute.

1407
01:31:46,375 --> 01:31:47,959
I mean,
I would have gotten a manicure,

1408
01:31:47,960 --> 01:31:49,586
but I told you that,
and you're fine with that.

1409
01:31:49,587 --> 01:31:51,713
You're a natural gal.
You look great.

1410
01:31:51,714 --> 01:31:55,468
Okay, enjoy the movie, fiancés.
Love you.

1411
01:31:57,261 --> 01:31:59,138
Ally? Hello?
