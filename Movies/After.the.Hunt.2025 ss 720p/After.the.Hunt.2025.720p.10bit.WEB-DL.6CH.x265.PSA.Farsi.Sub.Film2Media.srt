I'm so sorry,

185
00:12:31,833 --> 00:12:33,041
'cause I just had, like,

186
00:12:33,125 --> 00:12:34,934
I had no idea that you were
going through this...

187
00:12:34,958 --> 00:12:36,875

so victimized.

never said that.

the fact that you're...

191
00:12:44,041 --> 00:12:47,666
white and male and, uh,

192
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:50,875

regrettably, cis...

193
00:12:50,958 --> 00:12:52,666

194
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:53,791

195
00:12:53,875 --> 00:12:55,750

it's pretend, right,

196
00:12:55,833 --> 00:12:57,833
pretending to not
prefer these things,

197
00:12:57,916 --> 00:12:59,458

-All I'm saying...

203
00:13:09,458 --> 00:13:10,976
is that it used to be
that a man would edge out

204
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,125
an equally qualified woman

205
00:13:12,208 --> 00:13:13,791
because he was a man.

206
00:13:13,875 --> 00:13:15,666
But now a woman
does just edge out

207
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:17,559

because she's a woman.

this group of guys there

885

Ulysses starts to cry.

what had actually happened."

himself as a hero
