Today is Thursday,
August 6th, 2015.

7
00:00:37,162 --> 00:00:39,706
I'm about to do an
interview on Sarah Corbett.

8
00:00:41,124 --> 00:00:43,959
Well, Sarah, did you know
why you're here today?

9
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:44,960
[Sarah] Yes.

10
00:00:44,961 --> 00:00:46,420
Tell me why you're here today.

11
00:00:46,421 --> 00:00:47,546
Because my dad died.

12
00:00:47,547 --> 00:00:48,547
Okay.

13
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:53,553
{\an8}Just have a seat for me.

14
00:00:54,554 --> 00:00:59,142
And, Jack, my name is Brandy, and
it's my job to talk to you today.

15
00:01:00,935 --> 00:01:03,020
You said your dad died.
What's your dad's name?

16
00:01:03,021 --> 00:01:06,024
Jason Paul Corbett.
C-O-R-B-E-T-T.

17
00:01:07,525 --> 00:01:09,068
[Brandy] What is
your mom's name?

18
00:01:09,069 --> 00:01:10,695
[Jack] Molly Martens.

19
00:01:12,655 --> 00:01:14,323
[Brandy] And what is
your grandpa's name?

20
00:01:14,324 --> 00:01:15,991
[Jack] His name is Tom Martens.

21
00:01:15,992 --> 00:01:17,618
[Brandy] Okay. And
what do you call him?

22
00:01:17,619 --> 00:01:19,161
I call him Grandpa Tom.

23
00:01:19,162 --> 00:01:20,579
Grandpa Tom. Okay.

I'm dead asleep in bed
when the phone rings.

46
00:02:23,977 --> 00:02:27,312
{\an8}As a detective, you know when that phone
rings at three o'clock in the morning,

47
00:02:27,313 --> 00:02:28,356
{\an8}it's never good.

48
00:02:29,816 --> 00:02:32,734
So, I'm out of the bed,
and I'm out the door,

49
00:02:32,735 --> 00:02:36,738
and I am headed to
Meadowlands in North Carolina.

00:02:36,739 --> 00:02:38,157
[indistinct radio chatter]

[crickets chirping]

52
00:02:40,034 --> 00:02:41,535
I go into the house,

53
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:44,163
and I look inside
the master bedroom,

54
00:02:44,164 --> 00:02:46,123
and it's pretty horrific.

55
00:02:46,124 --> 00:02:49,043
[camera clicking]

56
00:02:49,627 --> 00:02:53,131
It's one of the bloodiest crime
scenes I've seen in a long time.

57
00:02:55,175 --> 00:02:58,844
The female resident tells me
that her name is Molly Corbett...

[camera clicks]

59
00:03:01,014 --> 00:03:04,058
...and that the victim is
her husband, Jason Corbett.

60
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:10,731
[Wanda] These offices
are really cold.

61
00:03:10,732 --> 00:03:12,482
- [Molly] Thanks.
- You're welcome.

62
00:03:12,483 --> 00:03:14,569
[Tom grunts]

63
00:03:16,696 --> 00:03:19,115
[Wanda] All right. Tell
me what happened tonight.

64
00:03:20,408 --> 00:03:21,701
We were fighting.

65
00:03:22,202 --> 00:03:24,078
- Who was fighting?
- My husband.

66
00:03:25,163 --> 00:03:26,956
My daughter had a nightmare.

67
00:03:27,832 --> 00:03:30,668
She or I woke him
up, so he was angry.

68
00:03:31,836 --> 00:03:33,379
He choked me.

69
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:35,215
How did he choke you?

70
00:03:36,549 --> 00:03:39,594
First, with his hand pressed
really hard right here.

71
00:03:42,305 --> 00:03:45,557
He let go for a second,
and I screamed really loud.

72
00:03:45,558 --> 00:03:47,101
[Molly sniffles, exhales]

73
00:03:47,727 --> 00:03:50,812
I can't remember next
until my dad came in.

74
00:03:50,813 --> 00:03:51,730
[Wanda] Okay.

75
00:03:51,731 --> 00:03:57,528
I heard arguing and thumping
going on on the floor above me.

76
00:03:58,696 --> 00:04:00,406
And it... it sounded bad.

77
00:04:02,617 --> 00:04:05,328
I grabbed the bat,
and I ran upstairs.

78
00:04:06,204 --> 00:04:08,122
So, I open the bedroom door,

79
00:04:08,831 --> 00:04:11,876
and he's got Molly by
the throat like this.

80
00:04:12,543 --> 00:04:13,920
And he sees me coming,

81
00:04:14,921 --> 00:04:19,175
and he goes around
the throat like this.

82
00:04:20,385 --> 00:04:22,177
And I said, "Let her go."

83
00:04:22,178 --> 00:04:23,595
"I'm gonna kill her."

84
00:04:23,596 --> 00:04:25,138
- "Let her go."
- "I'm gonna kill her."

85
00:04:25,139 --> 00:04:27,182
And he started to drag
her towards the bedroom,

86
00:04:27,183 --> 00:04:29,893
into the, uh, bathroom.

87
00:04:29,894 --> 00:04:31,980
[tense music playing]

88
00:04:33,606 --> 00:04:34,606
And I hit him.

89
00:04:35,483 --> 00:04:37,567
I hit him with the baseball bat.

90
00:04:37,568 --> 00:04:40,112
And he reaches out,
and he grabs the bat.

91
00:04:40,113 --> 00:04:42,073
Jason got the baseball bat.

92
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:46,285
And... he tried to hit my dad.

93
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:49,080
I think he might
have missed, and...

94
00:04:50,915 --> 00:04:52,457
I... [sniffles]

95
00:04:52,458 --> 00:04:53,543
Um...

96
00:04:54,669 --> 00:04:56,211
I hit him on the head.

97
00:04:56,212 --> 00:04:57,879
You hit him on the
head with what?

98
00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:00,674
With... With a brick
on my nightstand.

99
00:05:00,675 --> 00:05:01,591
[Wanda] Okay.

100
00:05:01,592 --> 00:05:04,761
[Molly] I'm not sure. I hit him
on the head or the shoulder.

101
00:05:04,762 --> 00:05:06,805
[Wanda] How many times
did you hit Jason?

102
00:05:06,806 --> 00:05:08,099
I don't know.

103
00:05:08,599 --> 00:05:10,101
Okay. You don't remember?

104
00:05:11,227 --> 00:05:12,562
[crying] I don't know.

105
00:05:14,355 --> 00:05:16,523
I can't tell you how
many times I hit him.

106
00:05:16,524 --> 00:05:18,900
I can't tell you how
many times he shoved me.

107
00:05:18,901 --> 00:05:20,486
I can't tell you. I...

108
00:05:21,821 --> 00:05:23,489
'Cause it was a battle.

109
00:05:25,867 --> 00:05:30,121
[Wanda] These two people are telling us
they just were in a fight for their life.

110
00:05:30,913 --> 00:05:33,916
Her husband has
horrific injuries.

111
00:05:34,792 --> 00:05:37,378
And they don't
appear to have any.

112
00:05:38,129 --> 00:05:39,963
[camera clicking]

113
00:05:39,964 --> 00:05:43,551
In North Carolina, they have
a right to defend themselves.

114
00:05:44,969 --> 00:05:48,389
But are they the victims,
or is he the victim?

115

[music fades]

117
00:05:58,441 --> 00:06:01,944
[Wanda] You know your husband
didn't survive his injuries, right?

118
00:06:03,112 --> 00:06:05,072
I didn't... I didn't think so.

119
00:06:05,073 --> 00:06:07,657
[Wanda] No, he didn't
survive his injuries.

120
00:06:07,658 --> 00:06:10,370
[Sarah breathes deeply]

121
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:12,789
How long have you been together?

122
00:06:13,915 --> 00:06:16,542
Probably seven years.

123
00:06:18,378 --> 00:06:21,130
My children aren't
biologically my children.

124
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:25,385
They're his first wife's
children, and she died.

125
00:06:26,719 --> 00:06:30,680
Is there anybody that you need for us
to contact from your husband's family?

126
00:06:30,681 --> 00:06:31,766
[Molly] Oh God.

127
00:06:33,518 --> 00:06:35,894
[crying] What if I'm
scared of his family?

128
00:06:35,895 --> 00:06:37,105
[sobbing]

129
00:06:38,022 --> 00:06:40,482
I'm scared they'll
try to take the kids.

130
00:06:40,483 --> 00:06:41,650
[Wanda] Um...

131
00:06:41,651 --> 00:06:43,777
- You guys are legally married?
- Yes.

132
00:06:43,778 --> 00:06:46,196
- Did you adopt the children?
- No.

133
00:06:46,197 --> 00:06:48,532
Okay, then that's
a real possibility.

134
00:06:48,533 --> 00:06:49,700
[sobs] Oh!

135
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:51,993
Oh!

136
00:06:51,994 --> 00:06:54,079
[seagulls squawking]

137

[somber music playing]

138
00:07:01,671 --> 00:07:05,424
[phone vibrating]

139
00:07:05,425 --> 00:07:09,679
My brother got a call to
say that Jason was dead.

140
00:07:10,179 --> 00:07:12,139
{\an8}He and Molly had an argument.

141
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:16,310
{\an8}She pushed him, he fell,
hit his head, and died.

142
00:07:16,894 --> 00:07:20,981
So I immediately
started to call Molly,

143
00:07:20,982 --> 00:07:23,901
um, and I got no
answer at that time.

144
00:07:25,027 --> 00:07:28,448
I can't comprehend.
I can't process.

145
00:07:28,948 --> 00:07:31,534
You know, I just
couldn't believe it.

146
00:07:33,327 --> 00:07:36,205
Jason and I, we
were super close.

147
00:07:38,916 --> 00:07:40,543
We had a really big family.

148
00:07:41,586 --> 00:07:44,588
We grew up in
Janesboro in Limerick.

149
00:07:44,589 --> 00:07:48,384
And Jason and Wayne and
myself are the three youngest.

150
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:52,430
Jason remained a
constant best friend.

151
00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:57,350
When I had learned the news,

152
00:07:57,351 --> 00:08:00,855
my first thought was to the
welfare of Jack and Sarah.

153
00:08:03,983 --> 00:08:07,986
And so, within hours, I'm
packed and on the road

154
00:08:07,987 --> 00:08:11,907
to fly to America in order to
find out what happened to Jason

155
00:08:11,908 --> 00:08:14,160
and to make sure Jack
and Sarah are safe.

156
00:08:16,871 --> 00:08:20,499
{\an8}We just knew that we needed to get to
North Carolina as quickly as possible.

157
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:23,628
Myself and Tracey were named
as guardians in Jason's will.

158
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:27,255
I went straight to Jason's
solicitor's office.

159
00:08:27,256 --> 00:08:31,092
I collected the will and flew out
to America a couple of hours later.

160
00:08:31,093 --> 00:08:33,471
[pensive music playing]

161
00:08:38,059 --> 00:08:40,936
[Wanda] We start coordinating with
the district attorney's office

162
00:08:40,937 --> 00:08:44,023
about where the investigation
needs to go from here.

163
00:08:46,484 --> 00:08:47,817
[man] What
immediately strikes me

164
00:08:47,818 --> 00:08:51,988
{\an8}is that this is going to be a case
outside the normal of what we deal with.

165
00:08:51,989 --> 00:08:54,242
I'm a retired FBI agent.

166
00:08:54,825 --> 00:08:56,826
[detective] What did
you do with the FBI?

167
00:08:56,827 --> 00:08:59,664
First half of my
career was Criminal.

168
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:03,709
Second half of my career
was Counterintelligence.

169
00:09:04,418 --> 00:09:07,045
[Alan] Tom Martens is
a retired FBI agent,

170
00:09:07,046 --> 00:09:09,047
and he has been schooled in

171
00:09:09,048 --> 00:09:11,424
and has schooled other officers

172
00:09:11,425 --> 00:09:13,302
on the art of interrogation.

173
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:17,472
We would be remiss in our duties

174
00:09:17,473 --> 00:09:21,560
if we ever just accepted,
wholesale and without examination,

175
00:09:21,561 --> 00:09:24,104
what any person who's
killed somebody has to say.

176
00:09:24,105 --> 00:09:28,441
Perhaps it would be helpful if I
just kinda launched into the story.

177
00:09:28,442 --> 00:09:29,401
[detective] Okay.

178
00:09:29,402 --> 00:09:31,611
'Cause it will contribute
to my state of mind.

179
00:09:31,612 --> 00:09:32,529
[detective] Okay.

180
00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:36,408
I see Tom attempting to
control the narrative

181
00:09:36,409 --> 00:09:39,036
and present things the way
he wants to present them.

182
00:09:40,121 --> 00:09:46,794
Tom never admits that he
saw Molly hit Jason at all.

183
00:09:47,461 --> 00:09:51,048
[detective] At any point, did
Molly join in on the volley?

184
00:09:51,924 --> 00:09:56,429
When I lost control of the
bat and she wiggled out,

185
00:09:57,305 --> 00:09:59,764
she somehow distracted
him, but I don't know.

186
00:09:59,765 --> 00:10:02,184
I'm scrambling. I don't know.

187
00:10:02,685 --> 00:10:04,520
We find that hard to believe.

188
00:10:07,064 --> 00:10:09,941
The night of the incident,
I'm at the house,

189
00:10:09,942 --> 00:10:13,237
I learned that Molly's
mother was in the basement.

190
00:10:13,738 --> 00:10:15,823
So, we get a statement from her.

191
00:10:16,657 --> 00:10:18,283
Sharon Martens tells us

192
00:10:18,284 --> 00:10:21,077
{\an8}that they got awakened in the
middle of the night to a ruckus,

193
00:10:21,078 --> 00:10:22,872
{\an8}and she hears her
daughter scream.

194
00:10:24,123 --> 00:10:26,082
Her husband gets out of bed,

195
00:10:26,083 --> 00:10:28,793
goes upstairs to take care
of whatever the ruckus is,

196
00:10:28,794 --> 00:10:31,380
and she rolls over and
goes back to sleep.

197
00:10:33,966 --> 00:10:37,385
I'm... dumbfounded.

198
00:10:37,386 --> 00:10:39,304
Like, what
grandmother does that?

199
00:10:39,305 --> 00:10:40,640
What mother does that?

200
00:10:41,557 --> 00:10:45,810
[Alan] Sharon Martens is telling
us she never responded in any way

201
00:10:45,811 --> 00:10:49,314
to this horrible,
violent, explosive event

202
00:10:49,315 --> 00:10:53,109
that was happening right upstairs in
a house full of people that she loved.

203
00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:55,029
It just doesn't quite add up.

204
00:10:55,988 --> 00:10:59,116
We are also looking
at the 911 call.

205
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:00,700
[Molly] <i>...three, four.</i>

206
00:11:00,701 --> 00:11:03,536
- [Tom] <i>One, two, three, four. Good.</i>
- [Molly] <i>One, two, three, four.</i>

207
00:11:03,537 --> 00:11:06,206
<i>One, two, three, four. One...</i>

208
00:11:06,207 --> 00:11:10,168
[Alan] EMS workers are listening
to this recording and saying,

209
00:11:10,169 --> 00:11:12,379
"I don't think those
people are doing CPR."

210
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:13,463
It's too hard.

211
00:11:13,464 --> 00:11:17,551
You can't count out loud like that
with that precision, that rhythm.

212
00:11:18,135 --> 00:11:21,680
[Tom] <i>One... I'll count. I'll
count. One, two, three, four.</i>

213
00:11:21,681 --> 00:11:24,265
[Alan] EMS personnel
also describe

214
00:11:24,266 --> 00:11:27,352
that Jason's body was
cool to the touch,

215
00:11:27,353 --> 00:11:30,522
and one of them even
looked at another and said,

216
00:11:30,523 --> 00:11:32,525
"When did they
say he went down?"

217
00:11:33,109 --> 00:11:34,943
This is not scientific evidence,

218
00:11:34,944 --> 00:11:39,656
and there are sufficient variables
in how quickly a body cools,

219
00:11:39,657 --> 00:11:41,826
but it was compelling
information for us.

220
00:11:42,993 --> 00:11:46,287
[Wanda] Now there's a possibility
the Martens were thinking,

221
00:11:46,288 --> 00:11:49,541
"I've got to sit down
and get my story straight

222
00:11:49,542 --> 00:11:51,126
before I call the cops."

223
00:11:51,127 --> 00:11:53,212
[somber music playing]

224
00:11:57,758 --> 00:12:01,386
[Tracey] We found out that
within hours of Jason's death,

225
00:12:01,387 --> 00:12:04,639
Molly and Thomas
Martens returned home,

226
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:06,474
and at this point,

227
00:12:06,475 --> 00:12:11,689
the children are in the care and
control of Molly Martens and her family.

228
00:12:12,398 --> 00:12:16,693
Within 48 hours, the Martens
had filed for guardianship,

229
00:12:16,694 --> 00:12:20,281
adoption, and custody
of Jack and Sarah.

230
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:24,451
I asked to speak to them,
you know, on the phone,

231
00:12:24,452 --> 00:12:27,912
to have a supervised
visit, uh, anything.

232
00:12:27,913 --> 00:12:30,457
I just wanted to put
my arms around them.

233
00:12:30,458 --> 00:12:32,126
They had lost their father.

234
00:12:32,626 --> 00:12:35,921
And Molly would not allow it.

235
00:12:37,256 --> 00:12:40,925
There's all these things happening,
all at once, all colliding,

236
00:12:40,926 --> 00:12:43,679
and I want to see my brother.

237
00:12:45,347 --> 00:12:48,391
We spoke to the funeral director,
trying to get to see Jason,

238
00:12:48,392 --> 00:12:52,270
and he apologized profusely, but he
had been given clear instructions

239
00:12:52,271 --> 00:12:54,356
that we were not
allowed to view Jason.

240
00:12:55,649 --> 00:12:58,778
[Tracey] I believe that Molly's
trying to cremate Jason's body

241
00:12:59,737 --> 00:13:00,905
before I got there.

242
00:13:02,031 --> 00:13:05,242
I thought to myself,
"What have you done?"

243
00:13:08,746 --> 00:13:11,415
[Alan] Then we get the
results from the autopsy.

244
00:13:12,166 --> 00:13:15,294
And the autopsy findings...

245
00:13:17,505 --> 00:13:18,547
are horrific.

246
00:13:21,133 --> 00:13:24,761
Jason has abrasions
on his forehead,

247
00:13:24,762 --> 00:13:26,262
under his eye,

248
00:13:26,263 --> 00:13:27,681
his shoulder blades,

249
00:13:28,849 --> 00:13:32,102
and then... we get to his head.

250
00:13:34,730 --> 00:13:38,734
And in... 30 years
of prosecuting...

251
00:13:44,198 --> 00:13:46,534
I've never seen
photographs like these.

252
00:13:48,994 --> 00:13:50,079
He had...

253
00:13:53,249 --> 00:13:55,835
so many blows to his head

254
00:13:56,710 --> 00:14:00,214
that the pathologist
couldn't count them

255
00:14:01,465 --> 00:14:03,509
because they overlapped,

256
00:14:04,093 --> 00:14:06,762
and a chunk of Jason's skull

257
00:14:07,513 --> 00:14:09,348
fell out onto the table.

258
00:14:12,142 --> 00:14:16,146
It takes an incredible
amount of force

259
00:14:16,814 --> 00:14:18,773
to cause that kind of injury.

260
00:14:18,774 --> 00:14:19,899
[somber music playing]

261
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:21,652
[footsteps approaching]

262
00:14:23,904 --> 00:14:29,034
[Tracey] It's taken me four days of
legal action to see Jason's body.

263
00:14:30,077 --> 00:14:33,204
It's horrendous to see

264
00:14:33,205 --> 00:14:36,500
what one human being
can inflict on another.

265
00:14:38,836 --> 00:14:43,006
His children lay in a bedroom
just feet away from him,

266
00:14:43,007 --> 00:14:46,635
and I know his last thoughts
would have been with them.

267
00:14:49,305 --> 00:14:53,642
I hold his hand, and I promise him
that his children would be okay,

268
00:14:54,643 --> 00:14:58,272
and I promise that I would get
justice for what happened to him.

269
00:14:58,772 --> 00:15:00,190
[music ends]

270
00:15:06,530 --> 00:15:08,865
[Wanda] Jack and Sarah
were in the home,

271
00:15:08,866 --> 00:15:10,199
in bed asleep,

272
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:12,286
when this event occurred.

273
00:15:13,287 --> 00:15:15,204
We need to have them interviewed

274
00:15:15,205 --> 00:15:18,041
by people that are trained
to interview small children.

275
00:15:18,042 --> 00:15:22,630
So, they're taken to the
Dragonfly Child Advocacy Center.

276
00:15:25,633 --> 00:15:29,218
Let's just start with the very first
thing you told me, that your dad died.

277
00:15:29,219 --> 00:15:30,678
How did your dad die?

278
00:15:30,679 --> 00:15:33,349
Well, my sister had a nightmare

279
00:15:34,475 --> 00:15:36,225
about insects crawling.

280
00:15:36,226 --> 00:15:39,437
She had fairy blankets and
insects all over her bed.

281
00:15:39,438 --> 00:15:41,314
My dad got very mad,

282
00:15:41,315 --> 00:15:45,235
and he was screaming at my
mom, and Mom let out a scream,

283
00:15:46,028 --> 00:15:48,613
and my grandpa came up and
started to hit him with a bat.

284
00:15:48,614 --> 00:15:53,326
And then my dad grabbed a hold of the
bat, and hit my grandpa with the bat.

285
00:15:53,327 --> 00:15:57,080
And so my mom...
put her... like...

286
00:15:57,081 --> 00:16:00,833
We were going to paint a brick that
was in there, like, a cinder block,

287
00:16:00,834 --> 00:16:04,046
and it hit his
temple right here,

288
00:16:04,588 --> 00:16:05,421
and he died.

289
00:16:05,422 --> 00:16:06,339
[Brandy] Okay.

290
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:09,467
Now, your sister had a
nightmare. How did you know that?

291
00:16:09,468 --> 00:16:11,094
My pare... My mom told me.

292
00:16:11,095 --> 00:16:12,095
Okay.

293
00:16:12,763 --> 00:16:15,682
Did your mom and dad
fight before this?

294
00:16:15,683 --> 00:16:20,269
He gets very angry at my mom
for leaving one light on.

295
00:16:20,270 --> 00:16:24,065
- What would he do?
- He would... he would scream at her.

296
00:16:24,066 --> 00:16:26,442
Okay. Did you ever
see him hit her?

297
00:16:26,443 --> 00:16:27,736
Um...

298
00:16:28,445 --> 00:16:29,445
Once.

299
00:16:30,489 --> 00:16:33,033
He just got very mad
about simple things.

300
00:16:35,786 --> 00:16:38,329
- [Brandy] And who would he get mad at?
- My mom.

301
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:40,748
- Did you see him get mad at her?
- Yes.

302
00:16:40,749 --> 00:16:43,335
And when he would get
mad, what would he do?

303
00:16:44,503 --> 00:16:48,297
He would physically and verbally hurt
my... physically and verbally hurt my mom.

304
00:16:48,298 --> 00:16:50,258
Did you see him
physically hurt her?

305
00:16:50,259 --> 00:16:51,676
Um, once or twice.

306
00:16:51,677 --> 00:16:53,136
What did you see?

307
00:16:53,137 --> 00:16:57,266
Um, punching, hitting, pushing.

308
00:16:58,559 --> 00:17:02,103
[Alan] The children do both make
some statements about Jason.

309
00:17:02,104 --> 00:17:04,148
We have to pay close
attention to that.

310
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:06,941
But they also use a lot of words

311
00:17:06,942 --> 00:17:10,404
that eight-year-olds and
ten-year-olds don't generally use.

312
00:17:10,988 --> 00:17:14,699
He would physically and verbally hurt
my... physically and verbally hurt my mom.

313
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:16,326
That's unusual and stands out.

314
00:17:18,162 --> 00:17:20,372
And... And how do you
know she's afraid of him?

315
00:17:21,081 --> 00:17:22,206
She told us.

316
00:17:22,207 --> 00:17:24,751
[Sarah] No. My mom
told me about that.

317
00:17:24,752 --> 00:17:26,503
And who told you about that?

318
00:17:27,046 --> 00:17:28,588
Uh, my mom.

319
00:17:28,589 --> 00:17:30,298
My mom told me.

320
00:17:30,299 --> 00:17:31,340
She told me.

321
00:17:31,341 --> 00:17:32,592
[Brandy] Your mom told you.

322
00:17:32,593 --> 00:17:35,845
There's a possibility the
kids may have been coached.

323
00:17:35,846 --> 00:17:39,599
There's a lot of, "This is what
my mom told me about that night

324
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:42,811
and about things that had
happened in the past."

325
00:17:43,312 --> 00:17:44,729
My mom told me,

326
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:48,442
not when I was four, not when I was
five, but she told me when I was six,

327
00:17:49,193 --> 00:17:51,528
"Your dad is not
that good of a dad."

328
00:17:52,362 --> 00:17:54,323
[Alan] Why is she
saying that to Sarah?

329
00:17:55,532 --> 00:17:58,077
What is the truth
and what's not?

330
00:17:59,703 --> 00:18:02,289
We went back to Molly
and Tom's interviews.

331
00:18:04,333 --> 00:18:06,167
I know he's got me outmatched.

332
00:18:06,168 --> 00:18:07,877
I know he's a martial arts guy.

333
00:18:07,878 --> 00:18:09,504
I know he's a boxer.

334
00:18:09,505 --> 00:18:13,132
I am trying to stay a bat's
length away from this guy.

335
00:18:13,133 --> 00:18:14,133
[detective] Right.

336
00:18:14,134 --> 00:18:16,220
I'm scared to death.

337
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:20,640
[Wanda] We're trying to verify any
training that Jason may have had

338
00:18:20,641 --> 00:18:23,351
in karate or martial arts,

339
00:18:23,352 --> 00:18:25,354
any boxing training
that he may have had.

340
00:18:28,148 --> 00:18:30,650
[Tracey] Within one week
of Jason being killed,

341
00:18:30,651 --> 00:18:35,321
{\an8}I am contacted by the Davidson
County Sheriff's Department

342
00:18:35,322 --> 00:18:39,076
{\an8}asking questions like,
"Was Jason an MMA fighter?"

343
00:18:40,577 --> 00:18:42,162
"Was he a professional boxer?"

344
00:18:43,163 --> 00:18:46,666
"Was our family in the
Irish Republican Army?"

345
00:18:46,667 --> 00:18:47,708
[gun firing on TV]

346
00:18:47,709 --> 00:18:49,920
But, of course, these
things are ridiculous.

347
00:18:51,255 --> 00:18:55,717
They were just doing everything
they could to destroy his character.

348
00:18:57,136 --> 00:19:00,722
I want the world to know
the truth about Jason.

349
00:19:03,976 --> 00:19:07,019
[man] He was the most kind-hearted
person you could meet.

350
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:08,939
You'd never not see
the man smiling.

351
00:19:09,648 --> 00:19:10,648
{\an8}Everybody loved him.

352
00:19:10,649 --> 00:19:13,484
{\an8}Everybody loved Jason. He was
just... He was everybody's friend.

353
00:19:13,485 --> 00:19:15,571
[bright music playing]

354
00:19:17,489 --> 00:19:21,075
[Tracey] He was very charismatic,
and he had a loud voice as well.

355
00:19:21,076 --> 00:19:22,953
You knew when Jason was around.

356
00:19:23,745 --> 00:19:25,581
Family meant everything to him.

357
00:19:26,081 --> 00:19:28,708
I never thought he was
a romantic growing up,

358
00:19:28,709 --> 00:19:31,503
um, until he met his
first wife, Mags.

359
00:19:33,255 --> 00:19:37,342
[woman] We were out socializing one
night, and I introduced Mags to Jason.

360
00:19:37,843 --> 00:19:41,679
{\an8}And from the start, they were
just meant for each other.

361
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:43,556
{\an8}They were very, very happy.

362
00:19:43,557 --> 00:19:45,434
I, Margaret, take you, Jason,

363
00:19:45,934 --> 00:19:47,518
as my husband,

364
00:19:47,519 --> 00:19:50,397
for better, for worse,
for richer, for poorer,

365
00:19:51,315 --> 00:19:54,443
in sickness and in health,
all the days of our lives.

366
00:19:56,361 --> 00:19:57,653
[David] They'd
built their house.

367
00:19:57,654 --> 00:20:00,698
Mags had opened a new crèche, and
Jason had got promoted in work,

368
00:20:00,699 --> 00:20:02,116
so life couldn't
have been better.

369
00:20:02,117 --> 00:20:03,368
It was like a fairy tale.

370
00:20:04,036 --> 00:20:06,454
And Jason's kids were
everything to him.

371
00:20:06,455 --> 00:20:09,373
When they were born, he was just
the happiest he's ever been.

372
00:20:09,374 --> 00:20:12,084
That's it. Good
boy. I love Sarah.

373
00:20:12,085 --> 00:20:14,670
- Aw! You're the best boy, Jack.
- [Mags] Who's that, Jack?

374
00:20:14,671 --> 00:20:17,299
[Jason] Jack, do you know what...
do you know what Sarah told me?

375
00:20:17,841 --> 00:20:22,094
She said she's getting Jack a
tractor and a trailer as a present

376
00:20:22,095 --> 00:20:23,304
because you're her brother.

377
00:20:23,305 --> 00:20:25,057
'Cause she loves Jack.

378
00:20:26,058 --> 00:20:28,852
Get off my chair.
Get off my chair.

379
00:20:29,937 --> 00:20:32,773
This was the beginning
of his whole life.

380
00:20:33,357 --> 00:20:34,566
{\an8}What you doin'?

381
00:20:35,108 --> 00:20:36,150
You dancin'?

382
00:20:36,151 --> 00:20:38,237
[music continues]

383
00:20:39,821 --> 00:20:42,866
[Lynn] All that changed
drastically when I got a phone call

384
00:20:43,825 --> 00:20:47,995
at home one night, telling me that
Mags had had an asthma attack.

385
00:20:47,996 --> 00:20:50,082
[tense music playing]

386
00:20:50,832 --> 00:20:53,585
Myself and my husband managed
to get to the hospital.

387
00:20:54,711 --> 00:20:57,506
And Jason was with Mags,
and we could hear him...

388
00:21:00,342 --> 00:21:01,259
[inhaling deeply]

389
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:03,053
He just begged her not to go

390
00:21:04,388 --> 00:21:05,514
and leave him.

391
00:21:07,057 --> 00:21:11,270
Jason, in that
moment, was just...

392
00:21:12,104 --> 00:21:13,562
broken into pieces.

393
00:21:13,563 --> 00:21:15,649
[somber music playing]

394
00:21:16,733 --> 00:21:20,904
He would write letters to Mags and
then leave them at the grave site.

395
00:21:25,617 --> 00:21:27,410
{\an8}All of our family
rallied around,

396
00:21:27,411 --> 00:21:30,913
{\an8}but obviously, he had very
little space to grieve.

397
00:21:30,914 --> 00:21:33,833
{\an8}He was a single
parent of two babies,

398
00:21:33,834 --> 00:21:36,086
{\an8}and he had to go
to work every day.

399
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:43,427
So, he advertised
for an au pair,

400
00:21:43,927 --> 00:21:48,432
and that's when Molly
Martens came into our lives.

401
00:21:49,182 --> 00:21:51,184
[somber music continues]

402
00:21:55,105 --> 00:21:59,859
I was in my early 20s, and I'd been
in a relationship for several months

403
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:03,696
{\an8}and, um, unexpectedly
got pregnant,

404
00:22:03,697 --> 00:22:05,532
{\an8}and, um...

405
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:09,452
shortly thereafter,
suffered a miscarriage.

406
00:22:09,453 --> 00:22:12,872
And I think anybody who's
suffered a miscarriage

407
00:22:12,873 --> 00:22:16,625
can understand that that
is devastating at the time.

408
00:22:16,626 --> 00:22:18,545
I, um...

409
00:22:19,379 --> 00:22:21,297
was in that relationship
with someone,

410
00:22:21,298 --> 00:22:25,301
and I realized I didn't want to
spend my life with that someone,

411
00:22:25,302 --> 00:22:28,471
and I felt like that might
be easier if I got away

412
00:22:28,472 --> 00:22:30,222
and enjoy the world.

413
00:22:30,223 --> 00:22:33,309
And for me, working with
children was a natural choice.

414
00:22:33,310 --> 00:22:36,687
And so, I joined
an au pair agency.

415
00:22:36,688 --> 00:22:40,274
And when Jason
reached out to me,

416
00:22:40,275 --> 00:22:44,445
he indicated on his profile
that he had lost his wife.

417
00:22:44,446 --> 00:22:46,697
I guess that just pulled
on my heartstrings.

418
00:22:46,698 --> 00:22:48,532
There were these two babies

419
00:22:48,533 --> 00:22:50,409
{\an8}without a mother,

420
00:22:50,410 --> 00:22:53,830
{\an8}and maybe I had an
ache to fill that need.

421
00:22:55,082 --> 00:22:58,293
{\an8}It was only natural that
she would develop a talent

422
00:22:58,877 --> 00:23:01,754
{\an8}for taking care
of young children,

423
00:23:01,755 --> 00:23:04,758
in that her two younger brothers

424
00:23:05,467 --> 00:23:09,804
came along as she was nearing the
age where she could help her mother.

425
00:23:09,805 --> 00:23:12,891
She was very good
at engaging them.

426
00:23:14,017 --> 00:23:18,647
I arrived in Ireland on,
um, a traditional rainy day.

427
00:23:19,147 --> 00:23:23,109
And I met Jason, and
he put me at ease.

428
00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:24,276
[gentle music playing]

429
00:23:24,277 --> 00:23:26,238
He was charming, funny.

430
00:23:26,947 --> 00:23:28,657
He made me feel very special.

431
00:23:30,450 --> 00:23:33,786
[Tracey] Molly hadn't been
in the country too long

432
00:23:33,787 --> 00:23:35,871
when I began to
pick up on things,

433
00:23:35,872 --> 00:23:39,834
just little signals
between Jason and Molly.

434
00:23:39,835 --> 00:23:42,336
We were walking on the beach,
and they were dropping behind us,

435
00:23:42,337 --> 00:23:44,130
and I think Tracey
mentioned to me

436
00:23:44,131 --> 00:23:46,757
that, you know, she thought there
was more to the relationship

437
00:23:46,758 --> 00:23:48,343
than employer-employee.

438
00:23:48,885 --> 00:23:54,682
I felt like I was bringing joy
into Jack, Sarah, and Jason's life.

439
00:23:54,683 --> 00:23:56,684
[Molly] Okay, go
get your sandal.

440
00:23:56,685 --> 00:23:57,685
[Sarah babbling]

441
00:23:57,686 --> 00:23:59,770
[Molly] You gotta put
them on over your tight...

442
00:23:59,771 --> 00:24:00,688
Hello.

443
00:24:00,689 --> 00:24:03,399
...'cause it's the warmest day in
Ireland and you still need tights.

444
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:05,234
Sarah, how old are you?

445
00:24:05,235 --> 00:24:06,318
Two.

446
00:24:06,319 --> 00:24:08,446
- [Molly] Two and a half.
- Yeah.

447
00:24:08,447 --> 00:24:09,697
[Molly] How old are you?

448
00:24:09,698 --> 00:24:10,781
Four and a half.

449
00:24:10,782 --> 00:24:13,409
- Are you sure you're not one and a half?
- No.

450
00:24:13,410 --> 00:24:14,578
[Molly] Are you sure?

451
00:24:15,203 --> 00:24:17,830
But that noise you make, sometimes
it kinda sounds like this...

452
00:24:17,831 --> 00:24:19,165
[mimics a crying baby]

453
00:24:19,166 --> 00:24:21,376
That's kinda like a
one-and-a-half-year-old.

454
00:24:22,335 --> 00:24:26,798
And it was in the very early days
that Sarah started calling me "Mom."

455
00:24:27,299 --> 00:24:32,011
I was really becoming
a mother to those kids

456
00:24:32,012 --> 00:24:34,973
before I became a
mother to those kids.

457
00:24:36,016 --> 00:24:37,684
It was just wonderful.

458
00:24:39,311 --> 00:24:41,812
[Tracey] Molly made Jason smile,

459
00:24:41,813 --> 00:24:43,982
and he hadn't in
a very long time.

460
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:50,279
But it was clear from
emails from Jason to Molly

461
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:55,035
that Jason wanted to slow the
pace of their relationship down.

462
00:24:56,745 --> 00:24:59,121
"My concern is for
Jack and Sarah."

463
00:24:59,122 --> 00:25:01,832
"They have had enough
tragedy in their short lives,

464
00:25:01,833 --> 00:25:04,418
and while I know that
they are resilient,

465
00:25:04,419 --> 00:25:07,505
I'm nervous about putting them
through anything further."

466
00:25:07,506 --> 00:25:09,507
"I'm really scared, Molly."

467
00:25:09,508 --> 00:25:10,925
"I don't want to lose you,

468
00:25:10,926 --> 00:25:13,969
but more so, I don't want
to risk Jack and Sarah

469
00:25:13,970 --> 00:25:16,598
losing another mother
if we don't work out."

470
00:25:18,141 --> 00:25:21,769
But Molly always wanted
the relationship validated.

471
00:25:21,770 --> 00:25:24,564
And she's pushing,
pushing, pushing.

472
00:25:32,739 --> 00:25:37,368
Eventually, Jason began to
talk about the opportunity

473
00:25:37,369 --> 00:25:39,954
to begin a new life
for Jack and Sarah,

474
00:25:39,955 --> 00:25:43,207
to allow them to have a
stable family environment

475
00:25:43,208 --> 00:25:45,502
with a mother and father.

476
00:25:47,462 --> 00:25:50,798
I was on a regular night
out with my friends.

477
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:53,385
Jason walked in first, and
Molly walked in behind,

478
00:25:53,969 --> 00:25:56,178
showing the ring on her finger.

479
00:25:56,179 --> 00:25:59,723
And I said, "I am delighted.
I want you to be happy."

480
00:25:59,724 --> 00:26:01,476
"Mags wouldn't want
you to be miserable."

481
00:26:03,061 --> 00:26:06,021
[Molly] Ultimately, we decided
to move to the United States.

482
00:26:06,022 --> 00:26:09,275
Mostly, it was the lifestyle,

483
00:26:09,276 --> 00:26:13,654
and in particular, the lifestyle
in regard to raising children.

484
00:26:13,655 --> 00:26:15,197
[bright music playing]

485
00:26:15,198 --> 00:26:17,157
{\an8}[birds chirping]

486
00:26:17,158 --> 00:26:19,953
{\an8}I was excited about a new
beginning for our family.

487
00:26:21,955 --> 00:26:23,498
[birds chirping]

488
00:26:30,005 --> 00:26:33,258
My first time seeing the house,
I thought it was like a mansion.

489
00:26:36,303 --> 00:26:37,469
It was so cool.

490
00:26:37,470 --> 00:26:39,555
Everything was much
bigger than Ireland,

491
00:26:39,556 --> 00:26:40,765
which I loved.

492
00:26:42,058 --> 00:26:43,934
I remember when I first went in,

493
00:26:43,935 --> 00:26:46,645
I went into my room and started
running around in circles.

494
00:26:46,646 --> 00:26:48,564
And I loved how
big the garden was,

495
00:26:48,565 --> 00:26:51,526
'cause my dad told me we could
get a trampoline and a dog.

496
00:26:53,069 --> 00:26:54,069
It was just really happy.

497
00:26:54,070 --> 00:26:56,155
Everyone was excited
for this new adventure.

498
00:26:56,156 --> 00:26:57,991
We just moved to America.

499
00:27:02,412 --> 00:27:04,622
{\an8}[Jack] I feel like we
fit in straightaway

500
00:27:04,623 --> 00:27:07,709
when we moved over to
Meadowlands in North Carolina.

501
00:27:08,209 --> 00:27:10,961
We got straight into
activities like swimming,

502
00:27:10,962 --> 00:27:12,546
joining teams.

503
00:27:12,547 --> 00:27:15,008
Everyone there was
so nice, so friendly.

504
00:27:16,259 --> 00:27:18,720
It was a great
community to be part of.

505
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:25,351
[Tracey] After Molly, Jason, Jack,
and Sarah moved to North Carolina,

506
00:27:25,352 --> 00:27:28,270
within a couple of weeks,
there was going to be a wedding

507
00:27:28,271 --> 00:27:32,232
and just a joyous occasion that
we were looking forward to.

508
00:27:32,233 --> 00:27:36,153
We just wanted Jason to be happy,
and we traveled to support him.

509
00:27:36,154 --> 00:27:37,613
[exciting music playing]

510
00:27:37,614 --> 00:27:39,449
When we arrived,
everyone was excited.

511

[Brendan] Jason and Molly
had loads planned for us.

513
00:27:45,330 --> 00:27:46,581
We went to NASCAR,

514
00:27:48,041 --> 00:27:49,291
barbecues,

515
00:27:49,292 --> 00:27:50,959
loads of games, loads of fun.

off straightaway.

532
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:30,499
[Tracey] The next
day, at the wedding,

533
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:33,043
it started to become
apparent to me

534
00:28:33,044 --> 00:28:35,004
that there was something amiss

535
00:28:35,797 --> 00:28:40,343
when I had a conversation
with the maid of honor, Susie.

536
00:28:41,803 --> 00:28:43,721
[Susie] I had a speech prepared.

537
00:28:43,722 --> 00:28:47,516
{\an8}Before I was supposed to give
it, I was talking to Tracey,

538
00:28:47,517 --> 00:28:50,395
just telling her, you know,
it's just like a fairy tale.

539
00:28:50,895 --> 00:28:54,398
She starts to say how amazing
it all is and how romantic.

540
00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:56,735
You know, Molly goes over there

541
00:28:57,318 --> 00:29:00,362
to be the godparent
to Jason's kids,

542
00:29:00,363 --> 00:29:03,407
since she was childhood
friends with Mags.

543
00:29:03,408 --> 00:29:04,700
What?

544
00:29:04,701 --> 00:29:08,705
And now, like, you know,
she's gonna be their stepmom.

545
00:29:09,205 --> 00:29:11,875
I... I don't know what
you're talking about.

546
00:29:12,417 --> 00:29:14,377
Uh, she was the au pair.

547
00:29:14,878 --> 00:29:16,295
I'm like, "What?" [scoffs]

548
00:29:16,296 --> 00:29:18,047
Like, "You gotta be kidding me."

549
00:29:19,174 --> 00:29:20,924
[David] We're just in disbelief

550
00:29:20,925 --> 00:29:24,220
that this is what the American
contingent of the wedding believe.

551
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:28,599
Why would anybody create
this fabricated story?

552
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:30,226
[suspicious music playing]

[music fades]

555
00:29:35,857 --> 00:29:38,066
[Alan] In the course
of the investigation,

556
00:29:38,067 --> 00:29:41,361
we are interviewing
people about Molly.

557
00:29:41,362 --> 00:29:44,073
Her friends, her
family, her neighbors.

558
00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:50,079
And what we are learning
becomes full-on bizarre.

559
00:29:50,872 --> 00:29:54,374
[Wanda] One of the neighbors tells
us that she was part of a book club,

560
00:29:54,375 --> 00:29:57,044
and one of the ladies comes in

561
00:29:57,045 --> 00:30:00,756
and is just excited about
finding out she's pregnant.

562
00:30:00,757 --> 00:30:02,299
[pensive music playing]

563
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:07,513
Allegedly, Molly starts telling
everybody this whole drawn-out story

564
00:30:07,514 --> 00:30:10,141
about how she gave
birth to Sarah.

565
00:30:11,518 --> 00:30:15,312
And some of the people in the room
already knew that wasn't true.

566
00:30:15,313 --> 00:30:18,817
And yet, the story was being told
to other people in front of them.

567
00:30:21,069 --> 00:30:25,656
And she had told her college
roommate about a dead sister,

568
00:30:25,657 --> 00:30:27,867
and that her sister
had died of cancer.

569
00:30:29,285 --> 00:30:31,204
We found that's also not true.

570
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:35,959
So, she is fabricating a story
about a sister that doesn't exist.

571
00:30:37,710 --> 00:30:40,420
[Alan] Why does it matter
that, on so many occasions,

572
00:30:40,421 --> 00:30:44,884
Molly has told so many things
that are clearly not true?

573
00:30:45,718 --> 00:30:49,722
It matters because there were only
three people in that room that night.

574
00:30:50,348 --> 00:30:52,057
Jason can't tell his story.

575
00:30:52,058 --> 00:30:54,978
The two people who are
left are Tom and Molly.

576
00:30:55,770 --> 00:30:59,774
And we come to the conclusion
that Molly is not credible.

577
00:31:03,903 --> 00:31:06,281
Another thing that
comes to light

578
00:31:07,365 --> 00:31:11,535
is Molly's consistent demand

579
00:31:11,536 --> 00:31:14,539
to be able to adopt
Jason's children.

580
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,959
Just months after the wedding,

581
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:23,923
she had visited a divorce attorney to
explore her rights to the children.

582
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:28,552
I wanted to adopt them
because they were my children.

583
00:31:28,553 --> 00:31:33,308
I mean, I was their mommy. I was
their mama. They were my kiddos.

584
00:31:34,642 --> 00:31:38,937
Jason and I had spoke previously
of an adoption ceremony

585
00:31:38,938 --> 00:31:41,231
being part of the
wedding ceremony.

586
00:31:41,232 --> 00:31:43,233
There were a lot of
promises that were broken,

587
00:31:43,234 --> 00:31:44,819
but that was a big one.

588
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:46,945
[Tom] I brought it
up several times

589
00:31:46,946 --> 00:31:49,656
and say, "Where are we
on the adoption process?"

590
00:31:49,657 --> 00:31:51,241
"Anything I can do to help out?"

591
00:31:51,242 --> 00:31:53,452
And he would say, well, you
know, he's working on it,

592
00:31:53,453 --> 00:31:56,872
and, um, then
nothing would happen.

593
00:31:56,873 --> 00:31:58,958
[gentle music playing]

594
00:32:01,002 --> 00:32:05,505
[David] Looking back on the correspondence
that we got access to after Jason's death,

595
00:32:05,506 --> 00:32:07,925
we realized Jason was trying to
follow through on his promise

596
00:32:07,926 --> 00:32:10,136
to allow Molly to
adopt the children.

597
00:32:12,388 --> 00:32:15,433
We saw an email from
Jason to an attorney.

598
00:32:18,144 --> 00:32:21,439
I think one line stands out in
the email from the attorneys.

599
00:32:31,157 --> 00:32:33,117
Jason would never
take that risk.

Molly telling me that

00:33:00,728 --> 00:33:03,438
Tracey and David were
trying to take us away,

609
00:33:03,439 --> 00:33:05,482
and that she was going to court.

610
00:33:05,483 --> 00:33:07,318
And she told me that
she was winning.

611
00:33:07,944 --> 00:33:11,446
[Jack] Molly was telling us about
the new life we're going to have.

612
00:33:11,447 --> 00:33:13,865
She was already
looking at apartments,

613
00:33:13,866 --> 00:33:16,577
looking at new cars, new
schools we were going to.

There's no dual citizenship.</i>

617
00:33:27,839 --> 00:33:29,716
{\an8}<i>They're solely Irish citizens.</i>

618
00:33:30,216 --> 00:33:32,426
We presented evidence
that I was a mother,

619
00:33:32,427 --> 00:33:34,636
and clearly was the mother.

620
00:33:34,637 --> 00:33:37,014
I'm the one that took them
to all their appointments,

621
00:33:37,015 --> 00:33:41,685
and took care of meals, and did
all the day-to-day activities.

622
00:33:41,686 --> 00:33:44,938
And I feel like we proved
that without a doubt,

623
00:33:44,939 --> 00:33:49,193
and their home environment was with
me and that they were safe and stable.

"Well, Jason wanted his children to be
in Ireland with their family." What?

where he thought he was gonna die,

that I was taken from Molly.

A police car pulled
up outside the house,

643
00:34:54,258 --> 00:34:55,759
and two policemen hopped out,

644
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:59,137
and a van came up behind
them with two people in it.

[police radio chatter]

646
00:35:00,973 --> 00:35:05,019
They told me that there had been
a court order to remove the kids.

647
00:35:06,479 --> 00:35:08,772
You know, Jack was kicking
and screaming and saying,

648
00:35:08,773 --> 00:35:11,024
"I'm not leaving with you.
I'm not leaving with you."

649
00:35:11,025 --> 00:35:12,275
"I'm not going,"

650
00:35:12,276 --> 00:35:13,902
and "You can't take me."

651
00:35:13,903 --> 00:35:17,198
And Sarah was crying.

652
00:35:19,367 --> 00:35:23,870
I remember I was holding Jack's hand,
and I asked them, "Where are we going?"

653
00:35:23,871 --> 00:35:27,041
"Who are you? Take us back.
Where are you taking us?"

654
00:35:29,377 --> 00:35:33,714
And I was... I was melting down,
and, you know, I was crying,

655
00:35:34,298 --> 00:35:37,592
um, but I was trying
to hold it together.

656
00:35:37,593 --> 00:35:41,138
I was trying to make sense of this,
and I was trying to... I don't know.

and saying "I love you" to her,

661
00:36:02,743 --> 00:36:05,036

that she loved me.

I was a ten-year-old kid,

and this was the only person that
had been there every single day.

I loved Molly.

[Molly] It was not a goodbye
for me, it was just a visit,

there was just a huge media frenzy
around our family and my dad.

{\an8}[melancholy music playing]

679
00:36:56,839 --> 00:36:59,925
{\an8}It was just a shock to see
so many people interested,

680
00:36:59,926 --> 00:37:02,094
and it being such a
high-profile case back home.

681
00:37:04,972 --> 00:37:07,015
I had made a promise to Jason

682
00:37:07,016 --> 00:37:11,853
that I would make sure that
he would be buried with Mags.

683

[church bell tolling]

684
00:37:15,024 --> 00:37:17,817
[Jack] There were so many people
there that loved and supported my dad,

685
00:37:17,818 --> 00:37:19,486
and supported all of us.

686
00:37:19,487 --> 00:37:23,365
And for the last, like, 200 meters,
we walked behind the casket.

[somber music playing]

688
00:37:28,579 --> 00:37:31,706
It was just hard to know that
I'm never going to see him again.

689
00:37:31,707 --> 00:37:36,045
[somber music continues]

690
00:37:44,053 --> 00:37:48,306
I remember holding Sarah in my arms
in bed at night, and she's asking me,

691
00:37:48,307 --> 00:37:51,351
how did she lose, you
know, three parents.

692
00:37:51,352 --> 00:37:54,312
I wanted to trust Tracey
and David. I really did.

693
00:37:54,313 --> 00:37:55,981
And I remember
thinking about that.

694
00:37:55,982 --> 00:37:57,650
I remember thinking to myself,

695
00:37:58,359 --> 00:38:00,986
"You should just trust them.
You know they love you."

696
00:38:00,987 --> 00:38:04,115
But I found it really
hard to let myself

697
00:38:04,699 --> 00:38:06,534
because I didn't want
to get hurt again.

698
00:38:08,536 --> 00:38:13,416
[Tracey] We were dealing with just two
completely traumatized little children.

699
00:38:14,333 --> 00:38:19,547
And they just needed me to be a
mother, and that's what I did.

700
00:38:20,673 --> 00:38:23,925
I suppose we were lucky that myself and
Tracey had trained as foster parents.

701
00:38:23,926 --> 00:38:25,760
We knew what needed to
happen to the two kids

702
00:38:25,761 --> 00:38:27,178
in order for them
to move forward,

703
00:38:27,179 --> 00:38:30,558
and counseling was going to be a
very important part of their healing.

[phone ringing]

705
00:38:35,021 --> 00:38:37,522
[Molly] The family
wouldn't allow any contact.

706
00:38:37,523 --> 00:38:39,816
They wouldn't answer any calls.

[phone continues ringing]

708
00:38:42,278 --> 00:38:46,156
And so, I used social media

709
00:38:46,157 --> 00:38:48,825
{\an8}to send messages to my kids.

{\an8}[David] It was just
a constant barrage.

722
00:39:30,868 --> 00:39:33,578
We were trying to build a
safe environment for them,

723
00:39:33,579 --> 00:39:37,040
and they were attempting
to undo everything.

724

We don't want them
contacting these children.

725
00:39:38,876 --> 00:39:41,127
These are the people that
have killed their father.

726

[music continues]

727
00:39:51,263 --> 00:39:54,558
[Wanda] We were waiting for the
results of the toxicology report

728
00:39:55,101 --> 00:39:59,771
because we had been told in the
initial stages of the investigation

729
00:39:59,772 --> 00:40:02,233
that Jason was quite drunk.

730
00:40:02,983 --> 00:40:04,526
I know he'd been drinking.

731
00:40:04,527 --> 00:40:09,156
I mean, he was wild.

732
00:40:09,657 --> 00:40:12,158
[Wanda] Would you say that
you thought he was drunk?

733
00:40:12,159 --> 00:40:13,993
Yes, he was drunk.

734
00:40:13,994 --> 00:40:16,622
It wasn't just sloppy drunk.

735
00:40:17,248 --> 00:40:19,833
{\an8}Now we have definitive
scientific evidence

736
00:40:19,834 --> 00:40:22,044
{\an8}that this was not true.

737
00:40:24,296 --> 00:40:26,424
The number is .02.

738
00:40:26,966 --> 00:40:30,343
It's legal to drive in
North Carolina to .08.

739
00:40:30,344 --> 00:40:33,222
At the time he died,
he was not drunk.

740
00:40:35,057 --> 00:40:37,183
In addition to a
little bit of alcohol,

741
00:40:37,184 --> 00:40:41,896
Jason has some of Molly's
sleep medication tranquilizer

742
00:40:41,897 --> 00:40:42,897
in his system.

743
00:40:44,066 --> 00:40:45,859
{\an8}[Wanda] Did he take
it voluntarily,

744
00:40:45,860 --> 00:40:47,944
or was it given to him
without his knowledge?

745
00:40:47,945 --> 00:40:52,199
That's a question that we probably
will never be able to answer.

746
00:40:53,367 --> 00:40:58,079
But it's setting off flags for me
as to what really happened here.

about where this fight
happened and how it happened,

750
00:41:05,588 --> 00:41:07,214
it didn't make any sense.

751
00:41:07,715 --> 00:41:10,758
It turned out to be defensive
to have her in front,

752
00:41:10,759 --> 00:41:12,469
to have her between us.

753
00:41:12,470 --> 00:41:14,387
He's holding her
in front of him.

754
00:41:14,388 --> 00:41:16,097
I'm afraid I'm going to hit her.

755
00:41:16,098 --> 00:41:20,351
I kept trying to get
around and distract him,

756
00:41:20,352 --> 00:41:22,228
and get him to let her go.

757
00:41:22,229 --> 00:41:27,108
Most of Jason's injuries were to
the back and side of his head.

758
00:41:27,109 --> 00:41:29,235
How do you swing a baseball bat

759
00:41:29,236 --> 00:41:32,740
and hit somebody in the back of the head
if you're standing in front of them?

760
00:41:33,324 --> 00:41:36,159
It makes more sense that they
were either running from you

761
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:37,869
or you came up behind them.

There's defects in the walls
from weapons being swung.

The blood spatter
expert points out

770
00:42:07,233 --> 00:42:10,568
there are places that
appear to be consistent

771
00:42:10,569 --> 00:42:13,696
with Jason being
hit as he goes down.

773
00:42:16,408 --> 00:42:18,451
There's one place in particular

774
00:42:18,452 --> 00:42:22,581
where Jason was hit when his
head was inches from the floor.

775
00:42:23,666 --> 00:42:27,795
Clearly, Jason was still being
struck in the head after he was down.

[camera clicks]

777
00:42:30,422 --> 00:42:35,093
Also, he points out that there is
blood on the back of the bedroom door.

[camera clicking]

779
00:42:36,595 --> 00:42:41,891
That means there's a possibility there
was deadly violence going on in that room

780
00:42:41,892 --> 00:42:45,312
before Tom got there,
and the door was closed.

781
00:42:46,313 --> 00:42:48,691
Did Molly start something
that Tom got pulled into?

782
00:42:51,318 --> 00:42:53,529
Even if it started
as self-defense,

783
00:42:54,572 --> 00:42:58,074
at the point that Jason is no
longer aggressive toward them,

784
00:42:58,075 --> 00:43:00,159
they have to stop beating him,

785
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:01,536
and they didn't.

786
00:43:01,537 --> 00:43:03,205
And they beat him to death.

787
00:43:04,415 --> 00:43:05,623
[music fades]

788
00:43:05,624 --> 00:43:08,418
[Alan] As a result of
all that examination,

789
00:43:08,419 --> 00:43:12,213
we decide that it is appropriate
to charge second-degree murder.

790
00:43:12,214 --> 00:43:14,465
This isn't just excessive force.

791
00:43:14,466 --> 00:43:16,092
This is murder with malice.

[Jack] In the first few
months I was back in Ireland,

804
00:43:56,258 --> 00:43:58,218
I just felt I was
very out of place.

I didn't have a lot of
friends at the time,

808
00:44:05,267 --> 00:44:07,645
and I missed my friends
over in America.

We miss everyone in Meadowlands.

that we miss them.

even though we came
from the same situation.

She fit in a lot better. She
was a lot more chatty than me.

Okay, let me try that again.

821

She was able to find friends a lot
quicker than I would have been.

822
00:44:41,595 --> 00:44:44,847
And she kind of was
able to open up easier.

823
00:44:44,848 --> 00:44:48,059
So, you see her nails. They
haven't been painted, have they?

824
00:44:48,060 --> 00:44:49,394
[Tracey] Not for a while.

825
00:44:49,395 --> 00:44:52,481
No, they're not really
working out very well.

826
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:57,318
And I missed my life, I missed
all the sports that I did,

And then it was just
released to the press,

836

which was just a huge betrayal.

837
00:45:31,770 --> 00:45:34,439
And that was kind of when
my perspective changed,

838
00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:35,940

out what really happened

see what the truth really was.

So we set up a live
video-conference interview

846
00:46:01,216 --> 00:46:05,095
between our office
and Jack in Ireland.

847
00:46:06,054 --> 00:46:11,518
{\an8}Molly made me lie, uh, to the
people who were interviewing me.

848
00:46:12,978 --> 00:46:15,355
{\an8}[Ina] <i>And how did
Molly make you lie?</i>

849
00:46:16,565 --> 00:46:17,815
[Jack] Um...

850
00:46:17,816 --> 00:46:20,736
She made up a lot of
stories about my dad.

851
00:46:21,487 --> 00:46:22,653
Um, that he was...

852
00:46:22,654 --> 00:46:26,032
She said that he was very
abusive, and she wasn't lying.

853
00:46:26,033 --> 00:46:29,577
Then she started crying, and she
said, "I'd never see you again."

854
00:46:29,578 --> 00:46:31,120
I didn't know what was going on.

855
00:46:31,121 --> 00:46:33,206
[contemplative music playing]

856
00:46:33,207 --> 00:46:39,296
There has been this weight on my
shoulders for so long, of guilt.

857
00:46:39,963 --> 00:46:41,297
Molly told me,

858
00:46:41,298 --> 00:46:44,634
"You need to say that your dad hit
me, or they're gonna take you away."

859
00:46:44,635 --> 00:46:46,344
"And you're never
going to see me again."

860
00:46:46,345 --> 00:46:48,346
Tell me why you're here.

861
00:46:48,347 --> 00:46:54,186
My aunt and uncle from my dad's side
are trying to take me away from my mom.

862
00:46:56,396 --> 00:46:59,191
[Alan] The judge hears the
Dragonfly House recordings,

863
00:46:59,942 --> 00:47:03,695
he also is given the information
about Jack's recantation,

864
00:47:04,321 --> 00:47:08,366
and at this point, the
judge agreed with us

865
00:47:08,367 --> 00:47:11,577
that Jack and Sarah's statements
at the Dragonfly House

866
00:47:11,578 --> 00:47:13,788
are inadmissible hearsay,

867
00:47:13,789 --> 00:47:15,874
and now the jury
will not hear them.

868
00:47:19,086 --> 00:47:21,379
[Sarah] I said what
Molly told me to say.

869
00:47:21,380 --> 00:47:22,630
I had just lost my dad,

870
00:47:22,631 --> 00:47:25,259
I had already lost my mom, I
didn't want to lose anybody else,

871
00:47:25,843 --> 00:47:27,344
um, so I lied.

872
00:47:27,845 --> 00:47:32,348
I never saw my... my dad ever lay
hands on Molly, not once in my life.

873
00:47:32,349 --> 00:47:35,601
I was scared and afraid,
and I was so young,

874
00:47:35,602 --> 00:47:37,520
and I had no one
else in the world,

875
00:47:37,521 --> 00:47:39,481
and I was afraid
of losing Molly.

876
00:47:40,440 --> 00:47:41,774
I have so much guilt

877
00:47:41,775 --> 00:47:44,820
because, in a way, I felt
like I let my dad down.

878
00:47:45,696 --> 00:47:48,782
I described someone that was
the complete opposite of my dad.

[toy plane whirring]

880
00:47:52,744 --> 00:47:53,995
Boom!

881
00:47:53,996 --> 00:47:55,371
I want people to know the truth,

882
00:47:55,372 --> 00:47:57,957
and I want people to
know my dad as a person.

883
00:47:57,958 --> 00:48:00,626
Um, my dad was a
really amazing person,

884
00:48:00,627 --> 00:48:03,129
and what happened to him
shouldn't have happened to him.

885
00:48:03,130 --> 00:48:05,215
[pensive music playing]

886
00:48:05,883 --> 00:48:09,094
[Jack] My dad was killed the
way no person should be killed.

887
00:48:11,179 --> 00:48:15,684
He was beaten to death with a
cinder block and a baseball bat,

888
00:48:16,393 --> 00:48:21,857
and no... no person should ever have to
go through that... that sort of pain.

889
00:48:22,357 --> 00:48:23,900
And, like, in the evidence,

890
00:48:23,901 --> 00:48:26,235
you see that he tries
to get away from them,

891
00:48:26,236 --> 00:48:28,112
and they keep hitting him.

892
00:48:28,113 --> 00:48:29,531
They... They won't stop.

893
00:48:30,073 --> 00:48:33,118
And it's just really hard
to... to even think about.

894
00:48:39,124 --> 00:48:42,836
[Tracey] I'm trying to
establish why Jason was killed.

895
00:48:44,504 --> 00:48:47,173
There's a lot of email exchanges
between Jason and Molly

896
00:48:47,174 --> 00:48:48,841
that are concerning.

[Tracey] There seems to be
red flags in the relationship.

900
00:49:19,748 --> 00:49:23,502
I'm also getting messages from
members of the Meadowlands community.

901
00:49:24,002 --> 00:49:26,713
This one in particular
came on Facebook Messenger.

902
00:49:27,923 --> 00:49:31,509
It says, "Jason and Molly were at a
party the Friday before his death,

903
00:49:31,510 --> 00:49:34,470
and she was belittling
him, calling him a fat ass,

904
00:49:34,471 --> 00:49:37,264
saying that he must have taken
all the nutrition from his twin

905
00:49:37,265 --> 00:49:39,434
because he looked like
he had eaten for two."

906
00:49:41,311 --> 00:49:45,524
Jason actually left the party early
and seemed down, not like himself.

907
00:49:47,818 --> 00:49:51,445
He had spoken to me about
coming back to Ireland

908
00:49:51,446 --> 00:49:55,075
because the marriage
wasn't in a good place.

909
00:49:56,034 --> 00:49:58,619
And he had sent a
text to his friend.

Putting the pieces of

912
00:50:19,474 --> 00:50:22,977
I believe the relationship was
over, and he wanted to move home,

913
00:50:22,978 --> 00:50:25,480
and it was going to
happen really quickly.

914
00:50:27,524 --> 00:50:30,735
And Molly couldn't let Jason
leave with the children,

915
00:50:30,736 --> 00:50:33,321
because if she does,
she's lost everything.

00:55:57,729 --> 00:56:00,606
they repeat the
initial statements.

1012
00:56:00,607 --> 00:56:03,777
He just got very mad
about simple things.

1013
00:56:04,361 --> 00:56:06,488
It's gotten worse over
the past two months.

1014
00:56:07,989 --> 00:56:12,077
Now he's been cussing and screaming
a lot more, getting a lot angrier.

1015
00:56:13,578 --> 00:56:15,245
[Doug] Unbeknownst to anybody,

1016
00:56:15,246 --> 00:56:17,999
two weeks earlier, Jason
has gone to his doctor,

1017
00:56:18,750 --> 00:56:22,754
and he complained that he
found himself getting angry

1018
00:56:23,588 --> 00:56:25,215
for no reason.

1019
00:56:26,049 --> 00:56:29,551
Almost Jack's identical words.

1020
00:56:29,552 --> 00:56:33,932
So, now I'm thinking, "Wow,
maybe there's something to this."

1021
00:56:34,599 --> 00:56:37,059
[Jack] I just came
up with a keyword.

1022
00:56:37,060 --> 00:56:38,227
Tell me about that.

1023
00:56:38,228 --> 00:56:41,398
Um, "galaxy," that's mine,
and my sister's is "peacock."

1024
00:56:42,607 --> 00:56:45,110
And who told you to
set up these keywords?

1025
00:56:45,777 --> 00:56:46,777
My grandma.

1026
00:56:47,237 --> 00:56:49,822
I could just say, "peacock,"
and then I hang up the phone,

1027
00:56:49,823 --> 00:56:51,408
and she would come
over to our house.

1028
00:56:52,075 --> 00:56:53,784
- From Tennessee?
- Yeah.

1029
00:56:53,785 --> 00:56:55,869
Do you remember when
she came up with that?

1030
00:56:55,870 --> 00:57:00,542
A few weeks before my dad died,
the peacock thing happened.

1031
00:57:01,126 --> 00:57:03,919
[Brandy] What about their phone numbers?
Did you have those written down?

1032
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:06,381
[Jack] Yeah, we have
one under a doll.

1033
00:57:08,800 --> 00:57:11,260
[Jay] Their grandmother,
Sharon Martens, was concerned

1034
00:57:11,261 --> 00:57:14,054
'cause of things she knew about
what's going on in the house,

1035
00:57:14,055 --> 00:57:16,516
that she had the kids
create a code word

1036
00:57:17,142 --> 00:57:21,437
and gave the kids her phone
number and hid it from Jason

1037
00:57:21,438 --> 00:57:23,564
because they knew
how he would react.

1038
00:57:23,565 --> 00:57:26,316
Tell me about this cinder block
that you're talking about,

1039
00:57:26,317 --> 00:57:28,652
or the brick that your mom used.

1040
00:57:28,653 --> 00:57:32,614
[Jack] Um, we just got flowers
that we were going to plant

1041
00:57:32,615 --> 00:57:34,492
in our front yard or backyard.

1042
00:57:34,993 --> 00:57:37,954
And we were gonna paint
it so it looked pretty.

1043
00:57:38,788 --> 00:57:42,749
And it was in my mom's room
because it was raining earlier.

1044
00:57:42,750 --> 00:57:44,878
[Wanda] You have a
brick on the nightstand?

1045
00:57:45,587 --> 00:57:49,174
The kids and I
were gonna paint...

1046
00:57:50,758 --> 00:57:51,633
[sniffles]

1047
00:57:51,634 --> 00:57:56,305
Paint these bricks and
flowers around the mailbox.

1048
00:57:56,306 --> 00:57:57,598
It's not a coincidence

1049
00:57:57,599 --> 00:58:00,726
{\an8}that all the physical evidence
and the circumstantial evidence

1050
00:58:00,727 --> 00:58:06,523
{\an8}all corroborate what Tom and Molly told
law enforcement from the beginning.

1051
00:58:06,524 --> 00:58:10,069
I was stunned to
read that the state

1052
00:58:10,862 --> 00:58:14,741
had successfully persuaded
the trial judge to exclude

1053
00:58:15,408 --> 00:58:17,410
everything that the
children had said.

1054
00:58:19,245 --> 00:58:21,664
How could there have
been a fair trial

1055
00:58:22,248 --> 00:58:25,960
when the jury never heard the
very evidence that supports

1056
00:58:26,461 --> 00:58:28,421
what Molly said
happened that night?

1057
00:58:30,423 --> 00:58:32,841
One of the arguments
the state made

1058
00:58:32,842 --> 00:58:38,723
was that the children were now
recanting their original statements.

1059
00:58:39,682 --> 00:58:44,854
{\an8}And is it true that your
father was abusive, or false?

1060
00:58:45,939 --> 00:58:47,524
{\an8}[Jack] Um, false.

1061
00:58:48,483 --> 00:58:53,530
{\an8}I believe that this is just a
gross miscarriage of justice.

1062
00:58:54,113 --> 00:58:58,576
When I watched the interview of
Jack, it looks very rehearsed.

1063
00:58:59,327 --> 00:59:01,120
They appear to be brainwashed.

1064
00:59:02,539 --> 00:59:03,540
I know the truth.

1065
00:59:04,415 --> 00:59:06,751
I know that what they
state is not the truth.

1066
00:59:08,545 --> 00:59:10,587
What's going on
inside their heads?

1067
00:59:10,588 --> 00:59:11,881
I don't know.

1068
00:59:13,174 --> 00:59:16,760
[Mike] One is conducted by
a trained child interviewer

1069
00:59:16,761 --> 00:59:18,471
in a sterile environment.

1070
00:59:19,055 --> 00:59:20,097
One is not.

1071
00:59:20,098 --> 00:59:23,433
She told us that that's how my
dad died, and to tell the DA...

1072
00:59:23,434 --> 00:59:24,851
Uh, you're gone.

1073
00:59:24,852 --> 00:59:26,436
[Ina exclaims]

1074
00:59:26,437 --> 00:59:28,313
<i>It's okay. Are
you... Are you back?</i>

1075
00:59:28,314 --> 00:59:31,108
[Dr. Hayes] <i>I'm going
to have to call David.</i>

1076
00:59:31,109 --> 00:59:33,860
If this is such an
important interview,

1077
00:59:33,861 --> 00:59:38,031
uh, why can't Davidson County
fly somebody to Ireland

1078
00:59:38,032 --> 00:59:40,158
and conduct a proper interview?

1079
00:59:40,159 --> 00:59:41,827
- Hi.
- [man] Okay. Is that better?

1080
00:59:41,828 --> 00:59:44,205
[David] I'm gonna go ahead and
back out. You guys carry on.

1081
00:59:45,206 --> 00:59:47,875
Molly Corbett is sitting
in the women's prison

1082
00:59:49,460 --> 00:59:52,045
with a sentence
of 20 to 25 years.

1083
00:59:52,046 --> 00:59:54,132
[pensive music playing]

1084
00:59:56,009 --> 00:59:57,802
And I don't think she did this.

1085
00:59:58,636 --> 01:00:00,305
[music fades]

1086
01:00:02,390 --> 01:00:06,227
[bailiff announcing
start of session]

1087
01:00:11,441 --> 01:00:12,816
Good morning, everyone,

1088
01:00:12,817 --> 01:00:15,778
and welcome to the North
Carolina Court of Appeals.

1089
01:00:16,362 --> 01:00:20,198
I've got to convince these three
judges that an injustice was done.

1090
01:00:20,199 --> 01:00:22,826
Your Honor, I wanted
to address the decision

1091
01:00:22,827 --> 01:00:25,288
to exclude the
children's statements.

1092
01:00:25,872 --> 01:00:30,335
The trial court in its conclusions, in
my judgment, were clearly erroneous.

1093
01:00:31,711 --> 01:00:35,048
I got the decision from the
Court of Appeals that we had won.

1094
01:00:36,424 --> 01:00:41,137
And the judge ruled that Jason
Corbett was the aggressor that night.

1095
01:00:43,139 --> 01:00:45,432
But the state is
appealing the decision

1096
01:00:45,433 --> 01:00:47,684
to the full Supreme
Court of North Carolina.

1097
01:00:47,685 --> 01:00:49,936
And so, I begin again.

1098
01:00:49,937 --> 01:00:52,898
The children were uniquely
positioned to know the truth

1099
01:00:52,899 --> 01:00:56,443
of whether their father had
an irrational anger problem.

1100
01:00:56,444 --> 01:01:00,572
And therein lies the problem with
excluding the children's statements.

1101
01:01:00,573 --> 01:01:03,116
The Supreme Court of North
Carolina is in recess.

1102
01:01:03,117 --> 01:01:04,993
God save the state and
this honorable court.

1103
01:01:04,994 --> 01:01:06,079
[gavel bangs]

1104
01:01:10,625 --> 01:01:12,919
The Supreme Court has
ruled, and we won.

1105
01:01:14,545 --> 01:01:16,463
They have awarded a new trial.

1106
01:01:16,464 --> 01:01:21,010
And this time, the children's statements
are going to be heard by the jury.

1107
01:01:22,011 --> 01:01:25,180
The murder convictions of Molly
Corbett and Thomas Martens

1108
01:01:25,181 --> 01:01:27,391
have been overturned on appeal.

1109
01:01:27,392 --> 01:01:31,186
[reporter] <i>North Carolina Supreme Court
upheld an appellate court's ruling,</i>

1110
01:01:31,187 --> 01:01:33,773
<i>granting Tom and
Molly a new trial.</i>

1111
01:01:34,524 --> 01:01:37,192
There had been serious
problems with the trial,

1112
01:01:37,193 --> 01:01:40,278
and it was going
to be rectified.

1113
01:01:40,279 --> 01:01:43,074
It was exhilarating.
I was going home.

1114
01:01:43,658 --> 01:01:44,867
[tense music playing]

1115
01:01:45,451 --> 01:01:48,704
[reporter 1] <i>Well, tonight, Molly
Corbett and her father, Tom Martens,</i>

1116
01:01:48,705 --> 01:01:50,706
<i>are free on bail.</i>

1117
01:01:50,707 --> 01:01:52,791
[reporter 2] Mr. Martens,
how does it feel to be out?

1118
01:01:52,792 --> 01:01:54,876
[Tom] I'm glad to be
back with my family.

1119
01:01:54,877 --> 01:01:57,671
[reporter 3] <i>The father-daughter
pair left the Davidson County Jail</i>

1120
01:01:57,672 --> 01:01:59,632
<i>just an hour apart.</i>

1121
01:02:01,217 --> 01:02:05,304
{\an8}[Doug] For the first time in
over three and a half years,

1122
01:02:06,347 --> 01:02:10,059
{\an8}Molly walked out
of that jail free.

1123
01:02:13,020 --> 01:02:14,397
It's not fair...

1124
01:02:15,022 --> 01:02:16,064
[inhales deeply]

1125
01:02:16,065 --> 01:02:19,986
...that they're out and walking.

1126
01:02:22,155 --> 01:02:23,196
[sniffles]

1127
01:02:23,197 --> 01:02:24,991
I can't focus.

1128
01:02:28,911 --> 01:02:32,248
[sobbing] And there's
no trial date set.

1129
01:02:35,209 --> 01:02:36,209
There's no...

1130
01:02:39,630 --> 01:02:41,339
[sniffling]

1131
01:02:41,340 --> 01:02:46,345
There's nothing to say, "Okay,
this is when it's gonna be over."

1132
01:02:47,013 --> 01:02:48,639
I just have to sit here

1133
01:02:50,475 --> 01:02:54,437
and let my life pass me
by again because of them.

1134
01:02:56,689 --> 01:02:59,775
[Jack] Very hard to see the
people that took so much from you

1135
01:02:59,776 --> 01:03:01,360
and took your dad's life,

1136
01:03:02,320 --> 01:03:06,449
that are able to walk free and be
able to hug their dads and their moms

1137
01:03:08,075 --> 01:03:12,288
when we have to go down to a little patch
of grass with a headstone to see my dad.

1138
01:03:15,208 --> 01:03:19,045
[Doug] Now we have to prepare for
a new trial in front of a new jury.

1139
01:03:19,962 --> 01:03:23,966
All of the evidence is gonna be presented,
and the whole story will finally get told.

1140
01:03:24,967 --> 01:03:29,137
Domestic abuse was going
to come into the light.

1141
01:03:29,138 --> 01:03:30,597
I mean, my domestic abuse,

1142
01:03:30,598 --> 01:03:35,185
the abuse that I suffered and endured,
it was... it was going to come out.

1143
01:03:35,186 --> 01:03:37,271
[birds chirping]

1144
01:03:39,482 --> 01:03:42,652
I think we appeared as
a pretty perfect family,

1145
01:03:43,986 --> 01:03:50,158
but things were not great in
regard to Jason's treatment of me.

1146
01:03:50,159 --> 01:03:51,868
[somber music playing]

1147
01:03:51,869 --> 01:03:55,080
Just every day, there would
be kind of an interrogation

1148
01:03:55,081 --> 01:03:58,708
of what I did that day, who I
talked to, and what I was wearing.

1149
01:03:58,709 --> 01:04:02,337
And if I wore my hair a
different way, there would be,

1150
01:04:02,338 --> 01:04:04,172
"Why did you wear
your hair that way?"

1151
01:04:04,173 --> 01:04:06,092
"Were you hoping to talk
to someone specific?"

1152
01:04:07,510 --> 01:04:10,012
Everything was just
fraught with peril.

1153
01:04:11,430 --> 01:04:15,308
Sometimes he would just be
kind of seething and angry

1154
01:04:15,309 --> 01:04:18,144
because I hadn't
abided by something

1155
01:04:18,145 --> 01:04:20,439
or I'd been somewhere
I shouldn't have been.

1156
01:04:22,483 --> 01:04:24,652
And sometimes that
would lead, uh,

1157
01:04:25,862 --> 01:04:27,487
to a violent situation.

1158
01:04:27,488 --> 01:04:30,199
[camera clicks]

1159
01:04:32,493 --> 01:04:36,831
Molly was becoming a shell
of what she had been.

1160
01:04:38,207 --> 01:04:41,751
She was definitely not as happy.

1161
01:04:41,752 --> 01:04:44,338
She was definitely
not as confident.

1162
01:04:45,172 --> 01:04:47,675
She was acting beaten down.

1163
01:04:48,885 --> 01:04:52,972
I did not realize the extent or the
seriousness of the domestic abuse

1164
01:04:53,514 --> 01:04:54,890
that I do now.

1165
01:04:54,891 --> 01:04:57,767
Not letting me adopt the
children was a method of control.

1166
01:04:57,768 --> 01:05:00,395
And it was something that I
didn't recognize early on.

1167
01:05:00,396 --> 01:05:04,734
He would always say, "Why does it
matter? It's just a piece of paper."

1168
01:05:06,611 --> 01:05:10,280
He knew that a
divorce and custody

1169
01:05:10,281 --> 01:05:14,367
was just in the realm of
possibility if I adopted the kids.

1170
01:05:14,368 --> 01:05:17,914
And so, he wanted to make
sure that didn't happen.

1171
01:05:20,207 --> 01:05:22,751
If I had left at that time,

1172
01:05:22,752 --> 01:05:25,128
the kids were not old enough
to have a say in court

1173
01:05:25,129 --> 01:05:29,008
and I would most
likely lose the kids.

1174
01:05:29,550 --> 01:05:32,677
And I... I wasn't willing to
lose the kids, and he knew that.

1175
01:05:32,678 --> 01:05:34,889
He knew I couldn't
ever leave the kids.

1176
01:05:37,975 --> 01:05:42,562
And so, my friend in the neighborhood
who was the family attorney,

1177
01:05:42,563 --> 01:05:48,401
she recommended that I keep a
record of not only the abuse

1178
01:05:48,402 --> 01:05:51,529
but also just
general motherhood.

1179
01:05:51,530 --> 01:05:56,160
You know, so if there was a
divorce when the kids were older,

1180
01:05:56,702 --> 01:06:00,664
that there would be a
record that I was their mom.

1181
01:06:00,665 --> 01:06:04,585
And she recommended
that I make recordings.

1182
01:06:07,338 --> 01:06:09,547
[Jason] <i>I was trying to have
a conversation with Jack.</i>

1183
01:06:09,548 --> 01:06:12,425
<i>Could you just give me two
minutes to talk to my kids</i>

1184
01:06:12,426 --> 01:06:14,136
<i>when you're with
them all the time?</i>

1185
01:06:15,179 --> 01:06:16,888
<i>- Could you do that?</i>
- [Molly] <i>Yeah, I'm sorry.</i>

1186
01:06:16,889 --> 01:06:17,932
[Jason] <i>You should be.</i>

1187
01:06:19,183 --> 01:06:22,936
They were little recording
devices that were voice activated,

1188
01:06:22,937 --> 01:06:25,731
and I put them around the house.

1189
01:06:27,775 --> 01:06:29,485
Underneath the coffee table.

1190
01:06:30,486 --> 01:06:31,862
Underneath the counter.

1191
01:06:32,446 --> 01:06:34,782
One on the nightstand.

1192
01:06:36,409 --> 01:06:39,786
My plan had been to
control the situation

1193
01:06:39,787 --> 01:06:42,789
until they were old enough
to have a say in court.

1194
01:06:42,790 --> 01:06:45,167
And there were
times when I thought

1195
01:06:46,419 --> 01:06:48,879
that I'm gonna die
before that happens.

1196
01:06:50,464 --> 01:06:53,008
Um, but there was never a time

1197
01:06:53,009 --> 01:06:56,887
where I thought that Jason
might die before that happens.

1198
01:07:02,977 --> 01:07:05,186
{\an8}[Dr. Hampton] I get a
call from Doug Kingsbery

1199
01:07:05,187 --> 01:07:09,316
saying that he has a case that he
thinks I might be able to help with.

1200
01:07:10,234 --> 01:07:14,070
We have a man who is a very
successful businessman.

1201
01:07:14,071 --> 01:07:15,613
He gets along with everybody.

1202
01:07:15,614 --> 01:07:18,284
Does not have an angry
bone in his body.

1203
01:07:19,410 --> 01:07:22,370
The thing is, abusers can
appear one way n public

1204
01:07:22,371 --> 01:07:24,123
but very different in private.

1205
01:07:24,832 --> 01:07:30,712
And so, Doug sent me an audio recording
of the family during dinnertime.

1206
01:07:30,713 --> 01:07:34,299
[Jason] <i>Could I have dinner with the kids?
That's what I asked, but you ignored it</i>

1207
01:07:34,300 --> 01:07:35,675
<i>and went and fed them anyway.</i>

1208
01:07:35,676 --> 01:07:37,844
[Molly] <i>I was on the phone
with you ten minutes ago,</i>

1209
01:07:37,845 --> 01:07:40,889
<i>I said, "I'm gonna make some soup.
Do you want some?" And you said no.</i>

1210
01:07:40,890 --> 01:07:43,558
[Jason] <i>I said no because I
thought we'd have family dinner.</i>

1211
01:07:43,559 --> 01:07:45,435
<i>But you ignored it, honey,
because you just do,</i>

1212
01:07:45,436 --> 01:07:47,062
<i>because it's not what
you wanted to do.</i>

1213
01:07:47,063 --> 01:07:49,647
[Molly] <i>I said, "I'm
making soup for the kids."</i>

1214
01:07:49,648 --> 01:07:50,857
<i>"Do you want some?"</i>

1215
01:07:50,858 --> 01:07:53,443
[Jason] <i>The reason I said no is
because you ignored what I asked.</i>

1216
01:07:53,444 --> 01:07:54,819
[Molly] <i>I didn't
ignore anything.</i>

1217
01:07:54,820 --> 01:07:57,197
[Jason] <i>You forgot what I
asked. You couldn't care less.</i>

1218
01:07:57,198 --> 01:08:00,784
One of the characteristics of abusers
is they like to take on the victim role.

1219
01:08:00,785 --> 01:08:04,120
And no matter how much Molly tries
to appease him or reassure him

1220
01:08:04,121 --> 01:08:06,498
that she was offering
to do something for him,

1221
01:08:06,499 --> 01:08:07,791
he does not want to be pleased.

1222
01:08:07,792 --> 01:08:09,918
He doesn't want a
solution to the problem.

1223
01:08:09,919 --> 01:08:11,795
He wants a problem
to complain about.

1224
01:08:11,796 --> 01:08:14,464
[Jason] <i>I said, "I'd like to
have dinner with my family."</i>

1225
01:08:14,465 --> 01:08:16,341
<i>That's what I said to
you. You decided...</i>

1226
01:08:16,342 --> 01:08:18,843
[Molly] <i>Jack, stop hanging off
the banister. Go to your room.</i>

1227
01:08:18,844 --> 01:08:21,513
[Jason] <i>No, don't go up to your
room, Jack, come down here, please.</i>

1228
01:08:21,514 --> 01:08:23,598
<i>Don't tell them to go
when I'm talking to them.</i>

1229
01:08:23,599 --> 01:08:26,476
- [Sarah] <i>I gotta go to the bathroom.</i>
- [Jason] <i>You can stay there, please.</i>

1230
01:08:26,477 --> 01:08:28,061
<i>Can you look at me?
Have some respect?</i>

1231
01:08:28,062 --> 01:08:31,106
<i>Asked you to have dinner with my family.
You said you were feeding the kids.</i>

1232
01:08:31,107 --> 01:08:34,317
<i>That's why I said no, because you ignored
what I said about dinner with my family.</i>

1233
01:08:34,318 --> 01:08:36,736
- [Molly] <i>Sit down, finish your food.</i>
<i>- Who cares what he says.</i>

1234
01:08:36,737 --> 01:08:39,239
<i>Don't send them out when I'm
talking. You don't have the right.</i>

1235
01:08:39,240 --> 01:08:41,033
"You don't have the right."

1236
01:08:41,700 --> 01:08:45,287
I mean, yeah, she's not...
she's not their adoptive mother.

1237
01:08:46,247 --> 01:08:49,791
According to Jason, this
is further ammunition

1238
01:08:49,792 --> 01:08:52,001
to letting Molly know
where she stands.

1239
01:08:52,002 --> 01:08:54,420
[Molly] <i>It's Pancake Tuesday.
Why don't I make some pancakes?</i>

1240
01:08:54,421 --> 01:08:57,340
[Jason] <i>I don't want anything from
you. I asked you over and over again.</i>

1241
01:08:57,341 --> 01:08:59,801
<i>You made it clear you want to
try to separate me from my kids.</i>

1242
01:08:59,802 --> 01:09:00,844
[Molly] <i>No, I don't, J.</i>

1243
01:09:00,845 --> 01:09:02,762
[Jason] <i>I'm gonna
do the same to you.</i>

1244
01:09:02,763 --> 01:09:04,931
<i>The difference is, I
will be able to do it.</i>

1245
01:09:04,932 --> 01:09:07,017
That's a very clear
threat from Jason.

1246
01:09:07,518 --> 01:09:10,771
"If you try to take the kids from me,
I'll just take the kids from you."

1247
01:09:11,605 --> 01:09:13,690
[Jason] <i>I shouldn't have
to say it over and over...</i>

1248
01:09:13,691 --> 01:09:15,900
[Molly] <i>Can you guys get
out the stuff for pancakes?</i>

1249
01:09:15,901 --> 01:09:17,735
- [Jason] <i>There you go again!</i>
- [chair slams]

1250
01:09:17,736 --> 01:09:20,113
<i>I'm talking to you, and you're
talking about something else!</i>

1251
01:09:20,114 --> 01:09:22,365
- [Jack] <i>Stop slamming your chair!</i>
- [Sarah] <i>Stop fighting!</i>

1252
01:09:22,366 --> 01:09:24,033
- [Jason] <i>Go up to bed.</i>
- [Sarah crying]

1253
01:09:24,034 --> 01:09:26,786
- [Jason] <i>Up to bed. Go.</i>
- [Molly] <i>She just got scared, J.</i>

1254
01:09:26,787 --> 01:09:29,038
- [Jason] <i>Up to bed.</i>
- [Jack] <i>She did, Dad. She got scared.</i>

1255
01:09:29,039 --> 01:09:30,999
[Jason] <i>Go to bed.
Go to bed. Go to bed.</i>

1256
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:33,085
[pensive music playing]

1257
01:09:34,420 --> 01:09:38,548
[Mike] If a jury hears this
evidence of domestic abuse,

1258
01:09:38,549 --> 01:09:40,885
they will find Tom
and Molly innocent.

1259
01:09:42,428 --> 01:09:46,181
Because Molly told a story five
years ago, or maybe two stories,

1260
01:09:46,182 --> 01:09:49,935
does that mean that she
was not abused by Jason?

1261
01:09:50,436 --> 01:09:52,353
My daughter's not a liar.

1262
01:09:52,354 --> 01:09:53,480
I'm not a liar.

1263
01:09:55,774 --> 01:09:58,194
And if you think
we are, go for it.

1264
01:09:59,111 --> 01:09:59,986
Prove it.

1265
01:09:59,987 --> 01:10:01,697
[music continues]

1266
01:10:03,532 --> 01:10:05,909
[Alan] We learn that there
are secret recordings

1267
01:10:05,910 --> 01:10:08,703
that Molly has made of Jason.

1268
01:10:08,704 --> 01:10:12,248
Molly was the only person who
knew the recording was being made,

1269
01:10:12,249 --> 01:10:15,628
which creates a scenario where
she can control the narrative.

1270
01:10:17,087 --> 01:10:23,259
{\an8}Molly was preparing for divorce
and custody proceedings.

1271
01:10:23,260 --> 01:10:25,596
[Jason] <i>I'll be able to do
what you're trying to do.</i>

1272
01:10:26,347 --> 01:10:28,933
- [Molly] <i>I'm not trying to do anything, J.</i>
- [Jason] <i>You are.</i>

1273
01:10:29,642 --> 01:10:31,560
She clearly is trying
to do something.

1274
01:10:32,228 --> 01:10:35,897
Anyone who's making secret
recordings in a personal relationship

1275
01:10:35,898 --> 01:10:40,569
can manipulate the context
and make Jason look bad.

1276
01:10:43,239 --> 01:10:45,240
[dog barking]

1277
01:10:45,241 --> 01:10:48,201
[Jack] In the last months
before my father was killed,

1278
01:10:48,202 --> 01:10:50,411
the mood was kinda
different in the house.

1279
01:10:50,412 --> 01:10:53,624
There wasn't as much activities
with us as a family going on.

1280
01:10:55,334 --> 01:10:57,752
When I kinda really
started to notice it was

1281
01:10:57,753 --> 01:11:01,507
when I found the recording device in
my dad's car, and I showed it to him.

1282
01:11:02,007 --> 01:11:05,218
And he was absolutely
shocked to see it in there.

1283
01:11:05,219 --> 01:11:08,806
And he said, "How do you feel
about moving back to Ireland?"

1284
01:11:09,306 --> 01:11:11,849
And Sarah said, "Without
Mommy?" And my dad said, "Yes."

1285
01:11:11,850 --> 01:11:13,644
And I knew Molly
would not like that.

1286
01:11:15,020 --> 01:11:18,607
She knew he'd be able to take us away,
and she'd be able to do nothing about it.

1287
01:11:19,984 --> 01:11:22,903
It appears from everything
we learned about Molly

1288
01:11:23,487 --> 01:11:27,907
that things are coming to a head
as it relates to the marriage

1289
01:11:27,908 --> 01:11:32,454
and to, most importantly, to
her custody of the children.

1290
01:11:34,373 --> 01:11:37,835
[Alan] We look back at Tom's
statement the night Jason was killed,

1291
01:11:38,669 --> 01:11:42,422
and the reason for the
visit from Tom and Sharon.

1292
01:11:42,423 --> 01:11:44,173
I mean, we're fairly
social people.

1293
01:11:44,174 --> 01:11:46,801
And we didn't really have
anything going on this weekend.

1294
01:11:46,802 --> 01:11:50,179
That Saturday morning, we decided, "Hey,
why don't we go on over to Molly's?"

1295
01:11:50,180 --> 01:11:53,057
It's a four-hour drive,
and it's a beautiful day.

1296
01:11:53,058 --> 01:11:55,977
[Alan] But we learned
from people in Tennessee,

1297
01:11:55,978 --> 01:11:58,146
where Tom and Sharon live,

1298
01:11:58,147 --> 01:12:02,734
that Tom and Sharon had plans
that night with his boss,

1299
01:12:02,735 --> 01:12:05,153
which they canceled
at the last minute.

1300
01:12:05,154 --> 01:12:07,239
[pensive music playing]

1301
01:12:08,240 --> 01:12:11,492
We do not believe that
Tom came to North Carolina

1302
01:12:11,493 --> 01:12:13,829
to beat Jason to death
with a baseball bat.

1303
01:12:14,330 --> 01:12:20,294
Our theory is that Molly had
devised some explosive event.

1304
01:12:21,628 --> 01:12:27,092
If Molly could get
Jason to blow up

1305
01:12:28,218 --> 01:12:30,846
while her parents were
there as witnesses,

1306
01:12:32,097 --> 01:12:35,308
she could apply for a domestic
violence protective order,

1307
01:12:35,309 --> 01:12:37,644
which would remove
him from the house.

1308
01:12:39,396 --> 01:12:43,192
And then she can file for
emergency custody of the children

1309
01:12:43,692 --> 01:12:46,195
and take his children
away from him.

1310
01:12:49,490 --> 01:12:52,951
But when the plan went
awry, and it got violent,

1311
01:12:53,869 --> 01:12:57,331
it appears she quit caring
whether or not he lived or died.

1312
01:13:00,834 --> 01:13:02,836
[melancholy music playing]

1313
01:13:11,178 --> 01:13:14,305
[reporter] <i>Now, everyone's talking
about Tom and Molly Martens.</i>

1314
01:13:14,306 --> 01:13:16,682
<i>This case has
caused a big divide</i>

1315
01:13:16,683 --> 01:13:19,018
<i>between the US and
Ireland for a long time.</i>

1316
01:13:19,019 --> 01:13:23,524
[reporter 2] <i>The situation now is that
they are expected to go for a retrial</i>

1317
01:13:24,191 --> 01:13:26,735
<i>on the same charges in 2022.</i>

1318
01:13:28,112 --> 01:13:30,571
[radio host] How difficult is
it to listen to all the things

1319
01:13:30,572 --> 01:13:33,408
that you know have been
said about your dead brother

1320
01:13:33,409 --> 01:13:35,410
to make him look as
if he deserved it?

1321
01:13:35,411 --> 01:13:37,954
I think that's one of the
reasons why I wrote the book,

1322
01:13:37,955 --> 01:13:42,626
because we weren't
able to defend Jason.

1323
01:13:44,169 --> 01:13:49,758
I've been fighting for justice
for Jason for seven years.

1324
01:13:51,510 --> 01:13:53,345
Now I face a retrial,

1325
01:13:53,846 --> 01:13:56,640
and I expect that the
defense will call me.

1326
01:13:57,141 --> 01:14:01,562
I believe they're going to try and
claim that I brainwashed Jack and Sarah,

1327
01:14:02,604 --> 01:14:05,315
which is utterly... untrue.

1328

[David] Telling a child what to
say, or telling a child to lie,

1329
01:14:11,155 --> 01:14:13,615
would go against every
fiber of my being.

1330
01:14:14,533 --> 01:14:16,033
That is never going to happen.

1331
01:14:16,034 --> 01:14:18,704
[seagulls squawking]

1332
01:14:21,457 --> 01:14:25,251
[Sarah] I'm just packing, getting ready,
'cause we're leaving in the morning

1333
01:14:25,252 --> 01:14:27,629
for the pre-trial hearing.

1334
01:14:28,130 --> 01:14:32,718
It will be the first time we
see the Martens since 2015.

1335
01:14:33,510 --> 01:14:36,430
So, that's going
to be very hard.

1336
01:14:37,764 --> 01:14:39,765
[Jack] The reason they
were granted a retrial

1337
01:14:39,766 --> 01:14:42,101
is a lot to do with my
Dragonfly interview,

1338
01:14:42,102 --> 01:14:44,396
where I said that
my dad hit Molly.

1339
01:14:45,189 --> 01:14:47,274
It's always in the
back of my mind.

1340
01:14:49,234 --> 01:14:51,694
We all just hope that the retrial
is set as soon as possible.

1341
01:14:51,695 --> 01:14:53,905
These people have been
out for over a year,

1342
01:14:53,906 --> 01:14:58,784
and that I think it's time
for this book to be closed

1343
01:14:58,785 --> 01:15:00,954
and that justice to be served.

1344
01:15:02,039 --> 01:15:04,916
I just want to be there to
support my father and my family.

1345

1350
01:15:32,694 --> 01:15:36,490
[Sarah] They walked into the courtroom
and I saw Molly, and I saw Tom.

1351
01:15:37,533 --> 01:15:39,573
They had their heads down.
They wouldn't look at me.

1352
01:15:41,411 --> 01:15:43,830
{\an8}And I thought, "I'm
not afraid anymore."

1353
01:15:45,207 --> 01:15:47,124
I'm not the one who
should be afraid.

1354
01:15:47,125 --> 01:15:49,001
I... I did nothing wrong.

1355
01:15:49,002 --> 01:15:50,836
I lied, that's true.

1356
01:15:50,837 --> 01:15:52,380
Um...

1357
01:15:52,381 --> 01:15:53,382
But I was eight.

1358
01:15:53,966 --> 01:15:58,428

will be delivered for my dad.

It's stressful having to deal
with this hanging over us.

But if I get to testify,
which I hope I do,

1368
01:16:28,417 --> 01:16:32,837
I feel confident I'll be able to portray
what really happened inside the house,

1369
01:16:32,838 --> 01:16:36,924
and tell people and the jury
what Molly was really like,

and the real version
of events, the truth.

1371
01:16:39,386 --> 01:16:42,138
I've been waiting a long
time to say everything,

1372
01:16:42,139 --> 01:16:47,435

explain what happened to me,

[contemplative music playing]

1375
01:16:54,776 --> 01:16:56,068
On the outside of the house,

1376
01:16:56,069 --> 01:16:58,864
the house looks like
sunshines and rainbows.

1377
01:17:00,699 --> 01:17:04,077
And on the inside,
it's dark and heavy.

1378
01:17:07,831 --> 01:17:10,333
[Jack] My relationship with
Molly got progressively worse

1379
01:17:10,334 --> 01:17:12,294
as we moved over to America.

1380
01:17:14,254 --> 01:17:18,467
Myself and Sarah used to have pictures
of our biological mother in our rooms,

1381
01:17:18,967 --> 01:17:21,637
and she took the picture
off me and hid it.

1382
01:17:23,388 --> 01:17:27,933
I feel that Molly wanted to be
the only mother that existed,

1383
01:17:27,934 --> 01:17:29,936
that there was no
one else before her.

1384
01:17:30,771 --> 01:17:34,775
Sarah had a lot closer
relationship with Molly than I did.

1385
01:17:35,901 --> 01:17:37,653
They did everything together.

1386
01:17:38,403 --> 01:17:40,906
She was like the...
the star child.

1387
01:17:42,491 --> 01:17:44,117
I was closer with my dad.

1388
01:17:46,286 --> 01:17:49,413
I remember when my father
was on a work trip,

1389
01:17:49,414 --> 01:17:51,500
and I said, "Goodbye,
I love you."

1390
01:17:52,125 --> 01:17:54,210
She chased me up to my room,

1391
01:17:54,211 --> 01:17:58,422
she destroyed my whole room, pulled
all my clothes out, flipped my bed,

1392
01:17:58,423 --> 01:17:59,883
turned over my dresser.

1393
01:18:02,094 --> 01:18:03,928
[somber music playing]

1394
01:18:03,929 --> 01:18:07,264
I was in the car with
Molly, and I asked her,

1395
01:18:07,265 --> 01:18:11,519
"Could I start tee-ball? Dad's
the coach, so he can bring me."

1396
01:18:11,520 --> 01:18:13,938
And Molly turned around and
said, "Do you not love me?"

1397
01:18:13,939 --> 01:18:17,024
"Do you not care about me? You
don't want to spend time with me."

1398
01:18:17,025 --> 01:18:19,236
"Why do you want to spend
time with your dad?"

1399
01:18:19,820 --> 01:18:23,406
I felt awful because I
thought I really hurt her.

1400
01:18:23,407 --> 01:18:25,950
I couldn't even tell my
dad things that happened,

1401
01:18:25,951 --> 01:18:29,704
and that made it really hard for me to
know what was right and what was wrong,

1402
01:18:29,705 --> 01:18:33,500
because I only had one person
whispering in my ear the whole time.

1403
01:18:36,920 --> 01:18:39,922
[Jack] I was constantly
fighting to be loved by her.

1404
01:18:39,923 --> 01:18:40,923
[inhales deeply]

1405
01:18:40,924 --> 01:18:45,010
I did everything I could to
just feel attention off her,

1406
01:18:45,011 --> 01:18:46,303
not even love,

1407
01:18:46,304 --> 01:18:47,304
and I loved her.

1408
01:18:49,391 --> 01:18:51,184
[Sarah] Me and Jack
both loved her.

1409
01:18:52,144 --> 01:18:56,021
But I think that she pitted
me and Jack against each other

1410
01:18:56,022 --> 01:18:57,441
to fight for her love.

1411
01:18:58,233 --> 01:19:00,568
I think if it had
gotten to a case

1412
01:19:00,569 --> 01:19:03,195
where we had been brought
before a judge at 13,

1413
01:19:03,196 --> 01:19:06,158
I would have chose my dad
every day of the week.

1414
01:19:07,242 --> 01:19:09,578
But Sarah would
have picked Molly.

1415
01:19:11,747 --> 01:19:14,374
Molly took Sarah away
from my dad constantly.

1416
01:19:15,459 --> 01:19:16,460
She never got...

1417
01:19:28,430 --> 01:19:31,183
She never got the relationship
that she wanted with him.

1418
01:19:31,767 --> 01:19:32,850
That's Molly's fault.

1419
01:19:32,851 --> 01:19:34,811
In my opinion,
that's Molly's fault.

1420
01:19:39,483 --> 01:19:41,401
[pensive music playing]

1421
01:19:45,947 --> 01:19:49,534
[Doug] As we are
preparing for a retrial,

1422
01:19:50,076 --> 01:19:54,997
I find out that Molly has
a handful of close friends

1423
01:19:54,998 --> 01:19:59,961
{\an8}that heard Jason
in fits of anger,

1424
01:20:00,962 --> 01:20:02,296
{\an8}threaten her,

1425
01:20:02,297 --> 01:20:05,424
or who witnessed Jason's
controlling behavior,

1426
01:20:05,425 --> 01:20:08,261
supporting what Molly
has described to me.

1427
01:20:09,262 --> 01:20:11,139
One of the women says,

1428
01:20:11,640 --> 01:20:15,936
"Molly has told me Jason has
strangled me before in the bedroom."

1429
01:20:17,687 --> 01:20:18,939
And she said,

1430
01:20:19,815 --> 01:20:26,321
"Molly was afraid that Jason
had strangled his first wife,

1431
01:20:26,905 --> 01:20:30,616
and she was growing concerned
that it could happen to her."

1432
01:20:30,617 --> 01:20:32,953
And I'm... I'm thinking, "What?"

1433
01:20:34,204 --> 01:20:35,580
It's been there all along,

1434
01:20:36,706 --> 01:20:38,582
since the first interview
with law enforcement.

1435
01:20:38,583 --> 01:20:42,838
His first wife died in
mysterious circumstances.

1436
01:20:43,630 --> 01:20:48,134
Um, the finding was that
she had an asthma attack.

1437
01:20:48,635 --> 01:20:49,885
This didn't just come up.

1438
01:20:49,886 --> 01:20:53,180
Tom had concerns from when he
talked to Mikey Fitzpatrick.

1439
01:20:53,181 --> 01:20:55,267
[tense music playing]

1440
01:20:57,727 --> 01:21:00,479
[Tom] <i>We had the maternal

01:21:07,863 --> 01:21:09,865
<i>His name is Mikey Fitzpatrick.</i>

01:21:10,365 --> 01:21:14,369
<i>He's not a well-educated man.
He's very hard to understand.</i>

<i>Got a heavy Irish accent.</i>

1447
01:21:17,289 --> 01:21:19,249
<i>I asked him what he
thought of Jason.</i>

1448
01:21:19,916 --> 01:21:23,044
<i>He said, "I think he
killed my daughter."</i>

1449

1450
01:21:25,547 --> 01:21:28,507
<i>I didn't know if it
was just a bitter man</i>

1451

<i>who... needed somebody to
blame for his daughter's death,</i>

1452
01:21:34,264 --> 01:21:37,225
<i>or if he had a basis for this.</i>

1453
01:21:38,435 --> 01:21:39,853
He was deadly serious.

1454
01:21:41,229 --> 01:21:43,063
He wasn't joking around.

1455
01:21:43,064 --> 01:21:47,860
{\an8}Nobody investigated any
further into Mags' death

1456
01:21:47,861 --> 01:21:50,529
{\an8}and the circumstances
surrounding Mags' death.

1457
01:21:50,530 --> 01:21:53,658
Everybody accepted
the autopsy findings

1458
01:21:54,284 --> 01:21:56,912
until Doug started
digging further.

1459
01:21:58,288 --> 01:22:01,875
I obtained a copy of the
official autopsy report

1460
01:22:02,876 --> 01:22:04,878
of Jason's first wife.

1461
01:22:13,637 --> 01:22:15,847
I have a medical
expert look at this.

1462
01:22:16,348 --> 01:22:19,935
He says, "Jason Corbett's first wife
did not die from an asthma attack."

1463
01:22:21,102 --> 01:22:23,312
"The evidence to me shows

1464
01:22:23,313 --> 01:22:26,775
that she succumbed to injuries
from manual strangulation."

1465
01:22:28,777 --> 01:22:33,531
We had learned that Mags'
sister was there that night.

1466
01:22:35,533 --> 01:22:40,956
And she reported, "Mags kept saying,
'I'm going to die. I'm going to die.'"

1467
01:22:43,375 --> 01:22:46,835
That's what happens to victims
of manual strangulation

1468
01:22:46,836 --> 01:22:48,630
that survive the event

1469
01:22:49,464 --> 01:22:51,800
but dies from those
injuries within the hour.

1470
01:22:54,636 --> 01:22:58,682
But according to Mags
Corbett's autopsy report,

1471
01:22:59,265 --> 01:23:02,519
there were not visible marks
on the outside of her neck.

1472
01:23:05,563 --> 01:23:10,025
My expert says, "You don't die from
what's on the external part of the neck."

1473
01:23:10,026 --> 01:23:12,403
"You die from the injury
that can't be seen

1474
01:23:12,404 --> 01:23:13,947
on the inside of the neck."

1475
01:23:14,447 --> 01:23:15,573
This is important.

1476
01:23:16,783 --> 01:23:20,077
The state is making an argument

1477
01:23:20,078 --> 01:23:22,538
that Molly couldn't have
been strangled that night

1478
01:23:22,539 --> 01:23:26,001
because there's a lack
of injuries to her neck.

1479
01:23:26,710 --> 01:23:32,172
And he says to me, "Take a look
at the photograph of Molly Corbett

1480
01:23:32,173 --> 01:23:36,803
taken in the early morning hours right
outside the house by the police."

1481
01:23:38,847 --> 01:23:40,973
"Do you see that linear mark

1482
01:23:40,974 --> 01:23:43,935
on the left side of Molly's
neck below her ear?"

1483
01:23:44,436 --> 01:23:46,271
I hadn't noticed it before.

1484
01:23:46,813 --> 01:23:48,606
He says, "That's a nail dig."

1485
01:23:49,733 --> 01:23:52,569
It's what happens during
manual strangulation

1486
01:23:53,111 --> 01:23:56,614
when either the
assailant's nails

1487
01:23:57,198 --> 01:23:59,117
dig into the side of the neck,

1488
01:23:59,826 --> 01:24:04,122
or sometimes the victim is
trying to pry the hand away.

1489
01:24:05,331 --> 01:24:07,417
[camera clicking]

1490
01:24:09,002 --> 01:24:10,335
And he says to me,

1491
01:24:10,336 --> 01:24:14,174
"Have you examined her pajamas
that she was wearing that night?"

1492
01:24:14,674 --> 01:24:16,801
"No. What am I looking for?"

1493
01:24:19,220 --> 01:24:22,307
"If the victim
loses consciousness,

1494
01:24:23,308 --> 01:24:25,810
uh, they lose control
of their bladder."

1495
01:24:26,436 --> 01:24:28,729
"I'll bet you dollars to donuts,

1496
01:24:28,730 --> 01:24:31,565
you're gonna go down there
and find a urine stain

1497
01:24:31,566 --> 01:24:33,777
in the crotch area
of her pajamas."

1498
01:24:36,613 --> 01:24:37,614
And there it is.

1499
01:24:39,741 --> 01:24:46,288
I believe the only reason wife
number two was not victim number two

1500
01:24:46,289 --> 01:24:49,249
was because that night
her 65-year-old father

1501
01:24:49,250 --> 01:24:51,961
was there to
intervene and stop it.

1502
01:24:52,545 --> 01:24:54,089
[music fades]

1503
01:24:54,964 --> 01:24:59,469
[Alan] There are numerous expert witnesses
for the state and for the defense.

1504
01:25:00,303 --> 01:25:03,431
Every expert who looks
at the autopsy of Mags

1505
01:25:04,057 --> 01:25:07,226
agree that she did not
die of an asthma attack.

1506
01:25:07,227 --> 01:25:08,560
[pensive music playing]

1507
01:25:08,561 --> 01:25:13,065
But our experts said that you
could not extrapolate from that

1508
01:25:13,066 --> 01:25:15,819
that Jason or anybody
else had killed her.

1509
01:25:16,402 --> 01:25:20,365
That is a reckless conclusion and
is not supported by the evidence.

1510
01:25:21,741 --> 01:25:25,536
There is a long list of
possible health conditions

1511
01:25:25,537 --> 01:25:29,374
which would have looked like an
asthma attack in a known asthmatic.

1512
01:25:31,209 --> 01:25:34,796
However, the claims that
Jason must have strangled her

1513
01:25:35,296 --> 01:25:38,257
is not the kind of testimony we
want to get in front of a jury.

1514
01:25:38,258 --> 01:25:41,386
We're concerned that a jury hears
that, they may stop listening.

1515
01:25:43,388 --> 01:25:46,265
{\an8}Jack and Sarah are
absolutely convinced

1516
01:25:46,266 --> 01:25:49,853
{\an8}that their testimony
will fix everything.

1517
01:25:50,770 --> 01:25:53,356
{\an8}But even if they
testify brilliantly

1518
01:25:54,107 --> 01:25:56,108
and carry their
share of the load,

1519
01:25:56,109 --> 01:25:57,485
and more,

1520
01:25:58,862 --> 01:26:00,530
it could still go sideways.

1521
01:26:02,782 --> 01:26:07,411
And so, we are willing to
consider plea negotiations.

1522
01:26:07,412 --> 01:26:09,497
[music continues]

1523
01:26:16,671 --> 01:26:18,006
[music fades]

1524
01:26:18,590 --> 01:26:20,591
[newsreader] Today, Molly
Corbett and Thomas Martens

1525
01:26:20,592 --> 01:26:22,551
appeared in a Davidson
County courtroom

1526
01:26:22,552 --> 01:26:25,888
to plead for a reduced charge
of voluntary manslaughter.

1527
01:26:25,889 --> 01:26:30,184
{\an8}Molly Corbett, she pled no contest to
that charge of voluntary manslaughter.

1528
01:26:30,185 --> 01:26:34,354
{\an8}And Thomas Martens, he pled guilty to
the charge of voluntary manslaughter.

1529
01:26:34,355 --> 01:26:38,400
{\an8}Now, they also say his exemplary
career in the FBI in upholding the law

1530
01:26:38,401 --> 01:26:40,528
{\an8}should warrant an
easier sentence.

1531
01:26:41,988 --> 01:26:44,531
I had no interest
in taking a plea.

1532
01:26:44,532 --> 01:26:46,408
I was ready to go to trial.

1533
01:26:46,409 --> 01:26:49,913
I was ready for the truth to prevail,
and I was ready to fight back.

1534
01:26:51,497 --> 01:26:54,875
But the possibility
of us losing at trial

1535
01:26:54,876 --> 01:26:59,588
and my father being incarcerated for
what would be the rest of his life,

1536
01:26:59,589 --> 01:27:02,133
I couldn't handle
that responsibility.

1537
01:27:03,051 --> 01:27:05,510
[Madison] The state and defense
teams, they're gonna go through

1538
01:27:05,511 --> 01:27:08,931
{\an8}all of the evidence from a case
that this area knows very well

1539
01:27:08,932 --> 01:27:10,307
{\an8}and present that to a judge.

1540
01:27:10,308 --> 01:27:14,479
{\an8}And then he'll make the determination
of how long their sentences should be.

1541
01:27:15,813 --> 01:27:18,815
My whole world has just been
flipped upside down again

1542
01:27:18,816 --> 01:27:22,027
for I don't know how many times
over the last eight years.

1543
01:27:22,028 --> 01:27:27,074
They could walk out at the end of the
sentencing hearing for time served.

1544
01:27:27,075 --> 01:27:28,993
It's just a complete injustice.

1545
01:27:29,869 --> 01:27:33,538
This is not what my dad deserves.
This isn't what I deserve.

1546
01:27:33,539 --> 01:27:35,541
It's not right. It's not fair.

1547
01:27:36,960 --> 01:27:40,295
[newsreader] The court has been hearing
testimony from friends and neighbors

1548
01:27:40,296 --> 01:27:41,838
of Molly Martens Corbett

1549
01:27:41,839 --> 01:27:46,510
who said they were aware of arguments,
physical violence and controlling behavior

1550
01:27:46,511 --> 01:27:48,179
in the Corbetts' marriage.

1551
01:27:48,763 --> 01:27:52,224
[reporter] <i>Questions were raised about
the cause of death of his previous wife,</i>

1552
01:27:52,225 --> 01:27:53,475
<i>Margaret Corbett.</i>

1553
01:27:53,476 --> 01:27:56,186
The defense brought in
pathologists who say it's possible

1554
01:27:56,187 --> 01:27:57,772
that someone
could've killed her.

1555
01:27:58,982 --> 01:28:00,942
[Sarah] I feel like
my dad's on trial.

1556
01:28:01,442 --> 01:28:05,280
And I feel like all the focus
is on my dad's character.

1557
01:28:07,073 --> 01:28:11,493
Molly's lawyers say that
there's one common denominator

1558
01:28:11,494 --> 01:28:14,788
in my birth mother's
death and my dad's death.

1559
01:28:14,789 --> 01:28:16,790
My birth mother was feeding me

1560
01:28:16,791 --> 01:28:19,918
'cause I woke up crying the
night that she died. [sniffles]

1561
01:28:19,919 --> 01:28:24,090
And the night that my dad died,
I woke up and went downstairs.

1562
01:28:25,925 --> 01:28:31,221
How could you blame me for the
reason both of my parents are dead?

1563
01:28:31,222 --> 01:28:32,932
[melancholy music playing]

1564
01:28:37,020 --> 01:28:39,147
That's when I realized that

1565
01:28:40,732 --> 01:28:43,400
this is just a case
for the defense.

1566
01:28:43,401 --> 01:28:46,571
They don't know my da... my dad,
and they don't want to know him.

1567
01:28:47,530 --> 01:28:52,451
[Molly] As painful as that news
could have been for them to hear

1568
01:28:52,452 --> 01:28:55,370
that Mags didn't die
of an asthma attack,

1569
01:28:55,371 --> 01:28:59,083
which is the story that they
have been fed their entire lives,

1570
01:28:59,709 --> 01:29:04,254
um, I guess I did have some hope that
this would, you know, cause a break

1571
01:29:04,255 --> 01:29:07,174
in... in their brainwashing.

1572
01:29:07,175 --> 01:29:08,384
But, um...

1573
01:29:10,636 --> 01:29:13,013
they continue to
believe she did,

1574
01:29:13,014 --> 01:29:15,224
and maybe that's what
they have to believe.

1575
01:29:16,893 --> 01:29:20,896
I'm angry because I know
my dad didn't kill my mom.

1576
01:29:20,897 --> 01:29:22,982
[gentle music playing]

1577
01:29:25,985 --> 01:29:28,821
{\an8}My Auntie Catherine was
in the house that night.

1578
01:29:31,783 --> 01:29:34,993
[Catherine] I do wish that I had
been asked to come over and testify,

1579
01:29:34,994 --> 01:29:39,332
because I'm the only one who
was there the night Mags passed.

1580
01:29:42,043 --> 01:29:44,378
Just after two o'clock,
I'd say, in the morning,

1581
01:29:44,379 --> 01:29:46,963
there was a knock on the
bedroom door, and it was Jason.

1582
01:29:46,964 --> 01:29:51,844
And he said, "Mags isn't well.
She's having a bad asthma attack."

1583
01:29:52,929 --> 01:29:55,348
Mags is in the kitchen
holding her chest.

1584
01:29:56,099 --> 01:29:58,017
She had her inhaler in her hand.

1585
01:29:59,852 --> 01:30:04,148
I watched Jason frantically
do everything to save her.

1586
01:30:04,857 --> 01:30:08,985
Tom Marten was saying that
Mike and him had a conversation

1587
01:30:08,986 --> 01:30:12,614
about how Mag died
on Jason's hands.

1588
01:30:12,615 --> 01:30:17,536
When we heard this, all my family
were enraged, my father especially.

1589
01:30:17,537 --> 01:30:20,164
[Marian] He said, "No
such thing happened."

1590
01:30:21,874 --> 01:30:24,960
"Until the day I die, how
would I ever believe Jason

1591
01:30:24,961 --> 01:30:26,712
had killed my daughter?"

1592
01:30:28,089 --> 01:30:30,173
[Catherine] They had a
beautiful relationship.

1593
01:30:30,174 --> 01:30:31,926
They were a very loving couple.

1594
01:30:32,427 --> 01:30:34,220
[Marian] And
Michael loved Jason.

1595
01:30:34,720 --> 01:30:35,805
He was our son.

1596
01:30:37,890 --> 01:30:41,935
We decided Michael would make
a statement to the solicitor.

1597
01:30:41,936 --> 01:30:44,521
[Catherine] My father
passed away from cancer,

1598
01:30:44,522 --> 01:30:46,941
so we're speaking
on behalf of my dad.

1599
01:30:48,276 --> 01:30:50,611
"Statement of
Michael Fitzpatrick."

1600
01:30:52,071 --> 01:30:55,908
"I wish to put it on record that I
only ever met Thomas Martens once."

1601
01:30:56,409 --> 01:30:58,410
"I can also state categorically

1602
01:30:58,411 --> 01:31:01,121
that we never discussed
my daughter Margaret,

1603
01:31:01,122 --> 01:31:03,331
nor did I inform Thomas Martens

1604
01:31:03,332 --> 01:31:05,625
that Jason had killed
my daughter Margaret."

1605
01:31:05,626 --> 01:31:09,672
"Such statements by Thomas Martens
are totally and utterly untrue."

I'm 19 years of age.

I haven't been able to
speak out for so long,

1617
01:31:52,089 --> 01:31:56,302
and I've had to listen to lies
over the last eight years,

1618
01:31:56,802 --> 01:31:59,222
and this is my opportunity
to say the truth.

1619

[Sarah] I am old enough,
and I am brave enough now.

1620

I've always had someone
else tell my story,

and it's important to me that
I can tell my story myself.

01:33:53,919 --> 01:33:55,587
- Let's do this!
- [all chuckling]

1653
01:33:55,588 --> 01:33:58,382
- [Tracey breathes deeply]
- [David] So, yeah.

1654
01:34:08,726 --> 01:34:10,728
[cameras clicking]

1655
01:34:14,649 --> 01:34:16,651
[tense music playing]

1656
01:34:21,072 --> 01:34:22,864
{\an8}[Jack] <i>I used to pray at
night when I was a kid</i>

1657
01:34:22,865 --> 01:34:25,743
{\an8}<i>that I would wake up and it
would all have been a bad dream.</i>

1658
01:34:26,619 --> 01:34:28,953
{\an8}<i>I've had to experience
childhood, adolescence,</i>

1659
01:34:28,954 --> 01:34:32,040
{\an8}<i>and the beginning of adulthood
without my dad there to guide me.</i>

1660
01:34:32,041 --> 01:34:35,961
<i>Your Honor, don't be fooled by this
mask of civility of Molly Martens.</i>

1661
01:34:36,545 --> 01:34:40,298
<i>She systematically broke me
down and drip-fed me un-truths.</i>

1662
01:34:40,299 --> 01:34:41,341
<i>I want to be clear.</i>

1663
01:34:41,342 --> 01:34:44,553
<i>I have never witnessed my
dad hit Molly Martens, ever.</i>

1664
01:34:46,097 --> 01:34:47,847
[Sarah] <i>Who is the victim here?</i>

1665
01:34:47,848 --> 01:34:50,475
<i>The Martens made my
pain so much worse</i>

1666
01:34:50,476 --> 01:34:53,604
<i>by trying to have the world
think my dad was a bad person.</i>

1667
01:34:54,313 --> 01:34:58,150
<i>What Molly and Tom Martens took
from me, I can never get back.</i>

1668
01:34:59,318 --> 01:35:03,197
<i>I've seen my father's bloody
handprint on the door of his bedroom.</i>

1669
01:35:03,906 --> 01:35:06,784
[sobbing] <i>There was nothing
voluntary about his death.</i>

1670
01:35:11,163 --> 01:35:14,333
<i>He did not choose to leave
us. He was taken from us.</i>

1671
01:35:15,251 --> 01:35:16,836
<i>He was the victim.</i>

1672
01:35:21,799 --> 01:35:23,758
[Jack] <i>Luckily, my dad
picked two wonderful parents</i>

1673
01:35:23,759 --> 01:35:25,344
<i>to guide me through life.</i>

1674
01:35:25,845 --> 01:35:28,723
<i>It hasn't been easy, but having
them made it a lot easier.</i>

1675
01:35:30,641 --> 01:35:34,602
[Sarah] <i>It was only when I went to
live with Tracey and David in Ireland</i>

1676
01:35:34,603 --> 01:35:36,647
<i>that I knew the true
meaning of family.</i>

1677
01:35:41,152 --> 01:35:44,446
Molly Corbett and Thomas
Marten are going back to prison

1678
01:35:44,447 --> 01:35:46,197
for the death of Jason Corbett.

1679
01:35:46,198 --> 01:35:51,077
This afternoon, the judge sentenced
them to 51 to 74 months...

1680
01:35:51,078 --> 01:35:53,621
{\an8}...when you factor in the amount
of time they already served

1681
01:35:53,622 --> 01:35:57,000
{\an8}when they were previously found
guilty for second degree murder,

1682
01:35:57,001 --> 01:35:59,210
{\an8}it only adds up to about
seven or eight months.

1683
01:35:59,211 --> 01:36:01,671
{\an8}[reporter] The judge made it
clear it was difficult for him

1684
01:36:01,672 --> 01:36:03,840
{\an8}to find the truth in this case,

1685
01:36:03,841 --> 01:36:06,301
but made very clear the
kids were blameless.

1686
01:36:06,302 --> 01:36:07,678
That's Jack and Sarah.

1687
01:36:08,262 --> 01:36:11,848
[Jay] I think Molly did the best job
she could do with raising those kids.

1688
01:36:11,849 --> 01:36:14,726
And it was just very
difficult for her

1689
01:36:14,727 --> 01:36:19,731
to have to listen to them saying
that she somehow hurt them,

1690
01:36:19,732 --> 01:36:22,025
um, which I just
don't believe is true.

1691
01:36:22,026 --> 01:36:26,654
I did not emotionally, or physically,
or in any way abuse my children.

1692
01:36:26,655 --> 01:36:30,785
The children have been
used as tools of evil.

1693
01:36:31,494 --> 01:36:34,370
Uh, they've been
weaponized against me.

1694
01:36:34,371 --> 01:36:38,334
And, uh... they wanted
to hurt me, and they did.

1695
01:36:40,211 --> 01:36:42,086
Do I think those
children know the truth?

1696
01:36:42,087 --> 01:36:45,173
I don't know. How do they
remember the times at the beach?

1697
01:36:45,174 --> 01:36:47,676
How do they remember Molly
as the school mother?

1698
01:36:48,260 --> 01:36:50,470
How do they remember
the meals that she made?

1699
01:36:50,471 --> 01:36:52,931
How do they remember
the birthday parties?

1700
01:36:52,932 --> 01:36:56,267
How do they remember her
teaching them how to swim?

1701
01:36:56,268 --> 01:36:57,812
How do they remember?

1702
01:36:59,730 --> 01:37:05,528
How can you remember
that and hate Molly?

1703
01:37:07,071 --> 01:37:11,908
{\an8}Today, Molly Corbett and Thomas Martens
will walk out of their prisons free.

1704
01:37:11,909 --> 01:37:13,994
[cameras clicking]

1705
01:37:15,454 --> 01:37:19,707
[Molly] I am not allowed to attempt
to have any contact with the kids.

1706
01:37:19,708 --> 01:37:21,334
That's a court order.

1707
01:37:21,335 --> 01:37:23,628
When it comes to,
you know, my feelings

1708
01:37:23,629 --> 01:37:26,714
about whether I consider
myself their mother,

1709
01:37:26,715 --> 01:37:29,384
uh, that would cause them
immense pain right now.

1710
01:37:29,385 --> 01:37:32,387
I think that they hate the
person that they think that I am,

1711
01:37:32,388 --> 01:37:35,557
and they think of me
as an evil abuser,

1712
01:37:35,558 --> 01:37:37,768
and they think their
father was wonderful.

1713
01:37:38,352 --> 01:37:40,687
I certainly am not
their mother now.

1714
01:37:40,688 --> 01:37:45,817
Will I always think of myself
as having been their mother?

1715
01:37:45,818 --> 01:37:48,112
Yes, I was. I was their mother.

1716
01:37:48,612 --> 01:37:52,992
I was the mother to the Jack and Sarah
that existed in another lifetime.

1717
01:37:54,994 --> 01:37:56,619
Sarah, how old are you?

1718
01:37:56,620 --> 01:37:57,620
Two.

1719
01:37:58,038 --> 01:37:58,955
[Molly] Two and a half.

1720
01:37:58,956 --> 01:38:00,039
Yeah.

1721
01:38:00,040 --> 01:38:01,207
[Molly] How old are you?

1722
01:38:01,208 --> 01:38:03,501
- Four and a half.
- Are you sure you're not one and a half?

1723
01:38:03,502 --> 01:38:05,503
[Sarah] It is true
that I loved Molly.

1724
01:38:05,504 --> 01:38:09,842
But just because I loved Molly
doesn't make her a good mother.

1725
01:38:10,426 --> 01:38:12,553
- [Molly] Say, "Bye, camera."
- Bye, camera.

1726
01:38:14,638 --> 01:38:17,682
[Jack] <i>I have no feelings
towards her anymore. I don't...</i>

1727
01:38:17,683 --> 01:38:18,767
<i>I don't hate her.</i>

1728
01:38:19,351 --> 01:38:22,104
<i>I just don't want to give her
any power over me anymore.</i>

1729
01:38:25,900 --> 01:38:26,858
[softly] Thank you.

1730
01:38:26,859 --> 01:38:28,944
[uplifting music playing]

1731
01:38:31,989 --> 01:38:34,949
[Jack] I understand how
a lot of people could say

1732
01:38:34,950 --> 01:38:37,410
he's been around people
who loved his dad,

1733
01:38:37,411 --> 01:38:41,205
his dad's family, his dad's
friends for eight years,

1734
01:38:41,206 --> 01:38:43,416
that's why he's
saying these things.

1735
01:38:43,417 --> 01:38:45,502
[indistinct chatter]

1736
01:38:46,462 --> 01:38:51,007
But I was always left to come up with
my own decisions, my own opinions.

1737
01:38:51,008 --> 01:38:53,551
[indistinct conversation]

1738
01:38:53,552 --> 01:38:56,596
[Jack] My dad was my hero. He
was someone I looked up to.

1739
01:38:56,597 --> 01:38:57,806
He was my best friend.

1740
01:38:58,807 --> 01:39:00,309
{\an8}[Jason] There's a gorgeous boy.

1741
01:39:01,435 --> 01:39:03,520
{\an8}Jack, blow Daddy a kiss.

1742
01:39:05,397 --> 01:39:07,148
{\an8}- [Mags chuckling]
- [Jason] Good boy.

1743
01:39:07,149 --> 01:39:08,317
{\an8}Oh, another one.

1744
01:39:09,109 --> 01:39:10,819
[Jack] What are
you doing, Daddy?

1745
01:39:11,487 --> 01:39:12,905
Getting Sarah and Mum.

1746
01:39:13,697 --> 01:39:15,407
They're coming home
to Jack's house.

1747
01:39:15,991 --> 01:39:18,577
Hi, Bubba! Give Daddy a kiss?

1748
01:39:19,703 --> 01:39:21,454
- Did you miss Daddy?
- Hi!

1749
01:39:21,455 --> 01:39:24,625
- See what Daddy bought ya.
- [Mags] Oh, Daddy buy you presents?

1750
01:39:25,125 --> 01:39:28,212
My dad was an amazing
person. He was a good dad.

1751
01:39:29,421 --> 01:39:31,339
He was, like, my
biggest cheerleader.

1752
01:39:31,340 --> 01:39:32,549
[Jason] Go, Sarah!

1753
01:39:36,470 --> 01:39:41,058
[Sarah] I know my dad and my mom
would not want me to sit around upset.

1754
01:39:42,518 --> 01:39:46,229
[Jack] So, you just have to keep
going forward and make them proud,

1755
01:39:46,230 --> 01:39:49,024
and live the life that
they wanted you to live.

1756
01:39:53,320 --> 01:39:55,614
[Sarah] My dad
loved me and Jack.

1757
01:39:56,615 --> 01:39:58,616
We were his everything,
and I know that.

1758
01:39:58,617 --> 01:40:02,078
And I'm really proud to say that
I am Jason Corbett's daughter.

1759
01:40:02,079 --> 01:40:04,164
[music continues]

1760
01:40:13,632 --> 01:40:15,091
[music fades]

1761
01:40:15,092 --> 01:40:19,179
[melancholy music playing]

[music ends]
