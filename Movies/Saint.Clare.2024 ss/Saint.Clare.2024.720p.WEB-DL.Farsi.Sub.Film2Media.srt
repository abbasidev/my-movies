1
00:01:04,064 --> 00:01:05,926
Everything I have said and done

2
00:01:05,927 --> 00:01:07,619
has been in the hands of God.

3
00:01:09,586 --> 00:01:12,520
I was born to do
this, I am not afraid.

4
00:01:13,901 --> 00:01:17,594
Everything I have said and done
has been in the hands of God.

5
00:01:20,218 --> 00:01:24,394
Everything I have said and done
has been in the hands of God.

6
00:01:25,947 --> 00:01:27,810
I was born to do this.

7
00:01:27,811 --> 00:01:29,227
I am not afraid.

8
00:01:37,235 --> 00:01:41,204
Everything I have said and done
has been in the hands of God.

9
00:01:59,671 --> 00:02:03,261
Everything I've said and done
has been in the hands of God.

10
00:02:05,021 --> 00:02:06,849
I was born to do this.

11
00:02:14,375 --> 00:02:15,687
I am not afraid.

12
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:06,487
-Oh, hey.
-Hey.

13
00:04:07,281 --> 00:04:09,213
Why are you sitting over here?

14
00:04:09,214 --> 00:04:10,352
What?

15
00:04:10,353 --> 00:04:12,181
You can't read?
It's not coming.

16
00:04:12,182 --> 00:04:13,286
You gotta walk, man.

17
00:04:13,287 --> 00:04:14,287
-Sorry.
-See ya.

18
00:04:16,532 --> 00:04:17,532
Thanks.

19
00:04:29,441 --> 00:04:30,752
Hi. Hi there.

20
00:04:30,753 --> 00:04:32,547
Excuse me. I'm lost.

21
00:04:32,548 --> 00:04:34,894
I'm looking for a White Sands.

22
00:04:34,895 --> 00:04:36,723
My girls are about to
get out of practice.

23
00:04:36,724 --> 00:04:39,347
You can't look it
up on your phone?

24
00:04:39,348 --> 00:04:42,073
Well, my phone died and one
of my girls took the charger.

25
00:04:42,074 --> 00:04:43,282
I think you know how that goes.

26
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:45,249
You know, I left a
really big meeting

27
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:46,976
just so I could
get here in time.

28
00:04:48,633 --> 00:04:49,668
Dressed like that?

29
00:04:51,912 --> 00:04:54,638
Oh, you're funny.

30
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:55,673
You're funny.

31
00:04:55,674 --> 00:04:58,676
I know White Sands isn't far.

32
00:04:58,677 --> 00:05:01,265
You've gotta take the
interstate to get there.

33
00:05:01,266 --> 00:05:03,716
Um, I'm not totally sure though.

34
00:05:03,717 --> 00:05:05,683
I'm not from around here.

35
00:05:05,684 --> 00:05:06,684
Hey, hang on a second.

36
00:05:06,685 --> 00:05:07,996
I got an idea.

37
00:05:07,997 --> 00:05:10,724
How about I compensate
you for your time?

38
00:05:11,897 --> 00:05:14,209
Just doing my good
deed for the day.

39
00:05:14,210 --> 00:05:15,279
You know what?

40
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:16,763
Speaking of good deeds,
can I offer you a ride?

41
00:05:16,764 --> 00:05:18,075
I mean, where do you need to go?

42
00:05:18,076 --> 00:05:20,249
I'm okay. I'm
waiting for the bus.

43
00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:22,459
You can't be waiting
out here by yourself.

44
00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:23,632
Just come on.

45
00:05:23,633 --> 00:05:24,806
I'll give you a ride.

46
00:05:24,807 --> 00:05:25,876
Look, you got nothing
to worry about.

47
00:05:25,877 --> 00:05:28,224
I am not a creep.
I'm just, I'm a dad.

48
00:05:49,383 --> 00:05:50,383
Um,

49
00:05:51,212 --> 00:05:52,317
what happened here?

50
00:05:53,249 --> 00:05:54,526
Oh, yeah.

51
00:05:55,769 --> 00:05:57,046
I need to get that fixed.

52
00:05:57,943 --> 00:05:58,944
Straight?

53
00:05:59,807 --> 00:06:01,499
-Yes.
-Okay.

54
00:06:16,445 --> 00:06:19,481
So what time were you
supposed to pick them up?

55
00:06:19,482 --> 00:06:21,828
Oh, we got time.

56
00:06:21,829 --> 00:06:23,900
I thought you said
you were in a rush.

57
00:06:27,904 --> 00:06:29,353
Do you smoke around them?

58
00:06:29,354 --> 00:06:34,185
You like to ask
questions, don't you?

59
00:06:41,677 --> 00:06:43,263
Everything I have said and done

60
00:06:43,264 --> 00:06:45,266
has been in the hands of God.

61
00:06:47,924 --> 00:06:49,477
I was born to do this.

62
00:06:49,478 --> 00:06:50,962
I am not afraid.

63
00:06:59,867 --> 00:07:02,974
Everything I have said and done
has been in the hands of God.

64
00:07:04,838 --> 00:07:06,597
Um, I can just get
off at the next light.

65
00:07:06,598 --> 00:07:07,771
-No.
-I can walk from there.

66
00:07:07,772 --> 00:07:09,013
-Yeah.
-I can.

67
00:07:09,014 --> 00:07:11,465
It's really close.

68
00:07:12,777 --> 00:07:13,777
Okey dokes.

69
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:19,541
-You just passed it.
-Aw.

70
00:07:19,542 --> 00:07:20,991
You follow directions
as good as you smell.

71
00:07:20,992 --> 00:07:22,095
No wonder your so lost.

72
00:07:22,096 --> 00:07:23,856
Oh, whoa. Take it
easy little missy.

73
00:07:23,857 --> 00:07:24,995
Where are we going?

74
00:07:24,996 --> 00:07:26,307
Relax, have some of this, okay?

75
00:07:28,171 --> 00:07:30,207
Don't be a big baby, just...

76
00:07:30,208 --> 00:07:31,934
It's, it's good.

77
00:07:33,314 --> 00:07:35,730
Go ahead. Go ahead.
It's all right.

78
00:07:35,731 --> 00:07:36,939
Help you relax.

79
00:07:42,738 --> 00:07:44,048
Everything I have said and done

80
00:07:44,049 --> 00:07:45,568
has been in the hands of God.

81
00:07:49,123 --> 00:07:51,919
I was born to do
this. I'm not afraid.

82
00:07:54,577 --> 00:07:55,888
What was that?

83
00:07:55,889 --> 00:07:57,855
It's a quote from Joan of Arc.

84
00:07:57,856 --> 00:08:00,064
She led the French to
battle against England

85
00:08:00,065 --> 00:08:02,378
and then became a
Saint for her actions.

86
00:08:03,379 --> 00:08:05,069
Right.

87
00:08:05,070 --> 00:08:06,485
Wasn't she burned alive?

88
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:07,556
She was.

89
00:08:09,350 --> 00:08:13,044
She also killed an awful
lot of men before that.

90
00:08:15,702 --> 00:08:17,358
See, you indeed, are correct.

91
00:08:18,567 --> 00:08:21,879
I have nothing to worry
about. Only you do.

92
00:08:24,676 --> 00:08:25,849
What are you doing?

93
00:08:49,908 --> 00:08:51,460
Everything I have said and done

94
00:08:51,461 --> 00:08:53,601
has been in the hands of God.

95
00:09:47,069 --> 00:09:50,140
Dear God, what have
you made of me?

96
00:09:52,039 --> 00:09:53,039
Have mercy.

97
00:09:54,145 --> 00:09:57,078
Have mercy, have
mercy on my soul.

98
00:09:57,079 --> 00:09:58,562
Why don't I feel bad about this?

99
00:09:58,563 --> 00:09:59,563
Why?

100
00:09:59,564 --> 00:10:01,635
Why do I feed on this?

101
00:10:02,429 --> 00:10:03,913
Is it my burden to carry?

102
00:10:05,190 --> 00:10:06,191
My gift?

103
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:08,642
My curse?

104
00:10:10,817 --> 00:10:11,817
Why?

105
00:10:13,233 --> 00:10:15,442
Why have you made me this way?

106
00:10:35,324 --> 00:10:38,878
Oh wow, how darling.

107
00:10:38,879 --> 00:10:40,500
Where have you been?

108
00:10:40,501 --> 00:10:42,088
I've been waiting
here for hours.

109
00:10:42,089 --> 00:10:45,298
You have not just
been waiting, Jules.

110
00:10:45,299 --> 00:10:47,300
We've been dancing.

111
00:10:47,301 --> 00:10:48,992
-She gave me weed.
-Oh.

112
00:10:48,993 --> 00:10:51,857
We were waiting for you
though, to do the peyote.

113
00:10:51,858 --> 00:10:52,996
Okay, Gigi.

114
00:10:52,997 --> 00:10:54,135
Oh, come on.

115
00:10:54,136 --> 00:10:57,000
She knows I'm joking.

116
00:10:57,001 --> 00:10:59,830
Better not drink the tea
tonight though, sweetie.

117
00:10:59,831 --> 00:11:01,038
What?

118
00:11:01,039 --> 00:11:03,420
It smells delicious in
here, what you cooking?

119
00:11:03,421 --> 00:11:04,939
Beef stew.

120
00:11:04,940 --> 00:11:07,286
So, are you just gonna
ignore my question?

121
00:11:07,287 --> 00:11:08,977
Where have you been?

122
00:11:08,978 --> 00:11:10,220
The poli sci exam.

123
00:11:10,221 --> 00:11:11,600
We were supposed to study.

124
00:11:12,844 --> 00:11:14,880
I was waiting for you.

125
00:11:14,881 --> 00:11:16,088
Waited for me?

126
00:11:16,089 --> 00:11:17,468
-Yeah.
-Where?

127
00:11:17,469 --> 00:11:18,884
You know the Goats Cafe.

128
00:11:18,885 --> 00:11:20,058
The Goats?

129
00:11:20,818 --> 00:11:21,818
Yeah.

130
00:11:21,819 --> 00:11:23,267
You said to meet
you at the house.

131
00:11:23,268 --> 00:11:25,062
So why didn't you text me?

132
00:11:25,063 --> 00:11:28,583
Oh, I was zoned out
and my phone died.

133
00:11:28,584 --> 00:11:31,241
Gigi, did you give this girl
the upper or the downer?

134
00:11:31,242 --> 00:11:32,967
'Cause she's 21
questions over here.

135
00:11:32,968 --> 00:11:33,933
Hmm.

136
00:11:33,934 --> 00:11:35,832
Maybe she's more
the ketamine type.

137
00:11:35,833 --> 00:11:37,247
No, I'm just scaring her.

138
00:11:37,248 --> 00:11:39,318
All right, fine.
Let's just eat.

139
00:11:39,319 --> 00:11:42,493
Pre-code films were
whole other thing.

140
00:11:42,494 --> 00:11:49,053
Hollywood in 1931 was a radical
bed of progressive ideas.

141
00:11:49,950 --> 00:11:54,022
And women, women were
just a femme fatale,

142
00:11:54,023 --> 00:11:58,268
or the ingenue, or the
doting wife or the victim.

143
00:11:58,269 --> 00:11:59,579
No.

144
00:11:59,580 --> 00:12:02,169
Women were whole people.

145
00:12:04,482 --> 00:12:07,898
Emancipated from the
harness of how a woman

146
00:12:07,899 --> 00:12:09,762
is supposed to behave.

147
00:12:09,763 --> 00:12:13,386
Now, my mom, Clare's
great grandma

148
00:12:13,387 --> 00:12:15,595
was a Hollywood
screenwriter Oh really.

149
00:12:15,596 --> 00:12:18,115
In the '60s and '70s, yeah,

150
00:12:18,116 --> 00:12:20,739
and she did this one
spaghetti western

151
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:24,259
and that is how I
got into acting.

152
00:12:24,260 --> 00:12:26,710
And I even taught little Clare.

153
00:12:26,711 --> 00:12:30,922
All my favorite screen
combat moves, didn't I?

154
00:12:32,165 --> 00:12:33,511
You never told me that.

155
00:12:37,929 --> 00:12:39,136
Oh!

156
00:12:48,422 --> 00:12:51,286
By the way, I'm sorry for
missing our study day today.

157
00:12:51,287 --> 00:12:52,322
It won't happen again.

158
00:12:52,323 --> 00:12:54,187
Dude, don't sweat
it. We're good.

159
00:12:54,912 --> 00:12:57,396
Um, well text me
when you get home?

160
00:12:57,397 --> 00:12:59,743
Always. Bye.

161
00:12:59,744 --> 00:13:01,090
Oh, and Clare?

162
00:13:02,678 --> 00:13:05,094
Goats was closed today
for a private event.

163
00:13:07,062 --> 00:13:08,235
See you tomorrow.

164
00:14:58,173 --> 00:14:59,414
Hey, there.

165
00:14:59,415 --> 00:15:00,484
Fuck off.

166
00:15:00,485 --> 00:15:01,796
Jesus.

167
00:15:01,797 --> 00:15:04,454
Bob, how many times
do I have to kill you?

168
00:15:04,455 --> 00:15:05,593
Clare Bleeker.

169
00:15:05,594 --> 00:15:07,353
New day, same habit.

170
00:15:07,354 --> 00:15:10,149
Whatever this is, can we just
reschedule it for another time?

171
00:15:10,150 --> 00:15:11,530
I really need to sleep.

172
00:15:11,531 --> 00:15:14,015
That's a big negative,
my auburn vendetta.

173
00:15:14,016 --> 00:15:16,535
Oh hey, that'd be a great
assassin name for you.

174
00:15:16,536 --> 00:15:20,091
Nobody hires me to
do what I do yet.

175
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:23,336
Um, Bob, what is this?

176
00:15:24,268 --> 00:15:25,613
What are you doing here?

177
00:15:25,614 --> 00:15:27,718
I am here representing
the last itsy bitsy piece

178
00:15:27,719 --> 00:15:29,306
of your conscience.

179
00:15:29,307 --> 00:15:31,378
Really? Because I don't
feel bad about what I do.

180
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,725
No? Not even about me?

181
00:15:34,726 --> 00:15:35,830
Thought we were pals.

182
00:15:35,831 --> 00:15:37,694
No, I'm in college.

183
00:15:37,695 --> 00:15:39,178
You're decomposing.

184
00:15:39,179 --> 00:15:43,045
I remember our first encounter
like it was yesterday.

185
00:16:03,445 --> 00:16:05,756
What are you doing down there?

186
00:16:05,757 --> 00:16:10,071
Oh, I'm not doing much.

187
00:16:10,072 --> 00:16:11,453
You know, just...

188
00:16:12,247 --> 00:16:13,247
Are you drunk?

189
00:16:15,319 --> 00:16:16,767
Yeah.

190
00:16:16,768 --> 00:16:18,528
Yes, I have been drinking.

191
00:16:18,529 --> 00:16:19,667
Can you get up?

192
00:16:23,051 --> 00:16:26,363
Oh, I can't.

193
00:16:26,364 --> 00:16:29,228
Okay, I'm gonna call
someone for help.

194
00:16:29,229 --> 00:16:30,609
No, no, no, no.

195
00:16:30,610 --> 00:16:31,783
Please, don't, don't.

196
00:16:33,164 --> 00:16:34,476
Don't call anybody, yeah.

197
00:16:35,270 --> 00:16:36,478
Just give me a hand.

198
00:16:46,591 --> 00:16:48,455
Oh, thank you.

199
00:16:51,044 --> 00:16:52,838
You wanna talk about it?

200
00:16:55,359 --> 00:16:56,359
30 years.

201
00:16:58,776 --> 00:17:00,605
30 years of marriage.

202
00:17:02,124 --> 00:17:03,573
I never even looked
at another woman.

203
00:17:03,574 --> 00:17:06,507
I never thought about
another woman, I never cared.

204
00:17:06,508 --> 00:17:10,649
I find out that she cheated
on me my whole life.

205
00:17:10,650 --> 00:17:14,894
Stepped on and, and,
and taken advantage of

206
00:17:14,895 --> 00:17:17,311
and taken for granted

207
00:17:17,312 --> 00:17:23,387
and over and over and
over and over and over.

208
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:26,216
I never thought.

209
00:17:26,217 --> 00:17:28,495
I never thought that
she would do that to me.

210
00:17:34,156 --> 00:17:36,778
I'm sure you'll find
somebody that cares about you

211
00:17:36,779 --> 00:17:38,264
the way you deserve.

212
00:17:40,404 --> 00:17:41,474
I'm sorry.

213
00:17:48,446 --> 00:17:50,585
Oh, oh, okay.

214
00:17:53,934 --> 00:17:56,282
Okay, getting too tight.

215
00:17:56,937 --> 00:17:57,903
Okay.

216
00:17:57,904 --> 00:18:00,181
Stop, stop.

217
00:18:00,182 --> 00:18:01,251
Get off me!

218
00:18:01,252 --> 00:18:04,875
No, no, no, no, no.

219
00:18:04,876 --> 00:18:06,636
Please, please, please.

220
00:18:16,405 --> 00:18:18,199
What is your point?

221
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:20,650
Why? Why are you haunting me?

222
00:18:20,651 --> 00:18:25,172
You slipped and fell and broke
your dumb head open, okay?

223
00:18:25,173 --> 00:18:27,277
So you can't be my conscience

224
00:18:27,278 --> 00:18:30,522
uttering its last dying breaths
or whatever you just said.

225
00:18:30,523 --> 00:18:32,317
I'm here to warn you.

226
00:18:32,318 --> 00:18:33,318
About?

227
00:18:33,319 --> 00:18:34,940
The man you murdered today.

228
00:18:34,941 --> 00:18:37,839
Oh, please don't tell me I'm
gonna start seeing him too.

229
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:39,980
He did not act alone.

230
00:18:41,050 --> 00:18:43,397
Be mindful of what
you say tomorrow.

231
00:18:43,398 --> 00:18:44,708
To whom?

232
00:18:44,709 --> 00:18:48,229
Be mindful.

233
00:18:48,230 --> 00:18:50,611
Okay, thank you
for being useless.

234
00:18:50,612 --> 00:18:51,647
Goodnight, Bob.

235
00:19:02,279 --> 00:19:03,797
You're still here, Bob.

236
00:19:09,286 --> 00:19:10,493
I don't know.

237
00:19:10,494 --> 00:19:11,942
I heard the detective
on this case

238
00:19:11,943 --> 00:19:13,254
is like a sexy fox.

239
00:19:13,255 --> 00:19:16,015
Who cares? This whole
thing is so psycho.

240
00:19:16,016 --> 00:19:18,328
When Theresa went missing,
they didn't do half the crap

241
00:19:18,329 --> 00:19:20,192
they're making us do right now.

242
00:19:20,193 --> 00:19:21,607
Wait, the girl went missing?

243
00:19:21,608 --> 00:19:23,713
Wait, who's the guy?

244
00:19:23,714 --> 00:19:25,784
I don't know, but look,
see these two girls

245
00:19:25,785 --> 00:19:28,476
from our school, they were
the last people that saw him.

246
00:19:28,477 --> 00:19:31,686
And they told me, pretended
like he needed directions

247
00:19:31,687 --> 00:19:34,102
to help pick up his daughters.

248
00:19:34,103 --> 00:19:36,450
Men should never
ask for directions.

249
00:19:36,451 --> 00:19:39,107
Fact check. Homie
had no daughters.

250
00:19:39,108 --> 00:19:41,282
-Classic.
-Shocking.

251
00:19:41,283 --> 00:19:44,043
-Just trifling, you know.
-There's a girl missing?

252
00:19:44,044 --> 00:19:46,184
These girls are so cool.

253
00:19:46,185 --> 00:19:47,599
They don't even hear you.

254
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:49,842
So a girl went missing?

255
00:19:49,843 --> 00:19:52,707
Yeah, it was last
year, Theresa Holmes.

256
00:19:52,708 --> 00:19:55,020
She was so kind,
she was talented.

257
00:19:55,021 --> 00:19:56,194
Okay.

258
00:19:56,195 --> 00:19:58,437
She was in other people's
boyfriends is what she was.

259
00:19:58,438 --> 00:19:59,542
Okay, sis.

260
00:19:59,543 --> 00:20:01,716
Well it wasn't her
sis of her sis?

261
00:20:01,717 --> 00:20:04,823
Anyway, they found traces
of GHB and fentanyl

262
00:20:04,824 --> 00:20:06,445
and a flask in his car.

263
00:20:06,446 --> 00:20:08,551
So those girls dodged a bullet.

264
00:20:08,552 --> 00:20:10,381
-I knew it.
-Knew what?

265
00:20:11,313 --> 00:20:15,005
Um, oh in my head, in my head,
I was thinking about something.

266
00:20:15,006 --> 00:20:17,698
God you are so hot
but so weird Clare.

267
00:20:19,770 --> 00:20:21,495
So did they say anything else?

268
00:20:21,496 --> 00:20:23,462
No, but I mean, it had
to be after school hours

269
00:20:23,463 --> 00:20:24,808
or they wouldn't be
interrogating us.

270
00:20:24,809 --> 00:20:27,052
Interrogating?

271
00:20:27,053 --> 00:20:29,019
Wait, is that what's
happening here?

272
00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:30,400
Yes, Einstein.

273
00:20:30,401 --> 00:20:32,091
What do you think we're in
line for, a juice press?

274
00:20:32,092 --> 00:20:33,300
Oh my God, I need an alibi.

275
00:20:33,301 --> 00:20:35,060
-Why?
-I invoke the Sixth.

276
00:20:35,061 --> 00:20:36,579
It's the Fifth, Amity.

277
00:20:36,580 --> 00:20:38,063
And you're not gonna do well
in there without an alibi

278
00:20:38,064 --> 00:20:39,340
for yesterday afternoon.

279
00:20:39,341 --> 00:20:40,755
Can you be my alibi?

280
00:20:40,756 --> 00:20:42,792
-You're so cute, but I can't.
-Why?

281
00:20:42,793 --> 00:20:45,070
Firstly, you wouldn't be
able to bear the pressure

282
00:20:45,071 --> 00:20:46,416
of a cross-interrogation

283
00:20:46,417 --> 00:20:48,176
and would likely end
crushed by the web of lies

284
00:20:48,177 --> 00:20:49,557
of your own making.

285
00:20:49,558 --> 00:20:51,766
Secondly, a false
testimony in a murder case

286
00:20:51,767 --> 00:20:53,285
is a federal charge.

287
00:20:53,286 --> 00:20:55,011
Third of all, you don't
actually think they're looking

288
00:20:55,012 --> 00:20:57,013
for a suspect amongst us, right?

289
00:20:57,014 --> 00:20:58,014
I don't know.

290
00:20:58,015 --> 00:20:59,257
Juliana LeBlanc.

291
00:20:59,258 --> 00:21:00,466
Here.

292
00:21:05,712 --> 00:21:09,059
This is ridiculous and
a dumb waste of my time.

293
00:21:09,060 --> 00:21:11,061
By the way, I knew
it was the Fifth.

294
00:21:11,062 --> 00:21:13,685
I mean, I was so,
so obviously joking.

295
00:21:13,686 --> 00:21:15,997
It's just like Juliana needs
to get off her high horse.

296
00:21:15,998 --> 00:21:18,206
You know? She thinks
I'm not smart,

297
00:21:18,207 --> 00:21:21,831
but I always get the
last laugh in the end.

298
00:21:21,832 --> 00:21:23,350
Remember that, Clare.

299
00:21:23,351 --> 00:21:25,352
So a juice press is so 2012.

300
00:21:25,353 --> 00:21:27,354
Anyway, it's like, who's
standing in line for a juice?

301
00:21:27,355 --> 00:21:29,114
Wait, why don't you
wanna tell anyone

302
00:21:29,115 --> 00:21:30,978
where you were yesterday?

303
00:21:30,979 --> 00:21:33,325
Because it's private.

304
00:21:33,326 --> 00:21:34,775
Clare Bleeker.

305
00:21:34,776 --> 00:21:36,363
Yeah, good luck with that, kid.

306
00:21:36,364 --> 00:21:38,883
Let's hope Juliana is as good
a friend as she says she is.

307
00:21:45,545 --> 00:21:47,374
Clare, this is
Detective Timmons.

308
00:21:47,375 --> 00:21:49,652
Miss Bleeker is one
of our newer student.

309
00:21:49,653 --> 00:21:52,102
She's an East Coast transplant.

310
00:21:52,103 --> 00:21:54,002
Oh yeah, where on
the East Coast?

311
00:22:00,388 --> 00:22:01,491
New York.

312
00:22:01,492 --> 00:22:02,907
What got you moving here?

313
00:22:06,670 --> 00:22:08,119
Dead parents.

314
00:22:11,088 --> 00:22:12,744
Um...

315
00:22:12,745 --> 00:22:14,367
I'm sorry to hear that.

316
00:22:16,058 --> 00:22:17,335
All right, Miss Bleeker,

317
00:22:17,336 --> 00:22:18,715
I don't wish to take
too much of your time,

318
00:22:18,716 --> 00:22:20,510
but can you walk us
through your day yesterday

319
00:22:20,511 --> 00:22:22,271
from about 2:00 PM to 8:00 PM?

320
00:22:23,514 --> 00:22:24,722
Mm-hmm.

321
00:22:25,309 --> 00:22:26,827
Yeah, um...

322
00:22:30,141 --> 00:22:31,798
Started at school.

323
00:22:33,317 --> 00:22:34,248
Yeah.

324
00:22:34,249 --> 00:22:38,045
Then I went to the bus stop.

325
00:22:38,046 --> 00:22:40,081
Which bus? The
bus up on campus?

326
00:22:40,082 --> 00:22:41,843
It's not coming.

327
00:22:42,084 --> 00:22:43,982
Yeah, yeah.

328
00:22:43,983 --> 00:22:45,087
On campus.

329
00:22:46,503 --> 00:22:47,848
And what happened next?

330
00:22:54,165 --> 00:22:57,927
I was reading a
book and I went home

331
00:22:57,928 --> 00:23:00,619
and had a study
date with my friend.

332
00:23:07,351 --> 00:23:08,662
Which friend was that?

333
00:23:08,663 --> 00:23:09,904
LeBlanc.

334
00:23:09,905 --> 00:23:11,112
Um...

335
00:23:11,113 --> 00:23:12,874
And then, then...

336
00:23:13,357 --> 00:23:14,702
we had dinner with my...

337
00:23:14,703 --> 00:23:15,634
I had a study date...

338
00:23:15,635 --> 00:23:16,842
-Clare.
-Grandma.

339
00:23:16,843 --> 00:23:18,568
-Clare.
-Detective to repeat it.

340
00:23:18,569 --> 00:23:19,743
Clare.

341
00:23:20,744 --> 00:23:21,814
Sorry?

342
00:23:23,643 --> 00:23:25,369
I said you can go.

343
00:23:27,026 --> 00:23:28,302
Okay.

344
00:23:28,303 --> 00:23:30,305
Well, you know where to
find me if you need me.

345
00:23:33,377 --> 00:23:34,688
You have pets?

346
00:23:34,689 --> 00:23:38,175
No, just bad habits.

347
00:23:44,768 --> 00:23:45,837
Well, it's like I always say.

348
00:23:45,838 --> 00:23:47,045
Don't.

349
00:23:47,046 --> 00:23:49,219
- I'm just saying- - Don't.

350
00:23:49,220 --> 00:23:51,015
I didn't think it went that bad.

351
00:23:52,223 --> 00:23:53,500
Yeah, right.

352
00:23:53,501 --> 00:23:56,882
It went fucking amazing
because I blacked out

353
00:23:56,883 --> 00:23:58,884
and I have absolutely

354
00:23:58,885 --> 00:24:01,266
no recollection of
what I just said.

355
00:24:01,267 --> 00:24:03,994
Ah, don't say, oh, Uncle
Bob didn't warn you.

356
00:24:08,792 --> 00:24:10,069
Well, look who it is...

357
00:24:11,588 --> 00:24:12,588
Clare Bleeker.

358
00:24:12,830 --> 00:24:14,313
Um,

359
00:24:14,314 --> 00:24:16,350
I'm sorry, what,
what is your name?

360
00:24:18,491 --> 00:24:19,457
You're funny.

361
00:24:19,458 --> 00:24:21,079
Amity told me you were funny.

362
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:23,358
Amity's ex, ah...

363
00:24:24,877 --> 00:24:26,947
Cool. I, I have to go.

364
00:24:26,948 --> 00:24:29,018
Wait, where to?
You need a ride?

365
00:24:29,019 --> 00:24:30,227
No, I...

366
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:32,400
uh...

367
00:24:33,989 --> 00:24:35,852
yeah, actually, yeah. Yes.

368
00:24:47,589 --> 00:24:50,591
Yeah, and then just right
up this street is my house.

369
00:24:50,592 --> 00:24:52,179
...homicide case.

370
00:24:52,180 --> 00:24:55,458
So what happened with you
and Truman earlier today?

371
00:24:55,459 --> 00:24:57,391
...tragically found dead.

372
00:24:57,392 --> 00:24:59,497
-Huh?
-In the hallway.

373
00:24:59,498 --> 00:25:03,052
I saw you guys, looked
like some tension.

374
00:25:03,053 --> 00:25:05,226
Oh, that kid is whack.

375
00:25:05,227 --> 00:25:06,469
He deserved it.

376
00:25:07,540 --> 00:25:09,058
Why did he deserve it?

377
00:25:09,059 --> 00:25:10,093
Well, it seems
like police arrived

378
00:25:10,094 --> 00:25:11,025
at the scene this morning.

379
00:25:11,026 --> 00:25:12,717
Amity didn't tell you?

380
00:25:12,718 --> 00:25:14,339
Tell me what?

381
00:25:14,340 --> 00:25:15,927
He's been identified
as Joe Morton.

382
00:25:15,928 --> 00:25:19,309
Look, all you need to
know is he did something

383
00:25:19,310 --> 00:25:22,002
he regretted and he
won't do it again.

384
00:25:22,003 --> 00:25:24,349
...a targeted attack.

385
00:25:24,350 --> 00:25:25,453
Targeted attack?

386
00:25:25,454 --> 00:25:26,869
Well, this is me.

387
00:25:26,870 --> 00:25:28,560
Investigators are trying-

388
00:25:28,561 --> 00:25:31,011
That was easy and painless.

389
00:25:31,012 --> 00:25:32,564
So maybe we'll hop in again.

390
00:25:32,565 --> 00:25:33,566
Thank you.

391
00:25:36,673 --> 00:25:37,673
Hey, Clare.

392
00:25:38,433 --> 00:25:39,675
Look, I know you're new in town,

393
00:25:39,676 --> 00:25:41,505
but I'm throwing
a party tonight.

394
00:25:42,299 --> 00:25:43,989
Would you wanna come?

395
00:25:43,990 --> 00:25:44,956
Not with me, not with me.

396
00:25:44,957 --> 00:25:48,167
Just you or others if you want?

397
00:25:50,445 --> 00:25:51,446
Yeah?

398
00:25:54,276 --> 00:25:57,037
Yeah, yeah. Why not?

399
00:25:57,038 --> 00:25:58,384
Awesome.

400
00:25:58,971 --> 00:26:00,868
And just can you
do me one thing?

401
00:26:00,869 --> 00:26:05,045
Just, don't tell
Amity I invited you.

402
00:26:05,046 --> 00:26:07,323
I just don't want
it to be a thing.

403
00:26:07,324 --> 00:26:09,083
You know what I mean?

404
00:26:09,084 --> 00:26:10,326
Okay.

405
00:26:11,293 --> 00:26:13,157
All right. Dope.
I'll see you tonight.

406
00:26:15,056 --> 00:26:17,333
All right, party!

407
00:26:17,334 --> 00:26:19,162
I'm gonna come by about seven.
We'll get ready together.

408
00:26:19,163 --> 00:26:20,579
It's gonna be awesome.

409
00:26:24,859 --> 00:26:27,999
I don't know how
you girls do it.

410
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,864
I, ah, gosh.

411
00:26:30,865 --> 00:26:34,039
This is both painful and
difficult at the same time.

412
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:36,697
Wow, Bob, you've been
dead for only a month

413
00:26:36,698 --> 00:26:40,736
and you've already summed up
the entire female experience.

414
00:26:40,737 --> 00:26:42,738
Okay, stop that. I cannot
let you do this anymore.

415
00:26:42,739 --> 00:26:44,292
This is painful.

416
00:26:46,018 --> 00:26:47,019
Close.

417
00:26:48,020 --> 00:26:49,538
Okay, stay still.

418
00:26:56,442 --> 00:27:00,860
Bob, where do you go
when you're not like...

419
00:27:03,311 --> 00:27:04,518
Here?

420
00:27:04,519 --> 00:27:07,763
Yeah, like why aren't
you in heaven yet?

421
00:27:07,764 --> 00:27:12,077
Are you on some type
of heaven probation or?

422
00:27:12,078 --> 00:27:13,390
Why do you ask?

423
00:27:14,046 --> 00:27:18,637
Just wondering if you'd seen
my mom and dad by any chance?

424
00:27:20,017 --> 00:27:21,604
I have not.

425
00:27:27,853 --> 00:27:31,650
I think about them
a lot actually.

426
00:27:34,411 --> 00:27:36,688
I know that what
I'm doing is right.

427
00:27:36,689 --> 00:27:39,173
I can, I just feel
it in my soul.

428
00:27:39,174 --> 00:27:42,521
But then I think maybe
they're up there looking down

429
00:27:42,522 --> 00:27:47,251
and saying, normal
Clare Bleeker is enough.

430
00:27:48,943 --> 00:27:50,841
Maybe they're up there thinking

431
00:27:52,015 --> 00:27:54,741
that they want
normal Clare Bleeker

432
00:27:54,742 --> 00:27:57,157
to have some normal fun.

433
00:28:02,128 --> 00:28:03,440
No more killing.

434
00:28:12,483 --> 00:28:14,796
I am the result
of a fallen world.

435
00:28:19,974 --> 00:28:24,150
But has to give light,
last endure burning.

436
00:28:45,275 --> 00:28:46,621
What's that smell?

437
00:28:47,622 --> 00:28:48,623
Regrets.

438
00:28:49,969 --> 00:28:51,625
This is good.

439
00:28:51,626 --> 00:28:55,561
See, this is the
acceptable kind of trouble.

440
00:28:57,011 --> 00:28:58,529
Juliana meeting us here?

441
00:28:59,289 --> 00:29:00,772
No.

442
00:29:00,773 --> 00:29:02,118
Why?

443
00:29:02,119 --> 00:29:04,051
Because I didn't tell her.

444
00:29:04,052 --> 00:29:05,259
Why not?

445
00:29:05,260 --> 00:29:07,572
Bob, why try to kill the
mood with all the questions?

446
00:29:07,573 --> 00:29:11,403
Okay? This is a night for
us to get out and be normal

447
00:29:11,404 --> 00:29:13,543
and be social.

448
00:29:13,544 --> 00:29:15,960
Bob and Clare, Bob and
Clare. Are you with me?

449
00:29:15,961 --> 00:29:18,134
Okay? Watch me, be normal.

450
00:29:18,135 --> 00:29:20,274
Hey, you, you.

451
00:29:24,072 --> 00:29:25,072
Mm.

452
00:29:26,212 --> 00:29:27,454
Oh my God.

453
00:29:28,490 --> 00:29:30,664
No. No more. No, I don't.

454
00:29:30,665 --> 00:29:32,942
You photograph
disgustingly well.

455
00:29:32,943 --> 00:29:34,875
Emphasis on
disgusting by the way.

456
00:29:34,876 --> 00:29:36,256
Didn't expect to see
you here tonight.

457
00:29:36,257 --> 00:29:37,291
Same.

458
00:29:37,292 --> 00:29:39,052
Well, I'm here on a work night.

459
00:29:39,053 --> 00:29:40,639
Just a mere and humble observant

460
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:42,952
of this wild fucking
human display.

461
00:29:42,953 --> 00:29:45,161
Hmm. What kind
of work is that?

462
00:29:45,162 --> 00:29:47,301
Well, I'm actually,
I'm working on a series

463
00:29:47,302 --> 00:29:51,029
titled Demented Debauchery of
Intoxicated College Students.

464
00:29:51,030 --> 00:29:53,273
-Oh.
-It'll make for like an edgy,

465
00:29:53,274 --> 00:29:55,137
pricey coffee table book
somewhere, I don't know.

466
00:29:55,138 --> 00:29:58,761
Glad to be collecting dust
in some old dude's house.

467
00:29:58,762 --> 00:30:00,280
What makes you think
you made the cut?

468
00:30:00,281 --> 00:30:01,729
Clearly, I am the cover.

469
00:30:01,730 --> 00:30:04,111
I'm just demented
debauchery at its finest.

470
00:30:06,597 --> 00:30:08,081
Wow.

471
00:30:08,082 --> 00:30:11,360
So what brings you here on
this delectable evening?

472
00:30:11,361 --> 00:30:14,087
A ghost of a dead
mailman that haunts me

473
00:30:14,088 --> 00:30:15,365
told me to do it.

474
00:30:16,642 --> 00:30:19,058
Better tell lover boy I
come with the package.

475
00:30:20,197 --> 00:30:21,611
Get it?

476
00:30:21,612 --> 00:30:24,131
So what else did this ghost
tell you to do, Clare?

477
00:30:24,132 --> 00:30:25,615
I'd rather not say.

478
00:30:25,616 --> 00:30:27,341
Let's just drop the
ghost. Drop the ghost.

479
00:30:27,342 --> 00:30:29,067
-Shall we, you wanna go inside?
-Fuck the ghost

480
00:30:29,068 --> 00:30:30,241
for the rest of the night?

481
00:30:30,242 --> 00:30:31,380
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

482
00:30:31,381 --> 00:30:34,072
-I'll be your ghost.
-Yeah, he's not cool at all.

It's upstairs.

496
00:32:24,218 --> 00:32:26,013
You want me to wait for you?

497
00:32:26,979 --> 00:32:28,291
Okay.

498
00:32:59,908 --> 00:33:02,670
Cops are here! Cops are here!

499
00:33:20,999 --> 00:33:22,965
Why is Timmons here?

500
00:33:22,966 --> 00:33:26,556
Is anybody up there?
Need your IDs out.

501
00:33:54,446 --> 00:33:55,447
Fuck.

502
00:33:58,312 --> 00:34:00,038
What the? What the fuck?

503
00:34:10,876 --> 00:34:11,876
Whoa.

504
00:34:12,188 --> 00:34:14,016
Uh, hi.

505
00:34:14,017 --> 00:34:15,294
What's up, but?

506
00:34:16,916 --> 00:34:18,263
How'd you find my room?

507
00:34:19,229 --> 00:34:20,713
That's your room?

508
00:34:21,818 --> 00:34:23,301
Yeah, I didn't know that.

509
00:34:23,302 --> 00:34:24,854
I checked all the doors,

510
00:34:24,855 --> 00:34:27,340
but they were all
locked and yours wasn't.

511
00:34:27,341 --> 00:34:29,825
So, yeah you know, the cops.

512
00:34:29,826 --> 00:34:31,758
I was trying to hide.

513
00:34:31,759 --> 00:34:33,312
This is pretty annoying.

514
00:34:33,933 --> 00:34:35,106
Yeah.

515
00:34:35,107 --> 00:34:36,556
It's just a noise complaint

516
00:34:36,557 --> 00:34:38,661
but people inevitably bring
drugs to these things.

517
00:34:38,662 --> 00:34:41,009
So, cops stay a lot
longer than they should.

518
00:34:47,947 --> 00:34:49,846
What are you hiding,
Clare Bleeker?

519
00:34:50,709 --> 00:34:52,710
And why are you even in there?

520
00:34:52,711 --> 00:34:54,505
Are you running from the cops?

521
00:34:54,506 --> 00:34:57,266
Everybody started
bolting, so I did.

522
00:34:57,267 --> 00:34:59,303
All right, well look,
make yourself comfortable

523
00:34:59,304 --> 00:35:01,133
'cause it's, it's
gonna be a while.

524
00:35:04,102 --> 00:35:06,482
You know, half my
nicotine addiction

525
00:35:06,483 --> 00:35:08,795
comes from manual fixation,

526
00:35:11,385 --> 00:35:13,939
which I don't get from vaping.

527
00:35:15,941 --> 00:35:17,597
I have to go.

528
00:35:17,598 --> 00:35:18,736
Wait, are you sure?

529
00:35:18,737 --> 00:35:20,462
Yeah, I have to be home.

530
00:35:20,463 --> 00:35:22,533
Look, I would not risk
that if I were you.

531
00:35:22,534 --> 00:35:24,086
I gotta get home.

532
00:36:37,505 --> 00:36:42,545
No, I couldn't get
anybody tonight.

533
00:36:49,172 --> 00:36:51,035
Death is more welcome
here than you.

534
00:36:51,036 --> 00:36:52,658
Next!
-Next.

535
00:36:55,247 --> 00:36:56,385
Hey, Amity.

536
00:36:56,386 --> 00:36:58,594
How are you?
-Clare, wish me luck.

537
00:36:58,595 --> 00:37:01,218
Actually, don't
you say break a leg

538
00:37:01,219 --> 00:37:03,047
'cause we're in the theater, so.

539
00:37:03,048 --> 00:37:05,014
What part are you
auditioning for?

540
00:37:05,015 --> 00:37:08,708
Myra. Obviously,
the female lead.

541
00:37:08,709 --> 00:37:12,574
You know what? You
actually have a Helga vibe.

542
00:37:12,575 --> 00:37:14,576
Clare Voyant.

543
00:37:14,577 --> 00:37:15,922
You see what I did
there with your name?

544
00:37:15,923 --> 00:37:17,095
It's supporting but.

545
00:37:17,096 --> 00:37:19,443
I actually related a bit more

546
00:37:19,444 --> 00:37:21,790
to the two male protagonist.

547
00:37:21,791 --> 00:37:22,860
You would.

548
00:37:22,861 --> 00:37:25,242
Yeah, also he die's
after the first act.

549
00:37:25,243 --> 00:37:27,623
The only thing you're
projecting is vomit.

550
00:37:27,624 --> 00:37:28,797
Next!

551
00:37:28,798 --> 00:37:30,108
Amity, I wanted to
just talk to you

552
00:37:30,109 --> 00:37:33,905
about something
pretty important.

553
00:37:33,906 --> 00:37:35,182
Okay? Shoot.

554
00:37:35,183 --> 00:37:37,702
What was your relationship
like with Wade?

555
00:37:37,703 --> 00:37:38,772
Why?

556
00:37:38,773 --> 00:37:40,981
Did he ever say anything

557
00:37:40,982 --> 00:37:43,605
or make you do anything
that felt forced?

558
00:37:43,606 --> 00:37:44,675
What are you asking me?

559
00:37:44,676 --> 00:37:49,196
If he put you in a position-

560
00:37:49,197 --> 00:37:52,130
Why are you all of a
sudden curious about Wade?

561
00:37:52,131 --> 00:37:53,442
Did he ask you out?

562
00:37:53,443 --> 00:37:57,204
No, I barely saw
him the other night.

563
00:37:57,205 --> 00:37:58,620
The other night?

564
00:37:58,621 --> 00:37:59,621
Like at his party?

565
00:38:00,657 --> 00:38:05,800
So you went to my
ex's party without us?

566
00:38:06,456 --> 00:38:08,319
Do you know how
sketchy that sounds?

567
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:09,424
Amity-

568
00:38:09,425 --> 00:38:10,701
We're trying to prep.

569
00:38:10,702 --> 00:38:12,496
Okay, you shut up!

570
00:38:12,497 --> 00:38:13,669
Amity, it wasn't like that.

571
00:38:13,670 --> 00:38:15,050
That's exactly
what Theresa said.

572
00:38:15,051 --> 00:38:16,707
What does Theresa have
to do it with this?

573
00:38:16,708 --> 00:38:17,708
Oh God.

574
00:38:17,709 --> 00:38:19,675
I'd rather pass a kidney stone.

575
00:38:19,676 --> 00:38:20,711
Next.

576
00:38:20,712 --> 00:38:21,781
I have to audition.

577
00:38:21,782 --> 00:38:23,886
Amity, darling.

578
00:38:23,887 --> 00:38:25,474
Mwah. Mwah.
-Mwah. Mwah.

579
00:38:25,475 --> 00:38:28,443
Finally, a true thespian
in the sea of dilettantes.

580
00:38:28,444 --> 00:38:29,651
They're all Philistines.

581
00:38:29,652 --> 00:38:32,517
Entre vous.

582
00:38:40,628 --> 00:38:42,077
A girl went missing?

583
00:38:42,078 --> 00:38:44,632
Yeah, it was last
year, Theresa Holmes.

584
00:39:36,304 --> 00:39:38,098
Have you seen my text?

585
00:39:38,099 --> 00:39:39,307
My phone's been off.

586
00:39:42,276 --> 00:39:44,933
I'm just gonna get to the point.

587
00:39:44,934 --> 00:39:48,315
There is something
really, really-

588
00:39:48,316 --> 00:39:50,628
I thought you were gonna get
straight to the point, Clare.

589
00:39:50,629 --> 00:39:51,630
Okay.

590
00:39:54,322 --> 00:39:55,599
I found photos of Amity

591
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:56,876
that I don't think
she wanted to taken.

592
00:39:56,877 --> 00:39:59,016
And there was another
of a missing girl,

593
00:39:59,017 --> 00:40:01,018
she went missing last year.

594
00:40:01,019 --> 00:40:05,885
And then I found photos of you.

595
00:40:05,886 --> 00:40:07,956
-What?
-You were unconscious.

596
00:40:07,957 --> 00:40:09,336
Well, I don't do drugs
and I don't drink.

597
00:40:09,337 --> 00:40:11,960
So frankly, I don't know
what you're talking about.

598
00:40:11,961 --> 00:40:13,927
I know what I saw.

599
00:40:13,928 --> 00:40:15,239
I'm trying to help you.

600
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:17,275
Has Wade done anything or said-

601
00:40:17,276 --> 00:40:18,380
Wade?

602
00:40:18,381 --> 00:40:19,864
It was in his room, the photos.

603
00:40:19,865 --> 00:40:21,003
So you did hook up with him?

604
00:40:21,004 --> 00:40:23,385
What? No, I didn't
hook up with him.

605
00:40:23,386 --> 00:40:26,043
Clare, listen, I
like you and all,

606
00:40:26,044 --> 00:40:27,769
but you just got
here six months ago

607
00:40:27,770 --> 00:40:29,771
whilst I've known Amity
since middle school.

608
00:40:29,772 --> 00:40:31,289
Now, I don't give a damn

609
00:40:31,290 --> 00:40:32,774
that you hooked up with
her ex or whatever-

610
00:40:32,775 --> 00:40:34,396
- I didn't hook- -
It doesn't matter.

611
00:40:34,397 --> 00:40:37,572
But if you think I'm not
keeping track of all the lies

612
00:40:37,573 --> 00:40:39,712
you've been spewing
regularly, you are wrong.

613
00:40:39,713 --> 00:40:40,920
What lies?

614
00:40:40,921 --> 00:40:42,335
Goats Cafe, Clare, or the party

615
00:40:42,336 --> 00:40:44,095
you didn't think of
inviting your friends to.

616
00:40:44,096 --> 00:40:45,890
-Oh my God. This is different.
-And now it turns out you were

617
00:40:45,891 --> 00:40:46,996
Wade's bedroom.

618
00:40:47,997 --> 00:40:49,722
You're a little
dishonest, Clare.

619
00:40:49,723 --> 00:40:51,482
This, this is what matters.

620
00:40:51,483 --> 00:40:55,072
You're smart, you're pretty,
but you're dishonest.

621
00:40:55,073 --> 00:40:56,418
- This is- - If you
really think there's

622
00:40:56,419 --> 00:40:58,316
something wrong, then why
not just go to the police?

623
00:40:58,317 --> 00:40:59,595
Hmm?

624
00:41:01,217 --> 00:41:02,321
Precisely.

625
00:41:06,878 --> 00:41:08,224
Later, Clare.

626
00:41:25,690 --> 00:41:26,724
Mr. Edwards.

627
00:41:26,725 --> 00:41:28,692
-Uh-uh, no ma'am.
-Ah, Mr. Edwards?

628
00:41:28,693 --> 00:41:29,762
Not today.

629
00:41:29,763 --> 00:41:31,660
Auditions are over. No.

630
00:41:31,661 --> 00:41:33,282
-But Mr. Edwards.
-Director.

631
00:41:33,283 --> 00:41:36,113
Director Edwards. I have
this proposition for you.

632
00:41:36,114 --> 00:41:37,390
Mm.

633
00:41:37,391 --> 00:41:40,738
Because someone as
riveting as yourself

634
00:41:40,739 --> 00:41:43,672
should not settle for
just small town production

635
00:41:43,673 --> 00:41:45,640
of a spell binding
piece of literature.

636
00:41:45,641 --> 00:41:47,849
Your vision is Broadway or-

637
00:41:47,850 --> 00:41:49,747
We're working in here.

638
00:41:49,748 --> 00:41:51,059
Carry on.

639
00:41:51,060 --> 00:41:53,786
Because you're like, then
you're just this true feminist.

640
00:41:53,787 --> 00:41:56,409
You're a trailblazer,
Mr. Edwards.

641
00:41:56,410 --> 00:41:58,342
Can I assist you?

642
00:41:58,343 --> 00:42:00,344
No, I don't babysit.

643
00:42:00,345 --> 00:42:02,449
But I did come up with
the best idea right now.

644
00:42:02,450 --> 00:42:03,830
It just popped into my brain.

645
00:42:03,831 --> 00:42:05,522
Gender is a construct.

646
00:42:05,523 --> 00:42:08,594
So you can play the
male lead, Sidney Brule.

647
00:42:08,595 --> 00:42:09,595
Oh, great idea.

648
00:42:09,596 --> 00:42:10,872
Opposite Amity Liston.

649
00:42:10,873 --> 00:42:13,633
And if you are late
ever again, you're out.

650
00:42:13,634 --> 00:42:14,979
Move it.
-Okay, great.

651
00:42:14,980 --> 00:42:16,947
I'm out of here.
I'm off the clock.

652
00:42:31,100 --> 00:42:32,445
Miss Bleeker, may I
have a word with you

653
00:42:32,446 --> 00:42:33,654
in the dean's office?

654
00:42:34,966 --> 00:42:37,140
Yeah, of course.

655
00:42:40,834 --> 00:42:42,559
Clare, do you remember
last time we spoke

656
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:44,113
that it was about Joe Morton?

657
00:42:45,114 --> 00:42:46,355
Who?

658
00:42:46,356 --> 00:42:48,599
The man who was
murdered in his car.

659
00:42:48,600 --> 00:42:51,395
Oh, right. What about it?

660
00:42:51,396 --> 00:42:54,156
Well, the victim's only
witnesses recently testified

661
00:42:54,157 --> 00:42:56,331
that they saw a
redheaded girl waiting

662
00:42:56,332 --> 00:42:58,472
at the campus bus stop
the day of the murder.

663
00:42:59,542 --> 00:43:02,096
But what time exactly did
you get home that night?

664
00:43:04,374 --> 00:43:07,031
Forgive me I'm,

665
00:43:07,032 --> 00:43:09,310
having a little deja vu here.

666
00:43:09,656 --> 00:43:11,760
Ah well, let's see.

667
00:43:11,761 --> 00:43:13,106
The bus was late.

668
00:43:13,107 --> 00:43:17,076
I was reading a book and
I lost track of time,

669
00:43:17,077 --> 00:43:19,217
and then I went home.

670
00:43:20,494 --> 00:43:23,738
I had a study date with my
friend, Juliana LeBlanc.

671
00:43:23,739 --> 00:43:26,775
And then we made dinner
with my grandma Gigi.

672
00:43:26,776 --> 00:43:29,053
And then I just went to bed.

673
00:43:29,054 --> 00:43:31,159
Well, we spoke with your
grandmother earlier today.

674
00:43:31,160 --> 00:43:32,401
Hmm.

675
00:43:32,402 --> 00:43:34,197
She said you were
three hours late.

676
00:43:35,233 --> 00:43:36,785
Okay, and?

677
00:43:36,786 --> 00:43:39,789
And Juliana didn't mention
that when we interrogated her.

678
00:43:41,688 --> 00:43:42,929
She must have forgot.

679
00:43:42,930 --> 00:43:45,449
Doesn't really seem
like a relevant detail.

680
00:43:45,450 --> 00:43:47,589
Buses aren't hours
late, Miss Bleeker.

681
00:43:47,590 --> 00:43:49,453
Outrageous, I know.

682
00:43:49,454 --> 00:43:51,938
What a waste of my time.

683
00:43:51,939 --> 00:43:53,975
But I didn't see the guy
that you're talking about.

684
00:43:53,976 --> 00:43:57,979
So, I'm sorry I don't have
more intel for you detective.

685
00:43:57,980 --> 00:43:59,463
But that's not a crime, is it?

686
00:43:59,464 --> 00:44:01,914
No, it's not, but giving
a false testimony is.

687
00:44:01,915 --> 00:44:03,501
And for some strange reason,

688
00:44:03,502 --> 00:44:06,573
you and your two closest friends
all have murky testimonies

689
00:44:06,574 --> 00:44:08,368
on the day a man was murdered.

690
00:44:08,369 --> 00:44:11,544
Am I being detained, detective?

691
00:44:11,545 --> 00:44:14,306
No, you can go.

692
00:44:15,376 --> 00:44:17,136
But Clare, let me be clear.

693
00:44:17,137 --> 00:44:19,415
You have a three-hour
gap in your alibi.

694
00:44:20,243 --> 00:44:21,589
I will find out why.

695
00:44:24,731 --> 00:44:26,939
Detective Timmons, do you know

696
00:44:26,940 --> 00:44:29,458
how many women have gone
missing in this town

697
00:44:29,459 --> 00:44:31,012
in the last 30 years?

698
00:44:33,049 --> 00:44:34,050
53.

699
00:44:35,362 --> 00:44:38,364
54 with Theresa Holmes.

700
00:44:38,365 --> 00:44:42,092
In a single town in the
course of only three decades,

701
00:44:42,093 --> 00:44:44,025
my brain, just, I-

702
00:44:44,026 --> 00:44:46,061
How does something
like that go unnoticed?

703
00:44:46,062 --> 00:44:48,615
How does so many
women go unnoticed?

704
00:44:48,616 --> 00:44:50,583
Clare, you're being naive,

705
00:44:50,584 --> 00:44:53,206
if you don't think we're
aware, people go missing.

706
00:44:53,207 --> 00:44:54,414
It's what keeps me up at night.

707
00:44:54,415 --> 00:44:55,864
And it's the reason
why I warned you

708
00:44:55,865 --> 00:44:57,211
the first time I saw you.

709
00:44:58,212 --> 00:44:59,557
But something tells me

710
00:44:59,558 --> 00:45:01,732
that you're withholding
pivotal information here.

711
00:45:01,733 --> 00:45:03,596
Unless this guy
has something to do

712
00:45:03,597 --> 00:45:05,219
with these missing girls.

713
00:45:07,290 --> 00:45:08,706
I think my job is done here.

714
00:45:12,226 --> 00:45:15,782
I'm allowed to leave, right?

715
00:45:17,645 --> 00:45:18,646
There's the door.

716
00:45:26,171 --> 00:45:27,793
He can't have anything on me.

717
00:45:27,794 --> 00:45:29,070
He can't. He can't.

718
00:45:29,071 --> 00:45:31,382
Because if he did, he'd
already have me detained

719
00:45:31,383 --> 00:45:33,695
and I didn't leave any
DNA evidence behind

720
00:45:33,696 --> 00:45:34,765
because they had already had me.

721
00:45:34,766 --> 00:45:36,077
Hmm.

722
00:45:36,078 --> 00:45:38,113
How would I bring up
all these missing girls?

723
00:45:38,114 --> 00:45:39,839
Timmons just doesn't
say anything.

724
00:45:39,840 --> 00:45:42,117
He literally didn't
say anything.

725
00:45:42,118 --> 00:45:43,705
It's like, why
doesn't anybody care?

726
00:45:43,706 --> 00:45:46,501
People tend to not want to
talk about that kind of stuff.

727
00:45:46,502 --> 00:45:47,640
What does that mean?

728
00:45:47,641 --> 00:45:49,159
The ugly stuff in the world.

729
00:45:49,160 --> 00:45:50,850
They wanna pretend
it's not there.

730
00:45:50,851 --> 00:45:52,403
Well, what does that mean to me?

731
00:45:52,404 --> 00:45:54,164
Well, like, we should just
go on living our lives

732
00:45:54,165 --> 00:45:55,475
while all these
girls are missing?

733
00:45:55,476 --> 00:45:57,270
Why am I even
talking to you, Bob?

734
00:45:57,271 --> 00:45:58,375
Well technically, you're not.

735
00:45:58,376 --> 00:45:59,583
Timmons,

736
00:45:59,584 --> 00:46:01,240
he's always watching so I
can't really do anything.

737
00:46:01,241 --> 00:46:02,862
But on top of that right,

738
00:46:02,863 --> 00:46:05,692
I'm just jeopardizing
all of my friends.

739
00:46:05,693 --> 00:46:07,591
You don't really have
any friends left, do you?

740
00:46:07,592 --> 00:46:09,938
There's Juliana, there's
Amity, there's something

741
00:46:09,939 --> 00:46:11,768
that's not right about that.

742
00:46:11,769 --> 00:46:13,839
And then you've got Wade, Wade.

743
00:46:13,840 --> 00:46:15,979
He's got this so many photos.

744
00:46:15,980 --> 00:46:18,257
Look at her. How did
they get in his room?

745
00:46:18,258 --> 00:46:19,741
Why does he have them?

746
00:46:19,742 --> 00:46:21,225
I need to figure
out this puzzle.

747
00:46:21,226 --> 00:46:23,952
I need to put all of
the pieces together.

748
00:46:23,953 --> 00:46:24,953
It'll work out.

749
00:46:24,954 --> 00:46:26,472
But, but I can't, I can't.

750
00:46:26,473 --> 00:46:28,923
Because I shouldn't. I
shouldn't be doing this.

751
00:46:28,924 --> 00:46:30,856
I can't be doing this because
I've done too many things

752
00:46:30,857 --> 00:46:33,237
and they're going to resurface
that I've done in the past.

753
00:46:33,238 --> 00:46:34,514
I don't know what to do.

754
00:46:34,515 --> 00:46:36,171
I need to know what to
do. What do I do, Bob?

755
00:46:36,172 --> 00:46:37,898
What do I do? What do I do?

756
00:46:39,175 --> 00:46:41,625
You have to finish
what you started.

757
00:46:41,626 --> 00:46:42,764
I can't. I can't.

758
00:46:42,765 --> 00:46:44,283
-You have to go back.
-I can't.

759
00:46:44,284 --> 00:46:46,734
You have to go back to
the house on Oak Street.

760
00:46:48,115 --> 00:46:49,875
Like Joan of Arc?

761
00:46:49,876 --> 00:46:53,500
Like Joan of Arc, guided
solely by my visions.

762
00:46:54,742 --> 00:46:56,606
Joan burned, Clare.

763
00:49:36,628 --> 00:49:39,009
Something so evil,

764
00:49:39,010 --> 00:49:41,875
it infects all of
those who touch it.

765
00:49:42,876 --> 00:49:47,190
Death trap is a Chinese box

766
00:49:47,191 --> 00:49:50,779
of moving parts that makes
you question everything

767
00:49:50,780 --> 00:49:52,092
that you just learned.

768
00:49:53,266 --> 00:49:56,302
Who is an ally?

769
00:49:56,303 --> 00:49:57,614
Who is not?

770
00:49:57,615 --> 00:50:00,031
Who is a murderer?

771
00:50:01,067 --> 00:50:04,207
And who is a victim?

772
00:50:04,208 --> 00:50:06,795
I'm gonna take this great play

773
00:50:06,796 --> 00:50:12,525
and make it extraordinary
by casting Clare Bleeker

774
00:50:12,526 --> 00:50:14,907
as the male lead, Sidney Brule,

775
00:50:14,908 --> 00:50:16,150
What?

776
00:50:16,151 --> 00:50:21,259
The washed up writer who's
desperate for a second chance.

777
00:50:21,673 --> 00:50:25,642
And Amity Liston will
play Clifford, the young

778
00:50:25,643 --> 00:50:29,508
and plucky student who Sydney
is trying to steal the play

779
00:50:29,509 --> 00:50:30,923
of death trap from.

780
00:50:30,924 --> 00:50:32,269
I'm an ingenue.

781
00:50:32,270 --> 00:50:33,615
Uh-huh.

782
00:50:33,616 --> 00:50:36,549
And Wade, you will be
playing Sydney's wife,

783
00:50:36,550 --> 00:50:39,897
the clingy Machiavellian Myra.

784
00:50:39,898 --> 00:50:42,521
So I get to play
Clare's clingy wife?

785
00:50:42,522 --> 00:50:43,660
Mm-hmm.

786
00:50:43,661 --> 00:50:44,764
Sexy.

787
00:50:44,765 --> 00:50:46,421
What?

788
00:50:46,422 --> 00:50:47,767
Miss Liston.

789
00:50:47,768 --> 00:50:49,079
I just-

790
00:50:49,080 --> 00:50:52,117
Whatever it is you
are channeling here,

791
00:50:52,118 --> 00:50:55,499
I need you to save
it for the stage.

792
00:50:55,500 --> 00:50:56,914
Okay?

793
00:50:56,915 --> 00:50:59,986
Rehearsal time, it's
indeed where this belongs.

794
00:50:59,987 --> 00:51:02,196
Indeed.

795
00:51:02,197 --> 00:51:07,442
Now, donde esta,
mi psychic Helga.

796
00:51:07,443 --> 00:51:08,547
Helga?

797
00:51:08,548 --> 00:51:10,342
Hey. Hey. I'm here. I'm here.

798
00:51:10,343 --> 00:51:11,481
Sorry, I was working on a film-

799
00:51:11,482 --> 00:51:12,930
No, no, no, no.

800
00:51:12,931 --> 00:51:15,278
I do not tolerate tardiness.

801
00:51:15,279 --> 00:51:16,314
Be gone.

802
00:51:18,937 --> 00:51:20,421
Are are, are you
serious right now?

803
00:51:20,422 --> 00:51:21,836
Deadly. Out.

804
00:51:21,837 --> 00:51:23,942
Okay, okay, okay.

805
00:51:25,841 --> 00:51:30,880
And that is what we call acting.

806
00:51:31,709 --> 00:51:32,743
See what I'm doing there, kids?

807
00:51:32,744 --> 00:51:33,917
Helga, Helga, Helga, Helga,

808
00:51:33,918 --> 00:51:35,436
please come back.

809
00:51:35,437 --> 00:51:36,851
We miss you already.

810
00:51:36,852 --> 00:51:38,163
Please take a seat

811
00:51:38,164 --> 00:51:40,544
and use your psychic
abilities to make sure

812
00:51:40,545 --> 00:51:43,927
that you never, ever,
ever disappoint me again.

813
00:51:43,928 --> 00:51:46,103
Or you'll be out like
me from the closet.

814
00:51:47,966 --> 00:51:51,693
I can't wait to get started
so I can watch Helga die

815
00:51:51,694 --> 00:51:55,112
a very slow and
excruciating death.

816
00:51:56,596 --> 00:52:01,427
Wow, Clare here is clearly
overcompensating for her lack

817
00:52:01,428 --> 00:52:06,675
of talent by method
acting, which I Stan.

818
00:52:07,054 --> 00:52:08,089
Okay.

819
00:52:08,090 --> 00:52:09,298
Bravo, Clare.

820
00:52:10,265 --> 00:52:11,265
Bravo.

821
00:52:11,266 --> 00:52:13,682
Now everybody, up, up, up.

822
00:52:14,510 --> 00:52:16,925
Use our instruments people.

823
00:52:16,926 --> 00:52:19,411
A five, six, seven, eight.

824
00:52:19,412 --> 00:52:22,035
To the right, to the left.

825
00:52:22,484 --> 00:52:24,313
To the right, to the left.

826
00:52:24,727 --> 00:52:26,557
To the right, to the left.

827
00:52:27,040 --> 00:52:28,282
To the right.

828
00:52:28,283 --> 00:52:29,559
The tip of the tongue,
the teeth, the lips.

829
00:52:29,560 --> 00:52:32,735
The tip of the tongue,
the teeth, the lips.

830
00:53:08,426 --> 00:53:10,013
Clare.

831
00:53:10,014 --> 00:53:11,222
Clare, what happened?

832
00:53:12,568 --> 00:53:13,672
Clare, what's your problem?

833
00:53:13,673 --> 00:53:14,708
Hey, hey, wait.

834
00:53:17,470 --> 00:53:18,608
Don't come near me.

835
00:53:18,609 --> 00:53:20,093
You're actually insane.

836
00:53:20,921 --> 00:53:23,130
What the fuck? You're
a nut job, fuck.

837
00:53:43,944 --> 00:53:45,946
[Tires squeal]

838
00:54:12,352 --> 00:54:13,352
So?

839
00:54:14,147 --> 00:54:15,665
So what?

840
00:54:15,666 --> 00:54:17,253
So what is our plan?

841
00:54:17,254 --> 00:54:19,738
There is a curfew in place.

842
00:54:19,739 --> 00:54:22,016
That is the plan.

843
00:54:22,017 --> 00:54:23,293
A curfew.

844
00:54:23,294 --> 00:54:24,984
What does a curfew
do in this situation?

845
00:54:24,985 --> 00:54:27,746
It is a necessary precaution,

846
00:54:27,747 --> 00:54:29,782
given the extreme
circumstances that we're in.

847
00:54:29,783 --> 00:54:31,128
The only person right now

848
00:54:31,129 --> 00:54:33,959
who is in extreme
circumstances is Juliana.

849
00:54:33,960 --> 00:54:35,857
If we don't do
something immediately,

850
00:54:35,858 --> 00:54:37,721
she's gonna disappear like
the rest of the girls.

851
00:54:37,722 --> 00:54:39,447
There's gonna be a vigil.

852
00:54:39,448 --> 00:54:41,035
We'll go to the vigil.

853
00:54:41,036 --> 00:54:43,624
What, what does
a vigil do, Gigi?

854
00:54:43,625 --> 00:54:45,729
We should be out
looking right now.

855
00:54:45,730 --> 00:54:47,075
And what is with the coffee?

856
00:54:47,076 --> 00:54:48,318
You don't even drink coffee.

857
00:54:48,319 --> 00:54:52,667
It's to keep me up,
while you sleep.

858
00:54:52,668 --> 00:54:54,497
-Are you serious?
-Yes.

859
00:54:54,498 --> 00:54:56,913
Right now, anything could
be happening to her.

860
00:54:56,914 --> 00:55:00,020
I hear you talking
to yourself at night.

861
00:55:00,952 --> 00:55:03,471
Detective Timmons says I
should take particular care

862
00:55:03,472 --> 00:55:06,992
with you because of your
fragile state of mind.

863
00:55:06,993 --> 00:55:08,821
But is he insinuating
that I'm crazy?

864
00:55:08,822 --> 00:55:10,064
No, it's not like that.

865
00:55:10,065 --> 00:55:12,204
-Is that what you think?
-No, that's not what I think.

866
00:55:12,205 --> 00:55:15,034
But you've been
through a lot, Clare.

867
00:55:15,035 --> 00:55:16,829
You've seen some
horrifying things.

868
00:55:16,830 --> 00:55:20,246
And I know that you
sneak out at night.

869
00:55:20,247 --> 00:55:23,664
To do what I have no
idea, but it has to stop.

870
00:55:23,665 --> 00:55:26,563
From now on, it is
home, school, home.

871
00:55:26,564 --> 00:55:29,118
-Until when?
-Until I say so.

872
00:55:34,469 --> 00:55:36,471
What was this doing
in your drawer?

873
00:55:40,095 --> 00:55:41,716
-Protection.
-Oh, come on.

874
00:55:41,717 --> 00:55:43,201
What is this for?

875
00:55:44,686 --> 00:55:47,723
What is it you do when
you sneak out at night?

876
00:55:54,730 --> 00:55:55,835
Tell me.

877
00:55:58,320 --> 00:55:59,356
I can't tell you.

878
00:56:02,048 --> 00:56:03,221
I can't tell anyone.

879
00:56:05,085 --> 00:56:06,742
Jesus.

880
00:56:11,160 --> 00:56:12,679
You are grounded.

881
00:56:18,305 --> 00:56:19,893
I'm not your child, Gigi.

882
00:56:24,519 --> 00:56:25,934
No, you're not.

883
00:56:27,107 --> 00:56:30,387
Because I had to bury my
child with my own hands.

884
00:56:35,081 --> 00:56:37,255
I'm not gonna bury my
granddaughter also.

885
00:57:02,833 --> 00:57:04,281
Clare!

886
00:57:04,282 --> 00:57:05,491
Oh my God!

887
00:57:18,158 --> 00:57:21,126
Clare, you have to
promise me something.

888
00:57:21,127 --> 00:57:24,163
You'll never tell anyone what
you did in the woods today.

889
00:57:24,164 --> 00:57:25,544
Okay?

890
00:57:25,545 --> 00:57:26,995
Even if you saved a life.

891
00:57:28,686 --> 00:57:29,928
It will haunt you, Clare.

892
00:57:29,929 --> 00:57:32,620
It will change
your life forever.

893
00:57:32,621 --> 00:57:34,658
And not everyone
will understand you.

894
00:57:35,831 --> 00:57:37,799
Not everyone will
see you as a hero.

895
00:57:39,594 --> 00:57:41,665
You have to bear
this secret alone.

896
00:57:44,081 --> 00:57:45,599
But whenever you
feel like you need

897
00:57:45,600 --> 00:57:49,155
to take this burden off your
shoulders, you come talk to me.

898
00:57:50,467 --> 00:57:52,606
I'll always be with you

899
00:57:52,607 --> 00:57:54,297
when all goes dark.

900
00:58:00,304 --> 00:58:01,305
Mom?

901
00:58:06,172 --> 00:58:09,001
Please grant me strength.

902
00:58:09,002 --> 00:58:11,970
Holy Mary, Mother of God,
please grant me strength.

903
00:58:11,971 --> 00:58:13,868
Please do not abandon me.

904
00:58:13,869 --> 00:58:16,181
Holy Mary, Mother
of God, please,

905
00:58:16,182 --> 00:58:17,907
please grant me strength.

906
00:58:17,908 --> 00:58:19,496
Please do not abandon me.

907
00:58:20,807 --> 00:58:22,532
Holy Mary, mother
of God, please,

908
00:58:22,533 --> 00:58:25,190
please grant me strength.

909
00:58:26,951 --> 00:58:29,608
To thee, do we cry
poor children of Eve,

910
00:58:29,609 --> 00:58:34,579
to thee, do we
send up our sighs,

911
00:58:34,580 --> 00:58:37,272
mourning and weeping in
this valley of tears.

912
00:58:38,963 --> 00:58:40,758
Please, Holy Mary mother of God.

913
00:58:43,450 --> 00:58:46,868
The blood, it won't come off.

914
00:58:49,387 --> 00:58:52,010
Help me carry this burden,
I can't do this anymore.

915
00:58:52,011 --> 00:58:54,496
I'm not strong enough.

916
00:58:55,773 --> 00:58:57,016
I belong nowhere.

917
00:58:58,983 --> 00:59:01,192
Show me the way,
make me your vessel.

918
00:59:02,677 --> 00:59:05,472
Please do not abandon me.

919
00:59:09,373 --> 00:59:13,550
Pray for us sinners now and
in the hour of our death.

920
00:59:14,551 --> 00:59:15,552
Amen.

921
00:59:21,592 --> 00:59:22,765
Help me.

922
00:59:48,032 --> 00:59:49,827
Who are you taking
the photos for?

923
00:59:50,656 --> 00:59:54,451
Clare, please don't do
something you may regret.

924
00:59:54,452 --> 00:59:55,970
Who are you taking
the photos for?

925
00:59:55,971 --> 00:59:57,178
Okay, look, I'll answer
whatever question you have,

926
00:59:57,179 --> 00:59:58,386
but you need to
put the knife down.

927
00:59:58,387 --> 00:59:59,491
No.

928
00:59:59,492 --> 01:00:01,389
Who are you taking
the photos for?

929
01:00:01,390 --> 01:00:03,529
I don't know what
you're asking me.

930
01:00:03,530 --> 01:00:05,152
Photo that you took of me
the night of the party.

931
01:00:05,153 --> 01:00:07,119
Why did I find it in
some stranger's basement?

932
01:00:07,120 --> 01:00:08,396
Hmm? What was it doing there?

933
01:00:08,397 --> 01:00:09,915
Who are you selling
these photos to?

934
01:00:09,916 --> 01:00:12,021
-Your, your photo?
-Don't act fucking stupid.

935
01:00:12,022 --> 01:00:13,436
You know what I'm talking about.

936
01:00:13,437 --> 01:00:15,403
Look, my camera was stolen
the night of the party.

937
01:00:15,404 --> 01:00:17,405
Okay? When the cops
came, all right?

938
01:00:17,406 --> 01:00:19,097
All those photos
that I took are gone.

939
01:00:19,098 --> 01:00:20,650
Literally, I didn't get a
chance to download them.

940
01:00:20,651 --> 01:00:21,651
I lost-

941
01:00:21,652 --> 01:00:23,549
-Are you lying to me?
-No. Look,

942
01:00:23,550 --> 01:00:25,966
every single photo I
took that night is gone.

943
01:00:25,967 --> 01:00:27,277
Including yours.

944
01:00:27,278 --> 01:00:29,935
I'm working on film again.

945
01:00:29,936 --> 01:00:32,145
What do you know about
the house on Oak Street?

946
01:00:33,077 --> 01:00:35,009
Who told you? Was
it, was it Wade?

947
01:00:35,010 --> 01:00:36,528
What about Wade?

948
01:00:36,529 --> 01:00:39,255
He thinks I took some
promiscuous photos of his girl

949
01:00:39,256 --> 01:00:41,291
when I didn't even know what
I was walking myself into.

950
01:00:41,292 --> 01:00:43,362
Okay? And I don't even
think Amity did either.

951
01:00:43,363 --> 01:00:45,157
I was just answering some
stupid photography ad,

952
01:00:45,158 --> 01:00:46,227
to make some cash.

953
01:00:46,228 --> 01:00:48,264
Okay? I didn't even
go back. That's it.

954
01:00:48,265 --> 01:00:49,784
Did you take this photo?

955
01:00:51,958 --> 01:00:54,547
No, but I recognized
the background.

956
01:00:55,375 --> 01:00:56,686
That's the house.

957
01:01:35,381 --> 01:01:37,866
Are you friends with
my granddaughter?

958
01:01:42,664 --> 01:01:44,976
Do you know my granddaughter?

959
01:02:12,936 --> 01:02:14,522
Mrs. Newberry, right?

960
01:02:14,523 --> 01:02:16,421
Yeah, we didn't get a chance
to introduce ourselves.

961
01:02:16,422 --> 01:02:17,698
My name is Truman.

962
01:02:17,699 --> 01:02:18,906
You're friends with
my granddaughter?

963
01:02:18,907 --> 01:02:20,356
Oh, yes, yes. I know Clare.

964
01:02:20,357 --> 01:02:21,529
And where is Clare?

965
01:02:21,530 --> 01:02:23,462
I haven't seen her since...

966
01:02:23,463 --> 01:02:24,843
Since what?

967
01:02:24,844 --> 01:02:27,466
She told me she was
with her friends.

968
01:02:27,467 --> 01:02:30,400
She's not home and
she's not here.

969
01:02:30,401 --> 01:02:32,264
So, so where is she?

970
01:02:32,265 --> 01:02:33,818
Where is she?

971
01:02:33,819 --> 01:02:36,544
Where is my granddaughter?

972
01:02:36,545 --> 01:02:38,098
I can't lose her too.

973
01:02:38,099 --> 01:02:39,927
I can't lose her.

974
01:02:39,928 --> 01:02:45,002
I can't lose her too.

975
01:02:49,593 --> 01:02:50,800
Hello?

976
01:02:50,801 --> 01:02:53,424
Have you seen my
friend, Juliana LeBlanc?

977
01:02:54,460 --> 01:02:56,289
She went missing three days ago.

978
01:02:58,498 --> 01:02:59,499
Have you seen her?

979
01:03:01,363 --> 01:03:02,639
I'm sorry kid, I haven't.

980
01:03:02,640 --> 01:03:03,779
Are you sure?

981
01:03:03,780 --> 01:03:05,297
Can you take
another look please?

982
01:03:05,298 --> 01:03:09,371
'Cause I've been searching
all night and I'm so tired.

983
01:03:13,444 --> 01:03:14,790
Can I use your bathroom?

984
01:03:14,791 --> 01:03:16,516
It'll be really
quick, I promise.

985
01:03:25,318 --> 01:03:26,526
Uh,

986
01:03:27,907 --> 01:03:29,667
where is it, your bathroom?

987
01:03:32,360 --> 01:03:33,878
On the left.

988
01:03:33,879 --> 01:03:36,777
And can I get a glass of water?

989
01:03:36,778 --> 01:03:37,986
I'm so thirsty.

990
01:03:39,298 --> 01:03:40,299
Yeah.

991
01:04:56,996 --> 01:04:58,101
Here you go.

992
01:05:18,776 --> 01:05:21,089
Thank you for your hospitality.

993
01:06:15,178 --> 01:06:17,869
Gibbs needs more
product within two days.

994
01:06:17,870 --> 01:06:19,112
Raw stuff.

995
01:06:19,113 --> 01:06:20,217
Younger.

996
01:06:21,563 --> 01:06:23,403
You can't seem to understand
this is a process.

997
01:06:24,981 --> 01:06:26,395
It takes time to
get these girls.

998
01:06:26,396 --> 01:06:28,017
We run a business, Randall,

999
01:06:28,018 --> 01:06:29,432
and you're behind on delivery.

1000
01:06:29,433 --> 01:06:31,089
Either you're in or you're out.

1001
01:06:31,090 --> 01:06:33,126
Well things have
been a bit backed up

1002
01:06:33,127 --> 01:06:36,232
since the Joe situation.

1003
01:06:36,233 --> 01:06:38,338
Gibbs was sorry to hear
about your brother.

1004
01:06:38,339 --> 01:06:42,307
Yeah, well he did all
the pickups, you know,

1005
01:06:42,308 --> 01:06:44,896
and now I'm running
this thing all myself.

1006
01:06:44,897 --> 01:06:46,656
What about the
recruiter we got you?

1007
01:06:46,657 --> 01:06:49,659
Whose idea was that?

1008
01:06:49,660 --> 01:06:50,834
Hold on.

1009
01:06:51,593 --> 01:06:52,870
Hey.

1010
01:06:53,561 --> 01:06:56,150
Whoa, whoa. Oh, hello.

1011
01:06:57,737 --> 01:06:59,152
Hi.

1012
01:06:59,153 --> 01:07:00,360
There she is.

1013
01:07:00,361 --> 01:07:02,534
You're not gonna believe

1014
01:07:02,535 --> 01:07:05,261
what just knocked on my door.

1015
01:07:05,262 --> 01:07:07,332
She showed up looking
for the other one.

1016
01:07:07,333 --> 01:07:09,817
The van will be at
your place in an hour.

1017
01:07:09,818 --> 01:07:11,474
Better have them both on it.

1018
01:07:11,475 --> 01:07:12,510
Hey, the guys are coming.

1019
01:07:12,511 --> 01:07:13,857
I'll send you stuff ASAP.

1020
01:07:15,479 --> 01:07:17,273
All right, listen up.

1021
01:07:17,274 --> 01:07:18,274
Girl in the bed's done.

1022
01:07:18,275 --> 01:07:20,173
All right? She's got
pick up in an hour.

1023
01:07:20,174 --> 01:07:22,209
Meanwhile, I caught another one.

1024
01:07:22,210 --> 01:07:24,901
So she's gonna need some
pictures, she needs video.

1025
01:07:24,902 --> 01:07:26,386
And I'll tell you, if
you get done early,

1026
01:07:26,387 --> 01:07:28,250
you can have some fun with her
before the van picks her up.

1027
01:07:28,251 --> 01:07:30,977
Okay? Have at it, let's go.

1028
01:07:36,017 --> 01:07:38,053
Hey, take the braids out.

1029
01:07:38,054 --> 01:07:39,055
Little messy.

1030
01:07:41,885 --> 01:07:42,886
There you go.

1031
01:07:44,232 --> 01:07:46,165
Yeah. All right. Clear out.

1032
01:07:47,856 --> 01:07:50,031
There we go. There we go.

1033
01:07:54,346 --> 01:07:55,346
Oh, it's good.

1034
01:07:56,382 --> 01:07:58,901
Randall, can I get
her for the video?

1035
01:07:58,902 --> 01:08:00,766
All right. Hey, I'm done.

1036
01:08:01,801 --> 01:08:04,389
Okey dokes. Bring her on.

1037
01:08:04,390 --> 01:08:05,426
Showtime.

1038
01:08:06,703 --> 01:08:07,980
Hang on a second.

1039
01:08:08,774 --> 01:08:09,878
I'm getting a vision.

1040
01:08:11,017 --> 01:08:13,122
You two look good together.

1041
01:08:13,123 --> 01:08:14,883
Why don't we spice
up this video?

1042
01:08:15,919 --> 01:08:18,507
Maybe introduce some product
testing to the package

1043
01:08:18,508 --> 01:08:21,648
and get a bidding war going on.

1044
01:08:21,649 --> 01:08:23,305
Put on a mask and
get camera ready.

1045
01:08:23,306 --> 01:08:24,823
I ain't getting paid
enough for this shit, man.

1046
01:08:24,824 --> 01:08:27,826
-I'll do it.
-Yes! Yes!

1047
01:08:27,827 --> 01:08:29,069
What's wrong with you, Justin?

1048
01:08:29,070 --> 01:08:30,485
Jesus Christ.

1049
01:08:32,418 --> 01:08:34,488
Hey, Randall. How much
did you give her, man?

1050
01:08:34,489 --> 01:08:35,904
She can't even
stand up straight.

1051
01:08:37,043 --> 01:08:38,597
I can't pick up the girl.

1052
01:08:39,322 --> 01:08:41,116
You want me to reset
the lights by the bed?

1053
01:08:41,117 --> 01:08:42,876
No, just pull the horse over.

1054
01:08:42,877 --> 01:08:44,120
Let's go.

1055
01:08:46,467 --> 01:08:50,504
Everything I've said and done
has been the will of God.

1056
01:08:50,505 --> 01:08:52,645
What? What did you say?

1057
01:08:53,474 --> 01:08:54,958
I am not afraid.

1058
01:08:57,098 --> 01:08:58,444
I'm not afraid.

1059
01:08:59,376 --> 01:09:01,584
I was born to do this.

1060
01:09:01,585 --> 01:09:04,761
Hey Randall, I don't
like this, man.

1061
01:09:06,072 --> 01:09:07,901
You are so high.

1062
01:09:07,902 --> 01:09:09,799
Everything I have said and done

1063
01:09:09,800 --> 01:09:12,319
has been in the hands of God.

1064
01:09:12,320 --> 01:09:15,565
I was born to do
this, I'm not afraid.

1065
01:10:03,475 --> 01:10:04,786
Come on you-

1066
01:10:06,926 --> 01:10:08,133
Let her go.

1067
01:10:08,134 --> 01:10:09,411
Why should I?

1068
01:10:09,412 --> 01:10:11,309
I won't have mercy on
your soul if you don't.

1069
01:10:11,310 --> 01:10:15,072
On my soul?

1070
01:10:16,073 --> 01:10:17,212
Let her go.

1071
01:10:21,320 --> 01:10:23,597
Help! Help!

1072
01:10:23,598 --> 01:10:24,909
We're down here.

1073
01:10:24,910 --> 01:10:26,325
Oh!

1074
01:10:26,498 --> 01:10:29,016
Help, help us, please.

1075
01:10:29,017 --> 01:10:30,673
We're down here.
Please help us.

1076
01:10:30,674 --> 01:10:31,881
I'm so scared.

1077
01:10:31,882 --> 01:10:34,850
Please, please, please,
someone help me.

1078
01:10:48,347 --> 01:10:49,866
Oh, shit.

1079
01:10:51,074 --> 01:10:52,869
What the fuck happened here?

1080
01:10:53,801 --> 01:10:55,491
Randall, Jesus Christ, man.

1081
01:10:55,492 --> 01:10:56,975
You had one job.

1082
01:10:56,976 --> 01:10:58,357
You fuckin' piece of shit.

1083
01:10:59,807 --> 01:11:00,807
Clare.

1084
01:11:04,570 --> 01:11:07,054
All right, let's try to
all walk outta here alive.

1085
01:11:07,055 --> 01:11:08,090
Shall we?

1086
01:11:08,091 --> 01:11:09,403
Tell him to let her go.

1087
01:11:10,507 --> 01:11:11,507
Do it!

1088
01:11:12,198 --> 01:11:13,199
Go on.

1089
01:11:15,512 --> 01:11:18,170
Put the scissors on the
floor and pass them to me.

1090
01:11:30,389 --> 01:11:31,769
That was fair.

1091
01:11:31,770 --> 01:11:33,564
And I'd say we're
even now, don't you?

1092
01:11:33,565 --> 01:11:36,015
Where do all the
girls go, Timmons?

1093
01:11:36,809 --> 01:11:37,810
Hmm?

1094
01:11:38,984 --> 01:11:40,779
How much do they go for?

1095
01:11:51,514 --> 01:11:54,067
By the way, I loved
killing your brother.

1096
01:12:00,488 --> 01:12:02,386
I have to go get Timmons.

1097
01:12:02,387 --> 01:12:04,457
Clare, please, please,
please, don't leave me.

1098
01:12:04,458 --> 01:12:05,561
I have to.

1099
01:12:05,562 --> 01:12:07,183
Please, don't leave me, please.

1100
01:12:07,184 --> 01:12:08,219
Fuck.

1101
01:12:11,154 --> 01:12:12,880
There, there, there, there.

1102
01:12:20,232 --> 01:12:23,097
You're safe, you're safe.
You're safe, you're safe.

1103
01:12:24,029 --> 01:12:27,412
No one's gonna hurt
you. I promise.

1104
01:12:29,275 --> 01:12:31,692
Hey, hey, hey, you're safe.

1105
01:13:25,815 --> 01:13:26,816
Gigi.

1106
01:13:28,645 --> 01:13:29,645
Gigi,

1107
01:13:31,337 --> 01:13:33,477
I know you're mad and I'm sorry

1108
01:13:33,478 --> 01:13:36,997
but you're never gonna
believe what happened.

1109
01:13:36,998 --> 01:13:38,482
You have to see what's on TV.

1110
01:13:38,483 --> 01:13:41,139
...versity town has been
discovered to be the nest,

1111
01:13:41,140 --> 01:13:42,555
of a human trafficking
We found Juliana!

1112
01:13:42,556 --> 01:13:44,004
Operation that has run

1113
01:13:44,005 --> 01:13:46,282
for more than 40 years.

1114
01:13:46,283 --> 01:13:48,768
A local college
student, Juliana LeBlanc

1115
01:13:48,769 --> 01:13:52,599
who went missing three
days ago, was found alive

1116
01:13:52,600 --> 01:13:54,290
inside the basement

1117
01:13:54,291 --> 01:13:57,086
of trafficking ring
leader, Randall Morton.

1118
01:13:57,087 --> 01:13:59,364
Mr. Morton and his brother Joe,

1119
01:13:59,365 --> 01:14:03,438
had previously been convicted
with bail years prior.

1120
01:14:03,439 --> 01:14:05,301
When another student
came to this house

1121
01:14:05,302 --> 01:14:06,820
looking for her friend,

1122
01:14:06,821 --> 01:14:09,271
she walked into the scene
of a gruesome death,

1123
01:14:09,272 --> 01:14:10,686
-Gigi!
-that miraculously,

1124
01:14:10,687 --> 01:14:13,102
-You're missing it.
-Juliana was spared from.

1125
01:14:13,103 --> 01:14:14,311
What happened?

1126
01:14:15,347 --> 01:14:17,867
It, it was really scary.

1127
01:14:18,212 --> 01:14:19,524
I...

1128
01:14:20,386 --> 01:14:21,904
The door was open

1129
01:14:21,905 --> 01:14:25,287
and then I could hear yelling
coming from the basement.

1130
01:14:25,288 --> 01:14:27,323
And then I went in and then

1131
01:14:27,324 --> 01:14:29,118
I was like walking-

1132
01:14:29,119 --> 01:14:32,432
It took such courage
for this young lady to

1133
01:14:32,433 --> 01:14:34,469
walk into the wolf's mouth.

1134
01:14:34,470 --> 01:14:37,713
But her action saved
her best friend's life.

1135
01:14:37,714 --> 01:14:39,232
Stay tuned for more information

1136
01:14:39,233 --> 01:14:41,096
on the Pickmann Flats
trafficking case.

1137
01:14:41,097 --> 01:14:43,132
We'll be right back
after a short break.

1138
01:15:16,408 --> 01:15:19,203
Oh, don't worry, Clare.

1139
01:15:19,204 --> 01:15:21,517
She got to die peacefully
in her own home.

1140
01:15:23,311 --> 01:15:25,589
Well, not too peacefully
since she had a heart attack

1141
01:15:25,590 --> 01:15:27,661
the second she realized
I was after you.

1142
01:15:28,938 --> 01:15:30,352
Remember, I tried to
make a deal with you,

1143
01:15:30,353 --> 01:15:32,666
but you had to go all
Rambo in that basement.

1144
01:15:34,495 --> 01:15:36,807
You could have spared
your grandmother's life.

1145
01:15:36,808 --> 01:15:39,741
All they do is take from me.

1146
01:15:39,742 --> 01:15:40,811
They take from me.

1147
01:15:40,812 --> 01:15:42,537
What? What? What
are you saying?

1148
01:15:42,538 --> 01:15:43,883
I cannot hear you.

1149
01:15:43,884 --> 01:15:46,714
The last thing I have is...

1150
01:15:49,441 --> 01:15:50,717
...gone.

1151
01:15:50,718 --> 01:15:53,272
I have nothing.
I have nothing.

1152
01:15:56,034 --> 01:15:57,931
Are you here to kill me now?

1153
01:16:00,348 --> 01:16:02,765
Clare, I think there's
been a misunderstanding.

1154
01:16:03,904 --> 01:16:05,663
I'm not here to kill you.

1155
01:16:05,664 --> 01:16:07,493
I don't want you dead at all.

1156
01:16:08,840 --> 01:16:10,944
I want you to work for me.

1157
01:16:10,945 --> 01:16:12,395
No, with, with me.

1158
01:16:13,327 --> 01:16:14,845
See, as you rightfully
pointed out,

1159
01:16:14,846 --> 01:16:17,054
you have nothing to live for.

1160
01:16:17,055 --> 01:16:21,852
No family members left,
but you are a weapon.

1161
01:16:21,853 --> 01:16:25,165
Oh my God, Clare, we could
make so much money together.

1162
01:16:25,166 --> 01:16:27,203
I'm telling you,
you'd be set for life.

1163
01:16:28,135 --> 01:16:29,481
Ah.

1164
01:16:31,138 --> 01:16:32,898
I would never.

1165
01:16:33,519 --> 01:16:34,485
Never.

1166
01:16:34,486 --> 01:16:37,869
I expected a little resistance.

1167
01:16:39,595 --> 01:16:42,251
See, I've done some research
on you, Miss Bleeker.

1168
01:16:42,252 --> 01:16:45,082
Your father left when
you were in fifth grade.

1169
01:16:45,083 --> 01:16:48,604
Mom had a rare heart condition
that went undiagnosed.

1170
01:16:49,708 --> 01:16:51,607
She died when you were only 14.

1171
01:16:53,160 --> 01:16:57,164
After that, you moved from
New York to Connecticut,

1172
01:16:58,337 --> 01:17:00,062
from friends' houses
to boarding schools

1173
01:17:00,063 --> 01:17:01,789
until you ended up here.

1174
01:17:02,479 --> 01:17:04,481
But it appears that
wherever you went,

1175
01:17:05,655 --> 01:17:07,898
somehow a mysterious
surge in murder cases

1176
01:17:07,899 --> 01:17:10,763
made to look like suicides
or accidents happened.

1177
01:17:10,764 --> 01:17:13,179
I know you killed Joe Morton.

1178
01:17:13,180 --> 01:17:15,871
I know you're responsible
for the mailman's death

1179
01:17:15,872 --> 01:17:18,149
and virtually every
other unsolved murder

1180
01:17:18,150 --> 01:17:20,289
in the cities you've lived in.

1181
01:17:20,290 --> 01:17:22,602
Join me, Clare.

1182
01:17:22,603 --> 01:17:25,192
Or it's only a matter of
time until you get caught.

1183
01:17:26,227 --> 01:17:27,952
I can protect you.

1184
01:17:27,953 --> 01:17:28,954
Detective...

1185
01:17:30,542 --> 01:17:32,544
I believe in what I do.

1186
01:17:33,994 --> 01:17:35,720
I hope I get caught.

1187
01:17:50,562 --> 01:17:51,701
Hey!

1188
01:18:06,129 --> 01:18:07,578
You had your chance.

1189
01:18:50,829 --> 01:18:55,040
What has to give light
must endure burning.

1190
01:18:59,389 --> 01:19:03,359
What has to fight must
endure destruction.

1191
01:19:06,224 --> 01:19:07,225
Burn.

1192
01:20:57,197 --> 01:20:59,715
Cheryl, you made it.

1193
01:20:59,716 --> 01:21:01,511
Thank you for coming.
Are you loving?

1194
01:21:02,064 --> 01:21:05,170
-It's great, man.
-I know I'm, phenomenal.

1195
01:21:06,516 --> 01:21:07,931
Pumpkin.

1196
01:21:07,932 --> 01:21:10,002
-Hi, Cole.
-We're so glad you made it

1197
01:21:10,003 --> 01:21:11,520
and that you're doing all right?

1198
01:21:11,521 --> 01:21:12,659
Yes, of course.

1199
01:21:12,660 --> 01:21:14,109
Front row, honey.

1200
01:21:14,110 --> 01:21:16,663
Where you belong.
-Yeah.

1201
01:21:16,664 --> 01:21:19,080
I'm watching you two, trouble.

1202
01:21:22,118 --> 01:21:24,533
Hey, pull it together people.

1203
01:21:24,534 --> 01:21:26,087
Oh my God, oh my God.

1204
01:21:26,088 --> 01:21:28,710
Oh my God, you! I can't!

1205
01:21:28,711 --> 01:21:31,264
Okay. There are reviewers
here for Christ's sake.

1206
01:21:31,265 --> 01:21:32,369
Do you have my tape measure?

1207
01:21:32,370 --> 01:21:34,405
Ah, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

1208
01:21:34,406 --> 01:21:36,269
-Okay.
-Amity, Amity.

1209
01:21:36,270 --> 01:21:38,513
Can you stand still please?

1210
01:21:38,514 --> 01:21:40,791
-Yes.
-This fit you fine last week.

1211
01:21:40,792 --> 01:21:42,862
Maybe I'm losing weight.

1212
01:21:42,863 --> 01:21:44,208
Not in the trunk.

1213
01:21:44,209 --> 01:21:45,245
Ah!

1214
01:21:46,073 --> 01:21:48,212
Okay, Do I look
manly enough for you?

1215
01:21:48,213 --> 01:21:49,455
No.

1216
01:21:49,456 --> 01:21:51,767
Ah, Clifford's ready, we
open in five. Let's go!

1217
01:21:51,768 --> 01:21:54,529
Five! We can't be
late. Move it. Move it.

1218
01:21:54,530 --> 01:21:56,807
Props, props, props.

1219
01:21:56,808 --> 01:21:59,292
Please stop me from putting
this in someone's face.

1220
01:21:59,293 --> 01:22:00,742
You, perfection.

1221
01:22:00,743 --> 01:22:03,952
Yes. I love it. Meow. Meow.

1222
01:22:03,953 --> 01:22:05,989
Come on, OMG.

1223
01:22:05,990 --> 01:22:07,438
There are reviewers here.

1224
01:22:07,439 --> 01:22:09,199
They are totally judging me.

1225
01:22:09,200 --> 01:22:10,442
We are going to hell.

1226
01:22:10,856 --> 01:22:12,030
Curtain!

1227
01:22:12,686 --> 01:22:15,482
Oh my God, I am like
bringing down the house.

1228
01:22:22,006 --> 01:22:26,285
Forever.

1229
01:22:26,286 --> 01:22:28,390
Forever and ever.

1230
01:22:28,391 --> 01:22:29,806
Forever, no.

1231
01:22:42,888 --> 01:22:46,063
Here, why don't you
take some of my flowers?

1232
01:22:46,064 --> 01:22:47,824
I have like way too many.

1233
01:22:52,588 --> 01:22:55,038
Look at Wade.

1234
01:22:55,039 --> 01:22:57,662
At least we don't need
him to finish the play.

1235
01:22:58,974 --> 01:23:00,044
But we do need you.

1236
01:23:01,528 --> 01:23:02,736
So, hurry up.

1237
01:23:04,393 --> 01:23:05,739
It's opening night.

1238
01:23:10,502 --> 01:23:14,368
Hey, break a leg, Clare.

1239
01:23:34,595 --> 01:23:35,665
Good luck.

1240
01:23:36,977 --> 01:23:37,977
Thank you.

1241
01:23:55,202 --> 01:23:56,341
Hi, Clare.

1242
01:23:59,758 --> 01:24:01,104
Where have you been
this entire time?

1243
01:24:01,105 --> 01:24:03,072
I could have used
your help, you know?

1244
01:24:04,349 --> 01:24:05,695
Gigi's dead.

1245
01:24:08,043 --> 01:24:09,044
I know,

1246
01:24:11,287 --> 01:24:13,668
but she's, she's here.

1247
01:24:13,669 --> 01:24:16,430
She's, she's watching over you.

1248
01:24:18,570 --> 01:24:22,954
And she wants you to know
she's very proud of you

1249
01:24:25,301 --> 01:24:26,785
and so are your parents.

1250
01:24:29,340 --> 01:24:33,550
But there is one last thing

1251
01:24:33,551 --> 01:24:38,521
that you have to do and
you can only do it now

1252
01:24:40,420 --> 01:24:41,558
We're about to go.

1253
01:24:41,559 --> 01:24:43,422
This is pretty
disastrous timing, Bob.

1254
01:24:43,423 --> 01:24:46,633
The Tale of Oak
Street isn't over.

1255
01:24:48,186 --> 01:24:49,186
What?

1256
01:24:50,671 --> 01:24:53,812
The code is 1713.

1257
01:24:55,366 --> 01:24:57,160
Code for what?

1258
01:25:20,149 --> 01:25:22,392
Gibbs needs more
product within two days.

1259
01:25:22,393 --> 01:25:24,533
Raw stuff. Younger.

1260
01:25:27,156 --> 01:25:29,124
What about the
recruiter we got you?

1261
01:25:37,201 --> 01:25:39,133
He thinks I took some
promiscuous photos

1262
01:25:39,134 --> 01:25:40,617
of his girlfriend.

1263
01:25:40,618 --> 01:25:42,239
Juliana thinks I'm not smart,

1264
01:25:42,240 --> 01:25:45,242
but I always get the
last laugh in the end.

1265
01:25:45,243 --> 01:25:46,899
Remember that, Clare.

1266
01:26:55,244 --> 01:26:56,901
Break a leg.

1267
01:27:26,758 --> 01:27:28,897
Everything I have said and done

1268
01:27:28,898 --> 01:27:30,692
has been in the hands of God.
