Yeah.
That's dirty hard.

12
00:06:16,544 --> 00:06:18,012
Why is there a wall?

13
00:06:18,112 --> 00:06:19,513
It's, er, two apartments.

Section Papa 1-0,

57
00:12:04,758 --> 00:12:07,127
It's good now.
Still intermittent.

58

Cool.

59
00:12:12,233 --> 00:12:16,870
Got eyes on the north-west
corner of building four.

60
00:12:18,272 --> 00:12:20,374
Is that white Hilux
still there?

61

No, the Hilux pulled out,

65
00:12:33,354 --> 00:12:35,624

went missing off the base.

76
00:13:14,596 --> 00:13:16,665
If you see somebody out there
wearing it, let me know.

77
00:13:18,966 --> 00:13:20,901
Don't shoot 'em,
either. I want it back.

78
00:13:21,001 --> 00:13:23,037
Yeah, I'll try.

79
00:13:38,753 --> 00:13:42,222
We should check that run of
buildings to the West again.

80
00:13:42,323 --> 00:13:44,491
I mean, you could step right
across those rooftops

81

-if you wanted.
-Yeah.

82
00:13:45,727 --> 00:13:47,928

Going well.

88
00:14:17,826 --> 00:14:19,326
Okay.

89
00:14:24,932 --> 00:14:26,835
-That's that new guy energy.
-Mmm-hmm.

90
00:14:29,370 --> 00:14:31,305
How is it down there?

91
00:14:31,405 --> 00:14:33,742
Cigarettes and tea.
You want tea?

92
00:14:33,842 --> 00:14:35,976
No, I'll pass.

93
00:14:36,877 --> 00:14:38,212

95
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:42,416
Corners

97

-White T-shirt?
-Mmm-hmm.

Alpha Two, this is One.

101
00:18:28,375 --> 00:18:30,778

to move on our position.

<i>Why didn't you use a charge?</i>

106
00:18:38,185 --> 00:18:40,755
I didn't wanna make a noise.

<i>Not sure</i>
<i>that worked out for you.</i>

119
00:19:10,417 --> 00:19:11,719
He's disappeared to the west.

120
00:19:11,819 --> 00:19:14,488

around that corner? Over.

121

or suspicious activity

125
00:19:28,102 --> 00:19:29,837

That's the fourth fucking time
he's done that.

134
00:20:03,071 --> 00:20:04,639
Is he peeking or probing?

135
00:20:06,574 --> 00:20:08,843
Peeking with serious intent
to probe.

136
00:20:10,343 --> 00:20:12,412

let this guy do this?

137

-I'm on it.
-What's up?

To kill you.

Last man!

359
00:36:04,132 --> 00:36:05,432
I got the window.

360

-Copy, Bushmaster.
-Okay. Go, go.

366
00:36:20,715 --> 00:36:23,151
Alpha Two, we're preparing

Here's the breakout plan.

Yes, sir.

372
00:36:37,464 --> 00:36:39,734
When the tank rolls up, Frank,
you're gonna pop smoke.

373
00:36:39,834 --> 00:36:42,003
-Check.
-Scouts are gonna lead us out.

374
00:36:42,103 --> 00:36:45,305
It's gonna be Tommy,
Elliott, Sam.

375
00:36:45,405 --> 00:36:46,874
And I'm bringing up the rear.

376
00:36:46,974 --> 00:36:48,408
Ray, you're with me.

377
00:36:48,509 --> 00:36:49,744
Once Elliott is in the tank,

378
00:36:49,844 --> 00:36:52,312
we are all coming back
inside the building.

379
00:36:53,047 --> 00:36:54,916

Alpha Two, when the tank rolls
up, we're gonna break out.

Once we get Elliott evacuated,

396
00:37:38,092 --> 00:37:40,027
we're pulling back
to our house.

397
00:37:40,128 --> 00:37:42,029
Break.

398

-What? Why?

399
00:37:44,966 --> 00:37:47,935
-Sir, why? What is planned?
-We need to cover this door.

400
00:37:48,035 --> 00:37:49,170
Anything we can do

401
00:37:49,269 --> 00:37:51,438

402

We have taken
massive casualties.

564
00:52:00,655 --> 00:52:03,190
We're anticipating coordinated
enemy attack

565

at our position at any moment.

566
00:52:05,359 --> 00:52:08,362
We need you to collapse to us.
Time, now!

567
00:52:10,330 --> 00:52:14,702

Hang on. Hang on.

Come on.

598

All right. You're gonna
feel a little bit of pressure.

599
00:54:54,028 --> 00:54:56,030
Oh, no.

600
00:55:59,293 --> 00:56:02,797
I got you. Sit down.
Hey, you need to sit down.

601
00:56:06,433 --> 00:56:08,368
Get the fuck down!
Get the fuck down!

602

Stay in the room!

603
00:56:17,278 --> 00:56:19,347
It's coming over your boot

All right. Just hold on.

605

Oh, man,
that's not gonna work, okay.

608

Here's what
we're gonna do, all right.

Sir?

610
00:56:33,160 --> 00:56:35,029
- Yeah?
- Apply pressure.

611

Like this, down.

Be advised an IED caused
the injuries. Over.

Okay, all right.
Okay.

625

We can't do gun runs

642

because the bad guys
are right on top of us.

643
00:58:00,114 --> 00:58:01,649
But we can coordinate
a show of force.

644

We need to get these guys

01:08:38,886 --> 01:08:39,887
Have you called for cas-evac?

838
01:08:40,855 --> 01:08:42,122
I can't punch out from here.

839
01:08:43,057 --> 01:08:44,525

01:08:59,373 --> 01:09:01,308
Hey, take a knee,

-What calls have been made?
-Dude...

853
01:09:24,264 --> 01:09:25,499

01:09:36,811 --> 01:09:39,814
We've probably got, probably

Go.

Hit in both of his legs
and hit in his arm.

865
01:09:59,100 --> 01:10:00,101
And he's got abdomen wounds,

866
01:10:00,200 --> 01:10:01,201
and, man,
he's lost a lot of blood.

867
01:10:01,301 --> 01:10:02,570
-Okay.
-And, uh,

868
01:10:02,670 --> 01:10:04,304
there's something burning
inside of him.

869
01:10:04,404 --> 01:10:05,740
Yeah,

Hmm.

You guys hit me
with that fucking morphine?

875

Yeah, I gave you the morphine.
I gave you the morphine, man.

- A few minutes ago.

877

Right before you got here.

878
01:10:21,589 --> 01:10:22,690
Did you do it
in my arm?

879
01:10:22,790 --> 01:10:25,526
'Cause I got shitty blood
return in my legs.

880
01:10:25,626 --> 01:10:26,928
I did it in your arm, man.

881
01:10:27,028 --> 01:10:28,395

Come on!

890
01:10:46,948 --> 01:10:48,248
Don't fuck with him!

891
01:10:51,119 --> 01:10:52,954
Stay in there, Sam,

What the fuck?

933
01:12:53,941 --> 01:12:57,078
Because the last tanks
got fucked up.

934

So they won't send a cas-evac

gives the thumbs up.

936

-There's no other way, man.

1041
01:18:25,072 --> 01:18:26,207
-No, don't fucking touch me.
-We gotta do it.

1042
01:18:26,307 --> 01:18:28,442
-Don't fucking touch...
-BTF-up, bro!

1043
01:18:29,944 --> 01:18:31,946
What side
are we getting Elliott out?

1044
01:18:32,046 --> 01:18:34,114
Elliott...

1045
01:18:34,782 --> 01:18:35,950
Inbound!

1046
01:18:44,391 --> 01:18:46,561
Elliott right side,
Sam on the left side.

1047
01:18:46,661 --> 01:18:47,962
Elliott right. Roger that.

1048
01:18:48,062 --> 01:18:49,930
- One minute out!
- One minute!

1049
01:18:52,466 --> 01:18:53,901
Tommy, I got Elliott.

1050
01:18:54,001 --> 01:18:56,638
Tommy, Frank,
you two are breaking us out.

1051
01:18:56,737 --> 01:18:58,005
-Check.
-Yes, sir.

1052
01:18:58,105 --> 01:18:59,907
Gunners, you'll set up
security out on the street.

1053
01:19:02,876 --> 01:19:03,978
Frank, you straight?

1054
01:19:04,078 --> 01:19:05,446
I'm good.
I'm gonna buttonhook right.

1055
01:19:05,547 --> 01:19:08,015
Copy that.
I'm taking the right Bradley.

1056
01:19:08,115 --> 01:19:10,017
<i>Frogman,</i>
<i>this is Bushmaster.</i>

1057
01:19:10,117 --> 01:19:12,319
<i>We are approaching OP-1</i>
<i>at this time.</i>

1058
01:19:16,490 --> 01:19:17,958
Frank, Tommy.

1059
01:19:18,058 --> 01:19:19,093
-We good?
-Good to go.

1060
01:19:19,193 --> 01:19:20,394
When we break out
of here, eyes on me

1061
01:19:20,494 --> 01:19:22,029
- and only me, all right?
- Ray, Brock,

1062
01:19:22,129 --> 01:19:23,665
-you good?
-We're good!

1063
01:19:23,764 --> 01:19:25,099
Bradleys are here!

1064
01:19:29,003 --> 01:19:31,706
All right.
Let's get him on three.

1065
01:19:31,805 --> 01:19:34,108
- Three, two, one.
- Two, one.

1066
01:19:35,175 --> 01:19:36,910
Ramp down, ramp down,
ramp down, ramp down.

1067
01:19:37,011 --> 01:19:38,946
- Breakout, breakout, breakout!
- Go!

1068
01:19:40,147 --> 01:19:41,650
- Watch his legs.
- Let's go!

1069
01:19:41,750 --> 01:19:43,317
I'm stuck.

1070
01:19:43,417 --> 01:19:44,351
Right, Brock, let's move.

1071
01:19:44,451 --> 01:19:46,554
One, two, three, up!

1072
01:19:46,655 --> 01:19:48,155
Move!

1073
01:19:52,560 --> 01:19:54,562
- Move!
- Right side! Right side!

1074
01:20:00,968 --> 01:20:02,570
Move! Move!

1075
01:20:03,871 --> 01:20:07,441
All right. One! Two! Three!

1076
01:20:12,880 --> 01:20:14,214
- I'm out!
- Come on, brother, we got you!

1077
01:20:14,315 --> 01:20:16,250
Let's go! Let's go!

1078
01:20:19,053 --> 01:20:21,255
- Let's go.
- Move, move! Come on.

1079
01:20:22,289 --> 01:20:23,290
Changing!

1080
01:20:27,696 --> 01:20:29,229
Go, go, go, go, go!

1081
01:20:30,665 --> 01:20:32,600
AJ, 1 o'clock!

1082
01:20:40,974 --> 01:20:42,343
Fucking good!

1083
01:20:42,443 --> 01:20:44,411
- Three o'clock!
- Ramp up!

1084
01:20:48,215 --> 01:20:49,983
- Collapse!
- Collapse!

1085
01:20:51,018 --> 01:20:52,821
- Ramp up! Ramp up!
- Collapse!

1086
01:20:52,920 --> 01:20:55,923
Mac! Mac!

1087
01:20:58,593 --> 01:20:59,627
We have to collapse.

1088
01:20:59,728 --> 01:21:00,662
-Let's go.
-Wait, wait!

1089
01:21:00,762 --> 01:21:02,530
To the house.

1090
01:21:02,630 --> 01:21:03,897
You all right?

1091
01:21:03,997 --> 01:21:05,032
- You all right?
- Yeah. Yeah.

1092
01:21:05,132 --> 01:21:06,367
I just...

1093
01:21:06,467 --> 01:21:07,434
Thought you were hit.

1094
01:21:07,535 --> 01:21:08,536
I just tripped.

1095
01:21:09,738 --> 01:21:11,372
Let's go, let's go!

1096
01:21:11,472 --> 01:21:12,940
Last man! Last man!

1097
01:21:17,579 --> 01:21:18,813
Hey, come on, man, giddy-up.

1098
01:21:18,912 --> 01:21:19,980
I didn't make it out.

1099
01:21:20,080 --> 01:21:21,583
I'm stuck in the Bradley.
Over.

1100
01:21:52,146 --> 01:21:53,882
<i>Redman 0-8,</i>
<i>this is Profane.</i>

1101
01:21:53,981 --> 01:21:55,182
<i>We're seeing</i>
<i>activity converging</i>

1102
01:21:55,282 --> 01:21:58,185
<i>on the rooftops</i>
<i>on all sides of OP-1.</i>

1103
01:21:58,285 --> 01:22:01,221
<i>We need you to de-conflict</i>
<i>any friendlies.</i>

1104
01:22:01,321 --> 01:22:03,223
Profane says the guys
are moving to our roof.

1105
01:22:03,323 --> 01:22:05,760
They're telling us to get our
guys off the roof right now.

1106
01:22:05,860 --> 01:22:07,394
Do we still have guys
up there?

1107
01:22:07,494 --> 01:22:09,496
- We're the last guys up there.
- They're right on us.

1108
01:22:11,633 --> 01:22:15,135
Zawi, you hold security
and lock it down.

1109
01:22:15,502 --> 01:22:16,303
Check.

1110
01:22:16,403 --> 01:22:18,071
Listen up! I'm gonna
have the Bradleys

1111
01:22:18,172 --> 01:22:20,240
take out the second floor
of this building!

1112
01:22:20,340 --> 01:22:22,142
Gunners, you're holding
security out on the street

1113
01:22:22,242 --> 01:22:23,511
- for extract.
- Yes, sir!

1114
01:22:23,611 --> 01:22:26,781
Mac, I want a show of force
for when that happens.

1115
01:22:26,881 --> 01:22:28,348
- Yes, sir. Sergeant.
- Yeah.

1116
01:22:28,883 --> 01:22:30,050
Bushmaster 1-1.

1117
01:22:30,150 --> 01:22:32,119
Need you to fire into
top deck of our building.

1118
01:22:32,219 --> 01:22:35,489
We have enemy on our building
and all surrounding buildings.

1119
01:22:35,590 --> 01:22:38,192
<i>Say again.</i>
<i>Fire into your building?</i>

1120
01:22:38,860 --> 01:22:39,894
We got a full head count.

1121
01:22:40,027 --> 01:22:42,597
Fire into our building.
Top deck.

1122
01:22:42,697 --> 01:22:45,265
Zawi, get the fuck down here!

1123
01:22:45,365 --> 01:22:47,167
<i>Negative, Frogman.</i>
<i>We can't do that.</i>

1124
01:22:47,267 --> 01:22:50,070
The top deck is fucking clear.
Fire into it.

1125
01:22:56,578 --> 01:22:58,345
<i>Roger that. Stand by.</i>

1126
01:22:58,445 --> 01:22:59,848
<i>-Going hot.</i>
<i>-</i> Suck in!

1127
01:22:59,948 --> 01:23:01,215
- Find cover!
- Let's go!

1128
01:23:03,651 --> 01:23:05,587
Get down! Get down! Get down!

1129
01:23:45,627 --> 01:23:46,861
We're breaking out hot!

1130
01:23:46,961 --> 01:23:48,630
- Gunners up!
- Let's move!

1131
01:23:48,730 --> 01:23:50,030
Gunners up!

1132
01:23:51,331 --> 01:23:52,332
<i>Frogman, Bushmaster.</i>

1133
01:23:52,432 --> 01:23:53,801
<i>Shifting fire, going hot.</i>

1134
01:24:09,116 --> 01:24:10,518
Why?

1135
01:24:10,618 --> 01:24:12,252
- Why? Why?
- I'm sorry.

1136
01:24:12,352 --> 01:24:13,721
-I'm sorry.
-Why?

1137
01:24:17,992 --> 01:24:19,426
Inbound! Inbound!

1138
01:24:22,830 --> 01:24:24,131
Stand by!

1139
01:24:31,104 --> 01:24:32,406
Breakout, breakout!

1140
01:24:52,060 --> 01:24:53,728
One! Two!

1141
01:24:56,864 --> 01:24:57,832
Three!

1142
01:24:59,867 --> 01:25:01,736
-Last man!
-Moving!

1143
01:25:04,204 --> 01:25:05,405
Let's go!

1144
01:25:07,240 --> 01:25:08,475
We're out!

1145
01:25:13,982 --> 01:25:15,449
Get the fucking ramp up!

1146
01:27:32,620 --> 01:27:34,488
You made it. I didn't
think you were gonna make it.

1147
01:27:34,589 --> 01:27:36,791
I had a bet.
I lost the fucking bet.
