[phone ringing]

360
00:25:03,763 --> 00:25:04,763
Yeah?

361
00:25:06,026 --> 00:25:07,506
Wait, slow down.

362
00:25:08,289 --> 00:25:09,943
Call the police. I'm coming.

363
00:25:10,117 --> 00:25:11,161
[phone thuds]

364
00:25:11,901 --> 00:25:13,729
Rhodes: What? What's
going on, man?

365
00:25:13,903 --> 00:25:15,263
Bell: I never should
have left her.

366
00:25:20,519 --> 00:25:21,519
Fuck!

367
00:25:22,390 --> 00:25:23,957
Bell: Lock this behind me.

368
00:25:25,524 --> 00:25:27,700

[chuckles]

371
00:26:06,042 --> 00:26:08,567
Lu's on First, huh? [scoffs]

372
00:26:37,073 --> 00:26:38,640
So, that's what this is.

373
00:26:39,554 --> 00:26:40,903
What the fuck.

374
00:26:43,427 --> 00:26:46,605
[mellow piano music playing]

375
00:26:54,787 --> 00:26:58,747
Hey. Cute top.
Where'd you get that?

376
00:26:59,095 --> 00:27:00,270
[Sofia chuckles]

377
00:27:00,619 --> 00:27:02,882
Hey, look, it's cool
if you wanna... go.

378
00:27:03,056 --> 00:27:04,144
Oh.

379
00:27:05,580 --> 00:27:07,103
- That's it then?
- Sofia: Well, yeah.

380
00:27:07,277 --> 00:27:08,801
'Cause Bell's here,
Waylon's out front.

381
00:27:09,279 --> 00:27:10,367
Bell left.

382
00:27:12,631 --> 00:27:13,936
Where'd he go?

383
00:27:14,633 --> 00:27:17,418
[Officer Carter whistling]

384
00:27:22,423 --> 00:27:24,164
[knocks on door]

385
00:27:24,512 --> 00:27:26,949
Hello? Got a call!

386
00:27:27,994 --> 00:27:30,692
Hello? [clears throat]
Uh, got a call.

387
00:27:30,866 --> 00:27:32,172
Yes, there's a strange man here.

388
00:27:32,346 --> 00:27:33,782
- Inside?
- Outside.

389
00:27:34,653 --> 00:27:37,786
So, there's not a
man here-here, then?

390
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:39,092
No.

391
00:27:39,701 --> 00:27:41,921
Is that out of the ordinary?

392
00:27:42,182 --> 00:27:44,184
- For there to be a man outside?
- No.

393
00:27:44,401 --> 00:27:46,229
This seems to be a
fairly busy block.

394
00:27:46,490 --> 00:27:47,491
People walk.

395
00:27:47,666 --> 00:27:49,885
People stroll.

396
00:27:50,059 --> 00:27:51,321
Ms...?

397
00:27:51,539 --> 00:27:52,148
Eleanor: The guy was
creepy, all right?

398
00:27:52,322 --> 00:27:53,497
And it's late.

399
00:27:53,802 --> 00:27:55,442
You think I'd call the
cops for no reason?

400
00:27:58,807 --> 00:27:59,852
That him?

401
00:28:00,853 --> 00:28:01,854
What?

402
00:28:02,028 --> 00:28:03,507
Is that the man from outside?

403
00:28:04,595 --> 00:28:05,595
I'm not a man.

404
00:28:05,684 --> 00:28:06,859
[Officer Carter chuckles]

405
00:28:07,033 --> 00:28:08,313
Eleanor: You think
this is funny?

406
00:28:10,645 --> 00:28:12,691
No. But, uh...

407
00:28:12,995 --> 00:28:14,867
everything seems to be okay now.

408
00:28:15,302 --> 00:28:18,174
And I gotta get up early
for an audition, so...

409
00:28:18,348 --> 00:28:19,698
An audition?

410
00:28:19,872 --> 00:28:22,831
Musical. It's a black
box theater thing.

411
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:28,837
Okay. Look, if you really
want me to hang out here,

412
00:28:29,011 --> 00:28:31,274
I can, uh, stay here
and keep you safe.

413
00:28:31,579 --> 00:28:32,885
How about a cup of coffee?

414
00:28:33,581 --> 00:28:35,409
Oh, we'd feel safer

415
00:28:35,583 --> 00:28:37,672
if you protected us
from your car outside.

416
00:28:37,933 --> 00:28:39,369
- [kettle whistling]
- Bicycle.

417
00:28:39,543 --> 00:28:41,067
[Abby laughs]

418
00:28:41,241 --> 00:28:42,285
What?

419
00:28:42,459 --> 00:28:43,459
[kettle whistling]

420
00:28:47,203 --> 00:28:48,248
Okay.

421
00:28:50,685 --> 00:28:52,252
[chuckles]

422
00:28:57,344 --> 00:28:58,824
Should we get started
on the new one?

423
00:29:00,608 --> 00:29:01,783
Have you seen this movie?

424
00:29:02,958 --> 00:29:04,438
Because it looks like a riot.

425
00:29:07,267 --> 00:29:08,442
Something wrong?

426
00:29:08,616 --> 00:29:09,791
No.

427
00:29:10,226 --> 00:29:11,506
It looks like something's wrong.

428
00:29:12,707 --> 00:29:14,883
Rhodes: You worked so
hard on this puzzle and...

429
00:29:15,144 --> 00:29:17,233
we're just...

430
00:29:17,407 --> 00:29:19,148
just gonna clean it all up?

431
00:29:19,409 --> 00:29:20,769
Well yeah, that's
how puzzles work.

432
00:29:20,846 --> 00:29:22,499
Yeah, finished with that one.

433
00:29:31,073 --> 00:29:32,292
Are you crying?

434
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:33,640
Nah.

435
00:29:36,557 --> 00:29:37,558
Okay.

436
00:29:44,260 --> 00:29:45,479
I'm a puzzle.

437
00:29:47,350 --> 00:29:48,482
What?

438
00:29:49,570 --> 00:29:51,224
You built me up for a minute.

439
00:29:51,398 --> 00:29:54,793
You made me...
feel nice and...

440
00:29:54,967 --> 00:29:56,795
whole and comfortable, and...

441
00:29:57,621 --> 00:29:59,101
now, you're finished with me?

442
00:29:59,275 --> 00:30:00,475
I didn't say we were finished.

443
00:30:00,581 --> 00:30:01,756
Yeah, but we're finished.

444
00:30:01,930 --> 00:30:03,018
I can tell.

445
00:30:05,020 --> 00:30:08,197
Just... put me back in my box.

446
00:30:09,285 --> 00:30:11,113
Oo-kay. Um...

447
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:16,292
[slurping]

448
00:30:29,175 --> 00:30:31,742
[car door closing,
engine receding]

[country music playing on radio]

450
00:30:39,011 --> 00:30:41,622
Uh... okay.

451
00:30:44,103 --> 00:30:47,323
[country music continues]

452
00:30:59,205 --> 00:31:00,205
Hello?

453
00:31:01,207 --> 00:31:02,207
Hello?

454
00:31:17,658 --> 00:31:19,573
- [electricity dying]
- [music fades]

455
00:31:21,575 --> 00:31:24,186
[crickets chirping]

456
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:25,360
- Fuck.
- Sofia: Fuck.

457
00:31:25,492 --> 00:31:26,885
This keeps happening.

458
00:31:27,059 --> 00:31:29,365
They were supposed to
fix this shit weeks ago.

459
00:31:29,844 --> 00:31:30,671
[lighter clicks]

460
00:31:30,845 --> 00:31:32,020
Rhodes: Who is "they"?

461
00:31:32,847 --> 00:31:35,371
Sofia: I don't know.
The... light people?

462
00:31:37,112 --> 00:31:40,072
Rhodes: Okay. Where's
your circuit breaker?

463
00:31:40,463 --> 00:31:41,551
Sofia: I don't know.

464
00:31:43,423 --> 00:31:45,503
Rhodes: You don't know where
your circuit breaker is?

465
00:31:46,252 --> 00:31:48,254
Sofia: Do you know where
the circuit breaker is?

466
00:31:48,558 --> 00:31:49,777
This is your house.

467
00:31:50,517 --> 00:31:52,040
Sofia: Well...

468
00:31:52,214 --> 00:31:56,740
I have... many houses,
and many circuit breakers.

469
00:31:57,002 --> 00:31:58,177
[scoffs]

470
00:31:59,613 --> 00:32:00,919
What?

471
00:32:01,310 --> 00:32:03,182
That was such a
Sofia thing to say.

472
00:32:03,834 --> 00:32:05,271
Excuse me?

473
00:32:05,488 --> 00:32:06,988
Talking about how many
circuit breakers you have

474
00:32:07,012 --> 00:32:08,927
is a rich person thing to say.

475
00:32:09,405 --> 00:32:11,364
You're rich, so you can't talk.

476
00:32:12,191 --> 00:32:13,453
Rhodes: Rich...

477
00:32:13,627 --> 00:32:14,845
is a state of mind.

478
00:32:15,020 --> 00:32:16,020
[chuckles]

479
00:32:17,761 --> 00:32:18,849
What does that mean?

480
00:32:19,763 --> 00:32:21,069
Like this thing.

481
00:32:22,462 --> 00:32:24,725
It was a gift from
Liberace. It's funny.

482
00:32:24,899 --> 00:32:26,031
It's creepy.

483
00:32:26,292 --> 00:32:27,572
And I didn't know
people gave out

484
00:32:27,684 --> 00:32:29,556
these candle holders as gifts.

485
00:32:29,730 --> 00:32:32,211
But I guess fancy
clothing designers do.

486
00:32:34,300 --> 00:32:35,823
It's called a candelabra.

487
00:32:35,997 --> 00:32:37,738
[clears throat] And
Liberace was a pianist,

488
00:32:37,912 --> 00:32:39,435
you're thinking of Versace.

489
00:32:39,653 --> 00:32:42,612
Again, a very
Sofia thing to say.

490
00:32:47,704 --> 00:32:48,792
Waylon: Dammit.

491
00:32:51,273 --> 00:32:52,579
Ah, fuck.

492
00:32:55,538 --> 00:32:56,844
Come on.

493
00:33:04,721 --> 00:33:06,114
Sofia: Where are you going?

494
00:33:06,375 --> 00:33:07,815
Rhodes: To find your
circuit breaker.

495
00:33:09,813 --> 00:33:12,425
[Sofia sighs] Is
there a problem here?

496
00:33:12,729 --> 00:33:14,296
Actually, you know
what? I don't care.

497
00:33:14,470 --> 00:33:15,819
I'm not doing this with you.

498
00:33:15,994 --> 00:33:17,232
- [lighter clicks]
- Rhodes: Doing what?

499
00:33:17,256 --> 00:33:18,450
Sofia: Digging any
deeper with you.

500
00:33:18,474 --> 00:33:20,476
Rhodes: Yeah. No shit.

501
00:33:20,650 --> 00:33:21,976
Sofia: It is a
little weird, though.

502
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,306
For you to be
so... how you are.

503
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:25,873
Rhodes: Like a
Black guy, you mean?

504
00:33:26,047 --> 00:33:28,049
Sofia: Please. Come on.
You're nothing at all

505
00:33:28,223 --> 00:33:30,138
what people say about
you. You're more of a...

506
00:33:32,488 --> 00:33:35,230
[crickets chirping]

507
00:33:40,409 --> 00:33:42,089
Rhodes: I'm not like
what whosays about me?

508
00:33:42,194 --> 00:33:44,065
Whoever wrote that
list on your desk...

509
00:33:44,718 --> 00:33:45,980
that's some real Ice Queen shit

510
00:33:46,154 --> 00:33:47,808
to have just fucking
lying around.

511
00:33:47,982 --> 00:33:49,897
And, where do I fit in?

512
00:33:50,811 --> 00:33:52,571
How are you ever going
to find anything real?

513
00:33:52,682 --> 00:33:54,032
- Sofia: Real?
- Yeah.

514
00:33:54,206 --> 00:33:55,381
What is that even?

515
00:33:56,773 --> 00:33:57,861
[sneezes]

516
00:33:59,167 --> 00:34:00,516
Waylon: Who the fuck are you?

517
00:34:00,734 --> 00:34:02,364
Sofia: I'm very sorry
your feelings were hurt,

518
00:34:02,388 --> 00:34:03,930
but I kind of have other
things to worry about.

519
00:34:03,954 --> 00:34:05,671
The psycho who tried to
kill me is on the loose.

520
00:34:05,695 --> 00:34:07,480
He tried to kill Bell.
You weren't even home.

521
00:34:07,654 --> 00:34:09,221
He thought he was stabbing me.

522
00:34:09,395 --> 00:34:11,788
He wanted me dead! What
are you still doing here?

523
00:34:11,962 --> 00:34:13,312
I don't need you to protect me.

524
00:34:13,486 --> 00:34:15,029
Okay, yeah. 'Cause
you have armed guards

525
00:34:15,053 --> 00:34:16,552
and a security system
from the future, right?

526
00:34:16,576 --> 00:34:18,099
- Yeah, great point!
- Okay.

527
00:34:18,491 --> 00:34:19,555
- You're not needed at all.
- Rhodes: All right, I'm out.

528
00:34:19,579 --> 00:34:22,538
[Waylon groaning]

529
00:34:23,191 --> 00:34:26,847
[coughing and groaning]

530
00:34:27,717 --> 00:34:29,893
Oh, my balls!

531
00:34:30,068 --> 00:34:31,634
I enjoy this American hat.

532

[playful music playing]

533
00:34:33,680 --> 00:34:37,075
Uh-uh. Open sesame.
