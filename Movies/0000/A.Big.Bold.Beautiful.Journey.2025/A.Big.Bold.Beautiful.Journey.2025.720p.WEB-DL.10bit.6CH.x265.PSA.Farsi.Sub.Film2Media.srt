1
00:00:47,916 --> 00:00:49,684
<i>It's currently</i>
<i>74 degrees and sunny.</i>

2
00:00:49,817 --> 00:00:52,554
<i>It'll be hot and humid today,</i>
<i>with showers developing</i>

3
00:00:52,687 --> 00:00:54,856
<i>and chance of a thunderstorm.</i>

4
00:01:09,504 --> 00:01:10,538
Yep, I need to go.

5
00:01:10,672 --> 00:01:12,172
I'm, uh, running late.

6
00:01:12,306 --> 00:01:14,241
<i>Are you really</i>
<i>going to this wedding alone?</i>

7
00:01:14,642 --> 00:01:16,644
-Yeah, Mom. It's just me.
<i>-Honey.</i>

8
00:01:16,778 --> 00:01:18,746
<i>What?</i>
<i>I'm just asking him.</i>

9
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:20,247
<i>Are you okay, sweetheart?</i>

10
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:21,616
Mom, I'm more than okay.

11
00:01:21,749 --> 00:01:23,985
I'm fantastic.
Never been happier.

12
00:01:24,151 --> 00:01:26,621
Love traveling alone.
Love being alone.

13
00:01:26,754 --> 00:01:29,289
<i>David. Be open.</i>

14
00:01:29,423 --> 00:01:32,060
<i>I'd kick myself</i>
<i>if I never told my son that.</i>

15
00:01:32,192 --> 00:01:35,863
<i>Be open. Life is better</i>
<i>when you're open.</i>

16
00:01:35,997 --> 00:01:38,398
-A hundred percent, Dad.
<i>-And visit more.</i>

17
00:01:38,533 --> 00:01:40,568
Okay, will do. Love you guys.

18
00:01:40,702 --> 00:01:42,269
-Gotta go. Okay. Bye-bye.
<i>-Bye, I love you, boy.</i>

19
00:01:42,402 --> 00:01:43,236
<i>-Okay.</i>
<i>-Bye-bye.</i>

20
00:01:49,611 --> 00:01:51,512
Shit, shit, shit.

21
00:01:57,184 --> 00:01:58,151
Shit.

22
00:02:43,497 --> 00:02:44,966
<i>Can I help you?</i>

23
00:02:45,099 --> 00:02:46,768
-Yeah, I...
<i>-Name?</i>

24
00:02:47,267 --> 00:02:49,169
David Longley. I rented a car.

25
00:02:49,302 --> 00:02:50,638
<i>Hold the fuck</i>
<i>on a moment, please.</i>

26
00:02:54,042 --> 00:02:55,076
<i>Now, okay, David.</i>

27
00:02:55,643 --> 00:02:57,578
<i>When I buzz, open the door.</i>

28
00:02:58,378 --> 00:02:59,681
<i>But listen here,</i>
<i>because this is important.</i>

29
00:03:01,381 --> 00:03:03,518
<i>You gotta open it a half beat</i>
<i>after I start buzzing.</i>

30
00:03:05,285 --> 00:03:07,320
<i>If you try to open it a quarter</i>
<i>beat before the half beat,</i>

31
00:03:07,454 --> 00:03:09,222
<i>or a quarter beat after,</i>
<i>the door won't open,</i>

32
00:03:09,356 --> 00:03:11,025
<i>and we'll just have</i>
<i>to repeat the process,</i>

33
00:03:11,159 --> 00:03:13,460
<i>over and over and over again</i>
<i>until you finally get it.</i>

34
00:03:14,461 --> 00:03:15,997
Okay.

35
00:03:16,130 --> 00:03:18,465
<i>David, I guess</i>
<i>what I'm trying to say is...</i>

36
00:03:19,934 --> 00:03:20,835
<i>doors are tricky.</i>

37
00:03:21,636 --> 00:03:22,670
Sure.

38
00:03:23,171 --> 00:03:24,337
Sure, yeah, yeah.

39
00:03:24,471 --> 00:03:25,740
Doors are... Doors are tricky.

40
00:03:25,873 --> 00:03:26,941
<i>Agreed.</i>

41
00:03:27,075 --> 00:03:28,109
Ah...

42
00:03:28,241 --> 00:03:29,610
Damn it. I didn't...

43
00:03:29,744 --> 00:03:30,712
<i>Try again.</i>

44
00:03:33,681 --> 00:03:35,049
<i>Rushed it. Try again.</i>

45
00:03:39,987 --> 00:03:41,155
<i>Fuck yeah, David!</i>

46
00:03:56,204 --> 00:03:57,105
Hello?

47
00:03:57,939 --> 00:03:58,806
Hello, David.

48
00:04:00,908 --> 00:04:02,777
Longer walk
than you thought, right?

49
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:05,646
-Yeah.
-Okay.

50
00:04:06,114 --> 00:04:07,615
I'll see you
when you get up here.

51
00:04:27,367 --> 00:04:28,503
Stop right there on the mark.

52
00:04:33,975 --> 00:04:34,942
Slate you're name
for the camera.

53
00:04:35,408 --> 00:04:36,577
Sorry, "slate?"

54
00:04:37,044 --> 00:04:38,546
It just means, "Say your name."

55
00:04:39,346 --> 00:04:40,380
Ah.

56
00:04:40,515 --> 00:04:41,916
Uh, David Longley.

57
00:04:42,049 --> 00:04:44,852
Your car will be
a 1994 Saturn SL.

58
00:04:44,986 --> 00:04:47,320
A Saturn? I thought
they were out of business.

59
00:04:47,454 --> 00:04:48,455
Not here.

60
00:04:50,958 --> 00:04:51,993
Those the only cars you have?

61
00:04:52,126 --> 00:04:53,261
They're the only
fucking ones we need.

62
00:04:57,899 --> 00:04:59,366
What are you doing
with that photo there?

63
00:04:59,499 --> 00:05:00,802
-Oh, your headshot?
-Yeah.

64
00:05:00,935 --> 00:05:02,369
-Is this a problem?
-Yeah.

65
00:05:02,503 --> 00:05:03,938
Why?

66
00:05:04,071 --> 00:05:05,540
Because I don't ever remember
taking that picture.

67
00:05:07,241 --> 00:05:09,277
-And? And?
-And? And?

68
00:05:09,409 --> 00:05:10,310
-And?
-And...

69
00:05:11,879 --> 00:05:12,780
I'm not an actor.

70
00:05:16,784 --> 00:05:18,619
Could you say that
one more time, please?

71
00:05:18,753 --> 00:05:20,855
-Could I say what one more time?
-What you just said.

72
00:05:21,488 --> 00:05:22,757
I'm not an actor?

73
00:05:22,890 --> 00:05:24,692
That's it. Yeah. Go ahead.

74
00:05:31,498 --> 00:05:32,399
I'm not an actor.

75
00:05:35,837 --> 00:05:37,305
I think all of us
tend to act a lot, David.

76
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:40,808
I think we perform
more than we think we do.

77
00:05:41,408 --> 00:05:43,110
That's not necessarily
a bad thing.

78
00:05:43,945 --> 00:05:45,279
There are moments of real,
honest-to-goodness

79
00:05:45,412 --> 00:05:46,714
truth in performance, right?

80
00:05:48,481 --> 00:05:49,482
Sure.

81
00:05:52,019 --> 00:05:53,020
I mean, maybe.

82
00:05:53,154 --> 00:05:54,956
In fact, sometimes...

83
00:05:55,089 --> 00:05:58,092
we have to perform
to get to the truth.

84
00:05:59,492 --> 00:06:01,829
It's a more painful route,

85
00:06:01,963 --> 00:06:04,198
but sometimes pain is good.

86
00:06:08,903 --> 00:06:10,504
I love that.

87
00:06:10,638 --> 00:06:12,974
You should say that more often
when I say the thing I say.

88
00:06:13,507 --> 00:06:15,209
I will. From now on.

89
00:06:15,343 --> 00:06:16,244
Thank you
for taking my note.

90
00:06:17,511 --> 00:06:19,347
Now, do you want the GPS, David?

91
00:06:19,479 --> 00:06:21,549
Uh, no. I'll just hook up
my phone using a USB.

92
00:06:21,682 --> 00:06:23,217
There are no USBs in these cars.

93
00:06:23,351 --> 00:06:26,854
There's no USB
in a Saturn SL fucking 1994.

94
00:06:26,988 --> 00:06:29,757
Of course. Well, I'll just
listen to the GPS on my phone.

95
00:06:29,891 --> 00:06:31,391
But what if your phone
craps out on you?

96
00:06:31,525 --> 00:06:34,262
I don't think my phone will...
crap out.

97
00:06:34,394 --> 00:06:36,898
It might, David.
What if it does?

98
00:06:37,031 --> 00:06:38,065
People's phones crap out.

99
00:06:38,199 --> 00:06:39,466
They crap out
on them all the time.

100
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,401
My phone's never
crapped out on me.

101
00:06:41,535 --> 00:06:43,271
But what if it does, David?

102
00:06:43,971 --> 00:06:45,405
Won't you remember
this exact conversation?

103
00:06:45,539 --> 00:06:46,607
And won't you think,

104
00:06:46,741 --> 00:06:50,044
"Fuck me. Fuck me
so very, very hard"?

105
00:06:55,016 --> 00:06:56,751
I'm sorry, what is this place?

106
00:06:57,318 --> 00:06:58,653
This is
The Car Rental Agency.

107
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:01,088
Do you want the GPS?

108
00:07:01,222 --> 00:07:03,124
You want the GPS, David?

109
00:07:13,301 --> 00:07:14,467
Sure.

110
00:07:14,602 --> 00:07:15,803
Fuck yeah!

111
00:07:18,072 --> 00:07:21,776
<i>One singular sensation</i>

112
00:07:21,909 --> 00:07:23,978
<i>Every little step she takes</i>

113
00:07:25,713 --> 00:07:29,350
<i>One thrilling combination</i>

114
00:07:29,482 --> 00:07:32,053
<i>Every move that she makes</i>

115
00:07:32,186 --> 00:07:35,488
<i>Remain on</i>
<i>the interstate for 249 miles.</i>

116
00:07:36,257 --> 00:07:37,792
<i>The forecast</i>
<i>for your wedding trip</i>

117
00:07:37,925 --> 00:07:39,927
<i>is sunny skies</i>
<i>with non-stop rain.</i>

118
00:07:40,728 --> 00:07:43,130
<i>Fun fact,</i>
<i>in Hawaii, they call this...</i>

119
00:07:43,264 --> 00:07:44,966
-Liquid sunshine.
<i>-...liquid sunshine.</i>

120
00:07:45,099 --> 00:07:48,970
<i>...you know who</i>

121
00:07:49,103 --> 00:07:50,671
<i>One</i>

122
00:07:54,608 --> 00:07:56,243
<i>You have arrived</i>
<i>at your destination.</i>

123
00:08:12,994 --> 00:08:14,862
<i>You have arrived</i>
<i>at your destination.</i>

124
00:08:20,901 --> 00:08:21,802
Thanks.

125
00:09:15,623 --> 00:09:17,158
Thank you so much
for coming all this way.

126
00:09:17,291 --> 00:09:18,826
You joking? I wouldn't have
missed it for the world.

127
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:20,161
-Beautiful ceremony.
-Thank you.

128
00:09:20,294 --> 00:09:22,196
This is Sarah.
You guys live in the same city.

129
00:09:22,329 --> 00:09:23,431
-Oh, yeah.
-Oh.

130
00:09:23,564 --> 00:09:24,698
Hi. David.

131
00:09:25,633 --> 00:09:26,734
Hi.

132
00:09:26,867 --> 00:09:28,235
-Nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you.

133
00:09:28,369 --> 00:09:29,737
-Where do you live?
-Uh, downtown.

134
00:09:31,472 --> 00:09:33,007
-You?
-North side.

135
00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:34,575
Mmm.

136
00:09:34,708 --> 00:09:36,043
-Do you like it?
-Like what?

137
00:09:37,011 --> 00:09:38,145
Living downtown?

138
00:09:40,047 --> 00:09:41,215
Yeah.

139
00:09:41,348 --> 00:09:43,617
Well, it's our wedding...

140
00:09:43,751 --> 00:09:45,086
-Yeah.
-...so we're gonna leave.

141
00:09:45,219 --> 00:09:46,787
You two have a good night.
Okay, have fun.

142
00:09:57,965 --> 00:09:58,833
Do you want a drink?

143
00:10:03,237 --> 00:10:04,738
Uh, no.

144
00:10:06,373 --> 00:10:07,576
No, I'm good.

145
00:10:07,708 --> 00:10:09,877
-Very well.
-Thanks.

146
00:11:03,430 --> 00:11:05,299
Hi, I'm David
from the North side.

147
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:08,469
Oh, God!

148
00:11:08,603 --> 00:11:10,104
-Stop!
-Stop what?

149
00:11:10,237 --> 00:11:11,138
Just stop...

150
00:11:12,273 --> 00:11:13,542
trying to be charming.

151
00:11:16,645 --> 00:11:18,279
Why are you afraid of me?

152
00:11:19,013 --> 00:11:20,848
-You think I'm afraid of you?
-Yeah.

153
00:11:21,315 --> 00:11:22,449
I'm not afraid of you.

154
00:11:24,118 --> 00:11:25,554
I'm afraid of hurting you.

155
00:11:25,719 --> 00:11:27,522
-Of hurting me?
-Yeah.

156
00:11:27,656 --> 00:11:29,456
No matter how this plays out,

157
00:11:30,824 --> 00:11:32,226
it probably ends
in me hurting you.

158
00:11:33,761 --> 00:11:34,663
What if I hurt you?

159
00:11:35,429 --> 00:11:36,631
I won't let you.

160
00:11:37,131 --> 00:11:38,933
-I see. You're tough.
-I am.

161
00:11:40,569 --> 00:11:42,102
-And I'm not.
-Okay.

162
00:11:43,370 --> 00:11:44,573
Aren't you tough sometimes?

163
00:11:45,739 --> 00:11:47,174
-Yeah, sure.
-And then other times,

164
00:11:47,308 --> 00:11:48,242
you're just kind of...

165
00:11:49,476 --> 00:11:50,579
mush.

166
00:11:51,078 --> 00:11:52,947
-Mush?
-Yeah. No?

167
00:11:55,416 --> 00:11:56,685
Maybe it depends
on the person you're with.

168
00:11:58,653 --> 00:11:59,554
I don't know.

169
00:12:01,188 --> 00:12:02,524
So I bring out
the tough side in you.

170
00:12:04,425 --> 00:12:05,527
All the good ones do.

171
00:12:14,536 --> 00:12:15,736
Do you believe in marriage?

172
00:12:20,174 --> 00:12:21,676
You seem smarter
than that question.

173
00:12:21,809 --> 00:12:23,344
Well, humor me for a second.

174
00:12:23,477 --> 00:12:24,579
-Okay.
-Go on.

175
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:28,516
I believe
I shouldn't get married.

176
00:12:33,754 --> 00:12:34,723
Fair.

177
00:12:35,489 --> 00:12:36,390
What about you?

178
00:12:39,226 --> 00:12:40,595
When I was a kid, six or seven,

179
00:12:40,729 --> 00:12:42,396
they made us do
a picture in school.

180
00:12:42,530 --> 00:12:44,231
Of what we thought
the future would look like,

181
00:12:44,798 --> 00:12:48,670
and I drew a picture of me
with a bow tie and a top hat.

182
00:12:48,802 --> 00:12:49,770
Three kids.

183
00:12:50,538 --> 00:12:51,606
It's the truth.

184
00:12:51,740 --> 00:12:53,307
That's all I wanted.

185
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:54,441
Was to be a dad and be married.

186
00:12:55,876 --> 00:12:56,910
Swear to God.

187
00:13:02,717 --> 00:13:04,084
You want to marry me?

188
00:13:05,452 --> 00:13:07,087
I thought, didn't you just say
that you don't...

189
00:13:07,221 --> 00:13:08,022
Yeah, well, I changed my mind.

190
00:13:14,395 --> 00:13:15,296
Will you marry me?

191
00:13:21,468 --> 00:13:23,505
Oh, man, you have destroyed
some men, haven't you?

192
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:26,974
Yeah.

193
00:13:29,276 --> 00:13:30,811
And men have destroyed me.

194
00:13:31,746 --> 00:13:33,414
And I'm guessing since...

195
00:13:34,048 --> 00:13:35,617
you're still single,
you've probably done

196
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:37,351
some destroying of your own.

197
00:13:39,186 --> 00:13:40,321
Especially with that accent.

198
00:13:42,323 --> 00:13:43,257
Is it real?

199
00:13:44,458 --> 00:13:46,460
-Is what real?
-Your accent.

200
00:13:46,594 --> 00:13:47,861
You think I'd fake an accent?

201
00:13:50,799 --> 00:13:53,635
At a wedding? Yeah, maybe.

202
00:13:54,935 --> 00:13:56,638
Came over when I was 13.

203
00:13:56,771 --> 00:13:58,238
Mother American, Father Irish.

204
00:13:59,139 --> 00:14:00,040
Mom was homesick.

205
00:14:02,777 --> 00:14:03,911
What about you?

206
00:14:04,845 --> 00:14:06,080
Parents? Siblings?

207
00:14:06,847 --> 00:14:08,415
-I'm gonna go dance.
-All right. Enjoy.

208
00:14:09,483 --> 00:14:10,585
Okay.

209
00:14:11,185 --> 00:14:12,721
-You coming?
-I don't dance.

210
00:14:14,589 --> 00:14:15,489
I wish you would.

211
00:14:21,161 --> 00:14:22,196
Hey.

212
00:15:14,014 --> 00:15:14,915
I don't dance?

213
00:15:16,618 --> 00:15:17,552
I don't dance.

214
00:15:22,222 --> 00:15:23,758
Oh, for fucks sake.

215
00:15:40,107 --> 00:15:43,545
<i>Remain on interstate</i>
<i>for 237 miles.</i>

216
00:15:47,948 --> 00:15:51,619
<i>Two hundred and thirty-seven</i>

217
00:15:56,256 --> 00:15:57,191
<i>David?</i>

218
00:16:00,961 --> 00:16:01,863
<i>David?</i>

219
00:16:03,731 --> 00:16:04,666
Um...

220
00:16:05,767 --> 00:16:07,000
Yes?

221
00:16:07,468 --> 00:16:10,037
<i>Do you want to go on a big,</i>
<i>bold, beautiful journey?</i>

222
00:16:12,807 --> 00:16:15,375
Sorry, are we... Are we talking
to each other now?

223
00:16:15,510 --> 00:16:16,878
<i>David,</i>
<i>I'm asking you a question.</i>

224
00:16:18,412 --> 00:16:21,616
<i>Do you want to go on a big,</i>
<i>bold, beautiful journey?</i>

225
00:16:29,423 --> 00:16:31,358
-Yes.
<i>-What's that, David?</i>

226
00:16:33,595 --> 00:16:35,162
Yes, yes, I... I do.

227
00:16:35,964 --> 00:16:37,364
<i>What do you</i>
<i>want to do, David?</i>

228
00:16:42,269 --> 00:16:45,138
I want to go on a big,
bold, beautiful journey.

229
00:16:45,272 --> 00:16:47,174
<i>Say it again, David.</i>
<i>Like you mean it.</i>

230
00:16:50,778 --> 00:16:53,046
I want to go on a big...

231
00:16:55,048 --> 00:16:56,016
bold, beautiful journey.

232
00:16:56,149 --> 00:16:57,819
<i>One more time, David.</i>

233
00:16:57,952 --> 00:16:59,954
<i>With a kind of passion that</i>
<i>suggests that before you die,</i>

234
00:17:00,087 --> 00:17:02,489
<i>you need to experience</i>
<i>what it feels like to be big.</i>

235
00:17:02,624 --> 00:17:04,191
<i>Bigger than Earth itself.</i>

236
00:17:04,324 --> 00:17:06,861
<i>No more of this, "We're all</i>

237
00:17:06,995 --> 00:17:09,396
<i>Do you want to go on a big,</i>
<i>bold, beautiful journey, David?</i>

238
00:17:11,031 --> 00:17:12,767
I wanna go on a big,

239
00:17:12,901 --> 00:17:15,837
bold, beautiful,
motherfucking journey!

240
00:17:18,573 --> 00:17:19,874
<i>Great, David.</i>

241
00:17:20,008 --> 00:17:21,910
<i>Take the next exit</i>
<i>at Kiki's Travel Plaza</i>

242
00:17:22,042 --> 00:17:24,244
<i>and eat a fast food</i>
<i>cheeseburger.</i>

243
00:17:55,777 --> 00:17:57,077
Hmm.

244
00:18:05,185 --> 00:18:07,421
Hi, David from the North Side.

245
00:18:07,555 --> 00:18:09,456
Hey, Downtown Sarah.

246
00:18:12,359 --> 00:18:13,427
What are you doing here?

247
00:18:14,562 --> 00:18:16,296
Having
a cheeseburger.

248
00:18:17,230 --> 00:18:19,601
When was the last time you had
a fast-food cheeseburger?

249
00:18:19,734 --> 00:18:21,335
Why you call
it a fast-food cheeseburger?

250
00:18:21,468 --> 00:18:23,103
Isn't that what it is?

251
00:18:23,236 --> 00:18:25,238
Well, yeah,
but I mean, technically,

252
00:18:25,372 --> 00:18:26,574
it's a Whopper with cheese.

253
00:18:27,441 --> 00:18:30,078
Okay. When did you last have
a Whopper with cheese?

254
00:18:30,210 --> 00:18:31,211
I don't know, actually.

255
00:18:32,046 --> 00:18:34,381
About 20 or 25 years ago.

256
00:18:34,916 --> 00:18:35,984
Snob.

257
00:18:38,218 --> 00:18:39,754
When was the last time you had
a fast-food cheeseburger?

258
00:18:39,887 --> 00:18:41,288
I eat 'em every day.

259
00:18:41,889 --> 00:18:43,123
Breakfast, lunch and dinner.

260
00:18:43,256 --> 00:18:44,391
Oh, yeah?

261
00:18:45,026 --> 00:18:47,160
-Mmm...Mmm...
-Huh...

262
00:18:47,294 --> 00:18:48,328
Wow.

263
00:18:48,462 --> 00:18:50,263
-Hungry?
-Mmm-hmm.

264
00:18:53,233 --> 00:18:54,234
Mmm.

265
00:18:55,268 --> 00:18:56,203
So...

266
00:18:59,007 --> 00:19:00,008
So...

267
00:19:02,175 --> 00:19:03,477
So we live in the same city.

268
00:19:03,611 --> 00:19:04,545
Correct.

269
00:19:05,980 --> 00:19:06,948
Yeah.

270
00:19:08,281 --> 00:19:09,149
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

271
00:19:12,086 --> 00:19:13,121
Are you gonna...

272
00:19:17,592 --> 00:19:19,292
ask me out or something?

273
00:19:19,426 --> 00:19:20,227
Would you like to be asked out?

274
00:19:21,361 --> 00:19:22,830
I asked you

275
00:19:22,964 --> 00:19:24,565
-to marry me last night.
-Yeah, but that was bullshit.

276
00:19:24,699 --> 00:19:26,466
-Was it?
-Wasn't it?

277
00:19:29,469 --> 00:19:30,772
I guess you'll never know now.

278
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:34,174
Oh, God.

279
00:19:35,308 --> 00:19:36,844
The pain of early regret.

280
00:19:38,278 --> 00:19:39,714
Also known as dating.

281
00:19:41,314 --> 00:19:42,382
So we're not gonna date?

282
00:19:44,484 --> 00:19:45,720
Wouldn't be worth the risk.

283
00:19:46,386 --> 00:19:47,320
The risk?

284
00:19:48,321 --> 00:19:49,524
The risk.

285
00:19:50,424 --> 00:19:51,358
Pessimistic.

286
00:19:55,596 --> 00:19:56,798
I'm glad we got that
out of the way.

287
00:19:56,931 --> 00:19:58,666
-Yeah, thank God.
-You want an onion ring?

288
00:19:59,299 --> 00:20:00,200
-Please.
-Mmm.

289
00:20:01,401 --> 00:20:02,737
Delicious.

290
00:20:02,870 --> 00:20:04,271
This is the only ring
I'll be getting from you.

291
00:20:18,586 --> 00:20:19,721
All right, well...

292
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:22,557
Yeah, nice knowing you.

293
00:20:22,690 --> 00:20:24,092
Nice arguing with you.

294
00:20:40,675 --> 00:20:42,076
Did you get the GPS?

295
00:20:42,210 --> 00:20:43,611
Yeah, because...

296
00:20:43,745 --> 00:20:45,345
Sometimes your phone
craps out on you.

297
00:21:00,795 --> 00:21:01,996
-Okay.
-Yeah.

298
00:21:05,566 --> 00:21:06,734
Well, enjoy your journey.

299
00:21:07,702 --> 00:21:08,636
You, too.

300
00:21:11,539 --> 00:21:12,940
-Bye, Sarah.
-Bye, David.

301
00:21:19,213 --> 00:21:20,515
-Hey, Sarah.
-Yeah.

302
00:21:21,481 --> 00:21:22,750
What I was saying...

303
00:21:24,218 --> 00:21:25,153
I do dance.

304
00:21:40,467 --> 00:21:42,302
<i>You have arrived</i>
<i>at your destination.</i>

305
00:21:42,435 --> 00:21:44,337
I'm ready for my journey.

306
00:21:48,109 --> 00:21:49,010
<i>Pick up Sarah.</i>

307
00:22:00,087 --> 00:22:01,756
My car won't start.

308
00:22:07,494 --> 00:22:08,461
<i>Welcome</i>
<i>to your journey,</i>

309
00:22:08,596 --> 00:22:09,797
<i>Sarah and David.</i>

310
00:22:11,966 --> 00:22:13,333
Do you have any clue
where we're headed?

311
00:22:14,535 --> 00:22:15,468
None, whatsoever.

312
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:07,922
<i>You have arrived</i>
<i>at your first stop.</i>

313
00:23:09,389 --> 00:23:11,559
Should we be
trusting the GPS?

314
00:23:11,692 --> 00:23:12,960
I have nothing to lose.

315
00:23:14,528 --> 00:23:15,462
Me neither.

316
00:23:21,335 --> 00:23:22,236
What is that?

317
00:23:29,844 --> 00:23:30,745
Excuse me.

318
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:40,221
Very bizarre.

319
00:23:44,392 --> 00:23:45,259
What's around there?

320
00:23:47,261 --> 00:23:48,930
Dead bodies.

321
00:23:49,931 --> 00:23:50,898
Shut up.

322
00:24:01,509 --> 00:24:02,376
We have to go through it.

323
00:24:03,678 --> 00:24:04,612
Why?

324
00:24:05,947 --> 00:24:06,847
We just do.

325
00:24:10,584 --> 00:24:11,419
What do you think's
behind there?

326
00:24:13,654 --> 00:24:14,755
More of this?

327
00:24:14,889 --> 00:24:15,823
You think?

328
00:24:16,924 --> 00:24:18,326
I don't know. Come on.

329
00:24:27,935 --> 00:24:29,637
Oh, my God.

330
00:24:45,786 --> 00:24:47,655
Holy shit. I know this place.

331
00:24:47,788 --> 00:24:49,156
Are you gonna tell me
what's going on?

332
00:24:49,290 --> 00:24:51,592
We're visiting
a preserved lighthouse

333
00:24:51,726 --> 00:24:52,760
from the 19th century.

334
00:24:53,427 --> 00:24:54,328
Where?

335
00:24:55,062 --> 00:24:55,997
Canada.

336
00:24:57,264 --> 00:24:59,133
Canada, okay.

337
00:24:59,767 --> 00:25:01,335
Came here
a few years back.

338
00:25:01,469 --> 00:25:03,037
On a little trip of my own.

339
00:25:09,010 --> 00:25:12,046
Are you some kind of weird
lighthouse freak?

340
00:25:12,179 --> 00:25:13,848
Now that you say it,
I wish I was.

341
00:25:13,981 --> 00:25:15,149
Is that... That's your thing?

342
00:25:17,451 --> 00:25:18,853
This is unbelievable.

343
00:25:32,366 --> 00:25:33,601
Why were you here by yourself?

344
00:25:35,369 --> 00:25:36,737
I travel alone all the time.

345
00:25:37,705 --> 00:25:38,672
Me too.

346
00:25:44,779 --> 00:25:46,380
It's funny
how the most beautiful places

347
00:25:46,515 --> 00:25:47,882
make you feel the most alone.
You know?

348
00:25:49,518 --> 00:25:50,718
No matter where you go,
you always

349
00:25:50,851 --> 00:25:51,886
end up going
to the top of something

350
00:25:52,019 --> 00:25:53,087
and looking down at something.

351
00:25:53,220 --> 00:25:54,422
Most places
have a thing like that.

352
00:25:54,555 --> 00:25:55,823
You know,
you go to the top and you...

353
00:25:57,191 --> 00:25:58,659
you look out and you look down,

354
00:25:58,793 --> 00:25:59,827
and you're supposed to have
an epiphany

355
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:01,562
about who you are and...

356
00:26:03,130 --> 00:26:04,565
about your life and...

357
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:07,334
where it's headed.

358
00:26:13,741 --> 00:26:14,809
Well, do you know
where it's headed?

359
00:26:18,679 --> 00:26:19,747
No, Sarah, I do not.

360
00:26:21,615 --> 00:26:23,651
Did you have an epiphany
the last time you were here?

361
00:26:23,784 --> 00:26:24,919
No.

362
00:26:27,522 --> 00:26:28,756
Felt nothing.

363
00:26:29,790 --> 00:26:31,392
So you didn't take this all in?

364
00:26:35,530 --> 00:26:36,430
Not even close.

365
00:26:40,901 --> 00:26:41,802
What about now?

366
00:26:53,013 --> 00:26:55,082
<i>Did that really just happen?</i>

367
00:26:55,216 --> 00:26:56,317
Apparently.

368
00:26:56,450 --> 00:26:57,985
A red door
in the middle of the woods.

369
00:26:59,386 --> 00:27:00,321
Like, who put it there?

370
00:27:04,058 --> 00:27:06,293
<i>Next stop</i>
<i>is in 79 miles.</i>

371
00:27:08,729 --> 00:27:09,997
Hey, what's this all about?

372
00:27:10,131 --> 00:27:11,432
<i>Proceed to the route.</i>

373
00:27:13,568 --> 00:27:14,536
I'm talking to you.

374
00:27:15,636 --> 00:27:16,804
<i>Proceed to the route.</i>

375
00:27:30,251 --> 00:27:31,185
Locked?

376
00:27:34,054 --> 00:27:34,989
Yeah.

377
00:27:53,073 --> 00:27:54,775
-Sarah.
-Vincent.

378
00:27:56,844 --> 00:27:58,279
Is everything okay?

379
00:27:59,346 --> 00:28:00,515
Yeah.

380
00:28:00,981 --> 00:28:02,449
-Your flashlight.
-Yes!

381
00:28:04,451 --> 00:28:05,520
-Thanks.
-Enjoy.

382
00:28:05,986 --> 00:28:06,987
See you on the way out, Vincent.

383
00:28:07,121 --> 00:28:08,055
I'll be here.

384
00:28:13,961 --> 00:28:15,362
Where are we?

385
00:28:15,496 --> 00:28:17,731
We are at my favorite museum.

386
00:28:18,299 --> 00:28:19,099
What are we doing here?

387
00:28:20,301 --> 00:28:21,869
Probably gonna look
at paintings.

388
00:28:23,370 --> 00:28:24,539
Cool.

389
00:29:34,609 --> 00:29:35,843
My mom's dead.

390
00:29:39,813 --> 00:29:40,948
What painting is that?

391
00:29:42,816 --> 00:29:43,752
That's very funny.

392
00:29:45,886 --> 00:29:48,188
She died when I was 19, but...

393
00:29:48,922 --> 00:29:51,458
growing up, we would come here
at least once a month.

394
00:29:52,793 --> 00:29:54,562
Vincent would let us
have the museum

395
00:29:54,696 --> 00:29:56,564
all to ourselves
during closing hours.

396
00:29:56,698 --> 00:29:59,734
He loved my mom. Loved her.

397
00:30:01,736 --> 00:30:04,606
And then when she died,
I started coming once a week.

398
00:30:06,307 --> 00:30:08,643
Yeah, and then I just got busy,
that kind of thing.

399
00:30:10,811 --> 00:30:12,346
-Happens.
-Hmm.

400
00:30:13,447 --> 00:30:15,182
Well, my mom's alive.

401
00:30:17,418 --> 00:30:18,687
Oh, great.

402
00:30:18,819 --> 00:30:19,987
Yeah. Not dead.

403
00:30:20,387 --> 00:30:22,389
That is so awesome for you.

404
00:30:22,524 --> 00:30:23,857
-Dad, on the other hand...
-Dead?

405
00:30:24,825 --> 00:30:25,727
No. Alive.

406
00:30:30,264 --> 00:30:31,398
I think my dad's alive.

407
00:30:33,133 --> 00:30:34,034
I wish he were dead.

408
00:30:39,173 --> 00:30:41,208
<i>I actually went on a road trip</i>
<i>with my dad once.</i>

409
00:30:41,776 --> 00:30:43,010
-Oh, Yeah?
-Yeah.

410
00:30:43,143 --> 00:30:44,912
We went to the, um...

411
00:30:45,045 --> 00:30:46,847
Baseball Hall of Fame
in Cooperstown.

412
00:30:46,980 --> 00:30:47,881
You like baseball?

413
00:30:48,882 --> 00:30:50,084
What? No, he did.

414
00:30:50,217 --> 00:30:52,453
Well, he "does" I guess.

415
00:30:53,521 --> 00:30:55,022
Um...

416
00:30:55,155 --> 00:30:57,024
And I remember
he brought this big bag

417
00:30:57,157 --> 00:30:59,460
of unshelled sunflower seeds,

418
00:30:59,594 --> 00:31:01,028
and I ate the whole bag
and I got sick.

419
00:31:01,161 --> 00:31:02,863
So you didn't like baseball
and you got sick?

420
00:31:03,464 --> 00:31:04,331
Yeah.

421
00:31:05,432 --> 00:31:06,367
Yeah.

422
00:31:07,167 --> 00:31:08,135
But...

423
00:31:13,608 --> 00:31:15,008
It was actually
a really great time.

424
00:31:15,142 --> 00:31:16,910
We had a great time. He, um...

425
00:31:20,648 --> 00:31:23,250
When I had his attention,
he was actually pretty great.

426
00:31:33,561 --> 00:31:34,461
So tell me.

427
00:31:35,830 --> 00:31:36,897
Why are you single?

428
00:31:41,034 --> 00:31:42,302
You really wanna know?

429
00:31:42,436 --> 00:31:43,404
Yeah.

430
00:31:46,508 --> 00:31:47,809
It's because I cheat.

431
00:31:49,711 --> 00:31:51,713
Even when I don't want to cheat,
I'll end up cheating.

432
00:31:51,846 --> 00:31:55,082
Even when the person
I'm with is perfect, I'll cheat.

433
00:31:57,384 --> 00:31:58,919
Okay.

434
00:31:59,052 --> 00:32:01,890
It makes me feel like
one half of me is always single

435
00:32:02,022 --> 00:32:04,759
and doesn't have to give a shit
about anyone else but myself,

436
00:32:04,893 --> 00:32:06,960
and so then that half...

437
00:32:08,530 --> 00:32:09,798
cheats and...

438
00:32:10,865 --> 00:32:11,800
gets caught.

439
00:32:12,867 --> 00:32:15,570
And then all of me is single,

440
00:32:15,703 --> 00:32:17,938
and that's what I'd rather be
in the first place.

441
00:32:20,073 --> 00:32:21,375
Not the answer I expected.

442
00:32:28,783 --> 00:32:31,151
And why are you single?

443
00:32:32,152 --> 00:32:33,588
Oh...

444
00:32:33,721 --> 00:32:35,155
I suppose I haven't
met the right one yet.

445
00:32:35,824 --> 00:32:37,659
David, you've probably
met the right one,

446
00:32:37,792 --> 00:32:39,193
like, a hundred times already.

447
00:32:39,326 --> 00:32:41,328
Mmm, I wish that was true
even once, Sarah, but...

448
00:32:41,462 --> 00:32:43,430
That's such
a bullshit answer.

449
00:32:43,565 --> 00:32:45,299
I gave you honest fucking truth.

450
00:32:45,966 --> 00:32:47,501
And you're going to give me,

451
00:32:47,635 --> 00:32:49,369
"I haven't met
the right one yet."

452
00:32:49,504 --> 00:32:50,638
Just because
you don't like the answer

453
00:32:50,772 --> 00:32:51,873
doesn't mean
it's a bullshit answer.

454
00:32:52,005 --> 00:32:53,340
You've probably given
the "I cheat" speech

455
00:32:53,474 --> 00:32:54,676
a thousand times.

456
00:32:55,442 --> 00:32:57,612
And I betcha anything it makes
guys want you even more.

457
00:32:58,746 --> 00:33:00,047
Yeah? Any truth to that?

458
00:33:00,782 --> 00:33:02,082
Sounded a little bit rehearsed.

459
00:33:03,250 --> 00:33:05,452
Kind of like your top
of the lighthouse bullshit?

460
00:33:07,889 --> 00:33:09,122
"The most beautiful places

461
00:33:09,256 --> 00:33:11,091
"make you feel the most alone."

462
00:33:11,726 --> 00:33:13,393
Oh, that's a pretty good me,
actually. I'm flattered.

463
00:33:13,962 --> 00:33:15,162
<i>In 0.5 miles,</i>

464
00:33:15,295 --> 00:33:17,130
<i>you will arrive</i>
<i>at your destination.</i>

465
00:33:22,402 --> 00:33:24,304
-Oh, my God.
-Oh, shit.

466
00:33:24,438 --> 00:33:25,607
Is that your high school?

467
00:33:25,740 --> 00:33:26,674
Yeah, how'd you know?

468
00:33:26,808 --> 00:33:28,242
Well, two reasons.

469
00:33:28,375 --> 00:33:30,912
One, those could
only be high school doors.

470
00:33:31,779 --> 00:33:33,413
And the second reason?

471
00:33:33,548 --> 00:33:34,516
I'll tell you later.

472
00:33:34,649 --> 00:33:35,917
-No, wait, wait.
-What?

473
00:33:36,684 --> 00:33:37,652
Um...

474
00:33:38,620 --> 00:33:40,053
You know, I'm not sure.

475
00:33:40,788 --> 00:33:41,856
What?

476
00:33:41,990 --> 00:33:43,925
Well, I went here
for four years,

477
00:33:44,057 --> 00:33:46,561
but I don't know
who or what, when...

478
00:33:47,562 --> 00:33:48,696
-You know.
-It's okay.

479
00:33:48,830 --> 00:33:50,097
-High school.
-It's okay.

480
00:33:50,230 --> 00:33:51,331
-Uh...
-We'll find out.

481
00:33:52,466 --> 00:33:53,433
Come on.

482
00:33:57,237 --> 00:33:58,606
Oh, wow!

483
00:34:01,475 --> 00:34:02,844
You've got to be fucking
kidding me.

484
00:34:04,879 --> 00:34:06,079
Jesus Christ.

485
00:34:06,213 --> 00:34:07,180
Hi, David.

486
00:34:08,016 --> 00:34:09,182
David, what are you doing?

487
00:34:09,316 --> 00:34:10,217
-Mr. Nelson.
-You're late. Come on.

488
00:34:10,350 --> 00:34:11,351
No, no, no. You're dead.

489
00:34:11,485 --> 00:34:12,754
-What?
-You're dead.

490
00:34:12,887 --> 00:34:14,856
I was at your funeral.
It's four years from now.

491
00:34:14,989 --> 00:34:16,356
I mean, look, maybe I was wrong,

492
00:34:16,490 --> 00:34:18,026
but get your pancreas checked,
will you? And soon.

493
00:34:18,158 --> 00:34:20,093
David, I don't know what kind
of pre-show routine

494
00:34:20,227 --> 00:34:21,428
you're doing here,
but there's no time.

495
00:34:21,563 --> 00:34:23,898
Curtain's in half an hour.
Half hour, everyone.

496
00:34:24,032 --> 00:34:25,098
Mr. Nelson, how old am I?

497
00:34:25,232 --> 00:34:26,233
You're 15.

498
00:34:26,366 --> 00:34:28,068
-I'm 15.
-Cool.

499
00:34:28,201 --> 00:34:30,738
-How old am I?
-I don't know. 40?

500
00:34:30,872 --> 00:34:33,473
I'm gonna kill you today.
Forget four years from now.

501
00:34:34,742 --> 00:34:35,743
Fucking 40?

502
00:34:39,013 --> 00:34:40,080
You nervous for tonight?

503
00:34:41,081 --> 00:34:42,817
Yeah. You're gonna kill them.

504
00:34:44,786 --> 00:34:46,955
Yeah. Break a leg, okay?

505
00:34:49,023 --> 00:34:49,924
Who's that?

506
00:34:50,758 --> 00:34:51,659
Cheryl Hayward.

507
00:34:52,894 --> 00:34:54,294
She, uh, plays Rosemary.

508
00:34:54,428 --> 00:34:55,830
So, are you in this show?

509
00:34:55,964 --> 00:34:57,097
You're in this musical?

510
00:34:57,230 --> 00:34:59,399
Yeah. I play, um,
J. Pierrepont Finch.

511
00:35:01,134 --> 00:35:02,971
-You're J. Pierrepont Finch?
-Yes.

512
00:35:04,572 --> 00:35:06,273
What? That's amazing.

513
00:35:06,406 --> 00:35:07,374
Oh, you did the show?

514
00:35:07,508 --> 00:35:09,376
God, I wish. No.

515
00:35:09,510 --> 00:35:10,778
Ex-musical groupie.

516
00:35:10,912 --> 00:35:11,879
-Huh.
-Mmm.

517
00:35:13,081 --> 00:35:14,616
After her solo, I, um...

518
00:35:15,717 --> 00:35:16,584
I tell her I love her.

519
00:35:17,417 --> 00:35:19,119
Oh, wow. Okay.

520
00:35:19,252 --> 00:35:21,623
She says, "I don't love you.
I love Clint Whitford."

521
00:35:21,756 --> 00:35:23,958
And I'm... devastated.

522
00:35:24,092 --> 00:35:25,593
Who's Clint Whitford?

523
00:35:25,727 --> 00:35:27,929
This fucking asshole,
prick, college freshman.

524
00:35:28,062 --> 00:35:29,329
He treats her like shit.

525
00:35:30,197 --> 00:35:31,566
-Wow.
-That night...

526
00:35:32,100 --> 00:35:33,467
I mean, tonight, I go home

527
00:35:33,601 --> 00:35:34,969
and I don't even
get out of my costume.

528
00:35:35,103 --> 00:35:36,537
I go up to my playroom,

529
00:35:36,671 --> 00:35:39,874
I plant myself face down
on the couch, and I cry.

530
00:35:40,008 --> 00:35:41,208
You have a playroom?

531
00:35:41,676 --> 00:35:43,111
I cried so hard. Jesus.

532
00:35:43,578 --> 00:35:44,478
God, it feels like it...

533
00:35:46,446 --> 00:35:48,616
Oh, feels exactly
like it felt that night.

534
00:35:48,750 --> 00:35:50,618
-Okay, well...
-Except now I know it's worse.

535
00:35:50,752 --> 00:35:52,352
No, because I know she's gonna
just destroy me all over again.

536
00:35:53,453 --> 00:35:54,354
Okay, just don't...

No, but I have to.

539
00:35:59,459 --> 00:36:01,194
Why? You just said that you know

540
00:36:01,328 --> 00:36:02,697
that she's not going
to say it back.

541
00:36:04,799 --> 00:36:05,800
Maybe she will.

542
00:36:06,366 --> 00:36:07,769
She won't.

543
00:36:08,936 --> 00:36:09,871
-I have to.
-David?

544
00:36:11,673 --> 00:36:12,974
Hair and makeup right now.

00:36:35,563 --> 00:36:36,764
Uh, I don't know.

He's so talented.

560
00:36:49,409 --> 00:36:50,611
He worked very hard.

561
00:36:50,745 --> 00:36:52,513
Yeah. He went after it,
he deserves it.

562
00:36:52,647 --> 00:36:54,749
Yeah. And he's just
a really special kid.

<i>I wonder if</i>
<i>we take the same bus</i>

<i>That could be</i>
<i>Quite a thing between us</i>

657
00:42:23,978 --> 00:42:26,180

<i>He really is a dear</i>

659

<i>And he says</i>

That was fuckin'...
How did you know?

676
00:43:26,707 --> 00:43:27,975
What can I say?

677
00:43:28,109 --> 00:43:30,811
A good musical groupie
always knows the songs.

678
00:43:31,345 --> 00:43:32,313
Thanks for the save.

679
00:43:32,780 --> 00:43:33,714
You're welcome.

680
00:43:39,521 --> 00:43:40,721
Ah.

681
00:43:41,188 --> 00:43:42,990
It's actually
the second reason I knew

682
00:43:43,124 --> 00:43:44,758
that those
were high school doors.

You're secretly a dork.

685
00:43:50,731 --> 00:43:51,665
Not so secret.

686
00:43:51,799 --> 00:43:52,867
Yeah, not anymore.

687
00:43:55,836 --> 00:43:59,340
High school's really fucking
important to dorks like us.

688
00:44:01,675 --> 00:44:03,844
It's pretty formative.

689
00:44:06,847 --> 00:44:08,550
It's formative as fuck.

690
00:44:13,687 --> 00:44:14,688
Thanks.

691
00:44:14,822 --> 00:44:15,723
You're welcome.

692
00:44:52,259 --> 00:44:54,929
You were
different back there.

693
00:44:55,062 --> 00:44:56,230
How was I different?

694
00:44:58,399 --> 00:44:59,366
Very...

695
00:45:01,135 --> 00:45:02,436
heart on your sleeve.

696
00:45:02,571 --> 00:45:03,737
Mmm.

697
00:45:05,406 --> 00:45:06,575
Yeah, that was me back then.

698
00:45:06,707 --> 00:45:08,008
Back when I thought that the...

699
00:45:09,410 --> 00:45:10,679
Go on. Thought what?

700
00:45:12,246 --> 00:45:13,414
Back when I thought

701
00:45:13,548 --> 00:45:15,049
that everything
would work out for me.

702
00:45:16,350 --> 00:45:17,851
That I'd get what I want

703
00:45:17,985 --> 00:45:20,221
and that I'd be... happy.

704
00:45:22,356 --> 00:45:23,625
Because you're so special?

705
00:45:28,329 --> 00:45:29,230
Where'd you hear that?

706
00:45:29,363 --> 00:45:30,565
Nowhere.

707
00:45:30,699 --> 00:45:33,000
I saw you sitting
behind my mom and dad.

708
00:45:33,133 --> 00:45:36,237
They may have mentioned you
being special, like...

709
00:45:37,539 --> 00:45:38,739
30 times.

710
00:45:39,840 --> 00:45:41,742
I swear to God, if I could
go back to me as a kid,

711
00:45:41,875 --> 00:45:43,877
I would say,
"David, you little prick,

712
00:45:44,579 --> 00:45:46,581
"you're not that special.
Get over yourself."

713
00:45:48,415 --> 00:45:50,284
-Would you?
-I would, actually, yeah.

714
00:45:50,751 --> 00:45:52,486
Yeah, I mean,
it just causes you...

715
00:45:53,387 --> 00:45:55,022
It sets you up
for a spectacular fall.

716
00:45:59,059 --> 00:46:00,729
So what is it that you want,
David?

717
00:46:02,697 --> 00:46:03,764
What do you mean, Sarah?

718
00:46:06,701 --> 00:46:07,669
Are you still...

719
00:46:10,037 --> 00:46:12,172
chasing the Cheryls
of this world?

720
00:46:14,609 --> 00:46:15,909
You know, it's been a long time

721
00:46:16,043 --> 00:46:17,512
since I've felt that anyone
was worth the chase.

722
00:46:20,214 --> 00:46:21,583
Are you chasing me?

723
00:46:30,924 --> 00:46:32,627
Because if you are,
you should just stop.

724
00:46:34,461 --> 00:46:36,096
Seriously, David,
I'm just gonna end up

725
00:46:36,230 --> 00:46:37,732
disappointing you,
like everyone else has,

726
00:46:37,865 --> 00:46:39,233
so, you should just stop.

727
00:46:46,807 --> 00:46:47,841
<i>What are you doing?</i>

728
00:46:47,975 --> 00:46:49,476
<i>I didn't mean stop the car.</i>

729
00:47:03,490 --> 00:47:05,292
Okay, this is getting
too dramatic.

730
00:47:12,466 --> 00:47:15,035
Sometimes we have
to perform to get to the truth.

731
00:47:39,761 --> 00:47:41,529
<i>Doctor Morgan,</i>
<i>please call recovery.</i>

732
00:47:46,266 --> 00:47:47,234
Hi, Sarah.

733
00:47:47,935 --> 00:47:49,002
Hi, Dr. Vernon.

734
00:47:49,136 --> 00:47:50,471
How's everything at school?

735
00:47:50,605 --> 00:47:52,473
I think at this point,

736
00:47:52,607 --> 00:47:54,743
I was having an affair
with my professor.

737
00:47:56,143 --> 00:47:58,078
-Uh, can we just get to it?
-Sure.

738
00:47:59,880 --> 00:48:01,382
Your mom passed away
about an hour ago.

739
00:48:04,853 --> 00:48:06,353
Was she comfortable?

740
00:48:06,487 --> 00:48:07,555
She was comfortable.

741
00:48:08,556 --> 00:48:10,057
-No pain?
-None.

742
00:48:10,792 --> 00:48:12,627
-You fucking swear?
-I fucking swear.

743
00:48:14,529 --> 00:48:16,230
-Did he...
-No.

744
00:48:16,897 --> 00:48:18,566
Your father hasn't been here
in months.

745
00:48:20,501 --> 00:48:21,870
So, she was alone when she died.

746
00:48:22,002 --> 00:48:24,204
I assure you,
she was on a lot of medication.

747
00:48:24,338 --> 00:48:26,140
So, she was alone when she died?

748
00:48:27,107 --> 00:48:28,041
Yes.

749
00:48:31,178 --> 00:48:32,045
Do you want to see her?

750
00:48:33,681 --> 00:48:34,582
Can I just have a minute?

751
00:48:36,049 --> 00:48:36,950
Absolutely.

752
00:48:49,597 --> 00:48:50,865
It was kind of messed up

753
00:48:50,998 --> 00:48:52,933
that I had to relive
my high school musical.

754
00:48:53,066 --> 00:48:54,401
Which you kind of nailed.

755
00:48:54,536 --> 00:48:55,804
I did nail, yes.

756
00:48:57,337 --> 00:48:58,372
But it seems really unfair

757
00:48:58,506 --> 00:48:59,406
that you have to relive
the moment

758
00:48:59,541 --> 00:49:00,575
where you're told your mom died.

759
00:49:00,708 --> 00:49:01,810
I'm not reliving this.

760
00:49:02,976 --> 00:49:04,779
This is happening
for the first time.

761
00:49:05,279 --> 00:49:07,414
I wasn't at the hospital
when my mom died.

762
00:49:07,549 --> 00:49:08,783
I avoided it.

763
00:49:09,249 --> 00:49:10,150
Do you know where I went?

764
00:49:12,720 --> 00:49:13,655
Museum?

765
00:49:17,892 --> 00:49:19,493
God, the fucking museum.

766
00:49:20,093 --> 00:49:21,028
Sarah, that's...

767
00:49:21,930 --> 00:49:23,163
That's kind of beautiful.

768
00:49:23,297 --> 00:49:24,866
Your mother's
favorite place in the world.

769
00:49:27,735 --> 00:49:28,603
It's kind of beautiful.

770
00:49:31,739 --> 00:49:32,640
I'm horrible.

771
00:49:33,508 --> 00:49:34,676
Uh, not even close.

772
00:49:34,809 --> 00:49:36,109
I... Then you don't
know me very well.

773
00:49:36,243 --> 00:49:38,312
Actually, not...
You're... You're...

774
00:49:39,379 --> 00:49:42,115
You're magic. You're a lovely,
formidable force,

775
00:49:42,249 --> 00:49:43,417
is what you are.

776
00:49:43,551 --> 00:49:44,418
Listen to me.

777
00:49:46,888 --> 00:49:48,121
I'm a fucking coward.

778
00:49:48,255 --> 00:49:49,524
Nope. You're here now.

779
00:49:49,657 --> 00:49:51,492
-I'm a fucking coward.
-You're here now.

780
00:49:51,626 --> 00:49:52,827
Yeah, but that doesn't,

781
00:49:52,961 --> 00:49:54,863
-it doesn't count now. It's...
-Why not?

782
00:49:54,995 --> 00:49:55,930
Because it...

783
00:49:58,298 --> 00:49:59,634
It's not real!

784
00:50:00,568 --> 00:50:01,769
This isn't real!

785
00:50:01,903 --> 00:50:03,771
Well, it sure as shit...

786
00:50:04,772 --> 00:50:05,707
feels very real.

787
00:50:07,140 --> 00:50:08,041
Every part of it.

788
00:50:09,777 --> 00:50:10,979
David.

789
00:50:11,846 --> 00:50:14,414
I wasn't at the museum
the day my mom died.

790
00:50:14,549 --> 00:50:15,517
I really...

791
00:50:17,117 --> 00:50:19,019
really love that
you thought that,

792
00:50:19,821 --> 00:50:21,088
and I wish it were true, but...

793
00:50:24,358 --> 00:50:25,325
I was...

794
00:50:26,326 --> 00:50:27,762
screwing my professor.

795
00:50:30,999 --> 00:50:32,099
That's what I was doing.

796
00:50:35,068 --> 00:50:36,336
And she died alone.

797
00:50:37,939 --> 00:50:38,840
Mmm.

798
00:50:47,047 --> 00:50:48,315
I better do this.

799
00:52:06,794 --> 00:52:07,762
Dad.

800
00:52:29,851 --> 00:52:31,619
<i>All I'm thinking</i>
<i>about right now</i>

801
00:52:31,753 --> 00:52:34,622
<i>is the time that</i> Big
<i>was supposed to play on TV</i>

802
00:52:34,756 --> 00:52:36,289
<i>one night after swim practice.</i>

803
00:52:37,324 --> 00:52:39,226
<i>And I remember saying to you,</i>

804
00:52:39,359 --> 00:52:42,764
"Mom, what I really want
is to come home

805
00:52:42,897 --> 00:52:44,364
"from swim practice

806
00:52:44,899 --> 00:52:47,467
"and eat mashed potatoes
while I watch <i>Big."</i>

807
00:52:50,138 --> 00:52:51,171
And do you know what you said?

808
00:52:52,907 --> 00:52:54,441
Without hesitation.

809
00:52:54,575 --> 00:52:56,276
Without a hint of annoyance.

810
00:52:57,645 --> 00:52:58,613
You said,

811
00:52:59,446 --> 00:53:01,115
"Of course, sweetheart."

812
00:53:03,518 --> 00:53:05,887
And you must have been so tired.

813
00:53:08,422 --> 00:53:10,992
But you were never
going to say no.

814
00:53:11,125 --> 00:53:14,194
<i>That word just</i>
<i>never crossed your mind.</i>

815
00:53:15,997 --> 00:53:20,034
It was always,
"Of course," with you.

816
00:53:23,738 --> 00:53:24,772
You just...

817
00:53:26,007 --> 00:53:27,008
gave...

818
00:53:28,910 --> 00:53:30,277
so easily.

819
00:54:01,909 --> 00:54:03,243
-Is everything okay?
-Yeah.

820
00:54:04,344 --> 00:54:05,278
Yeah.

821
00:54:09,183 --> 00:54:10,885
No, not really. But...

822
00:54:12,820 --> 00:54:13,721
it's just...

823
00:54:15,890 --> 00:54:16,824
my son.

824
00:54:18,893 --> 00:54:21,996
My son, uh,
was born prematurely.

825
00:54:26,634 --> 00:54:27,735
Well, I'm... I'm...

826
00:54:28,870 --> 00:54:29,971
I'm sure he's gonna be okay.

827
00:54:30,104 --> 00:54:32,272
There's some complications.

828
00:54:32,405 --> 00:54:33,941
We were just told this morning.

829
00:54:34,776 --> 00:54:36,177
What complications?
What's wrong?

830
00:54:37,979 --> 00:54:38,980
His heart.

831
00:54:40,280 --> 00:54:43,350
There's some...
problems with his heart.

832
00:54:43,483 --> 00:54:45,285
It's called PDA.

833
00:54:45,418 --> 00:54:48,455
Patent ductus arter...
something.

834
00:54:50,925 --> 00:54:52,660
Did they say
if it's fatal?

835
00:54:54,629 --> 00:54:55,630
Yeah, it can be.

836
00:54:57,098 --> 00:54:59,167
He'll... Hey, he'll survive.

837
00:55:01,135 --> 00:55:02,302
Well, thank you for saying that.

838
00:55:07,742 --> 00:55:11,444
Seeing my...
son trapped in that incubator.

839
00:55:11,579 --> 00:55:13,915
If he dies in there
and if I'm not able to hold him,

840
00:55:14,048 --> 00:55:15,683
I don't know what...
What we'll do.

841
00:55:17,618 --> 00:55:19,620
It's gonna be all right, Dad.
It's gonna be all right.

842
00:55:20,353 --> 00:55:21,321
"Dad"?

843
00:55:22,957 --> 00:55:25,492
You... Well,
you're a dad, right?

844
00:55:26,027 --> 00:55:27,628
Actually, I am.

845
00:55:30,198 --> 00:55:32,465
We tried to have a child
for a long time.

846
00:55:33,466 --> 00:55:34,802
And then we were fine with it.

847
00:55:35,335 --> 00:55:37,404
And then she got pregnant.

848
00:55:38,306 --> 00:55:39,372
At 40.

849
00:55:40,107 --> 00:55:41,175
And the next thing you know,

850
00:55:42,877 --> 00:55:44,212
our little David was born.

851
00:55:46,781 --> 00:55:47,748
Do you have children?

852
00:55:49,250 --> 00:55:50,184
No, I don't.

853
00:55:52,753 --> 00:55:56,157
My friends tried to explain
what it's like, but...

854
00:55:56,791 --> 00:55:57,692
it's impossible.

855
00:55:58,626 --> 00:55:59,527
And annoying.

856
00:56:01,329 --> 00:56:04,364
The minute that I saw my boy...

857
00:56:06,167 --> 00:56:07,500
my world changed.

858
00:56:11,172 --> 00:56:12,073
Do you think...

859
00:56:13,507 --> 00:56:16,077
that you'll tell him
about all this?

860
00:56:16,210 --> 00:56:17,477
You know,
with the complications.

861
00:56:19,379 --> 00:56:21,381
My wife and I made a promise.

862
00:56:21,515 --> 00:56:23,551
If he survives,
we'll do everything we can

863
00:56:23,684 --> 00:56:25,452
to protect him
from shite like this.

864
00:56:26,187 --> 00:56:27,088
Excuse my language.

865
00:56:28,990 --> 00:56:30,024
Nah, nah.

866
00:56:31,025 --> 00:56:32,059
We won't tell him.

867
00:56:32,193 --> 00:56:34,896
He'll only know
that he was perfect,

868
00:56:35,428 --> 00:56:37,365
and that he's everything
we ever wanted and hoped for.

869
00:56:37,497 --> 00:56:38,431
That he's...

870
00:56:39,867 --> 00:56:40,801
Special.

871
00:56:44,705 --> 00:56:46,439
-Yeah, special.
-Mr. Longley.

872
00:56:47,608 --> 00:56:49,143
Your wife is asking for you.

873
00:56:49,610 --> 00:56:50,711
I need to go.
Thanks for listening.

874
00:56:50,845 --> 00:56:51,846
Yeah.

875
00:56:53,748 --> 00:56:54,715
Hey.

876
00:56:54,849 --> 00:56:55,883
Yeah?

877
00:56:56,384 --> 00:56:57,417
You're a good dad.

878
00:57:00,254 --> 00:57:01,188
That's all I want.

879
00:57:01,756 --> 00:57:02,690
Just a chance.

880
00:57:18,205 --> 00:57:19,472
I met a boy, Mom.

881
00:57:22,610 --> 00:57:24,412
I really wish
I could talk to you about it.

882
00:57:26,647 --> 00:57:27,949
He's here now.

883
00:57:31,052 --> 00:57:32,320
I think if I let him,

884
00:57:34,055 --> 00:57:35,523
he might always be here.

885
00:57:52,006 --> 00:57:53,240
Who are you?

886
00:57:57,477 --> 00:57:58,579
I'm the guy who buys gifts

887
00:57:58,713 --> 00:58:00,781
because he doesn't know
what else to do.

888
00:58:05,152 --> 00:58:06,654
The Renoir painting from before.

889
00:58:06,787 --> 00:58:08,823
That's my mom's
favorite painting.

890
00:58:08,956 --> 00:58:11,292
Hmm. It's a beautiful painting.

891
00:58:11,425 --> 00:58:12,660
Yeah.

892
00:58:13,127 --> 00:58:15,629
She always liked how helpful
a girl who's not playing is.

893
00:58:15,763 --> 00:58:17,031
She's like turning the pages.

894
00:58:17,965 --> 00:58:20,167
It's like a selfless act.

895
00:58:22,103 --> 00:58:23,204
Your mom sounds cool.

896
00:58:26,874 --> 00:58:29,377
You know, we're not taking
any of this with us.

897
00:58:30,177 --> 00:58:31,078
Oh, sorry, you...

898
00:58:32,680 --> 00:58:33,848
thought these were for you?

899
00:58:34,849 --> 00:58:36,917
Uh, they're for my girlfriend.

900
00:58:37,818 --> 00:58:39,186
Oh, for your girlfriend?

901
00:58:39,320 --> 00:58:40,354
Yeah.

902
00:58:41,322 --> 00:58:42,223
She's really...

903
00:58:43,457 --> 00:58:44,392
bad for me.

904
00:58:46,727 --> 00:58:47,595
It's what I go for.

905
00:58:48,662 --> 00:58:49,597
Fuck her.

906
00:58:53,801 --> 00:58:54,869
-We will be taking this guy.
-Yeah?

907
00:58:55,002 --> 00:58:56,003
-Yeah. See, yeah...
-All right, yeah?

908
00:58:56,137 --> 00:58:57,972
...he's just perfect.

909
00:59:10,217 --> 00:59:11,152
Hold your breath.

910
00:59:12,787 --> 00:59:14,088
What?

911
00:59:15,289 --> 00:59:17,691
My mom would do this thing when
we were in the car together.

912
00:59:17,825 --> 00:59:19,260
She would shout,
"Hold your breath," randomly,

913
00:59:19,393 --> 00:59:20,394
and then we would
hold our breath

914
00:59:20,529 --> 00:59:22,196
and see who can do it
the longest.

915
00:59:25,199 --> 00:59:26,934
-Hold your breath.
-Okay.

916
00:59:39,046 --> 00:59:40,081
You win.

917
00:59:43,017 --> 00:59:44,318
I didn't take a big enough...

918
00:59:49,390 --> 00:59:51,158
Sarah, you're gonna pass out,

919
00:59:51,292 --> 00:59:53,160
and I'm gonna have to give you
the kiss of life.

920
00:59:57,264 --> 00:59:58,466
Ah.

921
00:59:58,933 --> 01:00:00,201
She wants me
to give her the kiss of life.

922
01:00:05,873 --> 01:00:07,208
I think I just saw God.

923
01:00:09,076 --> 01:00:10,744
<i>Congratulations,</i>
<i>Sarah and David.</i>

924
01:00:10,878 --> 01:00:12,046
<i>You've earned a break.</i>

925
01:00:13,013 --> 01:00:15,950
<i>You'll arrive at the scenic</i>
<i>overlook in 21 minutes.</i>

926
01:00:17,051 --> 01:00:18,385
Yay. A break.

927
01:00:20,254 --> 01:00:21,288
What's happening?

928
01:00:21,422 --> 01:00:22,756
I am gonna change.

929
01:00:27,728 --> 01:00:29,263
Okay, no peeking.

930
01:00:29,396 --> 01:00:30,498
Yeah, of course.

931
01:00:30,631 --> 01:00:31,799
Okay, but if I move the mirror,

932
01:00:31,932 --> 01:00:33,434
it's just to see
out of the back of the car.

933
01:00:33,568 --> 01:00:35,503
And maybe,
just a little bit of your face.

934
01:00:35,636 --> 01:00:36,538
There you are.

935
01:00:38,973 --> 01:00:40,441
I don't know
if I trust the angle

936
01:00:40,575 --> 01:00:42,109
of that mirror right now.

937
01:00:42,243 --> 01:00:43,777
Just the face.
Just the face. Just the face.

938
01:00:45,580 --> 01:00:47,114
Hey, can I tell you
something I just thought about?

939
01:00:47,248 --> 01:00:48,282
Yeah.

940
01:00:48,415 --> 01:00:50,784
And I've never told anyone this.

941
01:00:50,918 --> 01:00:53,154
When I was a kid, my mom left.

942
01:00:55,456 --> 01:00:56,525
Oh.

943
01:00:56,657 --> 01:00:57,925
Yeah, no, it's...
I mean, it's fine.

944
01:00:58,058 --> 01:00:59,460
She came back.
She wasn't gone long.

945
01:00:59,594 --> 01:01:03,097
But the strange thing was my dad
never said a word about it.

946
01:01:03,464 --> 01:01:05,933
You know, I kind of...
I'd forgotten it.

947
01:01:06,066 --> 01:01:07,168
Oh.

948
01:01:07,301 --> 01:01:09,103
Yeah. Yeah, I was small, and...

949
01:01:10,237 --> 01:01:11,705
I knew it wasn't good.

950
01:01:13,841 --> 01:01:15,109
I'm sorry.

951
01:01:15,242 --> 01:01:16,977
I know I said my parents
always worry about me,

952
01:01:17,111 --> 01:01:20,881
but I actually always...
I always worry about my dad.

953
01:01:21,916 --> 01:01:22,850
Yeah.

954
01:01:24,151 --> 01:01:25,953
Well, thank you
for sharing that with me.

955
01:01:26,086 --> 01:01:27,221
Well,
thank you for letting me.

956
01:01:30,424 --> 01:01:31,959
Do you think life is short?

957
01:01:32,092 --> 01:01:32,993
Mmm.

958
01:01:33,961 --> 01:01:35,196
Go on.

959
01:01:36,063 --> 01:01:38,432
I don't know. It's something
I've been... thinking,

960
01:01:38,567 --> 01:01:40,201
and I just wanted to hear
my mouth say it.

961
01:01:42,571 --> 01:01:43,538
I don't think life is short.

962
01:01:45,072 --> 01:01:46,106
People say it, you know.

963
01:01:46,240 --> 01:01:47,875
"Life is short. Have fun."
But...

964
01:01:48,742 --> 01:01:50,411
I have to say, for the last
ten years or so,

965
01:01:52,046 --> 01:01:53,714
life has felt
pretty damn long to me.

966
01:01:56,250 --> 01:01:57,218
I agree.

967
01:01:57,918 --> 01:01:59,286
-You do?
-Yeah.

968
01:01:59,420 --> 01:02:01,288
Life only feels short
when you're moving forward

969
01:02:01,422 --> 01:02:02,890
with something
that you don't want to end.

970
01:02:03,592 --> 01:02:04,693
Right. Yeah, yeah.

971
01:02:09,531 --> 01:02:11,566
I haven't moved forward
with something in a long time.

972
01:02:17,304 --> 01:02:18,205
And how does...

973
01:02:19,674 --> 01:02:20,542
How does it feel now?

974
01:02:29,149 --> 01:02:31,285
It's may be feeling
a smidge shorter.

975
01:02:36,056 --> 01:02:37,124
Yeah.

976
01:02:39,426 --> 01:02:40,394
Yeah.

977
01:02:49,604 --> 01:02:50,838
Okay,
how is this a break?

978
01:03:17,131 --> 01:03:19,967
Are we looking down
at ourselves right now?

979
01:03:20,467 --> 01:03:21,402
I think so.

980
01:03:22,970 --> 01:03:25,573
-This is so...
-Beautiful.

981
01:03:27,041 --> 01:03:29,410
I was gonna say strange,
but yeah, that too.

982
01:03:29,544 --> 01:03:30,779
Beautifully strange.

983
01:03:30,911 --> 01:03:32,813
It's strangely beautiful.

984
01:03:36,183 --> 01:03:37,117
Hmm.

985
01:03:43,525 --> 01:03:45,326
When was the last time you were
at a wedding with someone?

986
01:03:47,328 --> 01:03:48,395
Oh.

987
01:03:48,530 --> 01:03:50,497
It's... been a while.

988
01:03:53,133 --> 01:03:54,068
Same.

989
01:03:55,537 --> 01:03:56,705
And what do you think
would have happened

990
01:03:56,837 --> 01:03:58,339
if we had gone
to that wedding together?

991
01:04:04,713 --> 01:04:05,747
Hmm.

992
01:04:07,615 --> 01:04:11,118
Well, I guess we would have
known we were together

993
01:04:11,251 --> 01:04:13,287
-and that would have been...
-A comfort.

994
01:04:14,121 --> 01:04:15,055
Yeah.

995
01:04:19,828 --> 01:04:21,663
I never liked coming
to these things alone.

996
01:04:23,631 --> 01:04:25,999
At some point, you would have
gotten me a drink...

997
01:04:26,133 --> 01:04:27,368
<i>Yeah.</i>

998
01:04:27,501 --> 01:04:28,670
<i>...and</i>
<i>I would have felt...</i>

999
01:04:33,340 --> 01:04:34,576
Yeah.

1000
01:04:35,042 --> 01:04:36,343
-You would have felt what?
-I would have felt...

1001
01:04:37,679 --> 01:04:39,547
-taken care of.
-You would have been.

1002
01:04:42,216 --> 01:04:43,183
Yeah.

1003
01:04:45,754 --> 01:04:46,688
What's your drink?

1004
01:04:47,722 --> 01:04:48,757
White wine.

1005
01:04:48,889 --> 01:04:49,858
Dry.

1006
01:04:49,990 --> 01:04:51,024
Very dry.

1007
01:04:51,158 --> 01:04:53,894
-Like rocks.
-Like dryer.

1008
01:04:59,500 --> 01:05:01,068
Would we have danced
at this wedding?

1009
01:05:01,536 --> 01:05:03,538
-You don't dance at weddings.
-I do in this scenario.

1010
01:05:03,671 --> 01:05:05,105
-Oh. Okay.
-Yeah.

1011
01:05:05,239 --> 01:05:06,541
We're rewriting the rulebooks.

1012
01:05:06,674 --> 01:05:08,208
Then we would have danced.

1013
01:05:08,342 --> 01:05:09,544
<i>God, it sounds like</i>

1014
01:05:09,677 --> 01:05:11,044
<i>we're having a good time</i>
<i>at this wedding.</i>

1015
01:05:11,178 --> 01:05:12,714
<i>God, we're having</i>
<i>a great time at this wedding.</i>

1016
01:05:12,847 --> 01:05:13,882
<i>Does it make you nervous?</i>

1017
01:05:14,014 --> 01:05:15,215
<i>How lovely a time we're having?</i>

1018
01:05:15,349 --> 01:05:16,417
A little.

1019
01:05:18,385 --> 01:05:19,687
<i>-You?</i>
<i>-Very much.</i>

1020
01:05:20,555 --> 01:05:21,556
<i>But I'm okay with it.</i>

1021
01:05:22,990 --> 01:05:24,559
Why?

1022
01:05:25,426 --> 01:05:27,027
Because I prefer
to feel nervous with you

1023
01:05:27,161 --> 01:05:28,429
than feel nothing alone.

1024
01:05:30,532 --> 01:05:31,566
That simple.

1025
01:05:45,446 --> 01:05:46,947
Are you taking it all in
this time?

1026
01:06:22,584 --> 01:06:24,184
<i>You have arrived</i>
<i>at your next stop.</i>

1027
01:06:26,420 --> 01:06:27,789
Shite.

1028
01:06:27,922 --> 01:06:30,190
-Do you know that door?
-Yeah. You?

1029
01:06:31,458 --> 01:06:33,260
Yeah, I used to go there
all the time.

1030
01:06:34,629 --> 01:06:35,597
Me, too.

1031
01:06:37,164 --> 01:06:38,499
I don't
wanna go in there.

1032
01:06:38,633 --> 01:06:39,667
Me neither.

1033
01:06:39,801 --> 01:06:41,168
Pass.

1034
01:06:41,301 --> 01:06:43,136
<i>You have arrived</i>
<i>at your next stop.</i>

1035
01:06:47,775 --> 01:06:49,142
I think now
would be a good time to tell you

1036
01:06:49,276 --> 01:06:50,177
I was engaged once.

1037
01:06:52,547 --> 01:06:53,748
Okay.

1038
01:06:54,516 --> 01:06:56,016
I think now would be
a good time to tell you

1039
01:06:56,149 --> 01:06:57,719
I'm a fucking monster.

1040
01:07:32,620 --> 01:07:33,588
All right.

1041
01:07:34,454 --> 01:07:35,557
Yeah.

1042
01:07:39,894 --> 01:07:40,862
Hey.

1043
01:07:41,863 --> 01:07:42,830
Here.

1044
01:07:47,434 --> 01:07:48,368
I'm so sorry.

1045
01:07:50,203 --> 01:07:52,139
Two people saying sorry
at the end of a relationship.

1046
01:07:52,272 --> 01:07:53,875
Well, it doesn't get
more boring than that.

1047
01:07:59,914 --> 01:08:01,381
Are you sure
you wanna go through with this?

1048
01:08:03,350 --> 01:08:04,752
Yeah. Yeah, I'm sure.

1049
01:08:05,319 --> 01:08:06,621
Because...

1050
01:08:07,287 --> 01:08:09,057
And I know this might make me
sound weak or whatever.

1051
01:08:09,189 --> 01:08:10,658
-No, you're not weak.
-It's fine.

1052
01:08:11,224 --> 01:08:12,492
But just say the word, and...

1053
01:08:14,028 --> 01:08:15,563
we can just forget about this.

1054
01:08:16,263 --> 01:08:17,899
And you can put that ring
right back on my finger,

1055
01:08:18,032 --> 01:08:19,132
and we can just move on.

1056
01:08:20,068 --> 01:08:21,101
Together.

1057
01:08:21,234 --> 01:08:22,235
You're gonna love this.

1058
01:08:22,737 --> 01:08:24,204
I, uh, upgraded our room.

1059
01:08:26,708 --> 01:08:27,642
Check it out.

1060
01:08:28,342 --> 01:08:29,744
Oh, wow.

1061
01:08:29,877 --> 01:08:31,278
-It's gonna be so great.
-It's lovely.

1062
01:08:31,411 --> 01:08:33,447
I also made
a reservation at your...

1063
01:08:33,581 --> 01:08:34,882
your favorite restaurant.

1064
01:08:35,016 --> 01:08:36,383
-Great.
-Yeah. And I made sure

1065
01:08:36,517 --> 01:08:39,921
they had the very, very,
very dry white wine.

1066
01:08:40,420 --> 01:08:41,823
-Thank you.
-Drier than dirt dry.

1067
01:08:43,290 --> 01:08:45,158
Why didn't we work?
Why did this end?

1068
01:08:45,927 --> 01:08:46,894
Just...

1069
01:08:48,663 --> 01:08:49,597
wasn't meant to be.

1070
01:08:51,164 --> 01:08:52,299
That's such bullshit.

1071
01:08:53,935 --> 01:08:55,268
"Wasn't meant to be"?

1072
01:08:55,402 --> 01:08:56,671
Wait, you... you didn't say that
when this happened.

1073
01:08:56,804 --> 01:08:58,973
Why did you lose
interest in me, David?

1074
01:08:59,107 --> 01:09:00,541
You didn't say that either.

1075
01:09:00,675 --> 01:09:01,876
...thing where I pick out
your outfit for the night.

1076
01:09:02,010 --> 01:09:02,944
I leave you tonight.

1077
01:09:14,088 --> 01:09:14,989
What do you mean?

1078
01:09:15,857 --> 01:09:17,190
When you're asleep,

1079
01:09:17,324 --> 01:09:18,325
I leave you
in the middle of the night.

1080
01:09:20,962 --> 01:09:22,295
And when you wake up...

1081
01:09:23,163 --> 01:09:25,533
you have no idea
where I am, and you're...

1082
01:09:26,067 --> 01:09:29,436
worried sick, and you text
and you call and...

1083
01:09:31,773 --> 01:09:32,940
I block your number,

1084
01:09:34,341 --> 01:09:35,643
and you never
hear from me again.

1085
01:09:38,178 --> 01:09:40,213
-Tell me why you lost interest?
-I don't know.

1086
01:09:41,015 --> 01:09:42,050
Jesus Christ!

1087
01:09:42,182 --> 01:09:43,283
When did you start
stabbing people?

1088
01:09:44,351 --> 01:09:46,654
You chased after me so hard.

1089
01:09:46,788 --> 01:09:48,523
Won me over.
When you finally had me,

1090
01:09:48,656 --> 01:09:50,390
-what happened?
-I was underwhelmed.

1091
01:09:50,525 --> 01:09:51,993
-What happened?
-I was overwhelmed.

1092
01:09:52,126 --> 01:09:53,828
-Felt disappointed.
-Didn't wanna be disappointing.

1093
01:09:53,961 --> 01:09:55,429
Thought of coming home to you
every day made me...

1094
01:09:55,563 --> 01:09:56,430
Break out into hives.

1095
01:09:58,032 --> 01:09:59,266
-I wasn't happy with you.
-Or me.

1096
01:09:59,399 --> 01:10:00,835
-Or us.
-Blah, blah, blah.

1097
01:10:00,968 --> 01:10:02,870
-Blah, blah, blah. Dig...
-Deeper.

1098
01:10:03,004 --> 01:10:04,539
I thought we just dug
fairly fucking deep.

1099
01:10:05,173 --> 01:10:06,107
Okay.

1100
01:10:07,875 --> 01:10:08,843
I'll go.

1101
01:10:10,011 --> 01:10:12,279
At first, I was really into you.

1102
01:10:14,347 --> 01:10:15,550
I thought I'd met my match.

1103
01:10:15,683 --> 01:10:17,618
Someone just like me.

1104
01:10:17,752 --> 01:10:21,055
Someone who wanted
to have fun and not care.

1105
01:10:21,823 --> 01:10:22,990
Someone...

1106
01:10:23,691 --> 01:10:25,626
who knew that
this was all bullshit,

1107
01:10:25,760 --> 01:10:27,061
and that it wasn't gonna last.

1108
01:10:27,962 --> 01:10:29,197
And then you changed.

1109
01:10:29,329 --> 01:10:30,865
You started to care.

1110
01:10:31,566 --> 01:10:32,600
Really care.

1111
01:10:32,734 --> 01:10:34,202
Because I fell in love with you.

1112
01:10:34,334 --> 01:10:36,104
Yes! That!
I didn't ask for that.

1113
01:10:36,236 --> 01:10:37,337
It was too much.

1114
01:10:38,472 --> 01:10:39,941
I loved you too much?

1115
01:10:40,074 --> 01:10:41,709
Yes. Yeah.

1116
01:10:42,309 --> 01:10:43,243
No.

1117
01:10:43,911 --> 01:10:45,046
Yes. Yeah.

1118
01:10:50,551 --> 01:10:53,487
So you leave me
because I love you.

1119
01:10:53,621 --> 01:10:55,322
No, I leave you because...

1120
01:11:00,695 --> 01:11:02,930
Because you love some version
of me that's not me.

1121
01:11:03,698 --> 01:11:04,632
And you don't...

1122
01:11:06,299 --> 01:11:07,235
You don't know me.

1123
01:11:08,970 --> 01:11:11,572
You never really knew me.

1124
01:11:13,040 --> 01:11:14,242
And that's my fault?

1125
01:11:25,520 --> 01:11:26,386
And what about you?

1126
01:11:27,889 --> 01:11:28,823
Hard pass.

1127
01:11:36,230 --> 01:11:37,165
I, um...

1128
01:11:39,033 --> 01:11:40,902
I genuinely believed
that I could make you happy.

1129
01:11:42,369 --> 01:11:44,337
And that's all I wanted.

1130
01:11:44,471 --> 01:11:46,140
That hope is everything to me.

1131
01:11:47,208 --> 01:11:49,243
Means that every day
that I'm pursuing you and...

1132
01:11:50,778 --> 01:11:52,412
I'm pleasing you is beautiful.

1133
01:11:52,547 --> 01:11:54,649
You know, it's meaningful
until I have you.

1134
01:11:54,782 --> 01:11:56,517
And then, it all...

1135
01:11:58,519 --> 01:11:59,687
becomes meaningless.

1136
01:12:03,758 --> 01:12:05,293
And then, I start feeling...

1137
01:12:06,093 --> 01:12:07,327
myself again.

1138
01:12:09,263 --> 01:12:10,397
You know, the me that I was...

1139
01:12:11,364 --> 01:12:12,300
before we met.

1140
01:12:13,500 --> 01:12:17,004
Except this time,
I'm more tired.

1141
01:12:17,672 --> 01:12:19,740
And then I wake up one morning,
and I...

1142
01:12:20,340 --> 01:12:22,910
I'm about as fucking empty
as I have ever been.

1143
01:12:25,847 --> 01:12:26,981
And...

1144
01:12:27,480 --> 01:12:28,683
you'll never make me happy.

1145
01:12:32,854 --> 01:12:33,955
That's very, very cruel.

1146
01:12:35,957 --> 01:12:37,058
No one's good enough for you.

1147
01:12:55,109 --> 01:12:56,043
<i>Deer incoming.</i>

1148
01:12:56,177 --> 01:12:57,178
What?

1149
01:12:58,913 --> 01:13:00,047
Oh, shit!

1150
01:13:29,844 --> 01:13:30,778
Come on.

1151
01:13:31,679 --> 01:13:32,713
Crap.

1152
01:13:34,248 --> 01:13:35,249
Crap.

1153
01:13:35,383 --> 01:13:36,449
-Sabotage!
-Huh.

1154
01:13:40,755 --> 01:13:42,556
You know how to fix
totaled cars?

1155
01:13:42,690 --> 01:13:43,557
I do not.

1156
01:13:47,228 --> 01:13:48,763
How about burning cars?

1157
01:13:49,429 --> 01:13:50,598
I do not.

1158
01:13:51,599 --> 01:13:52,600
Well...

1159
01:13:53,601 --> 01:13:54,969
we're good at destroying things.

1160
01:13:56,938 --> 01:13:57,872
Apparently.

1161
01:14:11,385 --> 01:14:13,287
-David?
-Yeah?

1162
01:14:16,924 --> 01:14:17,825
Let's not do this.

1163
01:14:18,426 --> 01:14:19,360
Do what?

1164
01:14:20,294 --> 01:14:21,195
This. Let's...

1165
01:14:25,833 --> 01:14:27,301
I don't want to be the girl
sitting in a café,

1166
01:14:27,435 --> 01:14:28,970
holding a ring,

1167
01:14:29,103 --> 01:14:30,503
wondering when
you lost interest in me.

1168
01:14:35,576 --> 01:14:36,744
I don't want you to be the guy

1169
01:14:36,877 --> 01:14:38,079
that I leave
in the middle of the night.

1170
01:14:38,746 --> 01:14:39,680
Let's just...

1171
01:14:41,382 --> 01:14:43,250
end this before
we hurt each other.

1172
01:14:43,384 --> 01:14:45,119
Why are you so certain
we're gonna hurt each other?

1173
01:14:49,323 --> 01:14:51,459
Were you not paying attention
back there in the café?

1174
01:14:51,592 --> 01:14:53,127
That... that's just who we are.

1175
01:14:53,260 --> 01:14:54,595
That's who we were.

1176
01:14:54,729 --> 01:14:56,697
It doesn't mean
it has to be who we are, Sarah.

1177
01:14:56,998 --> 01:14:58,032
I mean, this whole journey...

1178
01:14:59,734 --> 01:15:02,470
I think it's a... it's a chance,
you know, for us to be open.

1179
01:15:04,038 --> 01:15:06,040
I mean, life is...
Life is better when you're open.

1180
01:15:07,775 --> 01:15:08,843
What does that even mean?

1181
01:15:10,478 --> 01:15:12,146
It means... It means... Um...

1182
01:15:18,619 --> 01:15:19,720
It means, I love you.

1183
01:15:19,854 --> 01:15:20,821
What?

1184
01:15:23,124 --> 01:15:25,059
Yeah. I love you.

1185
01:15:26,293 --> 01:15:27,862
-No, you don't.
-Yeah, I do.

1186
01:15:28,362 --> 01:15:29,530
-You don't. You don't...
-I'm sorry, I do.

1187
01:15:29,663 --> 01:15:30,564
You don't know me.

1188
01:15:36,203 --> 01:15:37,171
You...

1189
01:15:38,439 --> 01:15:40,641
-You don't.
-Yes, I do. I know that you...

1190
01:15:43,010 --> 01:15:44,478
I know that you feel like shit
that you weren't there

1191
01:15:44,612 --> 01:15:45,479
when your mother died.

1192
01:15:47,348 --> 01:15:49,183
I know that you've never been
able to forgive yourself for it.

1193
01:15:49,316 --> 01:15:51,318
I know that you cheat,

1194
01:15:51,452 --> 01:15:53,154
so no one else
can hurt you first.

1195
01:15:53,287 --> 01:15:55,156
And that you leave,
you know, when you feel like

1196
01:15:55,289 --> 01:15:58,192
you're being loved too much.

1197
01:16:05,833 --> 01:16:06,734
I know you, Sarah.

1198
01:16:12,006 --> 01:16:14,108
But I also know that you love
eating fast-food cheeseburgers,

1199
01:16:14,241 --> 01:16:16,243
and I know that you love
traveling alone like I do.

1200
01:16:17,178 --> 01:16:18,212
I see you, Sarah.

1201
01:16:19,947 --> 01:16:20,915
I see you.

1202
01:16:24,018 --> 01:16:25,219
And I love you.

1203
01:16:25,753 --> 01:16:28,422
And not some idea of you.
I love you, all of you.

1204
01:16:32,760 --> 01:16:34,095
Maybe you feel that way
right now,

1205
01:16:34,228 --> 01:16:35,564
but what about tomorrow?

1206
01:16:35,696 --> 01:16:37,264
What about next week?

1207
01:16:37,398 --> 01:16:39,733
What about next month,
once you...

1208
01:16:40,935 --> 01:16:42,069
Once you have me?

1209
01:16:42,203 --> 01:16:43,237
Really have me?

1210
01:16:45,005 --> 01:16:47,308
-Then what?
-Then we have a cup of tea.

1211
01:16:48,709 --> 01:16:49,877
We keep it...

1212
01:16:50,010 --> 01:16:51,946
We... we lie on the grass,
we read books.

1213
01:16:54,115 --> 01:16:56,050
We dance, Sarah.
We just... We dance.

1214
01:16:56,183 --> 01:16:57,918
I mean, that life
that we imagined up there.

1215
01:16:58,052 --> 01:16:59,453
-It was a fantasy, David.
-I refuse to believe that.

1216
01:16:59,588 --> 01:17:00,821
It's a thing we made up.

1217
01:17:04,091 --> 01:17:05,659
I refuse to believe that.

1218
01:17:05,793 --> 01:17:08,329
Because this
is what you do. You do this.

1219
01:17:08,462 --> 01:17:10,831
You, like, relentlessly
chase after someone,

1220
01:17:10,965 --> 01:17:12,633
because you think
they're gonna make you happy.

1221
01:17:12,766 --> 01:17:14,435
And then when you get them,
you don't want them anymore.

1222
01:17:14,569 --> 01:17:16,504
No, no, no, no. Yeah,
I've done that in the past.

1223
01:17:16,637 --> 01:17:17,606
But that's not
what this is about.

1224
01:17:17,738 --> 01:17:18,639
This isn't about
the chase, Sarah.

1225
01:17:18,772 --> 01:17:19,840
It's not about using you

1226
01:17:19,974 --> 01:17:21,775
as a distraction
from my bullshit.

1227
01:17:23,512 --> 01:17:25,312
It's not even about being happy.
It's about...

1228
01:17:28,082 --> 01:17:29,783
It's about believing.

1229
01:17:29,917 --> 01:17:32,554
That's what this is about.
For the first time, maybe, ever.

1230
01:17:32,686 --> 01:17:34,188
It's about believing
that it's possible.

1231
01:17:35,524 --> 01:17:36,490
What is?

1232
01:17:39,894 --> 01:17:40,794
To share a life.

1233
01:17:48,002 --> 01:17:51,038
It's just...
not worth the risk for me.

1234
01:17:53,040 --> 01:17:54,074
I'm sorry.

1235
01:17:59,380 --> 01:18:00,314
I mean, it's...

1236
01:18:09,690 --> 01:18:10,625
It's okay.

1237
01:18:12,793 --> 01:18:13,727
I don't want to upset you.

1238
01:18:15,095 --> 01:18:16,130
It's okay.

1239
01:18:54,501 --> 01:18:55,704
Thanks for the clothes.

1240
01:18:57,672 --> 01:18:59,406
I, uh...

1241
01:19:00,341 --> 01:19:03,277
I fixed your exploded car.

1242
01:19:04,646 --> 01:19:05,746
How?

1243
01:19:06,548 --> 01:19:07,781
It happens more than you think.

1244
01:19:09,049 --> 01:19:10,251
Why did you have to fix it?

1245
01:19:11,118 --> 01:19:15,256
Because there's more to do,
isn't there?

1246
01:19:20,094 --> 01:19:20,995
Yeah.

1247
01:19:22,631 --> 01:19:26,900
These are a gift
from the car rental agency.

1248
01:19:27,034 --> 01:19:27,968
But it's not raining.

1249
01:19:33,608 --> 01:19:34,676
-Okay.
-Okay.

1250
01:19:47,656 --> 01:19:49,423
<i>You'll arrive</i>
<i>at Kiki's Travel Plaza</i>

1251
01:19:49,557 --> 01:19:50,659
<i>in 21 miles.</i>

1252
01:20:15,617 --> 01:20:16,917
<i>Drop off Sarah.</i>

1253
01:21:13,273 --> 01:21:14,709
<i>Sarah,</i>
<i>are you ready to continue</i>

1254
01:21:14,843 --> 01:21:16,678
<i>your big, bold,</i>
<i>beautiful journey?</i>

1255
01:21:17,878 --> 01:21:18,847
Uh...

1256
01:21:21,048 --> 01:21:22,082
No. I...

1257
01:21:23,518 --> 01:21:24,451
I'm done.

1258
01:21:25,352 --> 01:21:26,588
I'm done.

1259
01:21:27,221 --> 01:21:31,191
<i>You can do this.</i>
<i>In 500 feet, take exit 57.</i>

1260
01:21:31,693 --> 01:21:34,094
I said I'm done, motherfucker.

1261
01:21:34,228 --> 01:21:35,530
I'm done.

1262
01:21:35,663 --> 01:21:37,064
<i>Sarah, come on.</i>

1263
01:21:38,165 --> 01:21:40,602
<i>Take the next exit, 58B, and...</i>

1264
01:21:40,735 --> 01:21:41,703
No.

1265
01:21:42,871 --> 01:21:44,104
<i>Recalculating.</i>

1266
01:21:45,439 --> 01:21:47,742
<i>Come on, Sarah.</i>
<i>Let's finish this out.</i>

1267
01:21:48,909 --> 01:21:52,146
<i>In 1.5 miles, take exit 59-A.</i>

1268
01:21:52,279 --> 01:21:53,247
Shut up!

1269
01:21:54,281 --> 01:21:55,449
Shut the fuck up!

1270
01:21:58,952 --> 01:22:02,590
<i>In 1.5 miles,</i>
<i>take exit 59-A.</i>

1271
01:22:06,795 --> 01:22:07,762
Thanks, I just...

1272
01:22:09,564 --> 01:22:11,064
I just need to go home.

1273
01:22:11,198 --> 01:22:12,299
I just wanna go home.

1274
01:22:14,368 --> 01:22:15,469
<i>All right, Sarah.</i>

1275
01:22:16,236 --> 01:22:18,405
<i>You'll reach home</i>
<i>in one hour and 33 minutes...</i>

1276
01:22:18,540 --> 01:22:19,908
-Okay.
<i>-...with normal traffic.</i>

1277
01:22:21,275 --> 01:22:22,276
Thank you.

1278
01:22:26,514 --> 01:22:27,715
<i>Recalculating.</i>

1279
01:22:29,249 --> 01:22:30,417
I just wanna go home.

1280
01:22:31,251 --> 01:22:32,520
<i>All right, David.</i>

1281
01:22:33,287 --> 01:22:35,456
<i>You'll reach home</i>
<i>in one hour and 33 minutes</i>

1282
01:22:35,590 --> 01:22:37,257
<i>-with normal traffic.</i>
-Thank you.

1283
01:22:51,706 --> 01:22:52,774
<i>You are home.</i>

1284
01:22:58,278 --> 01:23:00,013
Wrong home, asshole.

1285
01:23:18,499 --> 01:23:23,337
<i>There's a bug like an angel</i>

1286
01:23:23,470 --> 01:23:24,506
Fuck.

1287
01:23:24,639 --> 01:23:27,074
<i>Stuck to the bottom</i>

1288
01:23:27,207 --> 01:23:32,881
<i>Of my glass</i>
<i>With a little bit left</i>

1289
01:23:36,016 --> 01:23:39,587
<i>As I got older</i>

1290
01:23:39,721 --> 01:23:43,558
<i>I learned I'm a drinker</i>

1291
01:23:44,324 --> 01:23:49,898
<i>Sometimes a drink</i>
<i>Feels like family</i>

1292
01:23:50,598 --> 01:23:57,104
<i>Family</i>

1293
01:24:01,475 --> 01:24:04,746
<i>Hey, what's the matter?</i>

1294
01:24:06,346 --> 01:24:07,247
Where'd you go?

1295
01:24:10,384 --> 01:24:13,253
-Uh, for a walk.
-You're wet!

1296
01:24:15,188 --> 01:24:17,224
He's... he's upstairs.

1297
01:24:18,760 --> 01:24:20,427
-Who's upstairs?
-Our son.

1298
01:24:21,629 --> 01:24:24,097
-Our son?
-What's wrong, honey?

1299
01:24:24,699 --> 01:24:25,667
"Honey"?

1300
01:24:27,134 --> 01:24:28,402
Sorry, how old am I?

1301
01:24:29,236 --> 01:24:30,270
You're 57.

1302
01:24:32,306 --> 01:24:33,440
Fifty-seven.

1303
01:24:34,241 --> 01:24:36,778
-What's this all about?
-I'm Dad.

1304
01:24:36,911 --> 01:24:38,445
Yeah, you're his Dad.
And he needs you right now.

1305
01:24:38,580 --> 01:24:40,213
That awful girl crushed him.

1306
01:24:41,549 --> 01:24:44,384
She's not an awful girl, Mom.

1307
01:24:45,753 --> 01:24:46,688
Uh, darling.

1308
01:24:48,088 --> 01:24:50,457
-Just go talk to him.
-Okay.

1309
01:24:50,592 --> 01:24:57,065
<i>Break you right back</i>

1310
01:24:57,699 --> 01:25:03,370
<i>Ooh, ooh</i>

1311
01:25:03,503 --> 01:25:07,775
<i>Ooh, ooh-ooh</i>

1312
01:25:16,383 --> 01:25:20,088
<i>When I'm bent over</i>

1313
01:25:20,220 --> 01:25:23,457
<i>Wishin' it was over</i>

1314
01:25:24,458 --> 01:25:29,831
<i>Makin' all variety of vows</i>

1315
01:25:29,964 --> 01:25:31,766
<i>I'll never keep</i>

1316
01:25:32,600 --> 01:25:36,704
<i>I try to remember</i>

1317
01:25:36,838 --> 01:25:40,508
<i>The wrath of the devil</i>

1318
01:25:40,642 --> 01:25:46,648
<i>Was also given him by God</i>

1319
01:25:47,815 --> 01:25:51,719
<i>Ooh, ooh</i>

1320
01:25:51,853 --> 01:25:55,890
<i>Ooh, ooh</i>

1321
01:25:56,024 --> 01:25:57,959
<i>Ooh</i>

1322
01:26:33,260 --> 01:26:34,162
Mom?

1323
01:26:38,432 --> 01:26:39,499
Mom?

1324
01:26:39,634 --> 01:26:42,003
Oh. Hey, kiddo.

1325
01:26:43,437 --> 01:26:45,173
-Hi.
-You're not dead.

1326
01:26:46,306 --> 01:26:48,509
Well, what the hell
kind of thing is that to say?

1327
01:26:50,845 --> 01:26:51,813
Oh.

1328
01:26:53,181 --> 01:26:54,414
Mom.

1329
01:26:54,549 --> 01:26:55,817
Oh, oh.

1330
01:26:58,285 --> 01:26:59,219
Hi.

1331
01:27:00,688 --> 01:27:03,558
-Everything okay?
-Hey, how old am I?

1332
01:27:05,459 --> 01:27:06,527
Did you hit your head
or something?

1333
01:27:06,661 --> 01:27:07,662
Just, how old?

1334
01:27:10,164 --> 01:27:11,666
You're 12, silly.

1335
01:27:14,401 --> 01:27:15,570
I have
the mashed potatoes ready.

1336
01:27:16,671 --> 01:27:17,605
Let's eat.

1337
01:27:31,719 --> 01:27:32,720
Mom?

1338
01:27:34,055 --> 01:27:36,557
I know how tired you are, but...

1339
01:27:38,458 --> 01:27:39,392
What is it, honey?

1340
01:27:42,130 --> 01:27:43,898
Would you mind
watching a movie with me?

1341
01:27:45,265 --> 01:27:46,167
Of course.

1342
01:27:48,268 --> 01:27:49,837
Do you think
I'd let you watch all alone?

1343
01:28:01,749 --> 01:28:03,416
Jesus. That's pathetic.

1344
01:28:06,453 --> 01:28:07,588
Dad?

1345
01:28:10,490 --> 01:28:11,458
Dad.

1346
01:28:16,731 --> 01:28:17,665
Yeah.

1347
01:28:19,133 --> 01:28:21,536
I'm your... dad.

1348
01:28:23,470 --> 01:28:24,839
Are you disappointed in me?

1349
01:28:27,175 --> 01:28:28,375
No.

1350
01:28:29,110 --> 01:28:30,011
No, I'm... I'm...

1351
01:28:31,344 --> 01:28:32,280
I'm sorry you're hurting.

1352
01:28:34,048 --> 01:28:34,982
It sucks.

1353
01:29:02,176 --> 01:29:03,277
Do you
remember when...

1354
01:29:04,579 --> 01:29:06,547
Mom was away in the States?

1355
01:29:08,783 --> 01:29:09,784
I was 11.

1356
01:29:11,919 --> 01:29:13,386
It was just you and me
for a month.

1357
01:29:15,156 --> 01:29:16,123
Yeah.

1358
01:29:17,457 --> 01:29:18,391
Yeah.

1359
01:29:21,128 --> 01:29:22,563
I never told you this before.

1360
01:29:27,969 --> 01:29:29,570
I heard you crying one night.

1361
01:29:31,973 --> 01:29:34,441
It was late,
and you were sobbing.

1362
01:29:39,013 --> 01:29:40,380
I didn't know what to do.

1363
01:29:40,514 --> 01:29:42,183
I'd never heard you cry before.

1364
01:29:47,088 --> 01:29:49,123
And I wanted to comfort you,

1365
01:29:49,991 --> 01:29:50,925
but I was...

1366
01:29:54,061 --> 01:29:55,029
Scared?

1367
01:30:00,835 --> 01:30:01,769
Yeah.

1368
01:30:07,041 --> 01:30:08,242
<i>I wanna go home.</i>

1369
01:30:11,579 --> 01:30:13,714
<i>I miss my family, Susan,</i>
<i>and I wanna go home.</i>

1370
01:30:14,282 --> 01:30:16,449
<i>Oh, my God!</i>
<i>You're married!</i>

1371
01:30:17,285 --> 01:30:19,053
<i>-No!</i>
<i>-I knew that this was...</i>

1372
01:30:47,949 --> 01:30:48,883
Hmm.

1373
01:30:50,851 --> 01:30:52,920
-Mom?
-Mmm?

1374
01:30:53,054 --> 01:30:54,055
What is it, sweetheart?

1375
01:30:57,558 --> 01:30:59,060
Can we pretend that I'm older?

1376
01:31:00,094 --> 01:31:01,062
Mmm.

1377
01:31:03,698 --> 01:31:05,333
-You're good at pretend.
-Yeah, I know.

1378
01:31:06,767 --> 01:31:08,102
I want you to pretend with me.

1379
01:31:10,738 --> 01:31:12,306
That sounds fun. When?

1380
01:31:13,040 --> 01:31:14,108
Now.

1381
01:31:14,241 --> 01:31:15,810
-Now?
-Yeah, right now.

1382
01:31:16,544 --> 01:31:17,477
Okay.

1383
01:31:21,148 --> 01:31:22,116
Okay.

1384
01:31:26,988 --> 01:31:29,457
Begin pretending to be older.

1385
01:31:33,060 --> 01:31:34,762
I'm bad with men, Mom.

1386
01:31:39,767 --> 01:31:41,068
You're really getting into it.

1387
01:31:41,202 --> 01:31:42,703
Where did you even
hear that phrase, sweetheart?

1388
01:31:42,837 --> 01:31:44,504
Just pretend...
pretend with me, okay?

1389
01:31:47,475 --> 01:31:50,177
I'm bad with men, Mom.

1390
01:31:51,479 --> 01:31:53,247
-Now why would you say that?
-'Cause I am.

1391
01:32:00,788 --> 01:32:01,722
So am I.

1392
01:32:05,326 --> 01:32:06,260
I know.

1393
01:32:12,066 --> 01:32:13,067
Why?

1394
01:32:13,701 --> 01:32:14,602
Why is that?

1395
01:32:16,704 --> 01:32:17,872
Oh, I wish I knew.

1396
01:32:21,308 --> 01:32:22,209
I wish I knew.

1397
01:32:26,515 --> 01:32:27,882
I'm still trying
to figure that out.

1398
01:32:31,852 --> 01:32:33,721
It's okay. It's okay. I know.

1399
01:32:37,925 --> 01:32:41,530
When I'm sad,
or angry,

1400
01:32:42,430 --> 01:32:44,231
it feels like the world
might fall apart.

1401
01:32:53,574 --> 01:32:57,445
That's the world, David.
You know, it's messy,

1402
01:32:58,813 --> 01:33:01,282
it's shitty.
It's full of uncertainty.

1403
01:33:03,150 --> 01:33:06,420
But... they try
to protect you from it.

1404
01:33:08,022 --> 01:33:09,256
They made a promise they would.

1405
01:33:10,691 --> 01:33:12,026
-They?
-Uh, we.

1406
01:33:14,161 --> 01:33:15,029
We made that promise.

1407
01:33:16,565 --> 01:33:17,566
For better and for worse.

1408
01:33:19,033 --> 01:33:19,967
And maybe...

1409
01:33:22,103 --> 01:33:24,105
Maybe it was for worse.
I don't know.

1410
01:33:26,440 --> 01:33:28,309
Your mom and dad love you...

1411
01:33:30,044 --> 01:33:30,978
very much.

1412
01:33:36,518 --> 01:33:37,451
Yeah.

1413
01:33:40,454 --> 01:33:41,956
I have to leave
in the morning.

1414
01:33:42,089 --> 01:33:44,925
Well, I know.
For school.

1415
01:33:45,059 --> 01:33:46,595
We're still pretending.

1416
01:33:46,727 --> 01:33:48,028
Oh, okay.

1417
01:33:49,430 --> 01:33:50,364
Where are you headed?

1418
01:33:51,499 --> 01:33:52,534
To the city.

1419
01:33:52,666 --> 01:33:55,669
Wow. Miss Big Shot.

1420
01:34:01,909 --> 01:34:02,877
I'm gonna miss you.

1421
01:34:04,945 --> 01:34:06,147
I'm gonna miss you so much.

1422
01:34:10,117 --> 01:34:12,119
I'm scared I'm not gonna
be a good adult, Mom.

1423
01:34:15,689 --> 01:34:16,690
You know, sweetheart,

1424
01:34:18,826 --> 01:34:20,060
you are capable

1425
01:34:21,695 --> 01:34:23,497
of being content in this life.

1426
01:34:25,299 --> 01:34:26,467
You just have to choose it.

1427
01:34:28,969 --> 01:34:30,171
What about being happy?

1428
01:34:33,374 --> 01:34:35,743
You can make yourself crazy
trying to be happy.

1429
01:34:37,311 --> 01:34:38,647
Be content first.

1430
01:34:40,114 --> 01:34:41,516
Choose to be content.

1431
01:34:42,850 --> 01:34:44,586
And enjoy
the moments of happiness

1432
01:34:44,718 --> 01:34:45,587
that come from that.

1433
01:34:49,256 --> 01:34:50,191
Okay.

1434
01:35:05,105 --> 01:35:06,407
Can we stop pretending now?

1435
01:35:09,343 --> 01:35:10,311
Why?

1436
01:35:11,979 --> 01:35:13,347
Because I want you
to tuck me in.

1437
01:35:31,232 --> 01:35:33,367
-Snuggy bunny.
-Night.

1438
01:35:36,870 --> 01:35:38,005
Good night, sweetheart.

1439
01:35:40,374 --> 01:35:41,342
Bye, Mom.

1440
01:36:00,595 --> 01:36:04,098
Fuck, yes! Still got it.

1441
01:36:05,199 --> 01:36:06,267
<i>You win!</i>

1442
01:36:06,400 --> 01:36:07,401
When did you get
so good at this game?

1443
01:36:10,104 --> 01:36:13,941
-Wanna play again?
-No, I'm actually... exhausted.

1444
01:36:18,613 --> 01:36:20,914
Oh, there's something
I've been wanting to...

1445
01:36:21,982 --> 01:36:22,850
tell you for a while now.

1446
01:36:23,652 --> 01:36:24,653
What is it?

1447
01:36:25,553 --> 01:36:26,588
You should know that...

1448
01:36:29,724 --> 01:36:30,625
you're special.

1449
01:36:32,226 --> 01:36:33,695
You tell me that all the time.

1450
01:36:34,228 --> 01:36:36,263
Yeah, I know.

1451
01:36:58,653 --> 01:37:01,922
<i>Love is funny</i>

1452
01:37:03,057 --> 01:37:05,527
<i>Or it's sad</i>

1453
01:37:06,327 --> 01:37:09,430
<i>Or it's quiet</i>

1454
01:37:09,564 --> 01:37:13,100
<i>Or it's mad</i>

1455
01:37:13,233 --> 01:37:16,470
<i>It's a good thing</i>

1456
01:37:16,604 --> 01:37:19,541
<i>Or it's bad</i>

1457
01:37:20,775 --> 01:37:25,846
<i>But beautiful</i>

1458
01:37:26,313 --> 01:37:27,381
Did your phone
crap out on you?

1459
01:37:27,515 --> 01:37:28,949
It did indeed.

1460
01:37:29,083 --> 01:37:31,185
Ah! I told you.
You would have been fucked.

1461
01:37:31,318 --> 01:37:33,655
Oh, I was fucked anyway,
many times over.

1462
01:37:33,788 --> 01:37:36,624
But I think it worked out okay.

1463
01:37:37,358 --> 01:37:39,393
Did you meet anyone on the way?

1464
01:37:42,062 --> 01:37:44,164
Is that what you,
um, you do here?

1465
01:37:44,298 --> 01:37:46,967
You rent cars and fuck lives?

1466
01:37:47,101 --> 01:37:48,570
-Hey. Hey, hey.
-"Fuck lives"?

1467
01:37:48,703 --> 01:37:50,538
No... I just...

1468
01:37:52,607 --> 01:37:53,541
Is this some kind of...

1469
01:37:57,211 --> 01:37:58,345
soulmate service?

1470
01:37:59,581 --> 01:38:01,583
-Oh, I like that.
-Me, too.

1471
01:38:02,149 --> 01:38:03,350
Wouldn't that be nice?

1472
01:38:04,084 --> 01:38:05,219
Some service
that would just find

1473
01:38:05,352 --> 01:38:06,387
the exact right person for you?

1474
01:38:07,354 --> 01:38:08,690
Would make life so much easier.

1475
01:38:09,524 --> 01:38:10,525
It would.

1476
01:38:11,726 --> 01:38:13,394
So, you weren't trying
to match me and...

1477
01:38:13,994 --> 01:38:16,564
Stacy Dunn.
No, she never picked up her car.

1478
01:38:16,698 --> 01:38:17,965
What is this still doing here?

1479
01:38:23,504 --> 01:38:25,205
So, Sarah was...

1480
01:38:25,673 --> 01:38:26,775
Oh, she came last minute.

1481
01:38:27,274 --> 01:38:29,176
Fortunately,
Stacy's car was available.

1482
01:38:29,878 --> 01:38:31,211
Sarah made a good understudy.

1483
01:38:31,345 --> 01:38:34,081
I love that!

1484
01:38:34,749 --> 01:38:35,650
Me, too.

1485
01:38:37,418 --> 01:38:39,253
She hasn't been back yet? Sarah?

1486
01:38:39,953 --> 01:38:41,088
No.

1487
01:38:56,704 --> 01:38:57,639
Thank you.

1488
01:38:59,239 --> 01:39:00,240
Anytime.

1489
01:39:33,641 --> 01:39:35,944
<i>You have arrived</i>
<i>at your final destination.</i>

1490
01:39:36,611 --> 01:39:37,579
<i>Please return your car.</i>

1491
01:39:43,918 --> 01:39:45,687
Is this my destination?

1492
01:39:49,289 --> 01:39:50,357
<i>It depends, Sarah.</i>

1493
01:39:51,492 --> 01:39:52,861
<i>How do you want this to end?</i>

1494
01:40:47,882 --> 01:40:48,783
How'd you find me?

1495
01:40:50,718 --> 01:40:51,686
GPS.

1496
01:40:52,921 --> 01:40:53,955
Ah.

1497
01:40:57,391 --> 01:40:59,393
I wanna say something now and...

1498
01:41:00,460 --> 01:41:01,996
it's something I've been
thinking, and I just...

1499
01:41:03,196 --> 01:41:04,699
want to hear my mouth say it.

1500
01:41:08,235 --> 01:41:09,202
Um...

1501
01:41:11,471 --> 01:41:12,707
You are worth the risk.

1502
01:41:15,409 --> 01:41:17,344
I know you might hurt me and...

1503
01:41:18,345 --> 01:41:20,748
I mean, I would be devastated
if you left me

1504
01:41:20,882 --> 01:41:24,184
and I would be devastated
if I left you first.

1505
01:41:24,886 --> 01:41:26,453
And I know
both things are a possibility.

1506
01:41:26,588 --> 01:41:29,222
And that scares me deeply.

1507
01:41:33,393 --> 01:41:34,729
You might think
you know how deep,

1508
01:41:34,862 --> 01:41:35,797
but you don't.

1509
01:41:37,865 --> 01:41:40,400
But if anyone ever were to know,
I would want it to be you.

1510
01:41:46,273 --> 01:41:47,240
I think...

1511
01:41:50,845 --> 01:41:52,279
I think we could
be content together.

1512
01:41:54,181 --> 01:41:56,216
And in love.

1513
01:41:59,554 --> 01:42:00,722
Because I am in love with you.

1514
01:42:02,757 --> 01:42:05,660
<i>When people keep repeatin'</i>

1515
01:42:06,761 --> 01:42:09,429
<i>That you'll never fall in love</i>

1516
01:42:10,965 --> 01:42:14,201
<i>When everybody keeps retreatin'</i>

1517
01:42:15,335 --> 01:42:18,138
<i>But you can't seem</i>
<i>to get enough</i>

1518
01:42:19,574 --> 01:42:22,543
<i>Let my love open the door</i>

1519
01:42:23,945 --> 01:42:27,381
<i>Let my love open the door</i>

1520
01:42:28,348 --> 01:42:31,986
<i>Let my love open the door</i>

1521
01:42:32,120 --> 01:42:35,355
<i>To your heart</i>

1522
01:42:35,489 --> 01:42:36,724
You got one more door in you?

1523
01:42:36,858 --> 01:42:38,793
<i>To your heart</i>

1524
01:42:41,095 --> 01:42:42,897
-I could do one more door.
-Come on.

1525
01:42:47,467 --> 01:42:50,571
<i>Let my love open the door</i>

1526
01:42:51,773 --> 01:42:55,510
<i>Let my love open the door</i>

1527
01:42:56,209 --> 01:42:59,881
<i>Let my love open the door</i>

1528
01:43:00,014 --> 01:43:03,250
<i>To your heart</i>

1529
01:43:05,520 --> 01:43:09,222
<i>I got the only key</i>
<i>to your heart</i>

1530
01:43:10,290 --> 01:43:13,828
<i>That can stop you fallin' apart</i>

1531
01:43:13,961 --> 01:43:17,765
<i>Try today, you'll find this way</i>

1532
01:43:18,498 --> 01:43:21,803
<i>Come on</i>
<i>And give me a chance to say</i>

1533
01:43:22,436 --> 01:43:25,807
<i>Let my love open the door</i>

1534
01:43:27,008 --> 01:43:31,012
<i>It's all I'm livin' for</i>

1535
01:43:31,145 --> 01:43:34,314
<i>Release yourself from misery</i>

1536
01:43:35,717 --> 01:43:39,053
<i>There's only one thing</i>
<i>Gonna set you free</i>

1537
01:43:39,187 --> 01:43:41,856
<i>And that's my love</i>

1538
01:43:43,825 --> 01:43:46,894
<i>That's my love</i>

1539
01:43:48,162 --> 01:43:50,263
<i>That's my love</i>

1540
01:43:52,399 --> 01:43:54,936
<i>My love</i>

1541
01:44:10,952 --> 01:44:15,890
<i>All the lives I've lived</i>

1542
01:44:19,761 --> 01:44:25,633
<i>I'm ready to forgive myself</i>

1543
01:44:29,704 --> 01:44:35,408
<i>Deep lake diving in</i>

1544
01:44:38,579 --> 01:44:43,518
<i>My love could re-begin</i>

1545
01:44:45,452 --> 01:44:50,591
<i>Again</i>

1546
01:44:55,730 --> 01:44:59,801
<i>Part of me is missing</i>

1547
01:44:59,934 --> 01:45:03,538
<i>I doubt you see</i>

1548
01:45:03,671 --> 01:45:05,840
<i>How helpless I feel</i>

1549
01:45:06,339 --> 01:45:10,745
<i>Fragile, my heart</i>
<i>I long to be held</i>

1550
01:45:10,878 --> 01:45:13,147
<i>I long to be loved</i>

1551
01:45:13,281 --> 01:45:16,951
<i>Might be a myth</i>

1552
01:45:17,084 --> 01:45:20,822
<i>But I'll take the risk</i>

1553
01:45:30,932 --> 01:45:35,502
<i>Such a lonely road</i>

1554
01:45:40,440 --> 01:45:46,180
<i>Found a kindred soul</i>

1555
01:45:49,016 --> 01:45:54,121
<i>Like I knew you from somewhere</i>

1556
01:45:58,759 --> 01:46:02,964
<i>Like magic in the air</i>

1557
01:46:07,835 --> 01:46:13,174

<i>Rewrite my elegy</i>
<i>Childhood memories</i>

1566
01:46:45,373 --> 01:46:49,476
