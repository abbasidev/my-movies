[Ed, on tape recorder]
<i>My name is Ed Warren,</i>

2
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:23,607
<i>here with my wife, Lorraine,
and Victoria Grainger.</i>

3
00:00:24,483 --> 00:00:26,777
<i>It's April 20th, 1964.</i>

4
00:00:28,112 --> 00:00:33,325
<i>Victoria… when did you first notice
these supernatural occurrences?</i>

5
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:38,080
[Victoria] <i>I'm sorry, I
don't know how to do this.</i>

6
00:00:38,539 --> 00:00:40,666
[Ed] <i>Why don't you just take
us back to the beginning?</i>

7
00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:42,752
[rain pattering]

8
00:00:44,044 --> 00:00:46,422
[Victoria] <i>My father thought
something was following him.</i>

9
00:00:48,257 --> 00:00:49,884
<i>Something he couldn't see.</i>

10
00:00:51,802 --> 00:00:54,096
He'd lock the doors at night,
and the next morning, they…

11
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:55,306
[pattering fades]

12
00:00:55,389 --> 00:00:56,682
…they'd be open.

13
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:02,396
[shuddering breath]

14
00:01:02,772 --> 00:01:05,274
Then he started
hearing… [inhales]

15
00:01:06,317 --> 00:01:07,318
…voices.

16
00:01:08,402 --> 00:01:09,695
I didn't believe him.

17
00:01:11,530 --> 00:01:13,199
I thought he was
getting old, you know?

18
00:01:17,328 --> 00:01:18,871
But then I came in one day, and…

19
00:01:20,247 --> 00:01:22,750
[shuddering breaths]

20
00:01:23,083 --> 00:01:24,210
I found him.

[rope creaking]

22
00:01:27,755 --> 00:01:29,673

[Victoria sobbing]

24
00:01:32,218 --> 00:01:34,261
It was so quiet here
after he was gone.

25
00:01:37,556 --> 00:01:40,059
But then something
changed. [deep breath]

26
00:01:41,811 --> 00:01:43,103
I could feel it.

27
00:01:44,980 --> 00:01:46,941
<i>This really strong
feeling, like…</i>

28
00:01:47,024 --> 00:01:48,901
[panting]

29
00:01:48,984 --> 00:01:50,569
<i>…like I'm being watched.</i>

30
00:01:51,904 --> 00:01:53,906
[faint growl]

31
00:02:03,332 --> 00:02:04,792
There's something in there.

32
00:02:06,877 --> 00:02:08,254
And when I'm here alone…

33
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:11,382
And it's very quiet…

34
00:02:13,467 --> 00:02:15,010
…it calls to me.

35
00:02:28,107 --> 00:02:29,149

Hon…

41
00:02:52,548 --> 00:02:55,175
I don't know. I don't have
a good feeling about this.

42
00:02:55,259 --> 00:02:58,178
Ed, I can do this.

Annabelle Mullins.

I don't know. Uh,
you know, me, us.

nothing to worry about.

She nearly bit off
my entire cheek.

only been dating for six months,

know, you know.

imagine my life without her.

So…

would love to have your blessing.

…that our family is not

And, um, you know, you're right,
it has been a very short time.

948
00:48:19,355 --> 00:48:22,525

other when we got engaged.

have our blessing.

known each other six months.

that you guys...

965
00:49:01,731 --> 00:49:03,358

-Yeah, there we go.
-No.

01:03:48,534 --> 01:03:49,952
What happened?

1221
01:03:50,035 --> 01:03:54,289
[crying echoes]

1222
01:03:55,249 --> 01:03:56,458
It's okay.

1223
01:03:56,542 --> 01:03:59,962
-[overlapping chatter]
-[man] Mr. Smurl. Mr. Smurl.

1224
01:04:00,045 --> 01:04:00,963
-[EMT] Careful.
-Jack.

1225
01:04:01,046 --> 01:04:02,005
Can you back off, please?

1226
01:04:02,089 --> 01:04:02,881
What's going on in your house?

1227
01:04:02,965 --> 01:04:04,467
-Please, can you make some room?
-Back off!

1228
01:04:04,550 --> 01:04:05,634
Please, have some respect!

1229
01:04:05,717 --> 01:04:07,470
-Out of respect for my mother.
-Please, back off!

1230
01:04:07,553 --> 01:04:09,930
-[Jack] Give us space, please!
-[girl] Is she okay?

1231
01:04:10,013 --> 01:04:11,182
[Jack] For heaven's
sake, outta my face!

1232
01:04:11,265 --> 01:04:12,224
[man] Careful.

1233
01:04:12,307 --> 01:04:13,851
-[John] Go away!
-[Jack] You'll be okay, Mom.

1234
01:04:13,934 --> 01:04:15,936
Kids, Grandma's gonna
be fine, don't worry.

1235
01:04:16,353 --> 01:04:17,563
Dawn, look after your mother.

1236
01:04:17,646 --> 01:04:18,647
-Can you get out of my...
-[chattering]

1237
01:04:18,730 --> 01:04:20,441
-Jack, I'll see you there, okay?
-See you at the hospital.

1238
01:04:20,524 --> 01:04:21,775
I'm gonna go with Ma.

1239
01:04:21,858 --> 01:04:23,578
-We'll be in touch, sweetie.
-[John] Yeah.

1240
01:04:24,611 --> 01:04:25,613
[Janet, quietly]
Why won't it stop?

1241
01:04:25,696 --> 01:04:26,696
Mom, look.

1242
01:04:26,989 --> 01:04:30,534

[dog groans]

1246
01:04:41,253 --> 01:04:42,296
[priest] Yes.

1247
01:04:43,463 --> 01:04:46,091
-That's Simon.
-Oh, hey, Simon.

1248
01:04:46,842 --> 01:04:48,427
I grew up with a dog like this.

1249
01:04:48,510 --> 01:04:50,721
-Oh, you did?
-Yeah. [chuckles]

1250
01:04:51,763 --> 01:04:54,349
Th... That ambulance out there…

1251
01:04:55,517 --> 01:04:56,560
…who was that?

1252
01:05:00,564 --> 01:05:01,857
It's my mother-in-law.

1253
01:05:03,233 --> 01:05:05,110
[inhales] Some…

1254
01:05:07,154 --> 01:05:09,615
Something pushed
her down the stairs.

1255
01:05:09,990 --> 01:05:12,284
-It's getting worse.
-[sighs]

1256
01:05:12,367 --> 01:05:13,869
And we can't afford to leave.

1257
01:05:17,581 --> 01:05:20,375
-I'm so glad that you're here.
-[sighs]

1258
01:05:20,751 --> 01:05:22,836
[sighs] We really thought that

1259
01:05:22,919 --> 01:05:24,755
the church had
forgotten about us.

1260
01:05:25,672 --> 01:05:27,799
[priest] Mrs. Smurl, uh…

1261
01:05:29,968 --> 01:05:32,012
The church doesn't
know I'm here.

1262
01:05:32,095 --> 01:05:34,014
I'm actually from Connecticut.

1263
01:05:34,097 --> 01:05:37,142
But I have worked with
cases similar to yours,

1264
01:05:37,225 --> 01:05:41,855
and I have been following your
story very closely on the news.

1265
01:05:42,898 --> 01:05:44,775
I thought I might
be able to help.

1266
01:05:48,153 --> 01:05:51,490
In the name of the Father,
the Son, and the Holy Spirit.

1280
01:07:17,325 --> 01:07:18,285
What happened down there?

1281
01:07:18,368 --> 01:07:19,411
Something's here.

1282
01:07:19,828 --> 01:07:21,308
-[briefcase clicks]
-You're leaving?

1283
01:07:21,621 --> 01:07:25,459
We are gonna help you. [panting]

1284
01:07:25,876 --> 01:07:27,294
The church will listen to me.

1285
01:07:28,044 --> 01:07:30,964
I promise you, they'll listen.

1293
01:08:13,673 --> 01:08:14,674
Can I help you?

1294
01:08:14,758 --> 01:08:16,134
Bishop McKenna, please.

1295
01:08:16,718 --> 01:08:18,512
Of course. And you are?

1296
01:08:18,595 --> 01:08:19,846
Father Gordon.

1297
01:08:19,930 --> 01:08:20,931
One minute.

1298
01:08:22,307 --> 01:08:24,643
[phone rings in office]

1299
01:08:24,726 --> 01:08:26,812
I have a Father Gordon.

1300
01:08:28,188 --> 01:08:30,398
-This is regarding?
-The Smurls.

1301
01:08:30,482 --> 01:08:32,692
They're a family
from West Pittston.

1302
01:08:32,776 --> 01:08:33,985
It's urgent.

1303
01:08:35,278 --> 01:08:38,490
He's here about a family
from West Pittston.

1304
01:08:38,573 --> 01:08:39,699
He says it's urgent.

1305
01:08:41,743 --> 01:08:43,078
All right.

1306
01:08:45,038 --> 01:08:46,790
He'll just be one moment.

1307
01:08:58,844 --> 01:09:00,262

Are you all right?

Yes, I'm… [chuckles]

1311
01:09:13,733 --> 01:09:14,901

maker of heaven and Earth, of
all that is seen and unseen.

1332
01:11:11,309 --> 01:11:13,520
God protect me!

[Tony] There she is!

1339
01:11:42,215 --> 01:11:45,051
See, you've always gotta
check if she's got a spark.

1340
01:11:45,135 --> 01:11:46,720
-[engine slows]
-Ah.

1341
01:11:48,513 --> 01:11:51,808
Kept thinking it was the carburetor.
Should have checked the spark plug.

1342
01:11:51,891 --> 01:11:53,268
[scoffs]

1343
01:11:53,977 --> 01:11:55,186
Nice work.

1344
01:11:55,270 --> 01:11:56,563
[Tony] Well, you know, I, uh,

1345
01:11:56,646 --> 01:11:59,482
I couldn't afford a mechanic in
college, so I had to teach myself.

1346
01:12:02,485 --> 01:12:05,030
Hey, how much has Judy
told you about what we do?

1347
01:12:06,614 --> 01:12:08,783
Enough to not ask
many questions.

1348
01:12:11,911 --> 01:12:14,330
Come inside. I wanna
show you something.

1349
01:12:17,917 --> 01:12:19,419
Don't touch anything.

1350
01:12:21,212 --> 01:12:25,175
Everything you see in here
is either haunted, cursed,

1351
01:12:25,258 --> 01:12:28,219
or been used in some sort
of ritualistic practice.

1352
01:12:30,305 --> 01:12:31,681
Nothing's a toy.

1353
01:12:32,974 --> 01:12:34,309
Not even the toys.

1354
01:12:34,392 --> 01:12:37,062
-[Tony scoffs]
-[Ed chuckles]

1355
01:12:39,022 --> 01:12:41,024
[Tony] If all these
things are so evil,

1356
01:12:41,900 --> 01:12:43,651
why do you keep them around?

1357
01:12:43,735 --> 01:12:45,445
Why not just destroy them?

1358
01:12:45,528 --> 01:12:48,990
It's complicated. Sometimes
that makes things worse.

1359
01:12:49,532 --> 01:12:52,827
Sometimes… they
just won't let you.

1360
01:12:54,037 --> 01:12:56,539
We've found it safer to keep
the genie in the bottle.

1361
01:12:57,665 --> 01:12:59,417
It's better in here
than out there.

1362
01:13:00,418 --> 01:13:01,795
How many cases you guys had?

1363
01:13:01,878 --> 01:13:03,546
[Ed] Cases? Oh. [sighs]

1364
01:13:04,547 --> 01:13:05,715
Maybe a thousand?

1365
01:13:06,299 --> 01:13:07,300
A thousand?

1366
01:13:07,383 --> 01:13:11,262
Yeah, well. We started
young, about your age.

1367
01:13:13,723 --> 01:13:16,309
Mmm. It's funny. This room,

1368
01:13:17,727 --> 01:13:19,562
every little thing in it…

1369
01:13:21,147 --> 01:13:22,649
…is our story.

1370
01:13:25,568 --> 01:13:27,237
It's our life's work.

1371
01:13:29,405 --> 01:13:31,908
Listen, the other day?

1372
01:13:32,951 --> 01:13:34,035
I get it.

1373
01:13:34,119 --> 01:13:38,998
Yeah I... I was just… nervous,
and you're kinda intimidating.

1374
01:13:39,082 --> 01:13:40,708
[Ed] We almost lost Judy.

1375
01:13:43,211 --> 01:13:44,671
She was stillborn.

1376
01:13:48,383 --> 01:13:49,843
For probably a minute.

1377
01:13:53,263 --> 01:13:55,765
It was the longest
minute of our lives.

1378
01:13:57,934 --> 01:14:01,479
And as a parent, that's
something you never forget.

1379
01:14:05,066 --> 01:14:06,901
So, while I know
she's your fiancée,

1380
01:14:09,571 --> 01:14:10,697
for us,

1381
01:14:11,406 --> 01:14:15,952
she will always be that little
baby, fighting for her life.

1382
01:14:18,705 --> 01:14:20,123
I understand, sir.

1383
01:14:23,168 --> 01:14:24,377
Do you?

1384
01:14:25,795 --> 01:14:29,048
[tapping]

1385
01:14:30,008 --> 01:14:32,260
-[panting]
-[Ed] What's wrong?

1386
01:14:33,261 --> 01:14:35,180
-[Lorraine sighs]
-What?

1387
01:14:36,014 --> 01:14:39,976
Father Gordon, he
was a good man.

1388
01:14:41,728 --> 01:14:43,146
A man of God.

1389
01:14:44,564 --> 01:14:46,733
And he helped so many people.

1390
01:14:47,483 --> 01:14:50,612
I didn't know Father
to be a man of despair.

1391
01:14:51,404 --> 01:14:54,699
No, Father Gordon was light.

1392
01:14:57,035 --> 01:15:00,288
And he brought that light
to me and my family,

1393
01:15:00,371 --> 01:15:02,832

shotgun right in my face.

1567
01:27:24,949 --> 01:27:27,326
And I hear… click.

1568
01:27:28,494 --> 01:27:29,828
I, uh…

1569
01:27:30,329 --> 01:27:33,916
I unfreeze, and, uh,
we take the guy down.

1570
01:27:34,375 --> 01:27:35,584
Arrest him.

1571
01:27:37,628 --> 01:27:40,255
Later, my partner
comes up to me,

1572
01:27:40,339 --> 01:27:43,258
and he says,
"You're a dead man."

1573
01:27:45,010 --> 01:27:46,345
He shows me the shotgun.

1574
01:27:48,222 --> 01:27:49,222
It was loaded.

1575
01:27:50,516 --> 01:27:52,393
-Primer was struck on the shell.
-[exhales]

1576
01:27:52,476 --> 01:27:53,644
Misfire.

1577
01:27:55,813 --> 01:27:59,566
I figure, there's a
world where I'm dead.

1578
01:28:01,110 --> 01:28:03,612
Where I never grow old.

1579
01:28:04,530 --> 01:28:06,323
I never have kids.

1580
01:28:06,949 --> 01:28:08,993
I never get to
marry your daughter.

1581
01:28:14,665 --> 01:28:17,626
So next day, I-I quit,

1582
01:28:18,210 --> 01:28:20,796
and I go out and buy
that ring for Judy.

1583

-You put it on my head!</i>

1586
01:28:37,688 --> 01:28:39,523

-"Thank you?"</i>

1587

supposed to be off.

[flashbulb whines]

1595
01:29:09,845 --> 01:29:11,472
I just thought I could…

1596
01:29:13,307 --> 01:29:14,725
…document it all.

1597
01:29:19,146 --> 01:29:20,230
Everything okay?

1598
01:29:21,899 --> 01:29:22,983
Yeah.

Uh, what's her name?

1616
01:30:58,871 --> 01:30:59,997
This is Susie.

Hey, Susie.

1618
01:31:03,333 --> 01:31:04,918
Do you like dolls?

[voices crescendo, fade]

1635
01:33:05,122 --> 01:33:07,499
The spirits, there
are three of them.

1636
01:33:08,625 --> 01:33:11,920
They never lived in this
house, but on this land.

1637
01:33:13,880 --> 01:33:15,424
This was farmland.

1638
01:33:18,969 --> 01:33:20,178
Uh…

1639
01:33:22,222 --> 01:33:23,890
There was a woman.

1640
01:33:24,766 --> 01:33:27,019
She was wild. She…

1641
01:33:28,312 --> 01:33:30,022
Just so tormented.

1642
01:33:30,814 --> 01:33:33,400
She had an affair, and…

1643
01:33:34,651 --> 01:33:37,195
…her husband went insane.

1644
01:33:38,238 --> 01:33:41,283
He took an axe, and
he went after her.

1645
01:33:41,366 --> 01:33:45,078
She hid in the basement,
but she wasn't alone.

1646
01:33:45,162 --> 01:33:47,539
She went with her
elderly mother.

1647
01:33:49,958 --> 01:33:52,753
-And he killed them both.
-Look, we've seen

1648
01:33:52,836 --> 01:33:55,005
violent manifestations
like that before.

1649
01:33:55,088 --> 01:33:56,673
So why is this different?

1650
01:33:56,757 --> 01:33:58,967
The three spirits are a façade.

1651
01:33:59,259 --> 01:34:01,928
Something else is
blocking my vision.

1652
01:34:02,846 --> 01:34:04,348
Hiding behind them.

1653
01:34:05,265 --> 01:34:06,391
Demonic?

1654
01:34:08,101 --> 01:34:11,772
It's controlling the spirits. It's
using them against the Smurls.

1655
01:34:11,855 --> 01:34:15,817
But what's it want? I mean, this
has been going on for months.

1656
01:34:16,777 --> 01:34:18,236
What's it waiting for?

1657
01:34:24,659 --> 01:34:25,659

you come up here, please?

There's something in the attic.

1700
01:39:39,474 --> 01:39:40,892
It can't be.

1701
01:39:41,726 --> 01:39:45,939
[exhales] It… found us.

No, Lorraine. No, don't.

a week, Judy recovered.</i>

01:40:33,778 --> 01:40:36,197
The doctors said they'd
never seen anything like it.

1708
01:40:37,323 --> 01:40:39,075
[sighs] She was a miracle.

1709
01:40:40,452 --> 01:40:43,830
But as for that mirror,
we never saw it again…

1710
01:40:45,832 --> 01:40:47,125
…until today.

1711
01:40:48,251 --> 01:40:51,588

it's never that simple.</i>

<i>It wasn't done with you,
and it wasn't done with us.</i>

1714
01:41:02,974 --> 01:41:04,809
Okay, so then what
happened to the woman

1715
01:41:05,894 --> 01:41:07,729
from the antique store?

1716
01:41:11,316 --> 01:41:12,316
We don't know.

1717
01:41:12,650 --> 01:41:13,860
Uh…

1718
01:41:15,069 --> 01:41:16,279
We never went back.

1719
01:41:17,280 --> 01:41:20,366
That thing in your
attic is a demon.

1720
01:41:20,700 --> 01:41:22,911
It's the first one that
we ever encountered.

1721
01:41:24,120 --> 01:41:28,666
We were young, and we were scared,
and we almost lost our daughter.

1722
01:41:30,001 --> 01:41:33,004
So, we told ourselves that
the risk was just too great,

1723
01:41:33,087 --> 01:41:35,215
so we couldn't
chance going back.

1724
01:41:36,674 --> 01:41:38,092
So, yes.

1725
01:41:40,053 --> 01:41:41,262
We ran away.

1726
01:41:44,974 --> 01:41:45,974
[Jack] I'll…

1727
01:41:46,976 --> 01:41:49,646
…take it as a good
sign you're still here.

1728
01:41:49,729 --> 01:41:51,064
Mm.

1729
01:41:51,147 --> 01:41:52,315
We're not leaving you.

1730
01:41:54,609 --> 01:41:55,485

1733
01:42:01,157 --> 01:42:02,157
[Tony] Some water?

1734
01:42:02,492 --> 01:42:03,618
Sorry. [sniffles]

1735
01:42:04,494 --> 01:42:05,494
[Heather] So, what now?

1736
01:42:06,704 --> 01:42:07,997
How do you get rid of it?

1737
01:42:09,666 --> 01:42:12,794
Ed! You're really gonna
take that thing home?

1738
01:42:12,877 --> 01:42:14,379
We can't leave it here.

1739
01:42:14,462 --> 01:42:16,923
Artifact room is the only
place that can contain it.

1740
01:42:20,802 --> 01:42:24,889
All right, West Pittston,
back home to Monroe. Take 80.

1741
01:42:24,973 --> 01:42:27,308
Lorraine and Judy can stay
behind. Wait, 84 is faster.

1742
01:42:27,392 --> 01:42:29,227
