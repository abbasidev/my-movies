Well past three K limit.

180
00:12:07,686 --> 00:12:09,563
I want you to stick around,
watch him do his checks.

181
00:12:09,646 --> 00:12:12,233
It's gonna take a couple hours,
but it's stuff you gotta know.

-All right?
-Copy that, boss.

Okay. Just need
to fuel up first.

259
00:17:55,409 --> 00:17:57,744
You're meant to do that
before pickup, 963.

<i>It's not there.</i>

267
00:18:15,304 --> 00:18:17,640
[Kevin] How about under the
kitchen sink? Try there, Ma.

268
00:18:17,723 --> 00:18:19,350
I've gotta pull in to fuel up.

There's no way we're getting up there.

We think it's about two to three hundred
acres, so it's sitting about like that.

A really strong east wind
pushed it down canyon.

got too narrow, too steep.

up over the ridge,

access down from the top.

00:21:35,045 --> 00:21:37,131
-<i>...101.</i>
-Shaun, get on the phone, will ya?

338
00:21:37,214 --> 00:21:41,009
<i>So, he-he's got a temperature.
He doesn't want to talk, Kevin.</i>

339
00:21:41,635 --> 00:21:43,471
<i>He-he says he'll
speak to you later.</i>

340
00:21:43,554 --> 00:21:46,891
-<i>He probably just needs his mom.</i>
-I'm sure he does need his mom, huh?

341
00:21:46,974 --> 00:21:50,394
-He's sick, but he's here with his dad.
-[fire truck horn blares]

342
00:21:51,228 --> 00:21:52,980
He's got me, and he's got you.

343
00:21:54,064 --> 00:21:57,734
Listen, Ma, I can't talk right now.
I gotta get the bus to the depot.

344
00:21:58,277 --> 00:22:00,780
I'll swing by the drugstore,
get Shaun some medicine.

345
00:22:00,863 --> 00:22:03,031
I'll be home as soon as
I can after work, okay?

346
00:22:06,827 --> 00:22:07,828
[dispatcher] <i>Camp IC, Oroville.</i>

347
00:22:07,911 --> 00:22:10,998
<i>We're getting unconfirmed reports
of another fire in that area.</i>

348
00:22:11,498 --> 00:22:13,334
Oroville, Camp IC. Go
ahead. What's its location?

349
00:22:13,417 --> 00:22:14,960
Camp IC, Oroville. We're unsure.

350
00:22:15,043 --> 00:22:17,630
There's a lot of smoke in the area,
and we have a couple cameras down,

351
00:22:17,713 --> 00:22:20,591
but I believe it to be off
Rim Road, north of Concow.

352
00:22:20,674 --> 00:22:22,718
Uh, Oroville, Camp IC copies.

353
00:22:23,427 --> 00:22:25,763
What do you think? That's
a second start or a spot?

354
00:22:25,846 --> 00:22:27,098
[firefighter 1] We're
three miles away.

355
00:22:27,181 --> 00:22:29,141
I don't know how the heck
that would be a spot fire.

356
00:22:29,224 --> 00:22:31,102
That's a long ways from
the-the original fire.

357
00:22:31,185 --> 00:22:32,186
[firefighter 2] Okay.

358
00:22:32,269 --> 00:22:34,647
-I think we've got two fires.
-<i>Camp IC, we received a call</i>

359
00:22:34,730 --> 00:22:36,565
<i>from PG&E. They advised
of a power outage</i>

360
00:22:36,648 --> 00:22:39,026
<i>approximately ten minutes ago
in the Rim Road area of Concow.</i>

361
00:22:39,109 --> 00:22:40,402
-<i>I believe this...</i>
-So it was a power line then.

362
00:22:40,485 --> 00:22:43,823
<i>...is gonna be related to your second start.
There are power lines down in that area.</i>

363
00:22:43,906 --> 00:22:46,575
The PG&E linemen are here.
Do you want them to wait?

364
00:22:47,367 --> 00:22:49,036
-No. I wanna talk to them.
-Okay.

365
00:22:50,537 --> 00:22:53,373
The hell are you guys
doing? I got two fires now.

366
00:22:54,041 --> 00:22:56,210
I need all your lines
in the area shut down,

367
00:22:56,752 --> 00:22:59,004
right away, before I
get any more fires.

368
00:22:59,087 --> 00:23:01,924
We had Red Flag Warnings last
night. You guys knew about this.

369
00:23:02,007 --> 00:23:03,676
Why didn't you
shut it down then?

370
00:23:03,759 --> 00:23:07,054
Look, we'll get our people down
to the substation to shut it down.

371
00:23:07,137 --> 00:23:10,474
We'll get up to the transmission
tower to secure the downed lines.

372
00:23:10,557 --> 00:23:12,017
I got two fires now.

373
00:23:12,935 --> 00:23:16,939
It's on your headquarters. It wasn't your
fault, but let's get this taken care of.

374
00:23:17,022 --> 00:23:18,690
Messina. Messina.

375
00:23:19,525 --> 00:23:21,569
Send five additional strike
teams to this new start.

376
00:23:21,652 --> 00:23:23,154
[lieutenant] Chief, are you
copying this priority traffic?

377
00:23:23,237 --> 00:23:26,532
[person on radio] <i>Camp IC,
Utility 2136. Priority traffic.</i>

378
00:23:27,115 --> 00:23:29,493
Utility 2136, Camp IC. Go ahead.

379
00:23:29,576 --> 00:23:32,121
This is Engineer
Hopkins on Utility 2136.

380
00:23:32,204 --> 00:23:34,039
I'm going off duty
out in Concow.

381
00:23:34,581 --> 00:23:37,125
We've got a serious situation
developing, be advised.

382
00:23:37,751 --> 00:23:39,837
Heavy smoke and embers
blowing in out here.

383
00:23:40,379 --> 00:23:42,298
-Are you sure about that? In Concow?
-Concow?

384
00:23:42,381 --> 00:23:44,967
[Hopkins] <i>That's affirmative.
I'm driving through it now.</i>

385
00:23:45,509 --> 00:23:47,470
<i>Uh, we've got embers
falling around structures.</i>

386
00:23:47,553 --> 00:23:48,846
It's jumped the fucking box.

387
00:23:48,929 --> 00:23:50,890
[siren wailing]

388
00:23:50,973 --> 00:23:53,058
Correction. We've
got a spot fire.

389
00:23:55,727 --> 00:23:58,146
[people screaming]

390
00:23:59,439 --> 00:24:01,233
Correction. Multiple spots.

391
00:24:01,316 --> 00:24:03,527
I count one, two,
three, big ones.

392
00:24:03,610 --> 00:24:05,070
Rapid rate of spread.

393
00:24:05,821 --> 00:24:07,490
I'm losing visibility fast.

394
00:24:07,573 --> 00:24:09,909
That's a hell of a
distance for a spread.

395
00:24:09,992 --> 00:24:11,243
Gotta be at least five miles.

396
00:24:11,326 --> 00:24:13,078
You think it's another
set of power lines?

397
00:24:13,161 --> 00:24:15,831
No, no, no. I guarantee the
power's already off up in Concow.

398
00:24:15,914 --> 00:24:18,250
[firefighter] I mean, that's
a lot of distance covered.

399
00:24:26,091 --> 00:24:27,092
Messina.

400
00:24:28,051 --> 00:24:30,053
Listen to me. It's one fire.

401
00:24:30,804 --> 00:24:32,348
-[firefighter] No. No, that...
-It's one fire.

402
00:24:32,431 --> 00:24:34,517
No, that would be impossible
for it to move that way.

403
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:37,352
-All one damn fire.
-[firefighter 2] If we got one fire,

404
00:24:38,061 --> 00:24:39,939
you're looking at a
perimeter about... like that.

405
00:24:40,022 --> 00:24:41,940
Okay. Let's send
resources to Concow.

406
00:24:42,441 --> 00:24:44,485
Air tankers, engines.
Give him what he needs.

407
00:24:44,568 --> 00:24:46,654
-[firefighter 2] Tankers. Yeah.
-Copy. You got that?

408
00:24:46,737 --> 00:24:48,531
Okay. So, if we've
got fire in Concow,

409
00:24:48,614 --> 00:24:51,242
we have to change that
evac warning to an order.

410
00:24:51,325 --> 00:24:52,409
-Do it.
-Copy.

411
00:24:52,951 --> 00:24:54,828
New containment line
is Jordan Hill Road.

412
00:24:56,246 --> 00:24:58,290
[Ruby] All drivers,
this is Base. Listen up.

413
00:24:58,373 --> 00:25:00,334
Uh, well, I guess today's
a real special day

414
00:25:00,417 --> 00:25:04,129
{\an8}because we just saw that Cal
Fire's got a fire up by Concow.

415
00:25:04,713 --> 00:25:05,965
So, uh, y'all know the drill.

416
00:25:06,048 --> 00:25:09,051
Just stay off the radio, and be
listening for code reds, okay?

417
00:25:10,385 --> 00:25:12,847
[Ruby] <i>963, Base
call. You on your way?</i>

418
00:25:12,930 --> 00:25:16,350
Uh, Base, this is 963.
Uh, ETA 15 minutes, boss.

419
00:25:16,433 --> 00:25:18,602
I've got one more quick
stop I gotta make.

420
00:25:18,685 --> 00:25:21,105
[Ruby] <i>Kevin, you need to
get bus 963 into the garage,</i>

421
00:25:21,188 --> 00:25:22,731
<i>or you're gonna miss
your afternoon route.</i>

422
00:25:22,814 --> 00:25:24,942
<i>I told you, it's gonna
take at least two hours.</i>

423
00:25:26,318 --> 00:25:29,071
Understood, boss. Uh, I've got a
bit of a family situation, okay?

424
00:25:29,655 --> 00:25:31,323
[Ruby] <i>Kevin, I'm
not interested, okay?</i>

425
00:25:31,406 --> 00:25:34,826
<i>I need you to get the bus back here now.
The mechanic can't wait around all day.</i>

426
00:25:35,702 --> 00:25:38,330
Copy that, boss. I'll be
there as soon as I can. Over.

427
00:25:38,914 --> 00:25:41,917
[fire truck horn blares]

428
00:25:46,505 --> 00:25:48,173
[siren wailing]

429
00:25:49,341 --> 00:25:51,426
-Everyone, evacuate! Let's go!
-[person] Help!

00:25:52,344 --> 00:25:54,429
-Go get in that truck, okay?
-[person 2 crying]

431
00:25:55,013 --> 00:25:56,265
Everyone, evacuate!

432
00:25:56,765 --> 00:25:57,766
Let's go!

433
00:25:58,267 --> 00:26:00,686
Leave everything. Leave
that. Leave everything.

434
00:26:00,769 --> 00:26:01,937
Get in the car now!

435
00:26:02,020 --> 00:26:04,060
-Hey, is there anyone else inside?
-[person 3] No.

436
00:26:04,606 --> 00:26:05,858
[Hopkins] Anyone inside?

437
00:26:05,941 --> 00:26:07,359
[person 4] Come
on, baby. Let's go.

438
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:09,945
[Hopkins] Fire department!

439
00:26:12,614 --> 00:26:14,450
[grunts] Guys, let's go.

440
00:26:14,533 --> 00:26:15,659
Leave your bags.

441
00:26:16,451 --> 00:26:17,452
Leave your bags!

442
00:26:17,995 --> 00:26:20,330
-[people clamoring, screaming]
-Everyone, evacuate!

443
00:26:25,544 --> 00:26:27,004
-[child crying] Mommy!
-Leave it.

444
00:26:27,087 --> 00:26:28,422
-We gotta go. Come on!
-No!

445
00:26:28,505 --> 00:26:31,008
[Hopkins] I said get her
in the car now. Let's go.

446
00:26:32,634 --> 00:26:34,053
-Do you have a car?
-[person 5] No.

447
00:26:34,136 --> 00:26:37,223
Go get in that white truck. Hurry
up. Let's go. Hold on tight.

448
00:26:37,306 --> 00:26:38,307
Go!

449
00:26:38,390 --> 00:26:41,143
[people screaming]

450
00:26:43,312 --> 00:26:45,105
IC, Utility 2136.

451
00:26:45,606 --> 00:26:48,442
Be advised, we need medics
for multiple burn injuries.

452
00:26:49,026 --> 00:26:50,277
I'm starting a convoy.

453
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:52,113
We're heading out
on Concow Road.

454
00:26:52,196 --> 00:26:54,573
Follow me! Stay close!

455
00:26:54,656 --> 00:26:56,367
Everyone, follow each other!

456
00:26:56,450 --> 00:26:58,619
Everyone, hang on, okay?

457
00:26:58,702 --> 00:27:00,704
-Let's go.
-[engine revs]

458

[horns honking]

459
00:27:19,681 --> 00:27:21,100
-Hello?
-[clerk] Do you have any questions

460
00:27:21,183 --> 00:27:22,184
-about...
-Hello?

461
00:27:22,267 --> 00:27:23,686
[clerk] I'll be with
you in a moment.

462
00:27:23,769 --> 00:27:24,853
[Kevin] Okay.

463
00:27:25,437 --> 00:27:27,898
-Uh...
-Sounds good. And they are chewable.

464
00:27:28,565 --> 00:27:29,483
You can eat that.

465
00:27:29,566 --> 00:27:31,277
-That I don't think is a good idea.
-[sighs]

466
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:32,361
Okay.

467
00:27:32,444 --> 00:27:35,489
Ma'am, my son, uh... [stammers] He's
got a fever, and he's throwing up.

468
00:27:35,572 --> 00:27:36,490
I was on the phone.

469
00:27:36,573 --> 00:27:37,825
-Uh, your son, how old is he?
-Sure.

470
00:27:37,908 --> 00:27:38,909
Fourteen.

471
00:27:38,992 --> 00:27:41,120
-Um, does he have any allergies?
-He's 15, actually.

472
00:27:41,203 --> 00:27:42,496
Yeah. He's 15. No, uh...

473
00:27:42,579 --> 00:27:45,708
-[stammers] I don't know.
-Food intolerances or anything like that?

474
00:27:45,791 --> 00:27:47,334
[stammers] I don't think so. No.

475
00:27:47,417 --> 00:27:50,629
Whatever the standard thing is
for-for-for fever and throwing up.

476
00:27:50,712 --> 00:27:51,547
Okay. Sounds like

477
00:27:51,630 --> 00:27:53,132
-Tylenol would be your best bet.
-Yeah.

478
00:27:53,215 --> 00:27:54,049
Great. Thank you.

479
00:27:54,132 --> 00:27:56,302
[clerk] Great. These
are going for $7.25.

480
00:27:56,385 --> 00:27:58,304
-[Kevin] Okay. All right.
-[phone ringing]

481
00:27:58,387 --> 00:28:00,222
-I'll be right there, Linda.
-Would you like a bag?

482
00:28:00,305 --> 00:28:01,932
[Kevin] No. That's good.
You can keep the change.

483
00:28:02,015 --> 00:28:02,850
S-Sir, I can...

484
00:28:02,933 --> 00:28:05,770
-Yeah. Go ahead. Huh? No.
-[Linda] <i>What's going on, Kevin?</i>

485
00:28:05,853 --> 00:28:07,730
<i>Shaun's been messaging.
Says he wants to come home.</i>

486
00:28:07,813 --> 00:28:09,523
-No.
-<i>He says he wants me to come get him.</i>

487
00:28:09,606 --> 00:28:11,776
-No. That... That's ridiculous.
-<i>Well, he sounds upset.</i>

488
00:28:11,859 --> 00:28:12,943
-<i>What happened?</i>
-Nothing.

489
00:28:13,026 --> 00:28:15,571
We had a little misunderstanding.
I thought he was cutting class.

490
00:28:15,654 --> 00:28:17,239
-<i>Well, was he?</i>
-[pants] Was he what?

491
00:28:17,322 --> 00:28:18,908
-<i>Was he cutting class?</i>
-No.

492
00:28:18,991 --> 00:28:21,994
[exhales deeply] It was my mistake.
He's actually got a stomach flu.

493
00:28:22,077 --> 00:28:24,205
But look, I just picked up some
Tylenol, so everything's fine.

494
00:28:24,288 --> 00:28:27,708
<i>It's not fine, Kevin. Not if he's
ill and saying he wants to come home.</i>

495
00:28:27,791 --> 00:28:29,543
I don't have time for
this right now, Linda.

gonna continue in this wind.

<i>Do you copy? We can't stop it.</i>

664

[students clamoring]

665
00:37:39,176 --> 00:37:41,428
[teacher] Okay. Mary's
class, sit down.

666
00:37:43,931 --> 00:37:44,932
Class,

667
00:37:45,432 --> 00:37:47,893
we don't all need to
look out the window.

668
00:37:47,976 --> 00:37:51,146
It's just another brush fire.
Nothing new. Come sit down.

669
00:37:51,772 --> 00:37:52,856
Take out a book.

670
00:38:00,239 --> 00:38:02,700
-Do we know what we're doing?
-Still no evacuation order.

671
00:38:02,783 --> 00:38:03,951
I'm not waiting.

672
00:38:04,034 --> 00:38:07,830
Okay, let's just get everyone out of
here and home as quickly as we can.

673
00:38:07,913 --> 00:38:09,665
Okay, I'll send an
email to parents.

674
00:38:09,748 --> 00:38:13,502
If any of your students have
phones or know their numbers,

675
00:38:13,585 --> 00:38:15,421
-get the parents to collect.
-Okay, but...

676
00:38:15,504 --> 00:38:17,923
but some of my kids have
parents who work out of town,

677
00:38:18,006 --> 00:38:21,010
and the parents will never get here in
time. What do we do about those kids?

678
00:38:21,093 --> 00:38:24,054
Okay. [stutters] I'm sure they're gonna
have an alternative collection point.

679
00:38:24,137 --> 00:38:26,974
So, let's just gather together the
students who can't be collected.

680
00:38:27,057 --> 00:38:28,851
And I'll just keep
trying Town Hall.

681
00:38:28,934 --> 00:38:30,311
[teacher] Okay. Thank you.

682
00:38:30,394 --> 00:38:31,562
Okay, um...

683
00:38:32,187 --> 00:38:34,982

mom's phone number?

684
00:38:35,065 --> 00:38:36,358
-Uh-huh.
-You do?

685
00:38:36,900 --> 00:38:38,569
-Great. F...
-435-232...

686
00:38:38,652 --> 00:38:41,488
Okay. Hold on one second. I'm
gonna ask you to write it down.

687
00:38:42,114 --> 00:38:44,241
Who else knows their mom
or dad's phone number?

00:38:46,243 --> 00:38:48,412
-[Kevin] Yeah?
-[Linda] <i>You said you'd call me back.</i>

690
00:38:48,495 --> 00:38:49,663
[Kevin] I'm sorry.
I got distracted.

fight every week.</i>

693
00:38:54,418 --> 00:38:56,629
We don't need to argue, Lin.
There's nothing to argue about.

694
00:38:56,712 --> 00:38:59,131
Okay. [stutters] I didn't
realize our son was sick.

695
00:38:59,214 --> 00:39:02,176
It was an honest mistake. [stutters]
You don't need to get involved.

696
00:39:02,259 --> 00:39:04,470
-<i>Then why is he calling me?</i>
-[siren wailing]

697
00:39:04,553 --> 00:39:06,722
[Kevin] I don't
know! Linda, he's 15!

698
00:39:06,805 --> 00:39:09,058
He got in a fight with his
dad, and he's calling his mom.

699
00:39:09,141 --> 00:39:12,186
Don't make this a bigger deal than it
is. [stutters] I'm dealing with it.

-[horns honking]

[Linda] <i>Face it, Kevin.
You're just... unreliable.</i>

704
00:39:24,573 --> 00:39:26,909
No. No, [stutters] I'm not
doing this right now, Lin.

705
00:39:26,992 --> 00:39:30,370
I'm not gonna sit here and go over all
the ways that I screwed up with you.

706
00:39:32,623 --> 00:39:33,957
Listen, it's been tough...

707
00:39:35,209 --> 00:39:36,293
lately with Dad dying.

708
00:39:37,002 --> 00:39:39,046

your dad as an excuse.</i>

you barely spoke to him for 20 years.</i>

<i>He ruined your life.</i>

711
00:39:44,009 --> 00:39:45,344
<i>That's what you told me!</i>

712
00:39:45,427 --> 00:39:46,845
That's bullshit, Linda.

713
00:39:48,639 --> 00:39:50,224
That's bullshit.
That's a low blow.

[Linda] <i>I'm sorry.</i>

715
00:39:56,063 --> 00:39:57,147
<i>That wasn't nice.</i>

<i>It's just the first weekend I've
been away with anyone since we...</i>

717
00:40:03,070 --> 00:40:04,154

<i>All I'm saying is I know
it's been hard for you,</i>

722
00:40:18,335 --> 00:40:20,254
<i>but you gotta think about Shaun.</i>

723
00:40:21,129 --> 00:40:23,799
<i>He looks at you, and
all he sees is...</i>

724
00:40:23,882 --> 00:40:25,050
What?

725
00:40:26,677 --> 00:40:28,429
What does he see
when he looks at me?

726
00:40:28,512 --> 00:40:31,307
-<i>Don't make me say it, Kevin.</i>
-No, go ahead, say it. Say it.

-Say it.

This is an important update.

753
00:42:11,198 --> 00:42:14,827
We are now evacuating
East Paradise only.

-[worker] What zones?
-[Ruby] East Paradise zones 3, 8 and 14.

That is 3, 8 and 14 only.

<i>Any driver east of Clark
all the way to Pentz,</i>

757
00:42:27,339 --> 00:42:29,341
<i>you need to evacuate
that area immediately.</i>

758
00:42:29,424 --> 00:42:33,053
<i>They're worried about the fire
coming across the canyon from Concow.</i>

759
00:42:33,136 --> 00:42:35,055
<i>So if you have any
children on board,</i>

760
00:42:35,138 --> 00:42:39,977
<i>you need to take them west all the
way out of town to the Chico depot.</i>

All right, let's, um...

767
00:43:01,707 --> 00:43:02,917
I'll be right back.

768
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:05,252
All right, so we
got the evac order.

769
00:43:05,335 --> 00:43:08,255
Apparently, their system went down,
and they weren't able to get it out.

770
00:43:08,338 --> 00:43:10,800
They want every student who
hasn't already been collected

771
00:43:10,883 --> 00:43:13,302
to be taken over to
Paradise Elementary.

772
00:43:13,385 --> 00:43:14,970
Okay? That's the new
collection point.

773
00:43:15,053 --> 00:43:16,555
That's where they're
sending all the parents.

774
00:43:16,638 --> 00:43:19,183
Okay. Well, we have 23
kids without transport.

775
00:43:19,266 --> 00:43:21,102
So how are we gonna
get them there?

776
00:43:21,185 --> 00:43:22,853

take four in my car.

-No, no.

them there by ourselves.

779
00:43:28,775 --> 00:43:30,277
We don't have enough cars.

00:43:30,360 --> 00:43:31,737
-[principal] Yes.
-They need to send us a bus.

781

-Call Ruby.
-Oh, yeah. I'll call the depot.

782

Hi, Anna. It's, um... It's Mary.

Paradise, and I can't get to Jake.

And I was wondering if
you could go get him,

786
00:43:49,004 --> 00:43:51,215
and then I'll just get
to you as soon as I can.

787
00:43:51,298 --> 00:43:52,716
Um, okay. Thank you.

788

-Yes, ma'am.

We are gonna get a bus
right out to you, okay?

803
00:44:27,376 --> 00:44:29,044
So you just sit tight. Okay?

804
00:44:29,670 --> 00:44:30,671
Thank you so much.

00:45:18,594 --> 00:45:20,179
[Ruby] <i>No, 922.
Do not swing back.</i>

823
00:45:20,262 --> 00:45:21,847
<i>Once you get out of
there, you get out.</i>

824
00:45:21,930 --> 00:45:24,266
<i>Those roads are gonna get
real crazy real quick, okay?</i>

825
00:45:24,349 --> 00:45:27,853
<i>Is there anybody in East
Paradise with an empty bus</i>

826
00:45:27,936 --> 00:45:29,855
<i>that can go and
pick these kids up?</i>

827
00:45:34,985 --> 00:45:36,820
No. No.

828
00:45:40,282 --> 00:45:41,283
[sighs]

829
00:45:49,666 --> 00:45:51,293
963 to Base, I can get 'em.

830
00:45:55,464 --> 00:45:56,549
Kevin, is that you?

831
00:45:56,632 --> 00:45:57,716
Yeah.

832
00:45:58,467 --> 00:46:00,386
Yeah, I'm still on this
side of town. Remember?

833
00:46:00,469 --> 00:46:01,553
I was running late.

834
00:46:03,472 --> 00:46:04,390
Yep, yep. I remember.

835
00:46:04,473 --> 00:46:06,642
So, uh, we can do maintenance
another day, okay?

836
00:46:07,976 --> 00:46:10,146
Listen, if you get those kids
out, you will have done well.

837
00:46:10,229 --> 00:46:11,980
Okay, Kevin? You copy?

838
00:46:14,233 --> 00:46:16,318
Copy that. Have them lined up.

839
00:46:17,069 --> 00:46:18,153
I'm on my way.

840

846
00:47:09,705 --> 00:47:12,124
Stay sitting please, everybody.

[grunts]

849
00:47:18,338 --> 00:47:19,840
[Kevin] Twenty kids for evac?

850
00:47:20,507 --> 00:47:22,843
They're in there.
Around to the right.

851
00:47:27,639 --> 00:47:28,808
-[Kevin] Hi.
-[Mary] Hi.

852
00:47:28,891 --> 00:47:31,644
-Are you here for the kids?
-Yes, I am. Are they... Are they ready?

853
00:47:31,727 --> 00:47:33,395
Um, yep. We're gathering
them up right now.

854
00:47:33,478 --> 00:47:34,647
-[Kevin] Okay.
-Um, what's your name?

855
00:47:34,730 --> 00:47:36,857
-Kevin. And, uh...
-Kevin, hi. I'm Mary.

856
00:47:36,940 --> 00:47:40,027
-Hi. As soon as we can gather...
-Yeah, great. We are...

857
00:47:40,110 --> 00:47:42,488
-We're gonna get 'em in line in a minute.
-Yeah.

858
00:47:42,571 --> 00:47:44,990
These kids, their parents couldn't
make it 'cause they work too...

859
00:47:45,073 --> 00:47:47,243
-Paradise Elementary. Got it.
-Right. The alternative drop-off.

860
00:47:47,326 --> 00:47:48,577
Yep. Got it. Ready to go.

861
00:47:48,660 --> 00:47:50,663
-Principal Hayes. Thank you for coming.
-Hi. Yep.

862
00:47:50,746 --> 00:47:52,081
-Okay...
-Sooner the better.

863
00:47:52,164 --> 00:47:53,999
...and we're just gonna
keep it calm for the kids.

864
00:47:54,082 --> 00:47:57,837
Kids, this is our bus driver,
Kevin. Can we say hi to Kevin?

865
00:47:57,920 --> 00:47:59,505
[students] Hi, Kevin.

866
00:47:59,588 --> 00:48:01,841
[Mary] Can I get you
in two straight lines?

867
00:48:01,924 --> 00:48:03,759
Shortest in the front.
Tallest in the back.

868
00:48:03,842 --> 00:48:07,972
And Kevin is gonna drive
you to Paradise Elementary,

869
00:48:08,055 --> 00:48:11,308
where your parents are
going to pick you up.

870
00:48:11,391 --> 00:48:13,144
I'm gonna lead the
line, Principal.

871
00:48:13,227 --> 00:48:16,230
If you could please take the back
and do a head count while we walk.

872
00:48:16,313 --> 00:48:18,441
If you're ready,
raise your hand.

873
00:48:18,524 --> 00:48:20,109
Let me see your
eyes. Eyes on me.

874
00:48:20,192 --> 00:48:21,610
I want to see everybody's eyes.

875
00:48:21,693 --> 00:48:23,028
-Are we ready?
-[students] Yes.

876
00:48:23,111 --> 00:48:26,031
[Mary] We're gonna walk calmly.
We're gonna walk slowly.

877
00:48:26,114 --> 00:48:27,575
We're gonna stay
with our partners.

878
00:48:27,658 --> 00:48:29,743
-Okay, here we go.
-[Kevin] Yeah. Come on.

879
00:48:34,248 --> 00:48:37,501
-What do you think, like, ten minutes?
-Uh, yeah, if we get a move on, yes.

880
00:48:37,584 --> 00:48:40,463
But the traffic's getting really busy
out there. So the quicker, the better.

881
00:48:40,546 --> 00:48:42,130
Okay. We have time.

882
00:48:42,798 --> 00:48:43,758
Well, you know, ma'am,

883
00:48:43,841 --> 00:48:46,635
I don't think you understand the
urgency of our situation here.

884
00:48:46,718 --> 00:48:49,054
I recognize the urgency
of our situation.

885
00:48:49,137 --> 00:48:50,556
And it's Mary, not "ma'am."

886
00:48:50,639 --> 00:48:52,725
Hoods up if you have a hood!

887
00:48:52,808 --> 00:48:55,143
If you have a backpack,
put it on top.

888
00:48:56,061 --> 00:48:59,523
-[students clamoring, screaming]
-Okay! It's okay! It's okay! It's okay!

889
00:48:59,606 --> 00:49:03,193
It's just a fire engine in the
sky! Use your backpacks, okay?

890
00:49:03,694 --> 00:49:04,778
All right.

891
00:49:06,154 --> 00:49:07,573
Find a seat on the bus, babe.

892
00:49:08,448 --> 00:49:10,325
Quietly, calmly,
one single line.

893
00:49:11,034 --> 00:49:13,036
Not quickly, take your time.

894
00:49:15,205 --> 00:49:16,582
[Kevin] 963 to Base,

895
00:49:17,124 --> 00:49:19,293
we're loading the
kids on the bus now.

896
00:49:19,376 --> 00:49:20,628
[students chattering]

897
00:49:20,711 --> 00:49:23,964
[Kevin] The signal's bad. I'll let
you know when we're clear, over.

898
00:49:25,048 --> 00:49:29,095
Everybody, I want you to stay seated
and listen to everything Kevin says.

899
00:49:29,178 --> 00:49:31,347
-Okay?
-W-Wait, wait, wait!

900
00:49:31,430 --> 00:49:32,723
Alex! I need Alex!

901
00:49:32,806 --> 00:49:35,059
-Alex? Alex, honey, your mom is here.
-Alex!

902
00:49:35,142 --> 00:49:36,519
Okay, you have all your things?

903
00:49:36,602 --> 00:49:38,062
-You gotta go. Okay.
-Oh, thank God.

904
00:49:38,145 --> 00:49:39,814
Let's go. Let's go. Let's go.

905
00:49:39,897 --> 00:49:40,981
[Mary] Okay, you are good to go.

906
00:49:41,064 --> 00:49:43,067
[Kevin] Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Ma'am, ma'am. Whoa, whoa, whoa.

907
00:49:43,150 --> 00:49:44,610
No, no. Y-You're coming. Yes.

908
00:49:44,693 --> 00:49:47,279
No. No. [stammers]
I have to lock up.

909
00:49:47,362 --> 00:49:49,240
No, no, no, no.
Y-You can't. I...

910
00:49:49,323 --> 00:49:50,866
I'm gonna drive and drop. Okay?

911
00:49:50,949 --> 00:49:53,369
I can't hang about and hold
any hands when I get there.

912
00:49:53,452 --> 00:49:55,621
I've got my own family
I gotta get home to.

913
00:49:55,704 --> 00:49:57,080
Okay? You gotta come.

914
00:49:58,415 --> 00:50:01,502
I-I don't think he can do this by
himself. I have to go with him.

915
00:50:01,585 --> 00:50:03,212
-[Kevin] Pipe down!
-It's fine.

916
00:50:03,295 --> 00:50:05,589
[stutters] I'll get a ride
from one of the teachers there.

917
00:50:05,672 --> 00:50:08,509
-Here, take the evac for HQ.
-You okay to lock up alone?

918
00:50:08,592 --> 00:50:10,136
-Yeah.
-All right. I'm here. I'm here.

919
00:50:10,219 --> 00:50:12,304
-I'm coming.
-[students cheering]

920
00:50:13,847 --> 00:50:15,266
-We're good.
-[Kevin] Hang on.

921
00:50:15,349 --> 00:50:17,226
[Mary] We got on the bus.
We're gonna be there.

922
00:50:17,309 --> 00:50:19,311
It's gonna take ten minutes.

923
00:50:19,394 --> 00:50:20,979
Did you see those fire engines?

924
00:50:25,108 --> 00:50:28,362
Okay, um, here is the
school's evac route.

925
00:50:30,864 --> 00:50:35,369
We are... the East line, so we're
gonna stay on Pentz all the way down,

926
00:50:35,452 --> 00:50:38,456
and then cut a right on Pearson
to get us to Paradise Elementary.

927
00:50:38,539 --> 00:50:41,292
[stutters] I don't-I don't think
it's a good idea. L-Look at it.

928
00:50:41,375 --> 00:50:43,586
[stutters] T-There's a better
way out than Pentz right.

929
00:50:43,669 --> 00:50:46,338
Okay, but that's the plan. So
we're gonna stick to the plan.

930
00:50:46,421 --> 00:50:48,007
Whatever you say, teach.

931
00:50:48,090 --> 00:50:49,842
-[helicopter whirring]
-[chattering on radio]

932
00:50:49,925 --> 00:50:53,596
It's total gridlock. Look how
tight those roads are right now.

933
00:50:53,679 --> 00:50:56,974
It's gotta be at least 15 miles
of traffic trying to get to Chico.

934
00:50:57,057 --> 00:50:59,310
[pilot] Chief, we're
arriving at the fairgrounds.

935
00:50:59,393 --> 00:51:00,393
[chief] Copy that.

936
00:51:19,162 --> 00:51:21,540
I'm issuing a mandatory
evacuation on the whole town.

937
00:51:21,623 --> 00:51:23,292
All zones. Effective
immediately.

938
00:51:23,375 --> 00:51:25,252
Chief, you can't do
it. It'll be chaos.

939
00:51:25,335 --> 00:51:27,129
We're talking 26,000 people.

940
00:51:27,212 --> 00:51:28,798
If you get everyone
moving out of town,

941
00:51:28,881 --> 00:51:30,299
you're never gonna
get your engines in.

942
00:51:30,382 --> 00:51:32,384
You're not listening. The
fire's coming across the canyon.

943
00:51:32,467 --> 00:51:34,470
I've seen it with my own
eyes. It's moving fast.

944
00:51:34,553 --> 00:51:35,387
Here's the choice,

945
00:51:35,470 --> 00:51:37,973
bust the system or play by
the book and everybody dies.

946
00:51:38,056 --> 00:51:39,517
You want that on
your conscience?

947
00:51:39,600 --> 00:51:41,977
[chattering]

948
00:51:42,060 --> 00:51:43,896
Chief, we got the team
ordered early for ya.

949
00:51:43,979 --> 00:51:45,063
-Copy.
-All right.

950
00:51:48,108 --> 00:51:50,861
Hey, Chief. Chief.
Mark Rogers of PG&E.

951
00:51:50,944 --> 00:51:53,030
I have a team here from
headquarters. We're available.

952
00:51:53,113 --> 00:51:55,533
Just get the power off in the town,
and we'll take care of the rest.

953
00:51:55,616 --> 00:51:56,700
-Yeah.
-[firefighter] Okay, listen.

954
00:51:56,783 --> 00:51:59,286
We gotta give the chief some space.
We will come to you in a second.

955
00:51:59,369 --> 00:52:01,830
Just... No, just wanted to say
we're available if you need us.

956
00:52:04,208 --> 00:52:06,377
Issue mandatory evac
order for the entire town.

957
00:52:06,460 --> 00:52:08,295
[firefighter] Copy,
Chief. Oroville, Camp Ops.

958
00:52:08,378 --> 00:52:11,215
Base to 179, 179. Are you clear?

959
00:52:11,298 --> 00:52:12,799
Are you out of East Paradise?

960
00:52:13,800 --> 00:52:16,137
-[bus driver] <i>179. We're out.</i>
-[Ruby] Great, great.

961
00:52:16,220 --> 00:52:17,304
Who's left?

962
00:52:18,096 --> 00:52:19,765
963 is the only one left.

963
00:52:20,641 --> 00:52:21,642
That's all.

964
00:52:23,101 --> 00:52:24,186
Base to 963.

965
00:52:24,728 --> 00:52:27,231
Base to 963, are you
out of East Paradise?

966

[horns honking]

968
00:52:34,321 --> 00:52:35,406
[Kevin] 963 to Base.

969
00:52:35,489 --> 00:52:37,574
[sighs] Do you read?

970
00:52:38,825 --> 00:52:41,954
[Mary] Don't be scared. The-The fire
trucks are responding to the fire.

971
00:52:42,037 --> 00:52:43,914
-They're doing their job.
-[Kevin] Anybody, 963 to Base.

972
00:52:43,997 --> 00:52:45,749
-They're keeping us safe.
-[Kevin] Can anybody hear me?

973
00:52:45,832 --> 00:52:49,170
Okay? We are on Pentz. It
is backed up going nowhere.

974
00:52:49,253 --> 00:52:51,756
963, come in please.

975
00:52:51,839 --> 00:52:53,090
Can you try his mobile?

976
00:52:57,427 --> 00:53:00,306
Why does he have to be the last
bus out of there? I swear to God.

977
00:53:00,389 --> 00:53:02,391
[Kevin] 963 to
Base, do you read?

978
00:53:03,684 --> 00:53:06,103
Let me know if you're
getting this. Over.

979
00:53:08,063 --> 00:53:10,065
Do you have any safety
protocols on this bus?

980
00:53:10,148 --> 00:53:11,567
[Kevin] Yep. You got this,

981
00:53:12,609 --> 00:53:13,861
and you got that.

982
00:53:15,153 --> 00:53:17,615
Great. Yeah. That'll
make all the difference.

983
00:53:17,698 --> 00:53:19,783
[siren wailing]

984
00:53:23,620 --> 00:53:24,621
So you're new here?

985
00:53:25,372 --> 00:53:27,124
No, I just came back
a few months ago.

986
00:53:27,624 --> 00:53:28,793
Grew up here.

987
00:53:28,876 --> 00:53:31,003
Oh. What's that like?

988
00:53:32,171 --> 00:53:34,673
[groans] Not where I
thought I'd be at 44.

989
00:53:36,633 --> 00:53:38,469
How long do you think
this is gonna take?

990
00:53:38,552 --> 00:53:39,428
Hard to tell.

991
00:53:39,511 --> 00:53:42,014
If we'd have left the school on time,
you wouldn't have slow played me,

992
00:53:42,097 --> 00:53:45,017
it would have taken about ten minutes,
but now it's looking like 20-30.

993
00:53:46,018 --> 00:53:48,228
Guess we'll get there when
we get there. Okay, kiddies.

994
00:53:49,605 --> 00:53:54,777
Let's, um, raise some of these
windows so the smoke doesn't get in.

995
00:53:54,860 --> 00:53:56,904
-[sirens wailing]
-[Ruby] <i>Hi. Is this fire command?</i>

996
00:53:56,987 --> 00:54:00,282
<i>This is Ruby Bishop at PUSD. I've
lost all radio communication,</i>

997
00:54:00,365 --> 00:54:01,700
<i>and I have a lost bus.</i>

998
00:54:01,783 --> 00:54:04,537
<i>It's number 963, and it's over
somewhere in East Paradise.</i>

999
00:54:04,620 --> 00:54:06,622
Can you let me know if
your engines see him?

1000
00:54:06,705 --> 00:54:07,540
Thank you.

1001
00:54:07,623 --> 00:54:10,000
Okay, okay. Okay, uh...

1002
00:54:10,083 --> 00:54:11,919
963, do you read?

1003
00:54:12,002 --> 00:54:13,086
[static on radio]

1004
00:54:13,921 --> 00:54:16,424
Kevin? Can you... Can you
hear me? This is Base.

1005
00:54:16,507 --> 00:54:19,176
[static on radio]

1006
00:54:19,259 --> 00:54:20,719
[Mary] Honey, let's, um...

1007
00:54:21,303 --> 00:54:23,889
move this up so
smoke doesn't get in.

1008
00:54:24,890 --> 00:54:26,434
-What's your name?
-Benjamin.

1009
00:54:26,517 --> 00:54:29,937
Benjamin, and you're in Miss Kristy's
class? That's right. I remember that.

1010
00:54:31,104 --> 00:54:32,731
[student] Miss Mary,
there's another window.

1011
00:54:32,814 --> 00:54:34,983
[Mary stammers] Yes.
Let's get that one.

1012
00:54:38,237 --> 00:54:39,863
Screw this.

1013
00:54:41,281 --> 00:54:42,950
-[students screaming]
-Kevin!

1014
00:54:43,825 --> 00:54:45,661
What are you doing? The
plan is to stay on Pentz!

1015
00:54:45,744 --> 00:54:48,831
Turning over to Clark. It runs parallel.
It's bound to be moving better.

1016
00:54:48,914 --> 00:54:50,040
[Mary] But that's not the plan.

1017
00:54:50,123 --> 00:54:52,418
-The plan is to stay on Pentz.
-Screw the plan, teach.

1018
00:54:52,501 --> 00:54:53,335
You know what?

1019
00:54:53,418 --> 00:54:54,253
Hey, I could stay here

1020
00:54:54,336 --> 00:54:56,130
in the middle of the traffic
jam if that's what you want.

1021
00:54:56,213 --> 00:54:57,965
-Don't stop now, obviously.
-Want me to stay here?

1022
00:54:58,048 --> 00:54:59,550
No shit. Let me drive.

1023
00:55:02,886 --> 00:55:05,389
-What the hell is your problem?
-Look, you see that fire?

1024
00:55:05,472 --> 00:55:07,558
It's like the fucking
Fourth of July, okay?

1025
00:55:07,641 --> 00:55:09,935
I'd sit down if I were you.
I'm about to take a hard left.

1026
00:55:10,018 --> 00:55:11,687
-Bunch down, everybody!
-[Mary] Hold on!

1027
00:55:11,770 --> 00:55:13,772
[students screaming]

1028
00:55:15,107 --> 00:55:17,943
Oh, my God! Oh, my
God! Hold on, kids!

1029
00:55:21,613 --> 00:55:23,949
-Oh, my God! Kevin!
-[fire truck horn blares]

1030
00:55:24,032 --> 00:55:25,618
-[Kevin yells]
-Hold on!

1031
00:55:25,701 --> 00:55:28,787
-[students clamoring]
-Jesus. Jesus Christ.

1032
00:55:29,538 --> 00:55:31,457
-[Kevin] We're clear.
-[Mary] Is everyone okay?

1033
00:55:31,540 --> 00:55:34,418
[students chattering]

1034
00:55:34,501 --> 00:55:36,753
We're okay. Traffic is moving.

1035
00:55:37,337 --> 00:55:39,590
Can you please ask before you
do something like that again?

1036
00:55:39,673 --> 00:55:41,509
You wanna get there quicker
or you wanna go by the book?

1037
00:55:41,592 --> 00:55:43,219
We have to be responsible.

1038
00:55:43,302 --> 00:55:46,514
Yep, and I think that means getting these
kids to their parents as soon as possible.

1039
00:55:46,597 --> 00:55:47,681
Don't you?

1040
00:55:48,390 --> 00:55:49,391
[sighs]

1041
00:55:53,937 --> 00:55:55,105
[inhales sharply]

1042
00:56:00,444 --> 00:56:02,655
-I'm not getting anything.
-Kevin, come in please.

1043
00:56:02,738 --> 00:56:03,739
[alarm beeps]

1044
00:56:03,822 --> 00:56:07,326
[electronic voice] <i>This is a code red
alert. Evacuate all zones immediately.</i>

1045
00:56:07,409 --> 00:56:09,495
[technician] Ruby, we gotta
go. I gotta get the power off.

1046
00:56:09,578 --> 00:56:10,996
-[Ruby] I know.
-I'm getting my guys outta here.

1047
00:56:11,079 --> 00:56:13,916
[Ruby] Okay, okay. Uh,
take my keys. Okay?

1048
00:56:17,336 --> 00:56:20,131
963, do you read?

1049
00:56:20,214 --> 00:56:22,299

1050
00:56:24,218 --> 00:56:25,302

[sighs]

1052
00:56:34,269 --> 00:56:35,270
[sighs]

1053
00:56:36,772 --> 00:56:38,452
So, what about you?
You always lived here?

1054
00:56:39,691 --> 00:56:43,195
[sighs] Yeah. Born and raised.

1055
00:56:44,780 --> 00:56:46,031
Never was really my speed.

1056
00:56:47,616 --> 00:56:48,951
Then why'd you come back?

1057
00:56:49,993 --> 00:56:51,495
My dad died a few months ago.

1058
00:56:53,288 --> 00:56:55,290
-Sorry.
-[Kevin] Nah, it's fine.

1059
00:56:57,084 --> 00:56:58,293
We weren't close.

1060
00:57:03,507 --> 00:57:04,425
So you staying?

1061
00:57:04,508 --> 00:57:06,552
-[siren wailing]
-For now.

1062
00:57:11,640 --> 00:57:13,475
What about you? Got family?

1063
00:57:15,644 --> 00:57:16,812
Yeah.

1064
00:57:16,895 --> 00:57:18,438
Married 19 years.

1065
00:57:19,147 --> 00:57:21,400
A Paradise poster
family too, huh?

1066
00:57:21,483 --> 00:57:23,902
[scoffs] Yeah.

1067
00:57:25,028 --> 00:57:26,363
-One kid.
-[Kevin] Hmm.

1068
00:57:26,947 --> 00:57:29,366
Jake. He's 15.

1069
00:57:30,576 --> 00:57:32,578
I was gonna go get him, but...

1070
00:57:37,541 --> 00:57:39,710
[sighs] I didn't realize. Sorry.

1071
00:57:40,460 --> 00:57:41,712
[Mary] It's fine.

1072
00:57:41,795 --> 00:57:43,631
My sister will
have gone for him.

1073
00:57:43,714 --> 00:57:45,048
His dad's out of town.

1074
00:57:46,258 --> 00:57:47,259
[sighs]

1075
00:57:49,386 --> 00:57:50,471
It'll be fine.

1076
00:57:50,554 --> 00:57:53,265
We're gonna drop the kids off,
and then I'll go find him.

1077
00:57:54,474 --> 00:57:56,644
-All right. How're we doing?
-[student 1] Are we gonna be okay?

1078
00:57:56,727 --> 00:57:58,062
[Mary] Yes. We're
gonna be okay, sweetie.

1079
00:57:58,145 --> 00:57:59,230
[student 2] Are our pets okay?

1080
00:57:59,313 --> 00:58:01,315
[student 3] When will
we see our parents?

1081
00:58:01,398 --> 00:58:03,150
[Mary] We'll see
them there, yeah?

1082
00:58:03,901 --> 00:58:06,821
We're just trying to get you to
safety as soon as we can, okay?

1083
00:58:06,904 --> 00:58:08,364
-[cries]
-Yes, sweetie?

1084
00:58:08,447 --> 00:58:10,491
[student 4] When are
we going to be there?

1085
00:58:10,574 --> 00:58:13,327
[Mary] We're gonna be there
as soon as we can, okay?

1086
00:58:14,494 --> 00:58:15,621
You okay, sweetie?

1087
00:58:15,704 --> 00:58:16,831
Mm-hmm.

1088
00:58:16,914 --> 00:58:18,666
Do you want to sit up
front with somebody else,

1089
00:58:18,749 --> 00:58:20,334
or do you want to
be by yourself?

1090
00:58:21,502 --> 00:58:24,463
[Ruby] <i>Kevin, if you can hear me,
they're evacuating the whole town,</i>

mustering 15 miles away</i>

-<i>at Chico Fairgrounds where it's safe.</i>
-[horn honking]

1093
00:58:29,676 --> 00:58:31,887
Do not drop those kids off.

1094
00:58:31,970 --> 00:58:35,057
Just take 'em and
come to Chico. Okay?

1095
00:58:35,140 --> 00:58:37,351
[honking continues]

1096
00:58:38,393 --> 00:58:40,146
[technician] Ruby, we're
outta time. We gotta go.

1097
00:58:40,229 --> 00:58:41,939
-I gotta get my guys out of here.
-Okay!

1098

00:58:43,357 --> 00:58:45,067
[honking continues]

1100
00:58:45,150 --> 00:58:48,737
Kevin, if you can hear me, I
will see you in Chico, okay?

1101
00:58:49,780 --> 00:58:50,698
Be careful. Base clear.

1102
00:58:50,781 --> 00:58:53,617
[honking continues]

1103
00:58:53,700 --> 00:58:54,785
[worker] Come on!

1104
00:59:07,548 --> 00:59:10,259
[firefighter] <i>Chief, the fire's
spreading fast through East Paradise.</i>

1105
00:59:10,342 --> 00:59:11,510
<i>And I just got word
from Division Hotel.</i>

1106
00:59:11,593 --> 00:59:14,805
<i>You got a working fire in the cardiology
wing at Feather River Hospital.</i>

1107
00:59:14,888 --> 00:59:16,265
<i>It's well established
in the attic.</i>

1108
00:59:16,348 --> 00:59:18,642
You got about 15 to 20 patients
that are outside right now.

1109
00:59:18,725 --> 00:59:20,227
We're working on getting
them outta there.

1110
00:59:20,310 --> 00:59:22,563
Do whatever you can in there
and save the hospital, okay?

1111
00:59:22,646 --> 00:59:24,815
Get me Butte medics, and
tell them we need help.

1112
00:59:24,898 --> 00:59:26,859
Chief. Air Attack has
grounded all aircraft.

1113
00:59:26,942 --> 00:59:28,736
Now, I'll get you an
update as soon as I can,

1114
00:59:28,819 --> 00:59:30,529
but right now nothing
goes in the air.

1115
00:59:30,612 --> 00:59:32,030
-Nothing.
-Goddamn it.

1116
00:59:32,990 --> 00:59:35,868
Where are we with the evacuation
route? How's this traffic moving?

[firefighter 2] <i>You can see now

00:59:47,004 --> 00:59:48,631
<i>We're having major
access issues.</i>

1123
00:59:48,714 --> 00:59:51,926
I want any vehicle blocking
traffic pushed off the road.

1124
00:59:52,009 --> 00:59:53,511
Okay? Get dozers in
there if you have to.

1125
00:59:53,594 --> 00:59:54,428
[firefighter 2] Got it.

1126
00:59:54,511 --> 00:59:57,014
[chief] We can't lose
those four routes out.

1127
00:59:57,097 --> 00:59:58,724
We lose those, it's game over.

-Hey, everybody! Listen up! Listen up!
-Everybody, quiet!

1129
01:00:02,686 --> 01:00:04,605
[chief] This is no
longer a wild land fire.

1130
01:00:04,688 --> 01:00:06,023
This is burning home to home.

1131
01:00:06,106 --> 01:00:07,691
This is a town fire.

1132
01:00:07,774 --> 01:00:09,276
This is a mass
casualty incident.

1133
01:00:10,194 --> 01:00:11,821
That's what we're dealing with.

1134
01:00:11,904 --> 01:00:15,116
So stay on with your people,
and do the best you can.

1135
01:00:15,199 --> 01:00:16,992
-Copy, Chief.
-[firefighter 3] Copy that.

Hey! What's the holdup?

1139
01:00:38,472 --> 01:00:40,599
Got a roadblock up ahead!

1140
01:00:41,350 --> 01:00:42,768
The freeway's jammed.

1141
01:00:43,352 --> 01:00:44,395
Shit!

Come on.

1145
01:00:52,694 --> 01:00:54,363
[Mary] Where do
you need to get to?

1146
01:00:55,113 --> 01:00:57,366
-After we drop off the kids.
-Magalia.

1147
01:00:58,325 --> 01:01:00,035
My son's up there
with his grandma.

1148
01:01:00,661 --> 01:01:02,579
I told them I'd be
coming straight home.

1149
01:01:03,121 --> 01:01:04,721
Well, they'll get the
evacuation alerts.

1150
01:01:05,249 --> 01:01:06,542
Won't they?

1151
01:01:08,585 --> 01:01:09,837
You signed up for them, right?

1152
01:01:10,921 --> 01:01:12,005
I...

1153
01:01:16,552 --> 01:01:18,179
You know, I-I kept
getting the noti...

1154
01:01:18,262 --> 01:01:19,805
[sighs] ...notifications
from the town hall

1155
01:01:19,888 --> 01:01:21,390
and I just kept putting it off.

1156
01:01:22,099 --> 01:01:23,767
Well, can his grandma drive?

1157
01:01:24,685 --> 01:01:25,686
Nope.

1158
01:01:26,895 --> 01:01:28,230
[horn honks]

1159
01:01:37,823 --> 01:01:38,908
[student 1] Miss Mary, help.

1160
01:01:38,991 --> 01:01:41,952
[student 2] Miss Mary, there's
smoke coming from that house.

1161
01:01:42,035 --> 01:01:44,038
[students chattering, screaming]

1162
01:01:44,121 --> 01:01:45,372
Fire on the left.

1163
01:01:46,832 --> 01:01:49,418
-Fire on the left. Bunch down.
-[Mary] Stay away from the windows.

1164
01:01:49,501 --> 01:01:51,253
Everybody stay off the windows.

1165
01:01:51,336 --> 01:01:53,589
[horn honking]

1166
01:01:53,672 --> 01:01:54,840
Hey.

1167
01:01:55,924 --> 01:01:57,009
Just let me in!

1168
01:01:57,759 --> 01:01:58,886
Come on!

1169
01:01:58,969 --> 01:02:00,804
Buddy, I got kids on the bus.

1170
01:02:02,681 --> 01:02:05,684
[Mary] Stay calm. Kevin's
trying to get us through.

1171
01:02:06,852 --> 01:02:08,687
Mary, take a seat.

1172
01:02:09,313 --> 01:02:11,065
-What? Why?
-Take a seat. I need you to drive.

1173
01:02:11,148 --> 01:02:12,525
-I need you to drive.
-I don't know how.

1174
01:02:12,608 --> 01:02:15,569
I've gotta clear traffic in the left
lane. I need you to take over the bus.

1175
01:02:15,652 --> 01:02:16,821
It's easy. Okay?

1176
01:02:16,904 --> 01:02:18,823
You put your foot on the brake,
when I say come, hit the gas.

1177
01:02:18,906 --> 01:02:21,617
It's easy. Okay? Yes,
you do. Hold the brake.

1178
01:02:21,700 --> 01:02:23,452
-Okay.
-When I say, "Come on," come on.

1179
01:02:23,535 --> 01:02:24,536
-Okay?
-Okay.

1180
01:02:26,872 --> 01:02:27,956
Stay seated.

1181
01:02:28,749 --> 01:02:29,667
Where's Kevin?

1182
01:02:29,750 --> 01:02:30,959
[officer] Back it up.

1183
01:02:34,046 --> 01:02:37,216
Back this truck up. We gotta
get this fire engine in.

1184
01:02:37,299 --> 01:02:39,801
-Let's go. Keep 'em going!
-Hey, hey, hey. What's going on?

1185
01:02:40,469 --> 01:02:42,471
-What're you doing? What's the plan?
-We got people trapped on Pentz.

1186
01:02:42,554 --> 01:02:43,556
Those people got priority.

1187
01:02:43,639 --> 01:02:45,182
-The main fire's over there.
-See the school bus?

1188
01:02:45,265 --> 01:02:48,185
I have 22 kids on that bus. I gotta
get them to their parents, okay?

1189
01:02:48,268 --> 01:02:49,311
[student] Where's Kevin?

1190
01:02:49,394 --> 01:02:51,188
[Kevin] I need you to hold traffic
here so we can come through.

1191
01:02:51,271 --> 01:02:53,482
I gotta clear this traffic to
let the fire truck through.

1192
01:02:53,565 --> 01:02:55,443
Get on the radio and call
fuckin' backup, will you?

1193
01:02:55,526 --> 01:02:58,696
Our comms are down. They've been
down for about 40 minutes or so.

1194
01:02:58,779 --> 01:03:01,365
Get back in your car. We'll
get you through when we can.

1195
01:03:02,407 --> 01:03:03,825
Get back in your car, sir.

1196
01:03:04,618 --> 01:03:06,162
-Get back in your car.
-[Kevin] Go left.

1197
01:03:06,245 --> 01:03:08,706
We gotta get the fire truck
and this bus through first.

1198
01:03:08,789 --> 01:03:09,873
Go! Go!

1199
01:03:12,751 --> 01:03:14,378
Go, go, go! Go, go, go!

1200
01:03:15,587 --> 01:03:16,588
Hold it!

1201
01:03:17,881 --> 01:03:19,508
-Go!
-[driver yelling]

1202
01:03:19,591 --> 01:03:20,551
Come on.

1203
01:03:20,634 --> 01:03:22,719
-[students clamoring]
-[horns honking]

1204
01:03:23,679 --> 01:03:24,680
Okay.

1205
01:03:25,556 --> 01:03:27,266
Let the fire truck
and the bus through!

1206
01:03:27,349 --> 01:03:28,767
Come on, go, go, go, go!

1207
01:03:29,726 --> 01:03:30,727
Yes.

1208
01:03:31,728 --> 01:03:33,105
Go! Go!

1209
01:03:33,188 --> 01:03:34,356
[students clamoring]

1210
01:03:34,439 --> 01:03:35,858
Come on. Come on!

1211
01:03:35,941 --> 01:03:37,485
I-I don't want to hit you.

1212
01:03:37,568 --> 01:03:38,902
Are we gonna be okay?

1213
01:03:39,903 --> 01:03:40,903
Come on.

1214
01:03:45,492 --> 01:03:48,287
[siren wailing]

1215
01:03:48,370 --> 01:03:49,997
[Mary breathes heavily]

1216
01:03:51,081 --> 01:03:52,082
Come on!

1217
01:03:53,500 --> 01:03:55,002
[pants] Holy shit.

1218
01:03:55,085 --> 01:03:56,170
[Kevin] Yes!

1219
01:04:00,340 --> 01:04:01,675
[Mary] We did it.
We made it through.

1220
01:04:01,758 --> 01:04:03,969
[students cheering]

1221
01:04:07,055 --> 01:04:07,890
What was wrong?

1222
01:04:07,973 --> 01:04:10,058
Radios are down. It's chaos.

1223
01:04:15,439 --> 01:04:17,066
A minute out, minute out.

1224
01:04:17,149 --> 01:04:18,859
Minute out! Are we ready?

1225
01:04:18,942 --> 01:04:23,030
963. We are one minute out from
drop-off. One minute out from drop-off.

1226
01:04:24,781 --> 01:04:26,074
Nice driving.

1227
01:04:28,202 --> 01:04:30,579
Thanks. Not so bad yourself.

1228
01:04:32,206 --> 01:04:33,207
[exhales]

1229
01:04:33,832 --> 01:04:35,709
You could always
be a traffic cop

1230
01:04:37,127 --> 01:04:38,754
if you're looking
for a fresh start.

1231
01:04:39,838 --> 01:04:41,590
I'd take a hard pass on that.

1232
01:04:41,673 --> 01:04:42,758
[chuckles]

1233
01:04:43,509 --> 01:04:44,510
[sighs]

1234
01:04:52,392 --> 01:04:55,771
Okay, kids. You can get your things
ready. Be ready to get off the bus.

1235
01:04:55,854 --> 01:04:58,357
I'm gonna get you to your
parents as quickly as we can.

1236
01:05:09,243 --> 01:05:12,079
[students clamoring]

1237
01:05:14,623 --> 01:05:16,167
-[student 1] Our parents...
-[student 2] The school's...

1238
01:05:16,250 --> 01:05:18,961
-[student 3] Oh, my God.
-[student 4] No! Where are they?

1239
01:05:21,797 --> 01:05:24,341
-[Kevin] No, no, no, no, no. No, no.
-[Mary] Where are they?

1240
01:05:26,093 --> 01:05:28,720
[students clamoring]

1241
01:05:29,805 --> 01:05:30,889
[Kevin] Oh, shit!

1242
01:05:31,974 --> 01:05:34,143
I want my mom. [cries]

1243
01:05:34,226 --> 01:05:36,061
I'll go see if anybody's there.

1244
01:05:46,697 --> 01:05:48,031
Hello!

1245
01:05:48,824 --> 01:05:50,242
Hello!

1246
01:05:52,911 --> 01:05:53,912
[Kevin grunts]

1247
01:05:54,496 --> 01:05:56,582
[Kevin coughing]

1248
01:06:02,254 --> 01:06:03,338
[pants]

1249
01:06:10,053 --> 01:06:11,639
[Mary] They're...
They're not here.

1250
01:06:11,722 --> 01:06:13,432
There's no one here.

1251
01:06:15,267 --> 01:06:18,687
I don't know why they
didn't warn us or...

1252
01:06:19,188 --> 01:06:20,272
What do we do?

1253
01:06:21,148 --> 01:06:22,149
I don't know.

1254
01:06:22,232 --> 01:06:23,483
What... [sighs]

1255
01:06:28,739 --> 01:06:31,283
We gotta get outta here. We
gotta get these kids out of here.

1256
01:06:31,366 --> 01:06:33,869
Try to get them down to the
main evac center in Chico.

1257
01:06:36,205 --> 01:06:38,207
And then we can come
back for our kids.

1258
01:06:38,290 --> 01:06:39,667
[student] Miss Mary!

1259
01:06:39,750 --> 01:06:41,668
I'm coming. I'm coming.

1260
01:06:43,378 --> 01:06:44,379
[exhales sharply]

1261
01:06:50,302 --> 01:06:51,386
Sit down.

1262
01:06:51,887 --> 01:06:53,764
-[student 2] Ava needs you.
-What's wrong with Ava?

1263
01:06:53,847 --> 01:06:55,433
[student 2] She won't
come from under her seat.

1264
01:06:55,516 --> 01:06:57,143
-What? She's on the floor?
-Yeah, she needs you.

1265
01:06:57,226 --> 01:06:59,146
-Why? What's wrong with her?
-She won't get up!

1266
01:06:59,478 --> 01:07:02,064
-She's scared.
-[Mary] Ava. Honey, no.

1267
01:07:02,147 --> 01:07:03,315
[Ava sniffles]

1268
01:07:03,398 --> 01:07:05,317
[stammers] What are
you doing down there?

1269
01:07:05,400 --> 01:07:06,819
[Ava breathing shakily]

1270
01:07:06,902 --> 01:07:08,696
-Are you okay?
-[whimpers]

1271
01:07:08,779 --> 01:07:09,863
No?

1272
01:07:10,822 --> 01:07:13,367
-It's all a little bit scary.
-[Kevin] Okay.

1273
01:07:13,450 --> 01:07:15,327
-Mary, are we good?
-[Mary] Yeah. Good to go.

1274
01:07:15,410 --> 01:07:16,495
Okay.

1275
01:07:25,087 --> 01:07:26,130
Are you scared?

1276
01:07:26,213 --> 01:07:28,257
-Yeah. [sniffles]
-[Mary] Yeah.

1277
01:07:28,340 --> 01:07:29,508
I know.

1278
01:07:30,092 --> 01:07:31,510
I'm scared too.

1279
01:07:32,094 --> 01:07:33,220
Can I give you a hug?

1280
01:07:34,638 --> 01:07:36,139
[Ava] Mm-hmm. [sniffles]

1281
01:07:38,642 --> 01:07:40,394
[Mary] There you go. Come on.

1282
01:07:51,113 --> 01:07:52,614
Be as brave as you can be.

1283
01:07:53,615 --> 01:07:56,118
[chattering on radio]

1284
01:07:56,201 --> 01:07:58,120
[firefighters yelling]

1285
01:07:58,203 --> 01:07:59,830
[siren wailing]

1286
01:07:59,913 --> 01:08:03,417
Chief, you've got 27,000
people in Paradise,

1287
01:08:03,500 --> 01:08:04,710
12,000 in Magalia.

1288
01:08:04,793 --> 01:08:06,796
You've got maybe 8,000
people evacuated,

1289
01:08:06,879 --> 01:08:10,091
which means you've got 30,000 people
left in the footprint of the fire.

1290
01:08:10,174 --> 01:08:11,383
Finney, come here a second.

1291
01:08:11,466 --> 01:08:13,219
Update on the infrastructure.
How we doing with that?

1292
01:08:13,302 --> 01:08:16,012
So, infrastructure, Chief, we got
multiple schools in the town here.

1293
01:08:16,095 --> 01:08:19,057
We have two that are being impacted
immediately along-along Pentz road.

1294
01:08:19,140 --> 01:08:22,812
I also have a report that a school
bus came out of Ponderosa Elementary

1295
01:08:22,895 --> 01:08:25,396
with 22 kids on it. It's
unaccounted for right now, but...

1296
01:08:25,479 --> 01:08:26,856
Keep me updated on that.

1297
01:08:26,939 --> 01:08:28,358
We also have multiple
gas stations.

1298
01:08:28,942 --> 01:08:30,111
We have two propane facilities.

1299
01:08:30,194 --> 01:08:33,155
One in Skyway in between Pentz and
Clark and another one in Magalia.

1300
01:08:33,238 --> 01:08:35,533
-Can you shut them down?
-I'll work on it.

1301
01:08:35,616 --> 01:08:37,952
[firefighter] Part of the evacuation
problem, power lines are coming down.

1302
01:08:38,035 --> 01:08:39,620
They cannot get across the road.

1303
01:08:39,703 --> 01:08:42,498
Firefighters are cutting them right now to
open it up, but we're getting reports...

1304
01:08:42,581 --> 01:08:43,791
Where's PG&E?

1305
01:08:43,874 --> 01:08:45,751
[firefighter] We're getting
reports of active power lines.

1306
01:08:45,834 --> 01:08:47,034
-[firefighter 2] PG&E.
-Yeah.

1307
01:08:47,669 --> 01:08:49,088
-[chief] I thought the power was off.
-It is.

1308
01:08:49,171 --> 01:08:50,172
Tell them what's going on.

1309
01:08:50,255 --> 01:08:51,507
Why is your power on?

1310
01:08:51,590 --> 01:08:53,133
It's... Look, we're
working on it.

1311
01:08:53,216 --> 01:08:54,968
[firefighter] We got civilians
driving across power lines.

1312
01:08:55,051 --> 01:08:56,512
-We got firefighters cutting lines...
-I understand.

1313
01:08:56,595 --> 01:08:57,847
-I understand.
-...and lines are still arcing?

1314
01:08:57,930 --> 01:09:00,391
-You told me the power was off.
-Look. All the automatic power is off.

1315
01:09:00,474 --> 01:09:02,226
Thereafter it's manual
switches that have to be done.

1316
01:09:02,309 --> 01:09:03,852
-We're working as fast as we can.
-I don't give a shit.

1317
01:09:03,935 --> 01:09:05,521
-I understand.
-Do you know what's going on here?

1318
01:09:05,604 --> 01:09:07,398
Shut the fucking power off!

1319
01:09:07,481 --> 01:09:08,941
-Okay.
-What the fuck is wrong with you?

1320
01:09:09,024 --> 01:09:12,570
I've got firefighters in there!
There's 30,000 people in there!

1321
01:09:12,653 --> 01:09:14,738
[horns honking]

1322
01:09:17,491 --> 01:09:19,493
[horns honking]

1323
01:09:21,995 --> 01:09:23,580
[Mary] What the hell
are we gonna do?

1324
01:09:23,663 --> 01:09:25,207
[Kevin] The fire's behind us.

1325
01:09:25,290 --> 01:09:27,918
We gotta stay ahead of it
and stay due southwest.

1326
01:09:28,001 --> 01:09:29,462
That clear patch of
sky, that's our way out.

1327
01:09:29,545 --> 01:09:31,797
We stay out of the fire, and we
head down to Chico from there.

1328
01:09:31,880 --> 01:09:34,467
Um, Pentz and-and Clark are out,

1329
01:09:34,550 --> 01:09:36,927
-so that leaves Neal and Skyway.
-Yeah. Yeah.

1330
01:09:37,010 --> 01:09:38,137
[Kevin] Yeah.

1331
01:09:38,220 --> 01:09:40,097
[Mary] Neal is the furthest
away, but maybe that's good.

1332
01:09:40,180 --> 01:09:41,265
Maybe there's less
traffic there.

1333
01:09:41,348 --> 01:09:43,726
[Kevin] But you have to take
Roe Road to get to Neal.

1334
01:09:43,809 --> 01:09:46,687
It's-It's narrow, and it's
full of 180 degree turns.

1335
01:09:46,770 --> 01:09:49,106
It's-it's not built
for a 35,000 pound bus.

1336
01:09:49,189 --> 01:09:50,649
We'd be trapped down
there. There's no way out.

1337
01:09:50,732 --> 01:09:53,276
-That really just leaves us Skyway.
-Skyway. Right.

1338
01:09:53,359 --> 01:09:56,280
-It's-It's wide, four lanes, straight.
-Yeah.

1339
01:09:58,448 --> 01:10:00,618
-Let's try Skyway. Okay.
-Skyway.

1340
01:10:00,701 --> 01:10:03,662
You don't know where
they are, do you?

1341
01:10:04,246 --> 01:10:05,164
[Mary] What, honey?

1342
01:10:05,247 --> 01:10:06,582
Our parents.

1343
01:10:07,082 --> 01:10:08,500
You don't know where they are.

1344
01:10:10,419 --> 01:10:12,922
No, honey, we don't, but
we're gonna find them.

1345
01:10:13,005 --> 01:10:14,590
We're gonna find their
parents, right, Kevin?

1346
01:10:14,673 --> 01:10:16,550
Yeah. Yeah, we're
gonna find them. Yeah.

1347
01:10:16,633 --> 01:10:18,552
I need you to take
your seat, sweetie.

1348
01:10:20,095 --> 01:10:22,639
You wanna sit down up here?

1349
01:10:24,057 --> 01:10:25,935
-Have a seat.
-[Mary] Here.

1350
01:10:26,018 --> 01:10:27,227
Yeah, this is fine.

1351
01:10:30,105 --> 01:10:31,315
What's your name?

1352
01:10:31,398 --> 01:10:32,482
Toby.

1353
01:10:34,318 --> 01:10:35,402
Your parents work out of town?

1354
01:10:35,485 --> 01:10:36,904
My mom does.

1355
01:10:38,488 --> 01:10:39,823
I don't see my dad.

1356
01:10:43,744 --> 01:10:47,206
I'll tell you what, Toby. We're
gonna get you back to your mom.

1357
01:10:47,289 --> 01:10:49,458
You hear me? We're gonna
get you back to your mom.

1358
01:10:49,541 --> 01:10:52,628
We're gonna get you back to your son,
and we're gonna get me back to mine.

1359
01:10:53,212 --> 01:10:54,412
That's what's going to happen.

1360
01:10:55,088 --> 01:10:56,131
Okay?

1361
01:10:58,634 --> 01:10:59,385
Okay.

1362
01:10:59,468 --> 01:11:02,388
[firefighter] So, Chief, the fire is
spreading through most of Paradise,

1363
01:11:02,471 --> 01:11:04,723
both business and
residential areas,

1364
01:11:04,806 --> 01:11:07,435
and we're getting reports of
significant structure loss,

1365
01:11:07,518 --> 01:11:09,353
and Air Attack is still
grounded with no ETA.

1366
01:11:09,436 --> 01:11:10,438
-Copy that.
-Hey, Chief.

1367
01:11:10,521 --> 01:11:12,106
I've-I've checked
in with division.

1368
01:11:12,189 --> 01:11:15,860
Last report of that bus was coming
down Clark Road south of Elliott. Okay?

1369
01:11:15,943 --> 01:11:17,361
I just got word
from Division Hotel

1370
01:11:17,444 --> 01:11:19,363
that Paradise Elementary
is well involved in fire.

1371
01:11:19,446 --> 01:11:20,572
They're not there.

1372
01:11:40,050 --> 01:11:41,610
[Kevin] Mary, can
you see these cables?

1373
01:11:42,219 --> 01:11:43,303
-Yeah.
-[Kevin] All right.

1374
01:11:45,973 --> 01:11:47,641
[explosions]

1375
01:11:47,724 --> 01:11:49,935
-[Mary] Oh, my God. Watch out.
-[students screaming]

1376
01:11:50,018 --> 01:11:51,395
Got it. Got it. Got it.

1377
01:11:51,895 --> 01:11:53,355
[horn honks]

1378
01:11:54,189 --> 01:11:55,357
[horn honks]

1379
01:11:57,109 --> 01:11:58,909
-[yells]
-[Mary] Kevin, on the right! Kevin!

1380
01:12:01,822 --> 01:12:03,031
Power line on the right!

1381
01:12:04,074 --> 01:12:04,992
[people screaming]

1382
01:12:05,075 --> 01:12:07,161
[students screaming]

1383
01:12:07,244 --> 01:12:10,038
-[Kevin] The whole road's coming down.
-Oh, my God. [pants]

1384
01:12:13,792 --> 01:12:15,377
It's falling! It's falling!

1385
01:12:16,753 --> 01:12:18,255
Watch out! Watch out!

1386
01:12:19,339 --> 01:12:20,883
-[screams]
-Oh, my God.

1387
01:12:22,384 --> 01:12:23,552
[students screaming]

1388
01:12:24,428 --> 01:12:25,679
[Kevin] Going left!

1389
01:12:29,224 --> 01:12:31,059
It's gonna cut
through to Skyway.

1390
01:12:31,560 --> 01:12:32,853
We can make it.
It's just down here.

1391
01:12:32,936 --> 01:12:35,564
[Mary] Kids, hold on!
Hold onto something!

1392
01:12:41,820 --> 01:12:43,071
-Hang on!
-Oh, my God.

1393
01:12:49,995 --> 01:12:51,163
[Kevin] Shit!

1394
01:12:53,081 --> 01:12:56,502
[sirens wailing]

1395
01:12:58,587 --> 01:12:59,547
[firefighter 1
speaks indistinctly]

1396
01:12:59,630 --> 01:13:02,383
[firefighter 2] Keep it in
check! Back it up! Come on back!

1397
01:13:02,466 --> 01:13:04,009
[clamoring]

1398
01:13:05,636 --> 01:13:08,347
[inhales sharply] We're blocked.
We're totally blocked in.

1399
01:13:13,977 --> 01:13:19,108
We gotta get off, find a way to Roe,
and try to make a way out on Neal.

1400
01:13:19,191 --> 01:13:21,193
It's our only chance right now.

1401
01:13:22,152 --> 01:13:23,904
-How are we gonna get out of here?
-Look for a way off. Left or right.

1402
01:13:23,987 --> 01:13:25,280
I'm looking. I'm looking.

1403
01:13:26,949 --> 01:13:29,326
I don't see anything. There's no way
out. I don't see... It's everywhere.

1404
01:13:29,409 --> 01:13:32,037
It's all around us. How are
we gonna get out of here?

1405
01:13:33,205 --> 01:13:34,206
Oh, my God!

1406
01:13:34,289 --> 01:13:36,167
[screaming]

1407
01:13:36,250 --> 01:13:37,543
Look straight ahead.

1408
01:13:37,626 --> 01:13:39,587
-Don't look at that.
-[Kevin] Straight ahead!

1409
01:13:39,670 --> 01:13:41,756
Get out the fucking car!

1410
01:13:41,839 --> 01:13:43,966
[clamoring]

1411
01:13:44,049 --> 01:13:45,634
Kevin, there's looters.

1412
01:13:46,134 --> 01:13:48,095
-Open up. Let me in!
-Get off the windows!

1413
01:13:48,178 --> 01:13:49,221
Stay away from the windows!

1414
01:13:49,304 --> 01:13:51,640
-Down! Get down!
-[Kevin] Stay away from the windows!

1415
01:13:52,766 --> 01:13:54,435
[grunts] Give us the bus!

1416
01:13:54,518 --> 01:13:55,770
[grunts]

1417
01:13:55,853 --> 01:13:57,938
-Mary!
-[looter grunts] Open it!

1418
01:13:58,021 --> 01:14:00,232
He has a gun!
Kevin, he has a gun!

1419
01:14:00,315 --> 01:14:01,859
[looter] Open it!

1420
01:14:01,942 --> 01:14:04,153
-[grunts]
-Down! Duck. I said duck.

1421
01:14:04,236 --> 01:14:06,238
Open the door! [grunts]

1422
01:14:06,321 --> 01:14:08,783
-[Mary] We have to get out of here.
-[looter grunts]

1423
01:14:08,866 --> 01:14:10,075
We have to get out of here.

1424
01:14:10,158 --> 01:14:12,661
On the left. On the left,
Kevin, there's a gap.

1425
01:14:12,744 --> 01:14:14,371
Kevin, there's a gap. Go left.

1426
01:14:15,414 --> 01:14:16,874
Left. Go, go, go, go.

1427
01:14:19,418 --> 01:14:20,878
It's closing. It's closing.

1428
01:14:23,589 --> 01:14:25,341
[Kevin] We're through.
We're through.

1429
01:14:25,424 --> 01:14:26,467
[sighs]

01:14:26,550 --> 01:14:28,635
-[sirens wailing]
-[clamoring]

1431
01:14:29,761 --> 01:14:31,138
[officer] Stay with
your family, please.

1432
01:14:31,221 --> 01:14:34,308
This is the safe area, sir.
We need you to stay here...

1433
01:14:35,392 --> 01:14:37,520
-Let's go. Let's go.
-[person] That's my daughter.

1434
01:14:37,603 --> 01:14:39,480
-[firefighter 1] Out of the way.
-[firefighter 2] Watch your back.

1435
01:14:39,563 --> 01:14:41,148
-Go!
-Move!

1436
01:14:42,524 --> 01:14:44,764
[Ruby] Just keep going. Just
keep going. Just keep going.

1437
01:14:45,360 --> 01:14:46,445
Whoa, whoa. Hold on.

1438
01:14:46,528 --> 01:14:48,697
[Ruby] I'm with the, uh,
Paradise Unified School District.

1439
01:14:48,780 --> 01:14:50,074
-Where are you from?
-Straight up.

1440
01:14:50,157 --> 01:14:51,408
[Ruby] Thank you. That's
where the busses are.

1441
01:14:51,491 --> 01:14:53,076
Okay. Thank you.
Just keep going.

1442
01:14:55,579 --> 01:14:57,540
This is the... Yeah, there
they are. There they are.

1443
01:14:57,623 --> 01:14:59,023
Let me out. Let me
out. Let me out.

1444
01:15:01,543 --> 01:15:03,003
-Cesar?
-[Cesar] Ruby.

1445
01:15:03,086 --> 01:15:05,255
Cesar. You heard any news?

1446
01:15:05,964 --> 01:15:07,925
-Nothing.
-963's not here?

1447
01:15:08,008 --> 01:15:09,343
[Cesar] Hasn't made it back yet.

1448
01:15:09,927 --> 01:15:11,345
Shit. [sighs]

1449
01:15:12,554 --> 01:15:14,140
[colleague] Ruby,
the parents are here.

1450
01:15:14,223 --> 01:15:17,184
Okay. Okay. Okay.

1451
01:15:20,646 --> 01:15:22,481
[students sobbing]

1452
01:15:22,564 --> 01:15:25,317
[Kevin] 963 to Base. 963
to Base. Do you read?

1453
01:15:25,400 --> 01:15:27,486
[static on radio]

1454
01:15:28,320 --> 01:15:31,115
-Miss Mary, I don't have any water left.
-963 to all vehicles.

1455
01:15:31,198 --> 01:15:33,868
-Do you read? Any vehicles, do you read?
-I'm thirsty. I'm way too hot.

1456
01:15:33,951 --> 01:15:35,411
Okay. Okay.

1457
01:15:35,494 --> 01:15:36,912
[sighs] Here, honey.

1458
01:15:37,454 --> 01:15:39,415
Get a folder or a... a
notebook or something...

1459
01:15:39,498 --> 01:15:41,625
Hey, listen, we just got
off Skyway. It was a no-go.

1460
01:15:41,708 --> 01:15:42,752
Here. Use it like this.

1461
01:15:42,835 --> 01:15:45,504
We're gonna try and-and-and
make our way out through Neal.

1462
01:15:45,587 --> 01:15:48,174
Stay out of the fire. Get out
that way. It's our only shot.

1463
01:15:48,257 --> 01:15:50,217
Miss Mary, we really
need some water.

1464
01:15:50,300 --> 01:15:52,180
Hang in there, sweetie.
I know. It's really hot.

1465
01:15:54,054 --> 01:15:56,056
Kevin, the kids
are not gonna last.

1466
01:15:56,139 --> 01:15:58,642
They need water. They're
hot, and they're thirsty.

1467
01:16:02,604 --> 01:16:04,523
[students screaming]

1468
01:16:04,606 --> 01:16:06,926
-[student 1] What's happening?
-[student 2] What is that?

1469
01:16:07,401 --> 01:16:08,694
[Mary] What the hell is that?

1470
01:16:09,945 --> 01:16:12,656
[student 3] I can't breathe.
It's coming through the vents.

1471
01:16:12,739 --> 01:16:14,241
[students coughing]

1472
01:16:14,324 --> 01:16:17,202
The smoke. The smoke is getting
in. Kevin, the smoke is coming in.

1473
01:16:17,786 --> 01:16:19,121
It's coming through the AC.

1474
01:16:19,955 --> 01:16:21,123
[Mary] Then turn it off.

1475
01:16:21,206 --> 01:16:22,666
It's gonna make the
heat worse, but okay.

1476
01:16:22,749 --> 01:16:24,043
We have to try something.

1477
01:16:24,126 --> 01:16:25,377
[AC powering down]

1478
01:16:25,460 --> 01:16:26,962
[Kevin] Okay, it's off. Off.

1479
01:16:32,551 --> 01:16:34,595
We must be inside
the smoke column.

1480
01:16:34,678 --> 01:16:37,181
-[pants] Watch out.
-Yeah. Yeah. I see it. I see it.

1481
01:16:40,267 --> 01:16:41,307
[Kevin] Meadow Creek Park.

1482
01:16:42,769 --> 01:16:44,688
Yeah. Yeah. There's...
There's a back exit.

1483
01:16:45,397 --> 01:16:46,398
[Mary] What?

1484
01:16:46,481 --> 01:16:48,525
I worked here one
summer as a kid.

1485
01:16:49,568 --> 01:16:51,112
It leads out to Roe Road,

1486
01:16:51,195 --> 01:16:54,448
and then we can get over to
Neal, and then we're out. Okay?

1487
01:16:54,531 --> 01:16:56,158
-[Mary] Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.
-Yes.

1488
01:16:59,244 --> 01:17:01,246
Miss. Ma'am.

1489
01:17:01,872 --> 01:17:03,916
-Yeah?
-There's something wrong with Shannon.

1490
01:17:03,999 --> 01:17:05,960
-She needs your help.
-She's wheezing a little bit.

1491
01:17:06,043 --> 01:17:07,920
-[Shannon wheezing]
-[Mary] What's wrong, honey?

1492
01:17:08,003 --> 01:17:10,005
-Okay. Okay. Don't talk. Don't talk.
-[breathing heavily]

1493
01:17:10,088 --> 01:17:13,050
Just breathe slowly, okay? Slowly.
Try to slow down your breathing.

1494
01:17:13,675 --> 01:17:15,344
Okay. You just need
to drink some water.

1495
01:17:15,427 --> 01:17:18,597
Um, can everybody just
look in their backpack

1496
01:17:18,680 --> 01:17:22,351
and make sure you don't have,
like, a juice box or something?

1497
01:17:24,269 --> 01:17:27,356
Kevin, we... we have to find
water or she's gonna stroke out.

1498
01:17:27,940 --> 01:17:29,691
We have to get off the bus now.

1499
01:17:32,611 --> 01:17:33,988
-Right there. Right there.
-Yep, yep.

1500
01:17:34,071 --> 01:17:35,781
-[Mary] Yes. Yes. Okay.
-Yep, yep.

1501
01:17:35,864 --> 01:17:38,534
[Kevin] Okay. We can't stop
for long. I'll be two minutes.

1502
01:17:38,617 --> 01:17:39,910
[Mary] No, no, no, no, no, no.

1503
01:17:39,993 --> 01:17:41,495
You need to stay on the bus.

1504
01:17:41,578 --> 01:17:43,664
If the fire comes, you
have to drive them.

1505
01:17:44,331 --> 01:17:47,084
Let me go. I can do it. Two
minutes. I'll be right back.

1506
01:17:47,626 --> 01:17:48,669
I can do it.

1507
01:17:49,169 --> 01:17:50,295
I can do it.

1508
01:17:51,380 --> 01:17:52,840
[student] Miss Mary,
where are you going?

1509
01:17:52,923 --> 01:17:55,008
[student 2] Miss Mary.
Miss Mary, come back.

1510
01:17:57,970 --> 01:17:59,805
[grunts, coughs]

1511
01:18:01,807 --> 01:18:04,351
-[students crying]
-[student 3] Where did Mary go?

1512
01:18:12,067 --> 01:18:13,110
Shit.

1513
01:18:14,444 --> 01:18:15,445
[grunts]

1514
01:18:16,321 --> 01:18:18,449
[chiming]

1515
01:18:18,532 --> 01:18:20,451
[student 4] Do you know
where Miss Mary is?

1516
01:18:20,534 --> 01:18:22,328
[Kevin] She... She just
went to look for some water.

1517
01:18:22,411 --> 01:18:23,996
Just-Just give her a minute.

1518
01:18:24,079 --> 01:18:25,539
[student 1] Please
come back, Miss Mary.

1519
01:18:25,622 --> 01:18:26,874
[student 2] Where is she going?

1520
01:18:27,499 --> 01:18:29,210
[student 3] I can't see her.

1521
01:18:29,293 --> 01:18:30,544
[coughing]

1522
01:18:36,300 --> 01:18:37,384
[Mary coughs]

1523
01:18:42,264 --> 01:18:43,515
[Mary] Come on.

1524
01:18:44,057 --> 01:18:45,142
Come on.

1525
01:18:45,225 --> 01:18:46,685
[grunting]

1526
01:18:46,768 --> 01:18:48,312
[student] Come back.

1527
01:18:48,395 --> 01:18:50,856

01:18:57,863 --> 01:19:00,866
[horn honking]

1529
01:19:13,045 --> 01:19:14,130
[honking continues]

1530
01:19:14,213 --> 01:19:15,297
[Mary] Yes. Yes.

1531
01:19:17,716 --> 01:19:19,635
[grunts, pants] Got it.

1532
01:19:19,718 --> 01:19:21,803
Oh, my God. Got it.

1533
01:19:27,226 --> 01:19:28,269

[students clamoring]

1535
01:19:30,854 --> 01:19:32,857
Mary!

1536
01:19:32,940 --> 01:19:35,275
[Mary panting, groaning]

1537
01:19:51,208 --> 01:19:52,334
[students scream]

1538
01:19:54,253 --> 01:19:55,462
Mary!

1539
01:19:56,129 --> 01:19:58,131
[crying]

1540
01:20:00,217 --> 01:20:01,426
Mary!

1541
01:20:03,804 --> 01:20:05,681
-Mary!
-[student 1] What do we do now?

1542
01:20:05,764 --> 01:20:07,683
-[explosion]
-[screams]

1543
01:20:12,771 --> 01:20:14,940
-Mary!
-[Mary panting] I'm coming!

1544
01:20:15,566 --> 01:20:18,193
I'm coming! [panting]

1545
01:20:18,777 --> 01:20:20,279
-Go, go, go, go.
-[Mary] Help me. Help me.

1546
01:20:20,362 --> 01:20:22,030
Get the water. Get the water.

1547
01:20:24,575 --> 01:20:25,576
[student 2] Miss Mary's here.

1548
01:20:25,659 --> 01:20:27,453
[panting]

1549
01:20:27,536 --> 01:20:29,288
[door creaks, closes]

1550
01:20:34,126 --> 01:20:35,711
-[Mary] Okay.
-You okay?

1551
01:20:35,794 --> 01:20:38,255
I'm okay. I'm okay. I'm okay.

1552
01:20:38,338 --> 01:20:41,049
-[engine revving]
-[students screaming]

1553
01:20:44,052 --> 01:20:45,137

01:20:45,721 --> 01:20:46,805
[exhales deeply]

1555
01:20:47,472 --> 01:20:49,725
Can somebody get this
water to Shannon?

1556
01:20:53,103 --> 01:20:54,605
-[yells]
-Oh, my God!

1557

[grunts]

1558
01:21:00,944 --> 01:21:03,071
[Mary] Duck! Down!
Cover your heads!

1559

-[yells]
-[students scream]

1560
01:21:11,830 --> 01:21:13,498
-Shit!
-[Mary] Oh, my God!

1561
01:21:14,791 --> 01:21:16,084
[groans]

1562
01:21:17,753 --> 01:21:20,172
Everybody, hold on! Stay
away from the windows.

1563
01:21:20,255 --> 01:21:21,840
Everyone, hold on!

1564
01:21:22,508 --> 01:21:25,719
Oh, my God. We gotta go
right. That's the way out.

1565
01:21:31,892 --> 01:21:33,977
-[screams]
-[Mary] Oh, my God!

1566
01:21:38,440 --> 01:21:39,440
[Kevin] Hold on!

1567
01:21:42,402 --> 01:21:45,531
Okay. Stay down. Stay down.

1568
01:21:47,699 --> 01:21:49,243
On the right. On the
right. On the right.

1569
01:21:49,326 --> 01:21:51,912
-That burnt building on the right.
-[screams]

1570
01:21:53,664 --> 01:21:55,666
This is the way out.
[pants] That's it.

1571
01:21:56,416 --> 01:21:59,169
Here it is. This is the
exit. This takes us to Roe.

1572
01:22:06,093 --> 01:22:08,303
[Ruby] Hello, everyone.
If I could get y'all in.

1573
01:22:09,429 --> 01:22:11,098
Uh, my name is Ruby Bishop.

1574
01:22:11,765 --> 01:22:13,517
I am the school's director
of transportation,

1575
01:22:13,600 --> 01:22:15,435
and I just wanna
give you an update.

1576
01:22:16,019 --> 01:22:17,354
I know y'all are worried,

1577
01:22:17,437 --> 01:22:20,900
but I want you to know first and foremost
that your children were evacuated

1578
01:22:20,983 --> 01:22:24,236
from Ponderosa Elementary
earlier this morning. Okay?

1579
01:22:24,319 --> 01:22:25,696
[parent] When will we know more?

1580
01:22:26,238 --> 01:22:30,075
Unfortunately, shortly
after leaving the school,

1581
01:22:30,158 --> 01:22:32,328
the fire destroyed our
radio communication.

1582
01:22:32,411 --> 01:22:36,707
So we have not had contact with
the bus since it left Ponderosa.

1583
01:22:36,790 --> 01:22:37,833
Wait, you don't
know where they are?

1584
01:22:37,916 --> 01:22:41,670
[Ruby] All I know is that they're
probably somewhere over in East Paradise.

1585
01:22:41,753 --> 01:22:43,422
[parent 2] East
Paradise is on fire!

1586
01:22:43,505 --> 01:22:48,135
I know, but I want you to know
that both police and fire command

1587
01:22:48,218 --> 01:22:50,805
are looking for them
out there, okay?

1588
01:22:50,888 --> 01:22:52,807
They're doing their best,

1589
01:22:52,890 --> 01:22:56,519
but you must know that your
children are on the bus

1590
01:22:56,602 --> 01:22:59,355
with a driver and a
teacher named Mary Ludwig.

1591
01:22:59,438 --> 01:23:01,690
-Some of you may know Mrs. Ludwig?
-[parents murmuring]

1592
01:23:01,773 --> 01:23:03,442
-Okay.
-Which... Which driver is it?

1593
01:23:03,525 --> 01:23:06,278
Yes. His-His name is Kevin McKay.
He's a new driver to our district.

1594
01:23:06,361 --> 01:23:08,280
-[parents 3] New driver?
-[Ruby] Listen...

1595
01:23:09,239 --> 01:23:11,117
-Everybody, please.
-[parents clamoring]

1596
01:23:11,200 --> 01:23:12,201
Please. I know.

1597
01:23:12,284 --> 01:23:14,245
I know this is really
difficult news.

1598
01:23:14,328 --> 01:23:15,913
-He's a good driver.
-[Ruby] Kevin McKay.

1599
01:23:15,996 --> 01:23:20,000
I can vouch for Kevin McKay,
as can all of my drivers.

1600
01:23:20,083 --> 01:23:23,253
He is a good man, and he is
gonna do everything he can.

1601
01:23:24,129 --> 01:23:25,423
You have to trust him.

1602
01:23:25,506 --> 01:23:30,552
I trust him, and right now he is
all we have got out there. Okay?

1603
01:23:36,266 --> 01:23:39,186
[electricity crackling]

1604
01:23:39,269 --> 01:23:41,355
[Kevin] This is it.
[panting] This is Roe Road.

1605
01:23:42,439 --> 01:23:43,524
Fire's behind us.

1606
01:23:44,650 --> 01:23:48,278
Okay, a couple of miles on this
should get us out towards Neal.

1607
01:23:49,071 --> 01:23:50,072
Okay.

1608
01:23:51,240 --> 01:23:52,241
[Mary] Okay.

1609
01:23:56,662 --> 01:23:58,455
Rocks on the right.
Rocks on the right.

1610
01:24:04,002 --> 01:24:05,087
Watch your left.

1611
01:24:09,007 --> 01:24:11,802
-There's a drop-off.
-[student 1] I'm scared.

1612
01:24:11,885 --> 01:24:13,470
[Mary] We're gonna
be okay, guys.

1613
01:24:13,971 --> 01:24:16,807
You don't need to worry. We're
gonna get through this, okay?

1614
01:24:21,687 --> 01:24:22,855
[student 2] Watch out.

1615
01:24:23,939 --> 01:24:24,940
[Kevin] Mary.

1616
01:24:26,483 --> 01:24:28,152
[stammers] What do
I have over there?

1617
01:24:28,235 --> 01:24:29,403
[stammers] Four feet?

1618
01:24:29,486 --> 01:24:31,989
[Mary] Two. [sighs]
Maybe two and a half.

1619
01:24:34,533 --> 01:24:35,785
[pants]

1620
01:24:35,868 --> 01:24:38,287
[firefighter] <i>Chief, our
fire in Butte Creek Canyon</i>

1621
01:24:38,370 --> 01:24:40,873
<i>and our fire in the west
branch have merged in Paradise.</i>

1622
01:24:40,956 --> 01:24:42,625
It's burning aligned
with the wind,

1623
01:24:42,708 --> 01:24:44,960
burning to the southwest
portion of Paradise.

1624
01:24:45,043 --> 01:24:47,296
The only area that
hasn't burned,

1625
01:24:47,379 --> 01:24:50,800
and the fire is heading in this
direction, is this area right here.

1626
01:24:50,883 --> 01:24:52,551
Foster Road. Roe Road.

1627
01:24:52,634 --> 01:24:54,428
Hey, these are tight roads.

1628
01:24:54,511 --> 01:24:56,639
A lot of structures in
there. It's all downhill.

1629
01:24:56,722 --> 01:24:59,558
You've got numerous spot fires
being reported down here already.

1630
01:24:59,641 --> 01:25:02,478
This area's gonna be fully
engulfed in fire very soon.

1631
01:25:02,561 --> 01:25:04,480
We have got zero resources
to put down here.

1632
01:25:04,563 --> 01:25:05,981
They're all engaged up here.

1633
01:25:06,064 --> 01:25:07,066
Whatever's down here,

1634
01:25:07,149 --> 01:25:09,777
they're gonna have to figure out for
themselves how to get out of Paradise.

1635
01:25:09,860 --> 01:25:12,279
We've got nothing to give
'em. Absolutely nothing.

1636

1637
01:25:28,170 --> 01:25:29,463
[student 1] Miss Mary.

1638
01:25:29,546 --> 01:25:31,226
[student 2] What are
they doing over there?

1639
01:25:32,090 --> 01:25:33,342

-[coughing]
-What are they doing?

1641
01:25:38,639 --> 01:25:40,641
Why are they going
back towards the fire?

01:25:50,859 --> 01:25:52,319

01:25:57,866 --> 01:25:59,826
[Kevin] No, no, no, no.
Come around this side.

1645
01:26:00,702 --> 01:26:02,037
[stammers] Is there
a way out down there?

1646
01:26:02,120 --> 01:26:03,539
[person 2] That fire's
burning across the ridge.

1647
01:26:03,622 --> 01:26:05,541
-People are dying down there.
-We got out on foot.

1648
01:26:05,624 --> 01:26:08,586
Do not go that way. The trailer
park, everything is burning.

1649
01:26:08,669 --> 01:26:10,254
Everything. There's no way out.

1650
01:26:10,337 --> 01:26:12,840
-What the hell are we gonna do?
-I-I just need to get to Neal Road.

1651
01:26:12,923 --> 01:26:15,384
No, you can't go to
Neal Road. It's on fire.

1652
01:26:15,467 --> 01:26:18,136
You don't want these kids
to see what we just saw.

1653
01:26:19,096 --> 01:26:20,180
Trust me.

1654
01:26:20,764 --> 01:26:21,765
Do not go that way.

1655
01:26:22,474 --> 01:26:23,976
Hey, we're gonna
take our chances.

1656
01:26:24,059 --> 01:26:25,727
Shit. [sighs]

1657
01:26:26,228 --> 01:26:27,437
[person 3] Good luck.

1658
01:26:29,314 --> 01:26:30,357
[engine stops]

1659
01:26:30,440 --> 01:26:31,525
What do we do?

1660
01:26:31,608 --> 01:26:32,818
[student 1] Why have we stopped?

1661
01:26:32,901 --> 01:26:34,361
-[student 2] No, keep going.
-I wanna go home.

1662
01:26:34,444 --> 01:26:37,406
Okay. Everyone, we just need
to stay quiet and calm, please.

1663
01:26:37,489 --> 01:26:39,992
And Kevin and I, we'll,
uh, figure this out.

1664
01:26:40,075 --> 01:26:41,577
[student 3] We need
to keep moving.

1665
01:26:41,660 --> 01:26:44,371
Okay. I'm gonna go have a look.
Check this ridge and this ridge.

1666
01:26:44,955 --> 01:26:47,249
Get the kids ready in case we have
to take them off the bus, okay?

1667
01:26:47,332 --> 01:26:48,417
[Mary] Okay.

1668
01:26:49,793 --> 01:26:51,795
[student 4] Kevin, what
are you doing? Don't go.

1669
01:26:54,923 --> 01:26:56,801
-Okay. Okay.
-[students clamoring]

1670
01:26:56,884 --> 01:26:57,885
[panting]

1671
01:26:57,968 --> 01:27:00,137
[Mary] Okay. Kids, this is
what I need for us to do.

1672
01:27:00,220 --> 01:27:03,473
I need us to stay quiet.
I need us to stay calm.

1673
01:27:04,057 --> 01:27:07,228
Kevin is going to check if it's
okay for us to get off the bus.

1674
01:27:07,311 --> 01:27:08,479
-In the meantime...
-[coughs]

1675
01:27:08,562 --> 01:27:11,190
...I want you to grab your backpack
and make a line in the aisle.

1676
01:27:11,273 --> 01:27:14,902
Slowly, quietly, as
calmly as you can, please.

1677
01:27:14,985 --> 01:27:16,236
[sighs]

1678
01:27:19,031 --> 01:27:20,616
[panting]

1679
01:27:39,593 --> 01:27:40,594
[exhales deeply]

1680
01:27:43,931 --> 01:27:45,015
Come on.

1681
01:27:46,934 --> 01:27:48,936
[coughing]

1682
01:28:17,256 --> 01:28:20,134
[Mary] Okay. As soon as Kevin gets
back, we're gonna file off, okay?

1683
01:28:20,217 --> 01:28:21,218
[students] Yes, ma'am.

1684
01:28:21,301 --> 01:28:22,511
[Mary] We're gonna
stay really close.

1685
01:28:22,594 --> 01:28:25,681
You're gonna find someone's
hand to hold, okay?

1686
01:28:26,431 --> 01:28:27,850
Stay really, really close.

1687
01:28:28,600 --> 01:28:30,394
-[knocks on door]
-[student] Look. Kevin, he's back.

1688
01:28:30,477 --> 01:28:31,687
[Mary] There he is.

1689
01:28:32,396 --> 01:28:34,356
[Kevin pants] Get the
kids. Seat the kids.

1690
01:28:34,439 --> 01:28:35,691
-We're staying on the bus.
-Okay.

1691
01:28:35,774 --> 01:28:37,485
-Staying on the bus.
-Okay. Everybody, sit down.

1692
01:28:37,568 --> 01:28:39,695
-[student] Wait. Wait. What?
-Everybody, sit.

1693
01:28:39,778 --> 01:28:41,697
Miss Mary, I thought you
said we were gonna go.

1694
01:28:41,780 --> 01:28:44,116
I did, honey. But... [stammers]
...we're gonna stay on the bus.

1695
01:28:44,199 --> 01:28:45,618
Uh, Henry, you're...

1696
01:28:45,701 --> 01:28:48,871
Take a seat. We're gonna... Kevin
and I are gonna figure out what...

1697
01:28:48,954 --> 01:28:50,915
-What happened?
-We're surrounded.

1698
01:28:50,998 --> 01:28:53,083
-Oh, my God.
-There's nowhere to go.

1699
01:28:53,166 --> 01:28:57,338
What? No. No, no, no. That's
impossible. It's impossible.

1700
01:28:57,421 --> 01:28:59,590
-There's gotta be a way out. [stammers]
-Listen to me.

1701
01:28:59,673 --> 01:29:02,510
-We're here on Roe.
-Okay. Okay.

1702
01:29:02,593 --> 01:29:03,886
-[Kevin] This is Neal.
-Okay.

1703
01:29:03,969 --> 01:29:05,721
[Kevin] I saw it all
from the ridge, okay?

1704
01:29:05,804 --> 01:29:10,643
The fire's on all sides. It's
here, it's here, here and here.

1705
01:29:10,726 --> 01:29:13,312
-Oh, my God.
-We gotta st... We gotta stay here.

1706
01:29:13,395 --> 01:29:15,981
We gotta... We gotta
stay on the bus.

1707
01:29:16,481 --> 01:29:17,733
We're gonna stay on the bus.

1708
01:29:18,317 --> 01:29:19,276
No.

1709
01:29:19,359 --> 01:29:21,695
-[grunts] No. We...
-We're gonna stay on the bus.

1710
01:29:21,778 --> 01:29:24,490
No. We... No. No. No.
We could go out on foot.

1711
01:29:24,573 --> 01:29:25,866
Those other people,
they went out on foot.

1712
01:29:25,949 --> 01:29:27,618
-We could try on foot.
-No. No way.

1713
01:29:29,161 --> 01:29:31,622
They won't last two minutes
out there. There's no way.

1714
01:29:32,206 --> 01:29:34,250
They won't last... They
won't last two minutes.

1715
01:29:34,333 --> 01:29:36,419
[both panting]

1716
01:29:36,502 --> 01:29:37,586
Gotta stay.

1717
01:29:38,712 --> 01:29:40,881
What? What, we stay here?

1718
01:29:40,964 --> 01:29:42,049
We just...

1719
01:29:42,132 --> 01:29:46,303
What do you... [stammers] We're
just gonna wait? What do...

1720
01:29:46,386 --> 01:29:48,973
-Maybe... Maybe the fire doesn't...
-What if the fire comes, but we...

1721
01:29:49,056 --> 01:29:51,267
Maybe it does or maybe
it doesn't come, okay?

1722
01:29:51,350 --> 01:29:52,393
I d... I don't know.

1723
01:29:52,476 --> 01:29:55,145
All I do know is we are in the
one place where the fire is not.

1724
01:29:56,188 --> 01:29:58,774
And we're alive right now. And
we got a little bit of time.

1725
01:30:00,192 --> 01:30:01,193
Stay.

1726
01:30:01,944 --> 01:30:02,862
That's our only chance.

1727
01:30:02,945 --> 01:30:03,946
Are you sure?

1728
01:30:04,029 --> 01:30:05,113
Yes.

1729
01:30:12,079 --> 01:30:13,830
[whispers] But what
if the fire comes?

1730
01:30:14,456 --> 01:30:16,125
What if the fire comes, Kevin?

1731
01:30:16,208 --> 01:30:18,753
[panting]

1732
01:30:18,836 --> 01:30:19,962
Listen to me.

1733
01:30:21,880 --> 01:30:22,965
[stammers, sobs]

1734
01:30:23,048 --> 01:30:26,134
What do we do with the
kids if the fire comes?

1735
01:30:28,387 --> 01:30:29,680
We gotta stay on the bus.

1736
01:30:30,222 --> 01:30:31,849
Okay. [inhales shakily]

1737
01:30:31,932 --> 01:30:33,433
[whimpers]

1738
01:30:34,226 --> 01:30:35,644
-Okay?
-Okay. [sobs]

1739
01:30:37,521 --> 01:30:38,605
Okay.

1740
01:30:39,106 --> 01:30:41,191
We'll stay on the...
We'll stay on the bus.

1741
01:30:42,234 --> 01:30:43,485
We'll stay on the bus.

1742
01:30:45,153 --> 01:30:47,155
[crying]

1743
01:31:13,307 --> 01:31:14,975
[students coughing]

1744
01:31:19,146 --> 01:31:20,355
[inhales deeply]

1745
01:31:24,568 --> 01:31:25,986
[sighs]

1746
01:31:29,406 --> 01:31:31,617
[breathing heavily]

1747
01:31:31,700 --> 01:31:35,078
[Kevin] Mary, hey.
I need your help.

1748
01:31:35,996 --> 01:31:37,331
We gotta buy some time.

1749
01:31:38,707 --> 01:31:43,295
I'm gonna cut my shirt up
into small pieces. All right?

1750
01:31:46,131 --> 01:31:47,049
What are you doing?

1751
01:31:47,132 --> 01:31:50,344
I'm gonna make some
filters for their mouths.

1752
01:31:50,427 --> 01:31:53,139
Wet them with some water.
It can soothe their throats.

1753
01:31:53,222 --> 01:31:56,267
Let's move the kids to the back of the
bus away from the... the air vents.

1754
01:31:56,350 --> 01:31:58,936
I'm gonna tape as many
vents as I can, okay?

1755
01:31:59,019 --> 01:32:00,103
Okay.

1756
01:32:01,146 --> 01:32:03,190
Chief, the water
supply is failing.

1757
01:32:03,273 --> 01:32:05,359
We've got no pressure
in the hydrants.

1758
01:32:06,485 --> 01:32:07,694
We are losing this thing.

1759
01:32:11,532 --> 01:32:13,450
Can I talk to you over
here for a second?

1760
01:32:14,785 --> 01:32:16,162
[Mary] <i>So we're gonna
rest for a little bit,</i>

1761
01:32:16,245 --> 01:32:18,038
and I wanna move you
to the back of the bus

1762
01:32:18,121 --> 01:32:19,790
so that you're further
away from the smoke, okay?

1763
01:32:19,873 --> 01:32:20,708
[student] Okay, Miss Mary.

1764
01:32:20,791 --> 01:32:23,752
Honey, can we move to the
back of the bus, all right?

1765
01:32:24,253 --> 01:32:25,254
Come on, this way.

1766
01:32:27,840 --> 01:32:30,300
That should help to keep
some of the smoke out, okay?

1767
01:32:31,134 --> 01:32:34,638
So we're getting reports of people
burning to death in their cars.

1768
01:32:35,264 --> 01:32:38,267
And we've got hundreds of people
running for their lives on foot.

1769
01:32:38,767 --> 01:32:40,478
[students coughing]

1770
01:32:40,561 --> 01:32:43,188
[Mary] Okay, girls. We're gonna
be here for a little while.

1771
01:32:43,772 --> 01:32:46,525
I want you to take this filter,

1772
01:32:47,067 --> 01:32:49,904
put it over your mouth and
your nose and breathe, okay?

1773
01:32:49,987 --> 01:32:52,782
[firefighter] If we don't play this
right, we're gonna wake up in the morning

1774
01:32:52,865 --> 01:32:56,618
to hundreds or, I don't know,
even thousands of fatalities.

1775
01:32:57,411 --> 01:32:59,913
Okay? So at this point,
we can do one thing.

1776
01:33:00,497 --> 01:33:03,166
We can fight fire or save lives.

1777
01:33:03,667 --> 01:33:04,668
We are out of time.

1778
01:33:04,751 --> 01:33:07,713
I want you to put it over your
mouth and your nose and breathe.

1779
01:33:07,796 --> 01:33:09,965
-It's gonna help with the smoke, okay?
-Okay.

1780
01:33:10,048 --> 01:33:12,968
-[Mary] Yeah? How are you doing, sweetie?
-How long are we staying here?

1781
01:33:14,636 --> 01:33:16,388
[Mary] Thank you for taking
care of her, sweetie.

1782
01:33:16,471 --> 01:33:17,556
Mmm.

1783
01:33:18,557 --> 01:33:20,434
[Mary] Ava, I want you to
put this over your mouth.

1784
01:33:20,517 --> 01:33:21,768
[chief] <i>Okay, listen up.</i>

1785
01:33:23,896 --> 01:33:25,147
Cease all firefighting.

1786
01:33:25,981 --> 01:33:27,650
Get with your
resources inside town

1787
01:33:27,733 --> 01:33:29,693
and tell them to save
lives wherever they can.

1788
01:33:30,652 --> 01:33:31,778
That's all we can do now.

1789
01:33:32,279 --> 01:33:33,197
[firefighter] Copy that, Chief.

1790
01:33:33,280 --> 01:33:35,365
[firefighters chattering]

1791
01:33:40,370 --> 01:33:42,248
[person coughs] Hurry up.

1792
01:33:42,331 --> 01:33:43,582
[coughs]

1793
01:33:59,932 --> 01:34:01,934
[students coughing]

1794
01:34:09,525 --> 01:34:10,526
[sniffs]

1795
01:34:14,613 --> 01:34:15,656
[sighs]

1796
01:34:16,698 --> 01:34:18,450
The windows are so hot.

1797
01:34:22,579 --> 01:34:24,457
-I have to warn the kids.
-No, no, no. I can do it.

1798
01:34:24,540 --> 01:34:27,460
-No, no. I can... I'm good. I can do it.
-I... I know... I know you can.

1799
01:34:28,126 --> 01:34:29,754
Rest for a second.
I... I can do it.

1800
01:34:29,837 --> 01:34:31,505
Okay. Thank you.

1801
01:34:36,218 --> 01:34:37,219
[Kevin] Hey, guys.

1802
01:34:37,845 --> 01:34:40,181
The walls and the windows are really
hot, so... so don't touch them.

1803
01:34:40,264 --> 01:34:42,391
Okay? I want you to come...
lean towards the aisle.

1804
01:34:42,975 --> 01:34:45,352
Here we go. Can you come
this way a little bit?

1805
01:34:45,435 --> 01:34:47,104
The floor's really hot too.

1806
01:34:48,689 --> 01:34:50,148
Let's do the, um...

1807
01:34:51,233 --> 01:34:52,610
What do you do at story time?

1808
01:34:52,693 --> 01:34:56,280
Let's go crisscross?
Apple sauce?

1809
01:34:56,864 --> 01:34:57,782
Say it with me.

1810
01:34:57,865 --> 01:34:59,992
-[students] Crisscross apple sauce.
-Crisscross.

1811
01:35:00,075 --> 01:35:03,621
That's it, that's it. That's
it. Good. Good job, buddy. Okay.

1812
01:35:03,704 --> 01:35:04,872
[student] Is it nighttime?

1813
01:35:06,081 --> 01:35:07,082
What's that, sweetie?

1814
01:35:08,083 --> 01:35:09,460
Is it nighttime?

1815
01:35:09,543 --> 01:35:11,503
No, no, no. It's not nighttime.

1816
01:35:12,087 --> 01:35:15,132
It's just... It's smoke. It's in
between us and the sunshine. Okay?

1817
01:35:15,215 --> 01:35:17,843
Are we gonna be okay? [whimpers]

1818
01:35:17,926 --> 01:35:21,263
Yeah. [sighs] We are
gonna be... Yes, we are.

1819
01:35:21,346 --> 01:35:24,016
And that smoke's gonna go away,
and the sun's gonna come back out.

1820
01:35:24,099 --> 01:35:25,184
Okay?

1821
01:35:25,934 --> 01:35:28,270
Toby, you okay?

1822
01:35:28,353 --> 01:35:29,605
I want my daddy.

1823
01:35:36,528 --> 01:35:37,529
Yeah.

1824
01:35:39,865 --> 01:35:41,074
Yeah, I know you do.

1825
01:35:44,077 --> 01:35:46,496
He knows you do too. Okay?

1826
01:35:48,707 --> 01:35:49,958
Listen.

1827
01:35:51,126 --> 01:35:55,965
He's... He's doing everything
he can to get to you.

1828
01:35:56,048 --> 01:35:57,966
Okay? And he's trying his best.

1829
01:35:59,134 --> 01:36:01,553
-Okay? Toby, look at me.
-[sniffles]

1830
01:36:04,640 --> 01:36:05,641
Okay?

1831
01:36:08,685 --> 01:36:11,313
[breathing heavily]

1832
01:36:13,440 --> 01:36:15,025
[Kevin sighs]

1833
01:36:16,360 --> 01:36:18,028
How much time do we have?

1834
01:36:20,322 --> 01:36:21,823
Another hour maybe.

1835
01:36:22,950 --> 01:36:24,952
Those filters won't
last much longer.

1836
01:36:25,911 --> 01:36:28,914
Maybe we should just
let them go to sleep.

1837
01:36:32,459 --> 01:36:33,585
It's better.

1838
01:36:34,419 --> 01:36:36,172
[inhales shakily] Then
if the fire comes...

1839
01:36:36,255 --> 01:36:38,507
-[Kevin] No, no, no. No. No. No.
-[cries]

1840
01:36:39,174 --> 01:36:42,177
We can't... We can't let
ourselves talk like that. Okay?

1841
01:36:44,555 --> 01:36:45,556
Okay.

1842
01:36:46,056 --> 01:36:47,057
[inhales sharply]

1843
01:36:56,108 --> 01:36:58,110
[water running, splashing]

1844
01:37:09,246 --> 01:37:11,499
[chief] <i>Good afternoon.
I'm Chief Martinez.</i>

1845
01:37:11,582 --> 01:37:12,792
[reporters clamoring]

1846
01:37:12,875 --> 01:37:14,627
At approximately 6:30
a.m. this morning,

1847
01:37:14,710 --> 01:37:18,797
a fire was reported near the Pulga
Bridge, eight miles east of Paradise.

1848
01:37:20,757 --> 01:37:22,259
The fire spread rapidly,

1849
01:37:22,342 --> 01:37:24,762
overwhelming our best
efforts to contain it.

1850
01:37:24,845 --> 01:37:26,847
And at approximately
8:30 a.m. this morning,

1851
01:37:26,930 --> 01:37:29,933
the fire entered the
town of Paradise.

1852
01:37:31,143 --> 01:37:33,354
Unfortunately, moments ago, I
was forced to give the order

1853
01:37:33,437 --> 01:37:37,691
to cease firefighting in Paradise
and focus solely on protecting life.

1854
01:37:39,735 --> 01:37:42,863
Right now, there's still
thousands of residents trapped

1855
01:37:42,946 --> 01:37:44,781
or attempting to flee the fire.

1856
01:37:46,491 --> 01:37:51,830
And while we are doing everything
we humanly can to assist them...

1857
01:37:53,957 --> 01:37:55,375
despite our best efforts,

1858
01:37:56,168 --> 01:37:59,088
this community is facing the
full force of the fire alone.

1859
01:37:59,171 --> 01:38:00,931
-[reporters murmuring]
-[shutters clicking]

1860
01:38:05,093 --> 01:38:09,097
So we ask for your patience,

1861
01:38:10,766 --> 01:38:14,436
and I'll hand it over to Sheriff Thomas,
who may have more information for you.

1862
01:38:15,687 --> 01:38:17,356
We have to get back
to work. Thank you.

1863
01:38:17,439 --> 01:38:19,233
[reporters clamoring]

1864
01:38:19,316 --> 01:38:22,569
I just wanna add one thing.

1865
01:38:24,196 --> 01:38:26,115
Every year the fires get bigger.

1866
01:38:26,198 --> 01:38:27,699
And there's more of them.

1867
01:38:32,829 --> 01:38:35,416
We're being damn fools.
That's the truth. Thank you.

1868
01:38:35,499 --> 01:38:38,460
-[reporters clamoring]
-[shutters clicking]

1869
01:38:39,211 --> 01:38:41,296
[students coughing, wheezing]

1870
01:38:43,841 --> 01:38:46,009
This is gonna sound
silly to you...

1871
01:38:48,804 --> 01:38:53,642
but I've only ever
left Paradise one time.

1872
01:38:54,393 --> 01:38:55,477
Oh.

1873
01:38:56,603 --> 01:38:57,730
How's that?

1874
01:38:57,813 --> 01:38:59,231
To go to Ohio.

1875
01:39:01,859 --> 01:39:03,193
Two weeks.

1876
01:39:04,361 --> 01:39:05,904
On my friend's farm.

1877
01:39:08,991 --> 01:39:12,744
And one time, Steven and I did
a weekend in San Francisco.

1878
01:39:14,162 --> 01:39:17,749
I thought that I'd be safe here.

1879
01:39:18,709 --> 01:39:20,377
Just stay in Paradise.

1880
01:39:21,420 --> 01:39:23,839
Stay with him. Follow the rules.

1881
01:39:26,341 --> 01:39:28,260
And nothing bad
could truly happen.

1882
01:39:30,470 --> 01:39:32,306
But that's no way
to live a life.

1883
01:39:34,099 --> 01:39:35,434
Hiding away.

1884
01:39:37,477 --> 01:39:40,606
[sighs] That's one thing I'd
change if we get out of here.

1885
01:39:42,274 --> 01:39:43,692
I'd take a trip.

1886
01:39:45,611 --> 01:39:46,737
[breathes shakily]

1887
01:39:50,365 --> 01:39:52,576
I'd take Jake to Legoland.

1888
01:39:53,911 --> 01:39:54,912
[sniffles]

1889
01:39:55,454 --> 01:39:57,748
Or Africa maybe. I don't know.

1890
01:39:58,248 --> 01:39:59,249
[sighs]

1891
01:39:59,750 --> 01:40:01,293
I would love to see elephants.

1892
01:40:03,295 --> 01:40:06,798
Animals at a watering hole.

1893
01:40:07,883 --> 01:40:09,885
Anything really. Just anything.

1894
01:40:12,262 --> 01:40:13,722
Before it's too late.

1895
01:40:15,599 --> 01:40:17,852
[chuckling]

1896
01:40:17,935 --> 01:40:20,604
[chuckles] Why are you laughing?

1897
01:40:22,898 --> 01:40:24,108
Ah.

1898
01:40:24,191 --> 01:40:26,735
I've spent my entire life
trying to escape Paradise,

1899
01:40:26,818 --> 01:40:31,073
and now for some reason all I
wanna do is make a go of it here.

1900
01:40:32,574 --> 01:40:33,951
Why did you wanna leave?

1901
01:40:35,369 --> 01:40:38,038
[Kevin] You know, when I first got
the call to go pick up the kids,

1902
01:40:38,121 --> 01:40:41,208
uh, I started to
think that maybe...

1903
01:40:44,253 --> 01:40:48,883
maybe I could earn a second chance
if I just got the kids out safe,

1904
01:40:48,966 --> 01:40:50,133
you know?

1905
01:40:51,635 --> 01:40:54,137
Except they don't always work
that way. Second chances.

1906
01:40:55,931 --> 01:40:57,266
[Mary] Why do you say that?

1907
01:41:01,854 --> 01:41:04,857
The last time I spoke to
my dad was 28 years ago.

1908
01:41:08,569 --> 01:41:11,405
I was 16. It was
Christmas Eve. And, uh...

1909
01:41:14,616 --> 01:41:15,701
We got into a fight.

1910
01:41:16,869 --> 01:41:19,789
Something about me not
finishing what I started.

1911
01:41:19,872 --> 01:41:23,375
Same kind of shit, same
fight it always was.

1912
01:41:24,168 --> 01:41:25,502
Anyway, he, uh...

1913
01:41:26,628 --> 01:41:29,048
He came at me, you know,

1914
01:41:29,131 --> 01:41:31,634
like he... like he usually had
and done so many times before.

1915
01:41:31,717 --> 01:41:34,219
And for whatever reason,
on this night, I snapped.

1916
01:41:35,470 --> 01:41:40,392
I went at him s... screaming and
swinging and next thing I knew,

1917
01:41:40,475 --> 01:41:43,145
I slammed the front door
and cursed his name.

1918
01:41:43,228 --> 01:41:44,980
Told him I never wanted
to see him again.

1919
01:41:45,063 --> 01:41:47,149
He then said, "I
wish you were dead."

1920
01:41:48,609 --> 01:41:50,611
First, it was pride, you know?

1921
01:41:52,446 --> 01:41:57,451
Then after a few years,
my life went to shit.

1922
01:41:59,870 --> 01:42:01,079
Turned to shame.

1923
01:42:02,915 --> 01:42:06,668
A few months ago, I was working
the night shift back in Reno.

1924
01:42:08,670 --> 01:42:10,255
And that's when I got the call.

1925
01:42:11,840 --> 01:42:13,092
It was my mom.

1926
01:42:13,175 --> 01:42:15,302
She said, "You know, Kevin,
your dad's real sick.

1927
01:42:15,385 --> 01:42:16,553
You need to come home."

1928
01:42:18,055 --> 01:42:19,139
Drove all night.

1929
01:42:21,016 --> 01:42:22,142
But I was too late.

1930
01:42:24,603 --> 01:42:26,021
He died that morning.

1931
01:42:28,190 --> 01:42:31,360
I was too late... as a son.

1932
01:42:33,820 --> 01:42:35,572
Now I'm too late as a father.

1933
01:42:40,869 --> 01:42:43,164
How many times my son's
reached out to me?

1934
01:42:43,247 --> 01:42:45,332
[crying]

1935
01:42:49,503 --> 01:42:50,587
And now it's too late.

1936
01:42:51,880 --> 01:42:52,965
I didn't show up.

1937
01:42:53,507 --> 01:42:54,508
[sniffles]

1938
01:43:02,850 --> 01:43:04,059
[Mary] It's not too late.

1939
01:43:07,104 --> 01:43:08,272
It's up to you.

1940
01:43:12,317 --> 01:43:13,986
-Fire!
-[gasps]

01:43:16,697 --> 01:43:17,865
Oh, shit.

1943
01:43:17,948 --> 01:43:19,157
[Mary] There's fire.

1944
01:43:26,290 --> 01:43:28,125
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

1945
01:43:31,879 --> 01:43:33,255
-[student] Behind us.
-Fire in the back.

1946
01:43:33,338 --> 01:43:34,799
There's fire in the
back. I'll be right back.

1947
01:43:34,882 --> 01:43:41,263
Kevin! Kevin! Kevin, it's in the
back. It's in the back of the bus.

1948
01:43:41,346 --> 01:43:43,349
-There's fire.
-Here. Go, go, go. Okay.

1949
01:43:43,432 --> 01:43:45,017
Oh, God. [pants]

-The spray.
-Go back to the bus.

Go back to the bus.
Go back to the bus!

1966
01:44:27,059 --> 01:44:28,561
Where are you going?

-No! No! Kevin!

Okay.
