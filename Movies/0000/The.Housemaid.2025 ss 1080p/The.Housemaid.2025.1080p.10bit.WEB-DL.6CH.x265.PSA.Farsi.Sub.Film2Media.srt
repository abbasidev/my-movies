Eight years ago,
she showed up on my doorstep

It seems to me this is

02:00:45,663 --> 02:00:47,665
just one of those

Sometimes bad things happen

We gather here today
to mourn the tragic passing

of Andrew Winchester.

2298
02:01:15,693 --> 02:01:17,084
Devoted son,

02:01:17,085 --> 02:01:19,783
dedicated husband and father,

2300
02:01:19,784 --> 02:01:22,612
a respected business leader,

2301
02:01:22,613 --> 02:01:25,702

His untimely death has
left us all

with a sense of shock,

2304
02:01:29,750 --> 02:01:32,274
that such a vital
and caring man could

2305
02:01:32,275 --> 02:01:34,580
suddenly be taken from us.

2306
02:01:34,581 --> 02:01:40,412
We struggle in these times
to understand God's plan,

2307
02:01:40,413 --> 02:01:43,808
and it is natural to question
God's power in times of grief.

2308

never lose our faith

That a tooth was gone?

2326
02:02:32,030 --> 02:02:33,900
If you don't take care
of your teeth,

2327
02:02:33,901 --> 02:02:36,034
you lose the privilege
of having them,

2328
02:02:36,991 --> 02:02:38,950
