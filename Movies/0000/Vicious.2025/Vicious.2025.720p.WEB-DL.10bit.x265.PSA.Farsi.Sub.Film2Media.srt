1
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:41,075
<i>I don't want to be me.</i>

2
00:00:43,377 --> 00:00:45,246
<i>Is that a weird thing to say?</i>

3
00:00:47,881 --> 00:00:49,083
<i>It's true.</i>

4
00:00:50,984 --> 00:00:53,887
<i>So tired of feeling
like none of it matters.</i>

5
00:00:56,857 --> 00:00:59,760
I try so fucking hard.

6
00:01:02,396 --> 00:01:05,166
I bang my head against
the fucking wall.

7
00:01:08,769 --> 00:01:10,304
Every minute.

8
00:01:11,805 --> 00:01:13,507
Every second.

9
00:01:17,245 --> 00:01:19,113
But nothing changes.

10
00:01:23,151 --> 00:01:24,685
It doesn't get better.

11
00:01:30,658 --> 00:01:32,126
I'm still right here.

12
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:38,098
And it's all the same.

13
00:01:41,969 --> 00:01:43,371
What do you want?

14
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:48,609
For it to stop.

15
00:03:38,719 --> 00:03:40,288
<i>Hey, Polly, it's Ryan.</i>

16
00:03:40,388 --> 00:03:43,324
<i>Uh, we haven't seen you in
pottery the past couple of weeks.</i>

17
00:03:43,424 --> 00:03:45,910
<i>You know, you still have
six pre-paid classes left.</i>

18
00:03:45,993 --> 00:03:49,162
<i>Did you want us to
pause your membership?</i>

19
00:03:49,263 --> 00:03:51,932
<i>Email back and, uh,
let me know. Okay, bye.</i>

20
00:03:54,201 --> 00:03:59,239
<i>It's Lainie. This is a reminder
to pick up the cake on Thursday.</i>

21
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:01,926
<i>You said you could,
so don't flake.</i>

22
00:04:02,009 --> 00:04:04,478
<i>Anyway, let me know
how it goes tomorrow.</i>

23
00:04:07,848 --> 00:04:09,634
<i>Hey, kiddo, it's Bobby.</i>

24
00:04:09,717 --> 00:04:13,604
<i>Um, sorry to tell you this, but you've
gotta work that double tomorrow.</i>

25
00:04:13,687 --> 00:04:15,456
<i>Everyone else has got plans.</i>

26
00:04:17,858 --> 00:04:20,811
<i>This is Mom. You
didn't return my text.</i>

27
00:04:20,894 --> 00:04:23,948
<i>Anyway, did you print out
the forms you need to bring?</i>

28
00:04:24,031 --> 00:04:25,899
<i>Call me back if you
want to practice.</i>

29
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:15,282
<i>I have a lot to offer.</i>

30
00:05:15,383 --> 00:05:17,918
<i>I did well in school.</i>

31
00:05:18,018 --> 00:05:19,587
<i>People think I'm smart.</i>

32
00:05:22,856 --> 00:05:24,625
Why would anyone say that?

33
00:05:24,725 --> 00:05:27,828
Who would say that?
Definitely not a smart person.

34
00:05:36,470 --> 00:05:37,838
I'm a hard worker.

35
00:05:39,673 --> 00:05:43,544
I just got distracted.

36
00:05:45,513 --> 00:05:46,547
I think I...

37
00:05:47,948 --> 00:05:50,217
Uh, I think that the last
few years have been good.

38
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:53,754
And I think that I
just needed to...

39
00:05:57,791 --> 00:06:01,862
Miss Gibbons, what made you
want to come back to school?

40
00:06:08,068 --> 00:06:09,603
Because I'm supposed to.

41
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:30,858
Can I help you?

42
00:06:30,958 --> 00:06:34,161
Well, I... I don't...

43
00:06:36,597 --> 00:06:37,965
I don't know where I...

44
00:06:39,733 --> 00:06:42,102
Ma'am?

45
00:06:42,235 --> 00:06:44,638
I thought I knew
someone that lived here.

46
00:06:45,539 --> 00:06:48,308
I used to know someone
that lived here.

47
00:06:48,776 --> 00:06:50,410
I remembered.

48
00:06:51,445 --> 00:06:53,280
Or I thought I remembered.

49
00:06:54,281 --> 00:06:56,650
Mrs. Trott? She lives next door.

50
00:07:00,353 --> 00:07:02,623
A cab brought me.

51
00:07:02,756 --> 00:07:04,592
I have a number I can
call on the fridge.

52
00:07:04,692 --> 00:07:07,495
My son, he left me a
card in case I needed it.

53
00:07:07,595 --> 00:07:11,499
When they moved, his office
transferred him to New Jersey.

54
00:07:21,475 --> 00:07:23,176
Ma'am, do you wanna...

55
00:07:23,276 --> 00:07:25,796
Do you wanna come
in for a second?

56
00:07:25,879 --> 00:07:27,481
No. Get out of the cold?

57
00:07:29,282 --> 00:07:31,118
Come in. Thank you.

58
00:07:47,501 --> 00:07:49,369
We can have a seat
in the living room.

59
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:52,005
Can I... Can I have
a glass of water?

60
00:07:52,139 --> 00:07:53,841
Yeah, sure. I can
make you some tea.

61
00:07:53,974 --> 00:07:55,843
No, no, I don't
want to be a bother.

62
00:07:55,976 --> 00:07:57,110
Please. It's okay.

63
00:08:39,019 --> 00:08:40,754
Here. Come. Come, sit.

64
00:08:41,689 --> 00:08:42,756
I'm sorry.

65
00:08:44,357 --> 00:08:46,359
You're too kind. It's so late.

66
00:08:46,459 --> 00:08:47,728
Oh, it's all right.

67
00:08:48,662 --> 00:08:50,831
Here you go.

68
00:08:50,931 --> 00:08:53,500
Do you... Do you have your phone?
I can... I can call for you.

69
00:08:53,601 --> 00:08:55,903
Oh, no, I... I could
never make 'em work.

70
00:08:56,003 --> 00:08:59,139
Even the flip
ones. Tiny buttons.

71
00:08:59,239 --> 00:09:02,059
I have the number. My
son, he gave it to me,

72
00:09:02,142 --> 00:09:06,379
that if I was ever in
trouble, I... I could call.

73
00:09:06,479 --> 00:09:08,566
Yeah. Yeah, ma'am,
you told me already.

74
00:09:08,649 --> 00:09:10,751
You just relax. We'll
get you sorted out.

75
00:09:13,086 --> 00:09:15,956
It's so cold outside.
The fire feels nice.

76
00:09:20,093 --> 00:09:21,328
Are you married?

77
00:09:23,096 --> 00:09:24,615
No.

78
00:09:24,698 --> 00:09:27,735
So pretty, though. Thank you.

79
00:09:29,369 --> 00:09:30,771
Do you have children?

80
00:09:31,371 --> 00:09:32,472
A baby?

81
00:09:33,573 --> 00:09:34,842
Mmm-mmm. No.

82
00:09:42,282 --> 00:09:45,653
This house, it's a lot
for a young woman...

83
00:09:47,254 --> 00:09:49,089
Well, I'm not that
young anymore.

84
00:09:49,189 --> 00:09:51,141
You are to me.

85
00:09:51,224 --> 00:09:53,093
But isn't that the way it goes?

86
00:09:54,261 --> 00:09:55,963
Yeah, it belongs to my sister.

87
00:09:56,096 --> 00:09:58,148
She and her husband,
they rent it to me.

88
00:09:58,231 --> 00:09:59,984
They live across town.

89
00:10:00,067 --> 00:10:03,203
They have a little girl, and
wanted a bigger yard and all that.

90
00:10:03,303 --> 00:10:05,272
It's a nice place to live.

91
00:10:05,372 --> 00:10:08,909
Yeah, I'm very lucky. I
could never afford it.

92
00:10:09,009 --> 00:10:12,212
I should take little
better care of it, but...

93
00:10:12,312 --> 00:10:13,781
How old is your niece?

94
00:10:15,482 --> 00:10:18,418
Aly's five. About to turn six.

95
00:10:18,518 --> 00:10:20,304
She's having a big
party next week.

96
00:10:20,387 --> 00:10:22,723
That's nice. It's a good age.

97
00:10:22,823 --> 00:10:24,658
I'm sure it is.

98
00:10:24,792 --> 00:10:26,626
So much more to do.

99
00:10:38,305 --> 00:10:39,807
I'm gonna start now.

100
00:10:42,409 --> 00:10:43,677
What?

101
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:48,749
Ma'am, are you okay?

102
00:10:53,787 --> 00:10:57,041
If you wanna give me that
card, I can call for you.

103
00:10:57,124 --> 00:10:58,491
I can get my phone and...

104
00:11:09,703 --> 00:11:11,504
This will be for you now.

105
00:11:29,757 --> 00:11:32,559
Maybe... Maybe we
should wait outside.

106
00:11:33,193 --> 00:11:34,828
You're going to die.

107
00:11:37,130 --> 00:11:38,698
I'm sorry. But it's true.

108
00:11:45,005 --> 00:11:46,256
What are you talking about?

109
00:11:46,339 --> 00:11:49,042
You can be sad. You can be scared.
You can be a lot of things.

110
00:11:49,176 --> 00:11:50,543
It doesn't matter.

111
00:11:50,643 --> 00:11:52,245
It doesn't change the truth.

112
00:11:52,379 --> 00:11:54,281
You are going to die.

113
00:11:55,382 --> 00:11:56,583
Tonight.

114
00:11:58,518 --> 00:11:59,753
Unless...

115
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,589
Unless I don't...
I don't understand.

116
00:12:02,722 --> 00:12:04,191
You won't.

117
00:12:04,291 --> 00:12:06,410
I think that you're a little bit
confused and that you need to leave.

118
00:12:06,493 --> 00:12:08,996
I remembered someone
who lived here.

119
00:12:09,096 --> 00:12:10,663
That was a long time ago.

120
00:12:10,764 --> 00:12:13,233
It doesn't matter
though. Not really.

121
00:12:13,333 --> 00:12:14,267
What do you want?

122
00:12:14,401 --> 00:12:16,436
You have to do things.

123
00:12:24,611 --> 00:12:26,613
You were so kind to me.

124
00:12:28,315 --> 00:12:29,783
Thank you for the water.

125
00:12:29,883 --> 00:12:31,435
I'm gonna call the
police now, okay?

126
00:12:31,518 --> 00:12:32,770
You can't do that. I will.

127
00:12:32,853 --> 00:12:33,921
I wouldn't.

128
00:12:34,587 --> 00:12:36,689
Don't tell anyone.

129
00:12:36,790 --> 00:12:38,826
I wouldn't tell anyone at all.

130
00:12:38,926 --> 00:12:40,360
Don't you dare.

131
00:12:41,761 --> 00:12:43,296
Get up.

132
00:12:43,396 --> 00:12:44,965
You need to leave.
This is not okay.

133
00:12:45,098 --> 00:12:46,766
They're yours now.
No, I don't want them.

134
00:12:46,867 --> 00:12:48,953
You need them. No, I want
you to get out of my house.

135
00:12:49,036 --> 00:12:51,655
I don't know what's wrong with
you, but you have three minutes,

136
00:12:51,738 --> 00:12:53,540
and then I'm gonna
call the police, okay?

137
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:55,308
You got every right to be upset.

138
00:12:55,408 --> 00:12:57,127
This is the worst
thing I've ever done.

139
00:12:57,210 --> 00:12:59,646
This is not okay, what you're
doing. Do you get that?

140
00:12:59,779 --> 00:13:01,982
So you need to leave.
Please, go home.

141
00:13:06,386 --> 00:13:07,420
Polly?

142
00:13:15,495 --> 00:13:16,796
How do you know my name?

143
00:13:18,431 --> 00:13:20,367
I thought it was a nightmare.

144
00:13:22,169 --> 00:13:23,703
But I didn't wake up.

145
00:13:26,239 --> 00:13:27,841
You won't wake up.

146
00:13:32,412 --> 00:13:33,446
I'm sorry.

147
00:14:15,188 --> 00:14:16,206
Mom? <i>Hey, there.</i>

148
00:14:16,289 --> 00:14:17,875
<i>Did you get your form you
need to bring?</i> No, wait.

149
00:14:17,958 --> 00:14:19,709
The most fucked-up
thing just happened.

150
00:14:19,792 --> 00:14:22,062
<i>What is it?</i> So,
there was this woman.

151
00:14:22,162 --> 00:14:23,914
She came to the
door. I let her in.

152
00:14:23,997 --> 00:14:26,366
She said she was
looking for somebody.

153
00:14:26,499 --> 00:14:28,201
<i>What?</i> She was like 80 years old.

154
00:14:28,301 --> 00:14:30,403
<i>Hold on a second. You let
someone in your house?</i>

155
00:14:30,537 --> 00:14:32,017
Mom, are you listening?
<i>I'm listening.</i>

156
00:14:32,105 --> 00:14:34,374
Okay, so, she came to the
door and I let her in,

157
00:14:34,507 --> 00:14:37,177
'cause she needed to
call a ride or something.

158
00:14:37,277 --> 00:14:41,381
And then she started...
It-It... It got all weird.

159
00:14:41,514 --> 00:14:44,417
<i>What happened?</i> She told
me I was gonna die.

160
00:14:45,485 --> 00:14:48,555
<i>Polly.</i> I was just
trying to be nice.

161
00:14:48,688 --> 00:14:51,091
<i>Honey, you're not
making any sense.</i>

162
00:14:51,191 --> 00:14:52,759
Mom, I don't know
what to tell you.

163
00:14:52,859 --> 00:14:56,246
It was creepy. She
had a box. <i>A box?</i>

164
00:14:56,329 --> 00:14:59,166
<i>What kind of box?</i> That's
what you're gonna ask me?

165
00:15:00,467 --> 00:15:02,535
<i>Well, was it a bomb?</i>

166
00:15:03,403 --> 00:15:06,406
No, Mom, it was not a bomb.

167
00:15:06,506 --> 00:15:08,092
That's the first thing
that I would've said.

168
00:15:08,175 --> 00:15:10,944
That's the first thing that people
say. "Oh, my God, it's a bomb." No.

169
00:15:12,245 --> 00:15:15,782
It was just an old wooden box.

170
00:15:17,017 --> 00:15:19,819
She left it on the road.
It's just sitting here.

171
00:15:21,154 --> 00:15:25,892
<i>Well, she was probably
just senile.</i> Maybe.

172
00:15:25,993 --> 00:15:29,929
<i>You said she was old. Maybe
she was confused, off her meds?</i>

173
00:15:34,034 --> 00:15:35,702
I don't know what she was.

174
00:15:35,802 --> 00:15:38,438
<i>But she's gone now?</i> Yeah.

175
00:15:39,372 --> 00:15:40,372
Yeah.

176
00:15:41,141 --> 00:15:43,476
<i>I'm sure you're okay, Baby Doll.</i>

177
00:15:43,610 --> 00:15:45,495
<i>If not, go over to Mrs. Trott.</i>

178
00:15:45,578 --> 00:15:47,147
Well, she's still out of town.

179
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:51,384
<i>I feel like that woman never sits
still since her husband died.</i>

180
00:15:51,484 --> 00:15:53,586
I should call the
police, don't you think?

181
00:15:53,686 --> 00:15:58,342
<i>Well, I think you need to
focus, but I'm sure it's fine.</i>

182
00:15:58,425 --> 00:16:00,260
She said I was gonna die.

183
00:16:00,994 --> 00:16:02,179
<i>Oh.</i>

184
00:16:02,262 --> 00:16:05,182
<i>It was probably just
some weird cult thing.</i>

185
00:16:05,265 --> 00:16:08,318
Okay. Mom, that doesn't
make it any better.

186
00:16:08,401 --> 00:16:12,339
You're not making it better with
anything that you're saying.

187
00:16:12,472 --> 00:16:14,474
<i>So, are you ready for tomorrow?</i>

188
00:16:14,607 --> 00:16:16,743
<i>Did you figure out
what you're gonna wear?</i>

189
00:16:16,843 --> 00:16:19,512
No. <i>Polly. You gotta focus.</i>

190
00:16:19,646 --> 00:16:20,847
<i>This is a big deal, sweetie.</i>

191
00:16:20,947 --> 00:16:22,315
<i>And Lainie called...</i>
Yeah, I know.

192
00:16:22,415 --> 00:16:23,867
That's why I got
off of work early,

193
00:16:23,950 --> 00:16:25,402
and I was planning on
doing that right now.

194
00:16:25,485 --> 00:16:27,204
And I know what Lainie
fuckin' did. <i>Okay, okay.</i>

195
00:16:27,287 --> 00:16:29,539
<i>Honey, it's gonna be
okay. I'm</i> 32 years old.

196
00:16:29,622 --> 00:16:31,158
I've had job interviews before,

197
00:16:31,258 --> 00:16:32,642
and I'm just thinking
about going back to school.

198
00:16:32,725 --> 00:16:34,911
I don't even know if that's
what I want. <i>I know. I know.</i>

199
00:16:34,994 --> 00:16:37,330
<i>But we have to start somewhere.</i>

200
00:16:37,464 --> 00:16:38,998
<i>I've been praying
on it, you know?</i>

201
00:16:39,099 --> 00:16:42,535
Yeah, I was being
a bitch. Sorry.

202
00:16:42,669 --> 00:16:46,239
<i>No. I just don't want you
distracted, that's all.</i>

203
00:16:46,339 --> 00:16:49,226
Okay... let me call
you back in a bit.

204
00:16:49,309 --> 00:16:52,912
I'm gonna try on some outfits.
I'll send you some pictures.

205
00:16:53,012 --> 00:16:56,015
Are you gonna be up for a
while? <i>I'll be up, Baby Doll.</i>

206
00:16:56,116 --> 00:16:57,817

I could have sworn I thought you
were here, just now, upstairs.

237
00:20:52,452 --> 00:20:55,254
I could hear your voice. I
could smell your perfume.

238
00:20:55,355 --> 00:20:58,425
<i>Polly, Baby Doll,
you gotta calm down.</i>

239
00:20:58,525 --> 00:21:00,493
Mom. <i>This is silly.</i>

240
00:21:02,729 --> 00:21:04,481
<i>Put it out.</i> Just
give me a second.

241
00:21:04,564 --> 00:21:07,967
<i>You said you were gonna quit.</i> I
know. I know, I know. I know. I will.

242
00:21:13,205 --> 00:21:15,274
<i>I think you're just nervous.</i>

243
00:21:16,175 --> 00:21:17,310
<i>Did you pick an outfit?</i>

244
00:21:17,410 --> 00:21:19,278
I don't know. I
don't fucking know.

245
00:21:19,412 --> 00:21:20,630
<i>You should eat something,</i>

246
00:21:20,713 --> 00:21:23,516
<i>because when you were here before,
I thought you looked skinny.</i>

247
00:21:28,788 --> 00:21:29,989
Hello?

248
00:21:34,293 --> 00:21:35,528
Hello?

249
00:21:39,732 --> 00:21:41,000
Anyone there?

250
00:21:44,937 --> 00:21:46,373
<i>Tell me what's happening.</i>

251
00:21:55,348 --> 00:21:57,984
<i>Check the closet.
Maybe I'm in there.</i>

252
00:21:58,084 --> 00:21:59,486
Shut up.

253
00:22:11,598 --> 00:22:14,567
<i>Polly, what do you see?</i>

254
00:22:16,636 --> 00:22:17,636
Nothing.

255
00:22:18,971 --> 00:22:21,273
I feel sick.

256
00:22:21,374 --> 00:22:26,178
<i>Well, I think you're ready, but
I think you should wear a jacket.</i>

257
00:22:26,278 --> 00:22:28,381
<i>That one you have, the blue one.</i>

258
00:22:31,050 --> 00:22:32,819
<i>I'm proud of you, Polly.</i>

259
00:22:32,919 --> 00:22:36,355
<i>This is gonna be a
big day. You'll see.</i>

260
00:22:45,398 --> 00:22:47,366
<i>You know what I was
thinking about this morning?</i>

261
00:22:47,467 --> 00:22:49,536
<i>Your first day of school.</i>

262
00:22:49,636 --> 00:22:51,070
<i>You probably don't
even remember,</i>

263
00:22:51,203 --> 00:22:55,207
<i>but Dad took you and Lainie
in that green truck of his,</i>

264
00:22:55,307 --> 00:22:58,144
<i>and you were so excited.</i>

265
00:23:00,146 --> 00:23:01,548
<i>Aw.</i>

266
00:23:01,648 --> 00:23:04,383
<i>You know, it doesn't have
to be so hard, Baby Doll.</i>

267
00:23:04,517 --> 00:23:05,818
<i>It really doesn't.</i>

268
00:23:05,918 --> 00:23:07,286
I'm so tired.

269
00:23:08,588 --> 00:23:10,623
<i>You're not even listening to me.</i>

270
00:23:13,493 --> 00:23:16,062
<i>It's getting late,
I should be in bed.</i>

271
00:23:16,162 --> 00:23:17,781
Mom, what if...

272
00:23:17,864 --> 00:23:19,398
<i>Yes, baby.</i>

273
00:23:22,535 --> 00:23:24,704
Nothing. Never mind.

274
00:23:28,775 --> 00:23:30,610
It's not gonna... I don't know.

275
00:23:37,884 --> 00:23:39,852
Mom? <i>What?</i>

276
00:23:43,155 --> 00:23:44,657
It's sitting right here.

277
00:23:45,424 --> 00:23:46,693
<i>What is?</i>

278
00:23:47,093 --> 00:23:48,227
The box.

279
00:23:49,061 --> 00:23:51,864
<i>Well, maybe you
carried it back inside.</i>

280
00:23:51,964 --> 00:23:53,032
I didn't.

281
00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:56,352
<i>Maybe you weren't thinking.</i>

282
00:23:56,435 --> 00:23:57,804
Why don't you believe me?

283
00:23:57,904 --> 00:24:01,774
<i>Honey, I always
believe you. Always.</i>

285
00:24:10,617 --> 00:24:11,718
<i>What do you see?</i>

286
00:24:30,202 --> 00:24:31,871
The sand's not falling.

287
00:24:33,472 --> 00:24:37,209
<i>Well, you haven't started yet.</i>

288
00:24:42,448 --> 00:24:43,716

289
00:24:45,451 --> 00:24:47,587

about the hourglass?

<i>Maybe.</i>

291
00:24:49,889 --> 00:24:51,891
I didn't though.

00:24:51,991 --> 00:24:55,662

00:32:21,607 --> 00:32:23,026
Um, please, I need
to use your phone.

347
00:32:23,109 --> 00:32:25,061
My phone's not working, and
I need to call the police.

348
00:32:25,144 --> 00:32:27,646
Hold on. Wait a second. I
thought you were a delivery.

349
00:32:27,779 --> 00:32:29,982
Uh, babe, hold on. Someone's...

350
00:32:30,082 --> 00:32:32,151
What's going on? I need
to use your phone, please.

351
00:32:32,251 --> 00:32:35,687
What's the matter? Can I...
Can I just come in? Please.

352
00:32:35,787 --> 00:32:36,839
You live around here? I
live across the street.

353
00:32:36,922 --> 00:32:38,757
You're the only
person that answered.

354
00:32:39,325 --> 00:32:40,659
It's late.

355
00:32:43,695 --> 00:32:45,164
My phone is not working.

356
00:32:45,264 --> 00:32:47,366
Baby, baby, just
give me one second.

357
00:32:47,466 --> 00:32:50,553
My husband's flying back from
Kentucky. He's at the airport.

358
00:32:50,636 --> 00:32:51,988
I just really need
to talk to someone.

359
00:32:52,071 --> 00:32:53,589
There's something
happening, and I need help.

360
00:32:53,672 --> 00:32:56,708
One second. I waited all day.

361
00:32:56,842 --> 00:33:00,446
I don't know. She says she
needs to call the police, but...

362
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:04,283
Did you talk to Oscar?

363
00:33:04,383 --> 00:33:05,717
He called about the fence.

364
00:33:05,817 --> 00:33:08,137
He can come tomorrow, but I'm
gonna have to call to confirm.

365
00:33:08,220 --> 00:33:09,555
I can call. I could do it.

366
00:33:09,688 --> 00:33:12,191
I can be here too. Yes, that's
fine. That's absolutely fine.

367
00:33:12,291 --> 00:33:15,361
No, I can be here all
day tomorrow. It's fine.

368
00:33:15,494 --> 00:33:19,748
Okay. Well, yeah,
I... I'll be here.

369
00:33:19,831 --> 00:33:22,901
Hold on. Sweetie, hang
on. Hold on. Ma'am?

370
00:33:23,035 --> 00:33:24,636
Someone keeps calling.

371
00:33:27,206 --> 00:33:29,441
I need help. Oh, hi!

372
00:33:31,577 --> 00:33:32,744
Yes.

373
00:33:33,612 --> 00:33:35,614
Yes. One second.

374
00:33:37,483 --> 00:33:39,085
The police just called.

375
00:33:39,385 --> 00:33:40,552
What?

376
00:33:41,487 --> 00:33:42,854
She just got here.

377
00:33:43,789 --> 00:33:45,691
What are they saying? Okay.

378
00:33:47,093 --> 00:33:48,227
Okay.

379
00:33:48,694 --> 00:33:50,296
Absolutely.

380
00:33:51,163 --> 00:33:53,199
Let me get right on that.

381
00:33:54,066 --> 00:33:55,267
Absolutely.

382
00:33:55,401 --> 00:33:58,470
See something, say something.
You can never be too careful.

383
00:33:58,570 --> 00:34:00,739
See something, say something.

384
00:34:03,942 --> 00:34:05,911
Look what you made me do.

385
00:34:15,421 --> 00:34:16,755
We are everywhere.

386
00:34:18,590 --> 00:34:20,159
We are nowhere.

387
00:34:46,051 --> 00:34:48,320
No one else can help you.

388
00:34:57,663 --> 00:35:03,802
No one ever could.

389
00:35:23,189 --> 00:35:24,690
I'm sorry.

390
00:35:24,823 --> 00:35:27,193
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

391
00:35:27,759 --> 00:35:29,060
I'm sorry.

392
00:35:30,829 --> 00:35:32,231
This isn't happening.

393
00:35:45,110 --> 00:35:46,578
Please, please.

394
00:35:53,552 --> 00:35:54,753
Oh, my God.

395
00:36:24,816 --> 00:36:26,552
Go away!

<i>Polly?</i>

403
00:37:01,987 --> 00:37:04,256

00:37:11,463 --> 00:37:12,631
You're not him.

<i>Hey, there, don't
talk like that.</i>

407
00:37:19,438 --> 00:37:22,708
I did what you said! I put
them in the fucking box!

408
00:37:22,808 --> 00:37:24,960

scared, didn't you?</i>

413
00:37:38,790 --> 00:37:42,528
<i>Always seeing things. under
your bed, in your closet.</i>

00:37:47,666 --> 00:37:50,302

I would search for you,</i>

416
00:37:50,402 --> 00:37:53,155
<i>but I never did find
anything, did I?</i>

417
00:37:53,238 --> 00:37:54,973
Please stop.

418
00:37:55,974 --> 00:37:58,377
<i>Maybe Daddy lied.</i>

419
00:37:59,244 --> 00:38:01,380
<i>Maybe we were always there.</i>

420
00:38:02,113 --> 00:38:03,349
<i>Maybe.</i>

421
00:38:05,451 --> 00:38:07,953

424
00:38:14,826 --> 00:38:17,563
<i>Why don't you pull
yourself up off that couch?</i>

425
00:38:18,997 --> 00:38:21,567
<i>You already know the answer.</i>

426
00:38:23,402 --> 00:38:24,969
<i>What do you hate, Polly?</i>

427
00:38:26,538 --> 00:38:28,374
<i>What did you believe in?</i>

428
00:38:31,343 --> 00:38:34,346
<i>What did you lose
the day I died?</i>

429
00:38:36,081 --> 00:38:37,383
<i>What are you hiding?</i>

430
00:38:38,950 --> 00:38:40,419
<i>We and I wonder.</i>

431
00:38:40,886 --> 00:38:42,187
You know...

432
00:42:46,131 --> 00:42:47,799
You let him die.

433
00:42:50,001 --> 00:42:51,469
You let him suffer.

434
00:42:54,272 --> 00:42:56,307
Dad prayed to you every day.

435
00:42:58,109 --> 00:42:59,778
I prayed to you every day.

436
00:43:05,884 --> 00:43:07,619
Is there something I hate?

437
00:43:16,762 --> 00:43:17,829
I hate you.

438
00:44:22,360 --> 00:44:23,895
<i>I see you.</i>

439
00:44:27,332 --> 00:44:28,834
<i>Polly?</i>

440
00:44:32,203 --> 00:44:33,739
<i>Do you see me?</i>

441
00:44:40,879 --> 00:44:42,113
<i>Bitch.</i>

Do you see me?

446
00:45:56,888 --> 00:45:58,456
What do you see?

447
00:45:59,124 --> 00:46:00,826
Tell me. Answer me.

448
00:46:00,926 --> 00:46:02,660
Did you hear what she said?

449
00:46:04,229 --> 00:46:05,496
You're scared.

450
00:46:07,465 --> 00:46:09,400
She thinks you're dumb. You are.

451
00:46:12,070 --> 00:46:14,840
You are dead! You are dead!

452
00:46:18,176 --> 00:46:21,179
You are dead!

453
00:46:37,996 --> 00:46:39,397
Oh, my God.

454
00:46:40,365 --> 00:46:41,666
Oh, my God!

455
00:46:56,982 --> 00:46:58,200
Hello?

456
00:46:58,283 --> 00:47:00,235
<i>Jesus, I've been calling
you for the last 20 minutes.</i>

457
00:47:00,318 --> 00:47:01,887
<i>Are you close?</i>

458
00:47:02,620 --> 00:47:03,922
Lainie? <i>Polly?</i>

00:47:04,956 --> 00:47:06,024
<i>Are you there?</i>

460
00:47:08,159 --> 00:47:10,061
<i>Polly?</i> How do I
know this is you?

461
00:47:10,695 --> 00:47:12,730
<i>What does that even mean?</i>

462
00:47:12,830 --> 00:47:15,450
<i>You call me, past 10:00, when I told you
not to call the home phone this late.</i>

463
00:47:15,533 --> 00:47:19,104
<i>You call me five times and
you tell me someone died?</i>

464
00:47:19,204 --> 00:47:22,440
<i>You said you were scared. You said
something could happen to Aly.</i>

465
00:47:22,540 --> 00:47:24,309
<i>What is going to happen to Aly?</i>

466
00:47:24,409 --> 00:47:26,561
I didn't call you. <i>You did.</i>

467
00:47:26,644 --> 00:47:29,231
<i>Tell me what's going on.</i> I cant.

468
00:47:29,314 --> 00:47:31,316
I can't. <i>Wait.</i>

469
00:47:32,583 --> 00:47:34,953
<i>Are you okay?</i> No.

470
00:47:36,621 --> 00:47:37,772
<i>Tell me what's going on.</i>

471
00:47:37,855 --> 00:47:39,074
You won't believe me.

472
00:47:39,157 --> 00:47:42,093
<i>Hey. What... There you are.
I see your car on the street.</i>

473
00:47:42,227 --> 00:47:43,594
<i>Why didn't you say
so?</i> Wait. Wait.

474
00:47:43,694 --> 00:47:45,563
<i>Just park over here.</i>
No, no! Don't let me in!

475
00:47:45,663 --> 00:47:47,232
No, don't let me in!

476
00:47:47,332 --> 00:47:48,332
Fuck!

477
00:48:55,500 --> 00:48:57,835
Think. Think.

478
00:48:58,736 --> 00:49:00,005
What do you want?

479
00:49:00,771 --> 00:49:02,107
Tell me.

480
00:49:03,241 --> 00:49:04,475
What do I need?

481
00:49:09,114 --> 00:49:10,114
Tell me.

482
00:49:11,482 --> 00:49:12,483
Please.

483
00:49:15,386 --> 00:49:17,422
<i>Whee!</i>

484
00:49:17,522 --> 00:49:18,522
<i>Time to go to bed now.</i>

485
00:49:23,761 --> 00:49:24,829
<i>Where is she?</i>

486
00:49:24,929 --> 00:49:26,264
<i>There she is!</i>

487
00:49:29,767 --> 00:49:31,169
<i>Peek-a-boo!</i>

488
00:49:31,269 --> 00:49:32,770
<i>Time to go to bed now.</i>

489
00:49:34,772 --> 00:49:36,041
<i>Where is she?</i>

490
00:49:39,910 --> 00:49:41,579
<i>Okay, give me that foot.</i>

491
00:49:43,481 --> 00:49:45,783
<i>This little piggy
went to market.</i>

492
00:49:45,883 --> 00:49:49,237
<i>This little piggy... This
little piggy stayed home.</i>

493
00:49:49,320 --> 00:49:52,023
<i>This little piggy... This
little piggy had roast beef.</i>

494
00:49:52,157 --> 00:49:54,192
<i>This little piggy had none.</i>

495
00:49:54,292 --> 00:49:59,030
<i>This little piggy cried "wee
wee wee" all the way home.</i>

496
00:49:59,130 --> 00:50:00,865
<i>This little piggy...
This little...</i>

497
00:50:05,670 --> 00:50:08,906
<i>Whee!</i>

<i>..."wee wee wee"

499
00:50:15,813 --> 00:50:17,748
<i>This little piggy had none.</i>

500
00:50:19,884 --> 00:50:22,070
This isn't happening.
This isn't happening.

501
00:50:22,153 --> 00:50:26,023
<i>..."wee wee wee"

This isn't happening!
This isn't happening!

504
00:50:29,527 --> 00:50:31,562
No, I won't!

505
00:50:31,662 --> 00:50:34,665
Not this, please! Please!

506
00:50:34,765 --> 00:50:38,086
Please. <i>This little
piggy stayed home.</i>

507
00:50:38,169 --> 00:50:41,272
<i>This little piggy
had roast beef.</i>

508
00:50:41,406 --> 00:50:43,425
<i>And this little piggy had none.</i>

509
00:50:43,508 --> 00:50:47,412
<i>This little piggy went...
This little piggy...</i>

510

00:50:54,185 --> 00:50:56,954
<i>Where is she? Where is she?</i>

513
00:50:57,054 --> 00:50:59,324
<i>This little piggy went...</i>

<i>..."wee wee wee" all the way
home... all the way home.</i>

515
00:51:11,302 --> 00:51:13,971
This is fucking crazy. <i>This
little piggy went to market.</i>

516
00:51:14,071 --> 00:51:16,324
<i>This little piggy stayed home.</i>

517

01:13:03,112 --> 01:13:05,048
I just need to call my sister.

706
01:13:06,249 --> 01:13:08,685
She just lives right
down the street.

707
01:13:09,586 --> 01:13:10,687
Right there.

708
01:13:15,725 --> 01:13:16,725
My name is Polly.

709
01:13:39,649 --> 01:13:40,817
Are you okay?

710
01:13:49,826 --> 01:13:50,826
No.

711
01:13:52,996 --> 01:13:54,097
No, I'm not.

712
01:13:59,903 --> 01:14:01,170
I'm really sorry.

713
01:14:02,906 --> 01:14:06,026
I'm sorry to bother you. I just
don't know what else to do.

714
01:14:06,109 --> 01:14:09,579
But if I am freaking you out, you
can call the police. I just...

715
01:14:10,079 --> 01:14:12,032
No, I'm just...

716
01:14:12,115 --> 01:14:13,650
You can tell me what happened.

717
01:14:17,286 --> 01:14:18,387
I can't.

718
01:14:26,029 --> 01:14:28,297
Uh, I'll be right back.

719
01:15:49,613 --> 01:15:52,181
My... My parents will be
home in a few minutes.

720
01:15:54,417 --> 01:15:59,088
Here. Drink this. I...
I made some tea tonight.

721
01:15:59,188 --> 01:16:00,790
It might help warm you up.

722
01:16:05,729 --> 01:16:06,729
What is that?

723
01:16:08,765 --> 01:16:10,099
Your name is Tara?

724
01:16:14,938 --> 01:16:17,040
How did you... How
did you know that?

725
01:16:17,874 --> 01:16:18,874
I just do.

726
01:16:24,814 --> 01:16:26,015
Thank you for the tea.

727
01:16:29,452 --> 01:16:32,005
That was really,
really nice of you.

728
01:16:32,088 --> 01:16:34,958
Look, um, I think... I think
that you should maybe go...

729
01:16:35,091 --> 01:16:37,193
I just knew it. I
can't explain it.

730
01:16:40,296 --> 01:16:43,032
You'll understand. You will.

731
01:16:44,901 --> 01:16:46,035
Soon.

732
01:16:47,837 --> 01:16:49,105
What's going on?

733
01:16:54,343 --> 01:16:55,679
I don't want to be me.

734
01:16:59,448 --> 01:17:01,217
Is that a weird thing to say?

735
01:17:05,154 --> 01:17:06,455
It's true.

736
01:17:07,991 --> 01:17:10,660
Tired of feeling like
none of it matters.

737
01:17:11,861 --> 01:17:13,096
I want it to...

738
01:17:14,430 --> 01:17:15,564
so bad.

739
01:17:18,401 --> 01:17:20,369
I can change everything.

740
01:17:24,107 --> 01:17:25,341
But not me.

741
01:17:30,013 --> 01:17:32,348
I try so fucking hard.

742
01:17:35,651 --> 01:17:38,187
I bang my head against
the fucking wall.

743
01:17:40,824 --> 01:17:42,191
Every minute...

744
01:17:45,061 --> 01:17:46,462
every second.

745
01:17:47,530 --> 01:17:49,365
But nothing changes.

746
01:17:51,567 --> 01:17:53,102
It doesn't get better.

747
01:17:55,404 --> 01:17:57,140
I'm still right here.

748
01:18:01,945 --> 01:18:03,579
And it's all the same.

749
01:18:04,647 --> 01:18:06,249
What do you want?

750
01:18:11,487 --> 01:18:12,922
For it to stop.

751
01:18:20,596 --> 01:18:22,231
I'm going to start now.

752
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:25,735
Your parents aren't coming home.

753
01:18:25,835 --> 01:18:28,905
That wasn't true. Was it?

754
01:18:33,409 --> 01:18:35,044
I think that you...
I know. I know.

755
01:18:36,479 --> 01:18:37,781
But it doesn't matter.

756
01:18:41,017 --> 01:18:42,651
This belongs to you now.

757
01:18:46,689 --> 01:18:49,092
No, no. Get up.

758
01:18:49,225 --> 01:18:51,912
Get up. Look, I was just trying to
be nice. You really need to leave.

759
01:18:51,995 --> 01:18:53,963
I don't know what
your fucking deal is.

760
01:19:00,403 --> 01:19:02,038
You're going to die.

761
01:19:55,358 --> 01:19:56,659
I'm sorry.

762
01:20:18,081 --> 01:20:20,283
It wants me...

763
01:20:21,017 --> 01:20:22,318
...to kill you.

764
01:20:27,056 --> 01:20:29,125
It won't let me go.

765
01:20:31,794 --> 01:20:34,130
You have to do things.

766
01:20:36,432 --> 01:20:38,935
It never, never stops.

767
01:20:40,569 --> 01:20:42,438
Get away from me.

768
01:20:42,571 --> 01:20:44,440
It wants you! No!

769
01:20:44,573 --> 01:20:47,127
Take it.

770
01:20:47,210 --> 01:20:48,210
No!

771
01:21:43,299 --> 01:21:45,134
Stop. Die.

772
01:21:45,234 --> 01:21:47,036
No! No!

773
01:21:57,646 --> 01:21:58,982
Please.

774
01:22:20,369 --> 01:22:21,504
Why?

775
01:22:24,207 --> 01:22:25,441
Why? Tell me.

776
01:22:27,276 --> 01:22:28,577
Why me?

777
01:22:34,783 --> 01:22:37,020
Someone knocked on my door.

778
01:22:42,691 --> 01:22:44,227
And I just opened it.

779
01:22:46,829 --> 01:22:48,697
No one ever knocks.

780
01:22:49,065 --> 01:22:50,266
Not anymore.

781
01:22:51,100 --> 01:22:54,603
Then someone finally...

782
01:22:59,042 --> 01:23:01,244
They could have
knocked anywhere.

783
01:23:03,246 --> 01:23:05,248
I could have knocked anywhere.

784
01:23:07,616 --> 01:23:08,717
But I didn't.

785
01:23:11,420 --> 01:23:13,656
I think it chooses us...

786
01:23:15,758 --> 01:23:19,462
because we are broken.

787
01:23:22,431 --> 01:23:24,267
You were nice. I can tell.

788
01:23:28,404 --> 01:23:29,872
It doesn't matter.

789
01:23:32,208 --> 01:23:33,976
I tried so hard.

790
01:23:35,411 --> 01:23:38,180
The things we do to ourselves.

791
01:23:44,019 --> 01:23:45,788
It's never enough.

792
01:23:48,857 --> 01:23:52,261
Alas, everything I was...

793
01:23:53,996 --> 01:23:56,132
everything I could be...

794
01:24:02,105 --> 01:24:04,107
I was so afraid.

795
01:24:07,443 --> 01:24:09,512
The box needs that.

796
01:24:10,546 --> 01:24:13,282
The sand needs it.

797
01:24:18,487 --> 01:24:20,556
Don't be afraid of dying.

798
01:24:22,057 --> 01:24:25,594
Don't be afraid.

799
01:24:34,937 --> 01:24:36,205
Thank you.

800
01:25:14,277 --> 01:25:16,545
<i>Aly's five. She's
about to turn six.</i>

801
01:25:16,679 --> 01:25:19,865
We're having a birthday
party for her next week.

802
01:25:19,948 --> 01:25:22,718
That's nice. It's a good age.

803
01:25:23,118 --> 01:25:24,537
I'm sure it is.

804
01:25:24,620 --> 01:25:26,222
So much more to do.

805
01:25:27,990 --> 01:25:29,425
I'm gonna start now.

806
01:25:30,559 --> 01:25:31,559
What?

807
01:25:32,795 --> 01:25:33,996
Ma'am, are you okay?

808
01:25:35,464 --> 01:25:39,252
If you wanna give me that card,
I can call you a car or...

809
01:25:39,335 --> 01:25:43,239
I can get my phone
and call you an Uber.

810
01:25:43,372 --> 01:25:45,208
<i>This will be for you now.</i>

811
01:25:57,085 --> 01:26:00,122
<i>You are going to die.</i>

812
01:26:00,789 --> 01:26:02,225
<i>Unless...</i>

813
01:26:02,358 --> 01:26:04,560
<i>Unless, unless, unless,
unless, unless, unless...</i>

814
01:26:05,928 --> 01:26:08,130
<i>You don't want that
sand running out.</i>

815
01:26:08,231 --> 01:26:09,749
<i>Unless, unless, unless...</i>

816
01:26:09,832 --> 01:26:12,468
<i>It's too hard, too scary.</i>

817
01:26:14,903 --> 01:26:17,072
I won't do it anymore.

818
01:26:17,172 --> 01:26:18,958
<i>Come and see.</i>

819
01:26:19,041 --> 01:26:21,143
<i>Did you feel something then?</i>

820
01:26:21,244 --> 01:26:23,746
<i>You whore! You said
you will not desire.</i>

821
01:26:23,846 --> 01:26:24,764
<i>Help me!</i>

822
01:26:24,847 --> 01:26:27,250
<i>What do you love?</i>

823
01:26:29,452 --> 01:26:31,271
<i>No! No! No!</i>

824
01:26:31,354 --> 01:26:34,957
<i>You're wasting time, Baby Doll.</i>

825
01:26:36,525 --> 01:26:39,227
<i>You are going to die.</i>

826
01:26:42,798 --> 01:26:44,867
<i>I don't want to be me.</i>

827
01:26:44,967 --> 01:26:46,469
<i>You are dead!</i>

828
01:26:48,271 --> 01:26:50,806
<i>Unless, unless, unless...</i>

829
01:26:53,709 --> 01:26:55,344
<i>You are dead!</i>

830
01:28:10,085 --> 01:28:11,420
Polly?

831
01:29:12,615 --> 01:29:13,682
Aly!

832
01:29:21,390 --> 01:29:23,125
Oh, I love you.

833
01:29:24,393 --> 01:29:25,661
I love you.

834
01:29:33,436 --> 01:29:35,237
Mama's pissed at you.

835
01:29:36,439 --> 01:29:38,674
Mama's always pissed at me.

836
01:29:40,609 --> 01:29:42,110
What happened to you?

837
01:29:52,955 --> 01:29:54,490
What did you do?

838
01:29:59,595 --> 01:30:01,664
Tell Mom I'll be
right back, okay?

839
01:30:04,066 --> 01:30:05,233
Okay?

840
01:30:50,713 --> 01:30:52,715
You can't play, okay?

841
01:30:54,049 --> 01:30:56,685
Give it to me. What?

842
01:30:56,785 --> 01:30:59,087
Listen to me. I should
never have given it to you.

843
01:31:00,088 --> 01:31:01,156
Give me the box.

844
01:31:02,725 --> 01:31:05,193
What are you talking
about? Do it, now.

845
01:31:08,396 --> 01:31:09,665
Who are you?

846
01:31:10,733 --> 01:31:11,733
What?

847
01:31:13,168 --> 01:31:14,737
I... I think you're confused.

848
01:31:14,837 --> 01:31:17,372
My parents and I,
we just got back.

849
01:31:17,472 --> 01:31:19,542
We were on vacation
for Christmas.

850
01:31:20,643 --> 01:31:22,244
You have the wrong house.

851
01:31:25,147 --> 01:31:26,549
Oh...

852
01:31:27,583 --> 01:31:28,584
I thought... I'm sorry.

853
01:31:28,717 --> 01:31:31,119
It's all right. I'm sorry.

854
01:31:55,811 --> 01:31:57,212
I'll be in in a minute.

855
01:32:01,049 --> 01:32:02,450
Come on.

856
01:35:37,465 --> 01:35:43,105
Something you... want.
