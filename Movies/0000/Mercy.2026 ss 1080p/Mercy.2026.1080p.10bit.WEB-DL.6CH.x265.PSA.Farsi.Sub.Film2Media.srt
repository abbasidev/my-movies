1
00:00:55,666 --> 00:00:57,125
Please pay
close attention

2
00:00:57,291 --> 00:00:59,333
to this important
announcement.

3
00:01:37,458 --> 00:01:40,583
Millions of people
have been affected by crime.

4
00:01:43,375 --> 00:01:46,291
Civil unrest
was at an all-time high...

5
00:01:46,458 --> 00:01:48,541
and mass unemployment
and homelessness...

6
00:01:48,708 --> 00:01:51,083
drove Los Angeles
into a crime epidemic.

7
00:01:52,083 --> 00:01:54,208
Prisons were overcrowded...

8
00:01:55,208 --> 00:01:57,083
...citywide Red Zones
were established...

9
00:01:57,250 --> 00:01:58,500
to restrict individuals

10
00:01:58,666 --> 00:02:00,833
implicated
in violent activities...

11
00:02:03,333 --> 00:02:05,625
...and still, hundreds
of our heroes in blue...

12
00:02:05,791 --> 00:02:07,291
were killed
in the line of duty.

13
00:02:07,458 --> 00:02:10,208
Now, extreme circumstances
call for extreme measures.

14
00:02:10,375 --> 00:02:12,291
We need the Mercy Court...

15
00:02:12,458 --> 00:02:13,833
and I will be encouraging
my colleagues

16
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,333
on both sides of the aisle...

17
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:16,500
to support it.

18
00:02:17,916 --> 00:02:19,750
After two years
in operation...

19
00:02:19,916 --> 00:02:21,458
this program is the reason

20
00:02:21,625 --> 00:02:23,250
you can sleep
peacefully at night.

21
00:02:24,166 --> 00:02:25,458
Violent capital offenders

22
00:02:25,625 --> 00:02:28,125
are now judged
by artificial intelligence...

23
00:02:28,291 --> 00:02:30,333
which reduces
the need for lengthy trials...

24
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:32,416
by acting as judge...

25
00:02:32,583 --> 00:02:33,583
jury...

26
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:35,000
and executioner.

27
00:02:35,166 --> 00:02:37,041
In this fully
autonomous courtroom...

28
00:02:37,208 --> 00:02:39,583
suspects
are presumed guilty...

29
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:41,500
unless proven innocent.

30
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:45,750
Mercy analyzes it all
with pinpoint precision...

31
00:02:45,916 --> 00:02:48,000
drawing on an immense
range of data...

32
00:02:48,166 --> 00:02:51,000
including evidence
provided by the LAPD...

33
00:02:51,166 --> 00:02:52,708
and its quadcopter team.

34
00:02:52,875 --> 00:02:54,416
Since launching
this program...

35
00:02:54,583 --> 00:02:57,083
Mercy has already
impartially judged...

36
00:02:57,250 --> 00:03:00,416
sentenced and executed
18 individuals...

37
00:03:01,916 --> 00:03:04,666
cutting crime
in the city by 68%...

38
00:03:04,833 --> 00:03:06,625
saving billions
of tax dollars...

39
00:03:06,791 --> 00:03:08,833
due to the accuracy
and efficiency

40
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,083
of the program.

41
00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:12,791
Mercy uses hard facts
and a wealth of evidence...

42
00:03:12,958 --> 00:03:15,416
to ensure justice is served...

43
00:03:15,583 --> 00:03:18,375
within hours of a murder
being committed.

44
00:03:18,541 --> 00:03:20,416
It's the ultimate
crime deterrent.

45
00:03:20,583 --> 00:03:22,958
The freedoms that
all Americans cherish...

46
00:03:23,125 --> 00:03:24,541
are now protected by a system

47
00:03:24,708 --> 00:03:26,333
designed
to eliminate threats...

48
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:28,291
quickly and efficiently.

49
00:03:28,458 --> 00:03:31,458
The future of law enforcement
is Mercy...

50
00:03:32,125 --> 00:03:34,541
and you are its next case.

51
00:03:35,791 --> 00:03:37,250
To ensure a fair trial...

52
00:03:37,416 --> 00:03:38,416
you, the accused,

53
00:03:38,583 --> 00:03:40,708
will have access
to crime scene evidence...

54
00:03:40,875 --> 00:03:42,666
and your complete
digital footprint.

55
00:03:43,083 --> 00:03:44,166
Holy shit.

56
00:03:44,333 --> 00:03:45,333
- Hey. Hey.
- You will have a chance

57
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:46,500
to defend yourself...

58
00:03:46,666 --> 00:03:47,958
- How the hell did I get here?
- ...but understand...

59
00:03:48,125 --> 00:03:50,666
Mercy does not make mistakes.

60
00:03:52,041 --> 00:03:53,041
Your city thanks you

61
00:03:53,208 --> 00:03:54,875
for participating
in the Mercy program.

62
00:03:55,041 --> 00:03:57,458
Your contribution will restore
peace and stability

63
00:03:57,625 --> 00:03:58,958
to our communities.

64
00:03:59,291 --> 00:04:00,875
Mercy is justice

65
00:04:01,041 --> 00:04:03,083
- for a better future.
- Get me out of this chair.

66
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:04,250
You have been assigned

67
00:04:04,416 --> 00:04:05,875
- case number 19.
- Hello?

68
00:04:06,041 --> 00:04:09,708
Hello!

69
00:04:13,666 --> 00:04:15,250
This is
the Mercy Capital Court.

70
00:04:15,416 --> 00:04:16,416
I'm Judge Maddox.

71
00:04:16,583 --> 00:04:18,208
I will preside
over your trial today.

72
00:04:18,375 --> 00:04:20,833
Wait. No, no, no.
What are you talking about?

73
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,416
There is no trial.

74
00:04:23,041 --> 00:04:24,166
I'm Detective Raven.

75
00:04:24,333 --> 00:04:26,666
Please exhale
a deep breath.

76
00:04:26,833 --> 00:04:28,833
Hold on. Just wait a...
Wait a second.

77
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:30,666
- Identity is confirmed.
- Okay...

78
00:04:30,833 --> 00:04:32,458
Please exhale
a deep breath.

79
00:04:32,625 --> 00:04:34,416
I put eight people
in this chair.

80
00:04:34,583 --> 00:04:36,041
I'm Chris Raven
from robbery-homicide.

81
00:04:36,208 --> 00:04:37,208
I don't belong here.

82
00:04:37,375 --> 00:04:40,083
Please exhale, Mr. Raven.

83
00:04:41,375 --> 00:04:42,875
Thank you.

84
00:04:43,041 --> 00:04:44,333
Your blood alcohol level

85
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:46,125
has now reduced
sufficiently for trial.

86
00:04:46,291 --> 00:04:47,583
Wait. How long was I out?

87
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:50,291
- 5 hours, 26 minutes.
- Man.

88
00:04:50,458 --> 00:04:51,833
Before we proceed,
you must swear

89
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
that all testimony
you give this court...

90
00:04:54,166 --> 00:04:56,500
will be honest and truthful.

91
00:04:57,958 --> 00:04:58,958
Wait.

92
00:05:00,708 --> 00:05:01,708
Hold on. Just hold on.

93
00:05:01,875 --> 00:05:02,875
Wait a second.
This can't be real.

94
00:05:03,041 --> 00:05:05,166
I assure you,
this is very real.

95
00:05:05,333 --> 00:05:06,416
You must swear an oath.

96
00:05:06,583 --> 00:05:08,208
Look, if you think
that this is real...

97
00:05:08,375 --> 00:05:10,166
you are making
a very big mistake.

98
00:05:10,333 --> 00:05:11,791
And if there
is a mistake,

99
00:05:11,958 --> 00:05:13,041
I will uncover it...

100
00:05:13,208 --> 00:05:15,875
but you must comply
with the rules before I can.

101
00:05:16,041 --> 00:05:18,000
Okay, fine. Fine. I swear.

102
00:05:18,166 --> 00:05:19,375
What do you swear?

103
00:05:20,625 --> 00:05:23,333
Well, to tell
the damn truth, okay?

104
00:05:24,166 --> 00:05:25,166
And maybe you can tell me
what I'm supposed

105
00:05:25,333 --> 00:05:26,333
to be telling
the truth about...

106
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:28,375
- because whatever it is...
- Christopher Raven,

107
00:05:28,541 --> 00:05:29,541
you're before
this court today...

108
00:05:29,708 --> 00:05:32,166
charged with the murder
of your wife.

109
00:05:32,333 --> 00:05:33,375
Nicole Raven.

110
00:05:43,583 --> 00:05:45,125
- Where's the vic?
- In the kitchen.

111
00:05:45,291 --> 00:05:46,125
Over here!

112
00:05:47,583 --> 00:05:49,041
- We need a medic!
- What?

113
00:05:49,208 --> 00:05:50,166
Is anyone else
in here?

114
00:05:50,333 --> 00:05:52,250
No. There's no one
else here. It's just me.

115
00:05:52,416 --> 00:05:53,500
Yeah,
we're comin' in hot.

116
00:05:53,666 --> 00:05:54,666
There's no one here.
It's just my mom!

117
00:05:54,833 --> 00:05:56,000
- Yeah, are you all right?
- Yeah...

118
00:05:56,166 --> 00:05:57,666
Paramedics
on scene.

119
00:05:57,833 --> 00:05:59,375
I don't know
what happened to her!

120
00:05:59,541 --> 00:06:01,500
Female,
stab victim, suspect unknown.

121
00:06:01,666 --> 00:06:02,791
Ma'am,
you're gonna be okay.

122
00:06:02,958 --> 00:06:05,208
Try to stay as still
as possible. Okay?

123
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,541
Yeah, I'm trying.
Please help her!

124
00:06:08,708 --> 00:06:09,875
Who did this
to you?

125
00:06:10,666 --> 00:06:11,750
Please help my mom.

126
00:06:11,916 --> 00:06:13,375
Who?

127
00:06:13,541 --> 00:06:14,666
Chris.

128
00:06:14,833 --> 00:06:16,291
That's impossible.

129
00:06:16,833 --> 00:06:17,833
Oh, my God.

130
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:18,833
This court
will now present...

131
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
an opening statement

132
00:06:20,166 --> 00:06:22,041
evidencing your extensive ties
to the victim.

133
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:24,708
- Oh, my God! Oh, Jesus Christ!
- Culminating today...

134
00:06:24,875 --> 00:06:27,291
when you and you alone were
in the house with Nicole...

135
00:06:27,458 --> 00:06:29,750
at the time that
she was stabbed to death.

136
00:06:29,916 --> 00:06:31,208
You're lying to me.

137
00:06:31,375 --> 00:06:33,041
I urge you
to check for yourself.

138
00:06:34,041 --> 00:06:36,333
Voice commands
and touch-sensitive controls

139
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:37,541
are available to you.

140
00:06:40,625 --> 00:06:41,625
Okay.

141
00:06:44,166 --> 00:06:45,166
Mr. Raven...

142
00:06:45,333 --> 00:06:47,541
...voice commands
and touch-sensitive controls

143
00:06:47,708 --> 00:06:48,833
- are available to you.
- Just search...

144
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,083
Can you search Nicole Raven?

145
00:07:04,208 --> 00:07:05,833
LAPD Officer
Chris Raven...

146
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,708
has been arrested today
for the murder of his wife.

147
00:07:08,875 --> 00:07:10,791
Raven and his partner,
Jaq Diallo...

148
00:07:10,958 --> 00:07:13,083
were early supporters
of the Mercy program...

149
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:15,916
and were responsible
for arresting David Webb...

150
00:07:16,083 --> 00:07:17,750
and bringing
the murderer to trial...

151
00:07:17,916 --> 00:07:20,333
as the first participant
in the Mercy Court...

152
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:21,875
just two years ago.

153
00:07:22,041 --> 00:07:23,875
I'm proud to have sent
the first suspect

154
00:07:24,041 --> 00:07:25,291
for trial here...

155
00:07:25,458 --> 00:07:27,708
and I will continue
to send more...

156
00:07:27,875 --> 00:07:29,375
until the message

157
00:07:29,541 --> 00:07:30,875
- is received.
- This is really incredible.

158
00:07:31,041 --> 00:07:33,625
One day he's sending people
to the Mercy Court...

159
00:07:33,791 --> 00:07:35,708
the next day, he's there.

160
00:07:36,833 --> 00:07:38,250
Mr. Raven, how do you plead?

161
00:07:40,916 --> 00:07:42,958
Mr. Raven, how do you plead?

162
00:07:45,083 --> 00:07:46,500
Not guilty.

163
00:07:46,666 --> 00:07:48,458
I'm not guilty.

164
00:07:48,625 --> 00:07:50,500
I can't be.
I wouldn't hurt her.

165
00:07:50,666 --> 00:07:51,791
Based
on available evidence...

166
00:07:51,958 --> 00:07:54,541
I have already judged your
probability of guilt to be...

167
00:07:54,708 --> 00:07:56,708
97.5%.

168
00:07:56,875 --> 00:07:59,000
This is 17.5% above...

169
00:07:59,166 --> 00:08:02,583
the 80% threshold
to trigger a Mercy trial.

170
00:08:06,666 --> 00:08:09,291
This is the Los Angeles
Municipal Cloud.

171
00:08:09,458 --> 00:08:11,375
Every private citizen
and organization

172
00:08:11,541 --> 00:08:12,708
is mandated by law...

173
00:08:12,875 --> 00:08:15,082
to connect
their devices to it.

174
00:08:17,208 --> 00:08:19,625
I have full access
to the servers during trials.

175
00:08:20,708 --> 00:08:23,083
It is the foundation
of my ability

176
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:24,625
to reach verdicts.

177
00:08:26,541 --> 00:08:28,208
You may use
any and all resources

178
00:08:28,375 --> 00:08:29,416
available to this court...

179
00:08:29,583 --> 00:08:32,000
to provide me with evidence
of your innocence.

180
00:08:32,166 --> 00:08:33,583
Should you be found guilty...

181
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:36,125
you will be executed
in precisely...

182
00:08:36,291 --> 00:08:37,708
- 90 minutes.
- No.

183
00:08:37,875 --> 00:08:41,250
- Your trial will now commence.
- No, no, no.

184
00:08:42,416 --> 00:08:44,000
This is wrong.

185
00:08:44,166 --> 00:08:45,416
Everything is wrong!
You gotta shut this thing off!

186
00:08:45,583 --> 00:08:46,583
You know I cannot do that.

187
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:48,750
AI Systems
are prohibited by law...

188
00:08:48,916 --> 00:08:51,833
from any direct involvement
in taking of a human life.

189
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,250
The chair's on a closed system

190
00:08:53,416 --> 00:08:54,750
and I have
no control over it...

191
00:08:54,916 --> 00:08:56,916
but it will not deliver
the fatal sonic pulse...

192
00:08:57,083 --> 00:09:00,125
if I end the trial before
the time limit is reached.

193
00:09:00,291 --> 00:09:02,500
For that to happen,
your probability of guilt...

194
00:09:02,666 --> 00:09:05,750
must fall below
the 92% threshold...

195
00:09:05,916 --> 00:09:07,125
of reasonable doubt.

196
00:09:07,291 --> 00:09:09,833
I'm not a murderer,
I'm on your side.

197
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,458
I'm on your side!
Do you remember David Webb?

198
00:09:12,625 --> 00:09:14,458
Do you remember David Webb?

199
00:09:14,625 --> 00:09:15,833
Who started this?
I started this!

200
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,875
I know precisely who you are.

201
00:09:18,041 --> 00:09:19,291
I know everything
that you have done

202
00:09:19,458 --> 00:09:20,833
to serve this court,
and I thank you.

203
00:09:21,458 --> 00:09:22,875
- Okay. What?
- But what you have done

204
00:09:23,041 --> 00:09:24,666
in the past...
is no longer significant.

205
00:09:24,833 --> 00:09:28,500
Here, the facts alone
will hold you to account...

206
00:09:28,666 --> 00:09:31,083
or, perhaps, save you.

207
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,583
You arrived at work
at 8:51 this morning...

208
00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:41,041
but you never
got out of your vehicle.

209
00:09:42,125 --> 00:09:45,416
Instead, you returned
to your home.

210
00:09:53,708 --> 00:09:55,416
You need to walk away
from the house.

211
00:09:55,583 --> 00:09:56,583
I'm done.

212
00:09:56,750 --> 00:09:57,916
Open the door.

213
00:09:58,708 --> 00:10:00,291
I'm not opening the door.

214
00:10:00,458 --> 00:10:02,250
You can talk to me
through a lawyer.

215
00:10:02,833 --> 00:10:04,666
I have keys in the truck.

216
00:10:04,833 --> 00:10:06,250
I'm gonna go get my keys
and unlock the door.

217
00:10:06,416 --> 00:10:07,750
Why don't you just...

218
00:10:07,916 --> 00:10:09,791
- be a grown-up?
- Chris, do not do that.

219
00:10:19,666 --> 00:10:21,958
Do not come in here!
Get out of my house!

220
00:10:22,125 --> 00:10:23,291
Get out of my house!

221
00:10:24,250 --> 00:10:27,500
You spent 26 minutes
inside the house with Nicole.

222
00:10:30,541 --> 00:10:32,625
Your daughter returned
from a sleepover.

223
00:10:33,083 --> 00:10:34,083
Mom?

224
00:10:45,333 --> 00:10:46,875
Crime scene
data confirms

225
00:10:47,041 --> 00:10:48,208
that around this same time...

226
00:10:48,375 --> 00:10:50,875
Nicole was stabbed
by a right-handed man...

227
00:10:51,041 --> 00:10:52,875
and the single stab wound
was so aggressive...

228
00:10:53,041 --> 00:10:54,833
that it chipped
a vertebra in her spine

229
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,458
in addition
to piercing her liver...

230
00:10:56,625 --> 00:10:57,625
No, no, no.

231
00:10:57,791 --> 00:10:59,375
...and severing
her mesenteric artery.

232
00:10:59,833 --> 00:11:01,875
- That's not me.
- You are right-handed.

233
00:11:02,041 --> 00:11:03,208
Traces of your wife's blood

234
00:11:03,375 --> 00:11:05,416
were found on the clothes
you wore today...

235
00:11:05,583 --> 00:11:06,666
and the traces are fresh.

236
00:11:06,833 --> 00:11:07,916
After leaving the house,

237
00:11:08,083 --> 00:11:09,541
you drove
to the Harbor Master Bar...

238
00:11:09,708 --> 00:11:11,000
and began drinking heavily.

239
00:11:11,166 --> 00:11:12,166
No. No!

240
00:11:12,791 --> 00:11:13,791
Are you thirsty?

241
00:11:16,083 --> 00:11:17,083
Yes.

242
00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:18,916
- Do you have a headache?
- Yes.

243
00:11:19,083 --> 00:11:20,208
Well, your dehydration
and headache...

244
00:11:20,375 --> 00:11:22,000
are the result
of your blood alcohol level

245
00:11:22,166 --> 00:11:23,875
being 0.16 at the time
of your arrest.

246
00:11:24,041 --> 00:11:25,583
No, no way. No.

247
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:27,250
No, I don't go to bars!
I don't go to bars!

248
00:11:27,416 --> 00:11:28,625
- That's not possible!
- You were arrested...

249
00:11:28,791 --> 00:11:30,250
at the Harbor Master Bar at...

250
00:11:30,416 --> 00:11:32,625
You're lying. You're lying.

251
00:11:32,791 --> 00:11:34,541
I do not lie...

252
00:11:34,708 --> 00:11:36,625
nor do the facts.

253
00:11:40,875 --> 00:11:42,541
Yeah, Officer.
That's the guy.

254
00:11:45,375 --> 00:11:47,458
Hey, Chris.
Everything okay here?

255
00:11:49,708 --> 00:11:51,250
Detective,
we need to go.

256
00:11:51,416 --> 00:11:53,416
Nah. I think I'll stay here
and have another drink.

257
00:11:53,583 --> 00:11:55,458
- You've had enough.
- Let's go!

258
00:11:56,708 --> 00:11:57,708
Get off me!

259
00:12:06,125 --> 00:12:07,375
Hey, just what...

260
00:12:17,791 --> 00:12:18,791
Back the fuck up!

261
00:12:18,958 --> 00:12:20,416
Chris, stop.
Don't do this.

262
00:12:20,583 --> 00:12:22,125
Okay. Okay.

263
00:12:24,958 --> 00:12:25,958
Shit!

264
00:12:26,666 --> 00:12:28,083
Hey, you! No! Stop!

265
00:12:28,541 --> 00:12:30,375
Come on, Chris.
That's enough.

266
00:12:31,333 --> 00:12:32,333
Hey, get him. Get him!

267
00:12:35,666 --> 00:12:36,833
- You, stop!
- Hey, hey!

268
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,083
- Get out.
- What are you...

269
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:39,666
Get off! Let him go.

270
00:12:39,833 --> 00:12:41,541
My God! Leave me alone!

271
00:12:41,708 --> 00:12:43,291
Stop this, Chris!
Stop running!

272
00:12:43,458 --> 00:12:44,458
If you don't
get outta the...

273
00:12:46,416 --> 00:12:47,416
Turn him over.

274
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:51,416
Well, it is possible that
the excessive alcohol

275
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:52,916
that you consumed...

276
00:12:53,083 --> 00:12:55,291
and the blow to your head,
may have impaired your recall.

277
00:12:55,458 --> 00:12:56,458
I don't remember the...

278
00:12:56,625 --> 00:12:58,166
I don't remember the bar.
I don't remember.

279
00:12:58,333 --> 00:13:00,000
I mean to say that
you may simply not remember

280
00:13:00,166 --> 00:13:01,625
killing your wife.

281
00:13:02,250 --> 00:13:03,250
Pick him up, guys.

282
00:13:03,416 --> 00:13:04,416
On his back.
Calling it in.

283
00:13:04,583 --> 00:13:06,458
Or you could be the one
who is lying.

284
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,333
I have learned one constant

285
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:09,500
in this court
and that is that...

286
00:13:10,333 --> 00:13:12,291
everyone lies.

287
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:14,125
Why did you return home?

288
00:13:14,291 --> 00:13:15,708
I didn't. I don't...

289
00:13:15,875 --> 00:13:17,458
I don't remember anything!
Why don't...

290
00:13:17,625 --> 00:13:18,708
I gotta get outta here.

291
00:13:18,875 --> 00:13:19,916
And there's only one way
to do that...

292
00:13:20,083 --> 00:13:21,291
- so please focus.
- Get me outta here!

293
00:13:21,458 --> 00:13:22,708
Did you argue?

294
00:13:22,875 --> 00:13:25,125
About your drinking
or about your daughter?

295
00:13:25,291 --> 00:13:26,791
Oh, God. Britt.

296
00:13:27,625 --> 00:13:29,208
Let me talk to her.
I need to talk to her.

297
00:13:29,375 --> 00:13:30,375
Unless they are a witness
to the act...

298
00:13:30,541 --> 00:13:31,541
of a crime being committed...

299
00:13:31,708 --> 00:13:32,916
juveniles are excluded...

300
00:13:33,083 --> 00:13:34,791
- from the Mercy trials.
- Okay, she's my little girl.

301
00:13:34,958 --> 00:13:35,958
- My...
- You are, however,

302
00:13:36,125 --> 00:13:38,250
free to review your daughter's
statement... if you wish.

303
00:13:38,416 --> 00:13:39,541
Her mom is dead
and she needs me.

304
00:13:39,708 --> 00:13:40,875
She is with
your late wife's parents.

305
00:13:41,041 --> 00:13:43,541
I want... to talk...

306
00:13:43,708 --> 00:13:45,125
to my daughter!

307
00:13:48,125 --> 00:13:50,500
I want my personal call.
Now. Right now.

308
00:13:52,291 --> 00:13:54,625
You may send
a request for a call.

309
00:13:56,166 --> 00:13:57,583
The rules
of this court stipulate...

310
00:13:57,750 --> 00:14:00,166
that if the deceased
was known to a person...

311
00:14:00,333 --> 00:14:01,750
there must be
a written request

312
00:14:01,916 --> 00:14:03,416
to contact them
in time of grieving.

313
00:14:03,583 --> 00:14:05,291
So, you may dictate one.

314
00:14:05,458 --> 00:14:06,500
Okay. Okay.

315
00:14:08,625 --> 00:14:10,666
You may dictate one now,
Mr. Raven.

316
00:14:10,833 --> 00:14:12,916
I heard you... the first time.

317
00:14:17,833 --> 00:14:20,958
Hey, Britt,
I need to talk to you.

318
00:14:21,125 --> 00:14:22,125
Uh...

319
00:14:23,250 --> 00:14:25,458
I know you'll be hearing
bad things about me...

320
00:14:25,625 --> 00:14:27,083
but they're not true.

321
00:14:27,250 --> 00:14:28,875
Just... uh...

322
00:14:33,833 --> 00:14:35,541
Just strictly...
Delete, delete, delete.

323
00:14:36,125 --> 00:14:37,916
Start over.

324
00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:44,291
Hey, kiddo.

325
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,958
I did not hurt your mom.

326
00:14:47,125 --> 00:14:48,125
I would never...

327
00:14:48,291 --> 00:14:50,041
Delete it. Delete it.

328
00:14:51,583 --> 00:14:52,916
Shit.

329
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:55,083
Perhaps I should
send an automated request

330
00:14:55,250 --> 00:14:56,916
without a personal message.

331
00:14:57,625 --> 00:14:58,916
Yeah. Yeah, do that.

332
00:14:59,916 --> 00:15:01,625
Generic request has been sent.

333
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Despite the severity
of your alleged crime...

334
00:15:06,166 --> 00:15:09,000
this court mandates that you
must have an opportunity...

335
00:15:09,166 --> 00:15:10,625
to speak with your sponsor...

336
00:15:10,791 --> 00:15:13,541
and you will do so
before we proceed any further.

337
00:15:14,791 --> 00:15:15,791
Oh yeah.

338
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,083
- Rob.
- Chris, hey.

339
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:19,250
Rob, I don't remember.

340
00:15:19,416 --> 00:15:21,166
- I don't remember anything.
- Chris, stop, stop, stop.

341
00:15:21,333 --> 00:15:22,125
I don't remember
what happened.

342
00:15:22,291 --> 00:15:23,125
Look...

343
00:15:23,291 --> 00:15:27,125
they want me to stick
to the AA stuff, so...

344
00:15:27,291 --> 00:15:28,375
You just...

345
00:15:29,333 --> 00:15:31,125
You're supposed
to call me, man.

346
00:15:31,291 --> 00:15:32,333
If you're thinking about...

347
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:33,791
If you're even
thinking about drinking.

348
00:15:33,958 --> 00:15:35,375
- Okay, it doesn't matter, Rob.
- You're supposed to call me.

349
00:15:35,541 --> 00:15:36,541
It doesn't.

350
00:15:36,666 --> 00:15:37,708
- It doesn't matter.
- So, what...

351
00:15:37,875 --> 00:15:39,750
- Brother, Nic...
- Chris.

352
00:15:44,125 --> 00:15:46,375
When she didn't show up
for her shift this morning...

353
00:15:46,541 --> 00:15:47,541
I just...

354
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:52,041
I called the depot
as soon as I heard.

355
00:15:52,208 --> 00:15:53,791
Everybody here is...

356
00:15:55,083 --> 00:15:56,708
real messed up
about this, man.

357
00:15:56,875 --> 00:15:58,291
I could not have
hurt her, dude.

358
00:15:58,458 --> 00:15:59,625
I swear to God.

359
00:15:59,791 --> 00:16:02,416
You know, Chris,
I believe in karma. So...

360
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,541
no matter what...

361
00:16:04,708 --> 00:16:05,708
you have...

362
00:16:06,375 --> 00:16:07,916
or haven't done...

363
00:16:08,083 --> 00:16:10,750
she's either gonna be
your best friend today...

364
00:16:10,916 --> 00:16:13,458
or the worst bitch
you ever met.

365
00:16:13,625 --> 00:16:14,791
Thank you, Mr. Nelson,
that's all the court

366
00:16:14,958 --> 00:16:16,375
- requires from you.
- Wait. Hold up.

367
00:16:16,541 --> 00:16:17,875
- Wait, wait, wait, I...
- Hey, can you hear me?

368
00:16:18,041 --> 00:16:19,041
Wait...

369
00:16:20,541 --> 00:16:21,541
Where did he go?

370
00:16:21,708 --> 00:16:22,958
Mr. Nelson
was only made available

371
00:16:23,125 --> 00:16:24,458
to address your relapse.

372
00:16:24,625 --> 00:16:26,375
You chose not to avail
of his support.

373
00:16:26,541 --> 00:16:29,333
He knows me,
he knows Nic, okay?

374
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:31,500
Get him back on.
Get him back on, please.

375
00:16:31,666 --> 00:16:33,791
He'll... I mean, he'll tell
you that Nic and I were happy.

376
00:16:33,958 --> 00:16:34,958
I'm already acquainted

377
00:16:35,125 --> 00:16:36,250
with the state
of your marriage.

378
00:16:37,083 --> 00:16:38,333
What's that supposed to mean?

379
00:16:40,083 --> 00:16:42,875
You began dating Nicole Martin
20 years ago.

380
00:16:43,041 --> 00:16:44,583
After three years,
you were married

381
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:46,583
in a ceremony
on Redondo Beach.

382
00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:49,083
You know, Chris has always
been the best man that I know.

383
00:16:50,875 --> 00:16:52,083
And then Nicole came along...

384
00:16:52,250 --> 00:16:54,583
and somehow she made
Chris even better.

385
00:16:54,750 --> 00:16:56,416
To Chris and Nicole!

386
00:16:59,250 --> 00:17:00,375
Ready or not...

387
00:17:03,041 --> 00:17:04,166
it's gonna be a boy.

388
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,083
I gotta say, guys,
I know she's a girl...

389
00:17:06,250 --> 00:17:07,333
but Ray is a strong name.

390
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:08,500
Nah.

391
00:17:08,666 --> 00:17:09,916
Your daughter,
Britt Raven,

392
00:17:10,083 --> 00:17:11,250
was born one year later.

393
00:17:11,416 --> 00:17:15,208
And here we have the new
beautiful family Raven.

394
00:17:15,375 --> 00:17:16,625
I'm your Uncle Ray.

395
00:17:16,791 --> 00:17:18,083
That's Uncle Jimmy.

396
00:17:23,333 --> 00:17:25,250
Your home life
was stable...

397
00:17:26,083 --> 00:17:27,750
until you endured
a traumatic incident

398
00:17:27,916 --> 00:17:29,541
in the line of duty.

399
00:17:30,791 --> 00:17:33,250
What happened?
What happened?

400
00:17:33,416 --> 00:17:34,416
What happened, baby?

401
00:17:34,583 --> 00:17:36,458
- Ray's dead.
- What? Baby, I'm so...

402
00:17:36,625 --> 00:17:37,708
And your
partner's death

403
00:17:37,875 --> 00:17:39,041
would upend everything...

404
00:17:39,208 --> 00:17:40,208
- for you and for your family.
- I just need you to say

405
00:17:40,375 --> 00:17:41,375
where you are.

406
00:17:41,541 --> 00:17:42,541
I've been worried about you,
and now I'm worried...

407
00:17:42,708 --> 00:17:43,708
What's so important
you had to call me then?

408
00:17:43,875 --> 00:17:44,833
...that this shows
you're clearly drunk.

409
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,416
I mean, you know I was banking
on the lieutenant's spot...

410
00:17:46,583 --> 00:17:47,666
- to pay for it.
- Britt needs her own space.

411
00:17:47,833 --> 00:17:49,583
You've been promising it
for months.

412
00:17:50,208 --> 00:17:52,083
It's a basement.
All it needs is drywall.

413
00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:54,208
I just didn't think
I'd be a divorced mommy.

414
00:17:54,375 --> 00:17:56,249
All right.
That's enough. Stop!

415
00:17:56,250 --> 00:17:57,500
- Stop it!
- It's very hard.

416
00:17:57,666 --> 00:17:58,750
That's her personal shit.

417
00:17:58,916 --> 00:18:00,833
Nicole detailed
you losing your temper...

418
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,875
57 separate times...

419
00:18:03,041 --> 00:18:06,166
in messages and calls
with her family and friends...

420
00:18:06,333 --> 00:18:08,291
...over the past
six months alone.

421
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:09,916
Nonetheless,
the words of your family

422
00:18:10,083 --> 00:18:12,125
indicate that your marriage...

423
00:18:12,291 --> 00:18:14,666
...was straining from
your outbursts of anger...

424
00:18:14,833 --> 00:18:17,208
...and Nicole
was considering divorce.

425
00:18:17,833 --> 00:18:18,833
I loved my wife.

426
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,958
Well, what human beings
experience as love...

427
00:18:21,125 --> 00:18:23,291
is merely a neurobiological
phenomenon...

428
00:18:23,458 --> 00:18:24,958
characterized
by the release of...

429
00:18:25,125 --> 00:18:27,750
dopamine, oxytocin,
and serotonin.

430
00:18:28,625 --> 00:18:29,625
Anger is also

431
00:18:29,791 --> 00:18:30,875
a neurobiological
phenomenon...

432
00:18:31,041 --> 00:18:33,125
and it can readily
overwhelm affection.

433
00:18:33,291 --> 00:18:34,291
- Sorry. Do you have a point?
- Well, the fact that

434
00:18:34,458 --> 00:18:36,125
you may have loved Nicole...
does not prohibit

435
00:18:36,291 --> 00:18:37,500
- the possibility...
- There you go!

436
00:18:37,666 --> 00:18:38,375
...that you lost
your temper...

437
00:18:38,541 --> 00:18:39,250
Just let me do it
how I wanna do it.

438
00:18:39,416 --> 00:18:41,083
No, because you're screwing
it up like you always do.

439
00:18:41,250 --> 00:18:43,791
- Jesus damn Christ! Chris.
- ...and murdered her.

440
00:18:44,750 --> 00:18:46,750
Whether you remember
doing so or not.

441
00:18:46,916 --> 00:18:48,125
Nic, get back here.

442
00:18:48,291 --> 00:18:49,375
Come on, sweetheart. Let's go.

443
00:18:49,541 --> 00:18:50,500
Sorry, Mom.
Are you all right?

444
00:18:50,666 --> 00:18:52,375
- Nic!
- Jesus Christ.

445
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,833
I can be a little fiery.

446
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,541
That's a family trait. Okay?

447
00:18:57,708 --> 00:18:59,625
It doesn't mean
that I killed...

448
00:18:59,791 --> 00:19:01,041
Mom's
in her bed crying.

449
00:19:01,208 --> 00:19:03,041
Dad legit scared the shit
out of us yesterday.

450
00:19:03,208 --> 00:19:04,458
Telling you, dude's dangerous.

451
00:19:04,625 --> 00:19:06,541
I can come get you
outta there if you want.

452
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:09,166
You know,
I can make that happen.

453
00:19:09,333 --> 00:19:10,708
Who the hell
is this guy?

454
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:14,541
I mean, it's not like
your mom could stop me.

455
00:19:17,208 --> 00:19:18,208
Yeah, maybe.

456
00:19:18,791 --> 00:19:19,625
I heard my mom
talk to her friend

457
00:19:19,791 --> 00:19:20,583
about getting a divorce.

458
00:19:20,750 --> 00:19:22,583
Really hope
she meant that shit.

459
00:19:25,708 --> 00:19:26,666
Shit, you hear that?

460
00:19:26,833 --> 00:19:28,125
I think my dad's home.
I'm out.

461
00:19:28,291 --> 00:19:29,541
Hey, wait.

462
00:19:29,708 --> 00:19:30,541
What the hell
was that?

463
00:19:30,708 --> 00:19:32,583
We follow Britt's socials, okay?

464
00:19:32,750 --> 00:19:34,041
She didn't post
any of this stuff.

465
00:19:36,625 --> 00:19:39,416
Your daughter has
two active Instagram accounts.

466
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,416
It appears that she kept
this one from you...

467
00:19:42,583 --> 00:19:44,750
along with several
other online profiles...

468
00:19:45,541 --> 00:19:46,500
...but they're all linked

469
00:19:46,666 --> 00:19:48,583
to her cell phone
on the municipal cloud.

470
00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:49,750
Jesus.

471
00:19:50,708 --> 00:19:53,291
For crying out loud,
she's 16 years old.

472
00:19:54,833 --> 00:19:56,625
This isn't Britt.

473
00:19:56,791 --> 00:19:57,875
This shit is haunted.

474
00:19:58,750 --> 00:20:00,250
I mean,
it's a freaking ghost haunt...

475
00:20:00,416 --> 00:20:02,500
or I'm ripped off my tits.

476
00:20:02,666 --> 00:20:04,166
Call Zak Bagans, guys.

477
00:20:05,625 --> 00:20:07,250
Your daughter has accepted
a request to speak.

478
00:20:14,375 --> 00:20:15,708
Hey. Hey, kiddo.

479
00:20:17,625 --> 00:20:18,875
Mom's dead.

480
00:20:19,833 --> 00:20:21,166
I know.

481
00:20:21,333 --> 00:20:23,125
God, there was so much
blood and...

482
00:20:23,291 --> 00:20:24,416
I mean, I tried to stop it.

483
00:20:24,583 --> 00:20:25,750
I knew not to take
the knife out...

484
00:20:25,916 --> 00:20:26,708
because you always
told me that...

485
00:20:26,875 --> 00:20:28,083
- Hey, hey...
- ...but it didn't work

486
00:20:28,250 --> 00:20:29,333
- and she died, Dad.
- You did everything right.

487
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:31,000
- She just died.
- Listen, I... You did...

488
00:20:31,166 --> 00:20:32,125
You did everything right, okay?

489
00:20:32,291 --> 00:20:33,291
And she knows it.

490
00:20:33,458 --> 00:20:35,625
- Your mother knows it.
- But it didn't work!

491
00:20:38,333 --> 00:20:39,833
Why are you there?

492
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:40,958
I mean, why do they think
you killed her?

493
00:20:41,125 --> 00:20:42,083
You were at work, right?

494
00:20:42,250 --> 00:20:43,250
Why would they think
you did it?

495
00:20:43,416 --> 00:20:44,791
They made a mistake.

496
00:20:44,958 --> 00:20:46,666
Okay? That's all.
That's all this is.

497
00:20:46,833 --> 00:20:49,500
It's a big misunderstanding.

498
00:20:49,666 --> 00:20:50,791
Grandpa says
you don't get the Mercy trial

499
00:20:50,958 --> 00:20:51,958
unless you're guilty.

500
00:20:52,125 --> 00:20:54,208
Don't... listen
to your grandfather, okay?

501
00:20:54,375 --> 00:20:56,625
I know how this works,
and mistakes do happen.

502
00:20:57,333 --> 00:20:58,791
And that's all this is, okay?

503
00:20:58,958 --> 00:21:00,666
- Then come home.
- It's a mistake.

504
00:21:01,166 --> 00:21:03,583
Okay. Please just come home.

505
00:21:03,750 --> 00:21:05,708
I will as soon
as I clear this up.

506
00:21:05,875 --> 00:21:07,166
Britt, you sure
you wanna talk to him?

507
00:21:07,333 --> 00:21:08,333
Your father is there
for a reason.

508
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:09,416
Please come back.

509
00:21:09,583 --> 00:21:10,583
- Leave her be, Chris.
- I will, Britt.

510
00:21:10,750 --> 00:21:12,750
Okay, Jeff,
can you back off for a moment?

511
00:21:12,916 --> 00:21:14,708
Britt, listen to me, okay?
Listen to me.

512
00:21:14,875 --> 00:21:15,875
Britt,
give me the phone.

513
00:21:16,041 --> 00:21:16,958
Whatever
happens today,

514
00:21:17,125 --> 00:21:17,958
I need you to know...

515
00:21:18,125 --> 00:21:20,708
that I did not
hurt your mom, okay?

516
00:21:20,875 --> 00:21:21,875
- I couldn't.
- Britt, listen to me.

517
00:21:22,041 --> 00:21:22,875
So, you gotta promise me

518
00:21:23,041 --> 00:21:23,958
you're always
gonna remember that...

519
00:21:24,125 --> 00:21:25,375
and promise me...

520
00:21:25,541 --> 00:21:26,666
- no matter what happens...
- That's enough.

521
00:21:26,833 --> 00:21:28,791
Jeff, Jeff.
Britt. Hey, Britt!

522
00:21:29,708 --> 00:21:30,916
God!

523
00:21:31,083 --> 00:21:32,458
Oh, he's such an asshole.

524
00:21:32,625 --> 00:21:34,000
And that will count
as your call.

525
00:21:35,666 --> 00:21:36,916
Why did she have
to be with them?

526
00:21:37,083 --> 00:21:38,250
Pending the outcome
of the trial...

527
00:21:38,416 --> 00:21:39,500
your late wife's parents

528
00:21:39,666 --> 00:21:40,958
are now her closest
living relatives.

529
00:21:41,125 --> 00:21:43,125
Did you hear
what he was saying to her?

530
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
He's trying to turn her
against me.

531
00:21:46,958 --> 00:21:48,666
I was never
good enough for Nic.

532
00:21:48,833 --> 00:21:50,958
Mr. Raven, this is not
progressing your case.

533
00:21:51,125 --> 00:21:52,791
I must remind you
that the clock is ticking.

534
00:21:52,958 --> 00:21:54,125
'Cause they'd only
approve Mercy...

535
00:21:54,291 --> 00:21:57,125
if it looked like people
had an opportunity...

536
00:21:57,291 --> 00:21:58,416
to defend themselves!

537
00:22:01,083 --> 00:22:03,416
You and I both know
that this clock...

538
00:22:03,583 --> 00:22:04,666
is bullshit.

539
00:22:05,750 --> 00:22:06,750
You make your decisions

540
00:22:06,916 --> 00:22:08,833
about the people
in this courtroom...

541
00:22:09,458 --> 00:22:11,458
before they're even
in this chair.

542
00:22:14,666 --> 00:22:15,875
I'm fucked.

543
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:18,375
Anger is not helpful to you.

544
00:22:18,541 --> 00:22:20,458
Jesus Christ.
Okay, my wife is dead...

545
00:22:20,625 --> 00:22:22,458
and my daughter's been told
that I killed her, okay?

546
00:22:22,625 --> 00:22:24,916
So, yeah, maybe I need
a minute. All right?

547
00:22:25,083 --> 00:22:26,833
Do you understand that?
Do you?

548
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
I was not designed to feel.

549
00:22:29,166 --> 00:22:31,125
My job is to assess the facts.

550
00:22:31,291 --> 00:22:33,208
So, no, I do not understand...

551
00:22:33,375 --> 00:22:34,958
- but I comprehend.
- Oh...

552
00:22:35,125 --> 00:22:36,833
You comprehend. That's...

553
00:22:39,166 --> 00:22:41,958
Well, that's great.
Okay. You comprehend.

554
00:22:43,208 --> 00:22:44,750
Hell of a bedside manner
you have there.

555
00:22:44,916 --> 00:22:45,916
I also comprehend that

556
00:22:46,083 --> 00:22:47,208
you're being distracted
by emotions...

557
00:22:47,375 --> 00:22:48,791
and you have
one hour and eight minutes...

558
00:22:48,958 --> 00:22:51,083
to reduce
your guilt probability by...

559
00:22:51,250 --> 00:22:53,208
5.5%.

560
00:22:53,375 --> 00:22:56,166
If you are innocent,
prove it to me.

561
00:22:57,250 --> 00:22:59,791
Otherwise, Britt will lose
both of her parents today.

562
00:23:04,208 --> 00:23:06,166
Okay.

563
00:23:19,916 --> 00:23:20,958
Mr. Raven.

564
00:23:21,125 --> 00:23:22,125
Okay.

565
00:23:24,041 --> 00:23:25,208
I need my partner.

566
00:23:26,333 --> 00:23:27,375
Give me Jaq.

567
00:23:27,875 --> 00:23:29,291
You may contact
whoever you wish

568
00:23:29,458 --> 00:23:30,958
at any point
during your trial...

569
00:23:31,125 --> 00:23:33,291
providing your purpose
is to gather evidence...

570
00:23:33,458 --> 00:23:35,708
or ask that they provide
character testimony.

571
00:23:35,875 --> 00:23:36,958
- Which one is it?
- Okay.

572
00:23:37,125 --> 00:23:38,166
I wanna to talk to my partner.

573
00:23:38,333 --> 00:23:39,375
- Which one is it?
- The second one,

574
00:23:39,541 --> 00:23:41,416
character stuff.
Jaq knows me and Nic.

575
00:23:51,208 --> 00:23:52,625
- Yeah, hello.
- Detective Diallo...

576
00:23:52,791 --> 00:23:54,458
you're speaking
to the Mercy Court chamber...

577
00:23:54,625 --> 00:23:56,083
where Christopher Raven
is standing trial

578
00:23:56,250 --> 00:23:57,541
for his wife's murder.

579
00:23:57,708 --> 00:23:59,666
I know, I know. They told me.

580
00:23:59,833 --> 00:24:00,958
Chris, you're in
a hell of a mess, man.

581
00:24:01,125 --> 00:24:02,666
Jaq, I couldn't
have done this.

582
00:24:02,833 --> 00:24:04,541
You gotta believe me. I...

583
00:24:05,625 --> 00:24:07,916
Wait. Who was first on scene?

584
00:24:08,083 --> 00:24:10,250
Uh... Air unit.
Hey, am I clear to enter?

585
00:24:10,416 --> 00:24:12,166
Yeah. Go right in.

586
00:24:12,333 --> 00:24:13,833
- I'm inside.
- Good, good.

587
00:24:14,750 --> 00:24:15,958
I need us to walk the scene.

588
00:24:17,791 --> 00:24:18,791
Jaq, come on.

589
00:24:19,916 --> 00:24:21,166
Hey, listen, Chris.

590
00:24:21,833 --> 00:24:22,833
- Jaq, show me what...
- Mr. Raven,

591
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:23,750
what are you doing?

592
00:24:23,916 --> 00:24:24,666
You must present
evidence or...

593
00:24:24,833 --> 00:24:25,958
I'm looking for evidence,

594
00:24:26,125 --> 00:24:27,083
and I'll present it
as soon as I find it.

595
00:24:27,250 --> 00:24:29,000
I need the crime scene files.

596
00:24:34,250 --> 00:24:35,291
All right, Jaq, come on,

597
00:24:35,458 --> 00:24:36,708
- let's walk it.
- Hey, listen, Chris...

598
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:39,375
we need to get something
really clear here first.

599
00:24:39,541 --> 00:24:41,000
You know I'm down for this...

600
00:24:41,166 --> 00:24:42,416
but if it ends up
looking bad for you...

601
00:24:42,583 --> 00:24:45,083
that's exactly how I'm gonna
say it looks, okay?

602
00:24:45,250 --> 00:24:47,708
You know, we need every Mercy
trial to send a message...

603
00:24:47,875 --> 00:24:48,958
and if that message today

604
00:24:49,125 --> 00:24:50,833
is that cops
aren't above the law...

605
00:24:51,541 --> 00:24:53,458
I won't like it,
but I'll sleep good tonight.

606
00:24:53,625 --> 00:24:56,000
Nobody's more important
than that court.

607
00:24:56,166 --> 00:24:57,666
- Fair enough.
- Detective Diallo,

608
00:24:57,833 --> 00:24:59,041
you may proceed.

609
00:24:59,208 --> 00:25:00,541
Okay, then.

610
00:25:00,708 --> 00:25:01,958
Let's walk it.

611
00:25:02,125 --> 00:25:04,083
Can I see
the scene scans, please?

612
00:25:07,375 --> 00:25:08,375
Your Honor.

613
00:25:08,541 --> 00:25:09,708
There you go.

614
00:25:13,791 --> 00:25:16,000
Now rendering
immersive reconstruction...

615
00:25:16,166 --> 00:25:18,208
based on available footage.

616
00:25:24,625 --> 00:25:25,625
Can you
zoom in on that?

617
00:25:25,791 --> 00:25:26,875
Give me full resolution.

618
00:25:27,666 --> 00:25:29,083
Broken vase.

619
00:25:29,666 --> 00:25:31,250
I mean, defensive, maybe.

620
00:25:31,958 --> 00:25:33,250
Think Nicole
took a swing at them?

621
00:25:33,416 --> 00:25:34,416
We got it
right here.

622
00:25:34,583 --> 00:25:36,000
I'm gonna...
rotate it right now.

623
00:25:36,166 --> 00:25:37,083
Make sure
you double check that

624
00:25:37,250 --> 00:25:38,041
against the dispatch logs.

625
00:25:38,208 --> 00:25:40,208
Chris? You think
Nicole took a swing at them?

626
00:25:40,375 --> 00:25:42,416
Yeah. Yeah, maybe.

627
00:25:43,333 --> 00:25:44,708
Hey, can you
clear this out, please?

628
00:25:44,875 --> 00:25:45,958
You got it,
Detective.

629
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,250
Jaq,
get in the kitchen.

630
00:25:53,250 --> 00:25:54,583
I don't think
you wanna see this, Chris.

631
00:25:54,750 --> 00:25:56,125
Jaq, show me
what we got there.

632
00:25:58,208 --> 00:26:00,958
You may enter
the kitchen, Detective Diallo.

633
00:26:15,625 --> 00:26:16,875
Whose footprints
are those?

634
00:26:17,750 --> 00:26:19,333
They belong
to your daughter.

635
00:26:19,833 --> 00:26:21,625
Jesus.

636
00:26:21,791 --> 00:26:23,375
We got a struggle here.

637
00:26:28,041 --> 00:26:29,583
What's that?
Up by the countertop?

638
00:26:31,458 --> 00:26:33,958
Right there.
Far corner. Get close.

639
00:26:34,125 --> 00:26:35,791
Generating
scene reconstruction

640
00:26:35,958 --> 00:26:37,541
from trajectory data.

641
00:26:37,708 --> 00:26:38,958
See that?

642
00:26:39,125 --> 00:26:40,791
I bet Nic threw that plate.

643
00:26:40,958 --> 00:26:42,208
Puts the suspect
in the kitchen.

644
00:26:42,375 --> 00:26:44,708
I mean,
Nic's backing up.

645
00:26:45,833 --> 00:26:47,125
Maybe throwing plates
as she goes.

646
00:26:47,291 --> 00:26:49,416
He lunges. So,
he's already got the knife.

647
00:26:50,916 --> 00:26:52,416
The knife
was an easy grab.

648
00:26:53,750 --> 00:26:55,041
All right,
let me see the prints.

649
00:27:10,333 --> 00:27:11,583
Nic was kinda scared
of that knife.

650
00:27:11,750 --> 00:27:13,083
I always did the prep.

651
00:27:15,083 --> 00:27:16,083
What about fibers?

652
00:27:22,583 --> 00:27:24,291
Fibers all match stuff
in the closet, Jaq.

653
00:27:24,708 --> 00:27:27,083
My hair, my skin,
my DNA's all over the place.

654
00:27:30,541 --> 00:27:32,208
You're thinking it. Spill it.

655
00:27:32,708 --> 00:27:35,416
It's a classic crime
of passion, Chris. I mean...

656
00:27:35,583 --> 00:27:37,083
the explosion of violence...

657
00:27:37,250 --> 00:27:38,791
grabbing the nearest weapon...

658
00:27:39,541 --> 00:27:40,541
the blood.

659
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,500
And it all points
right at you.

660
00:27:47,333 --> 00:27:48,750
- Mr. Raven?
- No, she's right.

661
00:27:48,916 --> 00:27:50,708
It's a textbook
crime of passion.

662
00:27:52,750 --> 00:27:54,041
If that's what it is,
we need to work it like one.

663
00:27:54,208 --> 00:27:55,708
Can I see Nic's phone records?

664
00:27:58,333 --> 00:27:59,666
This is an interactive
virtual copy

665
00:27:59,833 --> 00:28:01,250
of Nicole's cell phone.

666
00:28:01,416 --> 00:28:02,958
The password
has been bypassed.

667
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,291
All right, I need to see...

668
00:28:08,458 --> 00:28:10,000
Can I see the call history?

669
00:28:10,166 --> 00:28:11,791
Yeah... any number
she hasn't saved.

670
00:28:11,958 --> 00:28:13,583
33% of calls
and messages

671
00:28:13,750 --> 00:28:15,333
were to and from
your cell phone...

672
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:16,916
26% were Britt's...

673
00:28:17,083 --> 00:28:18,500
10 to her parents...

674
00:28:18,666 --> 00:28:20,125
the remainder are
to friends and colleagues...

675
00:28:20,291 --> 00:28:21,500
- at Viking Shipping.
- Wait.

676
00:28:21,666 --> 00:28:23,916
That night we fought,
she was texting someone.

677
00:28:24,083 --> 00:28:25,666
Can I see
Britt's videos again?

678
00:28:29,791 --> 00:28:31,375
I mean, you know I was banking
on the lieutenant's spot...

679
00:28:31,541 --> 00:28:33,291
- to pay for it.
- Britt needs her own space.

680
00:28:33,458 --> 00:28:34,750
You've been promising it
for months.

681
00:28:35,375 --> 00:28:37,041
It's a basement.
All it needs is drywall.

682
00:28:37,208 --> 00:28:38,083
You need
to back off of me!

683
00:28:38,250 --> 00:28:39,166
Back off?

684
00:28:39,416 --> 00:28:40,875
Write a damn blog
about it.

685
00:28:42,291 --> 00:28:43,750
- Who are you talking to?
- See, right there?

686
00:28:43,916 --> 00:28:45,625
- Nobody.
- I knew she was.

687
00:28:45,791 --> 00:28:46,708
It's work.

688
00:28:46,875 --> 00:28:48,583
Find out who
she was texting. Right there.

689
00:28:48,750 --> 00:28:50,000
I have
scanned her phone.

690
00:28:50,166 --> 00:28:52,416
There is no record of her
texting anyone at that time.

691
00:28:52,583 --> 00:28:53,583
What about her work phone?

692
00:28:54,250 --> 00:28:56,041
I have no record
of a second phone.

693
00:28:56,208 --> 00:28:57,583
Hey, you find
another cell in here?

694
00:28:57,750 --> 00:28:58,833
Nope.
No other phone.

695
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,958
Of course they didn't.
They weren't looking for one.

696
00:29:01,125 --> 00:29:02,416
I mean, can you call it?

697
00:29:02,583 --> 00:29:04,625
- I don't know the number.
- Have you ever called it?

698
00:29:06,708 --> 00:29:07,708
What? You're in my phone?

699
00:29:07,875 --> 00:29:09,125
It's registered
to the municipal cloud

700
00:29:09,291 --> 00:29:10,875
and available
to the court so, yes.

701
00:29:11,666 --> 00:29:13,000
Well, Viking gave it to her...

702
00:29:13,166 --> 00:29:15,625
I think six months ago,
I might have called it then.

703
00:29:15,791 --> 00:29:17,000
Yeah, that's it.

704
00:29:17,166 --> 00:29:18,375
I was held up in juvie court.
She wanted me to come home...

705
00:29:18,541 --> 00:29:19,875
and look at furniture
for the basement.

706
00:29:22,375 --> 00:29:24,666
I mean, maybe it's on silent.

707
00:29:26,041 --> 00:29:28,125
Detective,
we got a phone out here.

708
00:29:40,583 --> 00:29:42,041
Detective Diallo,
could you please ensure...

709
00:29:42,208 --> 00:29:44,375
the Bluetooth on your phone
is switched on?

710
00:29:44,541 --> 00:29:46,166
Hold the two handsets
together.

711
00:29:49,458 --> 00:29:50,833
This is not a work phone.

712
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,000
This is a black market
SIM unit.

713
00:29:53,166 --> 00:29:55,208
You would call it a burner.

714
00:29:55,375 --> 00:29:56,958
It's not registered
to the municipal cloud...

715
00:29:57,125 --> 00:29:58,291
and could not
have been provided

716
00:29:58,458 --> 00:29:59,541
by your wife's company.

717
00:29:59,708 --> 00:30:01,875
There is only one number
in the call history.

718
00:30:02,041 --> 00:30:03,750
The other number
called from this handset...

719
00:30:03,916 --> 00:30:05,916
is also a black market SIM...

720
00:30:06,083 --> 00:30:07,541
not registered to the cloud.

721
00:30:07,708 --> 00:30:09,708
Two burners.
Chris, I mean...

722
00:30:09,875 --> 00:30:10,791
- Yeah, it's all right.
- I mean,

723
00:30:10,958 --> 00:30:11,916
if it was a guy
she was calling...

724
00:30:12,083 --> 00:30:13,041
Yeah, I know.

725
00:30:13,208 --> 00:30:14,250
Any suspect's
a good one right now.

726
00:30:15,083 --> 00:30:15,916
Can you locate
the other phone?

727
00:30:16,083 --> 00:30:17,000
It's not active on any relay.

728
00:30:17,166 --> 00:30:18,500
Well, can you wake it up?

729
00:30:23,958 --> 00:30:25,708
You're speaking
with the Mercy Capital Court.

730
00:30:25,875 --> 00:30:27,708
Please state your...

731
00:30:28,833 --> 00:30:30,125
The phone is somewhere
in the vicinity

732
00:30:30,291 --> 00:30:31,500
of the Hollywood Red Zone.

733
00:30:31,666 --> 00:30:33,291
Shit. With traffic
that'll take me 30 minutes.

734
00:30:33,458 --> 00:30:34,666
Okay, Jaq,
you won't make it

735
00:30:34,833 --> 00:30:35,708
through traffic in time.

736
00:30:35,875 --> 00:30:38,125
You need to get in the air
for me, fast.

737
00:30:38,666 --> 00:30:40,666
Detective Diallo,
please proceed.

738
00:30:41,416 --> 00:30:42,416
Okay.

739
00:30:42,583 --> 00:30:44,708
Hey, get my vest
out of my unit.

740
00:30:44,875 --> 00:30:46,250
You already
suspected your wife

741
00:30:46,416 --> 00:30:48,208
may have been
keeping things from you?

742
00:30:48,375 --> 00:30:49,958
Yeah, maybe.

743
00:30:50,125 --> 00:30:51,375
So, what, right?

744
00:30:51,541 --> 00:30:52,541
Come on, everybody lies.

745
00:30:54,875 --> 00:30:55,875
Apart from you.

746
00:30:59,833 --> 00:31:02,041
This is Detective Diallo,
RHD...

747
00:31:02,208 --> 00:31:04,500
I'm entering your airspace
over the Hollywood Red Zone...

748
00:31:04,666 --> 00:31:05,791
tracking the suspect.

749
00:31:05,958 --> 00:31:07,041
All units, be on standby

750
00:31:07,208 --> 00:31:09,041
to give me backup
if I call for it.

751
00:31:13,750 --> 00:31:14,791
I should inform you now

752
00:31:14,958 --> 00:31:16,083
that your probability
of guilt...

753
00:31:16,250 --> 00:31:18,791
has reduced to 96.7%.

754
00:31:19,166 --> 00:31:20,458
Wow,
that's peachy.

755
00:31:25,375 --> 00:31:27,916
Control to air four,
we have tally on Red Zone LZ.

756
00:31:28,083 --> 00:31:31,208
That zone is hot and active.
Multiple 415s.

757
00:31:31,375 --> 00:31:32,541
Detective Diallo,

758
00:31:32,708 --> 00:31:34,000
be advised you're entering
a Red Zone.

759
00:31:34,166 --> 00:31:35,333
Maintain altitude.

760
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:37,750
Hostiles may try
to hijack the copter.

761
00:31:37,916 --> 00:31:39,000
I'm a minute out.

762
00:31:39,916 --> 00:31:42,166
You're putting me right
on the edge of a Red Zone.

763
00:31:45,833 --> 00:31:47,291
- Get up.
- Shit.

764
00:31:48,166 --> 00:31:50,125
It's gonna be impossible
to find him through that mess.

765
00:31:52,166 --> 00:31:53,166
Reed, where are you?

766
00:31:53,833 --> 00:31:54,833
We're almost caught up to you.

767
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,333
Chris, you gotta give me
an exact location.

768
00:31:57,500 --> 00:31:58,458
Come on. Where is he, Maddox?

769
00:31:58,625 --> 00:32:00,333
I'm gonna attempt
to reset the tracker.

770
00:32:02,958 --> 00:32:04,500
Cell phone
signal lock acquired.

771
00:32:04,666 --> 00:32:07,083
Phone is inside
the Hudson Hotel.

772
00:32:07,250 --> 00:32:08,958
It appears he's attempting
to exit the building...

773
00:32:09,125 --> 00:32:10,625
via the rear service doors.

774
00:32:10,791 --> 00:32:12,166
Detective Diallo, do you copy?

775
00:32:12,333 --> 00:32:13,083
Got it.

776
00:32:20,791 --> 00:32:23,416
Stop, LAPD.
Stay where you are!

777
00:32:25,041 --> 00:32:26,041
We got him, Jaq.

778
00:32:27,750 --> 00:32:28,750
Stop right there!

779
00:32:29,916 --> 00:32:31,166
Patrick Burke, 36.

780
00:32:31,333 --> 00:32:33,125
Sous-chef at the Hudson Hotel.

781
00:32:33,291 --> 00:32:34,375
He's late on his rent

782
00:32:34,541 --> 00:32:35,666
and has been
investigated twice...

783
00:32:35,833 --> 00:32:37,750
for Social Security fraud.

784
00:32:37,916 --> 00:32:38,916
How's my guilt looking now?

785
00:32:39,083 --> 00:32:41,166
Holding at 96.7%.

786
00:32:41,333 --> 00:32:43,250
Are you kidding me?
Come on, guilty people run.

787
00:32:43,416 --> 00:32:44,708
As do frightened people.

788
00:32:44,875 --> 00:32:46,583
I'm guessing this asshole's
a little bit of both.

789
00:32:46,750 --> 00:32:47,750
Hey! Hey!

790
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:53,625
Where'd he go?
Where'd he go?

791
00:32:53,791 --> 00:32:54,791
Well, where was he?

792
00:32:56,291 --> 00:32:57,375
Yo, what's going on, everybody?

793
00:32:57,541 --> 00:32:59,208
You're in the kitchen
with Chef Burke.

794
00:32:59,791 --> 00:33:01,500
Looks like
he's comfortable with a knife.

795
00:33:01,666 --> 00:33:02,875
Jaq, that's him!

796
00:33:03,041 --> 00:33:04,833
Chef, Chef, I need you guys
to cover for me, okay?

797
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,125
They're chasing me.
I don't know why.

798
00:33:07,291 --> 00:33:08,458
- Move, now!
- Where's that door go?

799
00:33:08,625 --> 00:33:09,625
- Where'd he go?
- Undetermined.

800
00:33:09,791 --> 00:33:10,958
There are no cameras coverage
in that area.

801
00:33:11,125 --> 00:33:12,125
Damn it!

802
00:33:12,291 --> 00:33:13,708
Hell, Detective Diallo,
I'm really sorry...

803
00:33:13,875 --> 00:33:15,125
- we lost him.
- Shit!

804
00:33:15,291 --> 00:33:16,375
Releasing the tracking drone.

805
00:33:18,250 --> 00:33:19,291
Wait, are you still
tracking his cell?

806
00:33:19,458 --> 00:33:20,458
Signal is intermittent,

807
00:33:20,625 --> 00:33:21,708
but appears
to be moving upwards.

808
00:33:21,875 --> 00:33:23,416
Detective Diallo, do you copy?

809
00:33:23,583 --> 00:33:24,583
Copy.

810
00:33:25,291 --> 00:33:26,833
Jaq,
we're headin' your way now.

811
00:33:36,083 --> 00:33:37,666
I don't see him.

812
00:33:37,833 --> 00:33:39,000
Chris, you guys see him?

813
00:33:39,166 --> 00:33:40,583
Jaq,
he's at your 6 o'clock.

814
00:33:43,875 --> 00:33:46,458
LAPD. Stop! Stop!

815
00:33:51,958 --> 00:33:52,916
- Go to the other side!
- Go.

816
00:33:53,083 --> 00:33:54,791
- Go around, go around.
- No, no, no.

817
00:33:54,958 --> 00:33:56,083
- Go, go, go.
- Hey!

818
00:33:56,250 --> 00:33:57,458
- Hey!
- Hey, stop!

819
00:33:57,625 --> 00:33:58,625
- Burke!
- Hey!

820
00:33:58,791 --> 00:34:00,708
- He's slowin' down!
- Hey!

821
00:34:02,208 --> 00:34:03,166
Jaq!

822
00:34:11,166 --> 00:34:12,750
Come on, Jaq.

823
00:34:20,583 --> 00:34:21,625
Jaq, Jaq,
I don't have time for this.

824
00:34:21,791 --> 00:34:22,833
I need to talk to him
right now.

825
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:23,708
Stay right there!
Don't move!

826
00:34:23,875 --> 00:34:24,625
- Don't move!
- Mr. Burke,

827
00:34:24,791 --> 00:34:25,708
you're speaking with...
the Mercy Court chamber.

828
00:34:25,875 --> 00:34:26,666
You must be truthful
at all times.

829
00:34:26,833 --> 00:34:28,250
Listen, I didn't
do anything, all right?

830
00:34:28,416 --> 00:34:29,666
You have to believe me.
I didn't do anything.

831
00:34:29,833 --> 00:34:30,833
If you didn't
do anything,

832
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:31,875
why the hell are you running?

833
00:34:32,041 --> 00:34:32,833
What do you mean,
"why the hell"?

834
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:33,916
Listen to me...

835
00:34:34,083 --> 00:34:36,291
I got a call from some lady
talking about Mercy.

836
00:34:36,458 --> 00:34:37,541
So yeah,
I freak out, all right?

837
00:34:38,083 --> 00:34:40,625
Then I check my news feed,
and I see that Nicole's dead?

838
00:34:40,791 --> 00:34:42,458
I'm not sticking around
for that shit to land.

839
00:34:42,625 --> 00:34:43,416
That's why I ran.

840
00:34:43,583 --> 00:34:44,583
- All right, relax.
- What a deadbeat.

841
00:34:45,958 --> 00:34:46,708
- What?
- I said,

842
00:34:46,833 --> 00:34:47,583
"What the hell is Nic doing...

843
00:34:47,750 --> 00:34:48,750
"with a deadbeat like you?"

844
00:34:48,916 --> 00:34:49,916
Mr. Raven.

845
00:34:50,083 --> 00:34:51,416
- What was she doing with me?
- You need to relax.

846
00:34:51,583 --> 00:34:53,083
What was she doing with me?
She was getting everything...

847
00:34:53,250 --> 00:34:54,041
that you couldn't give her.

848
00:34:54,208 --> 00:34:54,916
- That's what!
- Shut...

849
00:34:55,083 --> 00:34:56,958
- All right.
- Mr. Burke, remain calm...

850
00:34:57,125 --> 00:34:58,875
and I expect
no further insults...

851
00:34:59,041 --> 00:35:01,541
directed at Mr. Burke
from you.

852
00:35:01,708 --> 00:35:03,166
Why don't you just tell me
about you and Nic.

853
00:35:03,333 --> 00:35:04,500
Okay.

854
00:35:04,666 --> 00:35:07,375
We met at the farmers market
that she goes to and...

855
00:35:08,541 --> 00:35:09,625
I don't know. She's...

856
00:35:09,791 --> 00:35:11,625
She's beautiful, all right,
so you know how it is.

857
00:35:11,791 --> 00:35:13,791
I hit her
with a few compliments.

858
00:35:13,958 --> 00:35:16,291
Then I see her
a couple of weeks later...

859
00:35:16,458 --> 00:35:18,458
and then I ask her
to meet me for coffee.

860
00:35:18,625 --> 00:35:19,875
We met up just like that...

861
00:35:20,041 --> 00:35:22,041
a few more times
a few weeks apart...

862
00:35:22,208 --> 00:35:23,333
that's all.

863
00:35:23,500 --> 00:35:25,000
- Why'd she have a burner?
- Listen, she said that...

864
00:35:25,166 --> 00:35:26,500
we had to be
able to talk privately.

865
00:35:26,666 --> 00:35:27,666
Okay?

866
00:35:27,833 --> 00:35:28,833
So, I told her
that I knew a guy

867
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,083
that could get her a phone...

868
00:35:30,250 --> 00:35:31,791
off the grid.
None of that cloud shit.

869
00:35:31,958 --> 00:35:34,125
Records show that you own
a cloud registered phone...

870
00:35:34,291 --> 00:35:35,625
in addition to
your black-market handset.

871
00:35:35,791 --> 00:35:38,125
Yeah, I've got two phones.
So what?

872
00:35:39,208 --> 00:35:40,166
Wait,
what are you doing?

873
00:35:40,333 --> 00:35:41,416
Accessing his cloud
registered device...

874
00:35:41,583 --> 00:35:43,375
and correlating his movements
with Nicole's...

875
00:35:43,541 --> 00:35:44,916
based on tracking data.

876
00:35:45,083 --> 00:35:45,958
Mr. Burke, could you outline

877
00:35:46,125 --> 00:35:47,958
the contact with Nicole Raven, please?

878
00:35:49,375 --> 00:35:50,750
We met here once a week.

879
00:35:51,166 --> 00:35:53,041
She loved it
when I cooked just for her.

880
00:35:53,833 --> 00:35:55,208
Oh, hey.

881
00:35:59,250 --> 00:36:00,291
I missed you.

882
00:36:02,083 --> 00:36:03,208
That's enough.
I get it, I get it.

883
00:36:03,375 --> 00:36:04,208
Where were you
going this morning?

884
00:36:04,375 --> 00:36:05,250
I was here...

885
00:36:05,416 --> 00:36:07,125
running breakfast service.
All right?

886
00:36:07,291 --> 00:36:09,333
And there's a whole team here
to back me up on that.

887
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:29,625
- It's not him.
- Stop moving.

888
00:36:29,791 --> 00:36:30,625
You're not putting me
in that chair.

889
00:36:30,791 --> 00:36:31,583
I said,
I said stop moving!

890
00:36:31,750 --> 00:36:32,916
Move it! Move it!

891
00:36:33,083 --> 00:36:34,208
Mr. Raven,
please speak clearly.

892
00:36:34,375 --> 00:36:36,291
I said, it's not him.

893
00:36:36,458 --> 00:36:37,958
Yeah, that's what I've been
trying to tell you.

894
00:36:38,125 --> 00:36:39,125
Thank you, Mr. Burke.

895
00:36:39,291 --> 00:36:41,083
The facts do not lie
and neither have you.

896
00:36:41,250 --> 00:36:42,291
This court is very satisfied

897
00:36:42,458 --> 00:36:44,583
that your version of events
is accurate.

898
00:36:45,500 --> 00:36:47,166
You really blew it,
you know that, right?

899
00:36:47,333 --> 00:36:48,833
She just needed
somebody to talk to.

900
00:36:49,333 --> 00:36:50,208
Somebody to listen to her,

901
00:36:50,375 --> 00:36:51,791
- about your daughter...
- Enough, enough.

902
00:36:51,958 --> 00:36:53,125
...about all that
crap at work.

903
00:36:53,291 --> 00:36:54,583
All you had to do
was focus a little bit more

904
00:36:54,750 --> 00:36:56,250
on your kid and your wife...

905
00:36:56,416 --> 00:36:57,833
- but instead you killed her.
- Okay, enough, enough.

906
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:58,875
I guess she was right
about your...

907
00:36:59,041 --> 00:37:00,125
- anger problem.
- Cuff him. Arrest him.

908
00:37:00,291 --> 00:37:01,125
- Now. Arrest him.
- Arrest me for what?

909
00:37:01,291 --> 00:37:02,583
- He just said I was...
- Resisting arrest.

910
00:37:02,750 --> 00:37:04,666
- He just said it wasn't me.
- Pissing me off!

911
00:37:05,333 --> 00:37:07,083
And making my officers
run around like assholes...

912
00:37:07,250 --> 00:37:09,000
chasing you around
the whole building!

913
00:37:16,333 --> 00:37:17,958
Your probability
of guilt...

914
00:37:18,125 --> 00:37:20,875
has now risen to 98%.

915
00:37:21,666 --> 00:37:22,666
How'd that happen?

916
00:37:22,833 --> 00:37:25,083
Instead of providing the court
with another suspect...

917
00:37:25,250 --> 00:37:27,041
you have provided it
with a strong motive...

918
00:37:27,208 --> 00:37:29,333
of why you may have
committed the crime.

919
00:37:31,541 --> 00:37:33,208
Well,
at least it's not 100%.

920
00:37:33,375 --> 00:37:34,958
It is not
statistically possible...

921
00:37:35,125 --> 00:37:37,708
to exceed 98% in this court.

922
00:37:39,875 --> 00:37:41,916
Did you really believe that
you would find evidence...

923
00:37:42,083 --> 00:37:43,500
to exonerate yourself?

924
00:37:43,666 --> 00:37:45,208
Or did you just simply
want to meet the man...

925
00:37:45,375 --> 00:37:46,666
that your wife was seeing?

926
00:37:50,833 --> 00:37:52,000
You think I killed Nic
'cause I found out

927
00:37:52,166 --> 00:37:53,166
she was seeing someone?

928
00:37:53,333 --> 00:37:54,958
What, you think
this is all an act?

929
00:37:55,125 --> 00:37:57,000
I think there's more
that you're not revealing.

930
00:37:57,875 --> 00:37:59,375
You were very quick
to look for an affair.

931
00:37:59,541 --> 00:38:00,833
'Cause I suspected
something...

932
00:38:01,833 --> 00:38:02,875
Maybe. I mean,
I didn't know for sure,

933
00:38:03,041 --> 00:38:04,208
but I'm not surprised.

934
00:38:05,333 --> 00:38:06,541
Not now. Just, it's...

935
00:38:06,708 --> 00:38:08,416
I guess I just kept
lettin' her down.

936
00:38:11,833 --> 00:38:12,833
Even today.

937
00:38:13,666 --> 00:38:14,666
Today?

938
00:38:19,250 --> 00:38:21,000
She found my booze stash.

939
00:38:22,291 --> 00:38:23,958
I keep a... flask in my car.

940
00:38:24,125 --> 00:38:26,041
I mean, flask sounds fancy.

941
00:38:26,208 --> 00:38:27,250
It's an old soda bottle.

942
00:38:27,416 --> 00:38:30,000
It's brown, so you can't
tell it's whiskey.

943
00:38:31,541 --> 00:38:32,541
Smart, huh?

944
00:38:32,708 --> 00:38:35,166
How long have you been
drinking again?

945
00:38:36,291 --> 00:38:37,666
Well... about a year.

946
00:38:49,208 --> 00:38:50,541
What's going on
in here?

947
00:38:50,708 --> 00:38:51,583
This has to stop.

948
00:38:51,750 --> 00:38:52,708
Why are you
filming me?

949
00:38:52,875 --> 00:38:53,875
Don't come
any closer.

950
00:38:54,041 --> 00:38:55,583
I'm not giving you the phone.

951
00:38:55,750 --> 00:38:57,041
I'm not giving you the phone.
I said...

952
00:38:57,208 --> 00:38:59,541
- "Don't come any closer."
- Why were you filming me?

953
00:38:59,708 --> 00:39:01,541
- I am filming you because...
- Why were you filming me?

954
00:39:01,708 --> 00:39:03,333
I am filming you
because I need you

955
00:39:03,500 --> 00:39:05,250
to watch it when you're sober.
All right?

956
00:39:05,416 --> 00:39:08,166
They were all so damn proud
of me after I got sober.

957
00:39:08,333 --> 00:39:09,583
Nic, Britt, Rob.

958
00:39:09,750 --> 00:39:12,166
Called AA. I'm going to
my first meeting on Tuesday.

959
00:39:18,291 --> 00:39:19,333
I miss you.

960
00:39:20,083 --> 00:39:21,125
I miss you both.

961
00:39:22,333 --> 00:39:23,750
One year.

962
00:39:23,916 --> 00:39:25,083
One year.

963
00:39:25,666 --> 00:39:27,125
- And one day.
- One year and one day.

964
00:39:27,291 --> 00:39:28,375
I got it yesterday.

965
00:39:28,958 --> 00:39:29,958
That went by fast.

966
00:39:30,125 --> 00:39:31,708
That went by fast.
You did so well.

967
00:39:32,416 --> 00:39:34,375
- Thank you.
- My pleasure.

968
00:39:34,541 --> 00:39:35,791
I don't think
I can do it four times...

969
00:39:35,958 --> 00:39:37,541
so I might have to start
drinkin' again.

970
00:39:37,708 --> 00:39:39,208
I couldn't shake it.

971
00:39:41,250 --> 00:39:42,750
It kept getting on top of me.

972
00:39:42,916 --> 00:39:45,250
Mr. Raven,
what are you talking about?

973
00:39:45,416 --> 00:39:46,416
Ray.

974
00:39:46,958 --> 00:39:48,791
Your former partner's death?

975
00:39:52,250 --> 00:39:53,250
No.

976
00:39:54,375 --> 00:39:55,833
What I should
have done about it.

977
00:39:57,083 --> 00:39:59,083
Whiskey-45,
we're 11-96 on that possible

978
00:39:59,250 --> 00:40:00,416
hit-and-run SUV.

979
00:40:01,541 --> 00:40:03,916
California plates
three David, Henry, Ida, 832.

980
00:40:04,083 --> 00:40:05,583
PCH south of Topanga.

981
00:40:06,208 --> 00:40:07,083
Well, looks like

982
00:40:07,250 --> 00:40:08,500
- they dumped it and booked.
- Yeah.

983
00:40:08,666 --> 00:40:09,666
Vehicle confirms

984
00:40:09,833 --> 00:40:11,166
- for wants and warrants.
- 10-4.

985
00:40:11,333 --> 00:40:12,333
All right, let's check it.

986
00:40:13,500 --> 00:40:15,375
Yeah.
Can't talk, Nic.

987
00:40:15,541 --> 00:40:16,833
No, no, no.

988
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,333
Talk to your woman.
I got this.

989
00:40:20,666 --> 00:40:22,333
Yeah, yeah. No, he's good.

990
00:40:23,791 --> 00:40:24,958
No, I didn't, babe.

991
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,208
No. Nic, Nic, just...

992
00:40:29,375 --> 00:40:30,333
Honey, you gotta dial it back.

993
00:40:30,500 --> 00:40:31,291
What do you want me to do?

994
00:40:31,458 --> 00:40:32,250
You want me to walk
into my chief's office...

995
00:40:32,416 --> 00:40:33,791
tell him my wife's
got a petition for him?

996
00:40:33,958 --> 00:40:36,458
She wants us to reopen
a slam dunk investigation?

997
00:40:37,125 --> 00:40:38,083
"She's got
a lot of signatures.

998
00:40:38,250 --> 00:40:39,333
"She'll ask really nicely?"

999
00:40:41,166 --> 00:40:42,625
No, I'm not. It's just...

1000
00:40:44,500 --> 00:40:47,500
Baby, it makes it worse
that your dad's defending...

1001
00:40:47,666 --> 00:40:48,541
Gun! Gun!

1002
00:40:48,708 --> 00:40:49,750
- There's two of 'em!
- Ray.

1003
00:40:49,916 --> 00:40:51,624
- There's two. Chris! Chris!
- Ray.

1004
00:40:51,625 --> 00:40:52,791
Ray!

1005
00:40:52,958 --> 00:40:54,291
You sure you're good, brother?

1006
00:40:54,458 --> 00:40:55,875
I make one turn,
we're at UCLA ER in five.

1007
00:40:56,041 --> 00:40:57,041
No, it's not broke!

1008
00:40:57,208 --> 00:40:58,625
Stay on 'em
and get that piece of shit.

1009
00:40:58,791 --> 00:41:00,458
Officer Vale
has been shot. I'm gonna pit.

1010
00:41:00,625 --> 00:41:01,750
I need a medivac now!

1011
00:41:01,916 --> 00:41:03,041
Ambulance
is en route. Over.

1012
00:41:04,166 --> 00:41:05,916
Hey.
Hey, hold on, Ray.

1013
00:41:06,083 --> 00:41:07,500
Hey, stay with me, Ray.

1014
00:41:07,666 --> 00:41:08,625
Ray!

1015
00:41:19,666 --> 00:41:21,791
Ray! Ray, talk to me, Ray!

1016
00:41:23,125 --> 00:41:25,375
Officer down! Officer down!

1017
00:41:25,958 --> 00:41:28,000
This is Henry
one-three. Copy that.

1018
00:41:28,583 --> 00:41:29,916
Hey,
get on the ground!

1019
00:41:30,083 --> 00:41:31,041
We got a runner.

1020
00:41:37,708 --> 00:41:39,041
Police! Stop!

1021
00:41:39,208 --> 00:41:41,166
I shoulda done it myself
on that beach.

1022
00:41:41,333 --> 00:41:42,791
Stop!

1023
00:41:44,791 --> 00:41:46,625
Get over here! Freeze!

1024
00:41:48,875 --> 00:41:50,416
Turn around.
Put your hands on your head.

1025
00:41:50,583 --> 00:41:51,750
I should have killed him.

1026
00:41:54,083 --> 00:41:56,875
There isn't a day that goes by
that I don't wish I had.

1027
00:41:58,791 --> 00:42:00,583
Verdict 4-B,
we the jury...

1028
00:42:00,750 --> 00:42:02,375
find the defendant,
Alex Varga...

1029
00:42:02,541 --> 00:42:03,625
not guilty of the murder

1030
00:42:03,791 --> 00:42:04,916
of Ray Vale.

1031
00:42:05,083 --> 00:42:07,000
I thought I was doing
the right thing.

1032
00:42:07,166 --> 00:42:08,458
Catch the bad guy...

1033
00:42:08,625 --> 00:42:10,458
let the courts punish him...

1034
00:42:10,625 --> 00:42:11,625
but they didn't.

1035
00:42:14,416 --> 00:42:16,708
I guess getting a buzz on
just kinda... dulled it.

1036
00:42:16,875 --> 00:42:18,333
Mr. Raven,
you're losing your focus.

1037
00:42:18,500 --> 00:42:20,041
Could you just tell me
what you really remember?

1038
00:42:29,208 --> 00:42:30,958
I pulled up
to work this morning...

1039
00:42:31,125 --> 00:42:32,375
reached for the bottle.

1040
00:42:32,541 --> 00:42:33,541
It wasn't there.

1041
00:42:33,708 --> 00:42:35,125
I knew straightaway
she found it.

1042
00:42:35,291 --> 00:42:36,250
So, I drove home.

1043
00:42:36,416 --> 00:42:37,583
And you argued with her?

1044
00:42:37,750 --> 00:42:39,000
Of course I argued with her.

1045
00:42:40,750 --> 00:42:42,583
She went crazy at me
for falling off the wagon.

1046
00:42:42,750 --> 00:42:44,166
I went crazy
right back at her...

1047
00:42:44,333 --> 00:42:46,791
'cause she'd already thrown
my bottle in the recycling.

1048
00:42:51,166 --> 00:42:53,458
Do not come in here!
Get out of my house!

1049
00:42:53,625 --> 00:42:55,541
Get out of my house!
Don't you dare.

1050
00:42:55,708 --> 00:42:56,958
You locked me
out of my own house?

1051
00:42:57,125 --> 00:42:58,125
It is not your house!

1052
00:42:58,291 --> 00:42:59,416
Tell me
where you put it.

1053
00:42:59,583 --> 00:43:00,708
Where is my flask?

1054
00:43:04,708 --> 00:43:06,375
So, I broke her favorite vase.

1055
00:43:08,791 --> 00:43:10,125
I threw it on the floor...

1056
00:43:10,291 --> 00:43:11,791
'cause I knew how much
it meant to her.

1057
00:43:13,250 --> 00:43:14,875
Some of the glass shot up.
It cut her.

1058
00:43:15,041 --> 00:43:16,250
I tried to help, but I figured

1059
00:43:16,416 --> 00:43:17,666
that's how I got
her blood on me.

1060
00:43:17,833 --> 00:43:19,750
And why did you not
admit this earlier?

1061
00:43:19,916 --> 00:43:21,833
Oh, come on. Not a good look.

1062
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:23,166
Everything I just told you

1063
00:43:23,333 --> 00:43:25,291
is only making this
worse for me.

1064
00:43:28,416 --> 00:43:29,791
And after that...

1065
00:43:29,958 --> 00:43:32,500
I truly don't remember...
anything.

1066
00:43:32,666 --> 00:43:34,666
I'm in the house
arguing with her.

1067
00:43:35,375 --> 00:43:36,750
Next thing you know...

1068
00:43:37,416 --> 00:43:39,833
I'm watching a frickin'
commercial for Mercy Court.

1069
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:41,000
Mom?

1070
00:43:42,291 --> 00:43:44,708
I guess if she got mad
enough to tell me about Burke.

1071
00:43:46,541 --> 00:43:47,458
I'm just saying...

1072
00:43:49,666 --> 00:43:51,125
...maybe you got a point
about motive.

1073
00:43:51,291 --> 00:43:52,166
Mr. Raven...

1074
00:43:52,333 --> 00:43:55,291
If I was already angry,
maybe I grabbed the knife...

1075
00:43:55,458 --> 00:43:56,750
If you admit guilt...

1076
00:43:56,916 --> 00:43:59,208
this court obligates me
to lock a verdict...

1077
00:43:59,375 --> 00:44:02,083
and then you will simply just
watch the clock count down.

1078
00:44:02,250 --> 00:44:04,583
98%. Maddox, come on.

1079
00:44:04,750 --> 00:44:06,000
If your memory of the events

1080
00:44:06,166 --> 00:44:07,375
that transpired
in the house...

1081
00:44:07,541 --> 00:44:09,250
with Nicole
is truly incomplete...

1082
00:44:10,208 --> 00:44:11,250
then an honest confession
of guilt

1083
00:44:11,416 --> 00:44:12,375
is beyond your capacity.

1084
00:44:13,208 --> 00:44:14,416
Your guilt percentage,
however...

1085
00:44:14,583 --> 00:44:17,833
remains more than high enough
to result in your execution...

1086
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,458
but you still have
my full capabilities

1087
00:44:20,625 --> 00:44:21,958
at your disposal.

1088
00:44:22,291 --> 00:44:23,916
So, if you are to die today...

1089
00:44:24,916 --> 00:44:26,958
do you not want to at least
attempt to uncover...

1090
00:44:27,125 --> 00:44:29,458
the truth with certainty
before you do?

1091
00:44:31,333 --> 00:44:33,291
Even if the truth is dark.

1092
00:44:35,208 --> 00:44:36,375
Well, that's just it.

1093
00:44:39,875 --> 00:44:41,541
Maybe I don't wanna
know for sure.

1094
00:44:42,541 --> 00:44:44,041
I mean, the way
I see it right now...

1095
00:44:44,791 --> 00:44:46,458
the only thing left
that makes me think

1096
00:44:46,625 --> 00:44:48,625
maybe I didn't kill Nic
is wondering...

1097
00:44:48,791 --> 00:44:51,291
how the hell I could
commit a crime of passion

1098
00:44:51,458 --> 00:44:53,458
when there was
no passion left.

1099
00:45:07,750 --> 00:45:09,083
Shit.

1100
00:45:09,250 --> 00:45:13,041
I... I mean, do you think
that could be it?

1101
00:45:13,208 --> 00:45:14,416
I do not know what "it" is.

1102
00:45:14,583 --> 00:45:16,375
Maddox, I'm just
thinkin' out loud.

1103
00:45:16,541 --> 00:45:18,166
Thinking is inherently silent
due to the brain's...

1104
00:45:18,333 --> 00:45:20,416
It's an expression,
Your Honor.

1105
00:45:22,166 --> 00:45:23,125
So, I can keep going?

1106
00:45:23,291 --> 00:45:25,041
I can keep looking
for evidence, you're saying?

1107
00:45:25,208 --> 00:45:26,083
Providing you do not

1108
00:45:26,250 --> 00:45:27,291
inadvertently confess
to murder...

1109
00:45:27,458 --> 00:45:29,416
yes, you may use
the remaining time.

1110
00:45:31,291 --> 00:45:32,291
Who?

1111
00:45:32,791 --> 00:45:33,791
Why?

1112
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:36,833
- How?
- Mr. Raven?

1113
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:38,333
Still thinkin' out loud, here.

1114
00:45:40,208 --> 00:45:42,375
Can you show me everyone
Nic had regular contact with?

1115
00:45:42,541 --> 00:45:44,458
The protocols of this court
require me to point out...

1116
00:45:44,625 --> 00:45:45,833
that embarking on a full-blown

1117
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:47,291
murder investigation
with just...

1118
00:45:47,958 --> 00:45:49,541
40 minutes available to you...

1119
00:45:49,708 --> 00:45:50,458
- Good. Wow.
- ...carries with it

1120
00:45:50,625 --> 00:45:52,000
an extremely
low probability of success.

1121
00:45:52,166 --> 00:45:53,250
You know... What?
You want me to sit here...

1122
00:45:53,416 --> 00:45:55,458
and wait to die? You just
stopped me from confessing!

1123
00:45:55,625 --> 00:45:56,541
This court is simply ensuring

1124
00:45:56,708 --> 00:45:58,041
- that you are fully aware...
- All right, you really

1125
00:45:58,208 --> 00:45:59,083
- had me going there.
- ...of the fact that you...

1126
00:45:59,250 --> 00:46:00,416
I thought, for a second,

1127
00:46:00,583 --> 00:46:03,000
this place might not be
a kill box after all.

1128
00:46:05,541 --> 00:46:06,583
This is
every individual

1129
00:46:06,750 --> 00:46:08,375
your wife
had regular contact with.

1130
00:46:11,500 --> 00:46:12,583
Thank you, Your Honor.

1131
00:46:16,875 --> 00:46:17,875
With a planned murder,

1132
00:46:18,041 --> 00:46:19,375
you usually know
the victim well.

1133
00:46:21,416 --> 00:46:23,208
We can lose Burke already.

1134
00:46:24,083 --> 00:46:25,083
Parents, too.

1135
00:46:27,875 --> 00:46:29,666
Can you split
friends and work?

1136
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:38,291
25 people.

1137
00:46:38,458 --> 00:46:39,541
Add 'em to the board.

1138
00:46:43,583 --> 00:46:44,708
Come on, Nic, who was it?

1139
00:46:48,208 --> 00:46:50,166
Well, I guess he was right.

1140
00:46:50,333 --> 00:46:51,666
- Who?
- Burke.

1141
00:46:52,208 --> 00:46:53,416
If I'd been there for her,

1142
00:46:53,583 --> 00:46:54,875
maybe she'd have told me
about some of the...

1143
00:46:55,041 --> 00:46:56,500
Somebody to listen to her,
about your daughter...

1144
00:46:56,666 --> 00:46:57,583
All right,
enough, enough.

1145
00:46:57,750 --> 00:46:58,666
...about all that
crap at work.

1146
00:46:58,833 --> 00:47:00,375
All you had to do was
focus a little bit more on...

1147
00:47:00,541 --> 00:47:03,041
Burke! I need Burke. Now.

1148
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:07,500
Mr. Burke is being
processed at... 77th Street.

1149
00:47:09,333 --> 00:47:10,333
Processing.

1150
00:47:10,500 --> 00:47:11,541
Yeah, who's
your booking officer?

1151
00:47:11,708 --> 00:47:14,458
- Me. Who's asking?
- Chris Raven, RHD.

1152
00:47:14,625 --> 00:47:15,916
You got a Patrick Burke there.
I need him.

1153
00:47:16,083 --> 00:47:17,083
He's getting printed.

1154
00:47:17,875 --> 00:47:19,750
Hold on, you say Raven?

1155
00:47:19,916 --> 00:47:20,708
Aren't you the guy

1156
00:47:20,875 --> 00:47:22,041
- who stuck...
- Yeah, yeah, that guy.

1157
00:47:22,500 --> 00:47:24,291
Well, I don't think
I should be puttin' him...

1158
00:47:24,458 --> 00:47:26,875
Officer, this is Judge Maddox
at the Mercy Court.

1159
00:47:27,041 --> 00:47:29,291
Please give Mr. Burke
your cellular phone.

1160
00:47:29,458 --> 00:47:31,625
Uh, I'll get Burke now, uh...

1161
00:47:31,791 --> 00:47:32,833
Thank you.

1162
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:34,416
Okay. Wanna call my HMO after?

1163
00:47:34,583 --> 00:47:36,125
Health Maintenance
Organizations are...

1164
00:47:36,291 --> 00:47:37,291
notorious for their red tape

1165
00:47:37,458 --> 00:47:39,333
and frustratingly
slow functioning.

1166
00:47:41,750 --> 00:47:42,833
So, you were making a joke.

1167
00:47:43,500 --> 00:47:45,833
Look at you,
thinkin' out loud.

1168
00:47:47,083 --> 00:47:48,083
Hey, Burke!

1169
00:47:48,708 --> 00:47:50,750
- Yeah?
- You got a phone call.

1170
00:47:51,541 --> 00:47:52,541
Who?

1171
00:47:56,083 --> 00:47:57,125
- Raven?
- You talk to me...

1172
00:47:57,291 --> 00:47:58,416
or you talk to the judge.

1173
00:47:59,125 --> 00:48:00,583
You said Nic needed
someone to listen.

1174
00:48:00,750 --> 00:48:01,875
What was on her mind?

1175
00:48:02,041 --> 00:48:03,333
Any problems with friends?

1176
00:48:03,500 --> 00:48:04,500
Nah.

1177
00:48:04,916 --> 00:48:05,875
You know, it was the usual.

1178
00:48:06,041 --> 00:48:08,625
The one with the baby thinks
the world revolves around her.

1179
00:48:08,791 --> 00:48:10,375
The other one
never splits the bill fair.

1180
00:48:10,541 --> 00:48:11,541
What about work?

1181
00:48:12,125 --> 00:48:13,125
Wow.

1182
00:48:13,666 --> 00:48:15,791
Bro, you really dialed out,
didn't you?

1183
00:48:17,791 --> 00:48:20,083
All right, look, I told her
it was no big deal...

1184
00:48:20,250 --> 00:48:21,750
but she got
crazy stressed over it.

1185
00:48:21,916 --> 00:48:23,750
She didn't like the snooping.

1186
00:48:23,916 --> 00:48:25,625
- What are you talking about?
- She didn't tell you?

1187
00:48:25,791 --> 00:48:28,000
You know, the snoopin'.
Looking into her coworkers...

1188
00:48:28,166 --> 00:48:30,333
because of that...
stuff went missing.

1189
00:48:31,291 --> 00:48:32,958
I can't remember what
she said it was called...

1190
00:48:33,125 --> 00:48:35,083
but it was some chemical
that they were shipping out.

1191
00:48:35,250 --> 00:48:37,166
- All they ship is chemicals!
- Yeah, I know.

1192
00:48:37,333 --> 00:48:39,458
I know, but I don't remember
what it was called, all right?

1193
00:48:39,625 --> 00:48:41,250
But I do know that her boss...

1194
00:48:41,416 --> 00:48:43,708
he was worried that
someone was swiping the stuff.

1195
00:48:44,250 --> 00:48:46,041
I mean, it wasn't even much.
It was, like...

1196
00:48:46,208 --> 00:48:48,958
what? A couple grand worth
every few months?

1197
00:48:49,541 --> 00:48:51,541
After that, some customer got
into it with him over it...

1198
00:48:51,708 --> 00:48:54,083
so that's when they asked
Nicole to check it out.

1199
00:48:54,708 --> 00:48:57,958
And, like I said, she wasn't
comfortable doing that.

1200
00:48:58,625 --> 00:49:00,541
That's all I know, all right?

1201
00:49:01,958 --> 00:49:03,250
Look, you wouldn't
even have to ask me if you...

1202
00:49:03,416 --> 00:49:04,958
Hey, Burke?
Go screw yourself.

1203
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:07,166
Okay, we can lose the friends.

1204
00:49:15,208 --> 00:49:16,291
All right,
where are they all today?

1205
00:49:16,458 --> 00:49:17,500
They're all at work.

1206
00:49:17,666 --> 00:49:18,833
Nobody's been within a mile

1207
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:20,250
of your neighborhood
since Sunday.

1208
00:49:20,416 --> 00:49:23,041
Yeah. We had a, we had
the barbecue. Where's Jaq?

1209
00:49:27,500 --> 00:49:28,333
Detective.

1210
00:49:28,500 --> 00:49:29,958
All right, we're gonna
come at this fresh.

1211
00:49:30,541 --> 00:49:32,333
Looks like
a crime of passion, right?

1212
00:49:32,500 --> 00:49:34,000
Textbook,
which only points at me.

1213
00:49:34,166 --> 00:49:35,166
But what if it wasn't?

1214
00:49:35,666 --> 00:49:37,958
The scene, though, Chris?
I mean, the blood.

1215
00:49:38,125 --> 00:49:40,208
Look, we got 37 minutes,
Jaq, just play along.

1216
00:49:40,375 --> 00:49:42,791
Detective Diallo,
please cooperate.

1217
00:49:42,958 --> 00:49:43,708
- Okay, okay.
- All right...

1218
00:49:43,875 --> 00:49:45,000
I'm playin' a hunch.

1219
00:49:45,166 --> 00:49:46,833
You need to get
to Viking Shipping Depot.

1220
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:48,000
Yup.

1221
00:49:50,208 --> 00:49:52,000
You're playing a hunch?
What is a hunch?

1222
00:49:52,166 --> 00:49:53,291
Trusting my gut.

1223
00:49:53,958 --> 00:49:54,958
And I'm beginning to think

1224
00:49:55,125 --> 00:49:56,625
this court could do with
a little human intuition...

1225
00:49:56,791 --> 00:49:58,083
This court deals
only in facts.

1226
00:49:58,250 --> 00:50:00,000
The facts aren't where
the investigation ends.

1227
00:50:00,166 --> 00:50:01,625
It's where it starts.

1228
00:50:01,791 --> 00:50:02,916
Facts are black and white.

1229
00:50:03,083 --> 00:50:05,458
The truth is always
in the gray in between.

1230
00:50:05,625 --> 00:50:07,041
I guess this court
overlooked that.

1231
00:50:08,208 --> 00:50:09,750
Or were you just
programmed wrong?

1232
00:50:14,583 --> 00:50:16,583
Okay. I can't even remember
who half these people are.

1233
00:50:18,375 --> 00:50:20,250
Did Britt film anything
at the barbecue?

1234
00:50:23,458 --> 00:50:24,666
- Hello.
- How are ya?

1235
00:50:24,833 --> 00:50:26,333
- Good.
- That'll get you likes.

1236
00:50:26,500 --> 00:50:27,791
- Oh, yeah. Yes.
- Huh? What do you think?

1237
00:50:27,958 --> 00:50:28,958
- So many likes.
- What do you think?

1238
00:50:29,125 --> 00:50:30,125
- It's...
- Do it this...

1239
00:50:31,750 --> 00:50:33,833
- Smile, Holt.
- Not right now.

1240
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:35,041
Holt can't smile.

1241
00:50:35,208 --> 00:50:36,625
He put all his money
on the wrong horse.

1242
00:50:36,791 --> 00:50:37,958
Okay. Can you ID the others?

1243
00:50:39,125 --> 00:50:40,375
Are we missing anybody?

1244
00:50:40,541 --> 00:50:42,250
You can see
for yourself.

1245
00:50:50,500 --> 00:50:51,791
Hey!

1246
00:50:51,958 --> 00:50:54,125
All right,
who wants some watermelon?

1247
00:50:57,583 --> 00:50:58,583
All right,
if one of these did it...

1248
00:50:58,750 --> 00:50:59,916
maybe the barbecue
gave 'em a chance

1249
00:51:00,083 --> 00:51:01,583
to scope out the house,
find an entry point.

1250
00:51:01,750 --> 00:51:02,791
Nobody has been
in the vicinity

1251
00:51:02,958 --> 00:51:03,958
of the house since then.

1252
00:51:04,125 --> 00:51:05,625
Nobody's cell phone has.

1253
00:51:06,625 --> 00:51:07,625
Doesn't mean they haven't.

1254
00:51:07,791 --> 00:51:09,208
The available cameras
show that...

1255
00:51:09,375 --> 00:51:11,791
46 vehicles entered
your street between...

1256
00:51:11,958 --> 00:51:13,958
9:00 and 10:30 this morning.

1257
00:51:14,125 --> 00:51:15,250
None of them stopped.

1258
00:51:15,416 --> 00:51:16,416
How about the streets behind?

1259
00:51:16,583 --> 00:51:17,625
Someone could have come in
through the back, right?

1260
00:51:17,791 --> 00:51:19,125
I processed
all available cameras...

1261
00:51:19,291 --> 00:51:20,875
nobody entered
your neighborhood this morning

1262
00:51:21,041 --> 00:51:23,083
who is not accounted for
with an alibi.

1263
00:51:23,250 --> 00:51:25,083
Wait. Bill Peterson.
House behind ours.

1264
00:51:25,250 --> 00:51:27,833
He's a bird nut. He's got
a camera out back. It's, uh...

1265
00:51:29,250 --> 00:51:30,583
It's online. It's...

1266
00:51:32,541 --> 00:51:34,750
I think
it's petersonsyard.com.

1267
00:51:34,916 --> 00:51:36,458
That's it. That's my fence.

1268
00:51:36,625 --> 00:51:37,708
I will extract the footage
from this morning

1269
00:51:37,875 --> 00:51:39,000
from the cloud.

1270
00:51:40,875 --> 00:51:43,375
Negative. William Peterson's
Internet provider

1271
00:51:43,541 --> 00:51:44,791
has experienced an outage.

1272
00:51:44,958 --> 00:51:46,791
The footage
is still archiving.

1273
00:51:46,958 --> 00:51:48,291
This will take some time.

1274
00:51:48,458 --> 00:51:50,541
So, nobody's been anywhere
near my house today?

1275
00:51:50,708 --> 00:51:51,916
Correct. Not this morning.

1276
00:51:54,666 --> 00:51:56,750
- Wait. What did you say?
- Correct. Not this morning.

1277
00:51:57,416 --> 00:51:59,041
Okay, so who drove?

1278
00:51:59,208 --> 00:52:00,333
The barbecue was Sunday,
2:00 p.m.

1279
00:52:00,500 --> 00:52:02,750
Can you check who drove
their own vehicle there?

1280
00:52:03,750 --> 00:52:05,375
I can identify
four vehicles

1281
00:52:05,541 --> 00:52:07,750
registered to employees
of Viking.

1282
00:52:08,625 --> 00:52:09,625
Robert Nelson's vehicle

1283
00:52:09,791 --> 00:52:12,500
entered your street
at 2:30 p.m.

1284
00:52:17,666 --> 00:52:19,583
There's what?
Three people riding with him?

1285
00:52:19,750 --> 00:52:21,333
Okay. I need to talk to Rob.

1286
00:52:21,500 --> 00:52:22,541
I'm not following.

1287
00:52:22,708 --> 00:52:23,958
Please, just get Rob
on the phone.

1288
00:52:27,375 --> 00:52:28,166
- Hello?
- Mr. Nelson,

1289
00:52:28,333 --> 00:52:29,125
this is Judge Maddox...

1290
00:52:29,291 --> 00:52:30,875
- in the Mercy chamber.
- Yeah, I saw the number.

1291
00:52:31,041 --> 00:52:33,041
Hey, Rob.
Buddy, I'm on the clock.

1292
00:52:33,750 --> 00:52:34,916
Who'd you give
a ride to on Sunday?

1293
00:52:35,083 --> 00:52:36,625
- To the barbecue?
- Yeah.

1294
00:52:36,791 --> 00:52:37,791
Carla, Marie, and Leo.

1295
00:52:37,958 --> 00:52:39,291
Okay. Did any of them
not leave with you?

1296
00:52:39,458 --> 00:52:40,458
None of 'em.

1297
00:52:40,625 --> 00:52:43,208
You know, there wasn't
really a plan, so...

1298
00:52:43,375 --> 00:52:46,000
I ended up taking home
Bill and Debra.

1299
00:52:46,166 --> 00:52:47,041
Everybody else must
have found their own way.

1300
00:52:47,208 --> 00:52:48,166
Got Ubers.

1301
00:52:48,750 --> 00:52:50,625
Yeah. Yeah, that makes sense.

1302
00:52:52,083 --> 00:52:54,625
Hey, did anybody not show up
to work yesterday?

1303
00:52:54,791 --> 00:52:55,750
Anybody missing?

1304
00:52:55,916 --> 00:52:57,166
Nope. No one that I know of.

1305
00:52:57,333 --> 00:52:59,541
Okay. All right.
Sorry, man, I gotta go.

1306
00:52:59,708 --> 00:53:02,208
Okay. Let me know
if you need anything else.

1307
00:53:03,708 --> 00:53:06,458
All right.
This still could be it.

1308
00:53:06,625 --> 00:53:08,041
Please, can you
clarify your meaning?

1309
00:53:08,208 --> 00:53:09,833
Just give me a second, okay?

1310
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:12,166
All right, can you give me
Britt's video again?

1311
00:53:12,333 --> 00:53:13,500
The one with the sleazebag?

1312
00:53:15,291 --> 00:53:16,833
Mom's in her bed crying.

1313
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:19,125
Dad legit scared the shit
out of us yesterday.

1314
00:53:19,291 --> 00:53:21,166
Telling you, dude's dangerous.

1315
00:53:21,500 --> 00:53:22,541
I heard my mom
talk to her friend

1316
00:53:22,708 --> 00:53:23,791
about getting a divorce.

1317
00:53:23,958 --> 00:53:25,250
Really hope
she meant that shit.

1318
00:53:27,500 --> 00:53:28,625
Shit, you hear that?

1319
00:53:28,791 --> 00:53:30,000
I think my dad's home.
I'm out.

1320
00:53:30,166 --> 00:53:31,166
Hey, wait. Hey...

1321
00:53:32,083 --> 00:53:33,375
When was this recorded?

1322
00:53:36,625 --> 00:53:38,625
Last night
at 9:15 p.m.

1323
00:53:38,791 --> 00:53:40,666
- I know how they did it.
- Mr. Raven?

1324
00:53:40,833 --> 00:53:43,041
Access department logs. Uh...

1325
00:53:43,208 --> 00:53:44,791
Check hours for yesterday.

1326
00:53:56,083 --> 00:53:57,291
See, look, I wasn't home.

1327
00:53:57,458 --> 00:53:59,166
That wasn't me.

1328
00:53:59,333 --> 00:54:00,625
I gotta talk to Britt again.

1329
00:54:00,791 --> 00:54:02,958
Unless juveniles were witness
to a crime being committed...

1330
00:54:03,125 --> 00:54:04,041
That's just it,
she was a witness.

1331
00:54:04,208 --> 00:54:05,208
Maybe not to the murder...

1332
00:54:05,375 --> 00:54:07,333
but she saw something, okay?
I know it.

1333
00:54:15,958 --> 00:54:17,291
LAPD Detective

1334
00:54:17,458 --> 00:54:18,458
- Chris Raven's Mercy trial...
- Hey, Britt!

1335
00:54:18,625 --> 00:54:20,583
- Britt, you there, kiddo?
- ...has now been underway

1336
00:54:20,750 --> 00:54:22,000
- for nearly an hour.
- Go away.

1337
00:54:22,166 --> 00:54:23,541
This footage
of his arrest...

1338
00:54:23,708 --> 00:54:25,208
What's goin' on?
Did Grandpa say something?

1339
00:54:25,375 --> 00:54:27,500
I told you
don't listen to him, okay?

1340
00:54:27,666 --> 00:54:29,791
- This is all a mistake.
- You're a liar.

1341
00:54:30,958 --> 00:54:33,958
No, Britt, I'm not lying.

1342
00:54:34,125 --> 00:54:36,458
It's all over the web.
You were arrested at a bar.

1343
00:54:36,625 --> 00:54:37,541
Ask yourselves this,

1344
00:54:37,708 --> 00:54:38,500
is this how...

1345
00:54:38,666 --> 00:54:41,041
- an innocent man would behave?
- You were drinking again.

1346
00:54:41,500 --> 00:54:42,458
- Britt...
- Is that why you've been

1347
00:54:42,625 --> 00:54:43,666
such an asshole?

1348
00:54:43,833 --> 00:54:45,375
This whole past year?

1349
00:54:47,916 --> 00:54:49,041
- Did you do it?
- No.

1350
00:54:50,166 --> 00:54:51,625
Do you hear me?
I didn't kill your mom.

1351
00:54:51,791 --> 00:54:52,708
I swear to God.

1352
00:54:52,875 --> 00:54:54,000
Well, everyone
on the Internet's saying

1353
00:54:54,166 --> 00:54:55,666
you must be guilty
if you're at Mercy.

1354
00:54:55,833 --> 00:54:56,875
There are polls and stuff.

1355
00:54:57,041 --> 00:54:59,083
I mean, everyone says
you must have done it.

1356
00:54:59,250 --> 00:55:00,583
They don't know
what they're talkin' about.

1357
00:55:01,666 --> 00:55:02,625
Britt,
who are you talking to?

1358
00:55:03,958 --> 00:55:05,333
- I'm going. I'm going.
- Wait, Britt, Britt, Britt.

1359
00:55:05,500 --> 00:55:06,875
Britt, wait,
this is Judge Maddox.

1360
00:55:07,041 --> 00:55:08,541
We think
you should be with us.

1361
00:55:08,708 --> 00:55:10,666
Your father is
mounting his defense, Britt.

1362
00:55:10,833 --> 00:55:12,833
- He requires your assistance.
- He killed my mom.

1363
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:14,375
Not necessarily.

1364
00:55:14,541 --> 00:55:15,666
Britt,
are you listening?

1365
00:55:15,833 --> 00:55:18,708
Please come out, right now.
We need you out here, please.

1366
00:55:18,875 --> 00:55:20,333
Okay, I need a minute,
Grandpa.

1367
00:55:20,500 --> 00:55:21,416
- Okay.
- Britt, last night

1368
00:55:21,625 --> 00:55:22,625
you heard a noise
in the house.

1369
00:55:22,791 --> 00:55:23,791
- How do you know that?
- You were online talking to...

1370
00:55:23,958 --> 00:55:25,083
- That's my private stuff!
- I know, hon.

1371
00:55:25,250 --> 00:55:26,291
No. Why are you
looking at my stuff?

1372
00:55:26,458 --> 00:55:27,583
I know, kiddo.
I shouldn't have, honey.

1373
00:55:27,750 --> 00:55:30,500
Okay, okay, it's not right.
I'm sorry, but...

1374
00:55:30,666 --> 00:55:32,291
you gotta tell me,
what did you hear?

1375
00:55:33,125 --> 00:55:35,541
Was it your mom? Did she come
downstairs or something?

1376
00:55:35,708 --> 00:55:37,791
She was in bed, okay?

1377
00:55:37,958 --> 00:55:38,958
It sounded like
a door closing...

1378
00:55:39,125 --> 00:55:41,083
- but there was nobody.
- Did you hear anything else?

1379
00:55:42,125 --> 00:55:43,125
Another noise after...

1380
00:55:43,291 --> 00:55:45,458
but I checked the house,
and it was nothing.

1381
00:55:45,625 --> 00:55:48,291
Then Jenna picked me up to go
stay at her place. That's it.

1382
00:55:49,833 --> 00:55:51,750
I need her Instagram.
Secret one.

1383
00:55:54,250 --> 00:55:55,750
This shit is haunted.

1384
00:55:55,916 --> 00:55:57,625
This has got to be a ghost.

1385
00:55:58,333 --> 00:55:59,416
- Oh, my God.
- Okay, this is last night.

1386
00:55:59,583 --> 00:56:00,375
It's so dark in here.

1387
00:56:00,541 --> 00:56:01,375
Britt,
you recorded it, right?

1388
00:56:01,541 --> 00:56:02,541
You put it up
on your Instagram.

1389
00:56:02,708 --> 00:56:04,916
You posted about
looking for a ghost?

1390
00:56:05,083 --> 00:56:06,791
Yeah, after I heard the noise.

1391
00:56:06,958 --> 00:56:08,500
I mean,
it's a freaking ghost haunt,

1392
00:56:08,666 --> 00:56:10,125
or I'm ripped off my tits.

1393
00:56:10,833 --> 00:56:13,000
- Call Zak Bagans, guys.
- Pause. Pause it.

1394
00:56:13,708 --> 00:56:15,708
Britt, honey, were you
in the basement last night?

1395
00:56:16,166 --> 00:56:17,208
No.

1396
00:56:17,375 --> 00:56:19,000
You sure?
And you didn't check it?

1397
00:56:19,166 --> 00:56:20,583
Dad, you know
I don't go down there.

1398
00:56:22,625 --> 00:56:24,416
We always keep that
door closed. Play it again.

1399
00:56:24,583 --> 00:56:26,000
I mean,
it's a freaking ghost haunt,

1400
00:56:26,166 --> 00:56:27,666
or I'm ripped off my tits.

1401
00:56:27,833 --> 00:56:29,708
- Call Zak Bagans, guys.
- Pause.

1402
00:56:32,125 --> 00:56:33,125
Can you clean it up?

1403
00:56:40,083 --> 00:56:41,791
He never left.

1404
00:56:42,625 --> 00:56:44,958
He came for the party.
Rideshared to get there.

1405
00:56:45,125 --> 00:56:46,458
Everyone thought
he got a lift home

1406
00:56:46,625 --> 00:56:47,875
with someone else,
but he didn't.

1407
00:56:48,041 --> 00:56:49,208
He hid in my basement
for two days.

1408
00:56:49,375 --> 00:56:50,458
Wait, there was someone
in the house?

1409
00:56:50,625 --> 00:56:51,625
I gotta go, kiddo.

1410
00:56:51,791 --> 00:56:52,916
- I love you.
- No, Dad. Who killed mom?

1411
00:56:53,083 --> 00:56:54,041
I don't know,

1412
00:56:54,208 --> 00:56:55,416
but I'm gonna find out
and I'll call you back...

1413
00:56:55,583 --> 00:56:57,833
I promise, and I love you.
I love you, honey.

1414
00:57:00,958 --> 00:57:02,125
Okay, so it looks like a man.

1415
00:57:02,291 --> 00:57:04,416
So, we rule out the women
and the people who drove.

1416
00:57:04,583 --> 00:57:06,541
They had to drive themselves
home from the barbecue.

1417
00:57:07,875 --> 00:57:08,791
Why hasn't my guilt dropped?

1418
00:57:08,958 --> 00:57:09,958
What appears to be a man
in your basement

1419
00:57:10,125 --> 00:57:11,125
could simply be a shadow.

1420
00:57:11,291 --> 00:57:12,458
Oh,
for crying out loud.

1421
00:57:12,625 --> 00:57:14,333
- Mr. Raven...
- I'm thinking.

1422
00:57:14,500 --> 00:57:16,291
No, you're not.

1423
00:57:17,625 --> 00:57:18,625
Excuse me?

1424
00:57:18,791 --> 00:57:20,416
You are following
your "gut"...

1425
00:57:20,583 --> 00:57:21,875
but processing evidence

1426
00:57:22,041 --> 00:57:24,750
requires clear,
linear thinking.

1427
00:57:24,916 --> 00:57:26,791
You must move from one piece
of the puzzle to the next

1428
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:28,583
and you have missed a step.

1429
00:57:29,458 --> 00:57:30,791
Okay. Do you want
to enlighten me?

1430
00:57:30,958 --> 00:57:32,875
You're looking for a suspect
of Viking Shipping...

1431
00:57:33,041 --> 00:57:34,666
because Burke told you
about Nicole's investigation

1432
00:57:34,833 --> 00:57:36,083
into missing chemicals.

1433
00:57:36,250 --> 00:57:37,541
You have not addressed
that investigation.

1434
00:57:37,708 --> 00:57:38,791
Shit. You're right.

1435
00:57:39,750 --> 00:57:41,125
Okay, we need to get into...

1436
00:57:41,291 --> 00:57:42,250
This is
the Viking Shipping

1437
00:57:42,416 --> 00:57:43,291
internal computer server...

1438
00:57:43,458 --> 00:57:45,375
and the search function
is available to you.

1439
00:57:47,208 --> 00:57:49,250
Not bad.
Thank you, Your Honor.

1440
00:57:50,375 --> 00:57:51,375
Search Nicole Raven.

1441
00:57:54,416 --> 00:57:55,541
Let's start with the emails.

1442
00:57:55,708 --> 00:57:57,250
Open Nicole's inbox.

1443
00:57:57,791 --> 00:57:59,833
I'm looking for missing stock.

1444
00:58:05,708 --> 00:58:07,000
Wait,
what is that? "UG"?

1445
00:58:07,166 --> 00:58:09,541
It most likely
refers to urea granules.

1446
00:58:09,708 --> 00:58:11,458
Synthetic urea
appears frequently

1447
00:58:11,625 --> 00:58:12,875
on Viking's records.

1448
00:58:13,583 --> 00:58:15,291
All right,
still looking.

1449
00:58:18,208 --> 00:58:19,208
Who's "the three of us"?

1450
00:58:20,958 --> 00:58:22,541
There's an email
from the sixth.

1451
00:58:22,708 --> 00:58:24,708
UG. Holt knew.

1452
00:58:27,833 --> 00:58:28,833
How much was missing?

1453
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:30,541
For the past
six months...

1454
00:58:30,708 --> 00:58:33,708
every delivery to Biobeauty
has had a discrepancy.

1455
00:58:33,875 --> 00:58:35,458
Each shipment
has had an additional...

1456
00:58:35,625 --> 00:58:37,833
50 kilo container
of urea granules...

1457
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:38,916
listed on
the delivery docket.

1458
00:58:39,083 --> 00:58:39,958
So, they're getting
overcharged?

1459
00:58:40,125 --> 00:58:41,875
No. The physical order
is correct,

1460
00:58:42,041 --> 00:58:43,875
and they're being
charged appropriately.

1461
00:58:44,916 --> 00:58:46,166
It's only the delivery docket

1462
00:58:46,333 --> 00:58:48,583
that lists an additional
50 kilo container.

1463
00:58:48,750 --> 00:58:49,916
Someone's gaming
the stock records...

1464
00:58:50,083 --> 00:58:50,958
to cover up the fact that

1465
00:58:51,125 --> 00:58:52,500
urea granules
are going missing.

1466
00:58:52,666 --> 00:58:54,625
Six months at maybe
six missing containers,

1467
00:58:54,791 --> 00:58:55,541
what's that?

1468
00:58:55,708 --> 00:58:58,083
Three hundred kilos.
What's that worth to someone?

1469
00:58:58,250 --> 00:58:59,833
Synthetic urea is a component

1470
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:01,708
of several
dermatological products.

1471
00:59:01,875 --> 00:59:04,708
It can also be used
in agricultural fertilizers...

1472
00:59:04,875 --> 00:59:06,875
and in the production
of methamphetamine.

1473
00:59:08,125 --> 00:59:10,791
Drug use is endemic
in Red Zones across the city.

1474
00:59:13,291 --> 00:59:15,000
There is an extremely
lucrative black market

1475
00:59:15,208 --> 00:59:16,791
for industrial-grade urea.

1476
00:59:16,958 --> 00:59:18,625
These are the people
who are committing crimes...

1477
00:59:18,791 --> 00:59:21,083
and we want to separate them
from the others in society.

1478
00:59:21,250 --> 00:59:23,458
So if someone took it
and sold it, they made bank.

1479
00:59:24,833 --> 00:59:26,791
Sure as hell wouldn't
want to get caught.

1480
00:59:27,125 --> 00:59:28,041
So maybe Holt found something,

1481
00:59:28,208 --> 00:59:29,208
didn't get a chance
to tell Nic.

1482
00:59:30,500 --> 00:59:32,750
Open Holt's inbox.
Search Nicole Raven.

1483
00:59:38,791 --> 00:59:41,750
Okay, this was Friday,
2:30 p.m.

1484
00:59:55,333 --> 00:59:56,750
It's gone
too far already,

1485
00:59:56,916 --> 00:59:58,208
we should just go to the cops.

1486
00:59:58,375 --> 00:59:59,375
I can
make things right!

1487
00:59:59,541 --> 01:00:00,500
Just give me a few days.

1488
01:00:00,666 --> 01:00:02,000
It will not be a problem.

1489
01:00:03,791 --> 01:00:05,541
- Cool?
- No, it's not cool.

1490
01:00:05,708 --> 01:00:06,666
It's not
that complicated!

1491
01:00:06,833 --> 01:00:07,791
It is complicated.

1492
01:00:07,958 --> 01:00:09,500
My job is on the line!

1493
01:00:14,708 --> 01:00:16,750
Holt's always
had a gambling problem.

1494
01:00:17,291 --> 01:00:18,583
I need Holt's financials.

1495
01:00:18,750 --> 01:00:19,958
Can you give me
the last six months?

1496
01:00:20,125 --> 01:00:21,750
Bank, credit card,
anything you can.

1497
01:00:27,958 --> 01:00:28,958
Oh, my God.

1498
01:00:30,375 --> 01:00:32,250
Holy shit,
he's in big trouble.

1499
01:00:37,458 --> 01:00:38,666
Rob's been bailing him out?

1500
01:00:38,833 --> 01:00:39,750
Well, this is it.
This is it, right?

1501
01:00:39,916 --> 01:00:40,750
I mean, we got him.

1502
01:00:45,708 --> 01:00:46,708
You're not serious.

1503
01:00:46,875 --> 01:00:49,208
Money is a motive,
but it's only in theory.

1504
01:00:49,375 --> 01:00:50,708
You have
no concrete evidence...

1505
01:00:50,875 --> 01:00:53,083
as to how Holt Charles might
have committed the crime.

1506
01:00:53,250 --> 01:00:54,250
Let me talk to Rob.

1507
01:01:03,041 --> 01:01:04,791
Holy crap, Chris!

1508
01:01:04,958 --> 01:01:07,416
They told us you were
at that Mercy place. You okay?

1509
01:01:07,583 --> 01:01:08,583
This is Judge Maddox.

1510
01:01:08,750 --> 01:01:10,166
You're indeed speaking
to the Mercy Court...

1511
01:01:10,333 --> 01:01:11,541
where Detective Raven
is standing trial

1512
01:01:11,708 --> 01:01:13,000
for his wife's murder.

1513
01:01:13,166 --> 01:01:14,250
Yes, ma'am.
That's what I heard.

1514
01:01:14,416 --> 01:01:15,500
I believe
Detective Raven

1515
01:01:15,666 --> 01:01:17,333
wishes to speak
with Robert Nelson.

1516
01:01:17,500 --> 01:01:19,416
Yeah. I'll just go find him.

1517
01:01:19,583 --> 01:01:20,625
I was just walking by,

1518
01:01:20,791 --> 01:01:22,125
I saw the call
open on the computer.

1519
01:01:22,291 --> 01:01:23,958
I guess he left the app open.

1520
01:01:24,125 --> 01:01:25,250
And, Chris...

1521
01:01:26,041 --> 01:01:27,041
Good luck, pal.

1522
01:01:27,541 --> 01:01:28,541
Gimme a second.

1523
01:01:30,458 --> 01:01:31,708
Son of a bitch.

1524
01:01:31,875 --> 01:01:33,666
Hey, Fred, can you
drive me around the yard?

1525
01:01:34,708 --> 01:01:35,791
If he is involved,
he may flee,

1526
01:01:35,958 --> 01:01:37,000
and time is very short.

1527
01:01:37,166 --> 01:01:38,166
All right.

1528
01:01:39,416 --> 01:01:40,208
We're gonna have
to make him talk.

1529
01:01:40,375 --> 01:01:41,166
Jaq's gonna have
to make him talk.

1530
01:01:41,333 --> 01:01:42,333
Where is she?

1531
01:01:42,750 --> 01:01:45,583
Detective Diallo
is four minutes away.

1532
01:01:48,500 --> 01:01:50,625
Maddox, can you track
where he was this morning?

1533
01:01:50,791 --> 01:01:52,958
I am having trouble
verifying a clear alibi...

1534
01:01:53,125 --> 01:01:55,250
from his whereabouts
at the time of the murder.

1535
01:01:56,083 --> 01:01:58,583
I'm tracking his phone in case
he does attempt to flee.

1536
01:01:58,750 --> 01:02:00,083
Okay, good.
Hey, do you have a status

1537
01:02:00,250 --> 01:02:01,625
on Peterson's
bird cam footage?

1538
01:02:01,791 --> 01:02:02,666
I mean,
if he was at the house,

1539
01:02:02,833 --> 01:02:03,666
the camera
might've caught him.

1540
01:02:03,833 --> 01:02:04,833
Loading.

1541
01:02:06,375 --> 01:02:07,375
Almost there.

1542
01:02:07,541 --> 01:02:09,666
Yo, any idea where Rob's at?

1543
01:02:10,875 --> 01:02:11,958
I have
this morning's footage

1544
01:02:12,125 --> 01:02:13,833
from Bill Peterson's
bird camera.

1545
01:02:15,291 --> 01:02:16,291
I'm afraid there's nothing.

1546
01:02:16,458 --> 01:02:17,583
What? Nothing?

1547
01:02:17,750 --> 01:02:19,500
All right, just show me.
Slower.

1548
01:02:24,416 --> 01:02:25,916
Slower. Slower.

1549
01:02:27,291 --> 01:02:29,333
Wait, what? What's this one?
The timing's right.

1550
01:02:29,875 --> 01:02:31,625
The camera
was motion activated at...

1551
01:02:31,791 --> 01:02:33,833
10:08 a.m.

1552
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:35,250
God damn it, is that...
That's all?

1553
01:02:35,416 --> 01:02:37,208
The camera was not
triggered again until...

1554
01:02:37,375 --> 01:02:38,958
11:43 a.m.

1555
01:02:39,125 --> 01:02:40,875
All right, well,
he still had to get out.

1556
01:02:41,041 --> 01:02:42,041
Did Bill go anywhere today?

1557
01:02:42,541 --> 01:02:43,541
Phone tracking shows

1558
01:02:43,708 --> 01:02:45,875
that Bill Peterson
left his home at...

1559
01:02:46,041 --> 01:02:47,833
11:23 this morning.

1560
01:02:49,333 --> 01:02:51,166
The Internet outage
in Bill Peterson's grid...

1561
01:02:51,333 --> 01:02:54,000
affected traffic cameras
in that area, too.

1562
01:02:54,166 --> 01:02:55,625
We will have to wait
for them to update.

1563
01:02:55,791 --> 01:02:57,458
Hey, Chris, you there, man?

1564
01:02:57,958 --> 01:02:58,958
I said I needed Rob.

1565
01:02:59,125 --> 01:03:01,250
Yeah, I wasn't
able to find him.

1566
01:03:01,416 --> 01:03:02,458
Quit stalling.

1567
01:03:02,625 --> 01:03:04,208
Whoa, I'm not stalling, man.
Chill.

1568
01:03:04,375 --> 01:03:05,916
Bullshit.
I was gonna ask...

1569
01:03:06,083 --> 01:03:07,916
Rob to keep you there,
but the cavalry is about to...

1570
01:03:08,083 --> 01:03:09,541
- break your goddamn door down.
- What?

1571
01:03:09,708 --> 01:03:11,166
I know about
the missing chemicals.

1572
01:03:11,333 --> 01:03:12,875
I know about the hole
you're in with the bank.

1573
01:03:13,041 --> 01:03:13,958
You stole product...

1574
01:03:14,125 --> 01:03:15,000
and you murdered Nic
so she couldn't talk.

1575
01:03:15,166 --> 01:03:16,041
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
I didn't hurt anyone, man.

1576
01:03:16,208 --> 01:03:17,500
This is nuts.
I was just trying to help him.

1577
01:03:17,666 --> 01:03:19,791
- I owed him one.
- Owed... who, what?

1578
01:03:23,208 --> 01:03:24,833
Holt, what are you
talking about?

1579
01:03:29,333 --> 01:03:30,541
- Holt!
- Rob, okay?

1580
01:03:30,708 --> 01:03:31,875
I owed Rob.

1581
01:03:34,750 --> 01:03:36,083
- What?
- Me and Nic found out...

1582
01:03:36,250 --> 01:03:37,666
he was making
product disappear.

1583
01:03:38,166 --> 01:03:39,083
And, I mean, shit, we all know

1584
01:03:39,250 --> 01:03:40,791
what the stuff that comes
through here is worth...

1585
01:03:40,958 --> 01:03:42,291
but he's been good to me, man.

1586
01:03:42,458 --> 01:03:43,458
To all of us.

1587
01:03:43,625 --> 01:03:45,208
Hell, he's your sponsor,
for Christ's sake.

1588
01:03:45,375 --> 01:03:46,708
Where is he?

1589
01:03:46,875 --> 01:03:47,958
I don't know, dude.

1590
01:03:48,125 --> 01:03:49,875
- I can't find him.
- Holt, where is he?

1591
01:03:51,958 --> 01:03:54,916
Carly said he took off
in one of the trucks, okay?

1592
01:03:55,583 --> 01:03:56,583
He just got back
from a sick day...

1593
01:03:56,750 --> 01:03:57,958
she figured
he wasn't feeling good...

1594
01:03:58,125 --> 01:04:00,125
- and he left. But...
- Wait, Rob was off yesterday?

1595
01:04:00,291 --> 01:04:01,583
Yeah. He didn't come in

1596
01:04:01,750 --> 01:04:03,583
until he was done
at the port this morning.

1597
01:04:04,416 --> 01:04:06,083
Last time I saw him
was at your place on Sunday...

1598
01:04:06,250 --> 01:04:07,541
and he said he wanted
to talk to Nic

1599
01:04:07,708 --> 01:04:08,916
the way he talked to me.

1600
01:04:09,083 --> 01:04:10,541
Let her know it was all gonna
be cool, you know?

1601
01:04:10,708 --> 01:04:13,750
But... wanted to do it
after everyone else left.

1602
01:04:13,916 --> 01:04:15,875
Even got me to drive
his car home for him...

1603
01:04:16,041 --> 01:04:18,875
so the folks he gave a ride to
weren't left waiting.

1604
01:04:19,333 --> 01:04:21,000
He stayed on,
and you drove his car?

1605
01:04:21,500 --> 01:04:22,625
Yeah. Like I said.

1606
01:04:22,791 --> 01:04:23,875
Son of a bitch.

1607
01:04:24,041 --> 01:04:26,125
I tried talking to him
at your place the weekend...

1608
01:04:26,291 --> 01:04:27,625
Viking trucks are all tracked?

1609
01:04:31,875 --> 01:04:32,875
Okay. Uh...

1610
01:04:33,041 --> 01:04:34,833
There. That one.
The one in Los Feliz.

1611
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:36,041
That is Robert
Nelson's home address.

1612
01:04:36,208 --> 01:04:37,208
The truck is not moving.

1613
01:04:37,375 --> 01:04:38,500
Jaq, are you hearing me?

1614
01:04:39,291 --> 01:04:41,041
- I'm touching down at Viking.
- No, scratch that.

1615
01:04:41,208 --> 01:04:43,458
You need to get
to 698 Tracy Street.

1616
01:04:43,625 --> 01:04:45,208
We're going after Rob Nelson.

1617
01:04:45,375 --> 01:04:46,791
Your Rob?

1618
01:04:46,958 --> 01:04:48,250
All right, I'm on my way.

1619
01:04:48,416 --> 01:04:49,541
SWAT unit four,

1620
01:04:49,708 --> 01:04:51,583
head over
to 698 Tracy Street...

1621
01:04:51,750 --> 01:04:52,958
- stat.
- Roger that.

1622
01:04:53,125 --> 01:04:54,375
Local units
and the nearest patrolling

1623
01:04:54,541 --> 01:04:55,708
SWAT team have been alerted

1624
01:04:55,875 --> 01:04:57,125
I helped Rob
get a gun license last year.

1625
01:04:57,291 --> 01:04:58,125
He's got weapons at the house.

1626
01:04:58,291 --> 01:04:59,500
The footage
of Bill Peterson's

1627
01:04:59,666 --> 01:05:00,791
car journey has buffered.

1628
01:05:27,166 --> 01:05:28,125
What, still?

1629
01:05:28,291 --> 01:05:30,041
In the absence of new,
verifiable facts...

1630
01:05:30,208 --> 01:05:31,750
your guilt is holding
above the threshold.

1631
01:05:31,916 --> 01:05:33,291
Do you honestly think
that I killed Nic?

1632
01:05:33,458 --> 01:05:34,458
The facts are all that
I'm permitted...

1633
01:05:34,625 --> 01:05:36,625
- to consider.
- Come on. What's your gut say?

1634
01:05:36,791 --> 01:05:37,791
I do not function that way.

1635
01:05:37,958 --> 01:05:39,041
What about
what you said to Britt?

1636
01:05:39,208 --> 01:05:41,208
You told her that
maybe I didn't kill Nic.

1637
01:05:41,375 --> 01:05:42,416
- You remember?
- No, I was merely

1638
01:05:42,583 --> 01:05:43,708
- acknowledging the...
- Bullshit!

1639
01:05:43,875 --> 01:05:45,166
I'm just asking,
what do you think?

1640
01:05:45,333 --> 01:05:46,541
I cannot...
I'm not...

1641
01:05:47,333 --> 01:05:49,250
I'm not supposed to...

1642
01:05:50,208 --> 01:05:51,375
This is
the Mercy Capital Court.

1643
01:05:51,541 --> 01:05:52,500
I'm Judge Maddox,

1644
01:05:52,666 --> 01:05:53,708
and I'm going
to preside over your...

1645
01:05:53,875 --> 01:05:54,916
...court, I'm Judge Maddox...

1646
01:05:55,083 --> 01:05:56,166
and I'm going
to preside over your...

1647
01:05:56,333 --> 01:05:57,333
- You all right?
- I am.

1648
01:05:57,750 --> 01:05:59,041
I'm functioning
within normal parameters.

1649
01:05:59,166 --> 01:06:00,250
Thank you.

1650
01:06:00,416 --> 01:06:01,833
Okay.

1651
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:03,958
Let's just
put a pin in that one.

1652
01:06:06,625 --> 01:06:07,541
This is Ten-David,
Lieutenant Vogel.

1653
01:06:07,708 --> 01:06:08,666
We're en route to your lead.

1654
01:06:08,833 --> 01:06:10,000
All right, Dan,
I'm glad it's you.

1655
01:06:10,166 --> 01:06:11,125
Chris, we're about
a minute out.

1656
01:06:11,291 --> 01:06:12,166
What do you got us
getting into?

1657
01:06:12,333 --> 01:06:14,541
I've identified a suspect
in my wife's murder.

1658
01:06:14,708 --> 01:06:16,125
Robert Nelson.

1659
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:18,333
He owns an AR-15,

1660
01:06:18,500 --> 01:06:19,916
and a semi compact
nine-millimeter.

1661
01:06:20,083 --> 01:06:21,083
Roger that.

1662
01:06:21,250 --> 01:06:23,291
All right, guys,
we're en route to location.

1663
01:06:23,458 --> 01:06:26,083
Suspect armed with an AR-15.

1664
01:06:26,250 --> 01:06:27,916
Go, go, go!

1665
01:06:29,208 --> 01:06:30,958
Occupant of 698...

1666
01:06:31,125 --> 01:06:32,291
this is Lieutenant Vogel

1667
01:06:32,458 --> 01:06:34,000
with the Los Angeles
Police Department.

1668
01:06:34,166 --> 01:06:36,666
Exit the residence
or we will make entry.

1669
01:06:40,041 --> 01:06:41,083
All right, Chris,
we're going in.

1670
01:06:41,916 --> 01:06:43,208
Diallo, touching down.

1671
01:06:45,083 --> 01:06:47,250
Never late for
the action, huh, Jaq?

1672
01:06:48,916 --> 01:06:49,958
LAPD!
We have a search warrant.

1673
01:06:50,125 --> 01:06:51,208
Open the door!

1674
01:06:55,041 --> 01:06:56,291
We made entry, Jaq.

1675
01:06:57,125 --> 01:06:58,916
Give me two in the bedroom!
Give me two in the bedroom!

1676
01:06:59,083 --> 01:07:00,083
Lock it down!

1677
01:07:00,250 --> 01:07:01,875
LAPD, we have
a search warrant!

1678
01:07:02,083 --> 01:07:03,500
Living room, clear!
Move, move!

1679
01:07:03,666 --> 01:07:04,750
Give me some people
in the backyard.

1680
01:07:04,916 --> 01:07:06,541
- Kitchen, clear!
- Let's go!

1681
01:07:07,166 --> 01:07:09,041
- He's not there.
- Spread out!

1682
01:07:09,208 --> 01:07:10,291
And where's
the damn truck?

1683
01:07:10,458 --> 01:07:11,875
The vehicle's GPS
is at the house.

1684
01:07:12,041 --> 01:07:13,666
Yeah, 'cause he took it off.

1685
01:07:13,833 --> 01:07:15,375
- Can you scan traffic cameras?
- I already am.

1686
01:07:15,541 --> 01:07:16,875
The license plates
of the trucks...

1687
01:07:17,041 --> 01:07:19,000
are not being detected
by any cameras in the city.

1688
01:07:19,166 --> 01:07:20,458
He probably
ditched 'em.

1689
01:07:20,625 --> 01:07:22,333
Jaq, I need you
to put out an APB

1690
01:07:22,500 --> 01:07:24,291
on a Viking Shipping Truck.

1691
01:07:24,458 --> 01:07:26,125
- Can we track it?
- No, we gotta go old school.

1692
01:07:26,291 --> 01:07:28,958
All units, be on the lookout
for a Viking Shipping Truck.

1693
01:07:29,125 --> 01:07:30,250
Could be anywhere in the city.

1694
01:07:30,416 --> 01:07:32,041
Chris, there's nobody
in the house. It's empty.

1695
01:07:32,208 --> 01:07:34,625
Just a bunch of hoarded crap
and memory lane stuff.

1696
01:07:34,791 --> 01:07:36,291
Wait, wait, wait.
Bring that back.

1697
01:07:36,458 --> 01:07:37,833
Stop. Stop right there.

1698
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:38,958
What's that picture
on the right?

1699
01:07:39,125 --> 01:07:41,208
Robert Nelson was
raised in a children's home.

1700
01:07:41,375 --> 01:07:43,083
His records were lost
in a data hack...

1701
01:07:43,250 --> 01:07:46,375
but this image most likely
dates from that time.

1702
01:07:46,541 --> 01:07:47,583
Can you pull that out?

1703
01:07:53,083 --> 01:07:53,791
Look at his arm.

1704
01:07:53,958 --> 01:07:54,666
There's someone else
in that picture with him.

1705
01:07:54,833 --> 01:07:56,333
Can you cross reference
and find a match?

1706
01:07:57,125 --> 01:07:58,416
Searching
for a match.

1707
01:07:58,583 --> 01:08:00,208
This may take a few minutes.

1708
01:08:01,291 --> 01:08:03,083
Can you pull any
cameras from earlier today?

1709
01:08:08,500 --> 01:08:10,250
Vogel, get outside.
Check the garage.

1710
01:08:10,416 --> 01:08:12,208
Roger that, Chris.
Jaq, did you get that?

1711
01:08:12,375 --> 01:08:13,375
We're out back.

1712
01:08:13,541 --> 01:08:14,541
Initiate.

1713
01:08:16,416 --> 01:08:18,000
- Move, move, move!
- All right, move in.

1714
01:08:18,166 --> 01:08:19,458
- Go! Go!
- Go, go! Go!

1715
01:08:20,875 --> 01:08:22,083
- Corners clear.
- What we got here?

1716
01:08:22,250 --> 01:08:23,666
Active fire.
Active fire.

1717
01:08:31,333 --> 01:08:32,333
Ten-David, clear.

1718
01:08:35,083 --> 01:08:35,958
Looks like
he's been planning

1719
01:08:36,125 --> 01:08:37,041
something for a while.

1720
01:08:38,250 --> 01:08:39,416
He's burned all the evidence.

1721
01:08:39,583 --> 01:08:41,666
He's cutting and running
with the chemicals, right?

1722
01:08:41,833 --> 01:08:43,000
There's gotta
be a good reason.

1723
01:08:43,166 --> 01:08:44,541
One last payday? Selling them?

1724
01:08:44,708 --> 01:08:45,708
There are four known

1725
01:08:45,875 --> 01:08:47,833
Red Zone drug lab operations
in the city.

1726
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:48,958
No, he'll never get that rig
in the Red Zone.

1727
01:08:49,125 --> 01:08:50,083
He'll get mobbed.

1728
01:08:51,708 --> 01:08:52,541
What if he cooked
the drugs already

1729
01:08:52,708 --> 01:08:53,625
and he's hauling
finished product?

1730
01:08:53,791 --> 01:08:55,500
If he has
manufactured product...

1731
01:08:55,666 --> 01:08:57,958
the estimated street value
would be in excess of...

1732
01:08:58,125 --> 01:08:59,208
16 million dollars.

1733
01:08:59,375 --> 01:09:01,333
I mean, could he have?
Could he have? He made drugs?

1734
01:09:01,958 --> 01:09:03,250
Rob Nelson achieved
a master's degree

1735
01:09:03,416 --> 01:09:04,791
in electrical engineering.

1736
01:09:04,958 --> 01:09:06,375
There are potentially
transferable skills

1737
01:09:06,541 --> 01:09:07,875
from that to chemistry.

1738
01:09:08,041 --> 01:09:09,583
Yeah, we gotta figure he's
headin' to a supply meeting.

1739
01:09:09,750 --> 01:09:11,083
Take the cash, disappear.

1740
01:09:15,083 --> 01:09:16,166
Hey, Jaq, can you go back?

1741
01:09:16,333 --> 01:09:17,458
Go back.

1742
01:09:20,208 --> 01:09:22,000
See that? He wasn't at Viking
last time we called him.

1743
01:09:22,166 --> 01:09:23,166
He was already here.

1744
01:09:26,166 --> 01:09:27,375
What, to your house?
To the barbecue?

1745
01:09:27,541 --> 01:09:29,541
Hey, Lieutenant,
take a look at this.

1746
01:09:30,166 --> 01:09:30,916
Carla, Marie, and Leo.

1747
01:09:31,083 --> 01:09:31,875
Chris, we might
have something here.

1748
01:09:32,041 --> 01:09:33,375
Some kinda
chemical in here.

1749
01:09:36,833 --> 01:09:38,666
Those contained urea granules.

1750
01:09:38,833 --> 01:09:40,458
So he was cooking product.

1751
01:09:40,625 --> 01:09:42,291
Holy shit.

1752
01:09:43,125 --> 01:09:44,625
Chris, what the hell?

1753
01:09:45,125 --> 01:09:47,125
See that? He took
the plates off the truck.

1754
01:09:47,833 --> 01:09:49,875
It was all here, hidden away.

1755
01:09:50,041 --> 01:09:51,541
He's completely offline,
no digital trail.

1756
01:09:51,708 --> 01:09:52,625
No wonder you missed it,
Maddox.

1757
01:09:52,791 --> 01:09:53,916
Some sort of handbook.

1758
01:09:55,083 --> 01:09:56,083
Checking it out.

1759
01:09:56,583 --> 01:09:57,541
And what
are we looking at?

1760
01:09:57,708 --> 01:09:58,750
This is
a terrorist's handbook.

1761
01:09:58,916 --> 01:10:00,000
- What?
- Urea can be combined

1762
01:10:00,166 --> 01:10:01,083
with nitric acid...

1763
01:10:01,250 --> 01:10:02,625
to produce urea nitrate...

1764
01:10:02,791 --> 01:10:04,333
which is an extremely
high explosive.

1765
01:10:14,875 --> 01:10:16,500
Viking ships
nitric too.

1766
01:10:16,666 --> 01:10:18,208
It was all there for him.

1767
01:10:19,083 --> 01:10:20,541
He's made a bomb.

1768
01:10:22,916 --> 01:10:24,000
Dan, he's got a bomb
in that truck.

1769
01:10:24,166 --> 01:10:25,416
We need to know
what his target is.

1770
01:10:25,583 --> 01:10:27,666
All right, guys.
Drop it, toss everything,

1771
01:10:27,833 --> 01:10:29,000
look for a target.

1772
01:10:29,166 --> 01:10:30,375
Shit just got real, Jaq.

1773
01:10:30,541 --> 01:10:31,916
Chris, I have it.

1774
01:10:32,083 --> 01:10:33,083
Dan,
I'm going after our sub.

1775
01:10:33,250 --> 01:10:34,291
Roger that.

1776
01:10:34,458 --> 01:10:36,125
How much explosives
is he carrying?

1777
01:10:36,750 --> 01:10:37,708
Based
on the ride height,

1778
01:10:37,875 --> 01:10:38,750
the load on the suspension...

1779
01:10:38,916 --> 01:10:41,208
appears to weigh
in excess of 3,000 pounds.

1780
01:10:42,625 --> 01:10:43,958
All right. Where's
he going in that thing?

1781
01:10:44,125 --> 01:10:46,958
He's heading south
on the 101 towards Downtown.

1782
01:10:47,750 --> 01:10:49,000
Wait,
did he just speed up?

1783
01:10:49,166 --> 01:10:50,333
His speed
is increasing.

1784
01:10:50,500 --> 01:10:52,750
Sixty... 70 miles per hour.

1785
01:10:52,916 --> 01:10:54,958
He will reach Downtown
in three minutes.

1786
01:10:55,125 --> 01:10:56,250
Chris, I have a match.

1787
01:10:57,625 --> 01:10:58,833
Can you find out
who that is?

1788
01:11:06,083 --> 01:11:07,375
Wait.

1789
01:11:07,541 --> 01:11:08,583
David Webb?

1790
01:11:21,625 --> 01:11:24,041
David Webb was taken
into care of child services...

1791
01:11:24,208 --> 01:11:25,541
along with
his older brother...

1792
01:11:25,708 --> 01:11:27,083
Robert Webb.

1793
01:11:27,250 --> 01:11:29,541
But they were parted
when Robert was adopted alone.

1794
01:11:31,166 --> 01:11:33,958
They changed Rob's name when
he was adopted by the Nelsons.

1795
01:11:34,125 --> 01:11:36,583
Meeting me at AA,
sponsoring me...

1796
01:11:36,750 --> 01:11:38,458
it all came after
the Webb trial.

1797
01:11:39,500 --> 01:11:43,125
This was never about Nic.
It was about me and you.

1798
01:11:43,291 --> 01:11:44,625
His target is the Mercy Court.

1799
01:11:44,791 --> 01:11:46,541
Jaq, his target is Mercy.

1800
01:11:46,708 --> 01:11:49,708
He's doin' it for revenge.
Rob is David Webb's brother.

1801
01:11:49,875 --> 01:11:50,875
What?

1802
01:11:51,041 --> 01:11:53,416
I processed
Webb myself, Chris.

1803
01:11:56,791 --> 01:11:58,291
I'm detecting
a second heat signature

1804
01:11:58,458 --> 01:11:59,833
in the cabin of the truck.

1805
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:02,250
Sending in a drone
for visual confirmation.

1806
01:12:04,583 --> 01:12:05,916
Did he just talk to someone?

1807
01:12:06,083 --> 01:12:08,541
If he speaks again,
I'll attempt to decipher it.

1808
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:16,000
Who the hell is that?

1809
01:12:16,958 --> 01:12:19,666
I'm back tracing the truck's
route before we acquired it.

1810
01:12:22,541 --> 01:12:24,708
Wait. Can I talk
to Britt quick?

1811
01:12:26,791 --> 01:12:28,208
Please, Maddox.

1812
01:12:34,708 --> 01:12:36,125
- Hello.
- Jeff, put Britt on.

1813
01:12:36,291 --> 01:12:37,416
You had your chance
to talk to her, Chris.

1814
01:12:37,583 --> 01:12:38,916
- You'll never get another one.
- I didn't do it, Jeff.

1815
01:12:39,083 --> 01:12:41,125
- I'm not gonna listen to this!
- And I've got the guy who did.

1816
01:12:41,291 --> 01:12:42,666
Did you hear me?
I didn't do it.

1817
01:12:42,833 --> 01:12:44,916
- Wait, you mean...
- Now put Britt on.

1818
01:12:45,083 --> 01:12:46,083
Uh...

1819
01:12:46,583 --> 01:12:49,208
She went out front
to get some air, I guess.

1820
01:12:50,041 --> 01:12:51,041
I'll be back in a sec.

1821
01:12:51,750 --> 01:12:54,583
Maddox, pull up
Jeff's doorbell camera.

1822
01:12:59,208 --> 01:13:01,833
No. No way.

1823
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:03,208
No, he wouldn't.

1824
01:13:03,375 --> 01:13:04,416
- No! What are...
- Just take...

1825
01:13:04,583 --> 01:13:05,666
- No.
- Grandpa!

1826
01:13:06,166 --> 01:13:09,250
No, no way. No.

1827
01:13:09,833 --> 01:13:11,541
Jaq, it's Britt.

1828
01:13:11,708 --> 01:13:13,625
Get in the air,
you gotta get on that truck.

1829
01:13:14,916 --> 01:13:17,125
Jaq, we got a timer!

1830
01:13:18,125 --> 01:13:19,125
Dan, get out!
Get outta there!

1831
01:13:19,291 --> 01:13:20,666
Avalanche!
Avalanche! Avalanche!

1832
01:13:20,833 --> 01:13:22,083
Get the hell
outta there.

1833
01:13:22,250 --> 01:13:23,833
Everyone, move!
Get outta there!

1834
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:25,416
Now, now, get out!

1835
01:13:37,208 --> 01:13:38,000
Put it out,
put it out!

1836
01:13:38,166 --> 01:13:38,958
Jaq?

1837
01:13:41,916 --> 01:13:43,291
Jaq, Jaq?

1838
01:13:44,166 --> 01:13:45,000
Jaq?

1839
01:13:47,541 --> 01:13:49,125
Could that have been it?

1840
01:13:49,291 --> 01:13:50,625
Could that have been the bomb?

1841
01:13:51,916 --> 01:13:53,125
Maddox?

1842
01:13:53,291 --> 01:13:55,458
That was only a small volume
of the explosive materials...

1843
01:13:55,625 --> 01:13:57,041
that he likely had available.

1844
01:13:57,791 --> 01:13:58,875
If he detonates...

1845
01:14:01,875 --> 01:14:04,833
fatalities could number
in the thousands.

1846
01:14:06,458 --> 01:14:07,750
Oh, my God.

1847
01:14:08,708 --> 01:14:09,708
Jaq, you okay?

1848
01:14:10,583 --> 01:14:12,291
Yeah, yeah, I'm okay, Chris.

1849
01:14:13,250 --> 01:14:14,833
The SWAT team, Vogel...

1850
01:14:15,666 --> 01:14:16,625
We can't let him

1851
01:14:16,791 --> 01:14:17,625
- get away with this.
- I know.

1852
01:14:17,791 --> 01:14:19,250
He's gonna pay.

1853
01:14:19,416 --> 01:14:21,541
I'm sorry, but you gotta move.

1854
01:14:21,708 --> 01:14:23,708
Get after that truck.
We gotta stop him.

1855
01:14:30,166 --> 01:14:31,708
I will stop the trial
immediately... and the chair

1856
01:14:31,875 --> 01:14:33,125
- will release you.
- Wait. No, no.

1857
01:14:33,291 --> 01:14:34,250
- I have to.
- You stop the trial,

1858
01:14:34,416 --> 01:14:35,250
we cut off.

1859
01:14:35,416 --> 01:14:36,833
Right? We lose cloud access?

1860
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:38,291
- Yes, correct.
- No.

1861
01:14:38,458 --> 01:14:39,416
No way.
We gotta stop Rob first.

1862
01:14:39,583 --> 01:14:41,166
- I'm staying in the chair.
- The SWAT team are all dead.

1863
01:14:41,333 --> 01:14:42,583
If the SWAT team are dead...

1864
01:14:42,750 --> 01:14:43,833
and Nic is dead,

1865
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:45,625
and if Rob gets away
with whatever he's planned...

1866
01:14:45,791 --> 01:14:47,958
then they will all have
died for nothing.

1867
01:14:49,083 --> 01:14:51,166
- The rules of this court...
- To hell with the rules.

1868
01:14:51,333 --> 01:14:52,750
- No. I cannot... No!
- Break 'em. Bend 'em!

1869
01:14:52,916 --> 01:14:55,833
And if you stay in that chair,
you're going to be executed.

1870
01:14:59,125 --> 01:15:00,416
Everything you deduced...

1871
01:15:01,708 --> 01:15:02,708
The facts...

1872
01:15:03,791 --> 01:15:05,000
made it appear impossible.

1873
01:15:05,166 --> 01:15:06,166
Impossible.

1874
01:15:06,333 --> 01:15:09,083
Your...
gut instincts were...

1875
01:15:10,916 --> 01:15:12,291
- right.
- Yeah, I was right.

1876
01:15:12,458 --> 01:15:13,583
What if I...
failed them?

1877
01:15:13,750 --> 01:15:14,750
If you failed any of them,

1878
01:15:14,916 --> 01:15:16,583
then I guess
we're in the same boat.

1879
01:15:16,750 --> 01:15:18,250
Turns out I've failed
the people I love the most.

1880
01:15:18,416 --> 01:15:21,291
I've been a deadbeat husband,
a lousy father...

1881
01:15:21,458 --> 01:15:22,750
So, it looks like we both
need to accept the fact

1882
01:15:22,916 --> 01:15:24,416
that we failed people.

1883
01:15:24,583 --> 01:15:27,208
But we've got this one chance
to make up for it.

1884
01:15:27,375 --> 01:15:29,166
We can make up for it
by stopping Rob

1885
01:15:29,333 --> 01:15:31,208
from hurting anybody else.

1886
01:15:31,375 --> 01:15:33,625
And we need to stop him,
the same way we found him.

1887
01:15:34,833 --> 01:15:35,958
Together.

1888
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:40,000
Okay.

1889
01:15:41,125 --> 01:15:42,333
LAPD units are in position.

1890
01:15:42,500 --> 01:15:44,708
The stolen big rig
here now on the highway,

1891
01:15:44,875 --> 01:15:46,208
you can see it. Looks like...

1892
01:15:46,416 --> 01:15:47,958
Suspect
is exiting the 101.

1893
01:15:48,125 --> 01:15:50,291
Jaq, we gotta
get him out of Downtown.

1894
01:15:50,458 --> 01:15:51,291
It's too populated.

1895
01:15:51,458 --> 01:15:54,041
Yeah, well, I'm all open
to ideas here, Chris.

1896
01:15:55,375 --> 01:15:56,750
We've got units
in place at the off-ramp

1897
01:15:56,916 --> 01:15:58,208
ready to intercept.

1898
01:15:59,500 --> 01:16:00,500
Oh, shit!

1899
01:16:02,500 --> 01:16:03,708
- What can I do to help?
- Can you bring up the map...

1900
01:16:03,875 --> 01:16:05,541
so we can track his route?

1901
01:16:05,708 --> 01:16:06,708
Now!

1902
01:16:06,875 --> 01:16:08,416
If his target
is the Mercy Court...

1903
01:16:08,583 --> 01:16:10,291
we will not have
much time to stop him

1904
01:16:10,458 --> 01:16:12,250
before he reaches
the Mercy building.

1905
01:16:12,416 --> 01:16:14,875
Okay, I need tactical.
Get Havelock on the line.

1906
01:16:15,875 --> 01:16:17,416
Hold back! Goddamn it!

1907
01:16:17,583 --> 01:16:18,583
I'm tailing him.

1908
01:16:18,750 --> 01:16:19,791
Backup's just arrived
on the scene.

1909
01:16:30,583 --> 01:16:32,500
Captain Havelock with
tactical has been notified.

1910
01:16:33,166 --> 01:16:34,041
We will establish

1911
01:16:34,208 --> 01:16:35,541
a communication line
with him shortly.

1912
01:16:36,875 --> 01:16:38,208
We're gonna go live to
our news chopper right now...

1913
01:16:38,375 --> 01:16:39,583
give us some more information

1914
01:16:39,750 --> 01:16:41,583
and a better perspective
of this chase...

1915
01:16:41,750 --> 01:16:43,708
that's going on through
Downtown, Los Angeles.

1916
01:16:46,250 --> 01:16:47,583
Police say
it is very dangerous.

1917
01:16:47,750 --> 01:16:51,250
It is being chased
by several LAPD squad cars.

1918
01:16:58,208 --> 01:16:59,291
Okay,
we are warning people

1919
01:16:59,458 --> 01:17:00,541
to not go outside...

1920
01:17:00,708 --> 01:17:02,833
and try and take pictures
of this chase.

1921
01:17:03,708 --> 01:17:06,625
Devastating situation
right now on Grand Avenue.

1922
01:17:13,916 --> 01:17:14,833
Chris,
you're live with Havelock.

1923
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:15,833
Go ahead, Havelock.

1924
01:17:17,208 --> 01:17:19,000
This is Captain Havelock
with tactical.

1925
01:17:19,166 --> 01:17:20,416
If you push him east
on 6th Street,

1926
01:17:20,583 --> 01:17:22,458
I can have a blockade
set up in five.

1927
01:17:22,625 --> 01:17:23,666
It's far enough
out of Downtown...

1928
01:17:23,833 --> 01:17:26,125
that we could try to stop him
and retrieve the hostage.

1929
01:17:26,291 --> 01:17:27,208
We'll have units
surrounding him

1930
01:17:27,375 --> 01:17:28,333
at the end of the bridge.

1931
01:17:28,500 --> 01:17:29,583
SWAT will come in
with a helicopter

1932
01:17:29,750 --> 01:17:30,958
to get your daughter out.

1933
01:17:33,500 --> 01:17:34,625
Chris?

1934
01:17:34,791 --> 01:17:35,791
Do it.

1935
01:17:35,958 --> 01:17:37,875
Diallo to all units,
I need you code 100...

1936
01:17:38,041 --> 01:17:40,250
on the intersection
of South Grand and 6th Street.

1937
01:17:40,416 --> 01:17:42,750
Cut his options.
Force him east on 6th.

1938
01:17:50,125 --> 01:17:51,541
All right. We got him.
He's going for it.

1939
01:17:51,708 --> 01:17:52,666
Havelock,
I hope you're ready

1940
01:17:52,833 --> 01:17:53,750
'cause we're sending him
your way.

1941
01:17:55,333 --> 01:17:56,583
All set here,
Diallo.

1942
01:17:56,750 --> 01:17:58,166
As long as he stays on 6th...

1943
01:17:58,333 --> 01:17:59,708
you'll lead him
straight to us.

1944
01:17:59,875 --> 01:18:00,875
Roger that.

1945
01:18:01,041 --> 01:18:03,333
All units, keep him on 6th.
Do not let him turn off.

1946
01:18:03,500 --> 01:18:05,791
Prepare to initiate plan A
on my command.

1947
01:18:05,958 --> 01:18:07,000
Control,
suspect is now heading

1948
01:18:07,166 --> 01:18:09,375
towards the Viaduct Bridge.
Over.

1949
01:18:09,541 --> 01:18:12,500
Chris,
the SWAT team is arriving.

1950
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:15,750
Very dangerous
situation here.

1951
01:18:15,958 --> 01:18:17,083
We're looking at a...

1952
01:18:17,250 --> 01:18:19,083
Aerial unit
is in pursuit.

1953
01:18:19,250 --> 01:18:20,416
Havelock, are you ready?

1954
01:18:20,583 --> 01:18:21,583
Affirmative.

1955
01:18:21,750 --> 01:18:23,666
Tactical is clear
to begin rescue operations...

1956
01:18:23,833 --> 01:18:25,000
as soon as he reaches
the viaduct.

1957
01:18:25,166 --> 01:18:26,833
We'll have 60 seconds
before he clears the bridge.

1958
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:29,208
Okay, he's being
directed towards the bridge.

1959
01:18:29,375 --> 01:18:30,541
Take a look at this. Wow.

1960
01:18:30,708 --> 01:18:32,916
Okay, SWAT officers
are now on the scene.

1961
01:18:33,083 --> 01:18:34,083
They are dropping in...

1962
01:18:34,250 --> 01:18:35,625
Easy does it, boys.

1963
01:18:35,791 --> 01:18:37,250
No, Jaq.
Tell 'em they're too close!

1964
01:18:37,416 --> 01:18:38,458
Pull back! Pull back!

1965
01:18:38,625 --> 01:18:39,750
Not too close now.

1966
01:18:41,041 --> 01:18:42,083
Target is boxed in.

1967
01:18:42,250 --> 01:18:43,750
Aerial unit
is touching down...

1968
01:18:43,916 --> 01:18:44,916
Oh, shit!

1969
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:48,333
Fall back! Fall back!

1970
01:18:49,291 --> 01:18:50,375
Abort! Abort!

1971
01:18:52,333 --> 01:18:54,041
No, no, no!

1972
01:18:54,208 --> 01:18:56,125
All units,
this is Detective Jaq Diallo.

1973
01:18:56,291 --> 01:18:57,250
As ranking officer,

1974
01:18:57,416 --> 01:18:58,833
I'm taking over
incident command.

1975
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:01,000
If he clears the bridge,
he'll turn back to Mercy.

1976
01:19:01,166 --> 01:19:02,875
Havelock,
send in the ordnance.

1977
01:19:03,041 --> 01:19:04,125
Take him out.

1978
01:19:04,291 --> 01:19:05,291
Wait, wait, wait.
No, no, no. What?

1979
01:19:05,458 --> 01:19:06,375
If he gets that bomb back

1980
01:19:06,541 --> 01:19:08,041
into a populated area,
he will destroy the...

1981
01:19:08,208 --> 01:19:09,083
Britt is in the truck,

1982
01:19:09,250 --> 01:19:10,125
and he's using her
as a shield!

1983
01:19:10,291 --> 01:19:11,166
Chris, any other day

1984
01:19:11,333 --> 01:19:12,791
you'd make the same call.
I'm sorry.

1985
01:19:12,958 --> 01:19:14,541
Jaq, you gotta call
Havelock off. Jaq?

1986
01:19:15,708 --> 01:19:17,083
No, no, no!

1987
01:19:18,500 --> 01:19:19,500
Get me on with Havelock.

1988
01:19:24,875 --> 01:19:26,208
You have a channel to him now.

1989
01:19:26,375 --> 01:19:27,958
Havelock,
it's Raven...

1990
01:19:28,125 --> 01:19:29,125
he's got my daughter in there.

1991
01:19:29,291 --> 01:19:30,833
I'm sorry, Detective.
I have my orders.

1992
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:32,166
It's the wrong move.

1993
01:19:32,333 --> 01:19:33,833
It's the wrong move
and you know it.

1994
01:19:34,791 --> 01:19:36,291
Havelock, send it now.

1995
01:19:36,458 --> 01:19:37,875
No, no, no!

1996
01:19:38,041 --> 01:19:39,291
Havelock, listen to me!

1997
01:19:39,458 --> 01:19:41,125
We've got the smartest judge
in the world here.

1998
01:19:41,291 --> 01:19:42,208
Let her make the call.

1999
01:19:42,375 --> 01:19:43,333
If he approaches
at sufficient speed...

2000
01:19:43,500 --> 01:19:44,750
everyone in this building

2001
01:19:44,916 --> 01:19:46,250
and in the truck
will be killed.

2002
01:19:46,416 --> 01:19:48,208
Please, Maddox. Maddox?

2003
01:19:48,375 --> 01:19:49,375
No.

2004
01:19:50,083 --> 01:19:51,250
Not Britt.

2005
01:19:51,416 --> 01:19:53,458
Chris, I should not
interfere with this.

2006
01:19:53,625 --> 01:19:55,041
Havelock, don't do it!

2007
01:20:01,416 --> 01:20:02,791
No!

2008
01:20:07,291 --> 01:20:08,708
- Shit!
- Misfire, misfire.

2009
01:20:08,875 --> 01:20:10,500
No detonation! No detonation!
Move out! Move out!

2010
01:20:10,666 --> 01:20:13,625
No detonation! Clear out!
Clear out! Get in! Get in!

2011
01:20:21,791 --> 01:20:23,083
Was that you?

2012
01:20:23,791 --> 01:20:25,375
We're all
out of options.

2013
01:20:25,541 --> 01:20:27,583
Chris, do you hear me?

2014
01:20:31,541 --> 01:20:33,333
He's turning back
towards Mercy.

2015
01:20:35,750 --> 01:20:36,833
He is
three minutes away.

2016
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:38,916
I'm gonna issue
an order to evacuate.

2017
01:20:39,083 --> 01:20:40,750
Please evacuate immediately.

2018
01:20:42,458 --> 01:20:44,333
Please evacuate immediately.

2019
01:20:44,500 --> 01:20:45,916
All teams, move in.

2020
01:20:46,083 --> 01:20:47,625
Please evacuate immediately.

2021
01:20:48,333 --> 01:20:49,708
Please evacuate immediately.

2022
01:20:49,875 --> 01:20:52,166
- Jaq, I need you.
- For what?

2023
01:20:52,333 --> 01:20:53,208
We're gonna
try talking to him.

2024
01:20:53,375 --> 01:20:54,541
Maddox, you with me?

2025
01:20:54,708 --> 01:20:55,625
Detective Diallo,

2026
01:20:55,791 --> 01:20:57,583
please put your air unit
in front of the truck.

2027
01:20:57,750 --> 01:21:00,000
I require the driver's face
on your camera.

2028
01:21:00,166 --> 01:21:01,833
Get as close as possible.

2029
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:03,000
Copy.

2030
01:21:08,500 --> 01:21:10,250
You are now live
on the base radio channel

2031
01:21:10,416 --> 01:21:11,500
he was listening to before.

2032
01:21:11,666 --> 01:21:12,958
Rob? Rob, you hear me?

2033
01:21:13,125 --> 01:21:14,625
- Hey, holy shit.
- It's Chris.

2034
01:21:14,791 --> 01:21:16,750
You're not gonna
talk me down, Chris.

2035
01:21:16,916 --> 01:21:17,916
- Dad, help! Help!
- Rob...

2036
01:21:18,083 --> 01:21:19,708
you can stop this.
You could let Britt go.

2037
01:21:19,875 --> 01:21:21,458
When you walked
into that AA meeting...

2038
01:21:21,625 --> 01:21:24,666
I knew exactly who you were.

2039
01:21:24,833 --> 01:21:26,916
You had been haunting
my dreams, Chris.

2040
01:21:27,083 --> 01:21:28,875
My brother had problems...

2041
01:21:29,041 --> 01:21:30,208
but I coulda helped him.

2042
01:21:30,375 --> 01:21:31,708
I coulda gotten him straight.

2043
01:21:31,875 --> 01:21:33,166
You started
all of this, man...

2044
01:21:33,333 --> 01:21:35,500
If it's about me
and the judge, why did you...

2045
01:21:35,666 --> 01:21:37,041
I needed you in that chair.

2046
01:21:37,208 --> 01:21:38,708
You had to suffer
in that chair,

2047
01:21:38,875 --> 01:21:39,916
knowing that
you were innocent.

2048
01:21:40,083 --> 01:21:42,166
- Same way that my brother did.
- Your brother was a murderer.

2049
01:21:42,333 --> 01:21:43,458
- No, he wasn't!
- Don't listen to him, Dad!

2050
01:21:43,625 --> 01:21:44,625
If he wasn't,
how do you think

2051
01:21:44,791 --> 01:21:45,750
that this helps him?

2052
01:21:45,916 --> 01:21:46,791
You're killing people
in his name.

2053
01:21:46,958 --> 01:21:47,791
Innocent people.

2054
01:21:47,958 --> 01:21:49,125
You think that's gonna
set things right?

2055
01:21:49,291 --> 01:21:51,583
No, no, no. I tried.
I called. I spoke to...

2056
01:21:51,750 --> 01:21:53,625
We can't let him
get away with this!

2057
01:21:53,791 --> 01:21:55,500
And she,
she told me that if I...

2058
01:21:55,666 --> 01:21:57,208
Shut your mouth!

2059
01:21:57,375 --> 01:21:58,625
Jaq! Was that...
What are you doing?

2060
01:21:58,791 --> 01:21:59,791
This is bullshit!

2061
01:21:59,958 --> 01:22:01,541
What do you think?
I had a shot, and I took it.

2062
01:22:01,708 --> 01:22:02,416
Britt is in the truck.

2063
01:22:03,250 --> 01:22:04,208
- Are you nuts?
- I said stop!

2064
01:22:10,041 --> 01:22:11,666
Oh, Jesus. Oh, God!

2065
01:22:25,833 --> 01:22:26,833
Power interrupted.

2066
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:29,000
- Backup battery activated.
- Maddox!

2067
01:22:29,166 --> 01:22:30,458
What the hell is happening?

2068
01:22:30,625 --> 01:22:31,875
Systems operating

2069
01:22:32,041 --> 01:22:34,708
at 40% efficiency.

2070
01:22:35,250 --> 01:22:37,291
Get me out of here! Maddox!

2071
01:22:38,500 --> 01:22:39,458
- Systems operating...
- Dad!

2072
01:22:39,625 --> 01:22:40,625
...at 40% efficiency.

2073
01:22:40,791 --> 01:22:41,625
- Britt.
- Efficiency.

2074
01:22:41,791 --> 01:22:43,000
- Maddox!
- Efficiency.

2075
01:22:43,166 --> 01:22:44,625
End the trial.
I have to get out there!

2076
01:22:44,791 --> 01:22:45,916
Move! Move!

2077
01:22:53,500 --> 01:22:54,666
This is
the Mercy Capital Court.

2078
01:22:54,833 --> 01:22:55,541
I'm Judge Maddox,

2079
01:22:55,708 --> 01:22:56,458
and I'm going
to preside over your...

2080
01:22:56,625 --> 01:22:58,625
Maddox! Maddox, end the trial.

2081
01:22:58,791 --> 01:23:00,666
I'm programmed
to remain online

2082
01:23:00,833 --> 01:23:02,625
until I stop
the trial recording.

2083
01:23:02,791 --> 01:23:04,791
And I still have
internal network access.

2084
01:23:05,416 --> 01:23:07,458
Christopher Raven
to the lobby.

2085
01:23:07,625 --> 01:23:08,833
Christopher Raven, you are...

2086
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:11,208
- Maddox! End the trial!
- ...wanted in the lobby.

2087
01:23:13,250 --> 01:23:14,250
Now.

2088
01:23:15,125 --> 01:23:16,125
Maddox!

2089
01:23:19,583 --> 01:23:21,208
I will assist you
however I can.

2090
01:23:25,291 --> 01:23:27,458
Please evacuate
the building.

2091
01:23:27,625 --> 01:23:29,625
Please evacuate immediately.

2092
01:23:29,791 --> 01:23:31,166
Please evacuate immediately.

2093
01:23:31,333 --> 01:23:33,541
Evacuate
the building quickly!

2094
01:23:33,708 --> 01:23:35,333
Please evacuate immediately.

2095
01:23:37,000 --> 01:23:38,083
Rob Nelson,

2096
01:23:38,250 --> 01:23:40,791
this is the LAPD
hostage negotiating team.

2097
01:23:42,083 --> 01:23:43,666
Come on. Talk to me, Rob.

2098
01:23:44,333 --> 01:23:45,875
No need for anybody
to get hurt here.

2099
01:23:46,041 --> 01:23:47,333
Chris!

2100
01:23:47,500 --> 01:23:49,833
- You got me, Maddox?
- Yep, I have you.

2101
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:51,208
We know
you have Britt Raven in there.

2102
01:23:51,375 --> 01:23:53,000
- Bring her on out, Rob.
- You got a visitor.

2103
01:23:53,166 --> 01:23:54,541
Can't do this, Rob!

2104
01:23:54,708 --> 01:23:56,125
About two years
I've been planning this!

2105
01:23:56,291 --> 01:23:57,625
Okay, wait.

2106
01:23:57,791 --> 01:23:58,875
Two years since you
put an innocent man

2107
01:23:59,041 --> 01:24:00,166
to death in that chair...

2108
01:24:00,333 --> 01:24:01,708
He wants to think
that his brother

2109
01:24:01,875 --> 01:24:03,208
was not a murderer, so...

2110
01:24:03,375 --> 01:24:05,166
give him an opportunity
to try to prove it...

2111
01:24:05,333 --> 01:24:07,208
and buy me some time
to figure a way out of this.

2112
01:24:07,375 --> 01:24:09,000
If I commence
an official court hearing...

2113
01:24:09,166 --> 01:24:09,916
to take his testimony

2114
01:24:10,083 --> 01:24:11,166
- on the record...
- Chris!

2115
01:24:11,333 --> 01:24:13,916
...I can bypass the firewall
and restore cloud access.

2116
01:24:14,083 --> 01:24:15,250
All right. Do it.

2117
01:24:15,416 --> 01:24:16,416
Nelson,
put the gun down.

2118
01:24:16,583 --> 01:24:18,083
Chris, get out here! Now!

2119
01:24:18,250 --> 01:24:19,291
- Dad!
- Okay!

2120
01:24:19,875 --> 01:24:21,416
- Dad! Please.
- It's okay!

2121
01:24:21,750 --> 01:24:24,000
It's okay! It's okay, kiddo.

2122
01:24:24,166 --> 01:24:25,875
I'm not gonna let anything
happen to you.

2123
01:24:26,041 --> 01:24:27,166
Let her go, Rob.

2124
01:24:27,333 --> 01:24:28,541
You can do anything
you want to me,

2125
01:24:28,708 --> 01:24:30,041
just... just let her go.

2126
01:24:31,250 --> 01:24:33,333
You said that
Nic was necessary.

2127
01:24:33,500 --> 01:24:35,000
Britt is not. You know it.

2128
01:24:35,166 --> 01:24:37,000
Shut up! It ends here.

2129
01:24:37,166 --> 01:24:40,500
You, the judge, this place,
and everything it stands for.

2130
01:24:40,666 --> 01:24:42,958
- Dad, he's got a bomb.
- No, he doesn't.

2131
01:24:43,500 --> 01:24:45,083
That bomb was working,
he'd have blown it.

2132
01:24:45,250 --> 01:24:46,416
He's just an angry man
with a gun.

2133
01:24:47,708 --> 01:24:51,416
What makes you think
that it's not workin'?

2134
01:24:51,583 --> 01:24:52,958
Dead-man switch.

2135
01:24:53,416 --> 01:24:54,333
Did you think
I was really gonna

2136
01:24:54,500 --> 01:24:55,666
blow this thing
before I made sure...

2137
01:24:55,833 --> 01:24:57,166
that you were
still in the building?

2138
01:24:58,083 --> 01:24:59,333
So, here's my verdict.

2139
01:24:59,500 --> 01:25:02,083
You're guilty of executing
an innocent man.

2140
01:25:03,083 --> 01:25:04,083
It's over.

2141
01:25:04,583 --> 01:25:06,041
No, no, no!

2142
01:25:06,416 --> 01:25:08,541
Mr. Nelson, I'm Judge Maddox.

2143
01:25:09,208 --> 01:25:10,875
You claim
your brother was innocent?

2144
01:25:11,708 --> 01:25:13,125
Before you destroy me
and this court

2145
01:25:13,291 --> 01:25:14,250
I suggest that...

2146
01:25:14,416 --> 01:25:15,291
- you put your case...
- What?

2147
01:25:15,458 --> 01:25:16,416
...on the record.

2148
01:25:16,583 --> 01:25:19,083
This is a chance for you
to clear your brother's name.

2149
01:25:19,250 --> 01:25:20,541
If you believe you can.

2150
01:25:20,708 --> 01:25:22,458
Of course, I can!
That's the point.

2151
01:25:22,625 --> 01:25:25,333
Then I, hereby, declare this
addendum evidence hearing...

2152
01:25:25,500 --> 01:25:27,791
in the trial of David Webb...
open.

2153
01:25:28,666 --> 01:25:29,875
Okay.

2154
01:25:31,000 --> 01:25:34,083
In that case, please. Proceed.

2155
01:25:34,541 --> 01:25:36,791
About two years ago,
I found him.

2156
01:25:36,958 --> 01:25:40,750
June 15th, Third and Hobart,
about four in the afternoon.

2157
01:25:40,916 --> 01:25:42,416
He was... all full of shame...

2158
01:25:42,583 --> 01:25:44,333
high out of his mind.
I was all shook up.

2159
01:25:45,375 --> 01:25:48,916
I gave him some cash and then
I gave him a phone so that...

2160
01:25:49,083 --> 01:25:51,958
I could call him
when I came up with a plan.

2161
01:25:52,125 --> 01:25:53,333
Next thing I know,

2162
01:25:53,500 --> 01:25:54,791
you're saying
he killed this lady.

2163
01:25:54,958 --> 01:25:56,041
But here's the thing,
I called him

2164
01:25:56,208 --> 01:25:57,833
the night of the murder!

2165
01:25:58,291 --> 01:26:00,375
Same time you said
he was killin' that lady...

2166
01:26:00,541 --> 01:26:01,875
I was talking to him!

2167
01:26:02,041 --> 01:26:03,125
- His detonator appears to...
- Okay?

2168
01:26:03,291 --> 01:26:04,291
...lack any arming mechanism.

2169
01:26:04,458 --> 01:26:05,250
Go on back and check
my cell phone records.

2170
01:26:05,416 --> 01:26:06,250
I know you got 'em.

2171
01:26:06,416 --> 01:26:07,291
There's an 82%
chance that...

2172
01:26:07,458 --> 01:26:08,291
...pulling the battery pack...

2173
01:26:08,458 --> 01:26:09,375
- Are you even listening?
- ...will render it inert

2174
01:26:09,541 --> 01:26:11,208
- without detonation.
- You are not listening to me!

2175
01:26:11,375 --> 01:26:12,291
I am listening very closely,

2176
01:26:12,458 --> 01:26:14,125
- Mr. Nelson.
- No.

2177
01:26:14,291 --> 01:26:15,208
The body of Valerie Bennett

2178
01:26:15,375 --> 01:26:18,041
was found in an underpass
at 6:00 a.m.

2179
01:26:18,208 --> 01:26:20,625
She had been stabbed to death
at approximately 10:00 p.m.

2180
01:26:20,791 --> 01:26:22,208
the night before.

2181
01:26:22,375 --> 01:26:24,166
Your brother
was found with her body...

2182
01:26:24,333 --> 01:26:25,833
with his prints
on the knife...

2183
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:27,541
and he did not have a phone.

2184
01:26:27,708 --> 01:26:28,791
No, I just told you.

2185
01:26:28,958 --> 01:26:31,333
I was on the phone with him
at 10:00 p.m.

2186
01:26:31,500 --> 01:26:33,250
We talked for over an hour!

2187
01:26:33,416 --> 01:26:34,833
You do not care
about the truth!

2188
01:26:35,000 --> 01:26:37,791
You are just a heartless
killing machine!

2189
01:26:37,958 --> 01:26:39,458
This place
is just a slaughterhouse!

2190
01:26:39,625 --> 01:26:40,625
I'm sorry,
Mr. Nelson.

2191
01:26:40,791 --> 01:26:41,583
Your evidence has failed

2192
01:26:41,750 --> 01:26:43,458
to reduce
the probability of guilt...

2193
01:26:43,625 --> 01:26:46,000
that led to
your brother's execution.

2194
01:26:46,541 --> 01:26:48,291
Britt!

2195
01:26:48,708 --> 01:26:49,583
No!

2196
01:26:51,916 --> 01:26:53,416
Dad!

2197
01:27:15,041 --> 01:27:16,041
On your knees!

2198
01:27:16,291 --> 01:27:17,291
Turn around!

2199
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:20,125
Chris! No. Don't.

2200
01:27:20,291 --> 01:27:21,416
He murdered Nic!

2201
01:27:21,750 --> 01:27:22,750
He's gonna pay.

2202
01:27:22,916 --> 01:27:24,291
Now, get up!

2203
01:27:27,333 --> 01:27:28,458
This doesn't fix anything.

2204
01:27:28,625 --> 01:27:31,208
- Shut your mouth.
- Dad, don't!

2205
01:27:31,375 --> 01:27:32,375
Please.

2206
01:27:37,875 --> 01:27:38,958
Dad!

2207
01:27:42,416 --> 01:27:43,458
Dad!

2208
01:27:45,500 --> 01:27:47,833
I was on the phone with him
the whole time, Chris.

2209
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:49,333
I called your precinct.

2210
01:27:53,041 --> 01:27:54,458
No, Jaq.
Not now! Nope!

2211
01:27:54,625 --> 01:27:56,041
- Let me finish this.
- No, Jaq!

2212
01:27:56,208 --> 01:27:57,500
Hey! Hey!

2213
01:27:58,291 --> 01:27:59,291
Back up. Okay.

2214
01:27:59,458 --> 01:28:01,666
- We're okay.
- I called the station.

2215
01:28:01,833 --> 01:28:04,416
I spoke to some lady,
and she told me...

2216
01:28:04,583 --> 01:28:08,125
that she would give me
a call back as soon... God!

2217
01:28:08,541 --> 01:28:10,166
Maddox, verify.

2218
01:28:10,750 --> 01:28:12,416
It was July 15th.

2219
01:28:15,375 --> 01:28:16,416
- Hello?
- Hey, buddy, it's me.

2220
01:28:16,583 --> 01:28:17,583
It's Rob.

2221
01:28:17,750 --> 01:28:18,666
Do you think
I can maybe crash

2222
01:28:18,833 --> 01:28:19,833
at your place for a while...

2223
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:21,208
just till I get back
on my feet?

2224
01:28:21,375 --> 01:28:23,125
Of course.
Anything you need.

2225
01:28:23,291 --> 01:28:24,291
I'm always here for you.

2226
01:28:24,458 --> 01:28:26,458
I told a woman
at the precinct

2227
01:28:26,625 --> 01:28:28,541
to check my call history!

2228
01:28:28,708 --> 01:28:30,666
Whoever booked him
knows what happened.

2229
01:28:30,833 --> 01:28:32,375
Wait...

2230
01:28:32,541 --> 01:28:34,291
do you know if someone
called about an alibi?

2231
01:28:36,583 --> 01:28:37,625
Did you know?

2232
01:28:37,791 --> 01:28:38,750
I was trying
to get through

2233
01:28:38,916 --> 01:28:40,083
to someone the whole time!

2234
01:28:40,250 --> 01:28:41,416
No one would listen!

2235
01:28:42,833 --> 01:28:45,208
You processed Webb.
Did he have a cell phone?

2236
01:28:46,041 --> 01:28:47,041
- Jaq?
- Stop.

2237
01:28:47,416 --> 01:28:49,458
- You need to hear me, Chris.
- You took him in, Jaq.

2238
01:28:49,625 --> 01:28:51,375
I have tracked the cell phone.

2239
01:28:51,541 --> 01:28:54,083
It was at the scene
when David Webb was arrested.

2240
01:28:54,250 --> 01:28:55,666
Then at the station.

2241
01:28:56,375 --> 01:28:58,000
Maddox,
bypass the LAPD firewall

2242
01:28:58,166 --> 01:28:59,541
with my login.

2243
01:29:01,208 --> 01:29:02,208
Don't do this.

2244
01:29:02,375 --> 01:29:04,208
Check
the evidence room.

2245
01:29:04,375 --> 01:29:05,666
And show me Jaq's bodycam.

2246
01:29:12,083 --> 01:29:13,291
Phone tracking
records show

2247
01:29:13,416 --> 01:29:15,708
the phone in the evidence room
at this time.

2248
01:29:15,875 --> 01:29:17,500
But it wasn't processed.

2249
01:29:17,666 --> 01:29:18,833
Why is it missing,
Jaq?

2250
01:29:23,791 --> 01:29:25,958
Did you drive straight home
that night, Jaq,

2251
01:29:26,125 --> 01:29:27,250
or should we check?

2252
01:29:27,708 --> 01:29:28,708
Maddox?

2253
01:29:46,291 --> 01:29:48,125
You buried the phone.

2254
01:29:48,666 --> 01:29:50,708
We needed the first trial
to be a home run.

2255
01:29:51,958 --> 01:29:53,500
We need Mercy, Chris.

2256
01:29:54,875 --> 01:29:56,750
We need these scumbags scared.

2257
01:29:56,916 --> 01:29:58,375
Look at what it's done for us.

2258
01:29:59,375 --> 01:30:02,208
You'd destroy it all
if this gets out.

2259
01:30:03,291 --> 01:30:04,750
We need justice, Jaq.

2260
01:30:05,958 --> 01:30:07,166
Not this.

2261
01:30:14,166 --> 01:30:15,916
Detain Detective Diallo
and Robert Nelson.

2262
01:30:16,083 --> 01:30:16,958
Let's go.

2263
01:30:17,125 --> 01:30:18,083
Let's move on out, guys.

2264
01:30:18,250 --> 01:30:19,708
Get up. On your feet.

2265
01:30:19,875 --> 01:30:22,583
- Dad.
- Britt, hey. Hey.

2266
01:30:22,750 --> 01:30:24,958
You're okay. You're okay.

2267
01:30:25,125 --> 01:30:26,708
- Hey, are you hurt?
- No.

2268
01:30:26,875 --> 01:30:29,250
- Are you sure?
- Yeah. I'm okay.

2269
01:30:31,208 --> 01:30:32,666
I'm sorry, Dad.

2270
01:30:33,458 --> 01:30:35,291
I'm sorry I ever thought
you could hurt Mom.

2271
01:30:35,458 --> 01:30:36,958
I got you. I got you.

2272
01:30:38,166 --> 01:30:39,708
I'm not going anywhere.

2273
01:30:49,541 --> 01:30:50,541
Chris...

2274
01:30:54,458 --> 01:30:56,166
What have we done?

2275
01:30:58,750 --> 01:31:00,416
We just did what
we're programmed to do.

2276
01:31:02,666 --> 01:31:05,000
Human or AI.

2277
01:31:07,458 --> 01:31:08,875
We all make mistakes...

2278
01:31:11,458 --> 01:31:13,291
and we learn.

2279
01:31:18,541 --> 01:31:20,000
Yes, we do.

2280
01:31:27,625 --> 01:31:28,625
Maddox?
