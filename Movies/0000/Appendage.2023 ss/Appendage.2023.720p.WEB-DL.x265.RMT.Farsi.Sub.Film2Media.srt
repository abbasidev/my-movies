1
00:00:33,034 --> 00:00:34,952
- On getting a
new piece. - Hmm.

2
00:00:34,953 --> 00:00:36,745
I think
it's gonna happen,

3
00:00:36,746 --> 00:00:38,455
so I'm very excited.

4
00:00:38,456 --> 00:00:40,083
I can't wait for you to see it.

5
00:00:41,877 --> 00:00:43,670
Is this that one
coming out of Amsterdam?

6
00:00:43,670 --> 00:00:44,754
Mm-hmm.

7
00:00:45,338 --> 00:00:47,423
Nice.
Gorgeous, gorgeous sculpture.

8
00:00:47,424 --> 00:00:48,592
Oh, my God.

9
00:00:50,343 --> 00:00:51,703
Congratulations,
sweetheart.

10
00:00:58,310 --> 00:01:01,270
Don't
embarrass yourself, sweetie.

11
00:01:11,489 --> 00:01:12,991
Oh,
um, we need to remember

12
00:01:12,991 --> 00:01:15,284
to go through the shed
before the movers get here.

13
00:01:15,285 --> 00:01:16,660
Oh, yeah, right.

14
00:01:33,511 --> 00:01:35,347
Pass the taters, Han.

15
00:01:41,436 --> 00:01:42,270
Hannah?

16
00:01:43,188 --> 00:01:44,231
Uh, yeah.

17
00:01:45,023 --> 00:01:46,190
They're really great, Mom.

18
00:02:42,205 --> 00:02:44,249
You fuck-up.

19
00:02:47,502 --> 00:02:48,420
Come on, babe.

20
00:02:49,462 --> 00:02:50,881
It's getting late.

21
00:02:51,339 --> 00:02:52,715
Let's go to bed.

22
00:02:52,716 --> 00:02:54,676
I'm coming, just two minutes.

23
00:02:56,386 --> 00:02:57,554
Okay.

24
00:03:13,945 --> 00:03:15,738
Oh, it's so early.

25
00:03:15,739 --> 00:03:17,114
No.

26
00:03:17,115 --> 00:03:18,532
Just stay.

27
00:03:18,533 --> 00:03:20,534
I have to start my day.

28
00:03:20,535 --> 00:03:22,037
- No, you don't.
- I do.

29
00:03:26,499 --> 00:03:27,542
Good morning.

30
00:03:30,962 --> 00:03:31,963
It's early.

31
00:03:33,048 --> 00:03:34,674
Oh, now you say it's
early.

32
00:03:53,818 --> 00:03:55,027
Oh, my God, pancakes?

33
00:03:55,028 --> 00:03:58,281
Mm-hmm. Maybe you'll get some
bacon, too, if you're lucky.

34
00:03:58,698 --> 00:04:00,449
If I'm lucky? KAELIN: Yeah.

35
00:04:00,450 --> 00:04:02,410
- Hey, you got a little...
- Wh... Oh, shit.

36
00:04:02,994 --> 00:04:04,912
Saving some for later.

37
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:21,513
Babe, you okay?

38
00:04:24,057 --> 00:04:25,724
Yeah.

39
00:04:25,725 --> 00:04:27,561
You actually need to get
some rest tonight, alright?

40
00:04:27,561 --> 00:04:28,395
I will.

41
00:04:35,902 --> 00:04:37,069
Hey, what...

42
00:04:37,070 --> 00:04:39,114
Where you going?
Pancakes, bacon?

43
00:04:39,614 --> 00:04:42,116
Cristeàn moved
crits to 8:00 a.m.

44
00:04:47,372 --> 00:04:50,250
Hey, will you, uh, lock
up on your way out?

45
00:04:51,459 --> 00:04:54,629
You know, with the keys I
gave you to my apartment?

46
00:04:55,422 --> 00:04:56,548
Yeah, I can do that.

47
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:06,473
Ah, shit.

48
00:05:31,333 --> 00:05:33,083
'Sup, bitch?

49
00:05:33,084 --> 00:05:34,669
'Sup, baby doll?

50
00:05:37,005 --> 00:05:38,964
I was on the subway this morning

51
00:05:38,965 --> 00:05:41,592
and I saw this woman violently
threading her chin hair

52
00:05:41,593 --> 00:05:42,968
without a mirror.

53
00:05:42,969 --> 00:05:45,095
I need to get on that level,

54
00:05:45,096 --> 00:05:46,347
and I'm gonna practice on you.

55
00:05:46,348 --> 00:05:49,183
It'll be way better than when I
tweezed your eyebrows, I swear.

56
00:05:49,184 --> 00:05:50,017
No way, Esther.

57
00:05:50,018 --> 00:05:51,061
How am I gonna
be a professional

58
00:05:51,061 --> 00:05:52,269
without you helping me?

59
00:05:53,104 --> 00:05:56,358
Um, okay, this
button is gorgeous.

60
00:05:56,816 --> 00:05:58,235
I can't track
his taste though.

61
00:05:58,235 --> 00:06:01,863
It's, like, up to the narcissistic
personality disorder gods.

62
00:06:04,532 --> 00:06:06,826
I just want it to be perfect.

63
00:06:11,498 --> 00:06:13,082
Oh, shit!

64
00:06:13,083 --> 00:06:13,999
What?

65
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,668
I bled on this.

66
00:06:15,669 --> 00:06:18,087
Blood? Maybe he won't notice?

67
00:06:18,088 --> 00:06:19,880
He will, he's a droid.

68
00:06:19,881 --> 00:06:21,882
Okay, he's a droid, but
just like make it fashion.

69
00:06:27,347 --> 00:06:28,807
Gather your things.

70
00:06:35,647 --> 00:06:36,807
It'll be fine.

71
00:06:40,819 --> 00:06:43,863
Now... what I

72
00:06:45,115 --> 00:06:49,618
lovingly call my Season Picks
are at this month's end.

73
00:06:49,619 --> 00:06:53,581
I will select a few of you

74
00:06:53,582 --> 00:06:56,625
to work on my spring
collection officially,

75
00:06:56,626 --> 00:06:58,461
pending your work.

76
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:02,965
Now, I will not
hesitate to let you go.

77
00:07:02,966 --> 00:07:08,471
Now is the time to
apply... pressure.

78
00:07:13,685 --> 00:07:14,769
No.

79
00:07:15,645 --> 00:07:20,483
From this point forward, consider
your off hours, on hours.

80
00:07:22,903 --> 00:07:24,570
I think we could
make the frame work,

81
00:07:24,571 --> 00:07:28,199
but the stitching is horrendous.

82
00:07:28,950 --> 00:07:31,076
Hello? Hello?

83
00:07:31,077 --> 00:07:32,536
Is that thing on?

84
00:07:35,415 --> 00:07:36,833
Let's keep it.

85
00:07:38,293 --> 00:07:39,377
Rework the stitching.

86
00:07:39,878 --> 00:07:41,170
Stitch it up.

87
00:07:43,340 --> 00:07:46,551
Hannah banana.

88
00:07:47,302 --> 00:07:50,222
Hmm. Pasta sauce?

89
00:07:52,224 --> 00:07:56,101
Oh, wow, um, I must have
pricked my stupid finger and...

90
00:07:56,102 --> 00:07:57,269
Never mind that.

91
00:07:57,270 --> 00:07:59,356
D'Armitage did a...

92
00:08:00,482 --> 00:08:02,107
wrap dress last season.

93
00:08:02,108 --> 00:08:04,818
Oh, I know, but this,
um, it actually buttons.

94
00:08:04,819 --> 00:08:06,446
It doesn't tie.

95
00:08:08,031 --> 00:08:10,449
You know what you
have? It's, um...

96
00:08:10,450 --> 00:08:11,492
Oh, what's it called?

97
00:08:11,493 --> 00:08:13,786
It-it-It's, it's a
very, very good word.

98
00:08:13,787 --> 00:08:15,162
Um...
- Finesse or...

99
00:08:15,163 --> 00:08:16,997
- No. Um...
- Panache?

100
00:08:16,998 --> 00:08:19,667
No, no.
It's-it's, um, um, um,

101
00:08:19,668 --> 00:08:22,461
it's-it's like when you
think that you came up

102
00:08:22,462 --> 00:08:25,506
with a totally original
idea, like now,

103
00:08:25,507 --> 00:08:28,342
but in actuality,
you fuckin' stole it

104
00:08:28,343 --> 00:08:30,010
from someone else.

105
00:08:38,311 --> 00:08:39,144
Ugh.

106
00:08:56,621 --> 00:09:00,249
Oh, my God. What the fuck?

107
00:09:02,669 --> 00:09:04,545
Han? You okay, babe?

108
00:09:04,546 --> 00:09:05,672
Uh...

109
00:09:06,715 --> 00:09:08,841
Yeah, yeah, it just
feels like a morning star

110
00:09:08,842 --> 00:09:10,510
is being dragged
through my uterus.

111
00:09:11,636 --> 00:09:13,305
God, that
sounds awful.

112
00:09:14,598 --> 00:09:16,807
Yeah, do you have,
um, Ibuprofen or...

113
00:09:16,808 --> 00:09:18,435
Yeah, I got you.

114
00:09:19,102 --> 00:09:21,187
Our cycles are synced, bitch.

115
00:09:22,439 --> 00:09:24,024
- Thanks, angel.
- Here you go.

116
00:09:24,024 --> 00:09:25,441
Of course. I gotta pee.

117
00:09:25,442 --> 00:09:26,568
Okay.

118
00:09:28,695 --> 00:09:30,029
Also for the record,

119
00:09:30,030 --> 00:09:31,780
you buttoned your wrap dress?

120
00:09:31,781 --> 00:09:33,782
It is absolutely
fucking different.

121
00:09:33,783 --> 00:09:35,701
It's fine, at least
he liked yours.

122
00:09:35,702 --> 00:09:37,786
Cristeàn is a sadist.

123
00:09:37,787 --> 00:09:39,872
Full-on, goddamn sadist.

124
00:09:45,503 --> 00:09:46,755
Let's get drunk.

125
00:09:47,714 --> 00:09:49,006
Shots!

126
00:09:49,007 --> 00:09:50,091
Shots.

127
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:52,635
- Shots.
- I'm down.

128
00:09:52,636 --> 00:09:54,178
Oh, and
more importantly,

129
00:09:54,179 --> 00:09:56,013
I have a really fun
idea to pitch you.

130
00:09:56,014 --> 00:09:56,972
A pitch?

131
00:09:56,973 --> 00:09:57,973
I'm on board.

132
00:09:57,974 --> 00:09:59,391
Okay, tonight?

133
00:09:59,392 --> 00:10:01,311
Oh, I can't tonight, I'm
going to Kaelin's place.

134
00:10:01,311 --> 00:10:02,144
Oh.

135
00:10:02,145 --> 00:10:04,355
Yeah, he wants to show
me something special.

136
00:10:04,356 --> 00:10:06,315
Special,
what the fuck?

137
00:10:06,316 --> 00:10:07,691
Like his dick? Like, "Oh yeah!"

138
00:10:07,692 --> 00:10:08,776
Shh!

139
00:10:08,777 --> 00:10:09,778
Whoa, whoa.

140
00:10:10,445 --> 00:10:11,821
Shh.

141
00:10:12,489 --> 00:10:13,656
Oh, my God, though,

142
00:10:13,657 --> 00:10:15,616
I knew you two would hit
off when I intro'd you

143
00:10:15,617 --> 00:10:18,661
because Kaelin and I
are very connected.

144
00:10:18,662 --> 00:10:19,954
He tells me everything...

145
00:10:19,955 --> 00:10:22,831
and he
is very happy with you.

146
00:10:22,832 --> 00:10:25,584
I'm like
matchmaking auntie times ten.

147
00:10:25,585 --> 00:10:27,878
Yeah.

148
00:10:27,879 --> 00:10:28,921
Special. Yeah!

149
00:10:28,922 --> 00:10:30,966
Yeah!
- Oh, my God. I'm leaving.

150
00:10:38,598 --> 00:10:39,848
You're a rump roast.

151
00:10:39,849 --> 00:10:41,892
No. You just said rump roast.

152
00:10:41,893 --> 00:10:43,143
I did say rump roast.

153
00:10:43,144 --> 00:10:45,062
Okay,
we'll start again.

154
00:10:45,063 --> 00:10:46,397
Let's go.

155
00:10:46,398 --> 00:10:48,233
Oh.

156
00:10:53,572 --> 00:10:56,490
So it's not exactly what I was
expecting when you said, "Special."

157
00:10:56,491 --> 00:10:57,784
What's the deal?

158
00:10:58,493 --> 00:11:02,037
Um, well, my mom came
up with this game

159
00:11:02,038 --> 00:11:05,624
when I was a kid...
right before she died,

160
00:11:05,625 --> 00:11:08,086
when she was, uh, still sick.

161
00:11:10,922 --> 00:11:11,923
Yeah.

162
00:11:13,091 --> 00:11:16,761
It was fun. It, um, it helped
us process stuff, you know.

163
00:11:17,345 --> 00:11:18,680
Let us open up, I guess.

164
00:11:20,056 --> 00:11:23,977
So, yeah, I just
wanted to share it.

165
00:11:25,687 --> 00:11:28,398
I know she meant a lot to
you. She seemed really cool.

166
00:11:46,583 --> 00:11:48,125
Whoa! You okay?

167
00:11:55,008 --> 00:11:55,884
Ugh.

168
00:11:56,968 --> 00:11:59,011
Um, I have to go. I'm sorry.

169
00:11:59,012 --> 00:12:01,305
Right now? Uh, did
I do something?

170
00:12:01,306 --> 00:12:02,432
No, no, it's just...

171
00:12:03,725 --> 00:12:06,185
Um, Cristeàn, he said that
he would fire us today

172
00:12:06,186 --> 00:12:08,313
if we didn't step up, so, um...

173
00:12:13,318 --> 00:12:14,945
I'm sorry, Kaelin.

174
00:13:06,871 --> 00:13:09,541
D'Armitage did a
wrap last season.

175
00:13:10,083 --> 00:13:13,377
You're an unoriginal
piece of shit.

176
00:13:16,047 --> 00:13:17,339
What did you say?

177
00:13:17,340 --> 00:13:19,466
You heard me.

178
00:13:19,467 --> 00:13:20,968
This isn't real.
This isn't real.

179
00:13:20,969 --> 00:13:22,011
Oh, God.

180
00:13:22,012 --> 00:13:23,596
It's real, bitch.

181
00:13:26,016 --> 00:13:27,474
What are you looking for?

182
00:13:27,475 --> 00:13:30,811
An idea? You have
no good ideas.

183
00:13:30,812 --> 00:13:32,897
You're a talentless fuck-up.

184
00:13:32,898 --> 00:13:34,273
Shut up, that's not true.

185
00:13:34,274 --> 00:13:36,525
You can't
even sew a button

186
00:13:36,526 --> 00:13:38,736
without pricking
your stupid finger.

187
00:13:38,737 --> 00:13:40,946
You're fuckin' stupid.

188
00:13:40,947 --> 00:13:41,906
Dig deeper.

189
00:13:41,907 --> 00:13:44,783
Dig into your fucked-up head.

190
00:13:51,166 --> 00:13:52,249
Ow!

191
00:14:02,469 --> 00:14:03,887
Oh, that feels good.

192
00:14:39,506 --> 00:14:40,339
Boo, bitch.

193
00:14:50,559 --> 00:14:52,143
It can't be real.

194
00:14:53,353 --> 00:14:54,646
It's not real.

195
00:14:57,232 --> 00:14:58,691
It's not real.

196
00:15:45,906 --> 00:15:47,698
It's dark in here.

197
00:15:47,699 --> 00:15:49,450
Let me out.

198
00:15:53,663 --> 00:15:56,333
Somebody got laid last night.

199
00:15:58,043 --> 00:16:01,338
Ah. The pitter-patter
of Hannah banana.

200
00:16:03,048 --> 00:16:04,883
Better not be a wrap dress.

201
00:16:06,301 --> 00:16:07,677
It's
original this time.

202
00:16:24,527 --> 00:16:26,738
A red dye.

203
00:16:29,366 --> 00:16:30,659
Beading.

204
00:16:35,330 --> 00:16:38,540
It's... twisted,

205
00:16:38,541 --> 00:16:41,919
sexy, eccentric.

206
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:45,340
Whatever you're tapping into...

207
00:16:47,008 --> 00:16:48,385
it's clearly working.

208
00:16:49,844 --> 00:16:52,472
Keep it going.

209
00:16:53,348 --> 00:16:55,015
Thank you, I will.

210
00:16:55,016 --> 00:16:57,726
Ari, put it with the yeses.

211
00:17:05,193 --> 00:17:06,069
Yes!

212
00:17:12,450 --> 00:17:13,450
Oh, my God!

213
00:17:13,451 --> 00:17:16,203
Oh, yes, yes, yes,
yes, yes, bitch!

214
00:17:16,204 --> 00:17:18,497
Let's fuckin' go!

215
00:17:18,498 --> 00:17:20,499
I just have to
push for a few more weeks,

216
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:21,876
then I'll be fine.

217
00:17:23,628 --> 00:17:26,547
Oh, my God. Hannah, what
the fuck? Are you okay?

218
00:17:26,548 --> 00:17:29,008
Oh, yeah. No, that's
just this allergy thing.

219
00:17:29,009 --> 00:17:30,843
Um, It's so gross, I know,

220
00:17:30,844 --> 00:17:32,970
but I'm going to the
dermatologist at lunch.

221
00:17:32,971 --> 00:17:34,972
That looks like
a fuckin' jelly donut.

222
00:17:34,973 --> 00:17:35,932
What the fuck?

223
00:17:36,933 --> 00:17:39,226
Um, do you wanna
do drinks later?

224
00:17:39,227 --> 00:17:41,646
Sounds good, right?
- Yeah, we'll do... drinks.

225
00:17:44,816 --> 00:17:47,151
Let's
see. Can you just move...

226
00:17:47,152 --> 00:17:49,278
Um, move like a little bit...

227
00:17:49,279 --> 00:17:51,071
There we go, there we go.

228
00:17:51,072 --> 00:17:54,241
Oof. Hmm. Any allergies?

229
00:17:54,242 --> 00:17:55,826
Not that I'm aware of, no.

230
00:17:55,827 --> 00:17:58,621
Well, it could be eczema,
but it's quite severe.

231
00:17:58,622 --> 00:17:59,788
It's painful?

232
00:17:59,789 --> 00:18:00,623
Mm-hmm.

233
00:18:00,624 --> 00:18:02,167
Did
you eat any new food,

234
00:18:02,167 --> 00:18:05,002
use any new soap, shampoo,
conditioner, moisturizer?

235
00:18:05,003 --> 00:18:06,128
Okay.

236
00:18:06,129 --> 00:18:08,924
Well, I'm gonna run a blood panel to
test for allergies just to be safe.

237
00:18:08,924 --> 00:18:12,218
Have you ever seen anything
like this before, or...

238
00:18:12,219 --> 00:18:14,511
Oh, I've seen plenty of
severe skin reactions,

239
00:18:14,512 --> 00:18:16,181
but you're saying you
haven't changed your routine.

240
00:18:16,181 --> 00:18:17,682
Could it be anything else?

241
00:18:20,393 --> 00:18:22,895
Centralized
on the birthmark.

242
00:18:22,896 --> 00:18:24,605
I don't love speculation,

243
00:18:24,606 --> 00:18:27,484
but there's some likelihood
you are a human chimera.

244
00:18:28,568 --> 00:18:29,736
I'm a monster.

245
00:18:30,278 --> 00:18:32,196
No, it's a
reductive way to say

246
00:18:32,197 --> 00:18:35,449
you likely have dual DNA
from vanishing twin syndrome.

247
00:18:35,450 --> 00:18:37,118
Huh.
That's probably why

248
00:18:37,118 --> 00:18:38,661
you got this birthmark.

249
00:18:38,662 --> 00:18:40,621
I mean, it's inconsequential,

250
00:18:40,622 --> 00:18:43,874
but it could cause extra
sensitivity on your birthmark.

251
00:18:43,875 --> 00:18:45,417
I'm sorry, I'm-I'm
not following.

252
00:18:45,418 --> 00:18:49,463
Oh, dual DNA is usually caused from
absorbing your twin in the womb.

253
00:18:49,464 --> 00:18:50,798
It's not so uncommon.

254
00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:52,551
I mean, we see it with
birthmarks like yours.

255
00:18:52,551 --> 00:18:55,219
So I'm gonna prescribe
you cortisone ointment

256
00:18:55,220 --> 00:18:58,515
and an antihistamine,
so avoid sunlight.

257
00:19:00,475 --> 00:19:01,726
This is a crazy question.

258
00:19:03,979 --> 00:19:05,981
But can your twin grow back?

259
00:19:07,107 --> 00:19:08,942
No.

260
00:19:09,526 --> 00:19:11,361
Um, let me know if it does.

261
00:19:14,823 --> 00:19:15,949
Yeah.

262
00:19:41,641 --> 00:19:43,518
Get it, get it, get it,
get it, get it. Get it, get it.

263
00:19:44,728 --> 00:19:46,020
Thank you.

264
00:19:46,021 --> 00:19:47,479
Oh, my God!

265
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:48,981
I don't wanna.

266
00:19:48,982 --> 00:19:50,232
Yeah, you have to.

267
00:19:50,233 --> 00:19:52,277
One, two, three.

268
00:19:56,197 --> 00:19:57,990
Swallow. Swallow it. Swallow it.

269
00:19:57,991 --> 00:19:59,033
No!

270
00:20:01,578 --> 00:20:03,245
Oh, my God, I just
like spit on myself.

271
00:20:03,246 --> 00:20:05,748
You just have to not think
about it and pretend it's water.

272
00:20:05,749 --> 00:20:07,625
This is not water.

273
00:20:07,626 --> 00:20:09,127
You want another? ESTHER:
Are you fucking kidding me?

274
00:20:09,127 --> 00:20:11,045
I will projectile
vomit onto your face.

275
00:20:11,046 --> 00:20:12,631
Have you seen The Exorcist?

276
00:20:13,590 --> 00:20:15,090
Oh, my God, speaking
of gross shit,

277
00:20:15,091 --> 00:20:17,551
that like skin allergy
jelly donut thing,

278
00:20:17,552 --> 00:20:19,011
you should get that fixed.

279
00:20:19,012 --> 00:20:20,639
I honestly think you
should let me check it out.

280
00:20:20,639 --> 00:20:22,097
Oh, hey, hey, hey, hey!

281
00:20:22,098 --> 00:20:23,390
The pitch thing.

282
00:20:23,391 --> 00:20:24,392
The pitch, tell me your pitch.

283
00:20:24,392 --> 00:20:25,601
Yes, the pitch, bitch.

284
00:20:25,602 --> 00:20:26,977
Okay, yes, give me like...

285
00:20:26,978 --> 00:20:28,020
Okay, a fuckin' drum roll.

286
00:20:31,024 --> 00:20:34,444
What if you and I

287
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:37,571
start our own fashion line?

288
00:20:37,572 --> 00:20:40,157
You mean like quit?

289
00:20:40,158 --> 00:20:41,368
Yeah.

290
00:20:42,452 --> 00:20:44,079
What about
Season Picks?

291
00:20:44,746 --> 00:20:48,040
Fuck Cristeàn's
Season Pick bullshit.

292
00:20:48,041 --> 00:20:49,625
And we just do us.

293
00:20:49,626 --> 00:20:51,919
We could live in the burbs
and rent would be cheaper,

294
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:53,587
we could work out
of our own home.

295
00:20:53,588 --> 00:20:56,674
Have like a little countryside cottage
where we drink tea every morning.

296
00:20:56,675 --> 00:20:58,051
Oh, my gosh. We can wear
what the fuck we want.

297
00:20:58,051 --> 00:21:00,135
It could be like G-strings.
You know what I mean?

298
00:21:00,136 --> 00:21:04,348
Like, bring the G-string back.
It'll be so much fun, you know.

299
00:21:04,349 --> 00:21:07,768
Okay, okay, but like,
ugh, shut up, phone.

300
00:21:07,769 --> 00:21:10,771
So, alright,
I'm thinking robes,

301
00:21:10,772 --> 00:21:12,690
I'm thinking dresses.

302
00:21:12,691 --> 00:21:14,567
I'm
thinking lingerie.

303
00:21:14,568 --> 00:21:16,235
Fuckin' fly and fresh.

304
00:21:16,236 --> 00:21:18,862
We could have like, like...

305
00:21:18,863 --> 00:21:20,743
We'll be hustling all the
time, and then like...

306
00:21:38,425 --> 00:21:40,093
Uh, I have a headache.

307
00:21:41,636 --> 00:21:44,513
Just... I think
I'm gonna head out.

308
00:21:44,514 --> 00:21:46,098
Wait, no. Wait,
what? Where you g...

309
00:21:46,099 --> 00:21:48,392
What? Han?

310
00:23:04,177 --> 00:23:08,347
Uh-oh, Kaelin is texting Esther

311
00:23:08,348 --> 00:23:10,766
and ignoring you.

312
00:23:10,767 --> 00:23:12,142
Makes sense.

313
00:23:12,143 --> 00:23:15,854
You left him alone when he
opened up about his dead mom.

314
00:23:15,855 --> 00:23:19,358
What kind of shitty
girlfriend are you?

315
00:23:19,359 --> 00:23:22,152
Of course, he'd
rather talk to Esther.

316
00:23:22,153 --> 00:23:24,780
They're connected,
like she said.

317
00:23:24,781 --> 00:23:26,490
You can't connect with anyone.

318
00:23:26,491 --> 00:23:29,660
You're a self-obsessed,
pathetic freak.

319
00:23:29,661 --> 00:23:31,788
I know you very well.

320
00:23:32,664 --> 00:23:33,999
I'll protect you.

321
00:23:34,958 --> 00:23:38,044
I inspired the dress, didn't I?

322
00:23:41,006 --> 00:23:43,007
Keep an eye on them.

323
00:23:43,008 --> 00:23:45,385
Something is going
on between them.

324
00:24:55,830 --> 00:24:58,416
You can't get rid of me.

325
00:25:00,377 --> 00:25:04,630
No matter how hard you try.

326
00:25:49,175 --> 00:25:50,009
Hello.

327
00:25:50,010 --> 00:25:52,137
Oh, my God, you
picked up the phone.

328
00:25:52,637 --> 00:25:54,471
What is this not
calling me back thing?

329
00:25:54,472 --> 00:25:55,974
I've had knots in my stomach.

330
00:25:57,142 --> 00:25:58,476
Uh, sorry.

331
00:25:59,728 --> 00:26:02,314
Yeah, things have just been
crazy busy with, uh, work.

332
00:26:02,939 --> 00:26:04,774
It's actually going really
well right now, Mom.

333
00:26:07,110 --> 00:26:08,277
Oh. Okay.

334
00:26:08,278 --> 00:26:10,529
Uh, well, Dad is on call busy

335
00:26:10,530 --> 00:26:13,616
and I finally acquired that
sculpture for the gallery.

336
00:26:13,617 --> 00:26:14,868
Was I a twin?

337
00:26:15,660 --> 00:26:17,245
Why?

338
00:26:17,871 --> 00:26:19,247
What is this about?

339
00:26:19,998 --> 00:26:22,791
That's such a strange
question to ask me.

340
00:26:22,792 --> 00:26:24,543
What is wrong with you?

341
00:26:24,544 --> 00:26:26,171
Never mind, it's nothing.

342
00:26:27,631 --> 00:26:28,590
Are you PMSing?

343
00:26:29,090 --> 00:26:30,007
Probably.

344
00:26:30,008 --> 00:26:32,134
Well,
I'm really calling

345
00:26:32,135 --> 00:26:34,762
because we're gonna do a big
goodbye dinner before our move.

346
00:26:34,763 --> 00:26:37,891
The Goldblums, the Kowalskis,
everyone will be there.

347
00:26:38,808 --> 00:26:41,168
Goodbye dinner? You're practically
moving down the street.

348
00:26:42,354 --> 00:26:43,854
Well... yeah.

349
00:26:43,855 --> 00:26:45,315
I-I know it won't be far.

350
00:26:46,233 --> 00:26:48,443
I'm not as much of an
idiot as you think I am.

351
00:26:49,319 --> 00:26:51,278
Anyway, 15 people are coming

352
00:26:51,279 --> 00:26:53,072
and it's next month on the 4th.

353
00:26:53,073 --> 00:26:54,907
You really should be there.

354
00:26:54,908 --> 00:26:56,116
Mm-hmm. Yeah.

355
00:26:56,117 --> 00:26:57,826
Great and, um,

356
00:26:57,827 --> 00:27:00,455
maybe while you're here, you
could go through your things.

357
00:27:01,665 --> 00:27:03,250
It's all high school stuff.

358
00:27:03,917 --> 00:27:07,546
Let's get rid of it all so we
can focus on happier memories.

359
00:27:10,507 --> 00:27:13,092
You know what? Uh,
sorry, Mom, I gotta go.

360
00:27:13,093 --> 00:27:14,510
Um, okay.

361
00:27:14,511 --> 00:27:16,111
Well, uh, pick up the
phone when I call.

362
00:27:29,317 --> 00:27:31,485
Surprise!

363
00:27:31,486 --> 00:27:32,653
Hey, hey, hey!

364
00:27:32,654 --> 00:27:36,657
We're here to sweep you up and
take you on a picnic brunch.

365
00:27:36,658 --> 00:27:37,908
Yes, yes, yes.

366
00:27:37,909 --> 00:27:39,410
Fire. Fire snacks.

367
00:27:39,411 --> 00:27:40,828
Fire snacks.

368
00:27:50,380 --> 00:27:52,923
You okay,
babe? You look kinda sick.

369
00:27:52,924 --> 00:27:54,259
We drank
way too much last night.

370
00:27:54,259 --> 00:27:55,302
I threw up like five times.

371
00:27:55,302 --> 00:27:57,177
No, I think it's
just a stomach thing.

372
00:27:57,178 --> 00:27:59,263
Um, it's really nice though.

373
00:27:59,264 --> 00:28:00,639
You two should
go, you should go.

374
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:02,684
Wait, what?
No, not without you.

375
00:28:03,518 --> 00:28:04,838
Come on, let's go.

376
00:28:08,815 --> 00:28:12,109
You know what? I just need some
sleep, that's, that's all. Yeah.

377
00:28:12,110 --> 00:28:13,527
Okay, do you want us

378
00:28:13,528 --> 00:28:14,612
to bring you anything?

379
00:28:14,613 --> 00:28:17,406
Like soup,
electrolytes, anything?

380
00:28:17,407 --> 00:28:18,866
Uh, no, that's cool.

381
00:28:18,867 --> 00:28:21,493
Um, yeah, I'm-I'm fine.

382
00:28:21,494 --> 00:28:23,537
I'll call you later
though. I'm sorry.

383
00:28:28,376 --> 00:28:29,336
Uh...

384
00:28:30,045 --> 00:28:32,505
Uh, what the fuck? Okay.

385
00:29:37,279 --> 00:29:38,279
Thank you.

386
00:30:16,526 --> 00:30:17,861
Oh!

387
00:30:18,403 --> 00:30:21,155
I'm sorry, I-I didn't
mean to scare you.

388
00:30:21,156 --> 00:30:22,824
Oh, it's okay.

389
00:30:23,617 --> 00:30:26,703
I'm Florence. D-don't
worry, I don't bite.

390
00:30:31,958 --> 00:30:33,710
This is why you're here, right?

391
00:30:38,798 --> 00:30:40,926
You're not alone,
I promise you that.

392
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:42,761
We can help.

393
00:30:44,763 --> 00:30:45,846
Come, dear.

394
00:30:55,232 --> 00:30:57,484
We have a new guest
with us today.

395
00:30:58,485 --> 00:30:59,736
Oh.

396
00:31:00,362 --> 00:31:01,862
Hello.

397
00:31:01,863 --> 00:31:03,156
This is a rare treat.

398
00:31:07,077 --> 00:31:08,745
Welcome.

399
00:31:13,792 --> 00:31:15,501
I'm Fred.

400
00:31:15,502 --> 00:31:16,670
Have a seat.

401
00:31:19,923 --> 00:31:22,759
Sorry for the location,
I'm sure that was odd.

402
00:31:23,593 --> 00:31:25,595
But we have to stay
pretty removed.

403
00:31:26,263 --> 00:31:29,391
Uh, coffee, croissants,
make yourself at home.

404
00:31:32,852 --> 00:31:34,270
Fantastic.

405
00:31:34,271 --> 00:31:35,480
Uh, quick intro?

406
00:31:37,816 --> 00:31:41,444
Um... I'm Hannah.

407
00:31:42,112 --> 00:31:43,571
Hi, Hannah.

408
00:31:43,572 --> 00:31:44,739
Um,

409
00:31:46,408 --> 00:31:47,951
something happened to me.

410
00:31:52,038 --> 00:31:53,999
Fuck, I don't know what
to say. It sounds insane.

411
00:31:55,083 --> 00:31:57,459
You're here because we
all have the same problem.

412
00:31:57,460 --> 00:31:59,962
We all have an appendage,

413
00:31:59,963 --> 00:32:02,631
a creature whose goal
is to make us miserable

414
00:32:02,632 --> 00:32:04,258
and benefit from it.

415
00:32:04,259 --> 00:32:05,634
Wait. Wait, wait.

416
00:32:05,635 --> 00:32:08,387
You all have that-that
thing growing out of you?

417
00:32:08,388 --> 00:32:10,306
The whatever the fuck that...

418
00:32:10,307 --> 00:32:13,101
Yes. They grow out
of our birthmarks.

419
00:32:13,894 --> 00:32:16,770
We think it's an
undiscovered genetic illness

420
00:32:16,771 --> 00:32:18,523
caused by dual DNA.

421
00:32:20,567 --> 00:32:22,943
Holy shit! Holy shit.

422
00:32:22,944 --> 00:32:25,195
Okay, wow, I literally
thought I was losing my mind.

423
00:32:25,196 --> 00:32:26,697
No, not at all.

424
00:32:26,698 --> 00:32:28,241
Wait, we should
all do something.

425
00:32:28,241 --> 00:32:30,034
We should go to a
hospital or something.

426
00:32:30,035 --> 00:32:31,620
I mean, if we go together,
then they'll all believe it.

427
00:32:31,620 --> 00:32:33,622
No.

428
00:32:34,956 --> 00:32:39,001
One of our members informed his
position and he is now institutionalized

429
00:32:39,002 --> 00:32:41,963
and part of an inhumane
clinical trial.

430
00:32:42,589 --> 00:32:44,090
I'm a practicing
anesthesiologist.

431
00:32:45,300 --> 00:32:47,969
Take my medical knowledge
as an advantage here.

432
00:32:49,262 --> 00:32:50,638
To start...

433
00:32:50,639 --> 00:32:52,439
This
is his favorite part.

434
00:32:55,685 --> 00:32:57,019
An appendage is?

435
00:32:57,020 --> 00:32:58,230
A parasite.

436
00:32:59,105 --> 00:33:02,566
Feeds off you, its
host, to survive

437
00:33:02,567 --> 00:33:05,986
using some form of hypnosis to
make your mind and body vulnerable.

438
00:33:12,202 --> 00:33:14,036
We don’t know what
happens medically,

439
00:33:14,037 --> 00:33:16,038
but it makes you weaker
and them stronger.

440
00:33:16,039 --> 00:33:19,667
Like a hot ball transferring
heat to a cold ball.

441
00:33:19,668 --> 00:33:21,419
How do we get rid of it?

442
00:33:26,258 --> 00:33:28,510
You've obviously noticed by now,

443
00:33:29,636 --> 00:33:32,138
there's an inexplicable
link between you.

444
00:33:33,682 --> 00:33:35,976
Mental, physical.

445
00:33:37,269 --> 00:33:39,771
What do you think would happen
if you killed your appendage?

446
00:33:41,606 --> 00:33:43,275
We've had losses.

447
00:33:46,278 --> 00:33:48,071
Why is this happening to me?

448
00:33:52,367 --> 00:33:56,745
We think appendages grow from
something deep inside us,

449
00:33:56,746 --> 00:33:59,373
something unknowable
and painful.

450
00:33:59,374 --> 00:34:02,960
It's a combination of
unpredictable factors.

451
00:34:02,961 --> 00:34:06,505
This period in your life, this
particular thing happening,

452
00:34:06,506 --> 00:34:08,466
your inability to deal with
it in that moment in time...

453
00:34:14,306 --> 00:34:15,932
Your unique chemistry.

454
00:34:17,142 --> 00:34:20,812
I lost my daughter 15 years
ago in a car accident.

455
00:34:21,563 --> 00:34:23,480
Didn't appear then,

456
00:34:23,481 --> 00:34:26,525
during the most painful
period of my life.

457
00:34:26,526 --> 00:34:31,071
Years later, I spilled a
glass of water at my desk,

458
00:34:31,072 --> 00:34:32,449
and that was it.

459
00:34:34,618 --> 00:34:36,328
I don't know how
else to explain it.

460
00:34:37,829 --> 00:34:39,122
Does that make sense to you?

461
00:34:40,790 --> 00:34:41,749
Hmm.

462
00:34:41,750 --> 00:34:44,085
So, we hide it,

463
00:34:48,715 --> 00:34:50,049
and sedate it.

464
00:34:50,050 --> 00:34:51,759
The appendage? FRED: Yes.

465
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:55,137
The sedatives will have an effect
on you since you are linked.

466
00:34:55,138 --> 00:34:57,765
A bit of brain fog,
but you adjust.

467
00:34:57,766 --> 00:35:01,144
If you keep your appendage
a secret and shut it up,

468
00:35:02,062 --> 00:35:03,980
you can live a
fairly normal life.

469
00:35:05,482 --> 00:35:09,736
It'll cost $150 a week for the
materials, but I offer a plan.

470
00:35:11,446 --> 00:35:12,447
Okay.

471
00:35:16,618 --> 00:35:17,452
Hey.

472
00:35:18,620 --> 00:35:20,287
You okay?

473
00:35:20,288 --> 00:35:23,165
Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine.

474
00:35:23,166 --> 00:35:25,335
Yeah, I almost passed
out my first time, so.

475
00:35:26,086 --> 00:35:27,337
It's quite the news flash.

476
00:35:28,630 --> 00:35:29,839
Yeah.

477
00:35:31,216 --> 00:35:32,217
I'm Claudia.

478
00:35:33,134 --> 00:35:34,177
I'm Hannah.

479
00:35:36,137 --> 00:35:37,930
Do you wanna get
coffee or something?

480
00:35:37,931 --> 00:35:39,558
I live just around the corner.

481
00:35:41,977 --> 00:35:43,561
Uh, yeah.

482
00:35:43,562 --> 00:35:44,895
- Okay.
- Okay.

483
00:35:44,896 --> 00:35:46,606
I mean, it can't
get weirder than this, so...

484
00:35:46,606 --> 00:35:47,606
I know.

485
00:35:59,411 --> 00:36:00,745
Oh, wow, do you have kids?

486
00:36:03,206 --> 00:36:06,709
No, those are my, um,
students' drawings.

487
00:36:06,710 --> 00:36:08,168
I teach second grade.

488
00:36:08,169 --> 00:36:09,503
Oh, wow.

489
00:36:09,504 --> 00:36:12,506
Those kind of
remind me to keep doing it

490
00:36:12,507 --> 00:36:16,177
because I love my students,
but, holy shit, it's hard.

491
00:36:19,306 --> 00:36:21,182
Do you... Oh, do you want cream?

492
00:36:22,893 --> 00:36:25,812
Um, uh, no. Black
is okay, thank you.

493
00:36:27,314 --> 00:36:29,773
So do you live here
with a partner or...

494
00:36:29,774 --> 00:36:31,234
Divorced lone wolf.

495
00:36:32,068 --> 00:36:34,862
We can thank my ex-husband
for the fancy apartment,

496
00:36:34,863 --> 00:36:37,365
perks to being married
to a finance bro.

497
00:36:38,867 --> 00:36:40,576
You and a finance bro, really?

498
00:36:40,577 --> 00:36:42,244
What? Seem weird?

499
00:36:42,245 --> 00:36:44,997
I mean, I just don't really
peg you as the finance bro type.

500
00:36:44,998 --> 00:36:47,499
Hmm, interesting, I'm
not.

501
00:36:47,500 --> 00:36:49,585
I met him in high school

502
00:36:49,586 --> 00:36:52,881
and, you know, he was older,
so I thought he was it.

503
00:36:54,424 --> 00:36:57,718
He's the only person
I had ever been with

504
00:36:57,719 --> 00:37:00,597
until we got
divorced a year ago.

505
00:37:01,640 --> 00:37:03,350
And then I slept
with everybody, so...

506
00:37:04,434 --> 00:37:05,810
Well, I mean, cheers
to your sex life.

507
00:37:05,810 --> 00:37:09,064
Oh, thank you. No one's
ever acknowledged to that.

508
00:37:10,106 --> 00:37:11,941
Hmm. So what about you?

509
00:37:11,942 --> 00:37:13,318
Any loves?

510
00:37:15,487 --> 00:37:17,029
Uh, yeah, yeah.

511
00:37:17,030 --> 00:37:19,782
My, uh, boyfriend, Kaelin.

512
00:37:19,783 --> 00:37:21,116
Ah.

513
00:37:21,117 --> 00:37:23,285
We've been
together for six months now

514
00:37:23,286 --> 00:37:27,082
and it feels really
special, you know.

515
00:37:31,044 --> 00:37:32,879
It sounds like
there's a "but" there.

516
00:37:34,422 --> 00:37:35,382
Um...

517
00:37:36,591 --> 00:37:39,636
My best friend Esther and him...

518
00:37:42,722 --> 00:37:43,764
I just don't know.

519
00:37:43,765 --> 00:37:46,016
I feel like
I've-I've seen signs.

520
00:37:46,017 --> 00:37:48,185
You know, they went
to college together

521
00:37:48,186 --> 00:37:50,145
and they've known
each other longer.

522
00:37:50,146 --> 00:37:51,731
She introduced us, actually.

523
00:37:54,025 --> 00:37:56,820
Oof, I know that feeling.

524
00:37:59,948 --> 00:38:01,948
I really hope they wouldn't
do something like that.

525
00:38:07,747 --> 00:38:09,248
Ugh.

526
00:38:09,249 --> 00:38:11,209
It doesn't like the restraints.

527
00:38:13,295 --> 00:38:14,504
I mean, don't blame it.

528
00:38:15,046 --> 00:38:17,007
Yeah, mine's tied up,
too. It's in my basement.

529
00:38:20,302 --> 00:38:23,596
Oh, you're the first
person from the meetup

530
00:38:23,597 --> 00:38:25,347
that I can actually talk to.

531
00:38:25,348 --> 00:38:26,807
I mean, you saw them.

532
00:38:26,808 --> 00:38:28,684
I don't know, you can't
really have people over

533
00:38:28,685 --> 00:38:31,438
when you have something
in your basement.

534
00:38:32,898 --> 00:38:35,442
This just feels like

535
00:38:36,610 --> 00:38:38,360
less lonely, I guess.

536
00:38:38,361 --> 00:38:39,945
I don't know. It's nice.

537
00:38:39,946 --> 00:38:42,281
Yeah, it is nice.

538
00:38:42,282 --> 00:38:43,241
Hmm.

539
00:38:44,367 --> 00:38:46,285
Ugh.

540
00:38:46,286 --> 00:38:47,536
Shouldn't you sedate it?

541
00:38:47,537 --> 00:38:49,705
I don't know. Sometimes
I feel like...

542
00:38:49,706 --> 00:38:52,082
I... I feel bad.

543
00:38:52,083 --> 00:38:54,376
It feels like it's
inhumane or something.

544
00:38:54,377 --> 00:38:57,046
Yeah, but it's better than
hearing all that vile stuff.

545
00:38:57,047 --> 00:38:59,215
It's like it validates
the negative beliefs

546
00:38:59,216 --> 00:39:00,716
you hold about yourself.

547
00:39:00,717 --> 00:39:02,218
Oh, that's very shrink-like.

548
00:39:02,219 --> 00:39:04,220
Yeah, had one
of those in high school.

549
00:39:04,221 --> 00:39:07,140
I, uh, did some stupid shit.

550
00:39:09,851 --> 00:39:11,144
Yeah?

551
00:39:11,853 --> 00:39:12,937
Same.

552
00:39:12,938 --> 00:39:15,231
- You did?
- Are we the same person?

553
00:39:15,232 --> 00:39:16,482
Okay, sorry.

554
00:39:16,483 --> 00:39:18,859
I'm, uh, procrastinating.

555
00:39:18,860 --> 00:39:21,238
I'm gonna go sedate it.

556
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:09,034
Wait, stop.

557
00:40:09,035 --> 00:40:10,744
I can help you.

558
00:40:12,539 --> 00:40:13,664
You wanna help me?

559
00:40:13,665 --> 00:40:17,251
Yes, I'm here for you.

560
00:40:17,252 --> 00:40:22,506
If you silence me,
you will suffer.

561
00:40:26,011 --> 00:40:29,305
No. Bitch...

562
00:41:00,795 --> 00:41:02,213
Whoa.

563
00:41:02,214 --> 00:41:05,549
It's me, babe. I let myself in.

564
00:41:05,550 --> 00:41:07,010
What are you doing here?

565
00:41:07,510 --> 00:41:09,970
It's Sunday. We had plans?

566
00:41:09,971 --> 00:41:11,097
I just texted you?

567
00:41:13,975 --> 00:41:15,185
Oh, yeah.

568
00:41:15,936 --> 00:41:17,812
Shit, sorry, I spaced.

569
00:41:19,814 --> 00:41:21,107
I'm glad you're here.

570
00:41:31,952 --> 00:41:33,077
Uh...

571
00:41:33,078 --> 00:41:35,038
Why are you looking
at me like that?

572
00:41:38,124 --> 00:41:41,461
Uh, let's talk for
a second. Please?

573
00:41:52,013 --> 00:41:56,559
Listen, I-I know you've
been stressed lately.

574
00:41:56,560 --> 00:42:00,981
Not sleeping, working late,
but I'm worried about you, Han.

575
00:42:04,025 --> 00:42:05,359
I'm dealing with it.

576
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:06,945
Dealing with it? How?

577
00:42:11,199 --> 00:42:13,577
Um, you wouldn't believe me.

578
00:42:15,620 --> 00:42:17,454
Uh, d-did something happen?

579
00:42:17,455 --> 00:42:19,749
I mean, you can
tell me anything.

580
00:42:27,966 --> 00:42:28,925
Okay.

581
00:42:30,385 --> 00:42:32,220
This is gonna sound crazy,

582
00:42:33,930 --> 00:42:36,308
but something grew out of me.

583
00:42:37,142 --> 00:42:38,642
Okay, it's called an appendage.

584
00:42:38,643 --> 00:42:40,269
It's because I have dual DNA

585
00:42:40,270 --> 00:42:41,688
and there are other people
too who have the ex...

586
00:42:41,688 --> 00:42:43,523
Oth-other, other people?
What-what other people?

587
00:42:43,523 --> 00:42:45,441
What-what are you talking about?

588
00:42:45,442 --> 00:42:48,277
Here. I can, I can show
you, we can go downstairs.

589
00:42:48,278 --> 00:42:49,988
Han, Han, Han, please.

590
00:42:52,866 --> 00:42:54,326
Did you do that to your stomach?

591
00:42:56,202 --> 00:42:58,370
I mean, we're just,
we're worried.

592
00:42:58,371 --> 00:43:00,414
We just don't want you...
- We?

593
00:43:00,415 --> 00:43:01,540
Me and Esther,

594
00:43:01,541 --> 00:43:03,834
we've been trying to figure
out how to talk to you

595
00:43:03,835 --> 00:43:05,711
or-or help you and
it's just hard.

596
00:43:05,712 --> 00:43:07,755
You and Esther talk
behind my back?

597
00:43:07,756 --> 00:43:09,257
No, we don't wanna upset you.

598
00:43:10,008 --> 00:43:12,093
We're trying to be
understanding, you know.

599
00:43:14,554 --> 00:43:16,097
You could try listening.

600
00:43:18,225 --> 00:43:19,184
Uh...

601
00:43:21,394 --> 00:43:22,937
I just wanna be alone.

602
00:43:22,938 --> 00:43:24,313
What? Alone?

603
00:43:24,314 --> 00:43:25,856
I wanna
be alone, okay?

604
00:43:25,857 --> 00:43:27,274
Please just go, okay?

605
00:43:53,885 --> 00:43:55,178
Hey, Han.

606
00:44:00,725 --> 00:44:01,643
Um...

607
00:44:03,853 --> 00:44:05,772
Kaelin told me what
happened last night.

608
00:44:06,856 --> 00:44:08,108
Oh, yeah, told you what?

609
00:44:10,694 --> 00:44:12,278
Just that
you were upset

610
00:44:12,279 --> 00:44:15,656
and you got into a fight.

611
00:44:15,657 --> 00:44:20,537
Did someone foolishly inform you
I was doing a goth collection?

612
00:44:23,039 --> 00:44:24,416
Careful now.

613
00:44:26,167 --> 00:44:28,168
Season Picks are
coming up, people.

614
00:44:29,462 --> 00:44:30,797
Ignore him.

615
00:44:32,549 --> 00:44:34,175
Don't touch me!

616
00:44:35,886 --> 00:44:37,888
You have no idea what
I'm going through, okay?

617
00:44:40,056 --> 00:44:41,850
I mean, you don't
get pain. You...

618
00:44:43,310 --> 00:44:45,853
You're just like a happy
person, so go be happy.

619
00:45:03,330 --> 00:45:05,414
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

620
00:45:05,415 --> 00:45:07,042
He likes you.

621
00:45:48,667 --> 00:45:49,626
Mm.

622
00:45:51,711 --> 00:45:53,964
Where'd you learn
to drink like that?

623
00:45:55,090 --> 00:45:56,841
Guess I've been
doing it for a while.

624
00:45:57,509 --> 00:45:59,511
Oh, yeah?

625
00:46:00,428 --> 00:46:01,513
Cool.

626
00:46:04,641 --> 00:46:06,685
Well, I started in high school

627
00:46:07,602 --> 00:46:11,439
and I guess I just
liked the taste.

628
00:46:11,940 --> 00:46:14,359
You know, it sort of
numbed some stuff.

629
00:46:14,943 --> 00:46:16,736
I was pretty mad all the time.

630
00:46:24,244 --> 00:46:25,745
Yeah, and then I
took it a little

631
00:46:27,414 --> 00:46:28,999
too far my senior year.

632
00:46:29,749 --> 00:46:31,333
I, uh,

633
00:46:31,334 --> 00:46:34,421
crashed my car into
a, uh, freeway median.

634
00:46:35,130 --> 00:46:36,214
What?

635
00:46:37,257 --> 00:46:38,300
Yeah.

636
00:46:39,509 --> 00:46:41,553
My parents had to
leave one of their, um,

637
00:46:43,263 --> 00:46:46,307
fancy dinners to
come to the hospital.

638
00:46:46,308 --> 00:46:49,644
The doctors were watching me

639
00:46:50,478 --> 00:46:53,899
like 24/7 'cause...

640
00:46:58,194 --> 00:47:00,822
I don't know, they were
worried that I would, um...

641
00:47:06,661 --> 00:47:09,956
Uh, yeah, yeah, and then we
just never talked about it.

642
00:47:11,666 --> 00:47:13,084
Were they right?

643
00:47:14,127 --> 00:47:16,546
Did you crash your
car on purpose?

644
00:47:28,516 --> 00:47:32,229
You know, I... I
feel like I'm, um,

645
00:47:33,104 --> 00:47:36,149
defective or like there's
something wrong with me.

646
00:47:39,444 --> 00:47:41,238
You're not defective.

647
00:47:41,905 --> 00:47:44,698
If you are, I am.
You're sensitive.

648
00:47:44,699 --> 00:47:49,162
Welcome to the sad girls
club. Water is warm.

649
00:47:49,746 --> 00:47:50,788
Mm.

650
00:47:53,500 --> 00:47:55,100
Mine doesn't sound
like that, Claudia.

651
00:47:57,087 --> 00:47:58,921
I figured something out.

652
00:47:58,922 --> 00:48:00,589
What?

653
00:48:00,590 --> 00:48:02,800
The dual DNAers
can't know, okay?

654
00:48:02,801 --> 00:48:03,969
Okay.

655
00:48:05,595 --> 00:48:07,763
Everything your
appendage tells you,

656
00:48:07,764 --> 00:48:11,476
all those vile
things, they're true.

657
00:48:12,561 --> 00:48:13,644
What are you saying?

658
00:48:13,645 --> 00:48:15,479
No, it's not a
bad thing. It's...

659
00:48:15,480 --> 00:48:17,231
If you let your
appendage speak to you,

660
00:48:17,232 --> 00:48:19,275
if you don't sedate
it right away,

661
00:48:19,276 --> 00:48:21,736
it's like a personal psychic.

662
00:48:22,612 --> 00:48:23,862
I don't get it.

663
00:48:23,863 --> 00:48:26,533
Okay, you know, when
you asked me if I had kids?

664
00:48:27,367 --> 00:48:29,702
Well, it's more like I can't.

665
00:48:29,703 --> 00:48:32,580
I did like three rounds IVF

666
00:48:32,581 --> 00:48:34,583
and took the supplements,
everything, nothing worked.

667
00:48:34,583 --> 00:48:39,044
And then Sam, my ex, we
stopped sleeping together,

668
00:48:39,045 --> 00:48:42,214
we started to fight
about, like, toilet paper.

669
00:48:42,215 --> 00:48:47,428
And then he started going to
California all the time on business,

670
00:48:47,429 --> 00:48:53,267
but like all the time, and,
uh, I had that feeling.

671
00:48:53,268 --> 00:48:55,185
You know, that feeling.
You know that feeling.

672
00:48:55,186 --> 00:48:58,981
Anyways, I went one night
to sedate my appendage

673
00:48:58,982 --> 00:49:02,902
and I was, I don’t know, I
was like crying or something

674
00:49:02,903 --> 00:49:08,116
and I fumbled with the syringe
and my appendage told me

675
00:49:08,742 --> 00:49:13,204
that Sam was going
to be a daddy.

676
00:49:14,122 --> 00:49:17,583
That he had fallen in
love with this other woman

677
00:49:17,584 --> 00:49:21,086
whose uterus wasn't
filled with tumbleweed

678
00:49:21,087 --> 00:49:22,964
and they were pregnant.

679
00:49:24,299 --> 00:49:25,842
And it was true.

680
00:49:28,303 --> 00:49:30,012
That's... horrible.

681
00:49:30,013 --> 00:49:31,138
Yeah.

682
00:49:31,139 --> 00:49:35,517
But honestly, it was the best
thing that ever happened to me.

683
00:49:35,518 --> 00:49:37,728
If I didn't know the truth,
I would've never moved on.

684
00:49:37,729 --> 00:49:43,526
I would've been sad, barren
Claudia with a finance bro.

685
00:49:45,946 --> 00:49:48,073
Okay. Listen, it's
dangerous.

686
00:49:48,073 --> 00:49:50,407
And if you do it,
it gets stronger,

687
00:49:50,408 --> 00:49:53,494
but as long as you don't
let it fully hypnotize you

688
00:49:53,495 --> 00:49:55,455
before you blackout,
then you'll be okay.

689
00:49:56,456 --> 00:49:57,832
It's hard.

690
00:49:58,667 --> 00:50:00,252
It changed my life.

691
00:50:25,235 --> 00:50:27,695
I can't feel my ass.

692
00:50:30,991 --> 00:50:33,617
Ah, that feels nice.

693
00:50:33,618 --> 00:50:34,493
Thanks.

694
00:50:34,494 --> 00:50:37,789
Why do you keep
me here like this?

695
00:50:38,665 --> 00:50:41,918
Like a shameful
secret left to rot?

696
00:50:42,961 --> 00:50:44,379
I wanna listen now.

697
00:50:45,380 --> 00:50:46,631
Good.

698
00:50:47,841 --> 00:50:49,425
Come closer.

699
00:50:53,013 --> 00:50:54,263
Closer.

700
00:51:00,145 --> 00:51:04,481
You've seen the signs,
the secret texting,

701
00:51:04,482 --> 00:51:08,612
the way they talk about
you behind your back.

702
00:51:09,279 --> 00:51:11,780
The way Kaelin smiles at her.

703
00:51:11,781 --> 00:51:15,993
They seem to have a
closeness you can't achieve.

704
00:51:15,994 --> 00:51:20,498
Kaelin isn't cheating on
you with Esther, not yet.

705
00:51:21,374 --> 00:51:24,461
It's worse. They're in love.

706
00:51:25,587 --> 00:51:29,048
Now, this is the hardest part.

707
00:51:29,049 --> 00:51:31,593
I'm sorry you have to hear this.

708
00:51:32,344 --> 00:51:35,304
No one will ever love you.

709
00:51:35,305 --> 00:51:37,681
Not Kaelin, not Esther,

710
00:51:37,682 --> 00:51:42,144
not Cristeàn or Claudia,
not even your parents.

711
00:51:42,145 --> 00:51:46,398
You are unlovable.

712
00:51:51,071 --> 00:51:52,781
Empty.

713
00:51:53,490 --> 00:51:56,408
My lucky day.

714
00:52:35,073 --> 00:52:37,116
Where are
you, you fucking fuck?

715
00:52:41,413 --> 00:52:43,790
Oh, shit. Shit.

716
00:52:45,333 --> 00:52:46,208
Hello?

717
00:52:46,209 --> 00:52:48,627
Oh, great, you answered.

718
00:52:51,256 --> 00:52:52,715
Are you sick?

719
00:52:54,175 --> 00:52:55,634
What? No, allergies I think.

720
00:52:55,635 --> 00:52:58,012
Ugh, this time
of year is crazy.

721
00:52:58,013 --> 00:53:01,640
Listen, I really hate to bother
you, but I need your help.

722
00:53:01,641 --> 00:53:03,559
There was a problem
with the restaurant.

723
00:53:03,560 --> 00:53:05,936
They transferred the order
to the Manhattan location.

724
00:53:05,937 --> 00:53:10,190
So, I need you to pick it up now or
this dinner will be a total bust.

725
00:53:10,191 --> 00:53:11,567
What?

726
00:53:11,568 --> 00:53:13,444
Our goodbye
dinner tonight.

727
00:53:13,445 --> 00:53:14,528
Did you forget?

728
00:53:14,529 --> 00:53:16,572
I need you to pick up the food.

729
00:53:16,573 --> 00:53:17,907
Oh, no, no, no.

730
00:53:17,908 --> 00:53:19,158
You need me to, um...

731
00:53:19,159 --> 00:53:21,536
Are you drunk?

732
00:53:22,412 --> 00:53:24,038
No, I'm fine.

733
00:53:24,039 --> 00:53:26,415
Well, then why are you
creating this drama?

734
00:53:26,416 --> 00:53:28,919
I'm not, I'm sorry. What
did I do? I'm sorry.

735
00:53:29,669 --> 00:53:30,878
No, no, it's okay.

736
00:53:30,879 --> 00:53:33,214
I just don't understand why
you're acting like this.

737
00:53:34,674 --> 00:53:37,259
Okay, I'll pick
up the food right now.

738
00:53:37,260 --> 00:53:38,636
You don't have to worry.

739
00:53:38,637 --> 00:53:40,012
Thank you, sweetheart.

740
00:53:40,013 --> 00:53:41,931
Oh, and we'll cover your ride.

741
00:53:49,606 --> 00:53:52,316
Claudia, my-my
appendage, it's gone.

742
00:53:52,317 --> 00:53:54,068
I, uh, I-I don't know
what it did to me,

743
00:53:54,069 --> 00:53:56,153
but I feel sick and my
guts are like inside out.

744
00:53:56,154 --> 00:53:57,364
Okay, slow down.

745
00:53:57,364 --> 00:54:00,157
I-I tried to inject it,
but the syringe was empty.

746
00:54:00,158 --> 00:54:02,243
Maybe Fred forgot to
fill one? I don't know.

747
00:54:02,244 --> 00:54:03,535
Okay, this is bad.

748
00:54:03,536 --> 00:54:04,787
I'm gonna be right there...

749
00:54:04,788 --> 00:54:06,248
No, I can't. I'm going
to my parents' tonight.

750
00:54:06,248 --> 00:54:08,082
Okay, call me after.

751
00:54:08,083 --> 00:54:10,710
It's gonna be okay. We're
gonna figure this out, okay?

752
00:54:29,062 --> 00:54:31,106
- It's prepaid, you're good to go.
- Thank you.

753
00:54:42,701 --> 00:54:43,826
Hello?

754
00:55:01,469 --> 00:55:03,054
There you are.

755
00:55:03,722 --> 00:55:05,514
Why didn't you say anything?

756
00:55:05,515 --> 00:55:07,309
Sorry, hi. I did.

757
00:55:08,059 --> 00:55:09,393
Okay.

758
00:55:09,394 --> 00:55:11,270
Uh, so much is
packed up already.

759
00:55:11,271 --> 00:55:13,690
Oh, well, we are moving.

760
00:55:14,316 --> 00:55:15,775
- Your room next.
- Mm-hmm.

761
00:55:18,320 --> 00:55:20,279
Everyone's gonna
be here in an hour.

762
00:55:20,280 --> 00:55:21,573
Will you
help me reheat?

763
00:55:21,573 --> 00:55:23,742
Yeah, yeah. I thought the, um,

764
00:55:24,576 --> 00:55:28,330
the rice could go in the big
blue platter thing that you have.

765
00:55:31,625 --> 00:55:32,917
Is Cristeàn Ulman okay?

766
00:55:32,918 --> 00:55:35,044
I know you've been working
really hard, you know.

767
00:55:35,045 --> 00:55:37,213
I hope you're taking
some time for yourself.

768
00:55:43,178 --> 00:55:44,720
Uh...

769
00:55:44,721 --> 00:55:46,889
Uh...

770
00:55:46,890 --> 00:55:48,767
Some of this will be just fine.

771
00:55:50,477 --> 00:55:53,520
Mom, I'm not doing well.

772
00:55:53,521 --> 00:55:55,648
Something is happening,
and I know it sounds crazy,

773
00:55:55,649 --> 00:55:57,859
but you just have to
listen to me, okay?

774
00:56:02,781 --> 00:56:04,199
It's so hard with you.

775
00:56:05,617 --> 00:56:08,787
I don't know how to help you.

776
00:56:10,205 --> 00:56:13,541
Your car crash in high
school scarred me.

777
00:56:14,834 --> 00:56:16,211
It scarred you?

778
00:56:19,631 --> 00:56:23,842
Do you have any idea
what it feels like

779
00:56:23,843 --> 00:56:27,472
to get a call that your
daughter is in the hospital

780
00:56:28,932 --> 00:56:30,850
on suicide watch?

781
00:56:32,561 --> 00:56:38,358
To not know how beautiful and
special and loved you are?

782
00:56:39,192 --> 00:56:40,860
My baby girl.

783
00:56:43,613 --> 00:56:45,698
Did you ever think
about what it feels like

784
00:56:45,699 --> 00:56:48,618
to wanna do something
like that to yourself?

785
00:56:52,455 --> 00:56:53,747
No.

786
00:56:53,748 --> 00:56:56,251
No, because I'm not fucked up.

787
00:57:01,965 --> 00:57:04,759
I'm sorry I'm so fucked up, Mom.

788
00:57:06,887 --> 00:57:08,138
I'm really sorry.

789
00:57:08,972 --> 00:57:10,931
Hannah. What's going on, ladies?

790
00:57:10,932 --> 00:57:12,391
I threw
up in the food,

791
00:57:12,392 --> 00:57:13,851
but I'll pay you
for the damages.

792
00:57:13,852 --> 00:57:15,478
I'm so sorry, Dad.

793
00:57:18,106 --> 00:57:20,524
You'll pay for the damages?
What is this, Judge Judy?

794
00:57:20,525 --> 00:57:22,193
You don't have to
pay for the damages.

795
00:57:23,778 --> 00:57:25,864
You look terrible.

796
00:57:27,699 --> 00:57:30,160
You're burning up,
Han. Go lie down.

797
00:57:32,078 --> 00:57:33,198
My friend's gonna help me.

798
00:57:33,955 --> 00:57:35,749
Hannah!

799
00:57:39,920 --> 00:57:41,087
Talk to me.

800
00:57:41,087 --> 00:57:42,714
Can you meet me at my
apartment? - Yes.

801
00:57:42,714 --> 00:57:44,006
I'll leave a key under the mat.

802
00:57:44,007 --> 00:57:45,007
On my way.

803
00:58:16,748 --> 00:58:17,958
Claudia?

804
00:58:24,756 --> 00:58:26,007
Claudia?

805
00:58:34,766 --> 00:58:38,269
Shh. It's okay.

806
00:58:40,146 --> 00:58:42,566
I know how you feel.

807
00:58:43,858 --> 00:58:48,362
To them you'll always be the
disappointing daughter...

808
00:58:48,363 --> 00:58:52,908
who
crashed her car on purpose.

809
00:58:55,161 --> 00:59:00,958
Maybe... if you'd been
a better daughter,

810
00:59:00,959 --> 00:59:04,420
they'd have noticed
what was happening.

811
00:59:04,421 --> 00:59:05,963
Oh, yes.

812
00:59:05,964 --> 00:59:11,928
Maybe if you had
been a different kid.

813
00:59:12,596 --> 00:59:17,475
Maybe if it wasn't
you that came out.

814
00:59:21,187 --> 00:59:23,231
You should do it again.

815
00:59:24,691 --> 00:59:29,446
Oh. It wasn't so hard last time.

816
00:59:31,531 --> 00:59:35,576
No one would even notice.

817
00:59:35,577 --> 00:59:37,078
Oh, my God.

818
00:59:37,954 --> 00:59:39,914
Mom? Mom?

819
00:59:39,915 --> 00:59:43,667
Shh. It's just me.

820
00:59:43,668 --> 00:59:46,755
She's not here.

821
01:00:48,066 --> 01:00:48,983
Feeling okay?

822
01:00:48,984 --> 01:00:50,776
Yeah, much better.

823
01:00:50,777 --> 01:00:52,861
Try this, it's comfy.

824
01:00:52,862 --> 01:00:55,656
Thanks. Do I just
put, put it over my head?

825
01:00:55,657 --> 01:00:56,949
Yeah, it's cashmere.

826
01:00:56,950 --> 01:00:58,785
Oh, my God.

827
01:01:02,038 --> 01:01:04,958
Yes, yes. HANNAH: Wow.

828
01:01:08,169 --> 01:01:10,213
Wait, how do we blend in though?

829
01:01:10,714 --> 01:01:12,090
Customs.

830
01:01:13,466 --> 01:01:15,093
Hello, blue eyes.

831
01:01:17,888 --> 01:01:20,307
Oh, someone's awake.

832
01:01:21,141 --> 01:01:22,516
Good morning.

833
01:01:22,517 --> 01:01:25,019
You hosts are too sensitive.

834
01:01:25,020 --> 01:01:26,980
Okay, that's why you
can't come out with us.

835
01:01:27,731 --> 01:01:28,940
Mine was like this.

836
01:01:30,817 --> 01:01:32,860
Mine wanted to literally die

837
01:01:32,861 --> 01:01:35,487
when I told her Sam
was gonna be a daddy.

838
01:01:35,488 --> 01:01:37,865
I made that part
up. That was me.

839
01:01:37,866 --> 01:01:39,742
I mean, she couldn't
have kids, that was true,

840
01:01:39,743 --> 01:01:43,829
but I upped the stakes, you
know, added a little drama.

841
01:01:43,830 --> 01:01:46,665
Kinda like I emptied
your syringe.

842
01:01:46,666 --> 01:01:48,542
You're welcome.

843
01:01:48,543 --> 01:01:50,127
You get it now, right?

844
01:01:50,128 --> 01:01:52,379
I'm Claudia's appendage.

845
01:01:52,380 --> 01:01:53,923
Oh, but call me Claudia.

846
01:01:53,924 --> 01:01:55,342
Keep it simple.

847
01:01:56,259 --> 01:01:57,676
Oh, see?

848
01:01:57,677 --> 01:02:00,305
Ugh! You couldn't
handle all this anyways.

849
01:02:01,264 --> 01:02:02,098
Your life and all.

850
01:02:02,766 --> 01:02:03,807
Wah.

851
01:02:03,808 --> 01:02:05,968
I can't
wait to replace this bitch.

852
01:02:06,311 --> 01:02:08,646
I'm gonna make a splash
at Cristeàn Ulman

853
01:02:08,647 --> 01:02:12,483
and not to mention getting
back in Kaelin's pants.

854
01:02:15,403 --> 01:02:16,843
So proud of you.

855
01:02:27,249 --> 01:02:28,792
Just have to do this once.

856
01:02:29,584 --> 01:02:31,835
- You go.
- No, no, no, you go. You go.

857
01:02:31,836 --> 01:02:33,420
Oh, my God.

858
01:02:33,421 --> 01:02:35,423
She's leaking everywhere.

859
01:02:37,801 --> 01:02:42,054
For now, you have to feed it
every night to keep it alive.

860
01:02:42,055 --> 01:02:46,851
You're still linked, it's
a drag, but not for long.

861
01:02:47,644 --> 01:02:52,274
We're gonna help find you
someone else and you'll be free.

862
01:02:57,070 --> 01:03:00,740
Thanks for the phone,
pathetic bitch.

863
01:03:05,203 --> 01:03:06,037
Bye!

864
01:03:15,755 --> 01:03:16,590
Hmm.

865
01:03:27,350 --> 01:03:28,590
Oh, my
God, it's Hannah.

866
01:03:30,312 --> 01:03:31,604
Are you serious?

867
01:03:31,605 --> 01:03:33,689
Hold on, what...
what is she saying?

868
01:03:33,690 --> 01:03:35,317
She's apologizing.

869
01:03:36,318 --> 01:03:38,320
"The
way I acted was out of line.

870
01:03:38,320 --> 01:03:41,530
"It wasn't personal, it's all
me and I'm working through it.

871
01:03:41,531 --> 01:03:45,326
"Hope you can forgive me but
understand if you need time to process.

872
01:03:45,327 --> 01:03:48,245
See you at work
tomorrow. Heart emoji."

873
01:03:48,246 --> 01:03:49,831
- Oh, that's good. I'd buy that. Yeah.
- Isn't that good?

874
01:03:49,831 --> 01:03:53,376
Wow. She's texting me this?

875
01:03:54,419 --> 01:03:57,589
I mean, it's good. You know,
maybe she's come out of it.

876
01:03:58,215 --> 01:03:59,798
Whatever it was.

877
01:04:04,971 --> 01:04:06,680
Oh, my God, this
stuff is so nasty.

878
01:04:06,681 --> 01:04:08,098
I know.

879
01:04:08,099 --> 01:04:10,100
It's totally disgusting,
but you gotta assimilate.

880
01:04:15,273 --> 01:04:16,233
Oh, shit.

881
01:04:17,025 --> 01:04:17,859
What?

882
01:04:18,485 --> 01:04:19,527
It's her.

883
01:04:20,904 --> 01:04:22,696
Put an eggplant emoji.

884
01:04:22,697 --> 01:04:23,697
Eggplant.

885
01:04:23,698 --> 01:04:25,199
And then the water
squirting emoji.

886
01:04:25,200 --> 01:04:26,158
Water squirting emoji

887
01:04:26,159 --> 01:04:27,660
on the princess' face.
- Water squirt.

888
01:04:27,661 --> 01:04:28,828
Oh, my God.
- Right there.

889
01:04:30,413 --> 01:04:32,414
Send.
- Are you sure?

890
01:04:32,415 --> 01:04:33,540
Positive.

891
01:04:33,541 --> 01:04:36,544
Oh. Oh, wow.

892
01:04:36,545 --> 01:04:37,962
What?

893
01:04:37,963 --> 01:04:39,880
Uh, nothing.

894
01:04:39,881 --> 01:04:41,340
What the fuck are you doing?

895
01:04:41,341 --> 01:04:43,551
It's private shit,
okay? Don't be looking.

896
01:04:43,552 --> 01:04:44,427
Gross.

897
01:04:46,221 --> 01:04:47,721
You don't find this
a little weird,

898
01:04:47,722 --> 01:04:50,516
just like her texting
everyone out of the blue?

899
01:04:50,517 --> 01:04:53,520
I'm her best friend, she should
apologize to me in person.

900
01:04:53,937 --> 01:04:55,938
I mean, I-I-I don't know, E.

901
01:04:55,939 --> 01:04:57,606
I've been doing a
lot of reading online

902
01:04:57,607 --> 01:05:00,776
and it says that sometimes
it happens like this.

903
01:05:00,777 --> 01:05:03,571
The person retreats,
then comes back.

904
01:05:03,572 --> 01:05:06,824
We have to be understanding,
but it doesn't make it okay.

905
01:05:06,825 --> 01:05:08,617
I agree. I agree about that.

906
01:05:08,618 --> 01:05:10,661
Okay, well, the fuckin'
Internet's bullshit, okay?

907
01:05:10,662 --> 01:05:11,705
I know Hannah.

908
01:05:12,831 --> 01:05:15,667
She better fuckin' talk to me in
person if she wants to stay friends.

909
01:05:16,334 --> 01:05:17,293
E.

910
01:05:17,294 --> 01:05:18,211
E?

911
01:05:24,259 --> 01:05:25,594
Ding-dong.

912
01:05:26,052 --> 01:05:27,595
I brought dinner.

913
01:05:27,596 --> 01:05:29,973
Mm, so delicious.

914
01:05:30,599 --> 01:05:31,474
Mm!

915
01:05:36,771 --> 01:05:37,851
Open up.

916
01:05:38,815 --> 01:05:39,858
You need to force it.

917
01:06:02,422 --> 01:06:04,591
Okay...

918
01:06:06,551 --> 01:06:07,594
Ew.

919
01:06:16,394 --> 01:06:17,311
Han?

920
01:06:26,071 --> 01:06:27,271
Esther, hi.

921
01:06:28,114 --> 01:06:29,157
I wasn't expecting you.

922
01:06:31,660 --> 01:06:32,535
Hey.

923
01:06:33,787 --> 01:06:37,206
Hey. Um... your text.

924
01:06:37,207 --> 01:06:40,544
I... I-I wanted
to talk in person.

925
01:06:41,378 --> 01:06:43,337
Uh, I'm sorry, is
everything okay in there?

926
01:06:43,338 --> 01:06:44,673
I thought I heard
somebody yelling.

927
01:06:44,673 --> 01:06:47,091
Oh, yeah, I just
stubbed my stupid toe.

928
01:06:47,092 --> 01:06:48,510
Your toe is so stupid.

929
01:06:49,386 --> 01:06:50,470
I'm Claudia, by the way.

930
01:06:51,763 --> 01:06:52,722
Esther.

931
01:06:53,557 --> 01:06:55,392
Uh, I
would love to talk in person.

932
01:06:55,392 --> 01:06:57,893
Uh, I'm seeing Kaelin on Sunday,

933
01:06:57,894 --> 01:07:01,230
but maybe the day after we can
go get some dinner or something.

934
01:07:01,231 --> 01:07:03,858
Yeah, I would, I would
really love that.

935
01:07:06,778 --> 01:07:09,697
Um... okay.

936
01:07:09,698 --> 01:07:11,199
So great to meet you.

937
01:07:11,199 --> 01:07:13,952
Heard so much about you. Bye.

938
01:07:15,287 --> 01:07:17,038
Have a good night.

939
01:07:32,220 --> 01:07:33,178
K?

940
01:07:33,179 --> 01:07:34,722
Please tell me you
didn't scare her.

941
01:07:34,723 --> 01:07:35,557
Something's wrong.

942
01:07:35,557 --> 01:07:37,892
I-I showed up and she was
in the fucking basement

943
01:07:37,893 --> 01:07:39,768
and then there was this
random-ass woman there,

944
01:07:39,769 --> 01:07:43,647
and I heard crying, like
straight-up fucking crying.

945
01:07:43,648 --> 01:07:44,899
And she said stubbed her toe,

946
01:07:44,900 --> 01:07:47,234
but that's like absolute
fucking bullshit.

947
01:07:47,235 --> 01:07:49,528
Wait, what? W-w-w-what
do you mean?

948
01:07:49,529 --> 01:07:51,864
What if she's hiding
something down there?

949
01:07:51,865 --> 01:07:53,116
What? Like, what,
you think she has a,

950
01:07:53,116 --> 01:07:55,159
a monster in-in the basement

951
01:07:55,160 --> 01:07:58,078
or maybe she's into human trafficking
now, E? Like, what-what's up?

952
01:07:58,079 --> 01:08:00,206
K, what about believing
what she said?

953
01:08:00,957 --> 01:08:04,502
Someone we both love just went
through a mental health crisis.

954
01:08:05,003 --> 01:08:07,797
Let's not jump to
conclusions. Let's be patient.

955
01:08:09,132 --> 01:08:12,260
Maybe the best thing to do
is just... take a breath.

956
01:08:36,743 --> 01:08:37,786
Hmm.

957
01:08:41,414 --> 01:08:43,124
I see you did the whole

958
01:08:44,042 --> 01:08:46,294
goth thing and then some.

959
01:08:48,880 --> 01:08:49,714
Why?

960
01:08:50,215 --> 01:08:51,591
This will add variety.

961
01:08:52,884 --> 01:08:53,969
Help you stand out.

962
01:08:56,555 --> 01:08:57,596
Excuse me?

963
01:08:57,597 --> 01:09:01,642
When you were my age, you
designed the Ophelia Lilly

964
01:09:01,643 --> 01:09:04,270
2012 fall collection
breakout dress

965
01:09:04,271 --> 01:09:06,022
that wowed everybody.

966
01:09:06,773 --> 01:09:09,150
It was eccentric and sexy.

967
01:09:11,653 --> 01:09:14,197
I want this to be that for you.

968
01:09:17,993 --> 01:09:22,496
I, um... I haven't thought
about that design in ages.

969
01:09:25,250 --> 01:09:30,796
Uh, to believe irrationally
in your own ability,

970
01:09:30,797 --> 01:09:36,385
in your own vision, to
ignore opposing opinions,

971
01:09:36,386 --> 01:09:39,388
to push through self-doubt

972
01:09:39,389 --> 01:09:42,475
and... to trust yourself

973
01:09:43,351 --> 01:09:45,186
because no one out there will.

974
01:09:46,563 --> 01:09:48,732
That is the heart of success.

975
01:09:56,364 --> 01:10:00,242
Welcome to my Season Picks.

976
01:10:27,604 --> 01:10:29,939
the darkness is
enveloping the light.

977
01:10:54,256 --> 01:10:56,549
I've been working
on this process

978
01:10:56,550 --> 01:10:58,509
for about nine weeks and
I'm really excited...

979
01:10:58,510 --> 01:11:00,804
Everyone, meet Hannah.

980
01:11:01,596 --> 01:11:02,681
The better version.

981
01:11:03,598 --> 01:11:04,807
Hello, Hannah.

982
01:11:16,486 --> 01:11:20,573
Your host's name, their
life, their memories,

983
01:11:20,574 --> 01:11:22,033
they're yours now.

984
01:11:23,159 --> 01:11:24,369
Like ours.

985
01:11:25,745 --> 01:11:27,497
You are Hannah.

986
01:12:06,953 --> 01:12:09,122
This is Emmett.

987
01:12:10,081 --> 01:12:12,042
I've been studying
Emmett for weeks.

988
01:12:12,918 --> 01:12:14,793
Today, I'll show you
a new way of feeding

989
01:12:14,794 --> 01:12:18,256
I've developed off
regular people, like him.

990
01:12:19,716 --> 01:12:22,260
This will change
everything for us.

991
01:12:23,303 --> 01:12:24,721
Okay. Alright.

992
01:12:27,891 --> 01:12:30,291
It's the same
process we used on our hosts.

993
01:12:31,102 --> 01:12:35,023
We study the subject deeply,
understand their weaknesses.

994
01:12:35,607 --> 01:12:38,984
And grind them down
mentally until they submit.

995
01:12:38,985 --> 01:12:41,529
The best part,
when you feed once,

996
01:12:42,280 --> 01:12:45,325
it severs your link
with your host forever.

997
01:12:45,867 --> 01:12:47,285
My host is dead.

998
01:12:49,079 --> 01:12:51,665
You'll feed on civilians now.

999
01:12:52,207 --> 01:12:54,375
They don't deserve to live.

1000
01:12:54,376 --> 01:12:57,963
They're disgusting,
weak, filled with errors.

1001
01:12:59,005 --> 01:13:01,383
You won't need
your hosts anymore.

1002
01:13:02,884 --> 01:13:04,803
Hannah?

1003
01:13:06,638 --> 01:13:08,597
Hannah!

1004
01:13:10,934 --> 01:13:15,939
I was saving this one for
you all as a demo to learn.

1005
01:13:17,274 --> 01:13:19,400
Your
brother is gone

1006
01:13:19,401 --> 01:13:24,530
and he is never,
ever coming back.

1007
01:13:33,206 --> 01:13:35,207
Hannah! Hannah!

1008
01:13:52,017 --> 01:13:55,311
Consider
this a homework assignment.

1009
01:13:55,312 --> 01:13:56,688
Happy hunting.

1010
01:14:05,530 --> 01:14:06,823
Hannah?

1011
01:14:07,991 --> 01:14:09,576
Han? Han?

1012
01:14:10,577 --> 01:14:12,912
Oh, my God. Hannah, it's Esther.

1013
01:14:12,913 --> 01:14:15,290
Hey? Hey? Hey?

1014
01:14:15,957 --> 01:14:19,168
Hannah. I'm gonna
call the police, okay?

1015
01:14:19,169 --> 01:14:21,212
- No.
- We gotta call the police.

1016
01:14:21,213 --> 01:14:22,087
No.

1017
01:14:25,550 --> 01:14:27,843
Hannah? Hannah?

1018
01:14:47,155 --> 01:14:48,240
Han?

1019
01:14:50,200 --> 01:14:51,034
Hey.

1020
01:14:52,744 --> 01:14:54,246
Hey.

1021
01:15:03,547 --> 01:15:05,339
I'm so sorry, Esther.

1022
01:15:05,340 --> 01:15:06,633
It's okay.

1023
01:15:08,510 --> 01:15:10,636
Look, she-she made
me not trust you

1024
01:15:10,637 --> 01:15:13,056
and she said that you
and Kaelin were in love.

1025
01:15:13,890 --> 01:15:15,516
What?

1026
01:15:15,517 --> 01:15:18,936
Because I ruin everything,
because I'm fucked up.

1027
01:15:18,937 --> 01:15:20,355
I don't know.

1028
01:15:21,648 --> 01:15:23,482
I'm so sorry.

1029
01:15:23,483 --> 01:15:24,858
What?

1030
01:15:24,859 --> 01:15:29,072
No. No, no fucking way.
That would never happen.

1031
01:15:34,869 --> 01:15:37,497
You are my number
one bitch, bitch.

1032
01:15:42,002 --> 01:15:43,836
I climbed into a
basement for you.

1033
01:15:43,837 --> 01:15:45,338
You did.

1034
01:15:46,339 --> 01:15:47,883
You fucking did.

1035
01:16:00,020 --> 01:16:01,478
You have a twin?

1036
01:16:01,479 --> 01:16:02,772
No, no.

1037
01:16:03,773 --> 01:16:05,357
It's complicated.

1038
01:16:14,367 --> 01:16:15,452
Hey.

1039
01:16:17,662 --> 01:16:18,829
Hi.

1040
01:16:18,830 --> 01:16:20,581
Whoa.

1041
01:16:20,582 --> 01:16:22,834
Uh, come in.

1042
01:16:38,225 --> 01:16:39,559
You look different.

1043
01:16:40,101 --> 01:16:41,728
Oh, in a good way?

1044
01:16:43,146 --> 01:16:45,065
Just different.

1045
01:16:46,399 --> 01:16:48,443
I'm so sorry for
how I acted, Kaelin.

1046
01:16:49,194 --> 01:16:52,405
I wasn't myself. I was
going through something.

1047
01:16:53,323 --> 01:16:55,533
Yeah. I know.

1048
01:16:58,161 --> 01:16:59,536
I missed you.

1049
01:17:24,980 --> 01:17:27,690
It had like fingers and shit?
What in the actual ass fuck?

1050
01:17:27,691 --> 01:17:29,024
Hannah.

1051
01:17:29,025 --> 01:17:30,902
Hi. How are you feeling?

1052
01:17:31,861 --> 01:17:33,571
Good.

1053
01:17:33,572 --> 01:17:35,114
It presents severely,

1054
01:17:35,115 --> 01:17:37,449
but oddly it doesn't
appear to be contagious.

1055
01:17:37,450 --> 01:17:39,285
Blood counts are fairly normal.

1056
01:17:39,286 --> 01:17:40,202
It?

1057
01:17:40,203 --> 01:17:43,915
Um, we've taken a sample
of the dark discharge.

1058
01:17:44,416 --> 01:17:47,543
Um, we're running a
few genetic tests.

1059
01:17:47,544 --> 01:17:49,253
Is she gonna be okay, though?

1060
01:17:49,254 --> 01:17:51,505
I'd-I'd recommend
another night here.

1061
01:17:51,506 --> 01:17:53,757
For now, don't exert yourself.

1062
01:17:53,758 --> 01:17:55,342
Okay, thank you.

1063
01:17:55,343 --> 01:17:58,929
And, Hannah, we should
discuss further.

1064
01:17:58,930 --> 01:18:03,183
Once you're feeling better, I'd
like to ask a few questions.

1065
01:18:03,184 --> 01:18:04,226
Thank you.

1066
01:18:10,400 --> 01:18:11,775
Sleepover?

1067
01:18:19,784 --> 01:18:21,201
Fuck.

1068
01:18:21,202 --> 01:18:22,578
What?

1069
01:18:22,579 --> 01:18:24,039
That was nice.

1070
01:18:25,540 --> 01:18:28,126
Your, um, your birthmark is,

1071
01:18:28,835 --> 01:18:31,671
is different, like, uh, faded.

1072
01:18:32,214 --> 01:18:33,797
Looks different.

1073
01:18:33,798 --> 01:18:36,968
Oh, yeah, a little cream
from the derm did the trick.

1074
01:18:39,387 --> 01:18:41,305
Huh.

1075
01:18:41,306 --> 01:18:43,641
You think maybe we
can talk in a bit?

1076
01:18:43,642 --> 01:18:45,226
I'm gonna go take
a-a quick shower.

1077
01:18:45,227 --> 01:18:46,937
- Yeah, of course.
- Okay.

1078
01:18:47,771 --> 01:18:49,231
Maybe I'll join you.

1079
01:18:51,066 --> 01:18:54,568
Um, okay. Uh, sure.

1080
01:19:22,222 --> 01:19:25,641
Claudia? Something's wrong.

1081
01:19:39,072 --> 01:19:40,698
Okay, don't freak out,

1082
01:19:40,699 --> 01:19:44,077
but... your host is gone.

1083
01:19:44,661 --> 01:19:46,453
And what the fuck
does that mean?

1084
01:19:46,454 --> 01:19:49,123
Your host
is getting better somehow,

1085
01:19:49,124 --> 01:19:51,584
your energy is draining
because she's gaining

1086
01:19:51,585 --> 01:19:53,961
and we can't find her.

1087
01:19:53,962 --> 01:19:57,214
So, that's, that's the recap.

1088
01:19:57,215 --> 01:19:59,759
What, so I'm gonna be
ugly and shriveled again?

1089
01:20:00,510 --> 01:20:03,596
Okay,
listen, sexy times are over.

1090
01:20:03,597 --> 01:20:05,180
You need to feed now.

1091
01:20:05,181 --> 01:20:09,311
Did Kaelin ever speak to your
host about anything sensitive?

1092
01:20:10,896 --> 01:20:12,939
His mom died of cancer
when he was a kid.

1093
01:20:13,982 --> 01:20:15,024
Perfect.

1094
01:20:29,789 --> 01:20:31,624
Ready to talk.

1095
01:20:31,625 --> 01:20:33,375
Kaelin, pick up.

1096
01:20:33,376 --> 01:20:35,670
What the fuck?
- -It keeps going to voice mail.

1097
01:20:38,048 --> 01:20:38,882
Han?

1098
01:20:40,800 --> 01:20:42,219
Something's wrong.

1099
01:20:44,054 --> 01:20:44,971
What the fuck?

1100
01:20:45,931 --> 01:20:47,057
Kaelin.

1101
01:20:49,226 --> 01:20:51,144
He's not picking up.

1102
01:20:51,645 --> 01:20:52,854
When they left me
in the basement,

1103
01:20:52,854 --> 01:20:55,356
Claudia told the appendage that
we wouldn't be linked for long,

1104
01:20:55,357 --> 01:20:57,358
that they'd find somebody else.

1105
01:20:57,359 --> 01:20:58,610
No, no, no, no, no.
No, no, no, no, no!

1106
01:20:58,610 --> 01:21:00,278
Keep that, keep that
shit in. Not happening.

1107
01:21:00,278 --> 01:21:02,113
Look, they're gonna
hurt him and me.

1108
01:21:03,448 --> 01:21:05,115
Are you sure?

1109
01:21:05,116 --> 01:21:06,952
I just feel it.

1110
01:21:09,663 --> 01:21:11,122
Let's fucking do this.

1111
01:21:30,016 --> 01:21:31,977
Oh, fuck.

1112
01:21:40,068 --> 01:21:42,821
Okay. Come on, let’s go.

1113
01:21:43,989 --> 01:21:45,907
Han, you
okay? - Yeah.

1114
01:21:49,703 --> 01:21:51,871
Fuck, I don't have the keys.

1115
01:21:55,875 --> 01:21:57,168
No, bitch.

1116
01:22:00,171 --> 01:22:01,463
Alright, alright.

1117
01:22:01,464 --> 01:22:02,965
Okay, okay, we're
good, we're good.

1118
01:22:02,966 --> 01:22:04,175
- Okay.
- M-m-move it.

1119
01:22:06,386 --> 01:22:07,679
I'll let you in
through the front door.

1120
01:22:07,679 --> 01:22:10,264
Wait, what? No, no, no, no, no.

1121
01:22:10,265 --> 01:22:12,475
That's not happening.
- Just let me do this, okay?

1122
01:22:18,523 --> 01:22:21,109
Hannah, you look so hot.

1123
01:22:42,130 --> 01:22:43,422
Help!

1124
01:22:43,423 --> 01:22:45,257
Han? Fuck!

1125
01:22:51,723 --> 01:22:53,766
Why are you hitting yourself?

1126
01:22:53,767 --> 01:22:55,392
Stop hitting yourself.

1127
01:22:58,230 --> 01:22:59,856
Fuck!

1128
01:23:00,482 --> 01:23:02,191
Ohh. Okay. Alright.

1129
01:23:03,652 --> 01:23:05,570
Kaelin's almost dead!

1130
01:23:06,154 --> 01:23:10,616
And then Hannah's free from
you, you disgusting shit.

1131
01:23:11,618 --> 01:23:12,869
Come on.

1132
01:23:13,453 --> 01:23:14,495
Help!

1133
01:23:14,496 --> 01:23:17,331
Come on. Oh, fuck.

1134
01:23:17,332 --> 01:23:18,625
I trusted you.

1135
01:23:19,209 --> 01:23:21,961
Boo-fuckin'-hoo.

1136
01:23:23,046 --> 01:23:25,130
You can't!

1137
01:23:25,131 --> 01:23:26,716
We can. Boo.

1138
01:23:32,681 --> 01:23:35,058
Don't move. You
don't wanna get a needle in the eye.

1139
01:23:37,811 --> 01:23:39,395
Oh, hey.

1140
01:23:40,855 --> 01:23:41,855
Oh, fuck.

1141
01:23:50,782 --> 01:23:52,659
Fuck!
- Cold bitch.

1142
01:23:57,163 --> 01:23:57,997
Come on, Han.

1143
01:24:33,283 --> 01:24:35,409
It's over.
Are you okay?

1144
01:24:39,497 --> 01:24:41,332
Oh, my God. Oh.

1145
01:24:47,672 --> 01:24:48,992
You weak shit.

1146
01:24:49,966 --> 01:24:52,844
I'm only here because of
you. I fucking hate you.

1147
01:24:53,678 --> 01:24:54,803
You're a piece of shit

1148
01:24:54,804 --> 01:24:57,807
and I hope fucking you
die, you ugly bitch.

1149
01:25:00,477 --> 01:25:02,853
Yeah, the feeling's mutual,
but that's not gonna happen

1150
01:25:02,854 --> 01:25:04,813
so it's time we get
used to each other.

1151
01:25:08,026 --> 01:25:09,486
I know what you're gonna say

1152
01:25:10,987 --> 01:25:12,572
but I can't trust you.

1153
01:25:14,157 --> 01:25:16,117
And I'm just so tired.

1154
01:25:19,704 --> 01:25:21,831
I'm gonna take
care of you, okay?

1155
01:25:25,544 --> 01:25:27,254
Shh.

1156
01:26:06,543 --> 01:26:08,420
That thing could
never be you, Han.

1157
01:26:51,713 --> 01:26:55,383
Quitting like this is very
erratic, Hannah banana.

1158
01:26:59,179 --> 01:27:01,430
Have you, uh, have-have
you tried therapy?

1159
01:27:01,431 --> 01:27:03,642
There's no shame in it. Plenty
of us are doing it these days.

1160
01:27:03,642 --> 01:27:05,643
Perhaps they can help
you with your, uh,

1161
01:27:05,644 --> 01:27:09,188
your-your-your mood shifts
throughout the future, Hannah.

1162
01:27:09,189 --> 01:27:10,522
I am in therapy.

1163
01:27:12,817 --> 01:27:14,777
Fuck!

1164
01:27:14,778 --> 01:27:15,987
Man.

1165
01:27:16,988 --> 01:27:19,573
Well, this
is the last of it.

1166
01:27:20,784 --> 01:27:22,701
Oh, we forgot to pack
the wine glasses.

1167
01:27:22,702 --> 01:27:24,371
Oh, yeah, of course.

1168
01:27:25,288 --> 01:27:27,608
Hang on, I think I saw
some packing paper over here.

1169
01:27:28,083 --> 01:27:30,292
Or should we use bubble
wrap? Is this gonna be okay?

1170
01:27:30,293 --> 01:27:31,585
Yeah, okay.

1171
01:27:35,632 --> 01:27:38,718
You know what? I'm
sorry, I can't do this.

1172
01:27:46,184 --> 01:27:48,895
I feel completely
invisible here.

1173
01:27:52,857 --> 01:27:56,570
I mean, I was really
sad here, Mom.

1174
01:27:57,612 --> 01:28:02,074
I was really sad here and
I still get sad sometimes

1175
01:28:02,075 --> 01:28:03,826
and that has to be okay.

1176
01:28:03,827 --> 01:28:05,745
That has to be okay with you.

1177
01:28:15,463 --> 01:28:16,922
Okay.

1178
01:28:23,972 --> 01:28:25,265
Okay.

1179
01:28:29,769 --> 01:28:32,606
Yeah. We can definitely
put that order in for you.

1180
01:28:34,065 --> 01:28:36,817
Yeah. Oh, you wanna come
in for measurements?

1181
01:28:36,818 --> 01:28:38,694
Okay, yeah, we love that.

1182
01:28:38,695 --> 01:28:41,531
Um, how is 2:00 p.m. tomorrow?

1183
01:28:42,616 --> 01:28:44,825
Okay, fantastic.

1184
01:28:44,826 --> 01:28:46,994
Uh, did you decide on a plunge
neck, or-or a boat neck?

1185
01:28:55,378 --> 01:28:57,005
You fuck-up.

1186
01:29:05,597 --> 01:29:06,556
Right.

1187
01:29:11,394 --> 01:29:12,478
Do you...

1188
01:29:40,549 --> 01:29:41,967
It's okay.

1189
01:29:42,842 --> 01:29:43,843
Shh.
