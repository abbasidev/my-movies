1
00:01:04,597 --> 00:01:06,395
Hello?

2
00:01:08,328 --> 00:01:10,293
Hope. Hope Adler.

3
00:01:10,428 --> 00:01:12,236
Who is this?

4
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:17,703
Alpine Lake.

5
00:01:17,838 --> 00:01:21,080
It-it's a youth camp
in the mountains.

6
00:01:26,751 --> 00:01:28,516
I, um...

7
00:01:30,516 --> 00:01:32,619
I had these dreams.

8
00:01:33,551 --> 00:01:35,786
Seven numbers.

9
00:01:35,921 --> 00:01:38,559
No area code,
so this call is local.

10
00:01:39,494 --> 00:01:41,760
You're here in Colorado, right?

11
00:01:45,906 --> 00:01:48,602
The numbers were carved in ice.

12
00:01:50,269 --> 00:01:51,638
Yes.

13
00:01:52,546 --> 00:01:53,904
Yes!

14
00:01:56,573 --> 00:01:58,781
Who is this?

15
00:01:58,916 --> 00:02:00,779
Who are you?

16
00:02:03,047 --> 00:02:05,316
Hello?

17
00:02:05,452 --> 00:02:07,918
Hello? Can you hear me?

18
00:02:09,255 --> 00:02:10,524
Hello?

19
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:41,911
<i>Fight! Fight!</i>

20
00:03:42,047 --> 00:03:43,920
Fight! Fight!
Fight! Fight! Fight!

21
00:03:44,056 --> 00:03:45,350
Fight! Fight! Fight!

22
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:55,564
Got to get up, man.

23
00:03:57,003 --> 00:03:58,361
Finn!

24
00:03:58,496 --> 00:03:59,599
Finn!

25
00:03:59,735 --> 00:04:01,000
You're hurting him!

26
00:04:01,136 --> 00:04:02,770
Finney!

27
00:04:02,906 --> 00:04:04,866
Please, stop. Please.

28
00:04:04,977 --> 00:04:06,674
You done yet?

29
00:04:08,041 --> 00:04:09,626
Yes.

30
00:04:09,709 --> 00:04:10,909
Stay the fuck away from me.

31
00:04:18,517 --> 00:04:20,255
Anyone else?

32
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:32,029
Hey.

33
00:04:33,468 --> 00:04:35,298
What the hell was that?

34
00:04:35,434 --> 00:04:36,768
New kid.

35
00:04:36,904 --> 00:04:38,290
Are you just beating up
new kids now?

36
00:04:38,373 --> 00:04:39,471
He started it.

37
00:04:39,606 --> 00:04:41,570
What was it this time?

38
00:04:41,706 --> 00:04:43,372
Uh, the usual.

39
00:04:43,508 --> 00:04:45,984
"Heard you were the badass
that wasted a serial killer.

40
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:47,282
You don't look so tough."

41
00:04:47,418 --> 00:04:48,645
He didn't really say that.

42
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:51,552
Yeah, he actually did.

43
00:04:51,687 --> 00:04:53,848
Did you have to go
so hard on him?

44
00:04:53,984 --> 00:04:56,460
In a situation like that,

45
00:04:56,595 --> 00:04:59,754
the more blood, the better...
for the crowd.

46
00:04:59,890 --> 00:05:01,299
Proves a stronger point.

47
00:05:01,435 --> 00:05:02,961
You've made that point
more than once,

48
00:05:03,096 --> 00:05:05,534
so maybe...
and I'm just spitballing here...

49
00:05:05,670 --> 00:05:07,662
maybe the point
you're actually making

50
00:05:07,798 --> 00:05:10,158
is less "don't fuck with me"
and more "I'm the guy to beat."

51
00:05:11,372 --> 00:05:13,042
Hey, Gwen, Finn.

52
00:05:13,177 --> 00:05:14,570
Great fight, man.

53
00:05:14,705 --> 00:05:16,006
Thanks, Ernesto.

54
00:05:16,142 --> 00:05:17,745
-Hi, Ernie.
-So, uh, tonight,

55
00:05:17,881 --> 00:05:19,567
uh, I'm going to go down
to the Civic Center

56
00:05:19,650 --> 00:05:21,617
to wait in line
for Duran Duran tickets.

57
00:05:21,752 --> 00:05:23,955
-Duran Duran tickets?
-He just said that.

58
00:05:24,091 --> 00:05:26,155
Simon Le Bon is so choice.

59
00:05:26,290 --> 00:05:28,853
A-Are you going, Gwen?

60
00:05:28,988 --> 00:05:31,296
I wish.
Those tickets cost a mint.

61
00:05:31,432 --> 00:05:33,459
My treat.
I was gonna buy two anyway.

62
00:05:33,595 --> 00:05:35,393
It'd, you know, be cool

63
00:05:35,528 --> 00:05:37,608
to have someone to go with
who's... who's also a fan.

64
00:05:38,435 --> 00:05:39,795
-For real?
-For real.

65
00:05:39,931 --> 00:05:40,971
That'd be radical.

66
00:05:41,106 --> 00:05:42,506
Consider it done.

67
00:05:44,039 --> 00:05:46,105
All right, well,
I-I got to get to shop class.

68
00:05:46,241 --> 00:05:47,174
See ya.

69
00:05:50,579 --> 00:05:52,217
You know that's a date.

70
00:05:52,353 --> 00:05:55,153
-No, it's not.
-Yeah, it is.

71
00:05:55,288 --> 00:05:57,554
Okay, so what if it's a date?

72
00:05:59,187 --> 00:06:02,355
I don't know, I...
I just don't like him.

73
00:06:02,490 --> 00:06:03,995
I don't get why.

74
00:06:04,130 --> 00:06:05,562
He's really nice.

75
00:06:05,697 --> 00:06:07,356
Besides that,
don't you think Robin

76
00:06:07,491 --> 00:06:09,361
would want you looking out
for his kid brother?

77
00:06:09,496 --> 00:06:11,963
But that doesn't mean letting
him boink my little sister.

78
00:06:12,099 --> 00:06:13,570
-Ow.
-Don't be gross, jizz mopper.

79
00:06:15,906 --> 00:06:17,259
Welcome back to<i> Night Flight.</i>

80
00:06:17,342 --> 00:06:19,004
Here's German band FEX

81
00:06:19,139 --> 00:06:21,505
with their new hit,
"Subways of Your Mind."

82
00:06:27,349 --> 00:06:28,381
Night, Son.

83
00:06:28,516 --> 00:06:30,579
I'm off to bed.

84
00:06:30,714 --> 00:06:32,386
Night.

85
00:06:32,522 --> 00:06:34,551
Don't stay up too late.

86
00:06:34,686 --> 00:06:36,989
Yeah, sure.

If you try to touch me,
I'll scratch your face.

94
00:07:41,955 --> 00:07:43,759
This face?

95
00:07:55,337 --> 00:07:57,003
Hey.

96
00:08:04,910 --> 00:08:06,177
Still not my thing.

97
00:08:07,417 --> 00:08:08,349
Don't tell Dad.

98
00:08:08,485 --> 00:08:09,955
Fuck off, slap-dick.

99
00:08:10,090 --> 00:08:11,116
I'm no narc.

100
00:08:13,917 --> 00:08:16,389
You okay?

101
00:08:16,525 --> 00:08:17,925
I'm fine.

102
00:08:19,296 --> 00:08:20,991
No, I-I mean...

103
00:08:21,126 --> 00:08:22,897
I don't want to talk about it.

104
00:08:28,366 --> 00:08:30,509
It's okay
that you feel this way.

105
00:08:32,236 --> 00:08:34,403
You don't know how I feel.

106
00:08:36,445 --> 00:08:37,912
No, but...

107
00:08:39,147 --> 00:08:42,477
I know, however you feel,
it's okay.

108
00:11:24,751 --> 00:11:26,311
Hey, what are you doing?

109
00:11:27,813 --> 00:11:29,347
Hey.

110
00:11:31,147 --> 00:11:32,790
Hey, Gwen.

111
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:36,722
Gwen, wake up. What are you...

112
00:11:36,858 --> 00:11:38,730
Why are you so cold?

113
00:11:40,166 --> 00:11:41,832
Finn?

114
00:11:43,501 --> 00:11:44,831
It's okay.

115
00:11:44,966 --> 00:11:46,298
You were sleepwalking again.

116
00:11:48,036 --> 00:11:51,006
Jesus. Your skin is like ice.

117
00:11:52,301 --> 00:11:54,405
I had a bad dream.

118
00:11:57,817 --> 00:12:00,913
It's okay.
Just... go back to bed.

119
00:12:01,048 --> 00:12:02,917
I-I said I had a bad dream.

120
00:12:03,053 --> 00:12:05,548
I heard you.
Just go back to bed.

121
00:12:14,091 --> 00:12:15,767
Hey, witch.

122
00:12:25,872 --> 00:12:27,174
Hey, Gwen.

123
00:12:28,105 --> 00:12:29,942
Hey, Ernie.

124
00:12:30,078 --> 00:12:31,844
Check it out.

125
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:33,109
Oh, choice.

126
00:12:33,245 --> 00:12:34,951
I can't believe it.

127
00:12:36,153 --> 00:12:38,488
So, uh, you're into
a lot of that...

128
00:12:38,624 --> 00:12:41,018
that woo-woo stuff, right?

129
00:12:41,153 --> 00:12:43,387
What? You mean ghosts?

130
00:12:43,523 --> 00:12:45,764
Spirits?
Glimpses of the world beyond?

131
00:12:47,666 --> 00:12:49,393
-Yeah.
-Okay, then.

132
00:12:49,529 --> 00:12:52,496
Yeah, I believe in
all that woo-woo stuff.

133
00:12:55,131 --> 00:12:56,874
Cool.

134
00:12:57,943 --> 00:13:00,603
Uh, I-I brought you
something else.

135
00:13:01,944 --> 00:13:04,115
Ernesto, is this<i> lotería?</i>

136
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:05,574
Yeah.

137
00:13:05,710 --> 00:13:07,452
My<i> abuela</i> sells them
in her shop,

138
00:13:07,587 --> 00:13:09,117
and I thought they looked cool.

139
00:13:10,117 --> 00:13:11,248
They're like tarot.

140
00:13:11,383 --> 00:13:12,789
These are beautiful.

141
00:13:12,925 --> 00:13:14,815
I mean, you can use them
like tarot.

142
00:13:14,951 --> 00:13:18,253
If you have the sight,
they can show you things.

143
00:13:18,389 --> 00:13:21,232
And you have that, right?

144
00:13:21,367 --> 00:13:23,023
Have what?

145
00:13:23,159 --> 00:13:25,659
Oh, I mean, like, you have...
you have dreams and stuff,

146
00:13:25,795 --> 00:13:28,169
and they...
they show you things?

147
00:13:30,334 --> 00:13:32,470
Where did you hear that?

148
00:13:33,940 --> 00:13:36,177
My parents.

149
00:13:36,312 --> 00:13:38,108
Back, you know,
they said that the police got

150
00:13:38,244 --> 00:13:40,783
an anonymous call where...

151
00:13:40,918 --> 00:13:43,745
where, um, Robin's body was.

152
00:13:44,656 --> 00:13:46,621
But they say it was you.

153
00:13:46,757 --> 00:13:49,854
That you dreamed it.

154
00:13:49,989 --> 00:13:51,794
Or-or something.

155
00:13:51,929 --> 00:13:54,195
I don't like talking about that.

156
00:13:55,434 --> 00:13:57,799
Mm, why not?

157
00:13:57,934 --> 00:14:00,271
'Cause it's weird.

158
00:14:00,407 --> 00:14:01,433
I'm weird.

159
00:14:02,641 --> 00:14:05,338
Maybe I like weird.

160
00:14:31,134 --> 00:14:33,102
I'm sorry, but I can't help you.

161
00:17:54,199 --> 00:17:55,799
Hello?

162
00:17:56,899 --> 00:17:59,071
Hello?

163
00:17:59,206 --> 00:18:01,469
Who's this?

164
00:18:01,604 --> 00:18:03,343
Hope. Hope Adler.

165
00:18:03,479 --> 00:18:06,176
Who is this?

166
00:18:06,311 --> 00:18:08,445
My name is Gwen.

167
00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:11,089
Where are you calling from?

168
00:18:12,757 --> 00:18:14,125
Alpine Lake.

169
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:17,487
It-it's a youth camp
in the mountains.

170
00:18:17,622 --> 00:18:20,193
How did you get this number?

171
00:18:20,328 --> 00:18:24,062
I, um... I had these dreams.

172
00:18:24,198 --> 00:18:26,202
Seven numbers.

173
00:18:26,337 --> 00:18:28,939
No area code,
so this call is local.

174
00:18:29,074 --> 00:18:30,902
You're here in Colorado, right?

175
00:18:31,038 --> 00:18:32,066
Yes.

176
00:18:34,738 --> 00:18:37,447
The numbers were carved in ice.

177
00:18:37,583 --> 00:18:38,912
By boys.

178
00:18:39,047 --> 00:18:40,584
Underwater.

179
00:18:40,719 --> 00:18:42,583
Yes. Yes!

180
00:18:42,719 --> 00:18:46,322
I had the same dreams,
but the boys carved letters.

181
00:18:47,451 --> 00:18:49,527
Who is this?

182
00:18:49,662 --> 00:18:51,262
Who are you?

183
00:18:51,397 --> 00:18:53,208
My name is Gwen.

184
00:18:53,291 --> 00:18:54,930
Hello?

185
00:18:55,066 --> 00:18:56,894
I-I said my name is Gwen.

186
00:18:57,029 --> 00:18:59,166
Hello? Can you hear me?

187
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:13,349
You shouldn't be here.

188
00:19:41,577 --> 00:19:44,208
Hey.

189
00:19:44,343 --> 00:19:45,813
Hey, Gwen.

190
00:19:45,948 --> 00:19:46,976
Gwen.

191
00:19:52,682 --> 00:19:54,186
Am I really here?

192
00:19:54,321 --> 00:19:56,625
You're okay.

193
00:19:56,761 --> 00:19:59,559
You were sleepwalking again.
You came here in your sleep.

194
00:19:59,695 --> 00:20:01,727
I heard you leave,
and I followed you.

195
00:20:04,128 --> 00:20:06,435
I feel like I'm crazy.
What the hell?

196
00:20:06,570 --> 00:20:08,381
-Hey, hey. Look at me. Hey, hey.
-What the hell?!

197
00:20:08,464 --> 00:20:10,538
You're okay,
you're okay, you're okay.

198
00:20:13,836 --> 00:20:15,576
I-I was on the phone.

199
00:20:17,881 --> 00:20:18,909
Finn.

200
00:20:21,019 --> 00:20:22,847
I was talking to Mom.

201
00:20:26,684 --> 00:20:27,922
It was just a dream.

202
00:20:28,057 --> 00:20:29,927
N-No, it was...

203
00:20:30,063 --> 00:20:33,092
a dream, yeah, but it was her.

204
00:20:33,228 --> 00:20:35,095
She called me.

205
00:20:35,230 --> 00:20:37,228
From a youth camp.

206
00:20:37,364 --> 00:20:39,270
A youth camp?

207
00:20:40,967 --> 00:20:43,538
She reached out to me
from there for a reason.

208
00:20:45,377 --> 00:20:48,103
Come on.
Let's get you out of here.

209
00:21:17,167 --> 00:21:19,668
-What's this?
-Camp Alpine Lake.

210
00:21:19,804 --> 00:21:22,274
The camp Mom called from.

211
00:21:22,410 --> 00:21:23,439
We have to go there.

212
00:21:23,574 --> 00:21:26,377
Gwen, stop this.

213
00:21:26,513 --> 00:21:28,544
It was just a dream.

214
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:30,146
About a real place.

215
00:21:30,281 --> 00:21:32,223
A place I found.
It's why I had the dream.

216
00:21:32,358 --> 00:21:33,990
It's a Christian youth camp

217
00:21:34,125 --> 00:21:35,485
up near Silverthorne.

218
00:21:35,620 --> 00:21:37,086
What's this?

219
00:21:37,222 --> 00:21:38,820
They're accepting
applications for CITs

220
00:21:38,956 --> 00:21:40,259
for middle school winter camp.

221
00:21:40,394 --> 00:21:41,822
What's a CIT?

222
00:21:41,957 --> 00:21:43,829
Counselor in training.

223
00:21:44,936 --> 00:21:46,602
No...

224
00:21:46,738 --> 00:21:48,932
I'm not going to be a counselor
for junior highers

225
00:21:49,068 --> 00:21:51,299
at some weird Jesus camp
you dreamed about.

226
00:21:51,434 --> 00:21:53,869
No, you're going to be
a counselor in training.

227
00:21:54,005 --> 00:21:55,709
-No, I'm not.
-Come on.

228
00:21:55,844 --> 00:21:57,608
Dad has been hounding you
to get a job,

229
00:21:57,743 --> 00:21:59,273
and this is a job that pays.

230
00:21:59,408 --> 00:22:01,346
-And we can find out what Mom...
-I said no.

231
00:22:03,551 --> 00:22:05,315
What's going on in here?

232
00:22:05,451 --> 00:22:10,218
Uh, Gwen wants us to get jobs
at some Christian winter camp.

233
00:22:12,425 --> 00:22:14,662
Not Camp Alpine.

234
00:22:15,764 --> 00:22:17,759
Hmm.

235
00:22:17,895 --> 00:22:19,095
Your mother worked there.

236
00:22:22,038 --> 00:22:23,473
Wh-When?

237
00:22:24,476 --> 00:22:26,801
Uh, it was
long before I met her.

238
00:22:26,936 --> 00:22:29,806
It closed in '58.

239
00:22:29,941 --> 00:22:32,146
How'd you hear about this place?

240
00:22:32,281 --> 00:22:34,478
Uh, um, I-I had...

241
00:22:34,614 --> 00:22:36,178
Some kids at school.

242
00:22:36,313 --> 00:22:39,489
Said it was a good way
to, uh, make some money.

243
00:22:41,487 --> 00:22:43,526
Christian camp.

244
00:22:45,924 --> 00:22:48,356
You guys, you know I don't...

245
00:22:48,491 --> 00:22:50,693
much like any of that
religion stuff, you know?

246
00:22:50,829 --> 00:22:53,228
It-it's just a job, Dad.

247
00:22:58,868 --> 00:23:00,471
Mom worked there.

248
00:23:00,606 --> 00:23:02,479
I'm not crazy.

249
00:23:03,974 --> 00:23:06,516
I never said you were crazy.

250
00:23:08,886 --> 00:23:10,726
Don't let me hear
you took that thing

251
00:23:10,815 --> 00:23:12,914
any faster than 55.

252
00:23:13,049 --> 00:23:14,425
Y-Yes, sir.

253
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:16,326
I would like my daughter back
unscathed.

254
00:23:16,461 --> 00:23:18,660
-Do you understand?
-Yes, sir.

255
00:23:20,331 --> 00:23:21,898
Do you say anything else?

256
00:23:22,033 --> 00:23:23,197
Yes, sir.

257
00:23:23,333 --> 00:23:25,194
Uh, uh, I-I mean...

258
00:23:26,901 --> 00:23:29,137
I don't like the way
he looks at her.

259
00:23:29,272 --> 00:23:31,266
Yeah. Me, neither.

260
00:23:32,572 --> 00:23:34,269
Damn it. Wait.

261
00:23:35,542 --> 00:23:36,711
"Wait," what?

262
00:23:48,718 --> 00:23:49,785
Good.

263
00:23:49,921 --> 00:23:52,089
Go look after your sister.

264
00:23:53,794 --> 00:23:55,427
Do me a favor while I'm gone.

265
00:23:55,563 --> 00:23:57,265
Yeah, anything, Son.

266
00:23:57,401 --> 00:23:59,503
Don't get drunk.

267
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:02,739
Hey, come on.

268
00:24:02,875 --> 00:24:05,608
When are you gonna believe
I'm done with all of that?

269
00:24:05,743 --> 00:24:08,641
In two weeks,
I get my three-year chip.

270
00:24:08,776 --> 00:24:11,005
I'll have it when you get back.

271
00:24:11,140 --> 00:24:13,811
See you in a few weeks.

272
00:24:13,946 --> 00:24:15,751
Okay. Great.

273
00:24:15,886 --> 00:24:18,720
Finally get some peace and quiet
around this place.

274
00:24:27,061 --> 00:24:32,426
♪ A snapshot
in the family album ♪

275
00:24:37,072 --> 00:24:42,546
♪ Daddy, what else
did you leave for me? ♪

276
00:24:49,119 --> 00:24:52,655
♪ Daddy, what'd you leave
behind for me? ♪

277
00:24:56,929 --> 00:25:02,324
♪ All in all, it was
just a brick in the wall ♪

278
00:25:06,631 --> 00:25:11,168
♪ All in all, it was
all just bricks in the wall. ♪

279
00:25:43,837 --> 00:25:45,900
I can't see the road.

280
00:25:46,035 --> 00:25:48,074
This isn't safe.

281
00:25:48,209 --> 00:25:50,746
We could drive off a cliff
and not even see it.

282
00:25:52,976 --> 00:25:54,585
Stop the car.

283
00:25:56,651 --> 00:25:57,983
What are you doing?

284
00:25:58,119 --> 00:25:59,453
I'm gonna run
in front of the car

285
00:25:59,588 --> 00:26:01,684
so I can see the road.

286
00:26:01,819 --> 00:26:03,422
Just follow me.

287
00:26:20,838 --> 00:26:22,107
Follow me!

288
00:26:28,878 --> 00:26:30,318
Mando!

289
00:26:30,454 --> 00:26:32,986
I found your stray CITs.

290
00:26:43,702 --> 00:26:45,563
Straight ahead about 20 yards.

291
00:26:45,699 --> 00:26:47,495
Park anywhere.

292
00:26:52,243 --> 00:26:53,407
Thank you.

293
00:26:53,543 --> 00:26:54,940
You must be the Blakes.

294
00:26:55,076 --> 00:26:56,404
Yeah, how'd you know?

295
00:26:56,540 --> 00:26:58,641
Oh, they closed I-6
at Silverthorne.

296
00:26:58,776 --> 00:27:01,745
You're the only ones
who didn't get the call in time.

297
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:02,979
I'm Armando.

298
00:27:03,114 --> 00:27:04,953
Or just Mando, if you like.

299
00:27:05,088 --> 00:27:07,955
Come on. Come with me.
Let's get you inside.

300
00:27:09,726 --> 00:27:11,289
What about all the kids?

301
00:27:11,424 --> 00:27:13,595
Aren't they supposed
to arrive tomorrow?

302
00:27:13,730 --> 00:27:15,799
Camp's canceled.

303
00:27:15,935 --> 00:27:19,328
They won't plow the roads
until the storm passes.

304
00:27:19,463 --> 00:27:21,601
How many people made it here?

305
00:27:21,736 --> 00:27:23,366
Just you three.

306
00:27:23,501 --> 00:27:26,167
Support staff has only
been here a week,

307
00:27:26,303 --> 00:27:28,077
but otherwise, you're it.

308
00:27:28,212 --> 00:27:31,407
I'm sorry to say it,
but for now you're stuck here.

309
00:27:43,253 --> 00:27:44,959
Come on, Gwen.

310
00:27:45,924 --> 00:27:47,962
You're with me.

311
00:27:49,031 --> 00:27:51,130
This is it.
Take any bunk you want.

312
00:27:51,266 --> 00:27:55,299
Heaters are on,
so just give 'em a few minutes.

313
00:27:55,434 --> 00:27:58,938
It will be toasty in no time,
all right?

314
00:27:59,074 --> 00:28:01,679
Have a good night, kids.
Sweet dreams.

315
00:28:01,814 --> 00:28:04,147
<i>I got to sleep in here alone?</i>

316
00:28:04,282 --> 00:28:05,406
Afraid so.

317
00:28:05,541 --> 00:28:06,633
State law requires
separate housing

318
00:28:06,716 --> 00:28:08,517
for male and female minors.

319
00:28:08,653 --> 00:28:10,083
I'd stay in here with you,

320
00:28:10,219 --> 00:28:12,954
but I'm not a registered
counselor, so no can do.

321
00:28:14,488 --> 00:28:18,025
But my cabin is just over there,
if you need anything.

322
00:28:19,890 --> 00:28:21,494
Night.

323
00:31:11,001 --> 00:31:13,200
I'm sorry, but I can't help you.

324
00:31:40,322 --> 00:31:41,565
Who is this?

325
00:32:29,205 --> 00:32:31,304
Hello?

326
00:32:31,439 --> 00:32:32,773
Is anyone there?

327
00:32:32,908 --> 00:32:35,018
Hello, Finney.

328
00:33:12,553 --> 00:33:16,290
Hell is not flames, Finney.

329
00:33:17,288 --> 00:33:18,451
It's ice.

330
00:33:30,769 --> 00:33:33,835
Nothing burns like the cold.

331
00:33:52,828 --> 00:33:54,697
Gwen. Gwen!

332
00:33:56,525 --> 00:33:58,295
Gwen, Gwen, Gwen!

333
00:33:58,430 --> 00:33:59,861
Hey, Gwen, Gwen, look at me!

334
00:33:59,996 --> 00:34:02,035
Hey, hey, look at me!
Wake up! Wake up!

335
00:34:02,170 --> 00:34:04,597
Hey, hey.

336
00:34:04,733 --> 00:34:07,435
What's happening to me?

337
00:34:07,570 --> 00:34:09,340
Oh, God, I feel crazy.

338
00:34:09,475 --> 00:34:10,715
You were dreaming. You're okay.

339
00:34:10,841 --> 00:34:12,409
-You're okay.
-I feel crazy.

340
00:34:12,544 --> 00:34:14,045
You're okay. You're okay.

341
00:34:18,022 --> 00:34:20,722
You're okay. You're okay.

342
00:34:20,857 --> 00:34:22,455
You're okay.

343
00:34:54,251 --> 00:34:55,917
Gwen.

344
00:34:58,521 --> 00:35:00,493
I had a bad dream.

345
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:04,299
Okay. Y-You... you all right?

346
00:35:08,763 --> 00:35:11,064
Here, uh... lie down.

347
00:35:32,927 --> 00:35:34,461
Jesus...

348
00:35:35,895 --> 00:35:38,896
please don't let me have
another dream tonight.

349
00:35:39,032 --> 00:35:40,830
Please.

350
00:35:41,870 --> 00:35:43,936
Hey.

351
00:35:44,071 --> 00:35:46,608
Y-You okay?

352
00:35:46,743 --> 00:35:48,270
Yeah.

353
00:35:48,405 --> 00:35:50,444
Did I wake you?

354
00:35:51,682 --> 00:35:53,381
No.

355
00:35:54,819 --> 00:35:57,652
Was that for real?

356
00:35:57,787 --> 00:35:59,682
What?

357
00:35:59,817 --> 00:36:03,820
You talk to Jesus
just like that?

358
00:36:05,256 --> 00:36:06,620
Yeah.

359
00:36:06,756 --> 00:36:08,997
You think it's weird?

360
00:36:09,132 --> 00:36:11,828
Uh, no. No, not-not at all.

361
00:36:12,961 --> 00:36:15,469
I th... I think it's hot.

362
00:36:16,936 --> 00:36:20,168
You think it's hot
that I talk to Jesus?

363
00:36:20,304 --> 00:36:23,210
Yeah. I mean, it might even
be hotter if you called him

364
00:36:23,345 --> 00:36:25,577
Jesús.

365
00:36:25,713 --> 00:36:28,548
You know, my mom is
Catholic as hell.

366
00:36:28,684 --> 00:36:31,914
She'd love me dating
somebody who prays.

367
00:36:33,517 --> 00:36:35,853
We're dating?

368
00:36:35,989 --> 00:36:39,555
Uh, um, I mean, I was...
I was just saying that...

369
00:36:39,691 --> 00:36:41,858
I'm a good Christian girl?

370
00:36:43,459 --> 00:36:44,731
Sure.

371
00:36:44,867 --> 00:36:46,533
Why not?

372
00:36:49,700 --> 00:36:51,901
My mom was Christian, too.

373
00:36:53,238 --> 00:36:56,671
Dad didn't want us brought up
in the church, but...

374
00:36:56,806 --> 00:36:59,040
I asked a lot of questions.

375
00:37:00,342 --> 00:37:04,045
And when he wasn't around,
she answered.

376
00:37:05,147 --> 00:37:07,950
Did she know
about your dream thing?

377
00:37:10,059 --> 00:37:12,152
I got it from her.

378
00:37:13,998 --> 00:37:16,057
It drove her crazy.

379
00:37:18,030 --> 00:37:20,765
I'm scared the same thing
will happen to me.

380
00:37:22,170 --> 00:37:24,205
It won't.

381
00:37:24,340 --> 00:37:26,573
You're too strong for that.

382
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:35,747
You don't think I'm a freak?

383
00:37:36,946 --> 00:37:39,449
What's wrong with being a freak?

384
00:37:39,585 --> 00:37:41,852
I'm a freak like my mom.

385
00:37:43,060 --> 00:37:45,694
Were you close to her?

386
00:37:45,829 --> 00:37:47,931
Yeah.

387
00:37:48,066 --> 00:37:51,090
I think about her every day.

388
00:37:51,226 --> 00:37:53,765
I can still see her face
so clearly.

389
00:37:55,071 --> 00:37:57,131
She was beautiful.

390
00:37:59,067 --> 00:38:02,576
I think... you're beautiful.

391
00:38:10,919 --> 00:38:13,715
What about me?
Do you think I'm beautiful?

392
00:38:13,851 --> 00:38:15,786
Finn, you rotting shit stain.

393
00:38:15,921 --> 00:38:18,319
Have you been listening
this whole time?

394
00:38:19,890 --> 00:38:21,957
Well, I'm still right here,

395
00:38:22,093 --> 00:38:24,796
so it's not like
I had any choice.

396
00:38:26,634 --> 00:38:28,371
I-I thought he was asleep.

397
00:38:29,404 --> 00:38:31,099
Told you Duran Duran is a date.

398
00:38:46,621 --> 00:38:49,986
Ernesto, I need to talk
to Gwen alone.

399
00:38:50,121 --> 00:38:53,862
If it's about last night,
he knows.

400
00:38:53,997 --> 00:38:55,098
Knows what?

401
00:38:55,233 --> 00:38:56,593
Why do you think he's here?

402
00:38:56,728 --> 00:38:58,631
He came to help us investigate.

403
00:38:58,766 --> 00:39:00,698
Wait, you told him
about your dreams?

404
00:39:00,834 --> 00:39:04,196
Hmm. Yeah, Finn,
I know about her dreams.

405
00:39:04,332 --> 00:39:06,574
And about the calls
that you get.

406
00:39:07,806 --> 00:39:09,674
-Gwen.
-We can trust him.

407
00:39:09,810 --> 00:39:13,611
Okay, but it wasn't
yours to tell.

408
00:39:13,746 --> 00:39:15,109
Okay, I haven't told anyone.

409
00:39:15,245 --> 00:39:16,776
Because you don't have
any friends.

410
00:39:16,912 --> 00:39:19,151
I... I have friends.

411
00:39:19,286 --> 00:39:20,653
Name one.

412
00:39:20,788 --> 00:39:22,317
One you've brought home
to hang out.

413
00:39:22,453 --> 00:39:24,622
One you've even mentioned
in a conversation at all.

414
00:39:24,757 --> 00:39:26,953
Gwen, it wasn't yours to tell.

415
00:39:27,089 --> 00:39:28,726
I have to tell somebody, Finn.

416
00:39:28,862 --> 00:39:30,695
You never want to hear
about my dreams.

417
00:39:30,831 --> 00:39:33,335
-That's not true.
-See this?

418
00:39:33,471 --> 00:39:36,032
This happened last night
in my dream.

419
00:39:37,208 --> 00:39:40,041
One of the kids grabbed me.

420
00:39:40,177 --> 00:39:42,776
In... in your dream?

421
00:39:42,911 --> 00:39:45,571
-Gwen, this is bad.
-Morning, campers!

422
00:39:45,707 --> 00:39:50,053
Another glorious God-given day
here at Camp Alpine Lake.

423
00:39:50,188 --> 00:39:51,844
Breakfast in the mess hall.

424
00:39:51,980 --> 00:39:54,050
Come get some grub!

425
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:20,549
News reports say this is
the worst blizzard since '46.

426
00:40:21,845 --> 00:40:23,277
Denver is shut down.

427
00:40:23,413 --> 00:40:25,686
Best-case scenario is
two days, maybe three.

428
00:40:25,821 --> 00:40:27,916
It could be longer.

429
00:40:28,051 --> 00:40:29,625
You've met my niece Mustang.

430
00:40:29,761 --> 00:40:32,589
She works the stables
and in the kitchen with me.

431
00:40:32,724 --> 00:40:35,091
Mustang? Like the car?

432
00:40:36,198 --> 00:40:37,962
Like the horse.

433
00:40:40,967 --> 00:40:42,968
Uh, how many other people
are here?

434
00:40:43,103 --> 00:40:46,606
Just Kenneth and Barbara,
who run the offices.

435
00:40:46,741 --> 00:40:48,408
Rest of the support staff
got out

436
00:40:48,544 --> 00:40:51,411
before they closed the roads.

437
00:40:51,546 --> 00:40:54,877
So, how did everyone sleep?

438
00:40:55,012 --> 00:40:56,618
-Fine.
-Fine.

439
00:40:57,917 --> 00:40:59,646
I noticed you slept
with the boys.

440
00:40:59,781 --> 00:41:02,349
I can lose my camp license
for that. Don't do it again.

441
00:41:04,758 --> 00:41:08,955
Now, for the $64,000 question:

442
00:41:09,090 --> 00:41:12,095
Why are you guys here?

443
00:41:13,829 --> 00:41:15,862
To be camp CITs.

444
00:41:15,998 --> 00:41:17,670
No, I...

445
00:41:17,806 --> 00:41:19,466
I get that.

446
00:41:19,602 --> 00:41:22,469
I mean, none of you
ever attended here as campers,

447
00:41:22,605 --> 00:41:25,847
and none of you listed churches
on your applications,

448
00:41:25,982 --> 00:41:29,343
so that means you didn't get
one of our flyers.

449
00:41:30,914 --> 00:41:33,853
So, why are you here?

450
00:41:40,154 --> 00:41:42,191
Huh?

451
00:41:49,635 --> 00:41:50,936
Our mom went here.

452
00:41:52,067 --> 00:41:54,608
Oh. Camper or counselor?

453
00:41:54,743 --> 00:41:56,879
Counselor.
Her name was Hope Adler.

454
00:41:57,014 --> 00:41:58,548
"Was"?

455
00:41:59,647 --> 00:42:01,347
She died seven years ago.

456
00:42:01,482 --> 00:42:03,520
Mm. I'm sorry.

457
00:42:04,849 --> 00:42:06,149
Do you remember her?

458
00:42:07,391 --> 00:42:09,222
A lot of kids come through here.

459
00:42:11,054 --> 00:42:12,419
Do you know her camp name?

460
00:42:13,788 --> 00:42:16,326
Support staff and counselors,
they get camp names.

461
00:42:16,462 --> 00:42:20,295
It's easier for the campers
to remember who's who.

462
00:42:25,208 --> 00:42:27,038
Starlight.

463
00:42:28,710 --> 00:42:30,640
You're Starlight's kids?

464
00:42:30,776 --> 00:42:33,044
You do remember her.

465
00:42:34,151 --> 00:42:35,308
Very well.

466
00:42:35,443 --> 00:42:38,247
Sh-She was a true light,
that one.

467
00:42:42,251 --> 00:42:45,287
Um, I-I'm sorry you lost her.

468
00:42:47,695 --> 00:42:50,391
May I ask how she passed?

469
00:42:52,732 --> 00:42:54,835
She killed herself.

470
00:42:57,739 --> 00:43:00,874
I-I... I'm so sorry.

471
00:43:06,150 --> 00:43:08,616
Look, I...

472
00:43:08,752 --> 00:43:11,544
I-I'm just glad
you guys found us.

473
00:43:12,757 --> 00:43:14,787
After you eat,
you should call your families

474
00:43:14,922 --> 00:43:17,120
and let 'em know you're okay.

475
00:43:17,255 --> 00:43:20,221
There's a phone
in the camp offices.

476
00:43:20,357 --> 00:43:22,797
Wait, what about
the outside pay phone?

477
00:43:22,932 --> 00:43:25,434
That thing's deader than disco.

478
00:43:25,569 --> 00:43:27,527
Hasn't worked in over a decade.

479
00:43:34,569 --> 00:43:37,245
That dead pay phone rang
last night.

480
00:43:37,380 --> 00:43:39,311
Did you answer it?

481
00:43:39,446 --> 00:43:40,911
Yeah.

482
00:43:41,046 --> 00:43:42,742
I'm pretty sure it was him.

483
00:43:42,878 --> 00:43:44,185
Him?

484
00:43:44,320 --> 00:43:46,352
Like, "him" him?

485
00:43:46,487 --> 00:43:47,783
Oh, my God.

486
00:43:47,919 --> 00:43:49,751
What'd he say?

487
00:43:49,886 --> 00:43:52,453
What'd he want?

488
00:43:54,897 --> 00:43:56,657
-What?
-It's ringing again?

489
00:43:56,793 --> 00:44:00,065
Go call Dad.
I'll meet you when I'm done.

490
00:44:09,073 --> 00:44:10,805
You got something to say?

491
00:44:10,940 --> 00:44:13,144
Then say it.

492
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:15,377
It's cold here.

493
00:44:17,683 --> 00:44:19,381
Who is this?

494
00:44:21,117 --> 00:44:22,989
I don't remember.

495
00:44:23,955 --> 00:44:25,857
What happened to you?

496
00:44:25,992 --> 00:44:27,925
We don't know.

497
00:44:28,060 --> 00:44:30,192
You don't remember anything?

498
00:44:30,327 --> 00:44:31,761
There's three of us.

499
00:44:31,897 --> 00:44:34,193
Okay. Where are you?

500
00:44:34,329 --> 00:44:35,666
It's cold here.

501
00:44:35,801 --> 00:44:37,630
It's cold where?

502
00:44:38,939 --> 00:44:40,677
And it's dark here.

503
00:44:42,204 --> 00:44:43,809
Tell me where you are.

504
00:44:43,944 --> 00:44:45,748
We don't know.

505
00:44:47,812 --> 00:44:49,748
My name is Finn.

506
00:44:49,883 --> 00:44:51,820
Help us, Finn.

507
00:44:52,922 --> 00:44:55,256
You have to try
to remember something.

508
00:44:55,391 --> 00:44:57,791
How did you die?

509
00:44:57,926 --> 00:45:00,527
We don't remember.

510
00:45:00,663 --> 00:45:02,560
We're scared, Finn.

511
00:45:02,696 --> 00:45:04,494
I understand.

512
00:45:04,630 --> 00:45:07,396
-Okay, what do you...
-We're not supposed to be here.

513
00:45:08,867 --> 00:45:10,199
What do you mean?

514
00:45:10,335 --> 00:45:12,167
This isn't where we belong.

515
00:45:12,302 --> 00:45:14,744
We weren't supposed to be here.

516
00:45:17,043 --> 00:45:19,545
Something bad happened to you?

517
00:45:19,681 --> 00:45:22,548
Help us. Please help us.

518
00:45:22,683 --> 00:45:24,385
Tell me.

519
00:45:24,521 --> 00:45:26,215
Tell me how I can help.

520
00:45:26,351 --> 00:45:27,823
Find us, Finn. Please, Finn.

Welcome back to KMGH News.

533
00:46:12,663 --> 00:46:15,103
The blizzard brought
the entire area to a standstill

534
00:46:15,239 --> 00:46:17,797
as heavy winds and drifts
made all the roads impassable.

535
00:46:17,932 --> 00:46:19,890
So much so that police

536
00:46:19,973 --> 00:46:21,810
in several cities issued curfews

537
00:46:21,946 --> 00:46:24,139
against the vehicles
being on the road.

538
00:46:24,274 --> 00:46:26,077
And the restrictions still stand

539
00:46:26,213 --> 00:46:28,283
to those who violate
the order...

540
00:46:28,418 --> 00:46:30,049
Yeah, Jake, hey.

541
00:46:30,185 --> 00:46:33,088
Listen, I need to call in
that favor.

542
00:46:33,223 --> 00:46:36,991
Has the company fleet
finished plowing the property?

543
00:46:49,431 --> 00:46:52,107
Excuse me.

544
00:46:52,243 --> 00:46:54,767
Do you have any literature
on the history of Alpine Lake?

545
00:46:57,009 --> 00:47:00,212
Uh, we have a brochure.

546
00:47:01,146 --> 00:47:03,844
Damn. Nothing more in-depth?

547
00:47:03,980 --> 00:47:08,188
No, there is no published
history of Camp Alpine Lake.

548
00:47:08,323 --> 00:47:10,921
We are a youth camp,
not a historical society.

549
00:47:11,057 --> 00:47:13,627
Barbara, these are guests.

550
00:47:13,763 --> 00:47:15,357
No, Kenneth,

551
00:47:15,493 --> 00:47:17,296
this is the young lady
who decided

552
00:47:17,431 --> 00:47:21,398
to sneak into the boys' cabin
last night.

553
00:47:21,533 --> 00:47:24,136
So, what exactly
can we help you with, sweetie?

554
00:47:24,272 --> 00:47:27,172
Look, we just want to know
about some kids

555
00:47:27,308 --> 00:47:31,871
that may have been
killed here in the past.

556
00:47:32,006 --> 00:47:33,711
You don't need to hear
anything about that.

557
00:47:33,847 --> 00:47:35,449
We don't?

558
00:47:35,585 --> 00:47:37,848
You don't.

559
00:47:37,984 --> 00:47:40,118
Philippians 4:8 tells us

560
00:47:40,253 --> 00:47:42,188
to think on things
that are lovely.

561
00:47:43,325 --> 00:47:45,224
Philippians 4:8 also says
to think on things

562
00:47:45,359 --> 00:47:48,161
that are true, just and honest,
right, Barb?

563
00:47:49,366 --> 00:47:50,890
Barbara.

564
00:47:51,025 --> 00:47:52,759
We don't know the specifics.

565
00:47:52,894 --> 00:47:55,771
This is not some haunted tour
or ghost camp.

566
00:47:55,906 --> 00:47:57,600
This is
a Christian organization.

567
00:47:57,736 --> 00:47:59,766
We don't discuss
those kinds of things here.

568
00:47:59,901 --> 00:48:02,670
But some fucked-up shit
did happen here, right?

569
00:48:04,280 --> 00:48:07,346
Have you always had
such a filthy, vulgar mouth?

570
00:48:07,481 --> 00:48:10,250
Have you always been
such a sanctimonious twat?

571
00:48:10,385 --> 00:48:14,187
Hey, hey, I-I think
you two should leave now.

572
00:48:16,054 --> 00:48:17,685
Let's go.

573
00:48:19,058 --> 00:48:20,787
I'll pray for you.

574
00:48:44,718 --> 00:48:46,613
Hello?

575
00:48:46,749 --> 00:48:48,620
Who is this?

576
00:48:48,755 --> 00:48:50,249
Hope.

577
00:48:50,384 --> 00:48:52,427
Uh, Hope Adler.

578
00:48:52,562 --> 00:48:54,056
Who is this?

579
00:48:54,191 --> 00:48:56,123
I can't see you.

580
00:48:56,259 --> 00:48:57,498
Where are you?

581
00:48:57,633 --> 00:48:59,496
Alpine Lake.

582
00:49:01,369 --> 00:49:04,231
It's a youth camp
in the mountains.

583
00:49:04,366 --> 00:49:06,134
It's so dark.

584
00:49:06,270 --> 00:49:08,400
How did you find me?

585
00:49:08,536 --> 00:49:11,039
I had these dreams.

586
00:49:11,175 --> 00:49:13,213
Seven numbers.

587
00:49:14,381 --> 00:49:16,543
No area code,
so this call is local.

588
00:49:16,678 --> 00:49:18,955
You're here in Colorado, right?

589
00:49:19,888 --> 00:49:22,024
Where were the numbers?

590
00:49:23,057 --> 00:49:25,120
The numbers were carved in ice.

591
00:49:25,255 --> 00:49:26,692
The ice of a lake?

592
00:49:26,827 --> 00:49:29,790
Yes. Yes!

593
00:49:29,926 --> 00:49:32,162
It's so hard
to remember things here.

594
00:49:32,297 --> 00:49:33,932
It's so cold and dark.

595
00:49:34,068 --> 00:49:36,372
Who is this?

596
00:49:36,507 --> 00:49:38,302
Who are you?

597
00:49:38,437 --> 00:49:40,333
We don't remember.

598
00:49:40,469 --> 00:49:42,143
Hello?

599
00:49:43,241 --> 00:49:44,944
Hello? Can you hear me?

600
00:49:48,075 --> 00:49:50,085
We're not supposed to be here.

601
00:51:16,034 --> 00:51:17,034
Ernesto!

602
00:51:17,134 --> 00:51:18,536
Wake up!

603
00:51:49,164 --> 00:51:51,272
You don't
have to answer it, man.

604
00:51:52,272 --> 00:51:53,901
Yes, I do.

605
00:51:56,676 --> 00:52:00,479
look after my sister.

606
00:52:01,619 --> 00:52:03,279
I promise.

607
00:52:36,583 --> 00:52:38,649
Hello, Finney.

608
00:52:41,616 --> 00:52:43,984
What do you want?

609
00:52:44,119 --> 00:52:49,324
It took me a long time,
but now I remember.

610
00:52:49,459 --> 00:52:51,523
You're dead.

611
00:52:51,658 --> 00:52:53,697
Oh, Finney.

612
00:52:54,762 --> 00:52:57,972
You of all people know

613
00:52:58,107 --> 00:53:01,034
that "dead" is just a word.

614
00:53:05,477 --> 00:53:07,480
Tell me why you're here.

615
00:53:09,009 --> 00:53:11,385
Why do you think I'm here?

616
00:53:12,453 --> 00:53:14,553
'Cause you knew we'd be trapped.

617
00:53:16,156 --> 00:53:18,055
Gwen?

618
00:53:18,190 --> 00:53:21,955
Gwen! Gwen!

619
00:54:24,695 --> 00:54:29,793
Did you think
that our story was over, Finney?

620
00:54:31,161 --> 00:54:35,795
Did you really believe
you could do what you did to me

621
00:54:35,930 --> 00:54:37,433
and that would be the end of it?

622
00:54:37,569 --> 00:54:39,336
I'm not afraid of you.

623
00:54:39,471 --> 00:54:41,006
And why should you be?

624
00:54:41,142 --> 00:54:42,673
You killed me.

625
00:54:42,808 --> 00:54:45,111
You won.

626
00:54:45,246 --> 00:54:46,478
Tell me what you want.

627
00:54:46,613 --> 00:54:50,311
What I have always
wanted with you.

628
00:54:50,446 --> 00:54:51,645
What?

629
00:54:51,780 --> 00:54:53,652
You want to scare me?

630
00:54:56,224 --> 00:54:59,324
You know as well as I do

631
00:54:59,460 --> 00:55:03,431
that fear is just the warm-up.

632
00:55:05,736 --> 00:55:07,193
Gwen!

633
00:55:08,137 --> 00:55:09,602
-Gwen!
-Hey!

634
00:55:09,737 --> 00:55:12,308
Hey! What are you doing?

635
00:55:13,441 --> 00:55:15,010
It's 3:00 in the morning.

636
00:55:15,146 --> 00:55:16,539
G-Gwen isn't in her dorm.

637
00:55:16,675 --> 00:55:18,307
I don't know where she is.

638
00:55:54,815 --> 00:55:57,353
Have you guessed what it is yet?

639
00:55:58,518 --> 00:56:03,656
What it is that I want from you?

640
00:56:05,620 --> 00:56:09,695
<i>"Want" isn't even
the right word.</i>

641
00:56:09,830 --> 00:56:14,161
<i>It's more of an insatiable need.</i>

642
00:56:15,799 --> 00:56:18,663
<i>So, have you got it yet?</i>

643
00:56:18,799 --> 00:56:20,267
<i>No?</i>

644
00:56:20,402 --> 00:56:23,335
<i>Fine.
I'll just tell you, Finney.</i>

645
00:56:24,676 --> 00:56:29,176
<i>What I want is this.</i>

646
00:56:31,714 --> 00:56:36,853
I want to hurt you

647
00:56:36,988 --> 00:56:40,757
in ways that
you can't even imagine.

648
00:56:40,893 --> 00:56:45,793
You will pay
for what you did to me.

649
00:56:45,928 --> 00:56:50,296
You made me kill my brother,

650
00:56:50,431 --> 00:56:55,834
the person on earth
that I loved the most!

651
00:56:55,970 --> 00:56:58,579
And then you killed me!

652
00:57:00,376 --> 00:57:05,113
<i>So now I am
going to destroy you, Finney...</i>

653
00:57:06,855 --> 00:57:10,954
<i>...by destroying
the thing you love most.</i>

654
00:57:12,723 --> 00:57:17,462
<i>Vengeance is mine.</i>

655
00:57:54,499 --> 00:57:57,264
Gwen! Gwen!

656
00:58:03,413 --> 00:58:05,481
Gwen!

657
00:58:23,527 --> 00:58:24,962
Help me!

658
00:58:25,859 --> 00:58:26,859
Help me!

659
00:59:04,373 --> 00:59:06,131
Hey. Hey. Hey, Gwen.

660
00:59:06,267 --> 00:59:08,368
Gwen, wake up. Gwen, wake up.

661
00:59:09,513 --> 00:59:11,578
Gwen, are you awake?

662
00:59:11,713 --> 00:59:13,505
Gwen, are you awake?

663
00:59:16,077 --> 00:59:17,685
Hey.

664
00:59:21,083 --> 00:59:22,591
You awake?

665
00:59:26,187 --> 00:59:28,927
You got the devil in you, child.

666
00:59:48,179 --> 00:59:52,114
I've been on this earth
a lot of years.

667
00:59:52,249 --> 00:59:55,284
Seen a lot of things
I can't explain.

668
00:59:55,419 --> 00:59:57,215
But I've never heard of anyone
who got dreams

669
00:59:57,350 --> 00:59:59,494
like the ones you describe.

670
00:59:59,629 --> 01:00:01,019
Where do you think
they come from?

671
01:00:01,154 --> 01:00:02,562
She's possessed.

672
01:00:02,697 --> 01:00:04,799
My God, Mando, isn't it obvious?

673
01:00:04,934 --> 01:00:07,762
I'm not possessed,
you judgmental cunt wagon.

674
01:00:09,704 --> 01:00:11,064
You think this is funny,
Mustang?

675
01:00:11,199 --> 01:00:13,404
You getting your horns clipped?

676
01:00:13,539 --> 01:00:14,907
Yeah, I do.

677
01:00:15,042 --> 01:00:16,155
Why don't you mind
your own business?

678
01:00:16,238 --> 01:00:17,912
Why don't you stop acting like

679
01:00:18,048 --> 01:00:19,197
this is the first creepy shit
you've seen up here?

680
01:00:19,280 --> 01:00:20,314
Stop it.

681
01:00:20,449 --> 01:00:21,978
Every single one of us

682
01:00:22,114 --> 01:00:24,585
has seen or heard things
around here.

683
01:00:24,721 --> 01:00:26,518
-You especially, Barb.
-Barbara.

684
01:00:26,653 --> 01:00:28,019
Shut up, both of you.

685
01:00:29,083 --> 01:00:32,627
Gwen, your dreams,

686
01:00:32,762 --> 01:00:35,389
are you saying
they tell you the future?

687
01:00:36,763 --> 01:00:38,560
Sometimes.

688
01:00:38,695 --> 01:00:41,829
Other times, it's the dead
showing me things from the past.

689
01:00:41,965 --> 01:00:43,228
What kind of things?

690
01:00:43,364 --> 01:00:45,839
Like the smallest missing boy.

691
01:00:47,143 --> 01:00:48,943
Felix?

692
01:00:49,079 --> 01:00:52,208
He was running for his life,
wearing a yellow down parka.

693
01:00:52,344 --> 01:00:55,478
A-And the tallest kid,
he wore a white parka.

694
01:00:55,613 --> 01:00:57,215
Spike.

695
01:00:57,350 --> 01:01:02,847
And scratched letters
into the ice above him: "WBH."

696
01:01:02,983 --> 01:01:05,921
I think his head was cut in half
on the tree stump in the woods.

697
01:01:06,056 --> 01:01:07,496
Lord in heaven.

698
01:01:07,631 --> 01:01:09,824
The third boy wore
a denim jacket.

699
01:01:09,960 --> 01:01:12,161
He was all burnt up,

700
01:01:12,297 --> 01:01:14,593
like he'd been cooked
inside an oven.

701
01:01:16,103 --> 01:01:18,062
-How'd you know that?
-Mando.

702
01:01:18,198 --> 01:01:19,740
No.

703
01:01:19,876 --> 01:01:23,808
Gwen, ignore everyone else
in the room.

704
01:01:23,943 --> 01:01:26,376
It's just you and me right now.

705
01:01:26,512 --> 01:01:30,378
The boy who was burnt up,
how did you hear about that?

706
01:01:31,452 --> 01:01:33,046
I just told you.

707
01:01:33,182 --> 01:01:34,954
He came to me in my dream.

708
01:01:35,953 --> 01:01:37,217
He wants me to find him.

709
01:01:37,352 --> 01:01:38,859
They all do.

710
01:01:38,994 --> 01:01:40,551
They can't rest
until they're found.

711
01:01:40,687 --> 01:01:43,230
-Whoa. You okay there, Mando?
-Mando?

712
01:01:46,333 --> 01:01:50,701
Burnt pieces of
Calvin O'Keefe's denim jacket

713
01:01:50,836 --> 01:01:52,538
were found by police.

714
01:01:52,674 --> 01:01:54,842
Only they had that detail.

715
01:01:54,977 --> 01:01:58,044
The police,
the former camp owner and me.

716
01:01:58,179 --> 01:02:00,413
What about
what we saw in the kitchen?

717
01:02:00,548 --> 01:02:03,011
That was no dream.

718
01:02:03,147 --> 01:02:04,717
Have you heard of The Grabber?

719
01:02:04,852 --> 01:02:06,820
Yeah. Who hasn't?

720
01:02:06,956 --> 01:02:09,149
He killed a bunch of kids,
and then...

721
01:02:09,284 --> 01:02:11,517
got killed when one escaped.

722
01:02:11,653 --> 01:02:14,686
Yeah, h-his name was
Finney something.

723
01:02:19,061 --> 01:02:20,802
Finney Blake.

724
01:02:22,272 --> 01:02:23,464
Finn Blake?

725
01:02:24,835 --> 01:02:27,402
Holy shit.

726
01:02:28,909 --> 01:02:32,277
Gwen, when did all this start?

727
01:02:32,413 --> 01:02:36,110
Weeks ago, when my mom called me
from this camp in a dream.

728
01:02:36,245 --> 01:02:37,886
She wanted me to come here.

729
01:02:38,021 --> 01:02:40,879
Wh-What does this have to do
with The Grabber?

730
01:02:41,014 --> 01:02:43,015
It wasn't the devil
attacking me in the kitchen.

731
01:02:43,150 --> 01:02:44,449
It was him.

732
01:02:44,584 --> 01:02:46,753
I could see him. He's here.

733
01:02:46,889 --> 01:02:50,622
This is from the last year
of camp before we closed down.

734
01:02:50,757 --> 01:02:53,593
I-I was just the camp cook
back then.

735
01:02:53,728 --> 01:02:57,300
There's me,
and there's your mom.

736
01:02:58,601 --> 01:03:02,741
After Harlan, the owner,
closed this place,

737
01:03:02,877 --> 01:03:05,142
I kept coming up here anyway,

738
01:03:05,277 --> 01:03:08,542
hiking the area,
looking for those kids.

739
01:03:10,218 --> 01:03:12,282
Then, when Harlan passed,
I bought this place

740
01:03:12,417 --> 01:03:15,549
in an estate sale for a song
and reopened it.

741
01:03:15,685 --> 01:03:17,589
I promised their parents
I wouldn't stop looking

742
01:03:17,725 --> 01:03:19,122
until I found them.

743
01:03:19,257 --> 01:03:22,797
So, every day,
weather permitting,

744
01:03:22,933 --> 01:03:26,358
I'm still out
walking the trails,

745
01:03:26,493 --> 01:03:28,367
digging up every mound of dirt.

746
01:03:28,503 --> 01:03:31,262
Not a single morning goes by
that I don't pray for help

747
01:03:31,398 --> 01:03:33,666
to find those boys.

748
01:03:33,801 --> 01:03:36,339
I didn't know it was you
he'd send.

749
01:03:37,809 --> 01:03:42,015
But now that you're here,
I'm not gonna pass up a chance

750
01:03:42,151 --> 01:03:44,150
to put those kids to rest
once and for all,

751
01:03:44,285 --> 01:03:48,153
for-for-for them,
for their families and for me.

752
01:03:49,755 --> 01:03:51,020
No fucking way.

753
01:03:51,155 --> 01:03:52,784
What is it with this family?

754
01:03:53,797 --> 01:03:56,293
It's him. It's The Grabber.

755
01:03:56,428 --> 01:03:57,781
-Are you sure?
-I know him,

756
01:03:57,864 --> 01:03:59,565
and I know his face.

757
01:03:59,700 --> 01:04:01,962
That's Bill.

758
01:04:02,097 --> 01:04:03,669
Wild Bill.

759
01:04:03,804 --> 01:04:04,972
He worked maintenance.

760
01:04:06,338 --> 01:04:08,305
We called him Wild Bill

761
01:04:08,440 --> 01:04:12,111
because he wore this
brown leather tool belt

762
01:04:12,246 --> 01:04:13,846
loose around his waist
like a gunslinger,

763
01:04:13,941 --> 01:04:17,314
and he got long, wavy hair
like Wild Bill Hickok.

764
01:04:19,588 --> 01:04:21,981
Wild Bill Hickok.

765
01:04:22,116 --> 01:04:23,617
"WBH."

766
01:04:24,485 --> 01:04:26,088
This is where he started.

767
01:04:26,223 --> 01:04:28,026
These boys were his first kills.

768
01:04:28,162 --> 01:04:29,856
And Wild Bill became
The Grabber.

769
01:04:29,992 --> 01:04:33,568
Mando, when did weird things
start happening around here?

770
01:04:33,704 --> 01:04:35,401
Mm, not until a few years ago.

771
01:04:35,536 --> 01:04:37,328
1978?

772
01:04:37,464 --> 01:04:39,069
Sounds about right.

773
01:04:39,204 --> 01:04:41,042
That's the year I killed him.

774
01:04:41,177 --> 01:04:43,138
And his spirit was set free
to come back here.

775
01:04:43,273 --> 01:04:45,474
Okay, but why would he do that?

776
01:04:46,877 --> 01:04:49,510
Maybe his spirit draws power
from the fear of his victims

777
01:04:49,646 --> 01:04:52,982
because their spirits
are not at rest.

778
01:04:53,118 --> 01:04:54,648
How do we find these boys?

779
01:04:56,018 --> 01:04:59,852
Their bodies are underwater,
in a frozen lake, I think.

780
01:04:59,987 --> 01:05:01,680
But didn't the police search
the local lakes?

781
01:05:01,763 --> 01:05:03,428
No. Why would they?

782
01:05:03,564 --> 01:05:05,684
The lakes were frozen over
when the boys went missing.

783
01:05:06,895 --> 01:05:09,934
Lake Maru is where
we take campers ice fishing,

784
01:05:10,069 --> 01:05:12,032
so we store our equipment there.

785
01:05:13,804 --> 01:05:16,104
Wild Bill used it
for the kids' hockey games.

786
01:05:16,239 --> 01:05:17,937
He was a good skater.

787
01:05:18,073 --> 01:05:20,109
That's the only lake
where he would have the tools

788
01:05:20,244 --> 01:05:23,076
to make a hole in the ice and...

789
01:05:23,211 --> 01:05:24,612
dump the bodies.

790
01:05:24,747 --> 01:05:29,151
Okay, so i-if we find Felix,
Cal and Spike,

791
01:05:29,286 --> 01:05:32,752
allow them to rest, as you say,

792
01:05:32,887 --> 01:05:35,656
that would get rid
of The Grabber's power?

793
01:05:37,226 --> 01:05:39,396
I think so. Yeah.

794
01:05:41,229 --> 01:05:42,797
Okay, then.

795
01:05:42,933 --> 01:05:47,701
At dawn, we head to Lake Maru
and look for those boys.

796
01:06:23,647 --> 01:06:25,937
Very funny, Mustang.

797
01:06:38,823 --> 01:06:42,961
Look what you made me do.

798
01:06:43,096 --> 01:06:46,434
You made me kill my brother.

799
01:06:52,503 --> 01:06:54,835
I know you're out there, Bill.

800
01:06:55,805 --> 01:06:58,376
You can't have those boys
forever.

801
01:06:59,940 --> 01:07:04,316
My name's not Bill.

802
01:07:05,513 --> 01:07:08,980
Wild Bill, Grabber.

803
01:07:09,989 --> 01:07:12,324
Evil is evil.

804
01:07:44,522 --> 01:07:47,594
I want

805
01:07:47,729 --> 01:07:52,067
to hurt you.

806
01:07:57,701 --> 01:08:00,202
We are gonna get
those boys back, Bill.

807
01:08:00,338 --> 01:08:03,302
My name's not Bill!

808
01:08:31,273 --> 01:08:33,773
The devil's lettuce
is not allowed

809
01:08:33,909 --> 01:08:36,441
in Camp Alpine property.

810
01:08:38,882 --> 01:08:40,845
So fire me.

811
01:08:49,152 --> 01:08:51,032
You've really been through it,
haven't you, kid?

812
01:08:58,801 --> 01:09:02,830
There's... there's a certain
look in a young man's eye.

813
01:09:04,005 --> 01:09:06,904
Kind of, um, quiet fury,

814
01:09:07,039 --> 01:09:08,606
kind of...

815
01:09:08,742 --> 01:09:12,477
deep rage when he's seen
too much or done too much.

816
01:09:18,614 --> 01:09:20,353
Get in many fights, Finn?

817
01:09:23,791 --> 01:09:24,924
So?

818
01:09:25,060 --> 01:09:27,591
So, here's what I know.

819
01:09:28,726 --> 01:09:32,530
Behind that kind of anger
is fear.

820
01:09:34,565 --> 01:09:35,928
I'm not afraid of anything.

821
01:09:36,064 --> 01:09:37,530
I know one thing
you're afraid of.

822
01:09:37,666 --> 01:09:40,032
Yeah? What's that?

823
01:09:40,167 --> 01:09:42,507
That you can't protect
your sister.

824
01:09:47,115 --> 01:09:49,574
When I was on the streets,

825
01:09:49,710 --> 01:09:51,647
I chose the wrong path.

826
01:09:51,783 --> 01:09:55,322
Instead of facing my fears,
I chose anger.

827
01:09:55,457 --> 01:09:57,258
You're doing the same.
I can see it.

828
01:09:59,495 --> 01:10:04,232
Finn, son...
this is what I do for a living.

829
01:10:04,367 --> 01:10:07,995
I meet half a dozen kids
like you every year.

830
01:10:08,130 --> 01:10:11,866
Kids who are told
this is who they have to be.

831
01:10:13,702 --> 01:10:16,838
You are stronger than you think.

832
01:10:18,381 --> 01:10:20,845
You were strong enough
to kill The Grabber,

833
01:10:20,980 --> 01:10:24,311
and you are strong enough to
let what happened with him go.

834
01:10:28,949 --> 01:10:31,017
I don't know how to do that.

835
01:10:32,059 --> 01:10:33,893
You got to...

836
01:10:34,029 --> 01:10:37,091
face your feelings.

837
01:10:37,226 --> 01:10:39,895
You can't just hold them in
and numb it all out.

838
01:10:40,030 --> 01:10:42,567
You got to face it,
and then you can let it go.

839
01:10:44,868 --> 01:10:48,034
He wants to kill Gwen,
to hurt me.

840
01:10:48,169 --> 01:10:50,938
Oh, we're not gonna
let that happen.

841
01:11:01,223 --> 01:11:03,422
I'm taking this with me.

842
01:11:03,558 --> 01:11:05,318
Come on, man. I need that.

843
01:11:05,453 --> 01:11:07,625
I'm doing you a favor.
This ain't even good shit.

844
01:11:08,860 --> 01:11:12,559
We head to the lake
in an hour, at sunup.

845
01:11:12,694 --> 01:11:14,929
Be ready.

846
01:12:15,929 --> 01:12:19,764
Me and Ernesto are gonna
take shifts watching you, so...

847
01:12:19,899 --> 01:12:22,601
if you have another nightmare,
we'll wake you.

848
01:12:24,238 --> 01:12:26,099
What if you can't?

849
01:12:28,108 --> 01:12:30,005
Then fight back.

850
01:12:30,975 --> 01:12:32,809
I mean, it's your dream,
isn't it?

851
01:12:34,447 --> 01:12:36,945
He makes it more than that.

852
01:12:41,788 --> 01:12:45,251
What about those books
you read about dreaming?

853
01:12:45,387 --> 01:12:47,659
You know, there's got to be
something you can try.

854
01:12:48,822 --> 01:12:50,926
He's too strong.

855
01:12:56,029 --> 01:12:58,197
I thought that once, too.

856
01:13:06,742 --> 01:13:08,205
She's out.

857
01:13:08,341 --> 01:13:09,912
Can I ask you a question?

858
01:13:15,154 --> 01:13:17,722
Did you really talk to my
brother down in that basement?

859
01:13:31,907 --> 01:13:33,434
Yeah.

860
01:13:33,569 --> 01:13:34,833
Yeah, I did.

861
01:13:34,968 --> 01:13:37,007
Wh-What'd he say?

862
01:13:37,143 --> 01:13:40,746
He said that your dad didn't
come back from Vietnam

863
01:13:40,882 --> 01:13:42,714
because he couldn't leave
his buddies behind.

864
01:13:44,345 --> 01:13:46,820
And that he wasn't gonna
leave me behind.

865
01:13:46,955 --> 01:13:48,555
Yeah?

866
01:13:49,691 --> 01:13:52,383
Yeah, that...
that was Robin all right.

867
01:13:55,859 --> 01:13:58,389
Do you think he's still here?

868
01:14:00,364 --> 01:14:04,764
I-I don't really know
what's on the other side,

869
01:14:04,900 --> 01:14:07,338
but there's something.

870
01:14:07,474 --> 01:14:09,301
And I hope it's good.

871
01:14:10,972 --> 01:14:12,771
And I hope he's there.

872
01:14:12,906 --> 01:14:15,439
But if he isn't,

873
01:14:15,574 --> 01:14:18,112
it's not me
he's here looking after.

874
01:14:21,718 --> 01:14:23,986
Wake me in four hours.

875
01:15:26,451 --> 01:15:28,281
Wild Bill.

876
01:15:54,646 --> 01:15:56,416
Nope, nope, no, no.

877
01:15:56,551 --> 01:15:58,916
Y-You're staying in bed tonight.

878
01:18:54,523 --> 01:18:56,588
You look like your mother.

879
01:19:00,161 --> 01:19:01,967
Why is she in here?

880
01:19:03,696 --> 01:19:06,266
A kindness, really.

881
01:19:06,401 --> 01:19:09,810
To you, I mean.
A kindness to you.

882
01:19:11,170 --> 01:19:12,472
A kindness?

883
01:19:14,080 --> 01:19:16,212
It's what I can manage.

884
01:19:19,217 --> 01:19:22,288
My mom dreamed about
Billy Showalter,

885
01:19:22,424 --> 01:19:24,153
the paperboy.

886
01:19:24,289 --> 01:19:26,585
He was the first kid taken
in our area.

887
01:19:28,228 --> 01:19:30,589
She figured out you took him,
didn't she?

888
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:35,231
Isn't that obvious?

889
01:19:37,197 --> 01:19:39,638
The kindness here

890
01:19:39,773 --> 01:19:42,608
is me showing you the truth

891
01:19:42,744 --> 01:19:45,608
before I do what I have to do.

892
01:20:00,495 --> 01:20:02,989
Abandon all hope,

893
01:20:03,124 --> 01:20:06,031
ye who enter here.

894
01:20:17,914 --> 01:20:20,947
She didn't kill herself.

895
01:20:24,144 --> 01:20:26,513
You killed her!

896
01:20:30,190 --> 01:20:32,424
No. No, no, no, no.

897
01:20:32,559 --> 01:20:34,017
No, no, no.

898
01:20:34,153 --> 01:20:35,286
No, no.

899
01:20:35,421 --> 01:20:36,762
No!

900
01:20:36,897 --> 01:20:39,929
What did you do?
What did you do?

901
01:20:40,065 --> 01:20:42,432
What have I done? What have...

902
01:20:42,568 --> 01:20:44,663
No, no!

903
01:20:44,798 --> 01:20:47,336
This is different than a dream.

904
01:20:48,204 --> 01:20:50,768
I conjured this from my hate

905
01:20:50,904 --> 01:20:54,275
and from whatever memories
hell let me keep.

906
01:20:54,410 --> 01:20:59,711
Hell is different
than you think.

907
01:20:59,846 --> 01:21:04,584
They take the best parts of you,
the human parts,

908
01:21:04,720 --> 01:21:09,761
and leave only the worst bits,
only the sins.

909
01:21:09,897 --> 01:21:15,226
I am a bottomless pit of sin.

910
01:21:17,306 --> 01:21:22,008
What do you think happens
when you die in this realm?

911
01:21:24,139 --> 01:21:25,671
I'd wake up.

912
01:21:26,414 --> 01:21:28,271
Maybe.

913
01:21:28,407 --> 01:21:30,878
Or perhaps...

914
01:21:31,014 --> 01:21:32,887
you just die.

915
01:21:36,285 --> 01:21:37,749
It's time to find out.

916
01:21:58,171 --> 01:21:59,407
Hello?

917
01:21:59,543 --> 01:22:00,831
You have to hide.

918
01:22:46,528 --> 01:22:47,656
Gwen! Gwen!

919
01:22:47,792 --> 01:22:48,792
Wake up!

920
01:22:48,925 --> 01:22:49,925
Gwen!

921
01:22:50,060 --> 01:22:51,497
Gwen, wake up!

922
01:22:51,633 --> 01:22:53,500
Finn! Mustang!

923
01:22:53,636 --> 01:22:54,835
Gwen.

924
01:22:54,971 --> 01:22:55,899
What's wrong with her?

925
01:22:56,035 --> 01:22:56,896
Gwen. Gwen!

926
01:23:11,514 --> 01:23:12,643
Gwen!

927
01:23:12,779 --> 01:23:14,150
Gwen!

928
01:23:14,285 --> 01:23:15,814
-Gwen, wake up!
-Gwen!

929
01:23:42,348 --> 01:23:43,528
-Gwen? Gwen, wake up.
-Gwen!

930
01:23:43,611 --> 01:23:44,885
-Gwen, wake up.
-Gwen!

931
01:23:45,021 --> 01:23:46,035
-Gwen, wake up.
-Gwen, wake up!

932
01:23:47,517 --> 01:23:48,837
Gwen, wake up!

933
01:23:48,948 --> 01:23:50,823
-Gwen, wake up!
-Gwen!

934
01:23:50,958 --> 01:23:52,318
Gwen, wake up!

935
01:23:53,753 --> 01:23:56,030
-Hey!
-Gwen!

936
01:24:05,340 --> 01:24:08,504
Ah, naughty girl, Gwen.

937
01:24:09,406 --> 01:24:11,538
Fuck you with a dinosaur dick.

938
01:24:11,674 --> 01:24:14,908
Oh, salty tongue
for a girl so young.

939
01:24:16,818 --> 01:24:18,680
What are you doing?

940
01:24:18,816 --> 01:24:20,600
If someone tries to take

941
01:24:20,683 --> 01:24:23,947
what power I do have
away from me,

942
01:24:24,082 --> 01:24:28,420
I have every right
to defend myself.

943
01:24:30,059 --> 01:24:31,230
Mando.

944
01:24:36,337 --> 01:24:38,200
Tell the boys I miss them.

945
01:24:45,041 --> 01:24:46,542
Mando!

946
01:24:59,422 --> 01:25:00,784
Gwen, wake up!

947
01:25:25,383 --> 01:25:26,916
-Gwen!
-Gwen!

948
01:25:41,564 --> 01:25:43,161
-Gwen!
-Keep pressure on it.

949
01:25:43,297 --> 01:25:44,499
Got it.

950
01:25:44,635 --> 01:25:46,272
All right,
help me flip her over.

951
01:25:47,070 --> 01:25:48,966
Gwen.

952
01:25:49,102 --> 01:25:51,574
Gwen, wake up. Gwen?

953
01:25:53,081 --> 01:25:54,574
-Gwen?
-Okay.

954
01:25:54,709 --> 01:25:56,277
Gwen, can you hear us?

955
01:25:56,413 --> 01:25:58,143
Gwen, wake up.

956
01:25:58,279 --> 01:25:59,568
-Gwen, wake up!
-Hey, keep pressure on the wound.

957
01:25:59,651 --> 01:26:00,963
-Got it.
-Gwen? Gwen, can you hear me?

958
01:26:01,046 --> 01:26:02,785
-Is she breathing?
-Gwen, come on.

959
01:26:02,921 --> 01:26:04,673
-You've got to wake up, Gwen.
-Come on. We need help.

960
01:26:04,756 --> 01:26:05,909
Gwen, Gwen, if you can hear me,
you have to fight back!

961
01:26:05,992 --> 01:26:08,118
Gwen, fight back!

962
01:26:28,809 --> 01:26:30,475
You didn't bring me here.

963
01:26:30,610 --> 01:26:32,176
I brought myself.

964
01:26:32,312 --> 01:26:36,355
I chose to come here,
and I can leave when I want.

965
01:26:37,683 --> 01:26:39,519
I understand now.

966
01:26:39,655 --> 01:26:42,356
In a dream, I have power, too.

967
01:26:42,492 --> 01:26:44,264
So?

968
01:26:47,331 --> 01:26:49,396
What are you doing?

969
01:26:49,531 --> 01:26:51,163
Isn't it obvious?

970
01:26:51,298 --> 01:26:54,397
I'm fighting back, you grievous,
festering ass wound.

971
01:26:59,146 --> 01:27:01,380
See you later, Wild Bill.

972
01:27:07,821 --> 01:27:09,154
Mando.

973
01:27:09,289 --> 01:27:11,720
Mando!

974
01:27:21,069 --> 01:27:22,599
Is he dead?

975
01:27:25,040 --> 01:27:27,538
I found... I found Felix.

976
01:27:28,538 --> 01:27:31,278
I found him. I found Felix.

977
01:27:42,416 --> 01:27:43,618
Mustang?

978
01:27:43,753 --> 01:27:45,291
-What time is it?
-About 4:30.

979
01:27:45,426 --> 01:27:46,892
What's happened?
Are you all right?

980
01:27:47,027 --> 01:27:48,394
Yeah, I'm fine.

981
01:27:48,529 --> 01:27:50,090
Mando fell through the ice
on Lake Maru.

982
01:27:50,226 --> 01:27:52,127
Oh, no.

983
01:27:52,263 --> 01:27:55,665
He's okay, but he found one of
the missing boys in the water.

984
01:27:57,069 --> 01:27:59,399
We're all gonna start looking
for the other two at dawn.

985
01:27:59,534 --> 01:28:00,604
We need your help.

986
01:28:01,772 --> 01:28:03,706
Not with that demon child
out there.

987
01:28:05,342 --> 01:28:06,808
Her name is Gwen,

988
01:28:06,943 --> 01:28:09,579
and she is the reason
we got to Mando in time.

989
01:28:09,715 --> 01:28:12,880
That demon child,
she saved his life.

990
01:28:13,016 --> 01:28:14,856
-I-I don't know, Mustang. We...
-You know what?

991
01:28:14,952 --> 01:28:16,832
You want to be all
yellow-bellied and barn-sour,

992
01:28:16,921 --> 01:28:18,601
lock yourself in this room
until it's safe,

993
01:28:18,719 --> 01:28:20,593
you go right ahead.

994
01:28:20,728 --> 01:28:23,330
But that ain't no kind
of true Christian behavior.

995
01:28:27,926 --> 01:28:29,534
Sun's up at 7:00.

996
01:28:53,787 --> 01:28:55,626
Gwen!

997
01:28:56,625 --> 01:28:58,492
There you are. You okay?

998
01:29:11,675 --> 01:29:13,978
Dad?

999
01:29:14,113 --> 01:29:15,310
Hey, kids.

1000
01:29:15,446 --> 01:29:16,713
What are you doing here?

1001
01:29:17,949 --> 01:29:20,647
Heard you were snowed in,
so I called in a favor.

1002
01:29:20,782 --> 01:29:22,213
Oh, thank God.

1003
01:29:22,349 --> 01:29:23,765
We can finally get you
the hell out of here.

1004
01:29:23,848 --> 01:29:26,225
We have to stay.

1005
01:29:26,360 --> 01:29:27,719
-What?
-What?

1006
01:29:27,855 --> 01:29:29,726
We have to stay.

1007
01:29:32,299 --> 01:29:33,495
Wh-What's going on?

1008
01:29:33,631 --> 01:29:35,199
Our work here isn't done.

1009
01:29:35,335 --> 01:29:37,895
He's after her, Dad.

1010
01:29:38,031 --> 01:29:40,539
He's... Who-who's "he?"

1011
01:29:41,634 --> 01:29:42,937
Him.

1012
01:29:48,074 --> 01:29:50,014
I don't know...

1013
01:29:50,149 --> 01:29:52,342
Gwen, um...

1014
01:29:53,952 --> 01:29:57,347
-Is this more dream stuff?
-Dad, don't.

1015
01:30:00,053 --> 01:30:01,693
Okay, we're getting out of here.

1016
01:30:01,828 --> 01:30:04,162
-Come on. Let's go.
-I'll get my stuff.

1017
01:30:04,298 --> 01:30:05,927
I'm not going anywhere.

1018
01:30:07,297 --> 01:30:08,325
Gwen.

1019
01:30:09,798 --> 01:30:11,171
He's going to kill you.

1020
01:30:11,306 --> 01:30:13,402
Okay, and I can't stop him.

1021
01:30:13,537 --> 01:30:14,902
But we have a chance.

1022
01:30:15,038 --> 01:30:16,627
A chance to protect you,
to keep you safe.

1023
01:30:16,710 --> 01:30:18,444
You're gonna take care
of me, Finn?

1024
01:30:18,579 --> 01:30:21,539
You can't even take care
of yourself.

1025
01:30:21,675 --> 01:30:24,141
You are just like fucking Dad,
putting your head in the sand

1026
01:30:24,277 --> 01:30:25,917
and numbing yourself
into oblivion.

1027
01:30:26,052 --> 01:30:27,277
Whoa.

1028
01:30:27,413 --> 01:30:28,870
Where did that come from?

1029
01:30:28,953 --> 01:30:30,175
You've seen
what he's been doing.

1030
01:30:30,258 --> 01:30:31,955
You're just ignoring it,

1031
01:30:32,091 --> 01:30:33,871
pretending you don't
smell it on him, in his room,

1032
01:30:33,954 --> 01:30:34,954
-in the backyard.
-Narc.

1033
01:30:35,087 --> 01:30:36,395
You can't narc about

1034
01:30:36,531 --> 01:30:38,126
what everyone already knows,
dingus.

1035
01:30:38,261 --> 01:30:40,399
You're just smoking your
fucking life away to pretend

1036
01:30:40,534 --> 01:30:41,462
-none of this happened.
-Shut up.

1037
01:30:41,598 --> 01:30:42,996
Well, it happened, Finn.

1038
01:30:43,132 --> 01:30:44,733
-Shut up.
-And it happened to those kids.

1039
01:30:44,869 --> 01:30:46,563
-Shut up.
-And it's happening now.

1040
01:30:46,699 --> 01:30:48,018
And you two just want to run
and hide like you always do.

1041
01:30:48,101 --> 01:30:49,332
-Shut up.
-Bottle, joint.

1042
01:30:49,468 --> 01:30:50,971
-Same fucking Friday night.
-Shut up!

1043
01:30:51,107 --> 01:30:52,910
-Anything to stop the pain.
-Shut up!

1044
01:30:53,046 --> 01:30:55,028
Anything to feel for a few hours
like what happened to you

1045
01:30:55,111 --> 01:30:57,079
down in that basement
wasn't real!

1046
01:30:57,215 --> 01:30:58,951
Shut up!

1047
01:30:59,086 --> 01:31:01,411
All right, you don't think
I don't know it was real?

1048
01:31:02,889 --> 01:31:05,723
You think I don't fucking know
it was real?

1049
01:31:07,956 --> 01:31:10,156
It's all I ever think about.

1050
01:31:11,365 --> 01:31:12,830
All right, you don't...

1051
01:31:12,965 --> 01:31:14,383
you don't know
what it was like down there.

1052
01:31:14,466 --> 01:31:16,063
Nobody fucking knows.

1053
01:31:19,438 --> 01:31:21,231
All right, I was...

1054
01:31:21,366 --> 01:31:24,742
I was so fucking scared.

1055
01:31:32,279 --> 01:31:35,181
God, I don't want to be
angry anymore.

1056
01:31:51,430 --> 01:31:54,068
I don't want to be
afraid anymore.

1057
01:31:58,573 --> 01:32:00,107
Hey.

1058
01:32:03,145 --> 01:32:05,552
You're the bravest person
I know.

1059
01:32:12,653 --> 01:32:14,056
Okay.

1060
01:32:14,192 --> 01:32:16,563
Gwen, look at me, please.
I know you want to stay.

1061
01:32:16,698 --> 01:32:19,562
I know, but if you really are
in danger here,

1062
01:32:19,697 --> 01:32:22,002
we need to leave right now.

1063
01:32:22,137 --> 01:32:24,495
No.

1064
01:32:24,631 --> 01:32:28,598
Sweetheart, I'm sorry,
but I'm not asking.

1065
01:32:28,733 --> 01:32:30,842
What are you gonna do, Dad?
You gonna beat me?

1066
01:32:30,977 --> 01:32:33,035
Take off your belt
and whip me into the truck?

1067
01:32:33,171 --> 01:32:34,238
Don't, don't...

1068
01:32:34,374 --> 01:32:36,540
Go ahead and try.
See if it works.

1069
01:32:36,676 --> 01:32:38,128
Your mother, right there.
There's your mother.

1070
01:32:38,211 --> 01:32:40,379
You're just like your mother.

1071
01:32:40,515 --> 01:32:43,223
Stubborn! You're so stubborn
right to the end,

1072
01:32:43,358 --> 01:32:45,058
even in the face of reality.

1073
01:32:45,193 --> 01:32:46,954
The end? The end?

1074
01:32:47,090 --> 01:32:49,024
Let me tell you
about the end, Dad.

1075
01:32:50,057 --> 01:32:52,258
Mom didn't kill herself.

1076
01:32:54,730 --> 01:32:56,097
Okay. That's it.

1077
01:32:56,232 --> 01:32:57,928
Let's all get
in the goddamn truck.

1078
01:32:58,064 --> 01:33:00,339
No, no, wait, Gwen.

1079
01:33:00,474 --> 01:33:02,268
What are you talking about?

1080
01:33:03,574 --> 01:33:05,372
Mom's dreams.

1081
01:33:05,507 --> 01:33:08,679
She was dreaming about
a missing kid, wasn't she?

1082
01:33:08,814 --> 01:33:10,881
Talking about camp
before she died.

1083
01:33:11,016 --> 01:33:12,304
That's why you remembered
the camp.

1084
01:33:12,387 --> 01:33:14,379
Yeah, but... Yeah, so? So?

1085
01:33:14,514 --> 01:33:17,557
She found him
long before he took Finn,

1086
01:33:17,693 --> 01:33:21,122
and he saw her,
and he came to our house.

1087
01:33:22,756 --> 01:33:23,927
No.

1088
01:33:25,595 --> 01:33:27,700
Holy shit.

1089
01:33:28,700 --> 01:33:31,464
He showed me that he killed her.

1090
01:33:31,600 --> 01:33:35,004
Dad, what was the first thing
you said when you saw Mom?

1091
01:33:36,539 --> 01:33:37,835
What?

1092
01:33:37,971 --> 01:33:39,744
You asked her,

1093
01:33:39,879 --> 01:33:42,808
"What did you do?
What did you do?"

1094
01:33:42,944 --> 01:33:45,345
And you blamed yourself.

1095
01:33:45,481 --> 01:33:48,919
You said, "What have I done?"

1096
01:33:51,090 --> 01:33:54,791
We were asleep when it happened,
when you found her.

1097
01:33:54,927 --> 01:33:56,960
How else could I know
what you said?

1098
01:33:58,093 --> 01:34:00,198
It wasn't your fault, Dad.

1099
01:34:00,333 --> 01:34:02,502
Oh, my God.

1100
01:34:02,637 --> 01:34:04,103
And it wasn't hers.

1101
01:34:04,238 --> 01:34:05,661
Oh, my God.

1102
01:34:05,797 --> 01:34:09,132
The man who took Finn
took her away from us

1103
01:34:09,268 --> 01:34:11,073
because she was onto him.

1104
01:34:13,474 --> 01:34:15,946
Because her dreams
weren't just dreams.

1105
01:34:19,244 --> 01:34:21,083
And neither are mine.

1106
01:34:35,330 --> 01:34:37,627
All right, pass me the cable.

1107
01:34:48,616 --> 01:34:50,684
<i>Hey, Jesus.</i>

1108
01:34:51,717 --> 01:34:53,687
<i>I'm not doing so well.</i>

1109
01:34:54,520 --> 01:34:56,080
<i>I need help.</i>

1110
01:34:56,216 --> 01:34:57,988
<i>Some real fucking help.</i>

1111
01:34:59,685 --> 01:35:02,086
<i>We got to find
those other two boys</i>

1112
01:35:02,222 --> 01:35:04,564
<i>to take away his power.</i>

1113
01:35:04,699 --> 01:35:07,030
<i>I'm scared he's gonna kill me.</i>

1114
01:35:08,030 --> 01:35:10,130
<i>For real this time.</i>

1115
01:35:10,265 --> 01:35:12,471
<i>Please don't let that happen.</i>

1116
01:35:12,607 --> 01:35:13,905
<i>Get us out of here alive.</i>

1117
01:35:15,510 --> 01:35:17,469
<i>Don't let him win.</i>

1118
01:35:20,109 --> 01:35:21,539
We're pretty much out of light.

1119
01:35:22,851 --> 01:35:25,550
Maybe Spike and Cal
are down too deep.

1120
01:35:25,686 --> 01:35:27,180
I was thinking the same thing.

1121
01:35:27,315 --> 01:35:28,821
We should've seen 'em by now.

1122
01:35:48,342 --> 01:35:50,268
Hey, whoa, girl.

1123
01:35:50,403 --> 01:35:52,240
You've done enough for today.

1124
01:36:06,025 --> 01:36:07,618
Oh, no, Gwen.

1125
01:36:08,724 --> 01:36:10,262
Gwen!

1126
01:36:10,398 --> 01:36:12,022
Gwen, wake up.

1127
01:36:12,157 --> 01:36:13,426
Need some help!

1128
01:36:24,169 --> 01:36:25,574
Hey, Gwen.

1129
01:36:25,710 --> 01:36:27,040
Gwen, wake up.

1130
01:36:27,175 --> 01:36:29,745
Sh-She accidentally fell asleep.

1131
01:36:29,880 --> 01:36:31,580
Accidentally, my ass.

1132
01:37:17,894 --> 01:37:19,657
He's here.

1133
01:37:55,167 --> 01:37:57,761
Oh, my God. Ken, Barbara!

1134
01:38:06,641 --> 01:38:09,012
He's still here. Keep looking.

1135
01:38:09,148 --> 01:38:11,882
Where is he? Where did he go?

1136
01:38:12,017 --> 01:38:13,678
The ice is breaking!

1137
01:38:16,985 --> 01:38:18,584
The cable!

1138
01:38:38,071 --> 01:38:39,946
Finn!

1139
01:38:43,551 --> 01:38:45,545
Whoa!

1140
01:38:46,545 --> 01:38:48,418
How the tables have turned.

1141
01:38:53,025 --> 01:38:56,457
Ernesto, get her out of here.

1142
01:39:06,601 --> 01:39:08,337
I remember the feeling.

1143
01:39:09,369 --> 01:39:11,604
Breathless, scared,

1144
01:39:11,740 --> 01:39:14,610
the whole of the world
starting to fade away.

1145
01:39:14,746 --> 01:39:16,596
I've got Gwen.
Watch out. I'm coming through.

1146
01:39:16,679 --> 01:39:18,545
-You all right?
-Here. Here.

1147
01:39:25,786 --> 01:39:28,093
-You got him?
-Yeah. I got him.

1148
01:39:59,486 --> 01:40:03,652
"O grave, where is thy victory?

1149
01:40:03,788 --> 01:40:07,000
O death, where is thy sting?"

1150
01:40:11,631 --> 01:40:14,073
Scripture?

1151
01:40:15,973 --> 01:40:18,038
God's not here.

1152
01:40:18,173 --> 01:40:19,639
You're alone.

1153
01:40:21,647 --> 01:40:22,977
No.

1154
01:40:23,112 --> 01:40:24,644
I brought friends.

1155
01:41:18,872 --> 01:41:21,168
The boys are found.

1156
01:41:21,303 --> 01:41:22,742
You're powerless.

1157
01:41:50,234 --> 01:41:52,435
Oh, you're so fucked.

1158
01:41:53,468 --> 01:41:55,673
Hell isn't flames, Bill.

1159
01:41:55,809 --> 01:41:57,434
It's ice.

1160
01:42:07,251 --> 01:42:09,012
You don't scare me.

1161
01:43:28,526 --> 01:43:30,031
Hey.

1162
01:43:30,166 --> 01:43:31,864
You okay?

1163
01:43:46,846 --> 01:43:48,485
You did good, Dad.

1164
01:43:53,127 --> 01:43:54,452
It's over.

1165
01:43:54,587 --> 01:43:56,556
He's gone.

1166
01:43:56,691 --> 01:43:58,430
Where'd he go?

1167
01:43:58,565 --> 01:44:01,300
The boys took him back
to where he belongs.

1168
01:44:12,403 --> 01:44:15,611
Hi. This is Armando Reyes
from Alpine Lake.

1169
01:44:18,246 --> 01:44:19,411
Yeah.

1170
01:44:19,546 --> 01:44:20,811
Good, good. Yeah.

1171
01:44:20,947 --> 01:44:23,256
I know it's-it's been a minute.

1172
01:44:24,224 --> 01:44:27,058
The reason why I'm calling is

1173
01:44:27,194 --> 01:44:29,592
I have some news about Calvin.

1174
01:44:31,259 --> 01:44:32,760
Yes.

1175
01:44:34,761 --> 01:44:37,699
Yeah, we finally found him.

1176
01:44:47,407 --> 01:44:49,205
What?

1177
01:44:50,348 --> 01:44:52,208
You can't hear that?

1178
01:44:53,418 --> 01:44:55,414
-Uh-uh.
-The phone is ringing.

1179
01:45:00,093 --> 01:45:01,684
Must be for you, then.

1180
01:45:21,973 --> 01:45:24,315
Hello?

1181
01:45:24,450 --> 01:45:26,345
Hi, sweetie.

1182
01:45:31,258 --> 01:45:34,184
-Mom?
-Mm-hmm. Yeah, baby.

1183
01:45:34,319 --> 01:45:36,989
I don't have much time,
but it's me.

1184
01:45:40,935 --> 01:45:43,296
Where are you?

1185
01:45:43,431 --> 01:45:45,036
You know where.

1186
01:45:45,172 --> 01:45:46,803
It's beautiful here.

1187
01:45:49,306 --> 01:45:51,635
-It is?
-Mm.

1188
01:45:51,771 --> 01:45:54,171
Yeah, so beautiful.

1189
01:45:55,345 --> 01:45:56,782
Just like you.

1190
01:46:00,813 --> 01:46:03,517
I... I miss you, Mom.

1191
01:46:03,653 --> 01:46:06,986
Oh. I miss you, too, sweetie.

1192
01:46:08,359 --> 01:46:10,259
But you did so well.

1193
01:46:10,394 --> 01:46:12,530
You saved those boys.

1194
01:46:14,733 --> 01:46:17,832
-I didn't save anyone.
-Yes, you did.

1195
01:46:18,698 --> 01:46:20,065
You set them free.

1196
01:46:20,200 --> 01:46:22,507
They're here
where they belong now.

1197
01:46:23,503 --> 01:46:25,110
Wait.

1198
01:46:25,245 --> 01:46:27,413
I have to ask you something.

1199
01:46:28,542 --> 01:46:30,746
Ask me anything.

1200
01:46:36,455 --> 01:46:39,392
Will I always be this cursed?

1201
01:46:40,960 --> 01:46:42,428
Oh.

1202
01:46:43,725 --> 01:46:45,992
It's not a curse, baby.

1203
01:46:47,332 --> 01:46:49,567
It was never a curse.

1204
01:46:52,798 --> 01:46:54,737
I have to go.

1205
01:46:55,671 --> 01:46:59,036
Tell your brother I love him

1206
01:46:59,171 --> 01:47:02,371
and that Robin says hi.

1207
01:48:09,745 --> 01:48:10,978
Kids!

1208
01:48:12,019 --> 01:48:13,314
Time to go.

1209
01:48:13,450 --> 01:48:14,949
Get a move on.

1210
01:48:26,261 --> 01:48:28,791
So, what do you think
of that Ernesto boy?

1211
01:48:30,164 --> 01:48:32,329
She could do a lot worse.

1212
01:48:32,465 --> 01:48:34,465
-How about you?
-No, Dad...

1213
01:48:34,601 --> 01:48:36,681
That Mustang girl
seemed pretty cute to me.

1214
01:48:36,809 --> 01:48:39,776
Ah. Dad, please just...
just drive.

1215
01:48:40,909 --> 01:48:43,007
Just saying.

1216
01:48:43,142 --> 01:48:44,847
Eyes on the road.

1217
01:48:44,982 --> 01:48:47,216
