1
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:33,535
Alright, who else?

2
00:00:33,868 --> 00:00:36,571
Uh, we need
to have the Wilsons.

3
00:00:36,771 --> 00:00:38,205
Oh, shit!

4
00:00:38,372 --> 00:00:41,709
-We can't forget the Wilsons.
-The Wilsons.

5
00:00:43,011 --> 00:00:44,211
Anyone else?

6
00:00:44,378 --> 00:00:46,246
Uh... Thank you.

7
00:00:46,446 --> 00:00:47,882
Um, nope.

8
00:00:48,048 --> 00:00:49,416
I think that is it.

9
00:00:49,617 --> 00:00:50,852
Alrighty, then.

10
00:00:52,119 --> 00:00:53,186
Shall we?

11
00:00:53,353 --> 00:00:54,254
Clear?

12
00:00:55,389 --> 00:00:56,724
All clear.

13
00:00:58,225 --> 00:00:59,694
Uh-oh.

14
00:00:59,861 --> 00:01:01,261
-No.
-Close call.

15
00:01:05,633 --> 00:01:07,167
Let's roll.

16
00:01:08,736 --> 00:01:10,203
<i>Hey,this is Mitch.</i>

17
00:01:10,237 --> 00:01:11,673
<i>Please leave a message</i>
<i>and I'll get right back to you.</i>

18
00:01:15,009 --> 00:01:17,545
<i>Please, tell me you're okay.</i>

19
00:01:17,579 --> 00:01:19,479
<i>I've been trying the resort,</i>
<i>but no-one's answering.</i>

20
00:01:19,514 --> 00:01:21,415
<i>They're saying</i>
<i>on the news that...</i>

21
00:01:21,583 --> 00:01:23,216
<i>I'm so scared.</i>

22
00:01:23,483 --> 00:01:24,852
<i>I need you.</i>

23
00:01:25,053 --> 00:01:26,386
<i>I love you.</i>

24
00:01:26,654 --> 00:01:27,689
<i>I'll keep trying.</i>

25
00:01:28,823 --> 00:01:30,190
<i>I'll keep trying.</i>

26
00:01:59,687 --> 00:02:01,623
<i>Tragic</i>
<i>images continue to emerge</i>

27
00:02:01,889 --> 00:02:04,358
<i>following the US Military's</i>
<i>accidental deployment</i>

28
00:02:04,626 --> 00:02:06,360
<i>of an experimental weapon</i>

29
00:02:06,628 --> 00:02:08,462
<i>off the coast</i>
<i>of Tasmania last week,</i>

30
00:02:08,730 --> 00:02:11,032
<i>which resulted</i>
<i>in the decimation of Hobart</i>

31
00:02:11,298 --> 00:02:14,636
<i>and a total loss of life</i>
<i>across the island.</i>

32
00:02:14,902 --> 00:02:17,270
<i>Protests in Washington, D.C.,</i>
<i>have escalated</i>

33
00:02:17,538 --> 00:02:20,207
<i>as pressure from the UN and</i>
<i>the Australian Prime Minister</i>

34
00:02:20,474 --> 00:02:22,476
<i>to hold the US President</i>
<i>to account</i>

35
00:02:22,744 --> 00:02:24,478
<i>has reached fever pitch.</i>

36
00:02:24,746 --> 00:02:26,514
<i>Just why news reporters can't</i>
<i>go into disaster zones...</i>

37
00:02:38,092 --> 00:02:39,861
I wasn't snoring, was I?

38
00:02:41,562 --> 00:02:42,864
Not a peep.

39
00:02:48,603 --> 00:02:51,806
You know, apparently
they didn't feel a thing,

40
00:02:51,973 --> 00:02:55,308
just kind of
drifted off to sleep.

41
00:02:56,343 --> 00:03:01,314
Hopefully, he's one of
the lucky ones that wakes up.

42
00:03:04,519 --> 00:03:06,386
<i>...has started to take shape.</i>

43
00:03:06,654 --> 00:03:08,690
<i>Stretching beyond the fireball</i>
<i>at the centre of the blast,</i>

44
00:03:08,956 --> 00:03:10,558
<i>an electromagnetic pulse</i>

45
00:03:10,825 --> 00:03:12,894
<i>resulted in the catastrophic</i>
<i>neural failure</i>

46
00:03:13,161 --> 00:03:14,696
<i>of all living things</i>
<i>on the island,</i>

47
00:03:14,962 --> 00:03:16,864
<i>causing their death.</i>

48
00:03:17,197 --> 00:03:19,734
<i>We urgently need volunteers</i>
<i>to come to Tasmania</i>

49
00:03:20,001 --> 00:03:22,670
<i>and assist in the aftermath</i>
<i>of this disaster.</i>

50
00:03:22,704 --> 00:03:25,773
<i>This is a task of</i>
<i>unprecedented scale.</i>

51
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:29,276
<i>The nation calls upon you</i>
<i>to stand up</i>

52
00:03:29,544 --> 00:03:32,080
<i>and to show</i>
<i>the resilient spirit...</i>

53
00:03:35,049 --> 00:03:37,185
Our nation thanks you
for volunteering your services

54
00:03:37,384 --> 00:03:38,886
during this dark time.

55
00:03:39,053 --> 00:03:40,353
Please, place
your phone in the tub

56
00:03:40,521 --> 00:03:43,558
and make your way over to
the hangar for registration.

57
00:03:43,725 --> 00:03:44,859
Your phones
will be returned to you

58
00:03:45,026 --> 00:03:46,359
upon departing the island.

59
00:03:46,527 --> 00:03:47,995
Thank you!

60
00:03:48,162 --> 00:03:50,263
Welcome to Devonport!

61
00:03:50,464 --> 00:03:52,033
Our nation thanks you...

62
00:04:10,585 --> 00:04:12,419
Next! Nice and quick.

63
00:04:12,587 --> 00:04:14,088
Over there, please.

64
00:04:14,321 --> 00:04:16,423
Is this information correct?
Is that you?

65
00:04:16,591 --> 00:04:19,060
Go grab your kit...

66
00:04:19,227 --> 00:04:21,696
- Next!
- I wanna see my fuckin' wife!

67
00:04:21,863 --> 00:04:23,131
- We get it!
- Next!

68
00:04:24,565 --> 00:04:27,969
Miss? ID. Hat off.

69
00:04:29,203 --> 00:04:31,072
I'm here on a compassionate
grounds exemption.

70
00:04:31,105 --> 00:04:32,807
I'd like to join
the body retrieval unit

71
00:04:33,007 --> 00:04:34,407
down in the south
of the island.

72
00:04:34,709 --> 00:04:36,911
I need to get to a small town
down there called Woodbridge.

73
00:04:37,078 --> 00:04:38,212
No-one's going
south of Hobart yet.

74
00:04:38,378 --> 00:04:39,747
Sorry?

75
00:04:39,914 --> 00:04:41,481
The whole city's
still burning.

76
00:04:41,682 --> 00:04:43,618
You're gonna have to sit tight
till the fires are out.

77
00:04:43,785 --> 00:04:45,285
Look, stick with your unit.

78
00:04:45,452 --> 00:04:47,287
You'll make it south
eventually.

79
00:04:50,892 --> 00:04:52,894
Who was down there?

80
00:04:54,028 --> 00:04:55,797
My husband.

81
00:04:57,632 --> 00:04:59,100
I'm sorry.

82
00:04:59,267 --> 00:05:01,002
It's just how it is.

83
00:05:02,103 --> 00:05:03,771
Go grab your kit.

84
00:05:03,938 --> 00:05:05,740
You'll be moving out soon
with Unit 209 just over there.

85
00:05:05,907 --> 00:05:06,941
-Next, please!
-Listen.

86
00:05:07,108 --> 00:05:08,475
I'm a physical therapist.

87
00:05:08,643 --> 00:05:10,144
Maybe I could help out
with things while I wait.

88
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:11,311
Your exemption was for

89
00:05:11,478 --> 00:05:12,680
disaster victim
identification,

90
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:14,148
body retrieval.

91
00:05:14,314 --> 00:05:15,583
That's what you're doing
while you're

92
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:16,984
on the island
or you're heading home.

93
00:05:17,084 --> 00:05:18,953
Is it true
what they're saying?

94
00:05:21,255 --> 00:05:23,024
I'm sure
you've all heard the rumours

95
00:05:23,224 --> 00:05:26,694
and I can confirm...
they're true.

96
00:05:26,727 --> 00:05:28,596
In rare circumstances,
we're observing

97
00:05:28,763 --> 00:05:30,698
unusual behaviour
from some of the deceased.

98
00:05:30,898 --> 00:05:32,533
Now, we have no way of knowing

99
00:05:32,767 --> 00:05:34,702
when a victim
may come back online.

100
00:05:34,735 --> 00:05:36,103
But take it from me -

101
00:05:36,270 --> 00:05:38,338
the lights are on,
no-one's home.

102
00:05:38,573 --> 00:05:40,308
Listen! Listen!

103
00:05:42,342 --> 00:05:44,377
If you happen
to come across a victim

104
00:05:44,579 --> 00:05:46,681
who's showing signs
of activity,

105
00:05:46,848 --> 00:05:49,183
the military will be there
to take care of them,

106
00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:52,053
efficiently,
with the dignity they deserve.

107
00:05:55,690 --> 00:05:57,992
The odd ones
that do come back online,

108
00:05:58,159 --> 00:06:01,963
I can assure you they
are docile, slow moving.

109
00:06:02,129 --> 00:06:04,198
You have nothing to fear.

110
00:06:04,364 --> 00:06:08,069
So just stay calm
and let us do our job.

111
00:06:50,511 --> 00:06:53,114
Hey, mate?
Hey, mate? Can I just...

112
00:06:54,414 --> 00:06:56,217
How many of them
have actually come back?

113
00:06:57,518 --> 00:06:59,253
Look.

114
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:02,223
If you come across one,
pop your flare,

115
00:07:02,390 --> 00:07:04,125
me and the boys
will come in, sort it out.

116
00:07:05,593 --> 00:07:07,595
Hey, you'll be alright.

117
00:07:09,030 --> 00:07:10,598
Why only some of them?

118
00:07:10,765 --> 00:07:12,867
It's gonna be okay.

119
00:07:48,903 --> 00:07:51,505
Two to a house!
Partner up. Let's move!

120
00:07:51,706 --> 00:07:55,176
Thank you. I want to see
a sense of urgency, people!

121
00:07:56,777 --> 00:07:58,446
Move!

122
00:08:16,831 --> 00:08:18,132
Over here!

123
00:08:24,939 --> 00:08:26,807
You know, it was hard
saying goodbye to them, but...

124
00:08:28,442 --> 00:08:30,978
I felt like I had
to pitch in down here.

125
00:08:31,078 --> 00:08:32,847
What about you? Got kids?

126
00:08:37,618 --> 00:08:39,020
No.

127
00:08:56,170 --> 00:08:57,471
I'll check upstairs!

128
00:10:24,225 --> 00:10:25,926
Hey, are you okay?

129
00:10:27,795 --> 00:10:29,163
Uh, I need to, um...

130
00:10:29,196 --> 00:10:31,832
I need to go.

131
00:10:32,032 --> 00:10:33,568
I need to hug my girls.

132
00:10:36,137 --> 00:10:37,972
Okay.

133
00:10:57,992 --> 00:10:59,793
Sorry, mate.

134
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:01,662
I'm fuckin' done.

135
00:11:05,232 --> 00:11:07,101
You're gonna need
to find someone else.

136
00:11:26,487 --> 00:11:28,989
Anyone home?
Are you there? Oi!

137
00:11:32,259 --> 00:11:34,028
I don't get it.

138
00:11:34,195 --> 00:11:36,897
Why do only some of them
come back, not all of them?

139
00:11:37,097 --> 00:11:39,534
Fucked if I know.
Poor bastards.

140
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:40,901
Imagine having to die twice.

141
00:11:41,101 --> 00:11:43,204
Fuck that.

142
00:11:46,473 --> 00:11:47,908
Are you just gonna
fuckin' stand there or what?

143
00:11:48,108 --> 00:11:49,743
Fuck.

144
00:11:49,944 --> 00:11:52,681
Oh, doesn't
the smell bother you?

145
00:11:52,846 --> 00:11:54,882
-Of course it does.
-Where's your mask?

146
00:11:57,151 --> 00:11:58,752
How's that thing
working out for ya?

147
00:11:58,919 --> 00:12:01,222
Is it fuckin' cherry-flavoured
or something? Up!

148
00:13:24,138 --> 00:13:26,675
Great. Fucking great!

149
00:13:29,476 --> 00:13:30,944
-Where are you going?
-To shit.

150
00:13:31,111 --> 00:13:32,813
-Is that okay with you?
-Now?

151
00:13:34,783 --> 00:13:36,618
I don't know. Find some
fucking rope or something.

152
00:13:36,785 --> 00:13:37,985
Horsepower's the only way
we're getting

153
00:13:38,152 --> 00:13:39,820
her fat fucking arse
out of here.

154
00:13:56,170 --> 00:13:58,640
With this ring, I...

155
00:13:58,807 --> 00:14:00,174
If I can get it on.

156
00:14:00,341 --> 00:14:05,647
Uh, I bind my life
to yours... forever.

157
00:14:13,087 --> 00:14:14,622
Do you know there was
a chicken called Miracle Mike

158
00:14:14,789 --> 00:14:16,023
who went on living
for 18 months

159
00:14:16,190 --> 00:14:17,458
after they chopped
its head off?

160
00:14:17,625 --> 00:14:19,193
- Oh, get fucked.
- Nah, it's true.

161
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:20,861
The farmer who tried
killing it aimed too high

162
00:14:21,028 --> 00:14:23,063
and left, like, a little bit
of its brain intact

163
00:14:23,263 --> 00:14:25,199
'cause, you know, birds have
these, like, big eye sockets

164
00:14:25,366 --> 00:14:26,701
so the brain
can't fit in the skull

165
00:14:26,867 --> 00:14:28,703
so part of it gets
squished into its neck.

166
00:14:28,869 --> 00:14:30,705
Headless chooks...
What are you talkin' about?

167
00:14:30,871 --> 00:14:32,841
Well, don't you reckon
they could learn so much

168
00:14:33,006 --> 00:14:34,475
about, like,
neural pathways and all that

169
00:14:34,642 --> 00:14:36,343
if they studied
one of the ones coming back,

170
00:14:36,511 --> 00:14:38,011
instead of just
blowing their heads off?

171
00:14:38,178 --> 00:14:39,980
I'll give you the hot tip,
alright?

172
00:14:40,147 --> 00:14:41,915
You can think about this, that
and a third, all you want -

173
00:14:42,116 --> 00:14:44,652
but while we're here,
we stick together.

174
00:14:44,819 --> 00:14:46,186
- He's gonna wake up!
- You get me?

175
00:14:46,353 --> 00:14:48,889
He is! I know he is!
He's gonna wake up!

176
00:14:49,056 --> 00:14:50,725
He's gonna wake up... No!

177
00:14:50,891 --> 00:14:52,326
Wake up! Wake up!

178
00:14:52,493 --> 00:14:53,728
Come on.

179
00:14:53,894 --> 00:14:55,262
No!

180
00:14:56,397 --> 00:14:59,834
Wake up. Oh, my boy!

181
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,503
My boy...

182
00:15:25,025 --> 00:15:26,528
What?
So like a masseuse?

183
00:15:26,694 --> 00:15:28,696
No, not like a masseuse.
Like a physical therapist.

184
00:15:28,863 --> 00:15:30,364
So you don't do massage?

185
00:15:30,532 --> 00:15:32,266
Uh, there's massage involved.

186
00:15:32,433 --> 00:15:33,735
My shoulder's been killing me

187
00:15:33,902 --> 00:15:35,737
since we started lifting
all these dead fucks.

188
00:15:35,904 --> 00:15:37,271
You reckon you can
take a look?

189
00:15:37,438 --> 00:15:39,741
-Uh, maybe.
-Awesome!

190
00:15:39,908 --> 00:15:42,276
-Thanks, Ava.
-I said maybe.

191
00:16:18,947 --> 00:16:20,915
It'll happen.

192
00:16:21,081 --> 00:16:22,784
I promise.

193
00:16:22,951 --> 00:16:25,018
We have all the time
in the world.

194
00:16:28,388 --> 00:16:29,757
- Hey! Here!
- Oi, hurry up!

195
00:16:29,924 --> 00:16:31,158
-Hurry up!
-He's in there! He's in there!

196
00:16:31,325 --> 00:16:32,292
Go, go, go!

197
00:16:32,459 --> 00:16:33,962
Fuck this!

198
00:16:34,127 --> 00:16:35,996
Oh, don't fucking help!

199
00:16:36,163 --> 00:16:37,799
Oh!

200
00:16:55,115 --> 00:16:58,018
Hey, GTS Monaro. Fuck me!

201
00:16:59,621 --> 00:17:01,388
Someone looked after you.

202
00:17:17,939 --> 00:17:19,541
Clay.

203
00:17:37,792 --> 00:17:38,760
Righto.

204
00:17:55,409 --> 00:17:56,443
Oi!

205
00:18:01,348 --> 00:18:03,051
They're coming.

206
00:18:22,402 --> 00:18:26,106
Go forth on your journey
from this world,

207
00:18:26,273 --> 00:18:29,644
in the name of the Father,
the Son and the Holy Spirit.

208
00:18:29,844 --> 00:18:31,244
Amen.

209
00:19:15,155 --> 00:19:16,490
Come on!

210
00:19:21,294 --> 00:19:22,797
Let's go!

211
00:20:07,942 --> 00:20:09,644
Fuck.

212
00:20:35,002 --> 00:20:36,504
Keep it down, you lot!

213
00:20:36,671 --> 00:20:38,573
Some of us
are trying to sleep!

214
00:20:38,740 --> 00:20:40,174
Fuck you!

215
00:21:05,833 --> 00:21:06,968
Going somewhere?

216
00:21:10,671 --> 00:21:12,974
I was just getting some air.

217
00:21:14,675 --> 00:21:15,977
That's what
the courtyard's for.

218
00:21:26,419 --> 00:21:28,990
Surprised we let any Yanks
chip in at all.

219
00:21:30,725 --> 00:21:32,794
Ask me,
should've been a blanket ban.

220
00:21:39,399 --> 00:21:41,301
Go blow off some steam
with that lot.

221
00:22:03,124 --> 00:22:05,325
Four, three, two, one!

222
00:22:32,485 --> 00:22:34,322
Well, Ava,

223
00:22:34,487 --> 00:22:36,324
here's to all the Lady
Mc-fucking-lard-arses

224
00:22:36,489 --> 00:22:38,893
and their narrow
fucking hallways.

225
00:22:39,093 --> 00:22:40,561
Who knows what beautiful
sights and smells

226
00:22:40,761 --> 00:22:41,796
awaits us tomorrow?

227
00:22:54,942 --> 00:22:56,577
So what's so special
in Hobart, then?

228
00:23:03,684 --> 00:23:05,319
My husband.

229
00:23:07,788 --> 00:23:09,223
Ugh.

230
00:23:09,389 --> 00:23:11,092
He was at a work retreat
just south of there

231
00:23:11,292 --> 00:23:13,327
at a town on the coast
called Woodbridge.

232
00:23:25,506 --> 00:23:27,174
The man in the garage today,

233
00:23:27,341 --> 00:23:30,211
he seemed like
he wasn't fully gone,

234
00:23:30,378 --> 00:23:31,779
like a part of him
was still there,

235
00:23:31,979 --> 00:23:33,881
like he was lost, scared.

236
00:23:34,048 --> 00:23:35,683
I saw a guy covered
in fuckin' motor oil

237
00:23:35,850 --> 00:23:37,218
who just came back
from the dead.

238
00:23:37,385 --> 00:23:39,220
Didn't spend too long
gazing into his eyes.

239
00:23:39,387 --> 00:23:41,756
He looked at me, right at me.

240
00:23:41,923 --> 00:23:44,125
He seemed more
than just nerve endings,

241
00:23:44,325 --> 00:23:46,227
more than just
a chicken without its head.

242
00:23:46,394 --> 00:23:48,029
-If Mitch is like that...
-Then what?

243
00:24:03,411 --> 00:24:04,745
Goodnight, Clay.

244
00:24:09,083 --> 00:24:10,418
Till tomorrow, partner!

245
00:25:22,656 --> 00:25:25,159
Holy fucking shit!

246
00:25:26,293 --> 00:25:28,362
What a fucking beauty!

247
00:25:28,529 --> 00:25:30,131
I gotta figure out
how to get this bad boy

248
00:25:30,297 --> 00:25:32,366
past the higher-ups.

249
00:25:32,533 --> 00:25:35,236
Give my fuckin' left nut
to take her for a spin, hey?

250
00:25:36,837 --> 00:25:38,039
What do you reckon
they'd throw at me?

251
00:25:39,508 --> 00:25:41,242
Talking months or years?

252
00:25:42,877 --> 00:25:44,245
Anyway...

253
00:25:45,846 --> 00:25:47,248
...good chat.

254
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:53,254
Jesus Christ.

255
00:25:55,189 --> 00:25:58,025
Fuck me dead!

256
00:25:58,192 --> 00:25:59,860
Some way to end
a fuckin' buck's.

257
00:26:03,964 --> 00:26:05,266
Check out the groom-to-be.

258
00:26:09,136 --> 00:26:10,704
Best day ever.

259
00:26:12,373 --> 00:26:14,742
What goes
on tour, right? Yoink!

260
00:26:15,910 --> 00:26:18,179
Oh.

261
00:26:18,345 --> 00:26:19,613
Do you fancy a bump?

262
00:26:19,814 --> 00:26:22,116
A little early for me.

263
00:26:23,184 --> 00:26:24,285
Hmph.

264
00:26:26,020 --> 00:26:27,556
So you ride, huh?

265
00:26:28,756 --> 00:26:31,560
Been dicking around on
dirt bikes since I was a kid.

266
00:26:32,827 --> 00:26:34,295
Never got the chance on
something like that, though.

267
00:26:35,496 --> 00:26:37,031
On something like that,

268
00:26:37,198 --> 00:26:38,799
there might be a way
around the worst of it.

269
00:26:38,999 --> 00:26:40,101
The worst of what?

270
00:26:41,503 --> 00:26:43,204
The roads,
the smoke, the army.

271
00:26:43,370 --> 00:26:44,805
The main arteries
will be a mess,

272
00:26:45,005 --> 00:26:46,607
but once we get
to Mount Wellington,

273
00:26:46,774 --> 00:26:48,609
it looks like there are some
narrow roads we could take.

274
00:26:48,776 --> 00:26:50,478
If we stick to the suburbs
that are already cleared

275
00:26:50,678 --> 00:26:52,046
there should be a way
to get to the highway

276
00:26:52,213 --> 00:26:53,582
without them spotting us.

277
00:26:53,747 --> 00:26:56,650
We're... we're 200 miles
from the Enso Resort.

278
00:26:56,851 --> 00:26:58,252
Leave now, get a good
enough run, who knows?

279
00:26:58,419 --> 00:26:59,887
Could be there later today.

280
00:27:00,054 --> 00:27:01,822
You'd get to take her
for one hell of a spin

281
00:27:02,022 --> 00:27:03,558
and wouldn't even have
to give up your left nut.

282
00:27:03,724 --> 00:27:05,459
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Just wait up, Ava.

283
00:27:05,626 --> 00:27:07,294
You might've signed up
to this to find your hubby,

284
00:27:07,461 --> 00:27:08,896
but I want to make
a difference.

285
00:27:09,063 --> 00:27:10,431
My country needs me.

286
00:27:10,599 --> 00:27:12,066
The dead need me.

287
00:27:14,536 --> 00:27:16,971
I'm just
fucking with you.

288
00:27:17,138 --> 00:27:20,174
-Mmm, I'll find some helmets.
-Really?

289
00:27:20,374 --> 00:27:21,909
Yeah, we'll need
a full tank too.

290
00:27:22,076 --> 00:27:24,979
Whoo! Alright,
let's fucking roll.

291
00:28:05,085 --> 00:28:06,387
Can you hear?

292
00:28:12,426 --> 00:28:14,128
Ava! What are you doing?

293
00:28:14,295 --> 00:28:15,664
Get the fuck away from it!

294
00:29:02,476 --> 00:29:03,844
Whoo!

295
00:29:07,881 --> 00:29:10,451
-You good?
-Yeah.

296
00:29:27,268 --> 00:29:28,469
Tuck it in!

297
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:54,629
- Oh!
- Shit.

298
00:29:54,795 --> 00:29:56,731
Quick. Over there!

299
00:29:56,897 --> 00:29:58,499
Come on, come on, come on!

300
00:31:25,986 --> 00:31:28,590
Fuckin' masks!
Where the fuck are they?

301
00:31:32,861 --> 00:31:35,429
Got 'em!

302
00:31:36,798 --> 00:31:39,366
Fucking hell.

303
00:34:20,995 --> 00:34:22,764
Fuck.

304
00:34:29,537 --> 00:34:31,039
Fuck me.

305
00:34:31,204 --> 00:34:32,707
Hm, okay, you win.

306
00:34:36,578 --> 00:34:37,946
Really?

307
00:34:41,415 --> 00:34:43,785
Oh, fuck!

308
00:34:43,985 --> 00:34:46,521
-Want me to stop?
-No, no, keep going.

309
00:34:46,688 --> 00:34:48,523
Whatever you're doing
hurts like fucking fuck,

310
00:34:48,690 --> 00:34:50,257
but please keep going.

311
00:34:52,426 --> 00:34:53,928
Mmm!

312
00:34:54,094 --> 00:34:55,897
There, there, there,
there, there. Fuck me.

313
00:35:02,102 --> 00:35:04,237
So how long
you been doing this, then?

314
00:35:04,404 --> 00:35:06,440
Almost six years.

315
00:35:06,608 --> 00:35:08,943
Just recently opened
my own clinic.

316
00:35:09,109 --> 00:35:10,912
What about your hubby?
What did he do?

317
00:35:14,616 --> 00:35:16,551
He's in renewable energy.

318
00:35:16,718 --> 00:35:18,753
Every year, delegates from
the company he works for

319
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:20,287
have a big meet-up.

320
00:35:20,454 --> 00:35:21,623
This time around,
it was someone's

321
00:35:21,789 --> 00:35:23,725
bright idea to pick Tasmania.

322
00:35:23,891 --> 00:35:26,426
Huh. Shit, hey?

323
00:35:26,594 --> 00:35:28,328
What about you?

324
00:35:29,564 --> 00:35:33,101
I'm a builder. I got my own
little business in Melbourne.

325
00:35:34,301 --> 00:35:36,269
I was putting the frames up
on this old duck's reno

326
00:35:36,436 --> 00:35:38,338
when she brought me over
to the TV to watch the news.

327
00:35:40,808 --> 00:35:42,644
Did you lose anyone close?

328
00:35:54,154 --> 00:35:56,858
You hit the spot, Ava.
I think I'm all good.

329
00:36:07,001 --> 00:36:08,468
Where the hell
did he wander in from?

330
00:36:11,572 --> 00:36:14,876
Buddy, we're closed! Go be
a dead cunt somewhere else.

331
00:36:34,796 --> 00:36:35,963
Fuckin' hell.

332
00:36:44,539 --> 00:36:46,708
I noticed a pattern
with ones like him.

333
00:36:51,478 --> 00:36:53,581
The longer they go on,
the more agitated they become.

334
00:36:59,554 --> 00:37:01,189
They start to lash out.

335
00:37:15,837 --> 00:37:17,739
What are you two
doing down here?

336
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:20,608
Taroona's restricted.

337
00:37:20,808 --> 00:37:22,342
The whole south is.

338
00:37:24,846 --> 00:37:26,681
We're from body retrieval.

339
00:37:26,848 --> 00:37:28,950
I'm looking for someone.

340
00:37:30,184 --> 00:37:31,619
Who?

341
00:37:33,187 --> 00:37:34,956
My husband.

342
00:37:37,692 --> 00:37:40,928
And you? What's your story?

343
00:37:41,095 --> 00:37:43,631
-He's...
-I'm helping her get there.

344
00:37:43,831 --> 00:37:45,432
Chauffeur.

345
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:47,068
And where's that?

346
00:37:51,005 --> 00:37:52,240
Woodbridge.

347
00:37:56,878 --> 00:37:58,445
How'd you make it
through Hobart?

348
00:37:58,613 --> 00:38:01,048
Wasn't easy, mate.

349
00:38:01,215 --> 00:38:03,217
We had to find our way
around the smoke.

350
00:38:03,383 --> 00:38:05,052
It nearly cost us
our lungs, didn't it?

351
00:38:05,219 --> 00:38:06,486
Hmm.

352
00:38:08,089 --> 00:38:09,289
That's some bike
you got there.

353
00:38:10,725 --> 00:38:12,927
Yeah, she was a little dusty,

354
00:38:13,094 --> 00:38:14,662
but she'll be better
for the run.

355
00:38:14,862 --> 00:38:15,997
Take it for a spin.

356
00:38:21,636 --> 00:38:23,470
Come with me.

357
00:38:28,109 --> 00:38:29,744
He needs to make
an official statement.

358
00:38:29,911 --> 00:38:31,679
So do you, so wait in there.

359
00:38:31,879 --> 00:38:34,015
Chow down on whatever you
want and we'll be right back.

360
00:38:36,316 --> 00:38:37,952
It's alright, Ava.

361
00:38:38,119 --> 00:38:39,654
It was fun while it lasted.

362
00:38:48,763 --> 00:38:50,031
Sit tight.

363
00:38:54,268 --> 00:38:55,970
Let's go.

364
00:38:56,137 --> 00:38:58,272
So it's just you all
alone out here, is it, mate?

365
00:38:58,438 --> 00:39:00,508
-No unit?
-Into the kitchen.

366
00:39:00,675 --> 00:39:03,811
Hey, listen, I know
you've got to follow protocol,

367
00:39:03,978 --> 00:39:06,781
but can't we just
keep this in-house?

368
00:39:06,948 --> 00:39:08,716
No harm, no foul, right?

369
00:39:27,101 --> 00:39:28,903
I'm sorry, Mitch.

370
00:39:58,498 --> 00:40:00,400
Why didn't you
pick up when I called?

371
00:40:10,344 --> 00:40:13,514
You said you wanted
to talk, so let's talk.

372
00:40:39,006 --> 00:40:41,042
Some mate you got there.

373
00:40:42,543 --> 00:40:44,045
Bloke did a bloody runner.

374
00:40:46,347 --> 00:40:48,049
Said he needed to take a piss.

375
00:40:48,215 --> 00:40:49,482
I gave him
the benefit of the doubt

376
00:40:49,684 --> 00:40:51,085
and he left me in the dust.

377
00:40:51,252 --> 00:40:53,154
Spent the last couple of hours
trying to find him.

378
00:40:54,755 --> 00:40:56,257
They'll throw
the book at him now.

379
00:40:59,794 --> 00:41:01,829
Look, Ava.

380
00:41:04,966 --> 00:41:07,101
I know what
you're going through.

381
00:41:07,268 --> 00:41:09,270
Closure is important.

382
00:41:10,470 --> 00:41:14,175
So I'm gonna give you safe
passage through to Woodbridge.

383
00:41:15,242 --> 00:41:16,610
But...

384
00:41:18,079 --> 00:41:20,181
if you find your husband...

385
00:41:21,549 --> 00:41:23,184
I hope you understand
what that could mean.

386
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:28,923
And I also need to know that
you're not gonna do a runner.

387
00:41:31,092 --> 00:41:34,028
I... I'm not. I promise.

388
00:41:38,466 --> 00:41:41,202
We just need to pick up
a few things first, alright?

389
00:42:40,361 --> 00:42:42,096
How much further?

390
00:42:44,899 --> 00:42:46,267
Almost there.

391
00:43:08,355 --> 00:43:10,624
The place was run by
an old farmer and his wife.

392
00:43:10,825 --> 00:43:12,593
The whole place
was stocked with canned food

393
00:43:12,760 --> 00:43:14,095
before I stationed here.

394
00:43:15,930 --> 00:43:17,298
I found some meat
in the freezer.

395
00:43:18,567 --> 00:43:20,301
Another day or two
before it turns.

396
00:43:50,030 --> 00:43:52,266
Well, come on.

397
00:43:52,967 --> 00:43:55,504
I'm a half-decent cook
when I want to be.

398
00:43:55,703 --> 00:43:57,506
I thought you were just
picking up some things.

399
00:43:59,807 --> 00:44:01,442
I'm running on fumes.

400
00:44:01,610 --> 00:44:04,345
So, let's grab something
while we're here.

401
00:44:38,279 --> 00:44:40,114
Don't let it get cold.

402
00:44:40,281 --> 00:44:41,650
Try some of the corn.

403
00:44:46,020 --> 00:44:48,389
"If you're hungry,
you'll eat anything."

404
00:44:49,624 --> 00:44:51,392
That's what my dad
drilled into me since day dot.

405
00:44:52,661 --> 00:44:54,228
He was an army man too.

406
00:44:56,130 --> 00:44:57,398
He actually met a colonel once

407
00:44:57,599 --> 00:44:59,133
who was right there
when you Yanks

408
00:44:59,300 --> 00:45:01,502
first started toying around
with that pulse technology.

409
00:45:02,836 --> 00:45:03,904
Hmph.

410
00:45:05,306 --> 00:45:06,974
Of all the patches of ocean

411
00:45:07,141 --> 00:45:08,842
they could've tried it
out on, hey?

412
00:45:12,279 --> 00:45:13,814
It still doesn't seem real.

413
00:45:30,197 --> 00:45:32,066
Katie.

414
00:45:32,233 --> 00:45:33,602
My wife.

415
00:45:36,870 --> 00:45:38,906
We were expecting our first.

416
00:45:39,073 --> 00:45:41,275
A little boy,

417
00:45:41,475 --> 00:45:43,444
only a couple of weeks away.

418
00:45:48,916 --> 00:45:52,453
She was down here visiting
her folks in Queenstown.

419
00:45:53,555 --> 00:45:55,089
You don't mind if I...

420
00:45:59,694 --> 00:46:01,395
I was part
of a training exercise

421
00:46:01,563 --> 00:46:04,298
up in a place called
Townsville on the mainland.

422
00:46:04,498 --> 00:46:05,567
You know it?

423
00:46:19,113 --> 00:46:21,616
As soon as I heard
the island wasn't radioactive,

424
00:46:21,782 --> 00:46:25,386
I talked my way onto one of
the first choppers down here.

425
00:46:33,762 --> 00:46:35,496
Found them in the house.

426
00:46:37,464 --> 00:46:38,932
Katie's
childhood home.

427
00:46:42,369 --> 00:46:43,971
They were all, uh...

428
00:46:45,939 --> 00:46:48,175
sitting around
the kitchen table,

429
00:46:48,375 --> 00:46:50,144
middle of breakfast.

430
00:46:51,312 --> 00:46:53,347
Toast rack was still full.

431
00:46:56,050 --> 00:46:58,620
I picked out a nice-looking
tree in the backyard.

432
00:47:01,955 --> 00:47:05,359
This dinky little swing Katie
used to have as a girl

433
00:47:05,560 --> 00:47:07,127
still hanging from it.

434
00:47:11,165 --> 00:47:12,534
Started digging.

435
00:47:19,940 --> 00:47:22,042
Made it all as nice
as I could for 'em.

436
00:47:26,781 --> 00:47:28,215
I'm sorry.

437
00:47:37,091 --> 00:47:39,561
People, when they get sick,
you know, terminal...

438
00:47:42,029 --> 00:47:44,164
their loved ones,
they get that... that moment,

439
00:47:44,331 --> 00:47:46,166
the long goodbye.

440
00:47:47,802 --> 00:47:50,003
The way this went down,

441
00:47:50,170 --> 00:47:52,640
the rug getting pulled
like it did...

442
00:47:54,041 --> 00:47:55,376
I don't know.

443
00:47:57,378 --> 00:47:59,012
It was a special
kind of cruel.

444
00:48:10,157 --> 00:48:12,594
It meant everything, getting
to see her for myself.

445
00:48:15,530 --> 00:48:17,398
Don't know what
I would've done without that.

446
00:48:20,668 --> 00:48:23,605
She didn't come back?

447
00:48:38,820 --> 00:48:41,088
When are we leaving?

448
00:48:45,259 --> 00:48:46,628
Soon.

449
00:48:48,663 --> 00:48:51,633
Before we get going,
there's, um...

450
00:48:56,103 --> 00:48:58,540
something I need to ask you.

451
00:50:20,822 --> 00:50:22,657
Uh, how's it going in there?

452
00:50:25,994 --> 00:50:27,327
I'm ready.

453
00:50:35,637 --> 00:50:37,739
My hair's a little wet. Sorry.

454
00:50:39,507 --> 00:50:40,909
Your hair's fine.

455
00:50:42,544 --> 00:50:44,746
You saw she was
a redhead anyway.

456
00:50:46,380 --> 00:50:48,750
Just one dance. That's all.

457
00:50:51,218 --> 00:50:52,754
If you don't mind.

458
00:51:28,656 --> 00:51:30,625
Here.

459
00:51:30,825 --> 00:51:32,459
This will help.

460
00:52:09,229 --> 00:52:10,263
You're beautiful.

461
00:52:15,937 --> 00:52:17,572
I'm sorry, Katie.

462
00:52:19,073 --> 00:52:20,508
I love you.

463
00:52:22,275 --> 00:52:23,845
I'll always love you.

464
00:52:30,317 --> 00:52:32,086
I'm sorry I couldn't
protect you.

465
00:52:34,421 --> 00:52:35,857
Both of you.

466
00:52:45,667 --> 00:52:47,367
I can feel him in there.

467
00:52:56,844 --> 00:52:58,513
Oh, what a trip.

468
00:53:08,656 --> 00:53:10,290
That's not it.

469
00:53:12,760 --> 00:53:14,162
You're not wearing it.

470
00:53:16,329 --> 00:53:17,632
You...

471
00:53:18,766 --> 00:53:20,001
You're not wearing it.

472
00:53:20,168 --> 00:53:21,803
The song's ending.

473
00:53:23,171 --> 00:53:25,372
I told you to put everything
on, the ring as well.

474
00:53:25,540 --> 00:53:26,908
The song's over.

475
00:53:28,943 --> 00:53:31,679
Do you mind swapping it out?

476
00:53:31,846 --> 00:53:33,848
You said one dance. We danced.

477
00:53:34,015 --> 00:53:35,382
Now, please take me
to my husband.

478
00:53:35,550 --> 00:53:36,918
But, uh...

479
00:53:38,351 --> 00:53:39,921
But...

480
00:53:41,221 --> 00:53:43,558
You ruined it. I...

481
00:53:44,792 --> 00:53:46,259
You ruined everything.

482
00:53:46,460 --> 00:53:48,596
Uh, I'm sorry.
It's... it's my fault.

483
00:53:48,796 --> 00:53:50,665
I should have double-checked.

484
00:53:50,832 --> 00:53:53,201
Uh... Can you
please put it on?

485
00:53:53,366 --> 00:53:54,936
No. I'm not
taking my ring off.

486
00:54:07,014 --> 00:54:09,183
We need to start again.

487
00:54:09,349 --> 00:54:11,786
I'm not taking off my ring.
I'm not starting again.

488
00:54:11,986 --> 00:54:13,955
Please. I played my part.

489
00:54:19,994 --> 00:54:21,394
Put it on...

490
00:54:22,597 --> 00:54:24,397
or our deal's over.

491
00:54:27,835 --> 00:54:29,269
Stay back.

492
00:54:32,272 --> 00:54:33,808
Ava...

493
00:54:35,375 --> 00:54:37,044
I said stay back!

494
00:54:37,211 --> 00:54:39,046
Arggh!

495
00:54:39,213 --> 00:54:41,249
No...

496
00:54:41,414 --> 00:54:44,417
Hey, hey! Wait! No!

497
00:54:44,585 --> 00:54:46,721
-Ava!
-Stay the fuck away from me!

498
00:54:46,888 --> 00:54:48,556
I'm not your fucking wife!

499
00:54:48,723 --> 00:54:51,125
Leave me alone, please!

500
00:54:51,291 --> 00:54:52,593
Leave me alone!

501
00:54:54,896 --> 00:54:57,098
Ava, open the door.

502
00:54:58,866 --> 00:55:00,601
Please, just come out of
there, okay? Let me explain.

503
00:55:02,402 --> 00:55:03,638
Ava!

504
00:55:04,972 --> 00:55:06,339
Oh, my God.

505
00:55:09,442 --> 00:55:11,746
You want to know why only
some of them come back?

506
00:55:11,913 --> 00:55:13,915
It's 'cause they're the ones
with unfinished business.

507
00:55:15,082 --> 00:55:17,084
Like Katie.

508
00:55:17,251 --> 00:55:18,820
She wasn't ready to go.
It wasn't her time yet.

509
00:55:18,986 --> 00:55:20,588
All she wanted
was to be a mum.

510
00:55:20,755 --> 00:55:22,757
And she will.
She'll be a great mum.

511
00:55:24,457 --> 00:55:27,028
Ava, open the door.

512
00:55:30,497 --> 00:55:32,033
Please, Ava.
You don't understand.

513
00:55:34,836 --> 00:55:38,039
He's alive. I felt him kick.

514
00:55:39,640 --> 00:55:40,942
He's waiting for his mum.

515
00:55:41,108 --> 00:55:43,044
He's waiting for me.

516
00:55:47,148 --> 00:55:49,717
Open the fuckin' door!

517
00:55:49,917 --> 00:55:52,485
Ava! Open it!

518
00:55:52,653 --> 00:55:56,057
Ava, come out of there!
Come out of there!

519
00:55:58,960 --> 00:56:01,896
Just listen to me! Please!

520
00:56:09,136 --> 00:56:10,671
Ava!

521
00:56:52,146 --> 00:56:53,514
Ava!

522
00:56:54,715 --> 00:56:56,117
Ava!

523
00:57:04,525 --> 00:57:06,027
Ava?

524
00:57:08,229 --> 00:57:09,530
Ava?

525
00:57:14,568 --> 00:57:15,736
Come on.

526
00:57:20,942 --> 00:57:22,576
Ava?

527
00:57:29,417 --> 00:57:31,886
Ava,
come out of there.

528
00:57:32,053 --> 00:57:33,654
It's not safe.

529
00:57:37,258 --> 00:57:38,826
They're getting
more hostile by the day.

530
00:57:42,563 --> 00:57:44,298
Look.

531
00:57:44,464 --> 00:57:45,633
I'm sorry, alright?

532
00:57:50,071 --> 00:57:51,405
Ava?

533
00:57:55,910 --> 00:57:58,179
Ava, come on. Just come out
and we can make things right.

534
00:58:00,047 --> 00:58:01,582
I said I'd take you
to your husband.

535
00:58:03,918 --> 00:58:05,419
We can still do that.

536
00:58:10,925 --> 00:58:12,492
Just come out of there.

537
00:58:15,629 --> 00:58:16,998
Ava, come on.

538
00:58:18,466 --> 00:58:19,800
You can't stay
in here all night.

539
00:58:24,505 --> 00:58:26,440
Sweetie, I can't find my ring.

540
00:58:26,607 --> 00:58:28,275
Did you see it?

541
00:58:37,018 --> 00:58:39,020
Shall we go get it?

542
00:58:39,186 --> 00:58:41,122
Then we can finish our dance.

543
00:58:47,628 --> 00:58:48,963
Come out of there.

544
00:59:18,793 --> 00:59:20,261
Oh, you poor thing.

545
00:59:21,495 --> 00:59:22,863
Let me patch you up.

546
00:59:25,666 --> 00:59:26,700
Would you?

547
00:59:26,867 --> 00:59:28,269
Of course.

548
00:59:50,958 --> 00:59:52,293
It's too late, Ava.

549
00:59:55,564 --> 00:59:57,298
You ruined it.

550
01:00:02,571 --> 01:00:03,737
You shouldn't have ruined...

551
01:00:03,904 --> 01:00:05,206
Ugh!

552
01:01:56,383 --> 01:01:58,819
Please, Mitch. Please stay.

553
01:02:03,958 --> 01:02:05,826
I don't think that's
a good idea right now.

554
01:02:10,532 --> 01:02:12,433
Well, at least let me
drive you to the airport.

555
01:02:16,837 --> 01:02:18,105
No...

556
01:02:20,307 --> 01:02:21,509
The car's almost here.

557
01:02:26,981 --> 01:02:29,083
I'll be back in a week.
Let's talk then.

558
01:05:19,219 --> 01:05:20,722
Oh!

559
01:05:33,367 --> 01:05:35,302
Oh, please!

560
01:05:38,405 --> 01:05:39,641
Arggh!

561
01:10:16,951 --> 01:10:18,519
<i>Just a little further.</i>

562
01:10:23,124 --> 01:10:24,826
<i>Just a little further.</i>

563
01:14:30,738 --> 01:14:32,173
Hi, babe.

564
01:14:45,720 --> 01:14:47,121
I'm here.

565
01:15:46,881 --> 01:15:48,149
She's pretty.

566
01:15:52,887 --> 01:15:54,188
Was pretty.

567
01:16:06,734 --> 01:16:08,269
Well...

568
01:16:10,971 --> 01:16:12,273
...nothing to report?

569
01:16:14,308 --> 01:16:16,545
No unfinished business?

570
01:16:20,247 --> 01:16:21,550
Here I am.

571
01:16:23,150 --> 01:16:25,186
I'm right here, Mitch.

572
01:16:28,322 --> 01:16:29,957
We're just gonna leave
this giant fucking mess

573
01:16:30,157 --> 01:16:31,459
the way it is?

574
01:16:35,096 --> 01:16:36,464
Wake up.

575
01:16:38,099 --> 01:16:40,134
Please, wake up.

576
01:16:40,334 --> 01:16:41,969
Mitch?

577
01:16:42,169 --> 01:16:44,605
Mitch, please.

578
01:16:44,772 --> 01:16:46,140
Please, wake up.

579
01:16:47,208 --> 01:16:48,609
Please.

580
01:17:08,262 --> 01:17:09,063
Ava?

581
01:17:10,532 --> 01:17:11,632
Ava?

582
01:17:11,799 --> 01:17:12,567
Mitch?

583
01:17:36,223 --> 01:17:37,958
I wanted to start IVF.

584
01:17:40,027 --> 01:17:41,795
He said we just
had to give it time.

585
01:17:45,166 --> 01:17:46,601
We started fighting.

586
01:17:47,902 --> 01:17:49,203
A lot.

587
01:17:51,972 --> 01:17:54,175
I didn't know what we were
to each other anymore.

588
01:17:57,811 --> 01:17:59,313
I hooked up with someone.

589
01:18:02,016 --> 01:18:04,619
I told Mitch about it
before he flew down here.

590
01:18:06,621 --> 01:18:08,389
I thought
if I could find him...

591
01:18:09,823 --> 01:18:11,392
...any version of him...

592
01:18:13,595 --> 01:18:15,462
...that I could
somehow fix things.

593
01:18:17,264 --> 01:18:18,999
But I can't.

594
01:18:59,073 --> 01:19:01,075
Hannah, my daughter,

595
01:19:01,242 --> 01:19:02,843
and her mum Bridgette.

596
01:19:04,546 --> 01:19:06,113
They don't want
anything to do with me.

597
01:19:09,383 --> 01:19:11,285
I thought I'd come down here.

598
01:19:13,187 --> 01:19:15,956
Show them how selfless I am.

599
01:19:16,156 --> 01:19:18,926
Thought maybe they'd see me
in a new light or something.

600
01:19:20,761 --> 01:19:23,264
I called Bridgette and
told her I was pitching in.

601
01:19:25,899 --> 01:19:27,468
A big fuckin' hero.

602
01:19:32,339 --> 01:19:33,874
She told me to get fucked.

603
01:19:36,377 --> 01:19:38,245
I came down anyway.

604
01:19:38,412 --> 01:19:40,582
I thought I'd...
still show her.

605
01:19:42,684 --> 01:19:44,218
Believe it or not,

606
01:19:44,385 --> 01:19:46,787
sometimes I just
can't get out of my own way.

607
01:19:49,123 --> 01:19:50,491
Stupid.

608
01:20:08,543 --> 01:20:09,810
Anyway...

609
01:20:11,546 --> 01:20:13,515
how'd you get away
from that fuckin' psycho?

610
01:20:17,918 --> 01:20:19,153
You first.

611
01:21:26,821 --> 01:21:28,088
Ava...

612
01:21:28,288 --> 01:21:29,691
Ava!

613
01:23:16,129 --> 01:23:18,533
Phew! Just like
old times, hey, partner?

614
01:23:19,968 --> 01:23:21,703
Are you gonna hurl?

615
01:23:27,474 --> 01:23:28,877
Oh, shit.

616
01:23:30,310 --> 01:23:31,546
Sorry, Ava.

617
01:23:31,746 --> 01:23:33,213
Are you fucking serious?

618
01:23:33,413 --> 01:23:34,716
Sorry.

619
01:23:36,016 --> 01:23:37,150
Fuck!

620
01:25:02,102 --> 01:25:04,973
Your move, ginger.

621
01:25:10,612 --> 01:25:12,814
I'll just go around her...

622
01:25:13,014 --> 01:25:14,314
What the fuck are you doing?

623
01:25:15,717 --> 01:25:16,818
Fuck.

624
01:25:19,186 --> 01:25:20,722
Ava?

625
01:25:28,730 --> 01:25:30,430
What's she waiting for?

626
01:26:26,921 --> 01:26:27,889
Ava!

627
01:27:10,565 --> 01:27:12,100
Hey.

628
01:27:14,569 --> 01:27:15,937
Here.

629
01:27:17,504 --> 01:27:20,541
Hey, hey.

630
01:27:20,708 --> 01:27:23,845
Hey, you're okay.

631
01:27:24,011 --> 01:27:26,781
Hey.

632
01:27:26,981 --> 01:27:28,616
Hey.

633
01:27:33,386 --> 01:27:36,090
Hey, shh.

634
01:27:36,256 --> 01:27:38,960
You're okay. You're okay.

635
01:27:40,427 --> 01:27:41,963
Hey.

636
01:27:44,232 --> 01:27:45,633
You're okay.
