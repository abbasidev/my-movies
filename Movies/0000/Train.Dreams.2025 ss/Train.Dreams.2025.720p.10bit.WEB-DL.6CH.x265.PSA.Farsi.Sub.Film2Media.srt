[Gladys] I missed you. [kisses]

197

I missed you.

Oh, Gladys.

-[Gladys] Oh God.
-God, yes.

204
00:12:23,416 --> 00:12:25,333
Oh, shh. Shh.

205
00:12:26,416 --> 00:12:28,083
I just got her to sleep.

206
00:12:29,416 --> 00:12:30,541
Is she...

207
00:12:31,333 --> 00:12:32,333
Go see her.

208
00:12:35,333 --> 00:12:37,809
-[Robert] She's just gotten so big.
-[Gladys] Mmm.

209

[exhales sharply]

210
00:12:39,625 --> 00:12:41,601
She's starting to look like you.

211
00:12:41,625 --> 00:12:42,726
Mmm.

212
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:45,333
At least she's starting
to favor one of us.

213
00:12:50,666 --> 00:12:52,500
No broken fingers this time?

214
00:12:53,083 --> 00:12:54,458
[Robert] I don't think so.

215
00:12:55,625 --> 00:12:57,392
I didn't think you'd be home this soon.

216
00:12:57,416 --> 00:13:00,416
I just couldn't stop walking
until I got here.

217

[sniffles]

218
00:13:06,416 --> 00:13:08,000
-Look at that.
-Oh.

219
00:13:11,291 --> 00:13:14,458
I didn't expect that much
after what you already sent.

220
00:13:14,958 --> 00:13:17,142
We hit a soft stand at the end there.

[Robert sniffles]

228
00:13:34,208 --> 00:13:36,184
Let's have a big dinner tonight.

229
00:13:36,208 --> 00:13:38,351
Well, don't go to too much trouble.

230
00:13:38,375 --> 00:13:39,684

-[Gladys chuckles softly]
-[kissing]

234
00:13:48,250 --> 00:13:50,767
[Gladys] No, come on.
Let me show you something.

235
00:13:50,791 --> 00:13:52,875
[gentle music continues]

236
00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:02,517
[Gladys] You see any of the same old guys?

237
00:14:02,541 --> 00:14:05,184
[Robert] Yeah.
I saw a couple from the Oregon job.

238
00:14:05,208 --> 00:14:07,583
They got good stories?

239
00:14:08,625 --> 00:14:12,416
[Robert] Yeah. They got good stories,
whether any of them are true or not.

240
00:14:18,416 --> 00:14:20,500
[softly] She's watching the candle. Look.

241
00:14:21,875 --> 00:14:23,809
[Gladys] Look at that. Can you see?

242
00:14:23,833 --> 00:14:24,934
[gasps]

243
00:14:24,958 --> 00:14:26,500
Isn't that nice?

244
00:14:27,041 --> 00:14:28,041
[Robert] Hey, honey.

245
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,333
Yeah. [chuckles]

246

-[baby crying]
-[shushing]

247
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:36,541
[Robert] Mmm.

248
00:14:37,708 --> 00:14:39,601
-You want me to feed you?
-[Gladys laughs]

249
00:14:39,625 --> 00:14:40,642
-[baby crying]
-Hmm?

250
00:14:40,666 --> 00:14:42,642
-[Gladys] Give me some of that chicken.
-Mmm...

251
00:14:42,666 --> 00:14:44,767
-Mmm...
-[both laughing]

252
00:14:44,791 --> 00:14:46,476

[laughing]

254
00:14:49,708 --> 00:14:51,059
-[Gladys] Oh, come on.
-Mmm.

255

-[Gladys shushing]
-[baby crying]

256
00:14:53,291 --> 00:14:55,375
-She need to sleep?
-Yeah.

257
00:14:57,291 --> 00:14:59,291
[crying continues]

258
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:02,392
[Gladys humming]

259
00:15:02,416 --> 00:15:03,458
[Robert] Oh.

260
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:05,309
Yes.

261
00:15:05,333 --> 00:15:06,958
[Gladys continues humming]

262
00:15:08,833 --> 00:15:10,333
[birds chirping]

263
00:15:18,041 --> 00:15:19,125
What do you think?

264
00:15:23,375 --> 00:15:25,583
It's a pretty funny-looking bassinet.

265
00:15:26,208 --> 00:15:28,333
[Robert laughing]

266
00:15:28,958 --> 00:15:31,208
-[Gladys] It's a fish trap.
-[laughing]

267
00:15:32,208 --> 00:15:33,517
-[baby cooing]
-Oh.

268
00:15:33,541 --> 00:15:34,851
Bassinet.

269
00:15:34,875 --> 00:15:37,791
[gentle music continues]

270
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:43,750

[breathes deeply]

281
00:16:29,958 --> 00:16:30,976
[Robert] Uh...

282
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,416
[inhales deeply]

283
00:16:33,250 --> 00:16:34,934
Did she, uh, wake up?

284
00:16:34,958 --> 00:16:36,041
[clears throat]

285
00:16:39,208 --> 00:16:40,291
Was she crying?

286
00:16:41,125 --> 00:16:43,500
-Not too bad.
-[Robert inhales sharply]

287
00:16:44,208 --> 00:16:46,142
She just woke up hungry.

288
00:16:46,166 --> 00:16:47,208
[Robert] Mmm.

289
00:16:48,250 --> 00:16:50,309
[inhales deeply]

290
00:16:50,333 --> 00:16:53,059
Do you know
what all her cries mean? [exhales]

291
00:16:53,083 --> 00:16:54,309
[Gladys chuckles]

292
00:16:54,333 --> 00:16:55,791
Most of them, I guess.

293
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:00,916
How much does she know, do you think?

294
00:17:02,416 --> 00:17:03,416
I don't know.

295
00:17:03,958 --> 00:17:04,958
[Robert] Hmm.

296
00:17:05,833 --> 00:17:08,083
As much as a dog pup?

297
00:17:10,125 --> 00:17:14,416
Well, a dog pup can live on its own
after its mama weans it away.

298
00:17:16,250 --> 00:17:19,500
A baby couldn't just go off and live
after it was weaned.

299
00:17:21,333 --> 00:17:25,017
A dog knows more than a baby
till the baby knows its words,

300
00:17:25,041 --> 00:17:27,125
and not just a few words.

301
00:17:28,791 --> 00:17:31,351
A dog raised around the house
knows some words too...

302
00:17:31,375 --> 00:17:33,708
-[baby coos]
-...as many as a baby at least.

303
00:17:35,458 --> 00:17:36,851
What words?

304
00:17:36,875 --> 00:17:38,267
[inhales deeply]

305
00:17:38,291 --> 00:17:40,166
I just want to hear your voice.

306
00:17:43,166 --> 00:17:45,934
Well, fetch

307
00:17:45,958 --> 00:17:49,041
and come.

308
00:17:50,791 --> 00:17:53,791
Lay and sit

309
00:17:54,791 --> 00:17:56,184
and roll over.

310
00:17:56,208 --> 00:17:57,500
[Robert chuckles softly]

311
00:17:58,250 --> 00:18:00,958
Whatever it knows to do,
it knows the words.

312
00:18:01,458 --> 00:18:03,458
[wolves howling in distance]

313
00:18:05,958 --> 00:18:08,416
Do you think that she knows
that I'm her daddy?

314
00:18:10,291 --> 00:18:11,500
Of course she does.

315
00:18:13,791 --> 00:18:15,458
Deep down, she knows it...

316
00:18:17,458 --> 00:18:21,250
even if she doesn't know she knows it yet.

317
00:18:25,708 --> 00:18:26,708
Don't worry.

318
00:18:28,250 --> 00:18:30,726
You'll have plenty of time
to be her daddy.

319
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:33,291
[joyful music playing]

320
00:18:36,291 --> 00:18:38,291

324
00:18:59,250 --> 00:19:00,750
[Gladys] Nice having you home.

325
00:19:01,375 --> 00:19:02,375
[Robert] Hmm.

326
00:19:04,083 --> 00:19:06,708
-[Gladys] I don't want you to disappear.
-Mmm.

327
00:19:11,291 --> 00:19:12,291
There you go.

328
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:14,500
Yeah.

329
00:19:16,083 --> 00:19:18,226
-[chuckling] No. Don't eat it.
-Does it smell nice?

330
00:19:18,250 --> 00:19:19,250
[both chuckle]

331
00:19:20,958 --> 00:19:22,851
[photographer] Sorry.
Just one more minute.

332
00:19:22,875 --> 00:19:24,958
[joyful music continues]

333
00:19:28,791 --> 00:19:30,791
Should I put my hand in my pocket?

334
00:19:31,958 --> 00:19:33,166
What do you think?

335
00:19:34,791 --> 00:19:36,916

-Oop. [chuckles]

359
00:21:05,083 --> 00:21:06,184
I got a problem...

360
00:21:06,208 --> 00:21:07,750
<i>There was Apostle Frank,</i>

361
00:21:08,416 --> 00:21:11,642
<i>a faller who spoke about the Bible
with such familiarity</i>

362
00:21:11,666 --> 00:21:14,976
<i>as to suggest he'd been there
when it was all written down.</i>

363
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,458
It's like that old boy Balaam
in the Bible.

364
00:21:18,041 --> 00:21:22,101
Sometimes God has to find strange ways
to tell you what you need to hear.

365
00:21:22,125 --> 00:21:26,309
Sometimes it's a donkey talking to you,
sometimes it's a who knows.

366
00:21:26,333 --> 00:21:27,809
I was in Nebraska once.

367
00:21:27,833 --> 00:21:30,476
The Lord spoke to my heart,
told me to go to Omaha.

368
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:33,684
When I got off the train,
the sign said "Opelika."

369
00:21:33,708 --> 00:21:35,351
I said, "Opelika?"

370
00:21:35,375 --> 00:21:38,017
And that's when I knew
my eyes were busted.

371
00:21:38,041 --> 00:21:41,601
Praise God and hallelujah.

372
00:21:41,625 --> 00:21:43,309
[panting] I think that's it.

373
00:21:43,333 --> 00:21:45,892
-You get what I'm saying in general?
-Mm-hmm.

374
00:21:45,916 --> 00:21:47,601
So he touched his hip, God did.

375
00:21:47,625 --> 00:21:50,601
And for the rest of Jacob's life,
he walked with a bad limp.

376
00:21:50,625 --> 00:21:52,226
See, Jacob was an all-rounder.

377
00:21:52,250 --> 00:21:55,184
Handled his affairs
with no help from nobody.

378
00:21:55,208 --> 00:21:57,458

Come here, chicken.

523
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,059

-They're going inside.

-Chicken!

526

Chicken!

527
00:30:59,666 --> 00:31:03,434
They're gonna sleep in your bed,
and they're gonna eat your food.

-[Gladys] You want to shoot?
-[Robert] No.

538
00:31:48,875 --> 00:31:50,892
Only the deer want me to shoot.

539
00:31:50,916 --> 00:31:52,166
Gladys.

540
00:31:54,166 --> 00:31:55,250
[softly] Don't shoot.

541
00:31:56,250 --> 00:31:57,333
Don't shoot me.

-Keep making noise, and I will.
-[laughs]

543

[owl hooting]

548
00:32:26,541 --> 00:32:28,250
[Gladys] What if we came with you?

549
00:32:28,791 --> 00:32:29,791
[Robert] Hmm?

550
00:32:30,458 --> 00:32:31,666
Out to the cut.

551
00:32:33,958 --> 00:32:35,601
-To the cut?
-Mmm.

552
00:32:35,625 --> 00:32:36,601
What...

553
00:32:36,625 --> 00:32:38,517
Well, I... I'd be helpful.

554
00:32:38,541 --> 00:32:41,375
I... I could make some money
washing clothes.

555
00:32:42,458 --> 00:32:45,083
-Now she's not so much to keep up with.
-[exhales deeply]

556
00:32:45,791 --> 00:32:47,351
Well, I know you'd be helpful.

557
00:32:47,375 --> 00:32:50,809
You told me some of the others
have had their wives out there.

558
00:32:50,833 --> 00:32:54,101
No, not <i>some</i> of the others,
just that one old man.

559
00:32:54,125 --> 00:32:56,059
What, and that young couple
from California?

560
00:32:56,083 --> 00:32:59,184
Dick Clinton disappeared after a week.

561
00:32:59,208 --> 00:33:03,101
And then, besides,
they didn't even have a little one.

562
00:33:03,125 --> 00:33:04,416
It's, uh...

[inhales deeply]

564
00:33:06,750 --> 00:33:08,291

[Robert sighs]

567
00:33:22,583 --> 00:33:23,583

568
00:33:25,375 --> 00:33:27,041

Yeah, that is kind of an egg.

[Gladys] <i>Maybe there's a better way.</i>

606
00:35:16,833 --> 00:35:19,125
Maybe we turn our acre into a farm.

607
00:35:19,916 --> 00:35:22,517
I could grow double what I do now.

608
00:35:22,541 --> 00:35:27,642
And if we did that, and we saved up enough
to start a little sawmill,

609
00:35:27,666 --> 00:35:29,726
maybe you could be home more.

610
00:35:29,750 --> 00:35:33,726
Get a horse or a mule on credit, I guess.

611
00:35:33,750 --> 00:35:35,375
Yeah, on credit for sure.

612
00:35:36,458 --> 00:35:39,226
The sawmill would take
a bit more doing, you know.

613

It's not so cheap, but...

614

Yeah. Well, I didn't say it wouldn't be.

I can't decide.

I ain't never happy
when the job ends for some reason.

I just feel itchy inside.

652
00:38:04,083 --> 00:38:08,083
That's 'cause it's rough work, gentlemen,
not just on the body but on the soul.

653
00:38:09,625 --> 00:38:12,500
We just cut down trees
that have been here for 500 years.

654
00:38:13,708 --> 00:38:16,416
It upsets a man's soul
whether you recognize it or not.

655
00:38:18,250 --> 00:38:20,500
[logger 2] I'll have $200
in my pocket tomorrow morning.

656

Don't bother my soul. Not one damn bit.

657
00:38:25,875 --> 00:38:29,059
That's 'cause you Minnesota fellas
don't know nothing about history.

658
00:38:29,083 --> 00:38:31,351
These trees are really that old?

659
00:38:31,375 --> 00:38:32,916
[Arn] Why, some's older even.

660
00:38:33,583 --> 00:38:37,041
This world is intricately
stitched together, boys.

661
00:38:38,166 --> 00:38:42,250
Every thread we pull, we know not
how it affects the design of things.

662
00:38:43,375 --> 00:38:47,017
We're but children on this earth,

That's horseshit.
I've been to Washington too.

Cut all up through Canada
and back down again.

666

There's enough logs
for us to cut for 1,000 years.

667
00:39:01,250 --> 00:39:02,642
And then when the last one's cut,

668
00:39:02,666 --> 00:39:06,375
well, first one will be growed up
as big as anything around today.

669
00:39:09,166 --> 00:39:12,041
I remember thinking the same thing
when I was a young man...

670
00:39:13,458 --> 00:39:14,833

[Arn] What's her name? Your missus?

678
00:39:51,458 --> 00:39:52,476
Gladys.

679
00:39:52,500 --> 00:39:53,500
Mmm.

680
00:39:54,083 --> 00:39:57,000
Welsh. That's a highborn name.

681
00:39:58,750 --> 00:40:01,041
That makes sense, if you knew her.

682
00:40:02,625 --> 00:40:04,333
Those old names have power.

683
00:40:05,250 --> 00:40:07,375
The ones that have them are blessed.

00:40:08,250 --> 00:40:09,250
[Robert] Hmm.

685
00:40:11,250 --> 00:40:13,000
You got family somewhere?

My family is...

everywhere there's a smiling face.

689
00:40:21,500 --> 00:40:24,125
Never been somewhere
I didn't have some family there.

690
00:40:25,708 --> 00:40:26,726
Except for Kansas.

691
00:40:26,750 --> 00:40:29,476
That state is a collection
of savage lunatics.

693
00:40:34,541 --> 00:40:36,208
It's good having you around.

694
00:40:36,791 --> 00:40:40,375
Not too many folks I cross paths with
more than once in this life.

695
00:40:41,333 --> 00:40:44,083
I see it as a blessing
when they're brought back around.

696
00:40:44,750 --> 00:40:45,750

Red Dog was in heat?

what if she encountered the chief wolf

957
00:57:41,083 --> 00:57:42,416
at the exact moment?

958
00:57:43,458 --> 00:57:44,559
You know what I mean?

959
00:57:44,583 --> 00:57:49,875
Would he not take her
just for the newness of the experience?

I mean,
I can't believe you're still out here.

1039
01:03:13,500 --> 01:03:15,583
I can barely keep up at my age.

1040
01:03:16,083 --> 01:03:18,767
Ah, well, I just
look after the steam donkey

1041
01:03:18,791 --> 01:03:20,958
and keep it watered and greased.

1042
01:03:21,833 --> 01:03:25,083
Not much else I can do, but it's a living.

-Mmm.
-[Billy] Mmm.

1044
01:03:32,333 --> 01:03:37,833
Say, Billy, do you think
it's a little different now out here?

1045
01:03:39,708 --> 01:03:42,559
I don't know if it's different
or if it's always been this way.

1046
01:03:42,583 --> 01:03:45,666
Maybe I was rougher
and just like these boys.

1047
01:03:46,208 --> 01:03:48,291
I, uh, just don't remember it.

that is the age-old question,

ain't it, friend?

[Robert] Yeah.

1052

How... How is...

1054
01:04:08,375 --> 01:04:10,583
I ain't seen him in, gosh...

1056
01:04:20,125 --> 01:04:22,333
Yeah. Uh, no.

1057
01:04:23,625 --> 01:04:26,291
Yeah. I... I ain't seen him either.

Three thousand feet of ice.

it just flooded the whole region.

if you were back here then?

This big block of ice,
thousands of feet tall,

1174

and the freezing-cold water.

like the world was coming to an end.

[Robert] Hmm.

you know?

1272

Miss Thompson?

1273
01:17:37,958 --> 01:17:39,208
Are you up there?

1274
01:17:40,416 --> 01:17:41,833
[bird cawing]

1275

[Robert panting]

1276
01:17:46,125 --> 01:17:47,476
[Claire] Robert?

1277
01:17:47,500 --> 01:17:49,017
[Robert] Oh.

1278
01:17:49,041 --> 01:17:51,476
-[Claire] What a surprise. [chuckles]
-[chuckles]

1279
01:17:51,500 --> 01:17:52,767
How are you?

1280
01:17:52,791 --> 01:17:53,833
Good.

1281
01:17:54,541 --> 01:17:57,476
Yeah. I hope I didn't startle you.

1282
01:17:57,500 --> 01:17:58,517
No. Not at all.

1283
01:17:58,541 --> 01:18:01,559
[chuckling] I was just heading out
for an afternoon survey,

1284
01:18:01,583 --> 01:18:03,309
and... and I heard you call.

1285
01:18:03,333 --> 01:18:04,708
-[Robert] Oh, yeah.
-[chuckles]

1286
01:18:05,208 --> 01:18:06,976
-Yeah, I... [chuckles]
-Did you... [chuckles]

1287
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:08,559
I was just passing through

1288
01:18:08,583 --> 01:18:12,125
and thought I'd just,
you know, check on you.

1289
01:18:14,708 --> 01:18:16,833
[Robert] Doesn't get spooky up this high?

1290
01:18:17,375 --> 01:18:19,541
No. I think it's peaceful.

1291
01:18:21,041 --> 01:18:24,059
I watch the clouds form
and the light change,

1292
01:18:24,083 --> 01:18:26,517
and I get paid to do it.

1293
01:18:26,541 --> 01:18:28,208
-It's a gift.
-[chuckles softly]

1294
01:18:29,083 --> 01:18:31,041
Mmm, yeah, I can see that.

1295
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:37,625
How'd you come to this?

1296
01:18:38,416 --> 01:18:41,059
I saw a flyer for the job opening

1297
01:18:41,083 --> 01:18:42,416
just when I needed it.

1298
01:18:43,125 --> 01:18:44,809
Here, fire weed.

1299
01:18:44,833 --> 01:18:46,166
Oh, thank you.

1300
01:18:47,583 --> 01:18:50,250
I had to get a recommendation
from a family friend.

1301
01:18:51,166 --> 01:18:52,517
In his words,

1302
01:18:52,541 --> 01:18:54,809
"Claire Thompson is absolutely devoid

1303
01:18:54,833 --> 01:18:57,767
of the timidity normally associated
with her sex."

1304
01:18:57,791 --> 01:19:00,726
"She possesses
more than adequate work ethic..."

1305
01:19:00,750 --> 01:19:01,809
[Robert chuckles]

1306
01:19:01,833 --> 01:19:05,517
"...and is unafraid of anything
that walks, creeps, or flies."

1307
01:19:05,541 --> 01:19:07,375
[Robert laughs]

1308
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:09,684
[sipping] Hmm.

1309
01:19:09,708 --> 01:19:10,976
How is it?

1310
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:12,184
[Robert] Mmm.

1311
01:19:12,208 --> 01:19:13,750
It's good. Thank you.

1312
01:19:19,500 --> 01:19:20,875
[Robert exhales]

1313
01:19:22,250 --> 01:19:25,500
Everything looks so small from up here.

1314
01:19:27,416 --> 01:19:28,458
[Claire] Yeah.

1315
01:19:31,458 --> 01:19:33,059
You want to take a look?

1316
01:19:33,083 --> 01:19:35,166
[birds chirping]

1317
01:19:40,541 --> 01:19:42,726
-[Robert] Everything grows so fast.
-Mm-hmm.

1318
01:19:42,750 --> 01:19:45,392
You can barely tell
a fire came through here.

1319
01:19:45,416 --> 01:19:47,166
It's like it didn't even happen.

1320
01:19:55,708 --> 01:19:57,500
Were you here when it came through?

1321
01:20:01,708 --> 01:20:02,791
[exhales]

1322
01:20:03,625 --> 01:20:04,625
No.

1323
01:20:06,541 --> 01:20:07,541
I wasn't.

1324
01:20:10,250 --> 01:20:11,250
But, uh...

1325
01:20:12,708 --> 01:20:16,916
my wife and... and my baby, uh...

1326
01:20:17,958 --> 01:20:19,541
[inhales shakily]

1327
01:20:21,625 --> 01:20:24,041
Yeah. They, uh... They didn't make it out.

1328
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:26,434
Oh, Robert.

1329
01:20:26,458 --> 01:20:29,767
Yeah. You see, sometimes it... it...

1330
01:20:29,791 --> 01:20:31,934
[inhales deeply]

1331
01:20:31,958 --> 01:20:35,458
It feels like the sadness
will just eat me alive, but...

1332
01:20:38,125 --> 01:20:42,416
sometimes it just... It feels like it...
it happened to somebody else.

1333
01:20:46,625 --> 01:20:48,333
But no, I wasn't here.

1334
01:20:50,291 --> 01:20:51,267
[clicks tongue]

1335
01:20:51,291 --> 01:20:52,791
Uh, not when, uh...

1336
01:20:54,583 --> 01:20:57,267
Not when...
when I should have been, I guess,

1337
01:20:57,291 --> 01:21:01,291
and when... when, uh,
they needed me the most.

1338
01:21:09,500 --> 01:21:10,833
I hear them sometimes.

1339
01:21:13,458 --> 01:21:14,791
Out there in the woods.

1340
01:21:16,791 --> 01:21:19,125
Just talking and laughing.

1341
01:21:21,166 --> 01:21:22,166
Yeah.

1342
01:21:23,500 --> 01:21:26,791
I don't even want to turn my head
because I'm afraid...

1343
01:21:28,541 --> 01:21:31,375
that I'll scare them away.

1344
01:21:34,791 --> 01:21:35,875
So I just listen...

1345
01:21:39,458 --> 01:21:41,291
until they fade away somewhere else...

1346
01:21:44,500 --> 01:21:45,875
wherever those things go.

1347
01:21:52,833 --> 01:21:55,250
Never told anybody else that.

1348
01:21:59,291 --> 01:22:01,166
You think that makes me sound crazy?

1349
01:22:02,416 --> 01:22:03,416
[chuckles softly]

1350
01:22:09,875 --> 01:22:14,000
Yeah. I lost my husband too,
a little over a year ago.

1351
01:22:15,333 --> 01:22:17,333
It took him a long time.

1352
01:22:18,875 --> 01:22:21,125
And when it was over,
it was like there was a...

1353
01:22:21,791 --> 01:22:23,083
a hole in the world.

1354
01:22:24,791 --> 01:22:27,017
I had more questions than answers,

1355
01:22:27,041 --> 01:22:30,333
like no human
had ever died before. [scoffs]

1356
01:22:32,125 --> 01:22:36,708
When you go through something like that,
nothing you do is crazy.

1357
01:22:38,291 --> 01:22:40,684
You just go through what you go through.

1358
01:22:40,708 --> 01:22:41,750
[Robert] Mmm.

1359
01:22:43,791 --> 01:22:46,708
In the forest,
every least thing's important.

1360
01:22:47,375 --> 01:22:49,101
It's all threaded together,

1361
01:22:49,125 --> 01:22:51,809
so you can't tell where one thing ends
and another begins

1362
01:22:51,833 --> 01:22:53,250
if you really look at it.

1363
01:22:56,041 --> 01:22:59,750
The little insects you can't even see,
they play a role as vital as the river.

1364
01:23:00,333 --> 01:23:01,559
[exhales sharply]

1365
01:23:01,583 --> 01:23:04,500
The dead tree is as important
as the living one.

1366
01:23:08,250 --> 01:23:10,875
There must be something
for us to learn from that.

1367
01:23:12,916 --> 01:23:14,833
What if you got nothing left to give?

1368
01:23:16,958 --> 01:23:18,416
Hmm? What then?

1369
01:23:19,166 --> 01:23:20,166
Mmm...

1370
01:23:21,750 --> 01:23:25,166
The world needs a hermit in the woods
as much as a preacher in the pulpit.

1371
01:23:26,166 --> 01:23:27,583
[Robert chuckles]

1372
01:23:28,250 --> 01:23:29,976
[breathing shakily]

1373
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:32,416
[voice breaking] Yeah. Yeah.

1374
01:23:33,791 --> 01:23:34,958
Is that what I am?

1375
01:23:36,750 --> 01:23:37,750
A hermit?

1376
01:23:38,750 --> 01:23:41,708
Well, I mean,
I believe we both are, in our own ways.

1377
01:23:44,833 --> 01:23:47,291
Just waiting to see
what we've been left here for.

1378
01:23:54,958 --> 01:23:56,476

that his daughter had returned.</i>

1398
01:25:05,666 --> 01:25:06,666
Katie?

[girl moaning weakly]

1400
01:25:11,875 --> 01:25:12,958
Kate.

01:25:13,625 --> 01:25:14,625
Katie?

1402
01:25:17,166 --> 01:25:18,333
Oh, Kate.

01:25:41,458 --> 01:25:42,708
Okay.
