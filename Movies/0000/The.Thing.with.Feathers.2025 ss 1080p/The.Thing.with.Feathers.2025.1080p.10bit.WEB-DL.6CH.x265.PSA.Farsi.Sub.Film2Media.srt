And the prize is this.

898
01:01:05,912 --> 01:01:10,584
The best model I will bring
to life for one day.

899
01:01:10,667 --> 01:01:15,422
A real living mother
to tuck you up in bed.

900
01:01:15,505 --> 01:01:17,424
[poignant music]

901
01:01:18,508 --> 01:01:21,261
[deep breath]

902
01:01:45,243 --> 01:01:47,412
[feathers rustling]

903
01:01:49,164 --> 01:01:50,373
No.

904
01:01:51,041 --> 01:01:55,003
No. As you remember her.

905
01:02:13,355 --> 01:02:15,482
[music gently swells]

906
01:02:21,237 --> 01:02:23,990
[fabric being cut]

907
01:02:35,919 --> 01:02:38,421
[fabric cutting]

908
01:02:39,589 --> 01:02:42,133
[markers scratching]

909
01:02:45,053 --> 01:02:47,097
[Crow clears throat] Right.

910
01:02:47,180 --> 01:02:50,684
And stop. Hmm.

911
01:02:50,767 --> 01:02:52,603
They're both excellent.

912
01:02:52,686 --> 01:02:54,938
You've got her smile.

913
01:02:55,730 --> 01:02:57,315
It's uncanny.

914
01:02:59,109 --> 01:03:04,698
And you have captured
her... posture.

915
01:03:04,781 --> 01:03:07,283
-Hah.
-Which one won?

916
01:03:08,326 --> 01:03:10,203
Uh, well...

917
01:03:10,286 --> 01:03:12,456
Which one's gonna be turned
into Mum?

918
01:03:12,539 --> 01:03:13,707
Sorry, what?

919
01:03:13,790 --> 01:03:15,709
-You promised.
-[Crow] Yes.

920
01:03:15,792 --> 01:03:17,836
-Where is she?
-[Crow] But you didn't think...

921
01:03:17,919 --> 01:03:19,171
that she... Where is she?

922
01:03:19,254 --> 01:03:22,465
Where is she,
you bloody old crow?

923
01:03:23,591 --> 01:03:25,343
She's dead.

924
01:03:26,928 --> 01:03:28,847
She can't come back.

925
01:03:28,930 --> 01:03:31,558
That's it, boys,
that's all you've got.

926
01:03:31,641 --> 01:03:33,852
[Dad sobbing]

927
01:03:39,482 --> 01:03:42,152
[sobbing]

928
01:03:43,194 --> 01:03:45,155
[man] How you doing, boys?

929
01:03:45,238 --> 01:03:46,740
Nearly done?

930
01:03:46,823 --> 01:03:49,451
You can go read these
to Dad shortly.

931
01:03:51,119 --> 01:03:54,581
How's he been, your Dad?

932
01:03:54,664 --> 01:03:56,916
I don't know.

933
01:03:56,999 --> 01:04:01,254
And did you keep an emotion
diary the last two weeks?

934
01:04:03,214 --> 01:04:04,466
No.

935
01:04:04,549 --> 01:04:05,592
That... that's okay.

936
01:04:05,675 --> 01:04:09,429
Did you try
the meditation exercises?

937
01:04:10,722 --> 01:04:12,683
-Ohmmmm...
-[psychologist chuckles]

938
01:04:12,766 --> 01:04:13,934
Boys!

939
01:04:14,017 --> 01:04:17,187
No. No, no, it's okay.

940
01:04:17,270 --> 01:04:19,606
It can feel a bit silly
at first.

941
01:04:21,232 --> 01:04:24,110
Is there anything
that you wanna talk about?

942
01:04:24,736 --> 01:04:26,237
Thoughts of Mum?

943
01:04:28,698 --> 01:04:30,534
Right, that's okay.

944
01:04:30,617 --> 01:04:32,119
Maybe we could draw a picture

945
01:04:32,202 --> 01:04:33,954
that shows me how
you're feeling,

946
01:04:34,037 --> 01:04:36,748
and then we can talk about them
afterwards.

947
01:04:36,831 --> 01:04:39,501
Yeah? Sound good?

948
01:04:39,584 --> 01:04:41,127
Cool.

949
01:04:55,850 --> 01:04:58,061
I thought it would get easier.

950
01:05:04,526 --> 01:05:06,236
I... I thought...

951
01:05:06,319 --> 01:05:07,487
Listen, uh...

952
01:05:07,570 --> 01:05:09,865
I think we should
talk about the difference

953
01:05:09,948 --> 01:05:14,035
between grief and despair.

954
01:05:21,417 --> 01:05:22,627
[birds singing]

955
01:05:23,962 --> 01:05:25,589
Gran!

956
01:05:25,672 --> 01:05:27,006
[Gran gasps]

957
01:05:27,799 --> 01:05:30,343
-[Gran] Look at you two.
-Gran!

958
01:05:30,426 --> 01:05:31,386
You're so skinny.

959
01:05:31,469 --> 01:05:33,930
Has your Dad not been
feeding you?

960
01:05:34,013 --> 01:05:35,348
[gate clangs]

961
01:05:35,431 --> 01:05:36,933
Oh. Come on in.

962
01:05:37,600 --> 01:05:39,018
Hello.

963
01:05:39,936 --> 01:05:41,146
-Hi.
-Merry Christmas.

964
01:05:41,229 --> 01:05:43,439
-Merry Christmas.
-Yeah.

965
01:05:44,566 --> 01:05:46,151
Alright, come on.

966
01:05:48,778 --> 01:05:50,030
Makes them on his own,

967
01:05:50,113 --> 01:05:52,949
even without the book outlines.

968
01:05:54,450 --> 01:05:56,119
[dishes clattering]

969
01:05:57,036 --> 01:05:59,164
[clock ticking]

970
01:06:01,166 --> 01:06:03,126
[cutlery scraping]

971
01:06:06,379 --> 01:06:10,049
[clock ticking]

972
01:06:22,145 --> 01:06:23,980
I'll see how they're getting on.

973
01:06:34,490 --> 01:06:36,618
-[choral Christmas music]
-So, how's the comic coming on?

974
01:06:36,701 --> 01:06:39,496
Do I call it a comic,
or a graphic novel?

975
01:06:39,579 --> 01:06:42,207
No, you can call it a comic.
Um...

976
01:06:42,290 --> 01:06:44,501
Yeah, it's... it's alright.
It's interesting.

977
01:06:44,584 --> 01:06:47,671
Dad doesn't like it when people
call them graphic novels.

978
01:06:47,754 --> 01:06:49,506
He says it's wanky.

979
01:06:49,589 --> 01:06:51,174
[Margaret chuckles]

980
01:06:52,717 --> 01:06:54,136
That's what you say.

981
01:06:54,219 --> 01:06:56,596
Well, you wolfed that down, boys.

982
01:06:56,679 --> 01:06:59,432
Did we get you the right ones
this time?

983
01:07:00,642 --> 01:07:02,060
He's like his mum.

984
01:07:03,436 --> 01:07:04,437
If she was doing something,

985
01:07:04,520 --> 01:07:06,689
she'd pretend
she couldn't hear you.

986
01:07:08,191 --> 01:07:10,735
Was that okay?
Potatoes weren't my best.

987
01:07:10,818 --> 01:07:13,446
Oh, delicious.

988
01:07:13,529 --> 01:07:17,617
What was she like?
Our mum when she was young.

989
01:07:17,700 --> 01:07:18,785
Your mum?

990
01:07:19,702 --> 01:07:20,787
Stubborn.

991
01:07:20,870 --> 01:07:22,956
You two have got
a lot of her in you,

992
01:07:23,039 --> 01:07:24,833
in different ways.

993
01:07:24,916 --> 01:07:26,835
How am I like her?

994
01:07:26,918 --> 01:07:28,336
You're funny.

995
01:07:28,419 --> 01:07:32,132
She was very... quick-witted,
wasn't she, Keith?

996
01:07:32,215 --> 01:07:33,592
Yeah, cheeky bugger, more like.

997
01:07:33,675 --> 01:07:35,343
[chuckles]

998
01:07:38,179 --> 01:07:41,349
Oh, no, no, it's alright.
I'll do it. I'll do it.

999
01:07:43,393 --> 01:07:46,104
It was adorable
when she was little.

1000
01:07:46,187 --> 01:07:48,648
But when she was a teenager...

1001
01:07:48,731 --> 01:07:50,275
Oh, my God,

1002
01:07:50,358 --> 01:07:52,485
you couldn't win an argument.

1003
01:07:59,200 --> 01:08:01,328
Go and get the photo album
from next door,

1004
01:08:01,411 --> 01:08:04,664
and I'll show you the first time
she brought your dad back here.

1005
01:08:11,963 --> 01:08:13,715
[chair scrapes]

1006
01:08:26,019 --> 01:08:28,438
[choral music swells]

1007
01:08:34,277 --> 01:08:40,742
[Crow mutters to himself]

1008
01:08:40,825 --> 01:08:41,993
Destroy the Crow!

1009
01:08:42,076 --> 01:08:43,703
Catch and kill.

1010
01:08:43,786 --> 01:08:45,580
Let's get Crow!

1011
01:08:45,663 --> 01:08:48,541
[Crow muttering]

1012
01:08:48,624 --> 01:08:52,420
Shut the gates! Kill him,
and drown him in blood.

1013
01:08:52,503 --> 01:08:55,548
-All crows, shut the gates!
-[Crow muttering]

1014
01:08:55,631 --> 01:08:58,343
If he takes our castle,
we burn it!

1015
01:08:58,426 --> 01:09:01,054
So much of her
when the boys smile,

1016
01:09:01,137 --> 01:09:03,598
it's the same smile. [chuckles]

1017
01:09:03,681 --> 01:09:05,266
[sighs]

1018
01:09:06,517 --> 01:09:08,019
You can take this home with you
if you want.

1019
01:09:08,102 --> 01:09:10,021
-No, that's good. Keep it here.
-No, leave it here, yeah?

1020
01:09:10,104 --> 01:09:12,399
-Keep it here. It's good...
-Well... Let the boys see it?

1021
01:09:12,482 --> 01:09:14,067
Yeah, they should...
they should see it.

1022
01:09:14,150 --> 01:09:15,777
-They should see it.
-Oh.

1023
01:09:15,860 --> 01:09:18,363
Woo-hoo, wiggly-wiggly! Up here!

1024
01:09:18,446 --> 01:09:20,573
[caws]
Kraa, kraa, kraa!

1025
01:09:20,656 --> 01:09:22,909
[Crow] We move on, do we not?
We hurtle, do we not?

1026
01:09:22,992 --> 01:09:26,246
Love drunk. Fox cubs.
Dead meat. Rat-tat-tat.

1027
01:09:26,329 --> 01:09:27,580
Catch and kill!

1028
01:09:27,663 --> 01:09:30,583
-Kill him!
-Come on, he went this way.

1029
01:09:30,666 --> 01:09:31,459
Come on.

1030
01:09:31,542 --> 01:09:33,878
Look at this hat, look. [laughs]

1031
01:09:33,961 --> 01:09:35,422
I think that was my mum's hat.

1032
01:09:35,505 --> 01:09:37,048
I'm just gonna check on them,
actually...

1033
01:09:37,131 --> 01:09:38,800
-Okay, okay.
-See you in a minute.

1034
01:09:38,883 --> 01:09:40,718
Yeah. Alright.

1035
01:09:46,432 --> 01:09:48,351
[choral music swells]

1036
01:09:50,186 --> 01:09:51,938
Boys?

1037
01:10:00,696 --> 01:10:02,198
Boys?

1038
01:10:10,373 --> 01:10:13,585
Boys, what the hell do you
think you're doing, huh?

1039
01:10:13,668 --> 01:10:16,212
I've been looking
for you everywhere.

1040
01:10:17,630 --> 01:10:18,756
You're bleeding.

1041
01:10:20,466 --> 01:10:22,802
What's going on? Huh?

1042
01:10:24,053 --> 01:10:25,221
I'm fine.

1043
01:10:25,304 --> 01:10:28,349
You've got cuts and scratches
all over you.

1044
01:10:30,059 --> 01:10:31,811
What have you been doing to him?

1045
01:10:31,894 --> 01:10:33,313
What have you been doing?

1046
01:10:33,396 --> 01:10:35,899
-It was Crow.
-It wasn't fucking Crow.

1047
01:10:35,982 --> 01:10:37,775
[trees creaking]

1048

[footsteps crunching on leaves]

1051
01:11:14,562 --> 01:11:16,939
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1052
01:11:19,150 --> 01:11:21,652
I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.

1053
01:11:22,612 --> 01:11:24,489
I'm not angry with you.

1054
01:11:30,495 --> 01:11:32,914
I'm so sorry. [crying]

1055
01:11:36,292 --> 01:11:39,295
[sobs] I'm so sorry.

1056
01:11:45,510 --> 01:11:48,471
I miss... I miss...

1057
01:11:49,430 --> 01:11:51,641
I miss Mummy.

1058
01:11:51,724 --> 01:11:53,434
I'm so sorry.

1059
01:11:55,811 --> 01:11:59,482
[Boy] Sometimes we felt like
he was our dad again.

1060
01:12:00,733 --> 01:12:02,402
[car rumbling]

1061
01:12:02,485 --> 01:12:04,529
But it never lasted.

[beep]

1069
01:12:43,192 --> 01:12:44,152
[Paul] I'm gonna start
getting a bit worried

1070
01:12:44,235 --> 01:12:45,778
if you don't pick up the phone.

1071
01:12:45,861 --> 01:12:48,239
We're thinking about you today.

1072
01:12:48,322 --> 01:12:49,741
Give us a call, eh?

1073
01:12:49,824 --> 01:12:52,535
-Hope you're alright.
-[beep]

1074
01:12:52,618 --> 01:12:55,121
[Margaret] I've tried
you a couple of times.

1075
01:12:55,204 --> 01:13:00,001
Today's been tough, and, um,
I'm sure it has for you too.

1076
01:13:00,084 --> 01:13:01,169
Anniversaries are hard,

1077
01:13:01,252 --> 01:13:03,546
-and well...
-[beep]

1078
01:13:10,261 --> 01:13:12,096
-[Boy] Dad?
-Hmm?

1079
01:13:12,179 --> 01:13:14,140
Are you gonna read us a story?

1080
01:13:14,223 --> 01:13:15,517
No, it's too late.

1081
01:13:15,600 --> 01:13:17,977
-Please.
-I said no.

1082
01:13:18,060 --> 01:13:19,979
No bedtime stories tonight.

1083
01:13:23,149 --> 01:13:24,984
[Crow] Shame on you.

1084
01:13:25,067 --> 01:13:27,403
[sinister music]

1085
01:13:38,247 --> 01:13:40,999
[Crow]
Does Daddy need a cuddle?

1086
01:13:42,293 --> 01:13:47,549
Once upon a time there was
a king who had two sons.

1087
01:13:47,632 --> 01:13:51,844
One day his queen
dropped down dead.

1088
01:13:51,927 --> 01:13:53,471
[Dad] Fuck off!

1089
01:13:54,597 --> 01:13:56,975
[Crow] And so, the king
allowed his kingdom

1090
01:13:57,058 --> 01:13:59,727
to go to ruin...

1091
01:13:59,810 --> 01:14:03,565
and abandoned his two sons,

1092
01:14:03,648 --> 01:14:08,110
so he could wallow in self-pity.

1093
01:14:08,486 --> 01:14:10,113
[grunting]

1094
01:14:10,196 --> 01:14:11,822
[yells]

1095
01:14:14,950 --> 01:14:16,035
Out. Get out.

1096
01:14:16,118 --> 01:14:19,956
[struggling, thumping]

1097
01:14:20,039 --> 01:14:21,582
No more.

1098
01:14:22,458 --> 01:14:24,043
No more.

1099
01:14:24,126 --> 01:14:25,920
You have to go.

1100
01:14:28,798 --> 01:14:30,550
[Crow] Are you sure about that?

1101
01:14:30,633 --> 01:14:34,011
Yes, yes. Fuck, yes!

1102
01:14:37,973 --> 01:14:41,185
[Crow] Let's see what happens
without me.

1103
01:14:41,977 --> 01:14:43,979
[rain pattering]

1104
01:14:50,653 --> 01:14:52,530
[doorbell buzzes]

1105
01:14:57,201 --> 01:14:58,870
[tense music]

1106
01:14:58,953 --> 01:15:01,747
[doorbell buzzes persistently]

1107
01:15:08,587 --> 01:15:11,257
[doorbell buzzes]

1108
01:15:24,770 --> 01:15:27,815
[doorbell buzzes]

1109
01:15:28,274 --> 01:15:29,859
Dad?

1110
01:15:31,402 --> 01:15:33,070
Who is it?

1111
01:15:35,322 --> 01:15:36,991
Simon Coleridge.

1112
01:15:37,491 --> 01:15:39,243
From number 56.

1113
01:15:42,872 --> 01:15:44,791
How can I help you, Simon?

1114
01:15:44,874 --> 01:15:46,793
I know we don't know each other.

1115
01:15:46,876 --> 01:15:49,712
I wondered if I could
borrow some milk.

1116
01:15:55,176 --> 01:15:59,889
Oh, I'm afraid we've...
we've run out of milk.

1117
01:15:59,972 --> 01:16:02,850
I'm sure the shop on the corner
will still be open.

1118
01:16:03,517 --> 01:16:05,853
[eerie breathing]

1119
01:16:08,230 --> 01:16:11,275
[Crow] There is no number 56.

1120
01:16:14,069 --> 01:16:15,697
Now, boys...

1121
01:16:15,780 --> 01:16:20,326
Daddy can't tell you a story
tonight, but I can.

1122
01:16:20,409 --> 01:16:21,452
[ominous music]

1123
01:16:21,535 --> 01:16:23,788
Once upon a time
there was a demon,

1124
01:16:23,871 --> 01:16:29,127
a terrible demon
who fed on despair.

1125
01:16:29,210 --> 01:16:30,545
A demon who would hunt

1126
01:16:30,628 --> 01:16:33,089
every inch of the Earth
for the saddest,

1127
01:16:33,172 --> 01:16:36,759
most delicious person
he could find.

1128
01:16:37,426 --> 01:16:39,178
[thunder rumbles]

1129
01:16:39,261 --> 01:16:42,014
-He's a very clever demon...
-[doorbell buzzes]

1130
01:16:42,097 --> 01:16:43,682
...boys.

1131
01:16:45,392 --> 01:16:46,519
Very cunning.

1132
01:16:46,602 --> 01:16:48,771
[doorbell buzzes]

1133
01:16:49,438 --> 01:16:50,898
Who is it?

1134
01:16:51,690 --> 01:16:54,276
It's Dan. From Parenthesis.

1135
01:16:55,361 --> 01:16:57,613
-Dan?
-Yeah.

1136
01:16:58,489 --> 01:16:59,699
From Parenthesis?

1137
01:16:59,782 --> 01:17:02,326
[man] Can I come in?
It's pissing down.

1138
01:17:02,409 --> 01:17:03,661
I've worked there for years,

1139
01:17:03,744 --> 01:17:07,623
and I... I've never heard
of anyone called Dan.

1140
01:17:08,541 --> 01:17:11,961
What's your last name... Dan?

1141
01:17:14,255 --> 01:17:15,673
[Dan] Graves.

1142
01:17:16,799 --> 01:17:19,176
I'm new there.
They put me on your book.

1143
01:17:20,344 --> 01:17:22,012
Thought I'd say hello.

1144
01:17:26,308 --> 01:17:28,185
[whispers] I can't let you in.

1145
01:17:29,353 --> 01:17:31,272
[Dan] I've come all this way.

1146
01:17:31,355 --> 01:17:33,315
No, you're gonna have to leave.

1147
01:17:34,984 --> 01:17:36,986
[Dan] Can I at least
use your lav?

1148
01:17:37,820 --> 01:17:41,240
[loud thumping on door]

1149
01:17:41,323 --> 01:17:43,242
[Crow] Now, boys.

1150
01:17:43,325 --> 01:17:45,912
This demon can only feast

1151
01:17:45,995 --> 01:17:50,416
if those in despair allow it.

1152
01:17:50,499 --> 01:17:53,753
So, who do you think
he's coming for tonight?

1153
01:17:53,836 --> 01:17:57,173
Who do we know... that's sad?

1154
01:17:57,256 --> 01:18:00,843
[loud thumping on door]

1155
01:18:00,926 --> 01:18:03,095
[man] Open the door.

1156
01:18:03,178 --> 01:18:04,597
It's the police.

1157
01:18:04,680 --> 01:18:07,016
I'm gonna give you to the count
of five and I'm coming in.

1158
01:18:07,099 --> 01:18:09,393
-One, two...
-[boy] What's going on?

1159
01:18:09,476 --> 01:18:12,021
-Go back upstairs to your room.
-[officer] Three...

1160
01:18:12,104 --> 01:18:13,439
What's going on?

1161
01:18:13,522 --> 01:18:15,107
-Four...
-Go upstairs.

1162
01:18:15,190 --> 01:18:16,234
-Five...
-Now!

1163
01:18:16,317 --> 01:18:18,360
[banging on door]

1164
01:18:19,945 --> 01:18:23,074
[man]
Okay, have it your way.

1165
01:18:23,157 --> 01:18:26,869
There's someone here
who wants to speak to you.

1166
01:18:28,662 --> 01:18:31,040
[tense music continues]

1167
01:18:42,468 --> 01:18:44,219
[music intensifies]

1168
01:18:46,138 --> 01:18:47,306
[whispers] Mum?

1169
01:18:47,848 --> 01:18:49,391
[Mum] It's me.

1170
01:18:52,853 --> 01:18:55,147
[music fades]

1171
01:18:55,230 --> 01:18:56,440
I'm back.

1172
01:19:02,404 --> 01:19:03,739
Open the door.

1173
01:19:04,531 --> 01:19:05,950
No.

1174
01:19:06,700 --> 01:19:08,243
Open up.

1175
01:19:11,455 --> 01:19:12,915
[Mum] Let me in.

1176
01:19:15,125 --> 01:19:17,503
-Are the boys there?
-Mum!

1177
01:19:17,586 --> 01:19:19,171
No.

1178
01:19:19,254 --> 01:19:20,506
No, boys, no...

1179
01:19:20,589 --> 01:19:22,174
-Don't, don't...
-Mum! Mum!

1180
01:19:22,257 --> 01:19:23,759
-Please stop, please.
-Mum, Mum!

1181
01:19:23,842 --> 01:19:26,053
-Please, it's not Mummy.
-Mum!

1182
01:19:26,136 --> 01:19:28,931
-Don't. Don't. Don't!
-Mum!

1183
01:19:29,848 --> 01:19:32,267
[Mum] I've missed you all
so much.

1184
01:19:35,604 --> 01:19:37,690
[Mum] Come on, open up.

1185
01:19:37,773 --> 01:19:40,025
[deep breath]

1186
01:19:41,485 --> 01:19:43,153
[Mum] Open the door.

1187
01:19:54,331 --> 01:19:55,791
[Mum] Come on.

1188
01:19:55,874 --> 01:19:57,418
[lock opens]

1189
01:19:57,501 --> 01:19:58,753
[boys] Dad.

1190
01:19:58,836 --> 01:20:01,005
-[Crow] Let him go, boy.
-[Boy] Dad!

1191
01:20:01,088 --> 01:20:02,715
[Crow] Let him go.

Boys, could you come into
the living room, please.

1211
01:20:57,686 --> 01:20:59,105
I need to talk to you.

1212
01:20:59,188 --> 01:21:02,357
What do you think your
mother would have said, hmm?
