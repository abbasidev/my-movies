1
00:02:57,605 --> 00:02:59,409
There you go.

2
00:03:01,607 --> 00:03:04,810
There. You were hungry.

3
00:03:23,295 --> 00:03:25,463
That's it.

4
00:04:16,349 --> 00:04:17,950
Repeat.

5
00:04:46,447 --> 00:04:48,280
Good day, sir.

6
00:04:48,415 --> 00:04:49,647
Good day to you.

7
00:04:49,782 --> 00:04:52,750
What brings you to Hewlands?

8
00:04:52,885 --> 00:04:54,451
I'm tutoring the boys here.

9
00:04:54,586 --> 00:04:56,588
The Latin tutor.

10
00:04:56,724 --> 00:04:58,990
I've heard of you.

11
00:05:04,996 --> 00:05:07,306
What brought you
into the garden?

12
00:05:09,339 --> 00:05:12,003
Uh...

13
00:05:12,138 --> 00:05:14,339
It's just a question,
master tutor.

14
00:05:14,475 --> 00:05:16,172
Yes, I, uh...

15
00:05:17,617 --> 00:05:20,810
I suppose the air was fresh
out here, and...

16
00:05:20,946 --> 00:05:24,222
uh, I saw you with your bird.

17
00:05:24,358 --> 00:05:26,655
- It's a hawk.
-  Ah.

18
00:05:29,092 --> 00:05:30,659
May I?

19
00:05:44,474 --> 00:05:46,642
Don't get too close.

20
00:05:47,510 --> 00:05:49,381
He doesn't know you.

21
00:05:55,650 --> 00:05:57,048
Oh.

22
00:05:58,183 --> 00:06:00,524
Hello, boy.

23
00:06:05,966 --> 00:06:09,159
Ah.

24
00:06:09,995 --> 00:06:12,294
He likes you.

25
00:06:15,305 --> 00:06:17,134
What is your name?

26
00:06:18,805 --> 00:06:20,306
I shan't tell you.

27
00:06:23,048 --> 00:06:24,878
You shall.

28
00:06:28,780 --> 00:06:30,254
I shan't.

29
00:06:30,389 --> 00:06:32,655
- You shall.
- I won't.

30
00:06:35,658 --> 00:06:37,891
You'll tell me when we kiss.

31
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:58,912
What are you doing?

32
00:07:17,035 --> 00:07:18,267
Agnes.

33
00:07:21,371 --> 00:07:23,398
My name is Agnes.

34
00:07:24,573 --> 00:07:26,610
Where are you from?

35
00:07:30,612 --> 00:07:32,775
Have I said something?

36
00:07:32,910 --> 00:07:34,477
- Huh?
- No.

37
00:07:35,547 --> 00:07:37,715
- You don't know who I am.
- Wait, I wish to see...

38
00:07:37,851 --> 00:07:39,790
You can't see me again.

39
00:07:39,926 --> 00:07:41,493
Oh.

40
00:07:47,926 --> 00:07:50,061
Where have you been?

41
00:07:50,197 --> 00:07:51,597
I was in the field
helping Bartholomew.

42
00:07:51,733 --> 00:07:53,237
A newborn lamb is unwell.

43
00:07:53,372 --> 00:07:55,501
Well, I... I went to the field.

44
00:07:55,637 --> 00:07:57,267
I did not see you there.

45
00:07:57,402 --> 00:08:01,275
Well, I was there.
Tell her, Bartholomew.

46
00:08:01,411 --> 00:08:02,778
She was there.

47
00:08:02,913 --> 00:08:04,940
Have you seen
the new Latin tutor?

48
00:08:05,075 --> 00:08:06,584
The glover's son.

49
00:08:06,719 --> 00:08:09,310
The boys said he just ran out,
never returned.

50
00:08:09,446 --> 00:08:10,816
He was supposed
to give them lessons

51
00:08:10,951 --> 00:08:12,849
to pay off his father's debts.

52
00:08:12,985 --> 00:08:14,083
I haven't seen him.

53
00:08:14,218 --> 00:08:15,854
Well, should've known better.

54
00:08:15,990 --> 00:08:18,160
Like father, like son.

55
00:08:22,336 --> 00:08:23,962
You know, I do believe you are

56
00:08:24,097 --> 00:08:25,337
the prettiest girls
in the parish.

57
00:08:25,472 --> 00:08:26,868
-We are.
-One day,

58
00:08:27,003 --> 00:08:28,463
I shall have my wits about me

59
00:08:28,598 --> 00:08:30,467
for all the suitors
that will come for you.

60
00:08:30,603 --> 00:08:33,008
Agnes is the eldest.
She'll marry first.

61
00:08:33,144 --> 00:08:35,639
She will not if she keeps
running off to the forest

62
00:08:35,775 --> 00:08:37,646
like a gypsy.

63
00:09:07,709 --> 00:09:08,742
Where have you been?

64
00:09:08,877 --> 00:09:10,510
We were expecting you
hours ago.

65
00:09:10,646 --> 00:09:11,741
- I was...
- Well?

66
00:09:11,877 --> 00:09:12,841
I was working.

67
00:09:12,976 --> 00:09:15,378
Sit. Sit.

68
00:09:17,291 --> 00:09:19,250
Your supper's near cold.

69
00:09:20,691 --> 00:09:22,017
- Uh, boys, boys!
- Hey. -Stop.

70
00:09:22,153 --> 00:09:24,086
There's enough for all.

71
00:09:24,221 --> 00:09:25,989
How go the lessons at Hewlands?

72
00:09:26,124 --> 00:09:27,732
Those boys are no scholars.

73
00:09:27,867 --> 00:09:29,933
I wonder at the notion
of all that learning. -Hmm.

74
00:09:30,068 --> 00:09:32,736
Latin for boys who will be
naught but sheep farmers.

75
00:09:32,871 --> 00:09:35,000
- It is the putting on of airs.
- No, no, no!

76
00:09:35,136 --> 00:09:36,700
- That will do!
- All right, Gilbert.

77
00:09:38,670 --> 00:09:41,613
You heard your mother.
There's enough for all.

78
00:09:43,574 --> 00:09:46,140
You speak ill of the boys
at Hewlands.

79
00:09:46,276 --> 00:09:48,147
"They're no scholars."

80
00:09:49,147 --> 00:09:50,678
But I tell you something,

81
00:09:50,813 --> 00:09:52,151
they'll ever be more of a man
than you are.

82
00:09:52,286 --> 00:09:54,790
They are put to honest work,
unlike you.

83
00:09:54,925 --> 00:09:58,630
Useless, tradeless,
your fancy airs.

84
00:09:59,596 --> 00:10:00,960
All that education,

85
00:10:01,095 --> 00:10:03,327
not an ounce of sense.

86
00:10:04,328 --> 00:10:05,735
I'm tutoring those boys to pay

87
00:10:05,870 --> 00:10:07,972
your debts to that family,
am I not?

88
00:10:08,108 --> 00:10:11,407
Your immeasurable
amount of debt to that family.

89
00:10:11,543 --> 00:10:13,711
- I'm not...
- Stop!

90
00:10:17,875 --> 00:10:20,751
What of the rest of the family
at Hewlands? Have you met them?

91
00:10:21,748 --> 00:10:22,883
The mother only.

92
00:10:23,018 --> 00:10:24,921
- Not the eldest daughter?
- No.

93
00:10:25,057 --> 00:10:30,620
It is said the girl is
the child of a forest witch.

94
00:10:30,756 --> 00:10:33,263
I've seen her,
wandering the back roads alone

95
00:10:33,399 --> 00:10:35,122
with a hawk on her arm.

96
00:10:35,258 --> 00:10:37,091
A hawk at Hewlands?

97
00:10:37,226 --> 00:10:39,003
Yes.

98
00:10:39,139 --> 00:10:41,836
They say she takes him to the
forest with her unaccompanied.

99
00:10:41,972 --> 00:10:44,172
Yeah, but are you certain,
Eliza?

100
00:10:44,308 --> 00:10:47,641
The eldest daughter keeps
a hawk, not a servant girl?

101
00:10:47,777 --> 00:10:49,846
Yes. Yeah.

102
00:11:16,736 --> 00:11:17,808
Agnes.

103
00:11:22,445 --> 00:11:23,847
Hello.

104
00:11:24,846 --> 00:11:26,547
What are you doing here?

105
00:11:26,682 --> 00:11:28,379
Brought you this.

106
00:11:29,849 --> 00:11:31,112
What is it?

107
00:11:31,247 --> 00:11:32,886
It's, uh...

108
00:11:33,021 --> 00:11:35,155
it's a new glove for your bird.

109
00:11:36,625 --> 00:11:38,224
I have a glove.

110
00:11:44,962 --> 00:11:45,994
Agnes.

111
00:11:47,702 --> 00:11:49,400
Agnes, wait.

112
00:11:54,513 --> 00:11:56,004
I know who you are.

113
00:11:56,139 --> 00:11:57,873
Who am I?

114
00:11:58,008 --> 00:12:00,112
Well, I... I don't know you,
but I've heard things...

115
00:12:00,248 --> 00:12:01,919
I'm the daughter
of a forest witch?

116
00:12:02,054 --> 00:12:03,686
Yes. People say that,
but I-I don't care...

117
00:12:03,821 --> 00:12:06,349
I am my mother's daughter.

118
00:12:06,485 --> 00:12:08,760
I've learnt many things
from her.

119
00:12:11,728 --> 00:12:12,890
What are you looking at?

120
00:12:13,026 --> 00:12:14,260
- You.
- Why?

121
00:12:20,732 --> 00:12:23,601
I... -I thought you were a man
of words, master tutor.

122
00:12:23,737 --> 00:12:25,741
Yes.

123
00:12:25,876 --> 00:12:27,604
Are you not?

124
00:12:27,739 --> 00:12:31,145
Speaking with people is
sometimes difficult for me.

125
00:12:32,508 --> 00:12:34,786
Well, tell me a story, then.

126
00:12:35,753 --> 00:12:37,822
- A story?
- Yes.

127
00:12:40,186 --> 00:12:42,453
What story would you like?

128
00:12:49,899 --> 00:12:52,298
Something that moves you.

129
00:12:55,935 --> 00:12:57,567
All right.

130
00:12:59,308 --> 00:13:02,506
Do you know the story
of Orpheus and Eurydice?

131
00:13:05,508 --> 00:13:09,084
Orpheus is a man of music.

132
00:13:10,084 --> 00:13:12,485
He has this exquisite voice.

133
00:13:13,421 --> 00:13:16,492
His playing of the kithara,
which is a...

134
00:13:16,628 --> 00:13:18,262
is-is a harp-like lyre,

135
00:13:18,398 --> 00:13:21,595
is so divine,

136
00:13:21,731 --> 00:13:24,594
birds, the...

137
00:13:24,729 --> 00:13:27,134
the beasts, e-even the stones
and the trees,

138
00:13:27,270 --> 00:13:32,109
they all moved
to the rhythm of his music.

139
00:13:32,245 --> 00:13:37,140
Now, Orpheus falls in love with
this beautiful nymph, Eurydice.

140
00:13:37,276 --> 00:13:40,178
Soon after their marriage,

141
00:13:40,313 --> 00:13:42,017
Eurydice's bitten by a viper

142
00:13:42,152 --> 00:13:45,016
and poison courses
through her body,

143
00:13:45,151 --> 00:13:46,653
and she's killed.

144
00:13:48,826 --> 00:13:51,357
And Orpheus, filled with grief,

145
00:13:51,493 --> 00:13:54,525
journeys to the underworld
to take her back.

146
00:13:55,694 --> 00:13:59,935
He charms this
three-headed dog, Cerberus.

147
00:14:00,071 --> 00:14:03,798
He beguiles Hades
until finally...

148
00:14:04,967 --> 00:14:06,876
...he's allowed to take
his love back with him

149
00:14:07,012 --> 00:14:09,540
to the world
of the living but...

150
00:14:11,342 --> 00:14:12,712
...under one condition.

151
00:14:12,847 --> 00:14:14,611
What is it?

152
00:14:15,754 --> 00:14:17,185
She must follow behind him,

153
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:20,254
and he must not turn around
to look at her.

154
00:14:23,587 --> 00:14:27,328
Now, as they begin
their ascent,

155
00:14:27,464 --> 00:14:31,199
Orpheus can't hear
her footsteps, so he listens...

156
00:14:32,896 --> 00:14:36,998
...and listens and listens
and listens.

157
00:14:38,837 --> 00:14:42,771
But all he can hear is
the sound of his heartbeat.

158
00:14:49,688 --> 00:14:51,890
And the rest is silence.

159
00:14:55,822 --> 00:14:59,293
And as he approaches
the gates of the underworld...

160
00:15:03,829 --> 00:15:05,629
...he can't contain himself
any longer.

161
00:15:05,764 --> 00:15:08,907
He turns around to look at her,
and she is...

162
00:15:10,669 --> 00:15:12,977
...trapped in the underworld
forever.

163
00:15:27,385 --> 00:15:29,087
Hmm.

164
00:15:29,222 --> 00:15:30,955
That was a good story.

165
00:15:31,090 --> 00:15:32,931
Did you like it?

166
00:15:37,468 --> 00:15:40,429
Remember, mugwort,
what you brought to pass,

167
00:15:40,565 --> 00:15:42,798
what you readied at Regenmeld.

168
00:15:42,933 --> 00:15:47,040
You're called Una,
the most ancient plant.

169
00:15:47,175 --> 00:15:49,803
You defy three, you defy 30,

170
00:15:49,939 --> 00:15:51,939
you defy venom,
you defy air illness,

171
00:15:52,074 --> 00:15:54,609
you defy the horror
that stalks the land.

172
00:15:54,744 --> 00:15:57,615
And you, waybread,
plant mother,

173
00:15:57,750 --> 00:16:00,420
you're open to the east
yet mighty within.

174
00:16:00,555 --> 00:16:04,919
Carts creeped over you,
women rode over you.

175
00:16:05,054 --> 00:16:07,792
You withstood it all,
and you pushed back.

176
00:16:07,928 --> 00:16:11,162
Is it true that you
know everything about a person

177
00:16:11,297 --> 00:16:13,296
by touching them here?

178
00:16:13,431 --> 00:16:14,797
Not everything.

179
00:16:14,933 --> 00:16:16,936
When you touched me here,
what did you see?

180
00:16:17,071 --> 00:16:18,634
I saw a landscape.

181
00:16:18,769 --> 00:16:20,902
- You saw a landscape?
- Mm-hmm.

182
00:16:22,741 --> 00:16:27,816
<i>Spaces, caves, cliff tops,</i>

183
00:16:27,952 --> 00:16:31,349
<i>tunnels and oceans,</i>

184
00:16:31,484 --> 00:16:34,822
<i>this deep, dark, black void,</i>

185
00:16:34,958 --> 00:16:37,853
undiscovered countries.

186
00:17:03,022 --> 00:17:05,188
She speaks...

187
00:17:07,188 --> 00:17:09,589
She speaks, she speaks.

188
00:17:10,325 --> 00:17:11,689
But, soft,

189
00:17:11,824 --> 00:17:15,066
what light through
yonder window breaks?

190
00:17:16,828 --> 00:17:22,139
It is the east,
and Juliet is the sun.

191
00:17:22,972 --> 00:17:26,407
...and kill...

192
00:17:30,574 --> 00:17:33,414
...the envious moon.

193
00:17:49,692 --> 00:17:51,168
Hello.

194
00:17:52,002 --> 00:17:52,999
Hello.

195
00:18:07,887 --> 00:18:10,087
I wish to be handfasted to you.

196
00:18:10,222 --> 00:18:13,085
No, I... I must be
handfasted to you.

197
00:18:13,221 --> 00:18:14,753
No one else will do.

198
00:18:14,888 --> 00:18:16,721
I-I will speak with your
stepmother and your brother,

199
00:18:16,856 --> 00:18:19,090
and of course
they will not agree, but...

200
00:18:21,193 --> 00:18:24,597
I don't care because
I have no talent for waiting.

201
00:18:26,773 --> 00:18:29,439
I cannot abide waiting.

202
00:18:30,309 --> 00:18:31,501
What about your parents?

203
00:18:31,637 --> 00:18:33,435
Your parents will never agree.

204
00:18:35,340 --> 00:18:36,939
Follow me.

205
00:19:21,784 --> 00:19:24,320
Wait. Wait. W-Wait.

206
00:19:35,973 --> 00:19:37,437
- No!
- No!

207
00:19:48,053 --> 00:19:49,517
<i>My glove.</i>

208
00:19:51,181 --> 00:19:54,291
- This is my mother's glove.
- Hmm.

209
00:19:55,027 --> 00:19:57,558
She came out of the woods...

210
00:19:58,821 --> 00:20:00,821
<i>...like her mother</i>

211
00:20:00,957 --> 00:20:03,234
<i>and her mother before her.</i>

212
00:20:08,967 --> 00:20:13,075
<i>The women in my family
see things...</i>

213
00:20:13,211 --> 00:20:15,070
<i>...that others don't.</i>

214
00:20:17,543 --> 00:20:19,008
Agnes.

215
00:20:23,653 --> 00:20:25,247
ROWAN and YOUNG AGNES:
Remember, mugwort,

216
00:20:25,383 --> 00:20:28,523
what you brought to pass,
what you readied at Regenmeld.

217
00:20:28,658 --> 00:20:31,687
You're called Una,
the most ancient plant.

218
00:20:31,822 --> 00:20:33,427
You defy three, you defy 30,

219
00:20:33,563 --> 00:20:35,629
you defy venom,
you defy air illness,

220
00:20:35,764 --> 00:20:38,434
you defy the horror
that stalks the land.

221
00:20:39,371 --> 00:20:41,503
Bartholomew, it will heal.

222
00:20:42,535 --> 00:20:43,733
Will it make a scar?

223
00:20:43,868 --> 00:20:46,972
It may. That's no bad thing.

224
00:20:47,108 --> 00:20:48,708
Listen.

225
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:51,909
Do you hear that?

226
00:20:54,751 --> 00:20:58,256
You must pay attention
to your dreams, Agnes.

227
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:01,450
They will always guide you.

228
00:21:24,413 --> 00:21:26,548
- Good day.
- Good day.

229
00:21:27,544 --> 00:21:29,111
Yes.

230
00:21:44,136 --> 00:21:46,496
Agnes, what's, uh...

231
00:21:46,631 --> 00:21:48,439
what's happened?

232
00:21:48,574 --> 00:21:51,975
Her mother has banished her
from their house.

233
00:21:52,111 --> 00:21:53,543
She's not my mother.

234
00:21:53,678 --> 00:21:56,539
The house belongs
to my brother, Bartholomew.

235
00:21:56,674 --> 00:21:58,811
I chose to leave.

236
00:21:59,813 --> 00:22:01,178
She's with child.

237
00:22:01,314 --> 00:22:02,512
Oh.

238
00:22:02,647 --> 00:22:04,282
Says it's yours.

239
00:22:06,158 --> 00:22:08,624
- Is it? Yours?
- Uh...

240
00:22:09,627 --> 00:22:12,286
The child in her belly,
did you put it there?

241
00:22:13,931 --> 00:22:15,632
I did.

242
00:22:16,735 --> 00:22:18,293
- We are handfasted, Mother.
- We will never allow it!

243
00:22:18,429 --> 00:22:20,031
- There is no sin in it.
- I'm afraid you will need

244
00:22:20,166 --> 00:22:22,340
- our consent, and we will...
- There is no sin in it!

245
00:22:22,475 --> 00:22:25,035
- ...we will never
give it, ever!
- All right!

246
00:22:26,944 --> 00:22:28,336
What?

247
00:22:29,139 --> 00:22:31,382
- You've been bewitched.
- No.

248
00:22:35,985 --> 00:22:40,055
I'd rather you went to sea
than marry this wench.

249
00:22:40,191 --> 00:22:41,590
Mary.

250
00:22:42,492 --> 00:22:44,461
There's no need for that.

251
00:22:44,596 --> 00:22:47,957
I have no doubt
we can come to an arrangement.

252
00:22:48,093 --> 00:22:50,401
-John.
-Hush, woman.

253
00:22:52,237 --> 00:22:54,228
I am certain you are eager

254
00:22:54,363 --> 00:22:56,903
to see your sister
before the altar.

255
00:22:58,039 --> 00:23:00,143
I'm certain you'd rather not
see your boy

256
00:23:00,278 --> 00:23:01,708
dragged before the bawdy court.

257
00:23:01,843 --> 00:23:04,081
There's no need for that.

258
00:23:04,217 --> 00:23:06,681
They said they are handfasted.

259
00:23:08,086 --> 00:23:09,881
Only if I say so.

260
00:23:10,016 --> 00:23:12,185
<i>But why marry
a pasty-faced scholar?</i>

261
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:14,022
What use is he?

262
00:23:15,191 --> 00:23:20,024
He's got more inside of him
than any man I've ever met.

263
00:23:22,167 --> 00:23:24,402
Everything will change.

264
00:23:25,368 --> 00:23:27,565
You. You will change.

265
00:23:27,701 --> 00:23:28,929
I'm already changing.

266
00:23:29,065 --> 00:23:31,534
It's too quiet in there.

267
00:23:31,669 --> 00:23:33,503
In where?

268
00:23:33,638 --> 00:23:35,602
That house.

269
00:23:35,738 --> 00:23:39,644
What would our mother say to us
if we were afraid or uncertain?

270
00:23:39,780 --> 00:23:42,717
To live with our hearts open.

271
00:23:44,523 --> 00:23:47,717
To shut it not in the dark

272
00:23:47,853 --> 00:23:49,717
but to turn it to the sun.

273
00:23:51,554 --> 00:23:55,829
He loves me for what I am,
not what I ought to be.

274
00:23:57,566 --> 00:23:59,734
Then marry him you shall.

275
00:24:04,603 --> 00:24:05,773
Thank you.

276
00:24:06,937 --> 00:24:08,472
Remember, mugwort...

277
00:24:10,139 --> 00:24:11,906
Say it with me. Say it with me.

278
00:24:12,042 --> 00:24:13,847
What you brought to pass,

279
00:24:13,982 --> 00:24:16,619
what you readied at Regenmeld.

280
00:24:16,754 --> 00:24:20,814
You are called Una,
the most ancient plant.

281
00:24:22,957 --> 00:24:27,694
You defy three, you defy 30,

282
00:24:27,830 --> 00:24:32,426
you defy venom,
you defy air illness,

283
00:24:32,561 --> 00:24:35,565
you defy the horror
that stalks the land.

284
00:25:02,199 --> 00:25:04,128
Look at me.

285
00:25:04,993 --> 00:25:06,603
Look at me.

286
00:27:24,476 --> 00:27:26,171
Agnes.

287
00:28:02,675 --> 00:28:04,004
Ah.

288
00:28:12,454 --> 00:28:14,054
Oh.

289
00:28:20,022 --> 00:28:21,655
Oh.

290
00:29:16,188 --> 00:29:17,544
Hey.

291
00:29:19,756 --> 00:29:21,715
Look at that. Look at the fire.

292
00:29:21,851 --> 00:29:24,120
Mmm, what's that?

293
00:29:24,255 --> 00:29:26,220
The doggy dragged something in.

294
00:29:26,355 --> 00:29:28,057
There's something.

295
00:29:28,193 --> 00:29:30,625
Oh.

296
00:29:31,898 --> 00:29:33,433
Daddy's coming.

297
00:29:33,568 --> 00:29:34,769
Hello.

298
00:29:57,423 --> 00:30:00,461
Stitches need to be smaller.

299
00:30:00,596 --> 00:30:02,833
M-Much smaller.

300
00:30:04,302 --> 00:30:05,594
Yes.

301
00:30:10,132 --> 00:30:11,534
Hmm.

302
00:30:12,508 --> 00:30:14,108
Useless.

303
00:30:18,306 --> 00:30:20,941
Okay, and now...

304
00:30:21,077 --> 00:30:22,479
smaller.

305
00:30:23,956 --> 00:30:26,048
- Where are you going?
- I'm going.

306
00:30:26,183 --> 00:30:28,155
Get back to work.

307
00:30:41,601 --> 00:30:43,197
That was the last time
you will ever hit me.

308
00:30:43,332 --> 00:30:44,839
Do you understand?

309
00:30:44,974 --> 00:30:47,207
- Do you understand?!
- Yes.

310
00:31:10,167 --> 00:31:12,430
My love, you should
come back to bed.

311
00:31:19,710 --> 00:31:20,838
What are you writing?

312
00:31:20,973 --> 00:31:22,710
Nothing of note.

313
00:31:22,846 --> 00:31:24,337
It's never nothing.

314
00:31:24,472 --> 00:31:25,949
I don't know.

315
00:31:26,084 --> 00:31:29,447
Perhaps when it's finished,
it will...

316
00:31:31,317 --> 00:31:33,189
Perhaps when it's finished.

317
00:31:33,324 --> 00:31:34,722
Why don't you read me
what you've written?

318
00:31:34,858 --> 00:31:36,383
A-Agnes, it's not--

319
00:31:36,519 --> 00:31:37,822
It-It's not finished.

320
00:31:40,666 --> 00:31:42,900
It's not finished.

321
00:31:52,704 --> 00:31:55,235
Stop it. You'll wake the baby.

322
00:31:57,274 --> 00:31:58,407
It's okay.

323
00:31:58,542 --> 00:32:00,808
No.

324
00:32:06,382 --> 00:32:07,589
I'm sorry.

325
00:32:12,262 --> 00:32:14,160
I've had too much, uh...

326
00:32:14,296 --> 00:32:17,128
Agnes, I've had
too much to drink.

327
00:32:20,066 --> 00:32:21,631
I've had...

328
00:32:24,506 --> 00:32:26,944
I've had too much to drink.

329
00:32:35,719 --> 00:32:37,482
Hey.

330
00:32:38,956 --> 00:32:41,585
What is it?

331
00:32:42,792 --> 00:32:44,322
Give me your hand.

332
00:32:44,458 --> 00:32:46,487
Pl-Pl-Please, please,
please, please,

333
00:32:46,622 --> 00:32:48,163
please, please, please, please.

334
00:32:48,298 --> 00:32:49,966
- What are you afraid
I will see?
- Please stop.

335
00:32:50,102 --> 00:32:51,967
That I am a violent
and dangerous man.

336
00:32:52,103 --> 00:32:53,797
No, you are
none of those things.

337
00:32:53,933 --> 00:32:55,797
- How do you know?
- You're a good man. You're a...

338
00:32:57,107 --> 00:32:59,372
You are a good man.

339
00:33:00,569 --> 00:33:02,804
You're a good man.

340
00:33:06,778 --> 00:33:09,316
Is it that you wish
that we never wed?

341
00:33:10,990 --> 00:33:14,691
How could you say such a thing?

342
00:33:14,826 --> 00:33:17,159
How could you say such a thing?

343
00:33:21,265 --> 00:33:24,534
You and Susanna are
all that I live for.

344
00:33:24,670 --> 00:33:26,298
All that I live for.

345
00:33:26,433 --> 00:33:28,698
What is it, then?

346
00:33:33,671 --> 00:33:35,476
- Here. Look at me.
- Just stop!

347
00:33:35,612 --> 00:33:38,210
Stop, stop. Please, please,
please, please, please, please.

348
00:33:38,345 --> 00:33:39,879
Look at me.

349
00:33:40,015 --> 00:33:42,646
Listen. Listen. Listen.

350
00:33:49,190 --> 00:33:51,424
I'm lost.

351
00:33:54,633 --> 00:33:56,798
I've lost my...

352
00:33:56,933 --> 00:33:58,959
I've lost my way.

353
00:34:03,671 --> 00:34:07,077
I just need to--
uh, Agnes, I just need to work.

354
00:34:08,310 --> 00:34:09,906
He's not sleeping.

355
00:34:10,042 --> 00:34:12,576
Has he ever lost
his temper with you? -No.

356
00:34:12,712 --> 00:34:14,876
- If he raises a hand...
- No, he has never.

357
00:34:15,011 --> 00:34:17,753
He's never.
He's angry with himself.

358
00:34:17,889 --> 00:34:20,183
He's sick with himself.

359
00:34:20,318 --> 00:34:21,884
He's a good man.

360
00:34:22,020 --> 00:34:22,889
He's a good husband,
he's a good father,

361
00:34:23,025 --> 00:34:24,757
but he n-needs more.

362
00:34:24,892 --> 00:34:27,096
What could he possibly need
other than his family and you?

363
00:34:27,232 --> 00:34:29,060
- He has you.
- He needs to go to London.

364
00:34:29,195 --> 00:34:31,431
- London?
- Yeah.

365
00:34:32,735 --> 00:34:35,503
Why London? -Because London is
where the whole world gathers.

366
00:34:35,639 --> 00:34:37,507
Perhaps he could extend
his father's business there.

367
00:34:37,642 --> 00:34:39,207
- Oh, you're being hasty again.
- Who knows what he may be...

368
00:34:39,343 --> 00:34:40,937
I'm not being hasty.
He needs more.

369
00:34:41,072 --> 00:34:42,008
- Well, he needs proper work.
- He's not of this world.

370
00:34:42,144 --> 00:34:43,841
The man needs proper work.

371
00:34:43,977 --> 00:34:45,446
- What's in this little town?
- He can't just run away.

372
00:34:45,582 --> 00:34:46,774
This little life?
This little thing, it'll...

373
00:34:46,910 --> 00:34:48,109
...crush him.

374
00:34:48,912 --> 00:34:50,284
He needs distance
from his father.

375
00:34:50,419 --> 00:34:51,814
And you would go with him
to London?

376
00:34:51,949 --> 00:34:53,923
No, I'll wait
until he's settled.

377
00:34:54,058 --> 00:34:55,454
There'll be more of us soon.

378
00:34:55,590 --> 00:34:57,986
- Another child?
- Yes. By summer's end.

379
00:34:58,121 --> 00:35:01,257
Then now is not
the time to send him away.

380
00:35:01,392 --> 00:35:03,227
I'll lose him.

381
00:35:03,363 --> 00:35:04,760
I'm already losing him.

382
00:35:04,896 --> 00:35:06,566
You'll lose him
if you send him away.

383
00:35:06,702 --> 00:35:09,764
No, I know, I know that
our love will keep us steady.

384
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:12,398
Please.
Will you speak to his father?

385
00:35:12,534 --> 00:35:15,772
He'll listen to you if you
suggest him going to London.

386
00:35:16,713 --> 00:35:18,247
Please.

387
00:35:20,283 --> 00:35:22,646
<i>I should find lodgings.</i>

388
00:35:22,782 --> 00:35:24,949
Be near the river,
close to the tanneries.

389
00:35:25,085 --> 00:35:28,323
But I'm told that the currents
in the river are dangerous

390
00:35:28,458 --> 00:35:30,492
and that you must engage
an experienced boatman

391
00:35:30,628 --> 00:35:32,487
every time you cross,
and I'll be certain to do that

392
00:35:32,622 --> 00:35:34,659
every time, I promise.

393
00:35:35,860 --> 00:35:37,426
And I will think of you
and Susanna

394
00:35:37,562 --> 00:35:38,893
with every passing moment.

395
00:35:39,029 --> 00:35:40,300
And I will find us
lodgings in London,

396
00:35:40,436 --> 00:35:42,264
and we shall all be
together again.

397
00:35:48,039 --> 00:35:49,977
Do you still not know
if it's a boy or a girl?

398
00:35:50,112 --> 00:35:51,538
No.

399
00:35:51,673 --> 00:35:53,209
Don't know why.

400
00:35:54,179 --> 00:35:56,177
Have you not said
that you would
always have two children?

401
00:35:56,313 --> 00:35:57,854
Yes.

402
00:35:57,989 --> 00:36:00,153
Two children at my deathbed.

403
00:36:00,288 --> 00:36:03,721
Well, then, here is the second.

404
00:36:13,732 --> 00:36:15,997
- We won't say goodbye.
- No.

405
00:36:21,836 --> 00:36:24,071
Get-- Go.

406
00:36:59,176 --> 00:37:01,380
- You going somewhere?
- No, I'm just...

407
00:37:01,515 --> 00:37:02,711
Yes, I'm going to the lake...

408
00:37:02,846 --> 00:37:04,881
You're not going to the forest.

409
00:37:08,326 --> 00:37:10,490
- I must.
- No, you must not. Gilbert!

410
00:37:10,625 --> 00:37:13,428
You... you have to let me
go there.

411
00:37:13,563 --> 00:37:15,563
-  Let me go there!
- Miss Agnes.

412
00:37:15,698 --> 00:37:18,100
- You must let me go!
- The river has burst its banks!

413
00:37:18,236 --> 00:37:19,931
- There is no way...
- Let me!

414
00:37:20,066 --> 00:37:21,436
There's no way to get
to the forest. -Let me! No!

415
00:37:21,572 --> 00:37:23,200
We have everything ready
for you. -My baby!

416
00:37:23,335 --> 00:37:24,939
No, my-my baby.

417
00:37:40,356 --> 00:37:41,623
I can't.

418
00:37:45,054 --> 00:37:47,555
I will not have my baby
in this house.

419
00:37:47,690 --> 00:37:49,059
Not in this house.

420
00:37:49,195 --> 00:37:50,729
No.

421
00:37:53,772 --> 00:37:55,162
The river.

422
00:37:55,297 --> 00:37:56,136
- Hush, hush, hush, hush. Hush.
- No, no, no, no.

423
00:37:56,272 --> 00:37:57,902
He spoke about the river.

424
00:37:58,037 --> 00:38:00,600
The river is dangerous.
He may be swept downstream!

425
00:38:02,244 --> 00:38:05,080
Agnes. Agnes. Agnes.

426
00:38:05,215 --> 00:38:07,744
Agnes, all is well with him.

427
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:09,286
Do you not recall
his last letter?

428
00:38:09,421 --> 00:38:10,614
Stop the screaming.

429
00:38:10,749 --> 00:38:11,746
You'll wake the whole town.

430
00:38:11,882 --> 00:38:12,988
He sound...

431
00:38:13,123 --> 00:38:14,652
He sounded different.

432
00:38:14,788 --> 00:38:16,917
No, he had good news for us.

433
00:38:17,052 --> 00:38:18,326
- The theater.
- Theater.

434
00:38:18,462 --> 00:38:20,458
He has a contract
with the players

435
00:38:20,593 --> 00:38:21,624
to make gloves for the theater.

436
00:38:21,759 --> 00:38:23,161
For the gloves. For the gloves.

437
00:38:24,462 --> 00:38:26,099
Agnes, hush now.

438
00:38:26,234 --> 00:38:27,464
Hush. Hush. Hush.

439
00:38:27,599 --> 00:38:28,837
Bear down. Bear down.

440
00:38:33,477 --> 00:38:35,201
Ah! Ooh!

441
00:38:35,336 --> 00:38:36,805
- There we go.
-It's a boy.

442
00:38:36,940 --> 00:38:39,046
There we go.

443
00:38:39,182 --> 00:38:42,115
Good boy. Good boy.

444
00:38:45,618 --> 00:38:47,153
It's a boy.

445
00:38:50,995 --> 00:38:52,762
It's a boy.

446
00:38:54,328 --> 00:38:55,792
My boy.

447
00:38:58,367 --> 00:38:59,831
Thank you.

448
00:39:14,145 --> 00:39:16,175
What is it? What's happening?

449
00:39:16,311 --> 00:39:18,182
She's starting again.

450
00:39:18,317 --> 00:39:20,350
- You're having twins, my girl.
-Come on, Eliza.

451
00:39:20,486 --> 00:39:22,825
Here. Quickly.

452
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:23,991
Take him.

453
00:39:29,330 --> 00:39:30,561
No, no.

454
00:39:30,696 --> 00:39:32,429
Two standing at my deathbed.

455
00:39:34,572 --> 00:39:36,402
I always believed
that it would be...

456
00:39:36,537 --> 00:39:39,002
that they would be my children.

457
00:39:40,142 --> 00:39:41,373
And now...

458
00:39:41,509 --> 00:39:43,245
now I see it will be you.

459
00:39:43,380 --> 00:39:44,509
We need to get you
to the stool.

460
00:39:44,645 --> 00:39:46,139
It's coming. It's here.

461
00:39:46,275 --> 00:39:48,016
- No.
- Come on. Come on up. Up, up.

462
00:39:48,151 --> 00:39:49,911
I can't... I...

463
00:39:50,047 --> 00:39:51,352
I can't.

464
00:39:51,487 --> 00:39:53,317
- Go.
- I should never have...

465
00:39:53,453 --> 00:39:55,051
I can't...

466
00:39:57,391 --> 00:39:59,062
I can't make it.

467
00:39:59,197 --> 00:40:00,755
I got it wrong. I got it wrong.

468
00:40:00,890 --> 00:40:02,790
I got it...

469
00:40:02,926 --> 00:40:05,259
He... He's not here.

470
00:40:05,394 --> 00:40:07,629
He's... He's not here.

471
00:40:07,764 --> 00:40:10,939
Agnes, you can...

472
00:40:11,075 --> 00:40:12,941
and you must.

473
00:40:13,076 --> 00:40:15,109
I cannot.

474
00:40:16,848 --> 00:40:17,913
Agnes.

475
00:40:19,214 --> 00:40:20,949
You can...

476
00:40:21,085 --> 00:40:22,850
and you will.

477
00:40:23,753 --> 00:40:28,953
Your husband was born here
in this room.

478
00:40:29,088 --> 00:40:33,089
He took his first breath
there by the window.

479
00:40:33,921 --> 00:40:35,799
Please.

480
00:40:37,895 --> 00:40:39,729
Please let this child live.

481
00:40:39,864 --> 00:40:42,598
Let this child live. Please.

482
00:40:42,734 --> 00:40:44,265
Will you let him...

483
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:47,468
Let him come back
and be with his child.

484
00:40:47,604 --> 00:40:49,103
Please.

485
00:40:49,239 --> 00:40:52,145
Let him think kindly
of me always.

486
00:40:52,280 --> 00:40:53,408
Remember me.

487
00:40:54,919 --> 00:40:56,453
Mama.

488
00:40:57,251 --> 00:40:58,385
Mama.

489
00:40:58,520 --> 00:41:00,318
<i>Mum?

490
00:41:07,221 --> 00:41:08,658
Just too weak.

491
00:41:08,794 --> 00:41:10,824
She was in too much pain.

492
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:12,168
I mean, poor woman.

493
00:41:12,303 --> 00:41:14,427
She just got weaker and weaker.

494
00:41:14,563 --> 00:41:16,164
I mean, that's just
the way of it sometimes.

495
00:41:16,300 --> 00:41:18,232
She-she must have known
the end was nigh.

496
00:41:18,368 --> 00:41:20,803
Best not speak of her
to the children.

497
00:41:20,939 --> 00:41:23,946
Safer with a different mother.

498
00:41:24,081 --> 00:41:26,148
So young.

499
00:41:26,284 --> 00:41:27,781
They may not remember her.

500
00:41:29,079 --> 00:41:30,978
-  Mum!
- Agnes. Agnes.

501
00:41:31,114 --> 00:41:33,186
- Mama, no!
- No, no. Agnes.

502
00:41:33,322 --> 00:41:34,689
Child. Child.

503
00:41:34,824 --> 00:41:36,718
- Mummy, no!
- No, no, no. Ch-Ch-Ch-- No.

504
00:41:36,853 --> 00:41:38,052
- No!
- No.

505
00:41:38,187 --> 00:41:40,162
- No, let me see her!
- No, no!

506
00:41:40,298 --> 00:41:41,964
- Let me see her!
- No!

507
00:41:42,099 --> 00:41:43,725
No, Mama!

508
00:41:43,860 --> 00:41:45,492
- Agnes.
- No!

509
00:41:46,462 --> 00:41:49,365
Mum. I want, I want my mum.

510
00:41:50,635 --> 00:41:51,765
I want my...

511
00:42:18,329 --> 00:42:20,236
Oh! Here we go! It's a girl!

512
00:42:20,372 --> 00:42:22,503
It's a girl. She's...

513
00:42:22,639 --> 00:42:25,168
It's... Wait.

514
00:42:29,378 --> 00:42:30,511
Come on. Come on.

515
00:42:30,647 --> 00:42:32,582
Why is she not crying?

516
00:42:34,714 --> 00:42:36,010
Why is she not crying?

517
00:42:36,145 --> 00:42:38,251
She lives not.

518
00:42:38,386 --> 00:42:40,053
Let me have her.

519
00:42:40,189 --> 00:42:41,188
You should not look
upon her. It's bad luck.

520
00:42:41,323 --> 00:42:42,690
Give her to me.

521
00:42:42,826 --> 00:42:43,917
I'll make sure
it gets a decent burial.

522
00:42:44,052 --> 00:42:45,925
Give me my child!

523
00:42:48,730 --> 00:42:50,633
My child.

524
00:42:53,363 --> 00:42:57,101
Agnes, you have a baby boy.

525
00:42:58,908 --> 00:43:01,908
Let me bring him to you,
and you may feed him.

526
00:43:03,678 --> 00:43:05,912
The girl has gone to heaven.

527
00:43:08,585 --> 00:43:10,884
She's not gone to heaven.

528
00:43:12,581 --> 00:43:15,516
I made a vow
the night my mother died.

529
00:43:16,886 --> 00:43:20,161
I will go to your church,
but I shan't say a word there.

530
00:44:00,067 --> 00:44:02,397
Yes. Yes.

531
00:44:11,447 --> 00:44:13,540
You will live.

532
00:44:15,418 --> 00:44:17,381
You will live.

533
00:44:18,317 --> 00:44:23,187
I will make sure
nothing ever takes you away.

534
00:44:44,540 --> 00:44:46,815
I actually couldn't find it.

535
00:44:55,687 --> 00:44:57,122
Hmm.

536
00:44:59,990 --> 00:45:01,456
Here.

537
00:45:02,463 --> 00:45:03,832
Perfect.

538
00:45:04,664 --> 00:45:06,494
I found my hat.

539
00:45:13,169 --> 00:45:15,371
Okay. Yes.

540
00:45:20,081 --> 00:45:22,284
Okay, take that side.
Take that side.

541
00:45:22,419 --> 00:45:23,717
Yeah.

542
00:45:23,852 --> 00:45:27,053
And put it around here.

543
00:45:27,950 --> 00:45:29,517
Perfect.

544
00:45:32,895 --> 00:45:35,193
- Ooh. Sorry.
- Let me help you.

545
00:45:41,132 --> 00:45:43,135
It's down my face.

546
00:45:50,738 --> 00:45:53,706
- I'm Hamnet.
- I'm Hamnet.

547
00:45:54,775 --> 00:45:58,415
- I'm Judith.
- I'm Judith.

548
00:45:59,923 --> 00:46:01,789
There will be no running
in this house.

549
00:46:01,925 --> 00:46:05,592
Conduct yourselves,
please, as...

550
00:46:05,728 --> 00:46:08,094
gentlewomen and gentlemen.

551
00:46:10,534 --> 00:46:12,298
Where are you going?

552
00:46:12,434 --> 00:46:14,903
Yeah. He's-he's coming.
He's coming.

553
00:46:18,200 --> 00:46:19,264
Hello.

554
00:46:19,400 --> 00:46:20,842
Hello.

555
00:46:20,978 --> 00:46:22,978
We all know
they've swapped clothes.

556
00:46:23,113 --> 00:46:25,005
How long are we going
to pretend we don't?

557
00:46:25,141 --> 00:46:27,080
We'll pretend for as long as
they think they're the same.

558
00:46:29,385 --> 00:46:30,952
Hi.

559
00:46:35,916 --> 00:46:37,657
Father, will you help me
with the Greek passage

560
00:46:37,793 --> 00:46:39,488
from yesterday's lesson?

561
00:46:39,623 --> 00:46:41,790
Hamnet, I thought
you'd already learnt it.

562
00:46:41,925 --> 00:46:44,630
I didn't because
I left my primer at school.

563
00:46:44,766 --> 00:46:46,032
Well, Hamnet,

564
00:46:46,167 --> 00:46:47,662
you need to take
your studies seriously.

565
00:46:47,797 --> 00:46:49,030
How do you expect to improve
if you're not...

566
00:46:59,174 --> 00:47:00,541
You rascals.

567
00:47:00,677 --> 00:47:03,017
- Did we trick you?
- Of course you did.

568
00:47:03,152 --> 00:47:05,184
You swapped places
to hoodwink me again.

569
00:47:09,285 --> 00:47:10,490
Susanna, come here.

570
00:47:10,625 --> 00:47:12,587
Come here.

571
00:47:15,726 --> 00:47:16,898
Now, do you remember the thing

572
00:47:17,033 --> 00:47:18,561
we were going to do
for your mother?

573
00:47:18,696 --> 00:47:20,194
Yeah. -You remember?
You ready to do it? -Yeah.

574
00:47:20,330 --> 00:47:22,203
Okay. Go outside quickly.

575
00:47:22,339 --> 00:47:25,402
Go, go, go, go,
go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

576
00:47:26,670 --> 00:47:28,304
- Just step toward...
-  Wait.

577
00:47:28,440 --> 00:47:30,536
One st--
Come to your right. Step.

578
00:47:30,671 --> 00:47:32,977
Step. One more.

579
00:47:33,113 --> 00:47:34,543
One more.

580
00:47:42,088 --> 00:47:45,057
When shall we three meet again?

581
00:47:45,193 --> 00:47:48,594
In thunder, lightning
or in rain?

582
00:47:48,729 --> 00:47:51,597
When hurly-burly's done,
when the battle's lost and won!

583
00:47:53,168 --> 00:47:57,168
That will be ere at set of sun.

584
00:47:57,304 --> 00:47:59,341
- Where the place?
- Upon the heath.

585
00:48:00,670 --> 00:48:01,674
There to meet with Agnes.

586
00:48:01,810 --> 00:48:03,576
I come, Graymalkin.

587
00:48:03,712 --> 00:48:05,372
Paddock calls.

588
00:48:05,508 --> 00:48:06,916
Anon!

589
00:48:07,051 --> 00:48:08,844
Fair is foul and foul is fair.

590
00:48:08,980 --> 00:48:12,478
Fair is foul and foul is fair.
Fair is foul and foul is fair.

591
00:48:12,614 --> 00:48:14,423
Fair is foul and foul is fair.

592
00:48:14,559 --> 00:48:15,547
Hover through the...

593
00:48:18,024 --> 00:48:19,087
Well done!

594
00:48:19,222 --> 00:48:21,460
That was amazing!

595
00:48:21,596 --> 00:48:23,797
Dig it deep, and then
you move all of it to the side,

596
00:48:23,933 --> 00:48:25,760
and then you put it down here.

597
00:48:25,895 --> 00:48:28,768
Right? And then you get
the soil around the sides,

598
00:48:28,904 --> 00:48:30,973
and then you pat it more.

599
00:48:32,172 --> 00:48:34,768
And then you get
bits like that.

600
00:48:39,083 --> 00:48:41,617
And you rub it in your hands.

601
00:48:41,753 --> 00:48:44,010
Whoa. And then back!

602
00:48:44,146 --> 00:48:45,514
Do this.

603
00:48:45,649 --> 00:48:47,921
And when you're
doing this, circle.

604
00:48:48,056 --> 00:48:49,885
Yeah, like that.

605
00:48:50,020 --> 00:48:51,383
Ready?

606
00:48:51,518 --> 00:48:53,287
Forward. And back.

607
00:48:53,423 --> 00:48:55,426
Now, parry, parry, parry.

608
00:48:56,632 --> 00:48:59,093
Good. Again.

609
00:49:00,764 --> 00:49:02,297
Now, after that one,
I'm gonna do this,

610
00:49:02,432 --> 00:49:03,729
and you get out of the way.

611
00:49:03,864 --> 00:49:05,966
Ready? Circle off.
Spin your sword.

612
00:49:06,102 --> 00:49:07,300
No.

613
00:49:07,436 --> 00:49:09,775
Circle, spin your sword.

614
00:49:09,910 --> 00:49:11,811
Now, come forward.

615
00:49:11,946 --> 00:49:13,582
And go back.

616
00:49:13,718 --> 00:49:15,781
One, two three.

617
00:49:15,917 --> 00:49:16,980
Out of the way!

618
00:49:17,115 --> 00:49:18,546
Very good. Again.

619
00:49:18,682 --> 00:49:19,921
Judith, what's this one called?

620
00:49:20,056 --> 00:49:21,452
-Thyme. Thyme.
- Rosemary.

621
00:49:21,587 --> 00:49:22,457
-Thyme. Thyme. Thyme.
- Thyme. Thyme.

622
00:49:24,821 --> 00:49:26,857
- I got it mixed up.
- That's okay.

623
00:49:26,992 --> 00:49:29,296
This one...

624
00:49:29,431 --> 00:49:31,591
-Now, that's rosemary.
-Yeah.

625
00:49:31,727 --> 00:49:33,330
And what is rosemary for?

626
00:49:33,466 --> 00:49:35,463
- Putting it in apples.
-Apples.

627
00:49:35,598 --> 00:49:37,072
No. Rosemary's for?

628
00:49:37,208 --> 00:49:38,299
Remembering.

629
00:49:38,435 --> 00:49:40,075
Remembering.

630
00:50:19,745 --> 00:50:22,975
Now, you're to rub
all this in your hands.

631
00:50:25,613 --> 00:50:27,815
You blow a little wish.

632
00:50:29,958 --> 00:50:32,094
To wish him on his way.

633
00:50:32,229 --> 00:50:35,196
Yeah?
And it's your secret with him.

634
00:50:42,837 --> 00:50:44,905
Did you see him?

635
00:50:45,040 --> 00:50:47,504
Did you not see him in the sky?

636
00:50:47,640 --> 00:50:49,842
All right, do it again.

637
00:50:49,977 --> 00:50:51,676
Make another wish.

638
00:50:54,543 --> 00:50:56,009
Look. Right up there.

639
00:50:56,912 --> 00:50:59,178
Look, just there.
Did you see him?

640
00:51:00,415 --> 00:51:04,753
And he's got all your wishes
tucked in his little heart.

641
00:51:04,888 --> 00:51:07,226
So any time that you want
to remember him,

642
00:51:07,362 --> 00:51:09,725
you just have to go...

643
00:51:11,059 --> 00:51:13,428
Where are you going?

644
00:51:13,564 --> 00:51:16,672
Huh? I'm gonna catch you!

645
00:51:16,808 --> 00:51:18,499
I'm gonna catch you!

646
00:51:23,208 --> 00:51:24,740
Father?

647
00:51:29,378 --> 00:51:31,111
Is all well?

648
00:51:31,247 --> 00:51:32,616
Yes.

649
00:51:36,393 --> 00:51:39,452
Listen, I want you to stay away
from your grandfather.

650
00:51:39,587 --> 00:51:42,256
He'll not hit your sisters,
but it's you that I worry for,

651
00:51:42,392 --> 00:51:44,297
and I need to know that you'll
be safe when I'm not here.

652
00:51:44,433 --> 00:51:46,964
You're going back
to London again?

653
00:51:47,100 --> 00:51:48,361
Yes, tomorrow.

654
00:51:48,496 --> 00:51:50,067
Tomorrow?

655
00:51:50,202 --> 00:51:51,767
It's all right.

656
00:51:53,010 --> 00:51:54,807
Will we go with you this time?

657
00:51:54,942 --> 00:51:56,541
No, not yet.

658
00:51:59,616 --> 00:52:00,974
Hey.

659
00:52:04,117 --> 00:52:05,616
I'll miss you.

660
00:52:06,653 --> 00:52:09,422
But I have to go,
you understand? I...

661
00:52:10,220 --> 00:52:11,655
I know.

662
00:52:12,521 --> 00:52:14,086
I understand.

663
00:52:15,293 --> 00:52:16,396
That's good.

664
00:52:18,064 --> 00:52:20,229
'Cause I need you to look after
your mother and your sisters.

665
00:52:20,364 --> 00:52:21,997
Will you do that?

666
00:52:22,133 --> 00:52:23,334
Yes.

667
00:52:23,469 --> 00:52:24,971
- Will you be brave?
- Yes.

668
00:52:25,107 --> 00:52:26,667
Yes?

669
00:52:26,802 --> 00:52:28,809
- Will you be brave?
- Yes.

670
00:52:28,945 --> 00:52:30,474
Will you be brave?!

671
00:52:30,610 --> 00:52:32,707
- Huh?!
- Yes! Yes, I'll be brave!

672
00:52:32,842 --> 00:52:36,152
I'll be brave. I'll be brave.

673
00:52:38,249 --> 00:52:41,157
<i>I've looked at houses
for us in London.</i>

674
00:52:43,787 --> 00:52:46,294
-Autumn is coming.
- Mm.

675
00:52:47,789 --> 00:52:50,023
And the children will fall ill.

676
00:52:51,797 --> 00:52:54,500
Judith, she's still
not strong enough.

677
00:52:54,635 --> 00:52:58,170
She often gets congestion
in her chest.

678
00:52:58,305 --> 00:53:00,807
And the air in London is...

679
00:53:00,943 --> 00:53:02,008
We can't.

680
00:53:02,144 --> 00:53:05,038
But one day soon, we will.

681
00:53:06,479 --> 00:53:08,910
We will come
to London with you.

682
00:53:10,183 --> 00:53:11,820
No, you won't.

683
00:53:11,955 --> 00:53:14,247
You'll never come.

684
00:53:15,317 --> 00:53:18,557
You've waited for
the heat of summer to pass...

685
00:53:20,195 --> 00:53:22,391
...the dryness of autumn,

686
00:53:22,526 --> 00:53:25,667
the snow and the cold.

687
00:53:26,670 --> 00:53:30,098
You do not believe that Judith
will ever survive London.

688
00:53:31,334 --> 00:53:34,837
You'd do anything in your power
to keep that child alive.

689
00:53:34,972 --> 00:53:36,876
Isn't that what a mother
is supposed to do?

690
00:53:37,011 --> 00:53:39,174
Of course it is.

691
00:53:39,309 --> 00:53:40,678
So...

692
00:53:43,884 --> 00:53:49,621
...I've decided to look
for land outside Stratford.

693
00:53:50,957 --> 00:53:53,493
That's where you should live
with the children.

694
00:53:55,527 --> 00:53:56,925
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

695
00:54:00,971 --> 00:54:02,694
Ooh!

696
00:54:02,829 --> 00:54:04,137
Where is she? Ah!

697
00:54:09,113 --> 00:54:12,006
Hamnet. There he is.

698
00:54:15,379 --> 00:54:16,978
Come here.

699
00:54:22,053 --> 00:54:24,458
I love you.
I love you. I love you.

700
00:54:26,062 --> 00:54:28,458
All right. Love you.

701
00:54:30,232 --> 00:54:32,125
- Come on.
- Love you.

702
00:54:33,394 --> 00:54:35,636
Love you.

703
00:54:35,772 --> 00:54:37,306
Oh.

704
00:54:39,572 --> 00:54:41,772
All right.
Come here.

705
00:54:42,808 --> 00:54:45,578
- Remember what
I told you, okay?
- Okay.

706
00:54:47,147 --> 00:54:48,812
Good boy.

707
00:54:50,878 --> 00:54:52,750
- Bye.
- Bye.

708
00:54:57,126 --> 00:54:58,888
- Bye.
- Bye.

709
00:55:00,892 --> 00:55:03,457
-  Bye.
-  Bye.

710
00:55:22,414 --> 00:55:24,144
Hamnet?

711
00:55:26,288 --> 00:55:28,522
Oh.

712
00:55:33,122 --> 00:55:35,694
Come on. Come here.

713
00:55:40,432 --> 00:55:42,162
Show me your hand.

714
00:55:43,535 --> 00:55:45,638
What? What do you see?

715
00:55:46,470 --> 00:55:48,542
I see you.

716
00:55:49,675 --> 00:55:52,341
Grown.

717
00:55:52,476 --> 00:55:54,845
And very strong.

718
00:55:56,081 --> 00:55:59,146
And I see you in London
working with your father.

719
00:56:01,587 --> 00:56:03,122
- In the theater?
- Yes.

720
00:56:03,257 --> 00:56:04,954
At the playhouse.

721
00:56:07,526 --> 00:56:09,064
What will I be doing?

722
00:56:09,199 --> 00:56:11,224
What do you wish to do, Hamnet?

723
00:56:11,360 --> 00:56:15,263
I should be one of the players
with a sword.

724
00:56:15,399 --> 00:56:17,001
A sword?

725
00:56:17,137 --> 00:56:18,872
Yes.

726
00:56:19,007 --> 00:56:22,006
And I shall clash it against
the sword of the other player.

727
00:56:22,142 --> 00:56:24,212
Show me.

728
00:56:24,347 --> 00:56:26,143
There'll be a terrible fight,

729
00:56:26,279 --> 00:56:30,843
and everybody watching will be
frightened out of their wits.

730
00:56:30,979 --> 00:56:33,086
And who will win?

731
00:56:33,222 --> 00:56:34,714
I shall, of course.

732
00:56:34,850 --> 00:56:36,854
Of course you shall.

733
00:56:48,238 --> 00:56:50,472
Something has upset them.

734
00:56:51,899 --> 00:56:54,173
What could it be?

735
00:56:54,309 --> 00:56:56,441
The weather?

736
00:56:56,577 --> 00:56:58,546
Something in the air, perhaps?

737
00:57:00,541 --> 00:57:03,419
Best tell Joan to keep
the children inside today.

738
00:59:53,688 --> 00:59:55,382
HAMNET
Judith?

739
01:00:00,030 --> 01:00:01,788
Judith?

740
01:00:01,924 --> 01:00:03,056
Where are you?

741
01:00:06,663 --> 01:00:07,899
Wake up!

742
01:00:08,035 --> 01:00:10,600
The baker told me
her cat had kittens.

743
01:00:10,736 --> 01:00:12,564
We need to see them.

744
01:00:19,274 --> 01:00:22,112
There's eight, Judith. Eight!

745
01:00:22,247 --> 01:00:24,653
We need to hurry.
It's going to rain.

746
01:00:28,289 --> 01:00:29,823
Judith?

747
01:00:31,523 --> 01:00:33,057
Jude?

748
01:00:36,057 --> 01:00:37,765
What's wrong?

749
01:00:40,470 --> 01:00:41,994
What's wrong, Judith?

750
01:00:42,129 --> 01:00:44,002
Judith, answer me.

751
01:00:45,406 --> 01:00:46,933
Judith, wake up.

752
01:00:47,069 --> 01:00:48,840
Judith, please. Judith.

753
01:01:03,660 --> 01:01:06,090
- What is it?
- It's Judith.

754
01:01:12,800 --> 01:01:13,995
How long
has she been like this?

755
01:01:14,131 --> 01:01:15,528
Since I returned from school.

756
01:01:19,137 --> 01:01:20,167
AGNES
Oh, my God.

757
01:01:20,303 --> 01:01:22,069
She's got it.

758
01:01:22,204 --> 01:01:23,972
Hasn't she?

759
01:01:24,108 --> 01:01:26,479
She's got the pestilence.

760
01:01:26,614 --> 01:01:28,382
Hasn't she, Mama?

761
01:01:28,518 --> 01:01:29,711
Go find your grandmother.

762
01:01:29,846 --> 01:01:31,216
Bid her to come.

763
01:01:31,352 --> 01:01:32,754
Now!

764
01:01:39,829 --> 01:01:41,185
<i>She's burning up.</i>

765
01:01:41,321 --> 01:01:43,489
We need, um, more water.

766
01:01:43,625 --> 01:01:45,196
Make a bigger fire
and heat up more water.

767
01:01:45,332 --> 01:01:47,361
- We need warm water.
-Eliza, fetch more water

768
01:01:47,497 --> 01:01:48,536
and bring the Bellis
from the kitchen.

769
01:01:48,671 --> 01:01:50,202
A row of cinnamon.

770
01:01:50,337 --> 01:01:51,329
Cinnamon, that's good
for drawing out the heat.

771
01:01:51,465 --> 01:01:53,104
Pineweed or a rue. Thyme, yes.

772
01:01:53,239 --> 01:01:54,766
You'll find them in the room.

773
01:01:54,901 --> 01:01:56,237
Mama. Yeah. -The
other table. The other side.

774
01:01:56,373 --> 01:01:57,735
Yeah, Mama's here, my love.

775
01:01:57,871 --> 01:02:00,073
Here, drink this.
It's rosemary and jelly.

776
01:02:00,208 --> 01:02:02,415
All will be well, hmm?

777
01:02:02,550 --> 01:02:04,076
All will be well.

778
01:02:04,211 --> 01:02:06,151
Judith, stay with.

779
01:02:06,286 --> 01:02:08,889
Mama's here.
It's okay. Mama's here.

780
01:02:09,024 --> 01:02:10,721
Rhubarb. We need rhubarb
to purge the stomach,

781
01:02:10,857 --> 01:02:11,854
drive out the pestilence.

782
01:02:11,990 --> 01:02:13,995
Can you go and fetch some?

783
01:02:14,131 --> 01:02:16,225
Mama's here. It's okay.
Judith, we're all here.

784
01:02:16,360 --> 01:02:17,766
Susanna, draw some water, too.

785
01:02:17,901 --> 01:02:19,558
Hamnet and...
and Mary and Susanna.

786
01:02:19,693 --> 01:02:21,360
Draw water as soon as you can.

787
01:02:21,496 --> 01:02:23,368
Why isn't he here?

788
01:02:24,538 --> 01:02:27,270
Eliza, go write to your
brother and tell him to come.

789
01:02:29,336 --> 01:02:31,747
Judith.

790
01:02:33,716 --> 01:02:36,082
Open your mouth, Judith.

791
01:02:36,217 --> 01:02:39,287
Open your mouth.
Mama's here. That's it.

792
01:02:39,422 --> 01:02:41,081
That's good.

793
01:02:41,217 --> 01:02:42,921
Yes, you'll be safe.

794
01:02:43,057 --> 01:02:45,225
You'll open your mouth.
Drink it down.

795
01:02:45,360 --> 01:02:48,621
Swallow it down. Mama's here.
It's okay, Judith.

796
01:02:49,933 --> 01:02:52,067
Mama's here. It's okay.

797
01:02:52,202 --> 01:02:53,093
Okay.

798
01:03:21,231 --> 01:03:22,490
Agnes.

799
01:03:23,332 --> 01:03:24,690
Agnes.

800
01:03:25,800 --> 01:03:28,463
You have done all that you can.

801
01:03:31,169 --> 01:03:33,468
I will not let her cross over.

802
01:03:46,485 --> 01:03:50,683
Grandmama, you had three
daughters that were taken.

803
01:03:54,826 --> 01:03:56,458
Were they...

804
01:03:57,996 --> 01:03:59,730
Were they like Judith?

805
01:04:03,263 --> 01:04:05,071
Anne was seven.

806
01:04:07,303 --> 01:04:09,676
The other two were just babies.

807
01:04:09,812 --> 01:04:12,507
They all had swellings and...

808
01:04:14,309 --> 01:04:16,617
...fever like Judith.

809
01:04:16,753 --> 01:04:19,179
Your mother's trying to...

810
01:04:19,315 --> 01:04:21,516
keep a grip on her child.

811
01:04:22,350 --> 01:04:24,222
It won't work.

812
01:04:27,525 --> 01:04:30,925
What is given may be
taken away at any time.

813
01:04:33,628 --> 01:04:36,201
We must never let
our guard down.

814
01:04:37,641 --> 01:04:40,403
Never take for granted...

815
01:04:42,507 --> 01:04:44,974
...that our children's
hearts beat,

816
01:04:45,109 --> 01:04:47,582
that they draw breath,

817
01:04:47,717 --> 01:04:51,348
that they walk and speak and...

818
01:04:53,953 --> 01:04:56,518
...smile, argue, play.

819
01:05:00,053 --> 01:05:04,031
Never forget for a moment
that they may be gone.

820
01:05:11,037 --> 01:05:12,941
Jude.

821
01:05:55,451 --> 01:05:56,743
Jude.

822
01:06:08,290 --> 01:06:10,163
Don't be sad.

823
01:06:12,096 --> 01:06:14,398
You shall be well.

824
01:06:15,564 --> 01:06:17,500
I shall not.

825
01:06:18,299 --> 01:06:20,333
Not without you.

826
01:06:32,116 --> 01:06:33,983
It's here.

827
01:06:34,119 --> 01:06:35,720
Do you see it, Jude?

828
01:06:42,259 --> 01:06:44,131
It's watching us.

829
01:06:45,462 --> 01:06:47,428
I'll tell it to take us both.

830
01:06:47,563 --> 01:06:50,038
We'll go together.

831
01:06:57,438 --> 01:06:59,337
Turn away.

832
01:06:59,472 --> 01:07:01,313
Turn away.

833
01:07:09,023 --> 01:07:10,524
It'll make a mistake.

834
01:07:12,125 --> 01:07:14,022
It can't tell us apart.

835
01:07:16,491 --> 01:07:18,698
Breathe with me, Judith.

836
01:07:51,031 --> 01:07:53,865
I give you my life.

837
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:56,232
You shall be well.

838
01:07:56,367 --> 01:07:59,272
I give you my life, Judith.

839
01:08:05,407 --> 01:08:07,478
I'll be brave.

840
01:08:09,083 --> 01:08:11,542
I'll be brave, Father.

841
01:08:11,677 --> 01:08:13,484
I'll be brave.

842
01:08:16,726 --> 01:08:18,357
I'll be brave.

843
01:08:19,588 --> 01:08:20,958
I'll be brave, Father.

844
01:08:21,093 --> 01:08:22,761
I'll be brave.

845
01:08:25,262 --> 01:08:27,267
<i>I'll be brave.</i>

846
01:08:54,421 --> 01:08:55,420
Whoa.

847
01:08:57,228 --> 01:08:58,859
Quick as you can.

848
01:09:44,873 --> 01:09:46,347
Hamnet.

849
01:09:46,482 --> 01:09:47,838
Hamnet, you're not
supposed to be down here.

850
01:09:47,974 --> 01:09:49,811
I need to take you up to bed.

851
01:09:55,955 --> 01:09:57,390
Hamnet.

852
01:09:58,894 --> 01:10:00,492
Hamnet?

853
01:10:21,684 --> 01:10:23,317
Mama.

854
01:10:26,480 --> 01:10:28,080
Mama.

855
01:10:31,320 --> 01:10:32,887
Mama.

856
01:11:20,376 --> 01:11:22,140
Hamnet.

857
01:11:22,276 --> 01:11:24,075
You must open your mouth.

858
01:11:25,546 --> 01:11:26,871
All will be well.

859
01:11:37,454 --> 01:11:39,052
He's burning.

860
01:11:39,187 --> 01:11:40,591
He's burning up.

861
01:11:40,726 --> 01:11:42,621
It will not sti--
It will not stick!

862
01:11:44,563 --> 01:11:46,194
A stone. There's a stone.

863
01:11:46,329 --> 01:11:47,664
There's a stone upstairs with
a hole in the middle of it.

864
01:11:47,800 --> 01:11:49,927
By his bedside.
Bring it down. I need it.

865
01:11:50,062 --> 01:11:51,971
And, um, uh, salt. Get salt.

866
01:11:52,107 --> 01:11:53,706
Get it. Can you give it?

867
01:11:53,842 --> 01:11:56,471
Can you f-fetch me some salt,
as much salt as you have.

868
01:11:56,606 --> 01:11:57,836
Water. We need water.

869
01:11:57,972 --> 01:11:59,770
He's... he's too hot.

870
01:11:59,905 --> 01:12:01,306
He's burning.

871
01:12:01,441 --> 01:12:03,482
My love. Mama's here.

872
01:12:03,617 --> 01:12:05,512
All will be well.
All will be well.

873
01:12:05,647 --> 01:12:07,212
All will be well.

874
01:12:10,784 --> 01:12:12,492
All will be well.

875
01:12:15,890 --> 01:12:19,032
Hamnet, don't be scared.

876
01:12:19,167 --> 01:12:20,761
No need to be scared.

877
01:12:20,896 --> 01:12:22,696
All will be well. Mommy's here.

878
01:12:22,832 --> 01:12:25,466
Mommy's here. It's okay.

879
01:12:25,601 --> 01:12:26,832
Mommy's here.

880
01:12:26,968 --> 01:12:28,669
Look at me. Mommy's here.

881
01:12:28,805 --> 01:12:31,636
I will never, ever let you go.

882
01:12:31,771 --> 01:12:33,271
You understand?

883
01:12:33,406 --> 01:12:35,948
I will never, ever let you go.

884
01:12:36,083 --> 01:12:37,682
I love you.

885
01:12:39,350 --> 01:12:40,645
I love you.

886
01:12:49,997 --> 01:12:53,429
Eliza, take Judith to
the kitchen and keep her there.

887
01:12:53,564 --> 01:12:54,930
Please!

888
01:12:56,802 --> 01:12:59,037
- He needs me!
-Stay there.

889
01:12:59,172 --> 01:13:01,499
He needs me!

890
01:13:01,635 --> 01:13:03,072
Please!

891
01:13:08,181 --> 01:13:09,846
Valerian...

892
01:13:11,384 --> 01:13:13,915
Hamnet. Hamnet. Hamnet.

893
01:13:14,051 --> 01:13:16,753
Hamnet, you have to stay.
Hamnet, please.

894
01:13:16,889 --> 01:13:18,818
Hamnet, please.
You have to stay with us.

895
01:13:18,953 --> 01:13:20,528
Mama needs you. We need you.

896
01:13:20,663 --> 01:13:22,560
-Stop! Enough!
- Stay with us. Stay, stay.

897
01:13:22,696 --> 01:13:23,990
Please, Hamnet.
Hamnet, Hamnet, Hamnet.

898
01:13:24,126 --> 01:13:25,698
-Let him alone!
- Hamnet, please!

899
01:13:25,834 --> 01:13:28,931
Can't you see that
it's too late for him!

900
01:13:29,796 --> 01:13:32,101
Please, please.

901
01:13:32,237 --> 01:13:33,503
Hamnet?

902
01:13:33,639 --> 01:13:35,938
Hamnet. Hamnet.

903
01:14:21,081 --> 01:14:23,381
My son is gone.

904
01:14:25,961 --> 01:14:27,258
My son.

905
01:14:27,393 --> 01:14:28,655
I've lost my...

906
01:15:36,458 --> 01:15:39,732
I saw the light,
and I couldn't sleep.

907
01:15:47,200 --> 01:15:48,906
MARY
Here.

908
01:16:08,826 --> 01:16:10,390
Oh, child, no.

909
01:16:10,525 --> 01:16:13,128
- No, no, no. Go to bed.
- No, no, let-let her stay.

910
01:16:16,395 --> 01:16:17,930
It is my fault, Mama.

911
01:16:18,066 --> 01:16:20,238
- It is my fault.
- No. No.

912
01:16:21,972 --> 01:16:25,906
It is not your fault, Judith.

913
01:16:26,042 --> 01:16:28,048
But he changed places with me.

914
01:16:28,184 --> 01:16:29,214
He tricked it.

915
01:16:29,349 --> 01:16:30,841
He tricked what?

916
01:16:30,976 --> 01:16:31,918
Death.

917
01:16:32,054 --> 01:16:33,585
Judith.

918
01:16:33,720 --> 01:16:36,219
It took him
when it came for me.

919
01:16:37,222 --> 01:16:39,957
Never say those words
to anyone ever again.

920
01:16:41,556 --> 01:16:44,456
The fever came
for your brother,
and it took him.

921
01:16:45,697 --> 01:16:47,932
Do you wish to see him?

922
01:16:49,269 --> 01:16:50,638
Yes.

923
01:16:59,106 --> 01:17:01,110
Go on. You can see him.

924
01:17:12,987 --> 01:17:14,959
Is it really him?

925
01:17:16,461 --> 01:17:17,863
Yes.

926
01:17:20,429 --> 01:17:23,363
It-it doesn't look like him.

927
01:17:26,603 --> 01:17:27,939
No.

928
01:17:34,811 --> 01:17:36,941
It's not him.

929
01:17:37,077 --> 01:17:38,653
It's not.

930
01:17:39,750 --> 01:17:40,781
It's not him.

931
01:17:43,626 --> 01:17:45,087
It-It's-it's not morning yet.

932
01:17:45,223 --> 01:17:47,150
We haven't
prepared him properly.

933
01:17:48,827 --> 01:17:50,764
Am I too late?

934
01:17:57,265 --> 01:17:58,195
- It's you.
-Father.

935
01:17:58,331 --> 01:18:00,631
It's you.

936
01:18:06,547 --> 01:18:07,676
It's me.

937
01:18:25,861 --> 01:18:27,493
Where is he?

938
01:18:30,371 --> 01:18:31,871
Where is...

939
01:18:36,442 --> 01:18:37,811
Where...

940
01:19:22,589 --> 01:19:24,882
It's my boy.

941
01:19:29,255 --> 01:19:31,227
It's my boy.

942
01:19:52,949 --> 01:19:54,921
I didn't see it.

943
01:20:01,788 --> 01:20:04,095
I should've paid him
more attention.

944
01:20:04,231 --> 01:20:06,126
I always thought
she was the one
to be taken away

945
01:20:06,262 --> 01:20:08,594
when all the while it was him.

946
01:20:09,438 --> 01:20:11,171
I'm a fool.

947
01:20:11,306 --> 01:20:14,499
No, there's nothing anyone
could have done to save him.

948
01:20:14,634 --> 01:20:16,804
You did everything
that you could.

949
01:20:16,939 --> 01:20:18,505
Of course I did.

950
01:20:19,977 --> 01:20:21,542
You weren't here.

951
01:20:21,678 --> 01:20:23,314
I would have cut my heart out
and given it to him.

952
01:20:23,449 --> 01:20:24,885
I would have laid my life down
on the ground for him.

953
01:20:25,021 --> 01:20:26,952
- I-I know. I know.
- And no one would take it.

954
01:20:27,088 --> 01:20:29,680
- But you...
- No, you don't know.

955
01:20:29,816 --> 01:20:32,519
You don't know.
You weren't here.

956
01:20:34,386 --> 01:20:35,953
He died in agony.

957
01:20:36,089 --> 01:20:37,458
I...

958
01:20:40,329 --> 01:20:41,864
- He was in agony.
- Agnes.

959
01:20:41,999 --> 01:20:43,531
He cried and he cried

960
01:20:43,666 --> 01:20:45,204
- and he cried and he cried.
- Agnes, stop, stop.

961
01:20:45,339 --> 01:20:46,836
And his little body was
wracked in pain. -

962
01:20:46,972 --> 01:20:48,265
No, don't shush me.

963
01:20:48,400 --> 01:20:49,710
He was so scared.

964
01:20:49,846 --> 01:20:51,670
- And you weren't here.
- I know.

965
01:20:55,842 --> 01:20:57,343
I tried everything I could.

966
01:20:57,478 --> 01:20:59,019
I know you did.

967
01:20:59,154 --> 01:21:01,722
I tried... -You did
everything that you could.

968
01:21:01,857 --> 01:21:04,720
You did everything
that you could.

969
01:21:04,855 --> 01:21:06,421
Everything.

970
01:21:07,829 --> 01:21:10,254
Everything.

971
01:21:12,358 --> 01:21:14,869
Agnes. Agnes.

972
01:21:38,385 --> 01:21:40,186
I will send word, Agnes.

973
01:21:40,321 --> 01:21:42,562
You'll send word?

974
01:21:42,698 --> 01:21:44,932
- To whom?
- To you.

975
01:21:52,807 --> 01:21:54,770
- I'm here.
- Mm.

976
01:21:55,807 --> 01:21:58,244
What I meant was that I shall
send word when I reach London.

977
01:21:58,380 --> 01:22:00,013
London?

978
01:22:01,583 --> 01:22:03,379
I must leave.

979
01:22:06,414 --> 01:22:07,912
Leave? How can you leave?

980
01:22:08,047 --> 01:22:11,387
The world does simply not
stand still, Agnes.

981
01:22:14,624 --> 01:22:16,487
There are people
waiting for me in London.

982
01:22:16,623 --> 01:22:18,230
The season is about to begin,

983
01:22:18,365 --> 01:22:21,463
and my company shall return
from Kent any day now.

984
01:22:26,272 --> 01:22:29,009
I have to go now.

985
01:22:29,939 --> 01:22:31,506
Now?

986
01:22:31,641 --> 01:22:33,473
There's a traveling party
leaving today,

987
01:22:33,609 --> 01:22:36,412
and they have a spare horse,
so yeah.

988
01:22:38,110 --> 01:22:40,210
Look after the girls,
and I will return to--

989
01:22:40,345 --> 01:22:41,714
Stop.

990
01:22:42,558 --> 01:22:44,783
Don't.

991
01:23:12,586 --> 01:23:14,714
Go. Go.

992
01:23:26,267 --> 01:23:27,997
<i>"When I do count the clock</i>

993
01:23:28,133 --> 01:23:29,962
<i>"that tells the time,</i>

994
01:23:30,098 --> 01:23:34,174
<i>"And see the brave day sunk

995
01:23:34,309 --> 01:23:37,334
<i>"When I behold the violet

996
01:23:37,469 --> 01:23:41,477
<i>"And sable curls

997
01:23:41,613 --> 01:23:45,384

998
01:23:45,520 --> 01:23:48,783
<i>"Which erst from the heat

999
01:23:48,919 --> 01:23:53,326
<i>"And summer's green

1000
01:23:53,462 --> 01:23:58,330

1001
01:23:58,465 --> 01:24:01,828

1002
01:24:01,963 --> 01:24:04,501

1007
01:24:20,714 --> 01:24:22,718
Will you read it again?

1008
01:24:22,854 --> 01:24:24,417
No.

1009
01:24:24,553 --> 01:24:26,555
I've read it three times.

1010
01:24:27,389 --> 01:24:29,393
That's enough.

1011
01:24:32,826 --> 01:24:34,366
<i>Shall we do presents?</i>

1012
01:24:34,501 --> 01:24:35,394
Presents from London.

1013
01:24:35,530 --> 01:24:37,537
A hair comb for you, Jude.

1014
01:24:39,571 --> 01:24:41,598
Mind you,
you'll have to be careful.

1015
01:24:47,882 --> 01:24:49,375
This is for you, Agnes.

1016
01:24:58,885 --> 01:25:01,027
- A ruby, is it?
-Mm-hmm.

1017
01:25:01,162 --> 01:25:03,691
It's the finest I've ever seen.

1018
01:25:04,761 --> 01:25:07,428
Everyone's talking about
the new house.

1019
01:25:07,564 --> 01:25:09,235
It's the biggest in Stratford.

1020
01:25:09,370 --> 01:25:12,105
There are so many rooms.
One could get lost.

1021
01:25:12,241 --> 01:25:14,600
You shall keep
the keys, Susanna.

1022
01:25:14,735 --> 01:25:16,935
You shall manage
the house well.

1023
01:25:18,273 --> 01:25:19,905
Put it on, Mama.

1024
01:25:40,169 --> 01:25:43,229
Did Bartholomew show you
the new house?

1025
01:25:43,365 --> 01:25:44,798
Mm-hmm.

1026
01:25:47,104 --> 01:25:48,802
Do you like it?

1027
01:25:50,279 --> 01:25:52,509
Why didn't you show me
yourself?

1028
01:25:53,743 --> 01:25:56,282
Were you afraid
I wouldn't leave?

1029
01:25:58,451 --> 01:26:00,979
'Cause Hamnet died here
in this house.

1030
01:26:09,662 --> 01:26:12,199
You know, I'm constantly
wondering where he is.

1031
01:26:14,331 --> 01:26:16,335
Or where he has gone.

1032
01:26:17,969 --> 01:26:21,802
Whatever I'm doing,
I'm wondering, "Where is he?"

1033
01:26:23,476 --> 01:26:25,806
I mean, he can't have
just vanished.

1034
01:26:28,184 --> 01:26:30,179
All he needs is
for me to find him.

1035
01:26:30,314 --> 01:26:32,780
He must be somewhere.

1036
01:26:34,017 --> 01:26:37,889
I fear I may run mad with it,
even now, a year on.

1037
01:26:38,024 --> 01:26:39,919
A year is nothing.

1038
01:26:43,997 --> 01:26:45,062
A year is nothing.

1039
01:26:45,198 --> 01:26:48,031
It's every second...

1040
01:26:48,167 --> 01:26:50,336
every minute, every day.

1041
01:26:52,868 --> 01:26:55,165
We may never stop
looking for him.

1042
01:26:57,638 --> 01:26:59,675
I'm sorry, Agnes.

1043
01:27:02,276 --> 01:27:03,675
Did you hear me?
I said that I'm sorry, Agnes.

1044
01:27:03,811 --> 01:27:05,218
- For what?
- For everything.

1045
01:27:05,354 --> 01:27:06,582
- You're caught by that place.
- For...

1046
01:27:06,718 --> 01:27:08,388
- What place?
- That place in your head.

1047
01:27:08,523 --> 01:27:10,181
It is now more real to you
than anywhere else.

1048
01:27:10,317 --> 01:27:14,855
Not even the death of our child
can keep you from it.

1049
01:27:15,896 --> 01:27:18,028
Hamnet died.

1050
01:27:18,163 --> 01:27:19,959
A horrible death.

1051
01:27:21,234 --> 01:27:23,402
And you should have been there.

1052
01:27:24,403 --> 01:27:26,438
You could have
bid him farewell.

1053
01:27:56,563 --> 01:27:58,602
What do you see?

1054
01:27:59,873 --> 01:28:01,308
Hmm?

1055
01:28:05,879 --> 01:28:07,446
Nothing.

1056
01:28:12,050 --> 01:28:13,650
Nothing?

1057
01:28:15,747 --> 01:28:17,617
Nothing at all.

1058
01:28:17,752 --> 01:28:19,425
Oh, well.

1059
01:28:24,166 --> 01:28:26,465
You should go back to London.

1060
01:28:27,832 --> 01:28:31,162
You need not concern yourself
with us.

1061
01:28:32,966 --> 01:28:35,335
Get along just fine
without you.

1062
01:28:38,975 --> 01:28:40,842
<i>This was sometime a paradox,</i>

1063
01:28:40,977 --> 01:28:43,641
<i>but now the time
gives it proof.</i>

1064
01:28:43,777 --> 01:28:46,013
I did love you once.

1065
01:28:46,148 --> 01:28:49,950
Indeed, my lord,
you made me believe so.

1066
01:28:50,085 --> 01:28:53,284
You should not have
believed me,

1067
01:28:53,420 --> 01:28:58,255
for virtue cannot so inoculate
our old stock for...

1068
01:28:59,960 --> 01:29:01,632
You should not
have believed me,

1069
01:29:01,768 --> 01:29:04,465
for virtue cannot
so inoculate our old stock

1070
01:29:04,601 --> 01:29:06,703
but we shall relish of it.

1071
01:29:08,503 --> 01:29:10,344
I loved you not.

1072
01:29:11,510 --> 01:29:13,710
I was the more deceived.

1073
01:29:15,140 --> 01:29:17,516
Get thee to a nunnery.

1074
01:29:17,651 --> 01:29:20,845
Why wouldst thou be
a breeder of sinners?

1075
01:29:20,980 --> 01:29:23,389
I am myself indifferent honest,

1076
01:29:23,524 --> 01:29:25,324
but yet I could accuse me
of such things

1077
01:29:25,459 --> 01:29:27,323
that it were better to...

1078
01:29:27,459 --> 01:29:29,319
Again.

1079
01:29:30,197 --> 01:29:32,192
Get thee to a nunnery.

1080
01:29:33,161 --> 01:29:35,863
Why wouldst thou be
a breeder of sinners?

1081
01:29:35,999 --> 01:29:38,197
I am myself
indifferent honest, but...

1082
01:29:38,332 --> 01:29:40,568
Again. "I am myself
indifferent honest." Again.

1083
01:29:40,703 --> 01:29:42,499
I am myself indifferent honest,

1084
01:29:42,635 --> 01:29:44,871
but yet I could accuse me of
such things that it were better

1085
01:29:45,007 --> 01:29:47,381
- my mother had not borne me.
- Again.

1086
01:29:48,708 --> 01:29:51,182
I, myself...

1087
01:29:51,318 --> 01:29:53,185
Again.

1088
01:29:53,320 --> 01:29:54,920
I, myself, am indifferent...

1089
01:29:55,056 --> 01:29:56,551
"I am myself."

1090
01:29:56,686 --> 01:29:59,417
I am myself indifferent honest,

1091
01:29:59,553 --> 01:30:02,828
but yet I could accuse me
of such things that it were...

1092
01:30:02,963 --> 01:30:04,554
Again.

1093
01:30:04,690 --> 01:30:05,864
But yet I could accuse me
of such things that it were...

1094
01:30:05,999 --> 01:30:07,166
Again!

1095
01:30:07,301 --> 01:30:08,500
I am myself indifferent honest,

1096
01:30:08,635 --> 01:30:09,863
but yet I could accuse me
of such...

1097
01:30:09,998 --> 01:30:12,604
You are simply
mouthing the words!

1098
01:30:15,243 --> 01:30:18,345
I am myself indifferent honest,

1099
01:30:18,480 --> 01:30:20,580
but yet I could accuse me
of such things

1100
01:30:20,715 --> 01:30:23,879
that it were better
my mother had not borne me.

1101
01:30:25,377 --> 01:30:28,286
I am very proud,
revengeful, ambitious,

1102
01:30:28,422 --> 01:30:29,982
with more offenses at my beck

1103
01:30:30,118 --> 01:30:33,725
than I have thoughts
to put them in,

1104
01:30:33,861 --> 01:30:38,257
imagination to give them shape
or time to act them in.

1105
01:30:39,094 --> 01:30:40,630
Now, what should
such fellows as I do

1106
01:30:40,766 --> 01:30:42,464
crawling between
heaven and earth?

1107
01:30:42,600 --> 01:30:43,926
We are arrant knaves all.

1108
01:30:44,062 --> 01:30:46,437
Believe none of us.

1109
01:30:46,572 --> 01:30:49,300
Go thy ways
to a nunnery. Again.

1110
01:31:33,317 --> 01:31:34,317
To be...

1111
01:31:39,985 --> 01:31:41,957
...or not to be...

1112
01:31:49,666 --> 01:31:51,703
...that is the question:

1113
01:31:59,275 --> 01:32:03,711
Whether 'tis nobler
in the mind to... suffer

1114
01:32:03,846 --> 01:32:06,476
The slings and arrows of...

1115
01:32:09,521 --> 01:32:11,789
...outrageous fortune...

1116
01:32:14,996 --> 01:32:16,629
...Or...

1117
01:32:18,663 --> 01:32:21,194
...to take arms against a...

1118
01:32:23,337 --> 01:32:25,533
...sea of troubles,

1119
01:32:25,668 --> 01:32:28,069
And by opposing...

1120
01:32:30,177 --> 01:32:31,743
...end them.

I... I was in town, and I...

1128
01:34:02,560 --> 01:34:04,803
I thought
I would pay you a visit.

1129
01:34:06,370 --> 01:34:09,803
I was very sorry
to hear about John's passing.

1130
01:34:09,939 --> 01:34:11,836
How's your husband?

1131
01:34:11,971 --> 01:34:13,973
It's a... it's a terrible thing
to lose one's father.

1132
01:34:14,109 --> 01:34:15,682
He's well.

1133
01:34:15,817 --> 01:34:18,113
He's very busy.
He's preparing a comedy.

1134
01:34:18,248 --> 01:34:21,017
His new play is not a comedy.

1135
01:34:22,081 --> 01:34:24,113
It's a tragedy.

1136
01:34:24,248 --> 01:34:26,592
But you knew that.

1137
01:34:26,728 --> 01:34:29,487
Everyone in town
is talking about it.

1138
01:34:39,531 --> 01:34:41,708
I did warn you
about marrying him.

1139
01:34:41,843 --> 01:34:44,172
Don't pretend
that you care for me.

1140
01:34:45,979 --> 01:34:49,540
You are not my mother,
and you never were.

1141
01:34:59,557 --> 01:35:01,420
Good day, Agnes.

1142
01:35:06,692 --> 01:35:08,134
He's not spoken to us
for months.

1143
01:35:08,269 --> 01:35:09,500
How could he...

1144
01:35:09,636 --> 01:35:11,163
How could he not tell us?

1145
01:35:11,298 --> 01:35:13,872
Do you not wonder
what is in it?

1146
01:35:15,473 --> 01:35:17,167
In what?

1147
01:35:17,303 --> 01:35:18,976
The play.

1148
01:36:33,785 --> 01:36:35,816
Who are you looking for?

1149
01:36:35,952 --> 01:36:38,482
William Shakespeare.

1150
01:36:38,617 --> 01:36:40,321
We're his family
from Stratford.

1151
01:36:40,456 --> 01:36:42,994
Go up the stairs.
He lives in the attic.

1152
01:36:59,741 --> 01:37:02,138
Why would the man with
the largest house in Stratford

1153
01:37:02,273 --> 01:37:04,378
be living here?

1154
01:37:14,960 --> 01:37:17,655
I don't understand.

1155
01:37:19,059 --> 01:37:20,691
I thought...

1156
01:37:22,095 --> 01:37:23,628
I thought he...

1157
01:37:30,334 --> 01:37:32,472
What shall I do?

1158
01:37:35,583 --> 01:37:37,312
Keep your heart open.

1159
01:39:34,698 --> 01:39:36,096
-Who's there?
-Nay, answer me:

1160
01:39:36,232 --> 01:39:37,331
stand and unfold yourself!

1161
01:39:37,466 --> 01:39:39,001
Long live the king!

1162
01:39:39,136 --> 01:39:40,567
Bernardo?

1163
01:39:40,702 --> 01:39:42,338
If you do meet
Horatio and Marcellus,

1164
01:39:42,473 --> 01:39:45,502
The rivals to my watch,
bid them make haste.

1165
01:39:45,637 --> 01:39:48,107
I think I hear them. Stand, ho!

1166
01:39:48,242 --> 01:39:49,807
Who's there?

1167
01:39:51,450 --> 01:39:54,351
Has this thing
appeared again tonight?

1168
01:39:54,487 --> 01:39:56,483
- I have seen nothing.
-Horatio says...

1169
01:39:56,619 --> 01:39:58,151
What are they talking about?

1170
01:40:00,428 --> 01:40:03,457
What has any of this to do
with my son? -

1171
01:40:03,592 --> 01:40:05,187
These men are frightened.

1172
01:40:05,323 --> 01:40:06,692
Of what?

1173
01:40:07,702 --> 01:40:09,662
They watch for a ghost.

1174
01:40:12,473 --> 01:40:13,530
Ghost?

1175
01:40:13,665 --> 01:40:14,974
...The bell then beating one...

1176
01:40:15,109 --> 01:40:17,973
Peace, break thee off!

1177
01:40:18,109 --> 01:40:19,707
Look where it comes again!

1178
01:40:19,842 --> 01:40:22,939
In the same figure,
like the king that's dead.

1179
01:40:28,646 --> 01:40:30,049
See, it stalks away!

1180
01:40:30,185 --> 01:40:31,552
That was him.

1181
01:40:33,291 --> 01:40:35,785
That was Will.

1182
01:40:35,920 --> 01:40:37,222
- He's not in the play.
- No, no.

1183
01:40:37,358 --> 01:40:39,198
It was Will as a ghost.

1184
01:40:39,333 --> 01:40:41,727
Our last king, Whose image
but now appeared to us,

1185
01:40:41,862 --> 01:40:45,401
Was dared to the combat;
our valiant Hamlet...

1186
01:40:45,537 --> 01:40:47,504
Hamlet.

1187
01:40:48,240 --> 01:40:49,602
Did you hear...
did you hear that?

1188
01:40:49,737 --> 01:40:51,042
Yes.

1189
01:40:51,178 --> 01:40:52,878
They said his--
they said his name.

1190
01:40:53,013 --> 01:40:54,341
Agnes.

1191
01:40:54,476 --> 01:40:56,715
- Agnes, wait.
- Out of my way!

1192
01:40:56,851 --> 01:40:58,445
Please be quiet.

1193
01:40:58,581 --> 01:41:01,020
Wait, did they say
his name? Huh?

1194
01:41:01,156 --> 01:41:03,086
Do not upset yourself.

1195
01:41:03,221 --> 01:41:04,917
Why is--
Why did he use his name?

1196
01:41:05,052 --> 01:41:06,856
- I don't know him.
-  -MAN: Quiet.

1197
01:41:06,992 --> 01:41:08,259
...and by my advice,

1198
01:41:08,394 --> 01:41:09,386
Let us impart
what we have seen tonight

1199
01:41:09,522 --> 01:41:10,954
Unto the young prince...

1200
01:41:11,090 --> 01:41:12,857
Don't you dare pronounce
my son's name!

1201
01:41:12,992 --> 01:41:14,429
Quiet!

1202
01:41:14,565 --> 01:41:17,201
...dumb to us,
will speak to him.

1203
01:41:24,137 --> 01:41:27,008
Though yet of
our dear brother's death,

1204
01:41:27,144 --> 01:41:28,576
The memory be green,

1205
01:41:28,712 --> 01:41:32,250
Yet so far hath discretion
fought with nature

1206
01:41:32,385 --> 01:41:35,583
That we with wisest sorrow
think on him,

1207
01:41:35,718 --> 01:41:37,620
Together with remembrance
of ourselves.

1208
01:41:37,756 --> 01:41:39,792
I will not stay a minute longer
to be a part of this jest.

1209
01:41:39,928 --> 01:41:41,557
- Wait. One moment.
- No.

1210
01:41:41,692 --> 01:41:43,628
- I want to go home.
-...my cousin Hamlet,

1211
01:41:43,764 --> 01:41:45,626
and my son...

1212
01:41:49,568 --> 01:41:52,095
How is it that the clouds
still hang on you?

1213
01:41:52,230 --> 01:41:55,403
Good Hamlet,
cast thy nighted color off.

1214
01:41:55,539 --> 01:41:58,440
Do not for ever
with thy vailed lids

1215
01:41:58,576 --> 01:42:01,845
Seek for thy noble father
in the dust.

1216
01:42:01,981 --> 01:42:04,643
All that lives must die,

1217
01:42:04,779 --> 01:42:07,851
Passing through nature
to eternity.

1218
01:42:07,987 --> 01:42:10,585
Ay, madam, it is common.

1219
01:42:11,721 --> 01:42:14,425
But I have that within
which passes show.

1220
01:42:14,561 --> 01:42:17,361
These are but the trappings
and the suits of woe.

1221
01:42:17,496 --> 01:42:20,593
To persevere
In obstinate condolement

1222
01:42:20,729 --> 01:42:23,802
is a course
of impious stubbornness.

1223
01:42:23,938 --> 01:42:26,435
'Tis unmanly grief.

1224
01:42:26,571 --> 01:42:29,571
It shows a will
most incorrect to heaven.

1225
01:42:49,622 --> 01:42:51,296
Oh.

1226
01:42:54,302 --> 01:42:59,401
This too, too solid flesh
would melt,

1227
01:42:59,537 --> 01:43:02,703
Thaw and resolve itself
into a dew.

1228
01:43:03,673 --> 01:43:05,374
Or that the Everlasting
had not fixed

1229
01:43:05,510 --> 01:43:07,807
His canon
gainst self-slaughter.

1230
01:43:09,648 --> 01:43:12,351
'Tis an unweeded garden
That grows to seed;

1231
01:43:12,486 --> 01:43:16,255
things rank and gross in nature
Possess it merely.

1232
01:43:17,816 --> 01:43:20,391
That it should come to this.

1233
01:43:23,029 --> 01:43:25,062
But two months dead--

1234
01:43:25,197 --> 01:43:27,495
nay, not so much, not two--

1235
01:43:27,631 --> 01:43:30,561
So excellent a king,
that was to this

1236
01:43:30,697 --> 01:43:34,366
Hyperion to a... a satyr.

1237
01:43:41,642 --> 01:43:43,708
Whither wilt thou lead me?

1238
01:43:43,843 --> 01:43:46,549
Speak. I'll go no further.

1239
01:43:47,847 --> 01:43:50,212
I am thy father's spirit,

1240
01:43:50,348 --> 01:43:52,653
Doomed for a certain term
to walk the night,

1241
01:43:52,789 --> 01:43:56,125
And for the day confined
to fast in fires.

1242
01:43:56,260 --> 01:43:58,022
My hour is almost come

1243
01:43:58,157 --> 01:44:00,261
When I to sulfurous
and tormenting flames

1244
01:44:00,396 --> 01:44:01,728
Must render up myself.

1245
01:44:01,864 --> 01:44:04,633
- Alas, poor ghost.
- No, pity me not...

1246
01:44:06,100 --> 01:44:09,201
...but lend thy serious hearing
To what I shall unfold.

1247
01:44:09,336 --> 01:44:10,936
List.

1248
01:44:12,175 --> 01:44:13,443
List, oh, list.

1249
01:44:13,578 --> 01:44:15,638
If thou didst ever
thy father love...

1250
01:44:15,773 --> 01:44:17,140
Oh, God.

1251
01:44:17,275 --> 01:44:19,417
But soft, methinks
I scent the morning air.

1252
01:44:19,553 --> 01:44:23,452
Brief let me be.
Sleeping within my orchard.

1253
01:44:23,588 --> 01:44:26,918
Upon my secure hour,
thy uncle stole

1254
01:44:27,054 --> 01:44:28,953
With juice of cursed hebona
in a vile,

1255
01:44:29,089 --> 01:44:31,721
Within the porches
of my ears did pour

1256
01:44:31,857 --> 01:44:34,091
The leprous distillment...

1257
01:44:36,099 --> 01:44:39,800
...whose effect Holds such
an enmity with blood of man

1258
01:44:39,936 --> 01:44:43,639
That swift as quicksilver
it courses through

1259
01:44:43,774 --> 01:44:47,610
The natural gates and alleys
of the body.

1260
01:44:49,745 --> 01:44:51,740
And with a sudden vigor
it doth posset

1261
01:44:51,875 --> 01:44:53,442
And curd, like...

1262
01:44:55,013 --> 01:44:56,450
...eager droppings into milk,

1263
01:44:56,586 --> 01:44:58,757
The thin and wholesome blood.

1264
01:44:58,892 --> 01:45:00,418
So did it mine.

1265
01:45:03,254 --> 01:45:06,299
A most instant tetter
barked about...

1266
01:45:07,767 --> 01:45:11,870
...Most lazar-like,
with vile and loathsome crust,

1267
01:45:12,006 --> 01:45:14,604
All my smooth body.

1268
01:45:19,243 --> 01:45:22,447
Oh, horrible.

1269
01:45:25,075 --> 01:45:27,276
Oh, horrible. Most horrible.

1270
01:45:27,411 --> 01:45:30,014
If thou hast nature in thee,
bear it not...

1271
01:45:30,149 --> 01:45:32,655
He has swapped places
with our son.

1272
01:45:35,559 --> 01:45:37,429
Look at me.

1273
01:45:44,003 --> 01:45:45,833
Look at me.

1274
01:46:23,875 --> 01:46:28,370
The... the glowworm shows
the matin to be near,

1275
01:46:28,506 --> 01:46:32,143
And 'gins to pale
his uneffectual fires.

1276
01:46:52,898 --> 01:46:54,770
My boy.

1277
01:47:01,211 --> 01:47:02,811
Adieu.

1278
01:47:07,954 --> 01:47:09,554
Adieu.

1279
01:47:14,191 --> 01:47:15,428
Adieu.

1280
01:47:25,405 --> 01:47:26,938
Remember me.

1281
01:48:38,302 --> 01:48:41,377
To be, or not to be,

1282
01:48:41,512 --> 01:48:43,781
that is the question.

1283
01:48:43,916 --> 01:48:45,342
Whether 'tis nobler
in the mind to suffer

1284
01:48:45,478 --> 01:48:48,146
The slings and arrows
of outrageous fortune,

1285
01:48:48,282 --> 01:48:50,717
Or to take arms
against a sea of troubles

1286
01:48:50,852 --> 01:48:53,152
And, by opposing, end them.

1287
01:48:54,084 --> 01:48:56,718
To die, to sleep,

1288
01:48:56,854 --> 01:48:58,054
No more.

1289
01:48:58,190 --> 01:49:00,291
And by a sleep, to say we end

1290
01:49:00,426 --> 01:49:02,733
The heartache
and the thousand natural shocks

1291
01:49:02,869 --> 01:49:05,533
That flesh is heir to--
'tis a consummation

1292
01:49:05,668 --> 01:49:07,705
Devoutly to be wished.

1293
01:49:09,834 --> 01:49:11,203
To die,

1294
01:49:11,338 --> 01:49:13,035
To sleep, perchance to dream.

1295
01:49:13,171 --> 01:49:15,241
Ay, there's the rub.

1296
01:49:15,376 --> 01:49:17,748
For in that sleep of death,
what dreams may come

1297
01:49:17,883 --> 01:49:19,876
When we have shuffled
off this mortal coil

1298
01:49:20,012 --> 01:49:22,583
Must give us pause.

1299
01:49:22,719 --> 01:49:23,918
There's the respect

1300
01:49:24,053 --> 01:49:28,055
That makes calamity
of so long life.

1301
01:49:28,190 --> 01:49:30,921
Who would bear
the whips and scorns of time,

1302
01:49:31,057 --> 01:49:32,455
The oppressor's wrong,

1303
01:49:32,590 --> 01:49:34,766
the proud man's contumely,

1304
01:49:34,901 --> 01:49:39,163
The pangs of despised love,
the law's delay,

1305
01:49:39,299 --> 01:49:41,068
The insolence of office,
and the spurns

1306
01:49:41,203 --> 01:49:43,432
That patient merit
of the unworthy take,

1307
01:49:43,568 --> 01:49:45,572
When he himself might
his quietus make

1308
01:49:45,708 --> 01:49:46,738
With a bare bodkin?

1309
01:49:46,874 --> 01:49:48,404
Who would fardels bear,

1310
01:49:48,540 --> 01:49:50,880
To grunt and sweat
under a weary life,

1311
01:49:51,016 --> 01:49:53,848
But that the dread
of something after death,

1312
01:49:53,984 --> 01:49:56,016
The undiscovered country
from whose bourn

1313
01:49:56,152 --> 01:49:58,921
No traveler returns,
puzzles the will,

1314
01:49:59,057 --> 01:50:01,290
And makes us
rather bear those ills...

1315
01:50:17,103 --> 01:50:18,677
En garde!

1316
01:50:42,566 --> 01:50:43,732
One!

1317
01:50:43,867 --> 01:50:46,232
No! No!

1318
01:50:47,707 --> 01:50:49,573
A hit, a palpable hit!

1319
01:50:49,709 --> 01:50:52,167
Our son shall win!

1320
01:50:52,303 --> 01:50:53,479
Well, again!

1321
01:50:53,614 --> 01:50:55,080
Gertrude, do not drink.

1322
01:51:14,529 --> 01:51:16,702
Another hit! What say you?

1323
01:51:25,110 --> 01:51:27,807
Have at you now!

1324
01:51:55,200 --> 01:51:57,871
How does the queen?

1325
01:51:58,007 --> 01:51:59,367
She swoons to see them bleed.

1326
01:51:59,503 --> 01:52:03,039
No, no, the drink, the drink!

1327
01:52:03,175 --> 01:52:05,249
Oh, my dear Hamlet.

1328
01:52:05,385 --> 01:52:06,910
I am poisoned.

1329
01:52:08,522 --> 01:52:11,489
Oh, villainy!

1330
01:52:11,624 --> 01:52:14,215
Ho, let the door be locked!

1331
01:52:14,351 --> 01:52:16,253
Treachery! Seek it out!

1332
01:52:16,389 --> 01:52:17,721
It is here, Hamlet.

1333
01:52:20,225 --> 01:52:22,129
Hamlet, thou art slain.

1334
01:52:22,265 --> 01:52:24,562
No medicine in the world
can do thee good.

1335
01:52:24,697 --> 01:52:27,031
In thee, there is not
half an hour's life.

1336
01:52:27,167 --> 01:52:28,569
The king's to blame!

1337
01:52:31,875 --> 01:52:33,411
The point envenomed, too?

1338
01:52:33,547 --> 01:52:35,275
Then, venom, to thy work!

1339
01:52:46,157 --> 01:52:51,857
Here, thou incestuous,
murderous, damned Dane!

1340
01:52:53,865 --> 01:52:55,466
Drink...

1341
01:52:55,601 --> 01:52:57,931
Drink off this potion!

1342
01:53:00,033 --> 01:53:01,735
Is thy union here?

1343
01:53:01,870 --> 01:53:05,041
Follow my mother.

1344
01:53:31,932 --> 01:53:33,261
I am dead.

1345
01:53:36,673 --> 01:53:38,272
Thou livest.

1346
01:53:39,405 --> 01:53:41,478
Report me and my cause aright

1347
01:53:41,614 --> 01:53:43,475
To the unsatisfied.

1348
01:53:43,610 --> 01:53:45,442
If thou didst ever
hold me in thy heart,

1349
01:53:45,578 --> 01:53:47,820
Absent thee
from felicity awhile,

1350
01:53:47,955 --> 01:53:52,016
And in this harsh world
draw thy breath in pain

1351
01:53:52,151 --> 01:53:54,189
To tell my story.

1352
01:54:12,140 --> 01:54:15,177
I die!

1353
01:54:23,882 --> 01:54:27,853
The potent poison
quite o'ercrows my spirit.

1354
01:55:45,235 --> 01:55:48,006
The rest is silence.
