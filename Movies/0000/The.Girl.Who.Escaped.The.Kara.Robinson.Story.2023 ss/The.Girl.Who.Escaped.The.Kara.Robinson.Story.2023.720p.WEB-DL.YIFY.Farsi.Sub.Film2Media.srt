1
00:00:55,082 --> 00:00:56,301
You up?

2
00:00:56,388 --> 00:00:58,085
What time is it?

3
00:01:01,959 --> 00:01:03,308
Uh, late.

4
00:01:03,438 --> 00:01:05,179
Oh, yeah, I
guess I am up.

5
00:01:08,922 --> 00:01:09,880
Oh.

6
00:01:12,099 --> 00:01:14,536
Uh, the lake's gonna
be so good today.

7
00:01:14,624 --> 00:01:18,105
Yeah...yeah.

8
00:01:18,236 --> 00:01:19,890
Don't worry
about Amber.

9
00:01:20,020 --> 00:01:22,196
She likes you better.

10
00:01:22,327 --> 00:01:23,981
No, she doesn't.

11
00:01:28,202 --> 00:01:29,551
I'll just be you.

12
00:01:29,639 --> 00:01:32,119
She likes you, too.

13
00:01:32,206 --> 00:01:33,860
She actually does.

14
00:01:33,946 --> 00:01:35,079
Plus, I'm gonna
be there as well.

15
00:01:35,166 --> 00:01:36,297
It'll be fine.

16
00:01:37,864 --> 00:01:38,996
I need to wear
this though.

17
00:01:39,083 --> 00:01:40,779
Stop taking
my clothes.

18
00:01:40,867 --> 00:01:43,870
Okay, mom.Oh My god,
get up, let's go eat.

19
00:01:50,181 --> 00:01:52,009
Thank you, got you.

20
00:01:53,314 --> 00:01:56,317
Um, I'm just gonna
call my mom real quick.

21
00:01:58,189 --> 00:01:59,669
Okay.

22
00:02:09,374 --> 00:02:10,897
Debra Johnson.

23
00:02:10,984 --> 00:02:12,203
Hi Mama.

24
00:02:12,333 --> 00:02:14,640
Oh good, Kara, it's just you.

25
00:02:14,727 --> 00:02:16,555
I got scared I forgot a meeting.

26
00:02:16,641 --> 00:02:18,122
Um, cool.

27
00:02:18,209 --> 00:02:19,776
I just wanted to tell you really
quickly that Jess and I are

28
00:02:19,906 --> 00:02:21,516
gonna go over to Amber
Stole's lake house,

29
00:02:21,647 --> 00:02:23,867
and I'll probably be back
by, like, ten or ten thirty.

30
00:02:23,954 --> 00:02:25,172
Hey, is the whole
gang there?

31
00:02:25,303 --> 00:02:26,652
Is Ryan going with you?

32
00:02:26,739 --> 00:02:28,262
No, he's got practice all day.

33
00:02:28,349 --> 00:02:30,003
Oh, that's a shame.

34
00:02:30,090 --> 00:02:32,266
What a waste of a beautiful day.

35
00:02:32,397 --> 00:02:35,182
Wish I could be at
the lake myself.

36
00:02:35,313 --> 00:02:38,403
Um, I also just wanted to remind
you that I'm gonna go over to

37
00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:40,057
Dad's really early on Saturday.

38
00:02:40,144 --> 00:02:42,102
What? Why?

39
00:02:42,189 --> 00:02:44,322
Just so, like, Katie and Jess
and I can go see a movie.

40
00:02:44,409 --> 00:02:46,280
And Dad's just gonna pick us
up, so Jess will drop me off

41
00:02:46,367 --> 00:02:47,978
afterwards and
it'll be no biggie.

42
00:02:48,065 --> 00:02:50,371
Oh right, of course, I...

43
00:02:50,458 --> 00:02:52,591
Would you rather
I didn't do that?

44
00:02:52,678 --> 00:02:54,158
No, no, no, no, it's fine.

45
00:02:54,288 --> 00:02:55,725
Don't worry about it.

46
00:02:55,812 --> 00:02:58,075
You have a good time today.

47
00:02:58,205 --> 00:03:03,863
When you get home tonight, if
I'm not there, don't wait up.

48
00:03:03,950 --> 00:03:05,735
I have a date.

49
00:03:05,865 --> 00:03:07,258
And you can tell
your father that.

50
00:03:08,607 --> 00:03:11,088
Okay, sounds good.

51
00:03:11,175 --> 00:03:12,698
I love you.
Bye Mama.

52
00:03:12,785 --> 00:03:14,613
Love you, too.
Bye.

53
00:03:20,184 --> 00:03:23,013
Yes.Um, my mom did say we
have to water the plants,

54
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:25,015
but then we can go.

55
00:03:25,102 --> 00:03:25,842
Okay, good to go then?

56
00:03:25,972 --> 00:03:27,278
I have to take a shower.

57
00:03:28,801 --> 00:03:30,281
Okay, go shower.

58
00:03:30,368 --> 00:03:31,848
Do you want me to
water the plants?Mm-hmm.

59
00:03:31,978 --> 00:03:32,936
Okay, I'll do it.

60
00:03:33,066 --> 00:03:34,328
Is it front yard
and back yard?Mm-hmm.

61
00:03:34,459 --> 00:03:35,677
I'll do it.Thank you, you're
the best.

62
00:03:35,808 --> 00:03:36,853
See you in 15.

63
00:04:23,290 --> 00:04:24,161
Hi there.

64
00:04:24,291 --> 00:04:25,553
Hi.

65
00:04:25,684 --> 00:04:26,685
Are your parents home?

66
00:04:26,772 --> 00:04:27,947
No, actually this
isn't my house.

67
00:04:28,034 --> 00:04:29,296
This is my
friend's house.

68
00:04:29,382 --> 00:04:32,343
Okay, um, what about her
parents, are her parents home?

69
00:04:32,430 --> 00:04:34,084
No, her mom's
not home.

70
00:04:34,171 --> 00:04:36,826
Ah, can you just hold
onto these for me?Oh yeah, sure.

71
00:04:36,913 --> 00:04:38,305
Good.

72
00:04:39,959 --> 00:04:42,309
If you scream,
I'm gonna shoot you.

73
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:44,877
You're gonna
come with me.

74
00:04:44,964 --> 00:04:46,096
Let's go.

75
00:04:49,664 --> 00:04:50,535
Stay there.

76
00:04:52,363 --> 00:04:54,104
Get in the
container now!

77
00:05:02,895 --> 00:05:04,462
Get your head down.

78
00:05:04,592 --> 00:05:05,767
Don't you say a word.

79
00:05:51,509 --> 00:05:53,598
Five seven two nine
one eight dash B.

80
00:05:53,728 --> 00:05:55,774
Five seven two nine one
eight dash B.

81
00:05:55,861 --> 00:05:58,603
Five seven two nine
one eight dash B.

82
00:06:00,779 --> 00:06:01,780
Okay, let's go.

83
00:06:10,136 --> 00:06:11,572
Now who's not
ready to go?

84
00:06:13,923 --> 00:06:15,054
Kara!

85
00:06:19,145 --> 00:06:21,191
Those plants are getting
a better shower than me.

86
00:06:26,631 --> 00:06:28,241
Where are you?

87
00:06:39,774 --> 00:06:42,821
Kara! Kara!

88
00:07:12,982 --> 00:07:14,070
Sit up.

89
00:07:20,206 --> 00:07:22,078
I'm gonna restrain you.

90
00:07:22,208 --> 00:07:25,081
I'm gonna tie you up at the
wrists and your ankles.

91
00:07:25,211 --> 00:07:27,953
I'm gonna gag you.

92
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:30,738
And I will always
have this gun on me.

93
00:07:30,825 --> 00:07:32,740
Do not make me use it.

94
00:07:35,352 --> 00:07:37,006
Okay.

95
00:07:38,137 --> 00:07:39,878
Don't move.

96
00:07:54,197 --> 00:07:55,111
Escape.

97
00:08:19,091 --> 00:08:20,701
No!

98
00:08:22,529 --> 00:08:23,617
Wait.

99
00:08:30,581 --> 00:08:31,582
Wrists.

100
00:08:44,856 --> 00:08:45,596
Open your mouth.

101
00:08:52,951 --> 00:08:55,780
Lie back, sit back.

102
00:08:58,391 --> 00:08:59,958
Put your feet out
in front of you.

103
00:09:56,754 --> 00:09:58,059
Debra Johnson.

104
00:09:58,190 --> 00:10:00,540
Mrs. Debra, did you
come to pick up Kara?

105
00:10:00,627 --> 00:10:02,151
Jess?

106
00:10:02,281 --> 00:10:05,110
You came to get her, right,
for some, some emergency?

107
00:10:05,197 --> 00:10:06,764
What?

108
00:10:06,894 --> 00:10:08,940
I thought the two of you were
going to the lake together.

109
00:10:09,027 --> 00:10:10,855
Kara's not here.

110
00:10:10,942 --> 00:10:11,943
What are you talking about?

111
00:10:12,073 --> 00:10:13,336
I just spoke to her.

112
00:10:13,423 --> 00:10:15,729
But not to come pick her up?

113
00:10:15,816 --> 00:10:18,906
Jess, where is Kara?

114
00:10:27,437 --> 00:10:28,916
I'm gonna take you
out of the car now

115
00:10:29,003 --> 00:10:31,092
and you're not gonna
make any noise.

116
00:10:31,223 --> 00:10:33,269
I still have my gun.

117
00:10:38,448 --> 00:10:39,753
Where is it? Where is it?

118
00:10:42,669 --> 00:10:44,236
Ryan, Ryan.

119
00:10:51,243 --> 00:10:52,375
Hello.

120
00:10:52,462 --> 00:10:53,985
Ryan, is Kara with you?

121
00:10:54,072 --> 00:10:55,073
Miss Johnson?

122
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:56,335
Is Kara there?

123
00:10:56,465 --> 00:10:57,815
She's at Jess's.

124
00:10:57,902 --> 00:10:59,382
Though they might have
already left for the lake.

125
00:10:59,512 --> 00:11:00,992
I'm sure she'll give you call
whenever they get there.

126
00:11:01,079 --> 00:11:03,168
Ryan, Kara has gone
missing from Jess's.

127
00:11:03,255 --> 00:11:05,126
I'm on my way over there now.

128
00:11:05,257 --> 00:11:06,650
Missing?

129
00:11:06,737 --> 00:11:07,912
I got to call the police.

130
00:11:07,999 --> 00:11:09,043
Miss Johnson, Miss Johnson.

131
00:11:17,095 --> 00:11:18,575
Sit up.

132
00:11:24,058 --> 00:11:26,757
I'm gonna take off
all your restraints,

133
00:11:26,844 --> 00:11:29,412
and you're
gonna get out.

134
00:11:29,499 --> 00:11:33,677
And I might take the gag out
if you promise not to scream,

135
00:11:33,807 --> 00:11:36,114
yell, or be loud.

136
00:11:36,201 --> 00:11:38,812
Hmm?

137
00:11:38,899 --> 00:11:40,597
Shhh.

138
00:12:00,921 --> 00:12:01,835
Feet.

139
00:12:12,281 --> 00:12:13,630
Come with me.

140
00:12:21,681 --> 00:12:22,639
Straight ahead.

141
00:12:29,950 --> 00:12:31,387
In.

142
00:12:31,474 --> 00:12:33,214
Stand by the bed
and face me.

143
00:12:41,135 --> 00:12:44,051
I'm gonna lay out the rules
for while you're here now.

144
00:12:44,182 --> 00:12:47,272
One, I will always
have this gun,

145
00:12:47,403 --> 00:12:50,144
or some other
weapon nearby.

146
00:12:50,275 --> 00:12:56,934
Two, you will always
call me daddy.

147
00:12:57,064 --> 00:13:00,285
Three, you will listen
to everything I say

148
00:13:00,372 --> 00:13:03,810
and do everything that
I tell you to do.

149
00:13:03,897 --> 00:13:07,292
If you want anything, you'll
have to ask for permission.

150
00:13:07,423 --> 00:13:11,688
And most important, if you
break any of the rules,

151
00:13:11,775 --> 00:13:16,170
there will be
consequences, understood?

152
00:13:19,826 --> 00:13:21,524
Understood?!

153
00:13:21,611 --> 00:13:22,699
Yes.

154
00:13:24,309 --> 00:13:25,919
Yes, daddy.

155
00:13:31,316 --> 00:13:32,578
Sit down.

156
00:13:46,940 --> 00:13:49,290
What's your name?

157
00:13:49,421 --> 00:13:51,945
Kara.

158
00:13:52,076 --> 00:13:53,947
Last name.

159
00:13:54,034 --> 00:13:56,340
Robinson.

160
00:13:56,428 --> 00:13:58,561
How old are you,
Kara Robinson?

161
00:14:00,867 --> 00:14:02,826
I'm 15.

162
00:14:05,959 --> 00:14:07,308
Where do you live?

163
00:14:07,396 --> 00:14:12,052
I just live in Lexington.

164
00:14:12,183 --> 00:14:15,882
Two-two-zero Willow
Spring Road.

165
00:14:15,969 --> 00:14:17,928
Who else lives there?

166
00:14:18,058 --> 00:14:19,799
Just my Mom.

167
00:14:19,930 --> 00:14:21,888
What's her name?

168
00:14:21,975 --> 00:14:24,891
My mom's name's Debra.

169
00:14:24,978 --> 00:14:28,939
What about your dad?

170
00:14:29,026 --> 00:14:32,943
Um, they're separated, so.

171
00:14:33,030 --> 00:14:38,601
Oh, that can be so
hard on the child.

172
00:14:38,688 --> 00:14:41,995
Then again, sometimes it's
for the best, isn't it?

173
00:14:42,126 --> 00:14:44,345
What's his name?

174
00:14:44,433 --> 00:14:47,697
Ron.

175
00:14:47,784 --> 00:14:50,221
Where does he live?

176
00:14:50,351 --> 00:14:53,920
Eighty-one Elm Lane.

177
00:14:54,007 --> 00:14:56,183
Your friend whose house you
were at, what's her name?

178
00:14:56,270 --> 00:14:57,837
Jess.

179
00:14:57,968 --> 00:15:00,274
Jess.

180
00:15:00,361 --> 00:15:01,798
Do you have a
boyfriend?

181
00:15:07,673 --> 00:15:09,066
Yeah.

182
00:15:09,153 --> 00:15:10,676
And what's his name?

183
00:15:15,986 --> 00:15:17,204
Ryan.

184
00:15:17,335 --> 00:15:20,817
Ryan.

185
00:15:20,947 --> 00:15:23,602
How long have
you been dating?

186
00:15:23,689 --> 00:15:25,865
About a year.

187
00:15:25,952 --> 00:15:28,128
About a year.

188
00:15:28,215 --> 00:15:29,826
Have you had
sex with Ryan?

189
00:15:40,314 --> 00:15:42,403
No.

190
00:15:42,491 --> 00:15:44,840
Have you had sex
with anyone else?

191
00:15:44,971 --> 00:15:47,104
No.

192
00:15:47,191 --> 00:15:50,542
What about oral sex, or have you
done things with your hands?

193
00:15:56,374 --> 00:15:58,594
Are you in love
with Ryan?

194
00:15:58,724 --> 00:16:01,031
Yeah.

195
00:16:01,118 --> 00:16:03,033
Wow, so that's what
makes him real.

196
00:16:05,905 --> 00:16:07,080
Do you love Jess?

197
00:16:07,211 --> 00:16:08,952
Yeah.

198
00:16:09,039 --> 00:16:10,736
Do you love your
mom and dad?

199
00:16:10,867 --> 00:16:11,781
Yeah.

200
00:16:14,087 --> 00:16:16,263
Do you think
they miss you?

201
00:16:23,923 --> 00:16:25,098
Lay down on the bed.

202
00:16:29,842 --> 00:16:30,887
Do it!

203
00:16:38,503 --> 00:16:39,765
Be quiet.

204
00:16:42,376 --> 00:16:43,900
Follow the rules.

205
00:16:46,729 --> 00:16:48,948
Wait.

206
00:16:49,035 --> 00:16:50,254
Survive.

207
00:17:00,438 --> 00:17:01,831
Gather information.

208
00:17:08,925 --> 00:17:09,794
Get in.

209
00:17:13,755 --> 00:17:14,669
Hello.

210
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:16,496
Rob.

211
00:17:16,628 --> 00:17:18,412
Debra.

212
00:17:18,499 --> 00:17:20,893
Look, I, I told Kara she could
contact me if she needed me,

213
00:17:21,023 --> 00:17:23,678
but I, I thought we agreed you
just tell her what you need

214
00:17:23,809 --> 00:17:24,897
to tell me, okay.

215
00:17:24,984 --> 00:17:27,072
So, Kara's not there with you?

216
00:17:27,204 --> 00:17:29,336
Debra, why would she be with me?

217
00:17:29,423 --> 00:17:31,991
I'm five hours away
and I'm working.

218
00:17:32,122 --> 00:17:33,906
What's going on?

219
00:17:34,037 --> 00:17:36,039
Kara's gone missing.

220
00:17:36,169 --> 00:17:37,736
What do you mean?

221
00:17:37,823 --> 00:17:39,042
She's missing, Ron.

222
00:17:39,129 --> 00:17:41,131
She disappeared
from Jess's yard.

223
00:17:41,261 --> 00:17:42,523
Somebody...

224
00:17:42,611 --> 00:17:44,264
Oh god.

225
00:17:44,351 --> 00:17:45,526
...somebody must have taken her.

226
00:17:45,657 --> 00:17:47,224
Oh, my god.

227
00:17:47,311 --> 00:17:48,921
Look, okay, I'm come, I'm
coming back right away.

228
00:17:49,008 --> 00:17:50,140
I'll come right there.

229
00:17:50,227 --> 00:17:51,968
Okay, I'll, I'll see you soon.

230
00:17:52,098 --> 00:17:53,012
Okay.

231
00:18:08,375 --> 00:18:10,073
And about how long did
you say she's been gone?

232
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:14,425
Missing, she's been missing
for about two hours now.

233
00:18:14,555 --> 00:18:15,644
And you didn't
hear anything?

234
00:18:15,731 --> 00:18:17,036
No.

235
00:18:17,167 --> 00:18:18,734
Don't you think
she would tell you?

236
00:18:18,821 --> 00:18:21,606
She's answered your questions
multiple times, sir.

237
00:18:21,737 --> 00:18:23,913
Well, ma'am, we'll see if the
neighbors have anything to say.

238
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,045
But chances are, your
girl is a runaway.

239
00:18:26,176 --> 00:18:29,135
My daughter is the
most responsible.Ma'am.

240
00:18:29,222 --> 00:18:32,617
The idea that she would runaway
at all without her, her, her,

241
00:18:32,748 --> 00:18:34,793
her purse, without her
clothes, without her shoes!

242
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:36,665
Kids do dumb
things, ma'am.

243
00:18:36,752 --> 00:18:39,406
Even if she did runaway,
without a thing,

244
00:18:39,493 --> 00:18:44,107
without telling another soul
in this world, she is 15!

245
00:18:44,194 --> 00:18:46,022
You need to find her.

246
00:18:46,109 --> 00:18:48,894
I'm sorry, I will
file this report.

247
00:18:49,025 --> 00:18:50,591
Officers will know
to be on the lookout.

248
00:18:50,679 --> 00:18:52,158
You should go home.

249
00:18:52,245 --> 00:18:53,551
Wait and see
if she calls.

250
00:19:04,693 --> 00:19:09,523
Wait, escape, survive.

251
00:19:16,661 --> 00:19:18,054
You look good
in my shirt.

252
00:19:21,318 --> 00:19:22,841
So, where do you
go to school?

253
00:19:26,758 --> 00:19:28,151
Kenaston High.

254
00:19:29,413 --> 00:19:30,544
Do you like it?

255
00:19:34,548 --> 00:19:37,247
Uh, yeah.

256
00:19:41,555 --> 00:19:42,905
Gather information.

257
00:19:49,389 --> 00:19:51,261
Did you like going
to high school?

258
00:19:54,220 --> 00:19:57,789
Yeah, for the most
part, I guess I did.

259
00:19:57,876 --> 00:20:00,226
It's easy when you're
a good student.

260
00:20:00,313 --> 00:20:02,968
I graduated early.

261
00:20:03,055 --> 00:20:05,144
Oh, you must be
really smart then.

262
00:20:05,231 --> 00:20:06,929
I like to think so.

263
00:20:11,107 --> 00:20:13,283
Did you, like, do
anything after, like,

264
00:20:13,413 --> 00:20:14,893
did you go to
college or anything?

265
00:20:15,024 --> 00:20:17,200
No, too expensive.

266
00:20:17,287 --> 00:20:20,507
I had some part-time jobs
when I was in school,

267
00:20:20,594 --> 00:20:24,468
but nothing saved up.

268
00:20:24,555 --> 00:20:26,078
Actually, I
joined the navy.

269
00:20:26,165 --> 00:20:27,384
Oh, the navy.

270
00:20:27,471 --> 00:20:28,820
Mm-hmm.Yeah, cool.

271
00:20:28,907 --> 00:20:31,214
Nine years.

272
00:20:31,301 --> 00:20:33,651
They wouldn't give me the
promotion I deserved,

273
00:20:33,782 --> 00:20:35,871
but they did give me
a bunch of medals and

274
00:20:36,001 --> 00:20:37,873
an honorable
discharge.

275
00:20:41,659 --> 00:20:42,921
That's impressive.

276
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:53,976
You know I'm not
looking to hurt you.

277
00:20:54,063 --> 00:20:55,542
Not if you don't make me.

278
00:20:59,024 --> 00:21:03,637
I'm gonna let you go
when I'm finished with ya.

279
00:21:03,724 --> 00:21:06,858
Breathe, wait.

280
00:21:40,849 --> 00:21:41,937
Escape.

281
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:44,940
No, no!

282
00:21:47,203 --> 00:21:48,291
Wait.

283
00:21:49,292 --> 00:21:52,948
Have you
smoked before?

284
00:21:53,035 --> 00:21:57,648
Uh, no.

285
00:21:57,735 --> 00:21:59,084
Well you're gonna.

286
00:22:09,355 --> 00:22:12,445
Inhale deep
and hold it.

287
00:22:12,576 --> 00:22:14,317
Come on.

288
00:22:14,404 --> 00:22:15,622
Follow the rules.

289
00:22:27,721 --> 00:22:28,722
That's good.

290
00:22:28,809 --> 00:22:29,898
Go again.

291
00:22:30,028 --> 00:22:31,464
Wait, could
you show me?

292
00:22:31,551 --> 00:22:37,035
Do you have, like, some
kind of, like, technique?

293
00:22:37,122 --> 00:22:38,645
Yeah.

294
00:22:50,005 --> 00:22:52,616
Could you show
me one more time?

295
00:22:56,185 --> 00:23:01,930
Now, Kara, remember
there are rules.

296
00:23:02,060 --> 00:23:05,194
I think you're trying to do
something that you don't

297
00:23:05,324 --> 00:23:06,804
have permission to do.

298
00:23:06,891 --> 00:23:09,415
Uh-uh.Hmm.

299
00:23:09,502 --> 00:23:12,810
And when you break the rules,
there are consequences.

300
00:23:22,689 --> 00:23:27,216
You were so good, Kara, that
you have earned a reward.

301
00:23:40,272 --> 00:23:42,753
How many animals
do you have?

302
00:23:42,883 --> 00:23:45,147
Go see for yourself.

303
00:24:02,729 --> 00:24:04,122
Do you have
a favorite?

304
00:24:04,209 --> 00:24:07,734
Hmm.

305
00:24:07,865 --> 00:24:09,954
Probably Clyde,
the Gray Cockatiel.

306
00:24:10,085 --> 00:24:11,782
I've had him
the longest.

307
00:24:11,912 --> 00:24:14,176
But I like them all, or
they wouldn't be here.

308
00:24:15,699 --> 00:24:17,135
Have you always
liked animals?

309
00:24:17,266 --> 00:24:21,009
I guess so, yeah.

310
00:24:21,139 --> 00:24:23,141
They're easy
to figure out.

311
00:24:23,272 --> 00:24:24,360
Happy to be kept.

312
00:24:28,494 --> 00:24:29,974
Do you work
with animals?

313
00:24:30,061 --> 00:24:33,195
Now that you don't work
in the navy anymore?

314
00:24:33,325 --> 00:24:35,153
No.

315
00:24:35,284 --> 00:24:36,720
I have a boring job.

316
00:24:36,850 --> 00:24:38,243
I work with
air compressors.

317
00:24:38,330 --> 00:24:40,028
Do you like it enough?

318
00:24:40,115 --> 00:24:42,334
Yeah, I like it enough.

319
00:24:42,465 --> 00:24:45,076
Cool.Not as much as the navy,
but all over the country.

320
00:24:45,163 --> 00:24:48,384
Where do you
like to go?

321
00:24:48,471 --> 00:24:52,953
San Diego's nice, especially
since I used to live there.

322
00:24:58,394 --> 00:25:02,224
I am gonna let you
go when I'm done.

323
00:25:06,097 --> 00:25:07,794
But what happens
next is up to you.

324
00:25:10,754 --> 00:25:14,410
If you go and
report me,

325
00:25:14,497 --> 00:25:18,979
you will always be the girl
who was raped, forever.

326
00:25:28,946 --> 00:25:29,903
Sit down.

327
00:25:37,259 --> 00:25:40,827
We are going to
watch this together,

328
00:25:40,958 --> 00:25:43,178
and I want you to
tell me all about it.

329
00:26:08,986 --> 00:26:12,859
Wait.

330
00:26:12,990 --> 00:26:14,687
Escape.

331
00:26:17,908 --> 00:26:19,692
Hi Gretchen, it's Debra.

332
00:26:19,823 --> 00:26:21,781
Yes, Kara's mom.

333
00:26:21,868 --> 00:26:23,131
I got your number from...

334
00:26:24,697 --> 00:26:26,960
Oh, you've heard.

335
00:26:27,091 --> 00:26:31,878
The police said they're not
worried yet, but we, yeah.

336
00:26:31,965 --> 00:26:35,491
We're just trying to get people
out all over to look for her.

337
00:26:35,578 --> 00:26:39,799
Uh, the only thing we have
to go on is a neighbor saw

338
00:26:39,886 --> 00:26:41,888
a black Trans Am.

339
00:26:41,975 --> 00:26:45,414
I'm going to be here by the
phone and you can always, um,

340
00:26:45,544 --> 00:26:49,896
call into the Lexington
Sheriff's Department.

341
00:26:52,769 --> 00:26:53,900
Thank you, Gretchen.

342
00:26:53,987 --> 00:26:55,250
Bye.

343
00:27:18,316 --> 00:27:20,753
May I please go
to the bathroom?

344
00:27:20,884 --> 00:27:23,103
Of course.

345
00:27:33,244 --> 00:27:34,202
Escape.

346
00:27:40,251 --> 00:27:41,296
Go ahead.

347
00:27:59,052 --> 00:28:01,229
Stop.

348
00:28:01,316 --> 00:28:04,057
Ask permission.

349
00:28:04,188 --> 00:28:08,279
May I wash my
hands, please?

350
00:28:08,410 --> 00:28:11,282
Daddy.

351
00:28:11,369 --> 00:28:13,066
Yes, you may.

352
00:28:39,267 --> 00:28:41,747
Sit, I'm making dinner.

353
00:28:41,834 --> 00:28:44,184
You'll have to eat
while you're here.

354
00:28:44,315 --> 00:28:46,752
I understand.

355
00:28:50,539 --> 00:28:52,802
I just, I don't really
feel like eating right now.

356
00:28:56,849 --> 00:28:58,895
Remember there are
consequences if you don't do

357
00:28:59,025 --> 00:28:59,983
what I tell you to.

358
00:29:00,113 --> 00:29:02,028
Okay.

359
00:29:02,115 --> 00:29:06,337
Is there anything that I could
do for you while you're eating?

360
00:29:06,424 --> 00:29:08,600
Yeah, you can sweep the
floor, just the kitchen.

361
00:29:08,731 --> 00:29:10,167
Broom's right there.

362
00:29:56,213 --> 00:29:58,737
Stop.

363
00:29:58,868 --> 00:30:00,043
Take that off.

364
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:07,050
Follow the rules.

365
00:30:11,446 --> 00:30:12,838
A black Trans Am.

366
00:30:12,925 --> 00:30:14,710
That her friend's car?

367
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:17,582
No.

368
00:30:17,669 --> 00:30:22,326
Ma'am, I've got kids of my own,
and I don't think there's ever

369
00:30:22,413 --> 00:30:24,067
been a time where I
knew all their friends,

370
00:30:24,197 --> 00:30:26,809
let alone their
friend's cars.

371
00:30:26,939 --> 00:30:29,942
Do you always know where your
daughter is and who she's with?

372
00:30:30,073 --> 00:30:34,556
No, I don't.

373
00:30:34,686 --> 00:30:37,515
But I do know that Kara would
never go this long without

374
00:30:37,646 --> 00:30:40,649
calling unless something
was keeping her from it.

375
00:30:40,736 --> 00:30:42,738
She's not just
any kid, Sheriff.

376
00:30:44,348 --> 00:30:46,263
Somebody get me
Detective Munro.

377
00:30:48,352 --> 00:30:50,833
It has been
much too long.

378
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:52,835
I'm gonna get my best
people on it, all right?

379
00:30:53,836 --> 00:30:55,359
Thank you.

380
00:30:55,446 --> 00:30:57,056
All right then.

381
00:31:03,062 --> 00:31:05,195
But I need you
to do something.

382
00:31:05,325 --> 00:31:07,632
You've done your job.

383
00:31:07,719 --> 00:31:10,853
I apologize it
took you coming in.

384
00:31:10,983 --> 00:31:14,987
But the best thing you can
do, well, the only thing

385
00:31:15,074 --> 00:31:19,601
you can do really is to go
home and wait for a call.

386
00:31:26,303 --> 00:31:27,130
Sit down.

387
00:31:34,267 --> 00:31:37,967
Let's see if
anyone misses you.

388
00:31:40,535 --> 00:31:42,145
As you said, Bob,
the story is still holding

389
00:31:42,275 --> 00:31:43,929
everyone's attention tonight.

390
00:31:44,060 --> 00:31:46,889
This afternoon, shocking high
speed chase through downtown,

391
00:31:46,976 --> 00:31:48,847
one that may turn deadly,

392
00:31:48,978 --> 00:31:51,284
as one victim
remains in the hospital.

393
00:31:51,415 --> 00:31:54,331
The brown Sedan tore around
the corner of Washington Avenue

394
00:31:54,418 --> 00:31:55,854
and Main Street.

395
00:31:57,377 --> 00:31:59,118
Wow, not the
lead story.

396
00:32:07,866 --> 00:32:12,654
It's sad, really so sad.

397
00:32:14,830 --> 00:32:20,313
I'm gonna let you
go and no one cares.

398
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:26,363
Not Ryan, not Jess,
not your mom and dad.

399
00:32:26,450 --> 00:32:33,239
You loved them so much, and
not a one of them cares.

400
00:32:39,855 --> 00:32:40,899
Get up.

401
00:32:44,381 --> 00:32:46,688
Get up!

402
00:32:51,257 --> 00:32:55,740
Wait, escape, survive.

403
00:32:55,827 --> 00:32:56,872
Uh!

404
00:32:59,918 --> 00:33:00,789
Stand over there.

405
00:33:11,060 --> 00:33:13,453
I need to make
a phone call.

406
00:33:13,584 --> 00:33:15,151
You're gonna get back
in the container,

407
00:33:15,238 --> 00:33:18,023
I'm gonna put the gag
back in your mouth,

408
00:33:18,154 --> 00:33:23,028
and you're gonna stay there
and you're gonna be quiet.

409
00:33:23,159 --> 00:33:25,161
Uhh.

410
00:33:25,291 --> 00:33:27,816
Get in the
container.

411
00:33:27,946 --> 00:33:30,862
Get in!

412
00:33:38,783 --> 00:33:39,915
Open your mouth.

413
00:33:47,618 --> 00:33:48,663
Lean back.

414
00:33:53,842 --> 00:33:57,933
Wait, escape, survive.

415
00:33:58,063 --> 00:34:02,328
Wait, escape,
survive.

416
00:34:02,459 --> 00:34:03,939
Breathe.

417
00:34:04,026 --> 00:34:06,898
Wait, breathe.

418
00:34:06,985 --> 00:34:08,595
Breathe.

419
00:34:09,334 --> 00:34:10,901
I can't breathe.

420
00:34:10,988 --> 00:34:12,774
I can't breathe!

421
00:34:12,903 --> 00:34:14,253
Why are you
making noise?!

422
00:34:14,340 --> 00:34:15,820
Answer me!

423
00:34:15,907 --> 00:34:16,952
I don't know.

424
00:34:17,082 --> 00:34:18,693
What?

425
00:34:18,823 --> 00:34:20,084
I don't know.

426
00:34:20,171 --> 00:34:24,176
Okay, I, I'll leave the lid
off and take the gag out,

427
00:34:24,263 --> 00:34:26,700
as long as
you stay quiet.

428
00:34:26,831 --> 00:34:29,093
Uh-huh.

429
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:36,885
Lie down.

430
00:34:39,017 --> 00:34:41,237
Lie down!

431
00:34:41,367 --> 00:34:44,022
But you have
to be quiet.

432
00:34:44,153 --> 00:34:48,722
Or there will be
real consequences.

433
00:35:05,043 --> 00:35:06,479
Survive.

434
00:35:18,361 --> 00:35:20,058
You were very good
at being quiet.

435
00:35:46,389 --> 00:35:48,652
Anxiety can be
really tough.

436
00:35:48,783 --> 00:35:50,088
I've had it before.

437
00:35:53,918 --> 00:35:54,876
This helps me.

438
00:35:57,356 --> 00:35:59,054
Take it.

439
00:36:14,199 --> 00:36:15,548
Did you
swallow it?

440
00:36:15,635 --> 00:36:17,159
I think so.

441
00:36:17,246 --> 00:36:18,638
Good.

442
00:36:32,217 --> 00:36:37,832
Wait, escape,
information.

443
00:36:42,314 --> 00:36:43,751
Good night.

444
00:36:58,461 --> 00:36:59,331
Time for bed.

445
00:37:21,310 --> 00:37:22,702
Escape!

446
00:37:30,014 --> 00:37:31,189
No, no, no!

447
00:37:33,017 --> 00:37:34,627
Wait.

448
00:37:41,330 --> 00:37:42,331
Ladies first.

449
00:37:53,124 --> 00:37:55,126
And I still got to tie you
up before I go to sleep.

450
00:37:59,304 --> 00:38:01,567
These will help keep you from
getting any stupid ideas.

451
00:38:08,705 --> 00:38:09,749
Wrists.

452
00:38:19,455 --> 00:38:20,760
We have a big
day tomorrow.

453
00:39:45,323 --> 00:39:46,934
Escape.

454
00:40:00,251 --> 00:40:04,952
Come on, go, come on.

455
00:41:51,275 --> 00:41:52,624
Escape!

456
00:42:16,474 --> 00:42:18,346
Hey, hey, hey!

457
00:42:21,827 --> 00:42:22,915
Please, please!

458
00:42:26,136 --> 00:42:27,355
I got kidnapped!

459
00:42:27,485 --> 00:42:29,444
I was kidnapped!

460
00:42:29,531 --> 00:42:30,793
What do you
want us to do?It was that apartment.

461
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:33,012
Could you take me to the
police station, please?

462
00:42:33,143 --> 00:42:34,579
Please.

463
00:42:34,710 --> 00:42:36,190
Get in.Thanks.

464
00:42:39,758 --> 00:42:41,238
It was that apartment.

465
00:42:41,325 --> 00:42:43,588
I need you to remember
that for me, please.

466
00:42:43,675 --> 00:42:44,850
Yeah, okay.

467
00:42:44,981 --> 00:42:46,765
Okay, thank you.

468
00:43:18,057 --> 00:43:20,625
Gotta get justice.

469
00:43:31,419 --> 00:43:33,072
My name is
Kara Robinson.

470
00:43:33,160 --> 00:43:35,292
I was kidnapped
and then I escaped.

471
00:43:35,379 --> 00:43:36,772
Miss Robinson?

472
00:43:36,859 --> 00:43:40,384
Kara,
K-A-R-A R-O-B-I-N-S-O-N.

473
00:43:40,471 --> 00:43:41,777
I think you should
write that there.

474
00:43:43,039 --> 00:43:44,040
I thought it'd
be more...I was kidnapped
and then I escaped.

475
00:43:45,824 --> 00:43:47,086
Have a seat,
Miss Robinson.

476
00:43:47,174 --> 00:43:48,262
Just in those
chairs over there.

477
00:43:48,349 --> 00:43:49,828
Okay.

478
00:44:02,885 --> 00:44:04,452
Miss.
Hi, your name.

479
00:44:04,539 --> 00:44:05,975
Kara.

480
00:44:06,062 --> 00:44:07,542
Hi Kara.

481
00:44:10,893 --> 00:44:12,590
Um, may I?

482
00:44:12,677 --> 00:44:14,636
Yeah.

483
00:44:14,723 --> 00:44:16,333
Kara, my name's
Lieutenant Rowland.

484
00:44:16,464 --> 00:44:19,075
You can call
me Aaron.Okay.

485
00:44:19,162 --> 00:44:20,859
May I ask
what's happened?

486
00:44:20,946 --> 00:44:24,036
I was kidnapped yesterday
by a man, white,

487
00:44:24,167 --> 00:44:27,736
medium build with brown hair,
with a gun yesterday morning,

488
00:44:27,866 --> 00:44:33,437
and then I, um, he
raped me multiple times,

489
00:44:33,524 --> 00:44:37,006
and then I escaped this
morning while he was asleep,

490
00:44:37,093 --> 00:44:38,921
in those handcuffs
and this.

491
00:44:39,051 --> 00:44:40,662
Okay.

492
00:44:40,749 --> 00:44:42,881
Um, how, how did
you get here?

493
00:44:42,968 --> 00:44:45,797
I stopped a couple of
men, big men, like,

494
00:44:45,928 --> 00:44:47,538
in the car and they
drove me over here.

495
00:44:47,625 --> 00:44:49,323
Kara, I'm gonna have a
word with the Corporal,

496
00:44:49,410 --> 00:44:51,803
and then I would like to hear
everything you can remember,

497
00:44:51,934 --> 00:44:53,327
if that's all
right with you.Yeah.

498
00:44:53,414 --> 00:44:54,719
Are you comfortable
coming in my office?Mm-hmm.

499
00:44:54,850 --> 00:44:56,155
Okay, follow me.Okay.

500
00:44:59,594 --> 00:45:01,117
Okay, have a seat,
I'll be right in.Okay.

501
00:45:03,075 --> 00:45:04,425
Get another
Inspector in here.

502
00:45:04,512 --> 00:45:07,036
I need a missing person's
report for Kara Robinson and

503
00:45:07,166 --> 00:45:09,604
the drivers interviewed,
and update the Sheriff.

504
00:45:14,391 --> 00:45:15,827
Okay, Kara, thank
you for waiting.

505
00:45:18,221 --> 00:45:19,918
Can you start at
the beginning?

506
00:45:20,005 --> 00:45:21,398
Excuse me,
gentlemen.

507
00:45:21,529 --> 00:45:23,879
Hi, hi, did you bring a girl
into the station just now?

508
00:45:24,009 --> 00:45:25,881
Yeah, is she okay?

509
00:45:25,968 --> 00:45:27,317
We have to go
to work, but.

510
00:45:27,448 --> 00:45:29,014
We're taking care
of her, don't worry.

511
00:45:29,145 --> 00:45:30,189
We just need to
know where exactly

512
00:45:30,277 --> 00:45:32,017
did you pick
her up from.

513
00:45:32,148 --> 00:45:35,673
The Beachwood
Commons Apartments,

514
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:37,545
right off the
20/26 exchange.

515
00:45:37,632 --> 00:45:38,763
Great.

516
00:45:38,894 --> 00:45:40,243
And can you tell
me which unit?

517
00:45:40,374 --> 00:45:42,898
We can't remember.

518
00:45:43,028 --> 00:45:45,117
I mean it was just a girl
coming out of nowhere.

519
00:45:45,204 --> 00:45:47,032
It's all right.

520
00:45:47,163 --> 00:45:49,905
I got off the bed, so I
could put my shorts back on,

521
00:45:50,035 --> 00:45:52,647
and then I saw that
there was this big, like,

522
00:45:52,777 --> 00:45:54,910
lock thing on the door, and I
knew it was gonna make a bunch

523
00:45:55,040 --> 00:45:58,479
of noise, so I just opened
it as quick as I could,

524
00:45:58,609 --> 00:46:01,264
and then I ran, and then I saw
the guys in the car, like,

525
00:46:01,351 --> 00:46:03,919
waved them down.

526
00:46:04,049 --> 00:46:05,616
I, I just talked to them.

527
00:46:05,747 --> 00:46:07,705
Sergeant Bonnie Jennings.

528
00:46:07,836 --> 00:46:09,620
I'm gonna be working with
Lieutenant Rowland

529
00:46:09,707 --> 00:46:12,144
here on your case.

530
00:46:12,275 --> 00:46:13,320
I did find this
in the system.

531
00:46:15,104 --> 00:46:19,326
You were first reported
missing almost 18 hours ago.

532
00:46:19,456 --> 00:46:21,937
Debra Johnson,
that's your mother?

533
00:46:22,024 --> 00:46:23,721
Yeah.

534
00:46:34,863 --> 00:46:36,821
Hello.

535
00:46:36,952 --> 00:46:39,650
Miss Johnson, this is Lieutenant
Rowland with the Richland County

536
00:46:39,781 --> 00:46:40,782
Sheriff's Department.

537
00:46:40,869 --> 00:46:42,087
Is it Kara?

538
00:46:42,218 --> 00:46:44,568
Yes, ma'am, we have
your daughter here.

539
00:46:44,699 --> 00:46:46,962
Is she okay?

540
00:46:47,049 --> 00:46:50,269
Mom, Momma can you
come pick me up?

541
00:46:50,357 --> 00:46:52,707
Oh baby.

542
00:46:52,837 --> 00:46:55,405
Baby, I'll, I'll be
right there, okay.

543
00:46:55,492 --> 00:46:57,015
I'm coming right now.

544
00:47:01,455 --> 00:47:03,021
Okay, Mrs. Johnson.

545
00:47:06,503 --> 00:47:08,636
I have a tough
thing to ask, Kara.

546
00:47:08,766 --> 00:47:10,289
Do you think that if we
went back to the complex

547
00:47:10,420 --> 00:47:13,075
you'd be able to
pick out the apartment?

548
00:47:13,162 --> 00:47:16,078
Oh, I asked the people
in the car to remember

549
00:47:16,208 --> 00:47:17,862
what the apartment
number was.

550
00:47:17,993 --> 00:47:20,256
I asked them, and I'm sorry
to say they didn't remember.

551
00:47:20,343 --> 00:47:23,564
I think they were pretty
distracted by the sight of you.

552
00:47:27,306 --> 00:47:29,526
I don't think
I'm gonna remember.

553
00:47:29,613 --> 00:47:32,747
Kara, would you be up
to coming back with us

554
00:47:32,834 --> 00:47:34,226
to give it a
try anyway?

555
00:47:38,927 --> 00:47:40,798
Get justice.

556
00:47:40,929 --> 00:47:43,192
Get him.

557
00:47:43,279 --> 00:47:44,585
Yeah.

558
00:47:48,023 --> 00:47:49,154
I think we're close.

559
00:47:52,854 --> 00:47:53,898
I think this is it.

560
00:48:02,211 --> 00:48:03,647
Anything
looking familiar?

561
00:48:05,997 --> 00:48:14,789
Uh, yeah, I just...it
just looks the same.

562
00:48:14,919 --> 00:48:16,094
Maybe this guy
can help.

563
00:48:22,187 --> 00:48:23,232
Excuse me, sir.

564
00:48:26,757 --> 00:48:28,063
Richland County
sheriffs.

565
00:48:28,150 --> 00:48:29,934
We're looking for the
apartment of a man here.

566
00:48:30,021 --> 00:48:33,677
Mid 30s, Caucasian, brown
hair, about five foot nine.

567
00:48:33,764 --> 00:48:36,985
Uh, sorry, it's
a big complex.

568
00:48:37,072 --> 00:48:40,379
A lot of guys could be that,
especially if you include

569
00:48:40,510 --> 00:48:42,164
boyfriends and
relatives, you know.

570
00:48:42,251 --> 00:48:43,818
Yeah, okay,
thank you.

571
00:48:45,167 --> 00:48:47,256
All of his windows
are covered up.

572
00:48:47,386 --> 00:48:50,433
He's got like a wolf curtain
kind of over his bed,

573
00:48:50,564 --> 00:48:53,305
and he lives with a lady
with long blond hair.

574
00:48:53,436 --> 00:48:55,438
I'm sorry, miss, I...He also had a wall
full of animals.

575
00:48:55,569 --> 00:48:58,789
He had birds, rats, hermit
crabs, guinea pigs,

576
00:48:58,920 --> 00:48:59,964
that type of stuff.

577
00:49:00,095 --> 00:49:01,139
A lot of fish, too.

578
00:49:01,226 --> 00:49:04,316
Oh, yeah, that's
apartment 301, yeah, 301.

579
00:49:04,447 --> 00:49:06,754
Would you mind showing the
Sergeant here to the leasing

580
00:49:06,884 --> 00:49:08,669
office, so we can pull
the info on that unit?

581
00:49:08,756 --> 00:49:09,757
Yeah, sure.

582
00:49:09,887 --> 00:49:10,845
Thank you.

583
00:49:12,455 --> 00:49:13,891
Kara, let's
get you back.

584
00:49:23,074 --> 00:49:24,511
That's great work.

585
00:49:36,044 --> 00:49:37,480
This is
Lieutenant Rowland,

586
00:49:37,611 --> 00:49:41,136
I need a car watching 1532
Slaw Street, apartment 301.

587
00:49:41,223 --> 00:49:44,008
Suspect is considered
armed and dangerous.

588
00:49:44,095 --> 00:49:46,968
Sergeant Jennings is
watching the scene.

589
00:49:47,055 --> 00:49:48,752
Copy that Lieutenant.

590
00:49:48,883 --> 00:49:50,841
We'll put an all points
bulletin ASAP.

591
00:49:50,972 --> 00:49:52,669
Officer please respond.

592
00:49:52,756 --> 00:49:54,018
Officers please-

593
00:49:55,367 --> 00:49:57,892
Kara, where is she?Ma'am?

594
00:49:58,022 --> 00:50:00,242
Kara Robinson.Mrs. Johnson.

595
00:50:00,329 --> 00:50:02,374
Yes, you called me.

596
00:50:02,461 --> 00:50:04,202
You called me to tell
me that she's here.

597
00:50:04,289 --> 00:50:05,943
What and,
and she's not?

598
00:50:06,074 --> 00:50:07,205
I don't know, I-

599
00:50:07,292 --> 00:50:08,816
What do you mean
you don't know?

600
00:50:08,903 --> 00:50:10,469
Where the hell
is my daughter?!

601
00:50:10,557 --> 00:50:12,210
Momma.

602
00:50:17,912 --> 00:50:19,261
Oh, my baby.

603
00:50:28,792 --> 00:50:29,924
What's the word?

604
00:50:30,011 --> 00:50:31,099
No activity in the unit
since patrol showed up,

605
00:50:31,186 --> 00:50:33,144
and none of the neighbors
witnessed him leaving.

606
00:50:33,275 --> 00:50:34,668
Could be holed up,
waiting for us.

607
00:50:34,798 --> 00:50:36,191
Could be.

608
00:50:36,278 --> 00:50:38,062
Let's go see.

609
00:50:43,807 --> 00:50:46,288
Police!

610
00:50:46,375 --> 00:50:47,768
Can I have the keys?

611
00:50:56,298 --> 00:50:57,342
Clear!

612
00:51:05,655 --> 00:51:07,004
Clear!

613
00:51:13,315 --> 00:51:14,533
Clear!

614
00:51:16,231 --> 00:51:17,972
Clear! Clear!

615
00:51:19,321 --> 00:51:20,931
All clear.

616
00:51:21,062 --> 00:51:22,106
This is the
right spot.

617
00:51:27,024 --> 00:51:28,112
She was spot on.

618
00:51:38,122 --> 00:51:39,820
Jennings.I'll get the
BOLO out.

619
00:51:39,950 --> 00:51:40,908
And get Kara
to make that ID.

620
00:51:41,038 --> 00:51:42,344
Yes, sir.

621
00:51:42,431 --> 00:51:44,302
Do a sweep
of the area.

622
00:51:44,433 --> 00:51:46,783
Surrounding buildings, parking
lots, any suspicious man.

623
00:51:46,914 --> 00:51:49,264
Get the technicians here.

624
00:51:49,394 --> 00:51:51,048
You'll have those additional
search warrants ASAP.

625
00:51:51,179 --> 00:51:52,006
Yes, sir.

626
00:51:57,359 --> 00:52:00,362
Can't believe they
have kept us waiting.

627
00:52:00,492 --> 00:52:02,843
I'm going to get
you something.

628
00:52:06,063 --> 00:52:07,499
I'm fine.

629
00:52:07,630 --> 00:52:10,372
No, I'm going to say something
and I'm going to get them to-

630
00:52:10,502 --> 00:52:14,158
No, please just
stop, please.

631
00:52:14,245 --> 00:52:16,030
Are you hungry?

632
00:52:16,117 --> 00:52:17,248
Are you, are
you thirsty?

633
00:52:17,379 --> 00:52:18,075
Are you...

634
00:52:18,206 --> 00:52:19,686
Miss Johnson.

635
00:52:19,816 --> 00:52:21,035
Hi there.
We haven't met yet.

636
00:52:21,122 --> 00:52:22,819
I am Sergeant Jennings.

637
00:52:22,950 --> 00:52:26,083
I'd like to give you some
pictures to look at and

638
00:52:26,170 --> 00:52:28,129
see if your
kidnapper's in there.

639
00:52:28,216 --> 00:52:29,870
If you're up for it.Yeah, of course.

640
00:52:39,749 --> 00:52:40,707
Number four.

641
00:52:40,794 --> 00:52:42,186
You're sure?Number four.

642
00:52:48,062 --> 00:52:51,065
That's the man that is leasing
the apartment that you were in.

643
00:52:51,195 --> 00:52:52,980
Um, his name is
Richard Marc Evonitz.

644
00:52:53,067 --> 00:52:55,547
Unfortunately, he was gone
by the time we got there.

645
00:52:55,634 --> 00:52:57,332
Are you saying he's
still out there? Mom.

646
00:52:57,462 --> 00:52:59,116
We've got everyone out
there looking for him.

647
00:52:59,203 --> 00:53:00,552
He's not
gonna get far.

648
00:53:00,683 --> 00:53:05,079
Oh, well, everyone's looking
out for him, that's reassuring.

649
00:53:05,166 --> 00:53:07,037
Kara, if there is anything
that you think you might know,

650
00:53:07,168 --> 00:53:09,126
or any information that you have
that might help us figure out

651
00:53:09,213 --> 00:53:10,998
where Evonitz is going.

652
00:53:11,128 --> 00:53:13,957
Yeah, he was honorably
discharged from the navy

653
00:53:14,044 --> 00:53:15,698
at least a couple
of years ago.

654
00:53:15,785 --> 00:53:18,396
And the gray
parakeet that he has,

655
00:53:18,483 --> 00:53:22,009
actually I think it's a
cockatiel, um, his name's Clyde,

656
00:53:22,139 --> 00:53:24,576
and he's had it longer
than any of his other pets.

657
00:53:24,707 --> 00:53:27,928
Uh, the woman that he lives with
is probably in Disney World

658
00:53:28,058 --> 00:53:30,278
right now with somebody else,
so he's got to go back to work

659
00:53:30,365 --> 00:53:34,021
tomorrow, something to do
with, like, air compressors.

660
00:53:34,108 --> 00:53:37,024
Family doctors
name is Dr. Reitz,

661
00:53:37,154 --> 00:53:42,812
and the phone number for
that is 803-555-6714,

662
00:53:42,943 --> 00:53:45,162
and he's a got a
history of anxiety,

663
00:53:45,249 --> 00:53:48,122
and he's got a dentist as well
whose name is Dr. Greg Nublin

664
00:53:48,252 --> 00:53:57,392
and the number for that is
803-555-8562, 803-555-856, yeah.

665
00:53:57,522 --> 00:54:00,221
There's a box, a big box, too,
underneath all of his animal

666
00:54:00,351 --> 00:54:02,223
cages that he did not
want me to know about,

667
00:54:02,353 --> 00:54:04,660
so you should probably
find whatever that is,

668
00:54:04,747 --> 00:54:05,792
you should find that.

669
00:54:05,922 --> 00:54:08,446
We will.
Be sure to do that.

670
00:54:08,533 --> 00:54:11,188
In fact, would you mind
calling that all in right now?

671
00:54:11,319 --> 00:54:14,061
Thank you.

672
00:54:14,191 --> 00:54:17,238
While the detective is
updating Lieutenant Rowland,

673
00:54:17,368 --> 00:54:19,588
I'd like to talk through
some of what comes next.

674
00:54:19,675 --> 00:54:21,068
Okay.

675
00:54:21,198 --> 00:54:22,896
Two specially trained
nurses are gonna come in,

676
00:54:22,983 --> 00:54:24,811
they're gonna
collect your clothes,

677
00:54:24,898 --> 00:54:27,291
and any other relevant
evidence, you know.

678
00:54:27,378 --> 00:54:29,554
First thing we have to do is
we have to ask you some more

679
00:54:29,685 --> 00:54:31,382
detailed questions about
what happened.

680
00:54:31,513 --> 00:54:32,122
Okay.Okay?

681
00:54:36,605 --> 00:54:39,608
Mom, could you go outside
for this part, do you think?

682
00:54:39,738 --> 00:54:42,480
Uh, of course, baby.

683
00:54:42,567 --> 00:54:45,919
I'll just be in the hallway
if you need anything.

684
00:54:54,275 --> 00:54:56,277
Okay, Kara, you ready?

685
00:54:56,364 --> 00:54:57,844
Yeah.

686
00:55:02,109 --> 00:55:04,894
Sir, what's in here
just keeps getting worse.

687
00:55:04,981 --> 00:55:06,113
And no sign of Evonitz.

688
00:55:06,200 --> 00:55:08,071
No, sir.

689
00:55:08,158 --> 00:55:10,900
Did find a vehicle registered
in his name, a Taurus,

690
00:55:10,987 --> 00:55:12,728
not the Trans Am.

691
00:55:12,815 --> 00:55:15,557
BOLO's been updated with
Kara's ID, but no hits yet.

692
00:55:17,385 --> 00:55:19,082
Let's damn well hope whatever
he's hiding in his foot locker

693
00:55:19,169 --> 00:55:20,562
is something useful.

694
00:55:21,998 --> 00:55:23,260
We have bolt
cutters in here.

695
00:55:33,357 --> 00:55:34,793
Gonna need some
evidence bags.

696
00:55:37,144 --> 00:55:40,060
That's the outfit that
Kara described him wearing.

697
00:55:44,238 --> 00:55:45,674
Those aren't?

698
00:55:45,804 --> 00:55:48,807
No, no, they're
not Kara's.

699
00:56:13,571 --> 00:56:16,879
Officer, you get me everything
you can find on these cases,

700
00:56:17,010 --> 00:56:19,186
and the number to the
Spotsylvania County Sheriff.

701
00:56:22,232 --> 00:56:23,842
Those notes
decipherable?

702
00:56:23,973 --> 00:56:27,629
Some, these, these
might be directions.

703
00:56:27,716 --> 00:56:30,023
Figure it out,
Lieutenant.

704
00:56:30,110 --> 00:56:32,939
Use whatever you need, and
find this son of a bitch.

705
00:56:36,551 --> 00:56:38,509
Have you ever been to
a gynecologist, honey?

706
00:56:38,596 --> 00:56:40,163
No.

707
00:56:40,250 --> 00:56:41,948
Okay, the next thing that
we need to do here is

708
00:56:42,078 --> 00:56:44,341
a pelvic exam,
all right?

709
00:56:44,472 --> 00:56:46,169
Okay, all right.

710
00:56:46,300 --> 00:56:48,128
If you could just
scooch forward,

711
00:56:48,258 --> 00:56:51,218
lie down and raise
your knees.

712
00:57:00,923 --> 00:57:03,665
Okay, here we go.

713
00:57:03,752 --> 00:57:05,145
Get through this.

714
00:57:07,016 --> 00:57:08,626
Get justice.

715
00:57:18,941 --> 00:57:21,248
Please take this,
he's dangerous.

716
00:57:25,426 --> 00:57:28,255
Seen this man?No, no.

717
00:57:29,473 --> 00:57:32,650
No. But, okay, I'm
gonna put this up back.

718
00:57:34,043 --> 00:57:35,044
Okay, perfect.

719
00:57:39,396 --> 00:57:41,311
Have you had any
updates from your people?

720
00:57:41,398 --> 00:57:43,313
Nobody's seen head
or tail of this guy.

721
00:57:43,444 --> 00:57:45,750
I heard you want
with the Feds.

722
00:57:45,881 --> 00:57:47,361
They got a lead?

723
00:57:47,448 --> 00:57:50,190
No. What we do have is more
information from the FBI

724
00:57:50,277 --> 00:57:53,845
and the Silva/Lisk Task Force
on the Spotsylvania cases.

725
00:57:53,932 --> 00:57:56,935
Sophia Sylva, age 16,
was snatched off her

726
00:57:57,066 --> 00:57:58,850
own front porch.

727
00:57:58,981 --> 00:58:01,418
The police worked
it as a runaway.

728
00:58:01,549 --> 00:58:03,942
The body wasn't found
'til months later.

729
00:58:04,030 --> 00:58:06,249
We put the wrong guy away for it
in an uproar to bring justice

730
00:58:06,336 --> 00:58:10,514
to the girl, and not even a
year later two other girls,

731
00:58:10,645 --> 00:58:13,691
12 and 15-year-old sisters are
grabbed from their front yard.

732
00:58:13,778 --> 00:58:17,043
This man holds these
children for days,

733
00:58:17,130 --> 00:58:19,697
then he drowns them in his
bathtub and dumps their bodies

734
00:58:19,784 --> 00:58:21,482
in the swamp.

735
00:58:21,569 --> 00:58:25,268
That Task Force has been working
those cases for five years.

736
00:58:25,355 --> 00:58:27,662
I'm not gonna say it's Evonitz
before the evidence is in.

737
00:58:27,792 --> 00:58:29,185
Hell, I'll say it.

738
00:58:29,316 --> 00:58:32,884
Evonitz is a serial
killer of little girls.

739
00:58:33,015 --> 00:58:35,496
The papers in the foot locker
were mostly full of stalking

740
00:58:35,583 --> 00:58:38,760
notes, potential victims
from the looks of it.

741
00:58:38,847 --> 00:58:40,675
But we've been able to track
down all the most recent

742
00:58:40,805 --> 00:58:43,112
targets, they're okay.

743
00:58:43,243 --> 00:58:44,679
Was the Robinson
girl in those notes?

744
00:58:44,809 --> 00:58:47,203
Kara, no she wasn't.

745
00:58:47,334 --> 00:58:49,118
The girl we think it was meant
to be went to a friend's

746
00:58:49,205 --> 00:58:51,294
instead of walking home.

747
00:58:51,425 --> 00:58:54,080
That makes you think about what
other cases could be out there.

748
00:58:54,210 --> 00:58:57,344
You put some of
my guys on that.

749
00:58:57,431 --> 00:59:01,217
I mean there's no way Evonitz
started with those murders.

750
00:59:01,348 --> 00:59:04,264
Sheriff, Sheriff, we've
gotten hold of the woman

751
00:59:04,394 --> 00:59:05,656
with the long
blond hair.

752
00:59:05,743 --> 00:59:08,268
Evonitz's wife, Ashley.

753
00:59:08,355 --> 00:59:11,184
She and Evonitz's mother
are exactly where Kara said,

754
00:59:11,314 --> 00:59:12,881
Disney World.

755
00:59:12,968 --> 00:59:14,187
They're headed
back to cooperate.

756
00:59:14,317 --> 00:59:15,927
Well that's good news.

757
00:59:16,014 --> 00:59:18,887
We've also got the mother's
okay to search her house.

758
00:59:19,017 --> 00:59:21,716
And one of the sisters is
coming in tomorrow to answer

759
00:59:21,846 --> 00:59:23,326
some questions, too.

760
00:59:23,413 --> 00:59:26,199
I only pray that she's got
something worth telling.

761
00:59:28,984 --> 00:59:30,290
You and me both.

762
00:59:36,034 --> 00:59:37,253
Kara.Kara.

763
00:59:39,821 --> 00:59:40,778
Hey.

764
00:59:44,608 --> 00:59:48,308
Hey, that's okay, it's not your
fault, Jess, it's not your.

765
00:59:58,056 --> 00:59:59,797
Oh, sweetheart.

766
00:59:59,884 --> 01:00:00,972
I want to go home.

767
01:00:08,023 --> 01:00:09,285
Are you okay?

768
01:00:14,986 --> 01:00:16,988
Can you tell me
what happened?

769
01:00:17,075 --> 01:00:18,947
Where were you?

770
01:00:19,077 --> 01:00:20,209
Do you know where
you were?

771
01:00:20,340 --> 01:00:22,777
Can you stop asking
questions, please stop.

772
01:00:22,864 --> 01:00:26,128
Kara, honey, I, I
just, you can tell me,

773
01:00:26,259 --> 01:00:27,869
you can tell
me anything.

774
01:00:27,956 --> 01:00:29,175
I want you
to tell me.

775
01:00:33,962 --> 01:00:40,098
You don't want to know,
so just...just don't ask

776
01:00:40,186 --> 01:00:41,752
if you don't want to
know the answer.

777
01:00:56,027 --> 01:00:57,551
Any sign of him?Not a one.

778
01:00:57,681 --> 01:00:59,030
Seems like he just came by
to drop his momma's car off

779
01:00:59,117 --> 01:01:00,858
and take her other one.

780
01:01:00,945 --> 01:01:03,165
I've updated the BOLO, but
he's switched cars once,

781
01:01:03,296 --> 01:01:04,340
I'm sure he's
done it again.

782
01:01:04,471 --> 01:01:05,907
No, you're
likely right.

783
01:01:05,994 --> 01:01:07,169
FBI's on its way out to take
control of the evidence

784
01:01:07,300 --> 01:01:09,302
collection themselves.

785
01:01:09,389 --> 01:01:11,608
I wouldn't be surprised if they
just end up shipping the thing

786
01:01:11,695 --> 01:01:13,088
straight to Quantico.

787
01:01:13,175 --> 01:01:14,307
That thing's gonna have
some evidence of those

788
01:01:14,394 --> 01:01:16,439
Virginia girls,
I'd put money on it.

789
01:01:16,570 --> 01:01:18,746
Maybe we'll find some
stash of his in the house.

790
01:01:18,876 --> 01:01:20,487
Maybe.

791
01:01:20,617 --> 01:01:22,140
It's hard to take comfort
in closing cold cases when

792
01:01:22,271 --> 01:01:23,925
he's still out there
to make new ones.

793
01:01:25,927 --> 01:01:28,059
Listen, I'll stay here
and wait for the Feds.

794
01:01:28,146 --> 01:01:30,845
I want you to go and
check in with Kara.

795
01:01:30,975 --> 01:01:32,194
She should know where
we're at with the search.

796
01:01:32,281 --> 01:01:34,065
Okay.

797
01:01:48,297 --> 01:01:50,038
Oh, hey.

798
01:01:50,125 --> 01:01:51,605
Hello.

799
01:01:51,692 --> 01:01:53,128
Come on in.

800
01:01:54,434 --> 01:01:56,566
Hey, thank you so
much for coming over.

801
01:01:56,697 --> 01:01:58,438
This means a lot.

802
01:01:58,568 --> 01:01:59,830
My mom's just,
like, in the kitchen

803
01:01:59,917 --> 01:02:01,223
if you're
looking for her.

804
01:02:01,310 --> 01:02:02,616
Okay.

805
01:02:05,401 --> 01:02:07,098
Hey, Kara, you're a tough
girl to get an audience with.

806
01:02:07,229 --> 01:02:08,926
I can't do
this anymore.

807
01:02:09,013 --> 01:02:11,277
Okay, come on.

808
01:02:17,195 --> 01:02:18,632
How can I help?

809
01:02:18,762 --> 01:02:20,329
Why are the
police still here?

810
01:02:20,416 --> 01:02:21,896
Like, what's
going on?

811
01:02:22,026 --> 01:02:23,419
Some of the officers are
here for your protection

812
01:02:23,550 --> 01:02:25,421
because we don't know
where Evonitz is yet.

813
01:02:25,508 --> 01:02:28,250
We just need to take
that extra precaution.

814
01:02:28,381 --> 01:02:30,818
There are a lot of officers
across both counties,

815
01:02:30,905 --> 01:02:32,950
and now the FBI involved.

816
01:02:33,037 --> 01:02:35,823
So, sometimes they
might be showing up here

817
01:02:35,953 --> 01:02:38,129
for information,
or updates.

818
01:02:38,216 --> 01:02:41,872
But the final reason
is understanding.

819
01:02:41,959 --> 01:02:44,353
You know, they all know you
escaped something on your own,

820
01:02:44,440 --> 01:02:50,316
so they're impressed, or
curious, or just concerned.

821
01:02:50,446 --> 01:02:53,884
It's the same reason why you see
people here who you've never

822
01:02:53,971 --> 01:02:56,670
seen in this house before today
just showing up with apologies

823
01:02:56,757 --> 01:02:59,020
and pecan bars.

824
01:02:59,107 --> 01:03:01,152
But I don't want that, I
don't want any of this.

825
01:03:01,283 --> 01:03:03,198
I can certainly
understand that.

826
01:03:03,285 --> 01:03:05,243
That is not
fair to you.

827
01:03:05,331 --> 01:03:07,724
You have every
right to be angry.

828
01:03:07,855 --> 01:03:10,074
But it just comes
down to people caring.

829
01:03:15,253 --> 01:03:18,474
Thank you, Sergeant.

830
01:03:18,605 --> 01:03:22,217
I think I'm just gonna go
lie down for a little bit.

831
01:03:22,304 --> 01:03:23,523
That's not a bad idea.

832
01:03:23,653 --> 01:03:24,872
Okay.

833
01:03:26,221 --> 01:03:27,744
And then maybe you'll
catch him tomorrow and

834
01:03:27,875 --> 01:03:29,311
everything will
go back to normal.

835
01:03:29,398 --> 01:03:31,357
Maybe.

836
01:03:31,444 --> 01:03:33,924
Might take a little while
longer than tomorrow, Kara.

837
01:03:34,055 --> 01:03:36,013
But sleep is always
a good start.

838
01:04:06,130 --> 01:04:08,176
I think I'm gonna go over
to Ryan's after breakfast.

839
01:04:08,263 --> 01:04:11,048
You're not
going anywhere.

840
01:04:11,135 --> 01:04:13,834
They still haven't caught
that horrible man, and,

841
01:04:13,964 --> 01:04:16,227
and they're here to keep watch
'cause he could be out there

842
01:04:16,358 --> 01:04:18,491
looking for you,
anybody could.

843
01:04:18,578 --> 01:04:20,318
I was allowed to go to Ryan's
whenever I wanted without

844
01:04:20,406 --> 01:04:21,972
asking you, like,
two days ago.

845
01:04:22,059 --> 01:04:23,234
That was two
days ago.

846
01:04:23,321 --> 01:04:24,540
What's
different now?

847
01:04:24,627 --> 01:04:26,368
Kara.No for real, what's
different now?

848
01:04:26,499 --> 01:04:29,066
I don't need
protecting.

849
01:04:29,197 --> 01:04:31,199
I got back here all by myself,
I'm not gonna stop acting

850
01:04:31,329 --> 01:04:33,375
the way that I used to act
because of all of this.

851
01:04:33,506 --> 01:04:38,728
This isn't my life.

852
01:04:38,815 --> 01:04:40,991
It's just something
that happened.

853
01:04:43,080 --> 01:04:44,342
No, we're not done
discussing this.

854
01:04:44,430 --> 01:04:45,953
You are not
leaving this house.

855
01:04:47,781 --> 01:04:49,173
Is it, is it
okay that I came?

856
01:04:49,304 --> 01:04:50,610
Yeah, I'm so glad
you're here right now.

857
01:04:51,872 --> 01:04:52,829
Let's go to my room.

858
01:05:00,184 --> 01:05:01,229
Do you want to do our
nails or something?

859
01:05:01,359 --> 01:05:02,970
I can get my
nail polish.

860
01:05:04,275 --> 01:05:07,583
Uh, yeah, whatever
you want to do.

861
01:05:11,848 --> 01:05:14,198
Just ask.

862
01:05:14,329 --> 01:05:16,331
Ask what?

863
01:05:16,462 --> 01:05:18,159
Just ask what you
really want to ask.

864
01:05:20,248 --> 01:05:22,990
No.

865
01:05:23,120 --> 01:05:25,601
No, I just
wanted to see you.

866
01:05:25,732 --> 01:05:28,169
To see if
you were okay.

867
01:05:28,256 --> 01:05:32,216
As, as okay
as you can be.

868
01:05:32,347 --> 01:05:34,131
I'm okay.

869
01:05:34,218 --> 01:05:36,046
Really, I'm okay.

870
01:05:36,177 --> 01:05:38,222
Just ask.

871
01:05:43,837 --> 01:05:45,229
What happened?

872
01:05:51,148 --> 01:05:52,367
A man pulled
into the driveway.

873
01:05:55,544 --> 01:05:58,112
He sent me to Disney
because he's a good man.

874
01:05:58,199 --> 01:06:00,418
Marc couldn't have
done all that.

875
01:06:00,506 --> 01:06:04,771
I'm sorry to say he did, Ashley,
and if we can't track him down,

876
01:06:04,858 --> 01:06:07,425
he might do
something else.

877
01:06:07,556 --> 01:06:10,124
So, do you have any idea
where your husband might be?

878
01:06:10,211 --> 01:06:11,908
No.

879
01:06:12,039 --> 01:06:15,085
He says he's happiest
when he's with me.

880
01:06:15,172 --> 01:06:18,175
If he's not
at his mom's.

881
01:06:18,262 --> 01:06:20,482
He hasn't tried to call
you or contact you at all?

882
01:06:20,569 --> 01:06:22,571
No.

883
01:06:22,658 --> 01:06:27,794
But he loves me no matter what,
and I love him no matter what.

884
01:06:27,881 --> 01:06:29,883
Okay.

885
01:06:35,889 --> 01:06:37,238
Hi Mama.

886
01:06:37,325 --> 01:06:39,806
Hi Ashley.Stephanie?

887
01:06:39,893 --> 01:06:41,982
Hi.

888
01:06:42,069 --> 01:06:45,855
I'm sure they just called her
in like they did us, honey.

889
01:06:45,942 --> 01:06:49,380
From what I know
he's in Ashley's car,

890
01:06:49,467 --> 01:06:53,297
but he told me he
switched the plates.

891
01:06:53,428 --> 01:06:56,910
They were still South
Carolina, I think.

892
01:07:00,522 --> 01:07:06,006
He's probably gonna find a way
to contact one of us soon.

893
01:07:06,136 --> 01:07:08,225
He's trying to find a
way to get Ashley to him.

894
01:07:20,194 --> 01:07:26,026
I have a feeling that this
is not the first time Marc

895
01:07:26,156 --> 01:07:28,594
has done something like
this with a young girl.

896
01:07:32,206 --> 01:07:34,861
Finding out the brother you care
about isn't who you thought is a

897
01:07:34,948 --> 01:07:39,692
tough thing, Stephanie, but you
have done good talking to me.

898
01:07:47,482 --> 01:07:50,616
Marc contacted me
yesterday afternoon.

899
01:07:54,837 --> 01:07:55,969
I'm sorry.

900
01:07:57,579 --> 01:08:00,451
Sheriff, Evonitz is at this
motel outside of Orangeburg.

901
01:08:00,582 --> 01:08:03,063
The room is under his sister's
name, Stephanie Newell.

902
01:08:03,150 --> 01:08:04,325
She hasn't talked
to him since.

903
01:08:04,455 --> 01:08:05,587
He should
still be there.

904
01:08:05,718 --> 01:08:06,980
Not check out yet.

905
01:08:07,110 --> 01:08:08,242
Jennings, get
down there.

906
01:08:08,372 --> 01:08:09,896
I'll get Orangeburg Sheriff
to send a team ASAP.

907
01:08:09,983 --> 01:08:11,027
Copy.

908
01:08:22,082 --> 01:08:24,258
Oh, just
ignore them.

909
01:08:31,482 --> 01:08:32,701
So you're still gonna
come and pick me up

910
01:08:32,787 --> 01:08:34,747
later for the
game, right?

911
01:08:34,877 --> 01:08:36,878
Um, yeah.

912
01:08:37,010 --> 01:08:39,839
Okay.Of course,
same as always.

913
01:08:53,766 --> 01:08:55,680
Well hello there.

914
01:08:55,811 --> 01:08:57,987
I'm here to talk
to your mom.

915
01:08:58,073 --> 01:09:00,773
Sheriff Stevens,
Lexington County.Right on, yeah,
she's inside.

916
01:09:00,903 --> 01:09:03,689
Hmm, how are
you doing?

917
01:09:05,125 --> 01:09:07,040
Good, I'm fine.

918
01:09:08,606 --> 01:09:10,086
You've been through a hell
of an ordeal, young lady.

919
01:09:10,172 --> 01:09:12,915
You've been victimized.

920
01:09:13,046 --> 01:09:16,005
You ought to take
some time to recover.

921
01:09:16,091 --> 01:09:17,659
You really shouldn't be out
and about when we haven't

922
01:09:17,790 --> 01:09:19,748
caught your attacker yet.

923
01:09:19,878 --> 01:09:21,532
Maybe you should get
out there and catch him.

924
01:09:21,618 --> 01:09:23,883
You certainly didn't help
me the first time around.

925
01:09:29,802 --> 01:09:32,674
You know that guy was
gonna kill you, right?

926
01:09:32,805 --> 01:09:37,026
And all things said, you
should be dead right now.

927
01:09:37,113 --> 01:09:40,681
He's likely killed
at least three girls.

928
01:09:40,813 --> 01:09:43,554
Now the evidence hasn't
come in yet, but it will.

929
01:09:43,641 --> 01:09:47,733
You should thank your lucky
stars that you weren't next.

930
01:09:47,863 --> 01:09:50,735
Luck had nothing
to do with it.

931
01:09:58,656 --> 01:09:59,570
Well, Evonitz
wasn't at the motel,

932
01:09:59,657 --> 01:10:00,920
but it looks like
he left in a hurry.

933
01:10:01,007 --> 01:10:02,051
The shirt Kara was wearing
when he took her is here,

934
01:10:02,138 --> 01:10:04,184
and some of his
clothes, too.

935
01:10:04,271 --> 01:10:06,839
Orangeburg's agreed to keep
surveillance on the room in case

936
01:10:06,969 --> 01:10:09,493
he comes back, but I think
he's probably on the move.

937
01:10:09,624 --> 01:10:11,757
Okay, make sure that
evidence gets where it ought

938
01:10:11,844 --> 01:10:13,323
and come on back.

939
01:10:13,454 --> 01:10:14,585
One of the family
tipped him off.

940
01:10:14,671 --> 01:10:16,892
Probably, but at least we
know for sure he's running,

941
01:10:16,979 --> 01:10:19,765
not stalking Kara or
some other girl, running.

942
01:10:19,852 --> 01:10:21,070
Yeah, at least for now.

943
01:10:21,157 --> 01:10:22,506
At least for now.

944
01:10:22,593 --> 01:10:24,465
The FBI sent the prelims on
the fibres from the handcuffs,

945
01:10:24,552 --> 01:10:26,380
it's looking like a match
to the fibres found on

946
01:10:26,510 --> 01:10:28,948
all three bodies, and
there's a full palm print

947
01:10:29,078 --> 01:10:30,427
on the inside
of the trunk.

948
01:10:30,514 --> 01:10:31,907
Between that and his
sister's statement.

949
01:10:31,993 --> 01:10:33,387
I know.

950
01:10:33,517 --> 01:10:36,085
An entirely off the radar
serial killer done in by his

951
01:10:36,216 --> 01:10:38,871
intended victim,
it's incredible.

952
01:10:46,313 --> 01:10:48,837
Hello Kara.

953
01:10:48,968 --> 01:10:52,100
Jim Price, Sheriff
for Richland Country.

954
01:10:52,188 --> 01:10:53,885
Are you gonna tell me
to stay inside, too,

955
01:10:54,016 --> 01:10:56,192
because you haven't done
your job yet and my attacker

956
01:10:56,278 --> 01:10:58,238
is a serial killer?

957
01:10:58,368 --> 01:11:01,153
I'd never presume to tell
you what to do, Kara.

958
01:11:01,284 --> 01:11:05,984
Even if I thought Evonitz was
a threat to you, and I don't.

959
01:11:18,519 --> 01:11:20,826
I won't ask who told
you about our suspicions

960
01:11:20,912 --> 01:11:23,480
since it
doesn't matter.

961
01:11:23,611 --> 01:11:27,876
What does matter is what you
know and what you want to know.

962
01:11:27,963 --> 01:11:30,357
Did he kill
those three girls?

963
01:11:30,487 --> 01:11:33,186
We can't say
for certain yet.

964
01:11:33,273 --> 01:11:36,015
What we know was in the foot
locker you pointed out,

965
01:11:36,144 --> 01:11:38,974
were articles discussing the
disappearance and murder of

966
01:11:39,105 --> 01:11:42,064
three girls around your age
from about five years ago.

967
01:11:42,151 --> 01:11:43,849
Why would he have those
if he didn't kill them?

968
01:11:43,979 --> 01:11:46,460
That's a good question, but
someone was wrongly accused for

969
01:11:46,590 --> 01:11:50,203
the first girl's murder,
which is why I make it a point

970
01:11:50,290 --> 01:11:52,858
to wait on
the evidence.

971
01:11:52,988 --> 01:11:56,165
Would he have
killed me?

972
01:11:56,252 --> 01:11:59,212
I can't say that.

973
01:11:59,341 --> 01:12:03,564
But even if he wanted to, you
didn't give him the chance.

974
01:12:07,437 --> 01:12:11,093
So, the reason I
came looking for you.

975
01:12:11,224 --> 01:12:14,880
I needed to come and say
thank you for the incredible

976
01:12:14,966 --> 01:12:17,839
thing you've done.

977
01:12:17,970 --> 01:12:21,016
Some people will try to
tell you you're a victim,

978
01:12:21,147 --> 01:12:24,977
but you really
are is a survivor,

979
01:12:25,064 --> 01:12:30,373
one with a kind of strength and
grace that's rare in this world.

980
01:12:30,504 --> 01:12:35,335
We may not have your captor yet,
but we're going to get him.

981
01:12:35,465 --> 01:12:39,207
And when we do, it will
be because of you, Kara.

982
01:12:39,295 --> 01:12:41,907
Thank you.

983
01:12:42,037 --> 01:12:45,649
You're welcome,
I guess.

984
01:12:50,437 --> 01:12:52,874
You let me know if there's
anything I can do for you.

985
01:12:53,005 --> 01:12:54,528
And if you
wouldn't mind,

986
01:12:54,658 --> 01:12:57,009
I'd love to come by and
see you sometime again.

987
01:12:57,096 --> 01:12:59,837
See you around
then, Sheriff.

988
01:13:07,323 --> 01:13:08,803
Sheriff Price.

989
01:13:08,890 --> 01:13:10,283
Evonitz used his cell
phone about 15 minutes ago

990
01:13:10,412 --> 01:13:12,415
just outside of
Jacksonville, Florida.

991
01:13:12,546 --> 01:13:14,983
Now, we're guessing he's headed
to see his other sister.

992
01:13:15,070 --> 01:13:16,767
She's about three hours
further south in Bradenton.

993
01:13:16,854 --> 01:13:18,291
Okay, this is it.

994
01:13:18,377 --> 01:13:19,596
You make sure the police in
Jacksonville and Bradenton

995
01:13:19,683 --> 01:13:20,814
are up to date.

996
01:13:20,902 --> 01:13:22,207
I'll call
State myself.

997
01:13:22,338 --> 01:13:24,210
And make sure you get
the family to tell you

998
01:13:24,340 --> 01:13:27,039
everything they know, or
drag them into the station.

999
01:13:27,169 --> 01:13:29,215
Yes, sir.

1000
01:13:29,302 --> 01:13:31,130
Neither Ashley nor Maggie seem
to know anything about Florida,

1001
01:13:31,260 --> 01:13:33,219
or anymore than
they did before,

1002
01:13:33,305 --> 01:13:34,785
though I do think
they talk to him.

1003
01:13:34,916 --> 01:13:37,266
Stephanie was the same, but
Pamela's still or best bet.

1004
01:13:37,397 --> 01:13:38,876
Well, let's see then.

1005
01:13:45,840 --> 01:13:47,189
Hello.

1006
01:13:47,276 --> 01:13:50,018
Miss Evonitz, this is
Lieutenant Rowland from...

1007
01:13:50,149 --> 01:13:51,933
From Richland Sheriff's
office, right.

1008
01:13:52,064 --> 01:13:54,153
I see your family's been
keeping you up to date.

1009
01:13:54,240 --> 01:13:56,024
Yeah.

1010
01:13:56,155 --> 01:13:57,765
Would that include
your brother, ma'am?

1011
01:13:57,852 --> 01:13:59,201
He called maybe
two hours ago.

1012
01:13:59,332 --> 01:14:01,247
He wants me to
meet him tonight,

1013
01:14:01,334 --> 01:14:03,249
outside his favorite restaurant.

1014
01:14:03,379 --> 01:14:04,902
In Bradenton?

1015
01:14:05,033 --> 01:14:07,122
Yeah, the Pancake
Griddle off US 41.

1016
01:14:07,252 --> 01:14:08,993
What time, ma'am?

1017
01:14:11,909 --> 01:14:13,041
This is Sergeant
Jennings with Richland.

1018
01:14:13,127 --> 01:14:15,174
Yeah, we just called.

1019
01:14:15,304 --> 01:14:16,740
Our guy is headed
straight to you.

1020
01:14:19,178 --> 01:14:21,135
Kara, you can't
just go out into a,

1021
01:14:21,267 --> 01:14:23,269
a crowd full of strangers,
just you and Jess and...

1022
01:14:23,356 --> 01:14:25,010
Mom, this is what
we always do,

1023
01:14:25,140 --> 01:14:27,229
we go to the boy's
baseball game together.

1024
01:14:27,359 --> 01:14:29,623
We have a really good
time, that is it.

1025
01:14:29,752 --> 01:14:31,189
You can't know that.

1026
01:14:33,061 --> 01:14:35,455
Look, it's, Kara,
it's just been a day.

1027
01:14:35,542 --> 01:14:37,239
You need to
take some time.

1028
01:14:37,326 --> 01:14:38,849
I don't need
time, Mom.

1029
01:14:38,936 --> 01:14:40,025
I don't need time, I just
need everything to be normal.

1030
01:14:40,112 --> 01:14:42,723
Kara it is not.

1031
01:14:42,810 --> 01:14:43,984
He is still out there.

1032
01:14:44,072 --> 01:14:46,073
He is not here!

1033
01:14:46,161 --> 01:14:48,642
He's not here, I am!

1034
01:14:48,729 --> 01:14:50,818
I am right here.

1035
01:14:50,948 --> 01:14:52,776
I need to go back and do the
things that I usually do.

1036
01:14:52,907 --> 01:14:54,778
I need everything
to be normal, okay.

1037
01:14:54,909 --> 01:14:57,955
I am not gonna let him take
this away from me, too!

1038
01:15:02,786 --> 01:15:05,050
I need to do this.

1039
01:15:05,137 --> 01:15:07,008
I'm gonna do this.

1040
01:15:07,139 --> 01:15:08,792
I'm so sorry,
I'm gonna do this.

1041
01:15:16,148 --> 01:15:18,237
Hey.Hey.

1042
01:15:26,027 --> 01:15:29,073
Officers be advised,
FBI units are now in position.

1043
01:15:31,206 --> 01:15:32,729
What's the chance
he's gonna show?

1044
01:15:32,816 --> 01:15:34,862
I guess we'll find
out in a minute.

1045
01:15:34,992 --> 01:15:36,993
Unit 1-1-3.

1046
01:15:37,125 --> 01:15:39,040
This is 1-1-3.

1047
01:15:39,171 --> 01:15:41,521
We got two sightings
of the suspect's vehicle.

1048
01:15:41,651 --> 01:15:45,090
Most recent turning
onto 16th, headed south.

1049
01:15:45,177 --> 01:15:47,091
He's coming your way.

1050
01:15:54,186 --> 01:15:57,058
I'll punch anybody who
looks at you funny.

1051
01:15:57,189 --> 01:15:59,843
It's gonna be okay.It's fine.

1052
01:15:59,974 --> 01:16:02,063
You just go get
good spots, okay,

1053
01:16:02,194 --> 01:16:04,631
and I'm gonna go wish Ryan
good luck, like always.

1054
01:16:08,809 --> 01:16:11,290
Kara, you came?

1055
01:16:11,420 --> 01:16:14,336
Like I would
miss a game.

1056
01:16:14,466 --> 01:16:16,599
That's why you're
the best girlfriend.

1057
01:16:20,341 --> 01:16:21,865
Hey.

1058
01:16:23,737 --> 01:16:26,696
You know you
don't have to stay.

1059
01:16:29,350 --> 01:16:30,961
Good luck.

1060
01:16:33,180 --> 01:16:34,835
Dispatch, no sign
of the vehicle.

1061
01:16:37,707 --> 01:16:38,707
Wait.

1062
01:16:42,016 --> 01:16:42,930
Dispatch, we have
eyes on the suspect.

1063
01:16:43,060 --> 01:16:44,627
Go and apprehend, over.

1064
01:16:44,758 --> 01:16:45,889
Copy that.

1065
01:16:49,066 --> 01:16:50,850
Suspect is running
northbound on 16th.

1066
01:16:50,938 --> 01:16:52,331
Unit 1-1-3 in pursuit.

1067
01:16:56,073 --> 01:16:57,901
Now moving west on 52nd.

1068
01:16:58,032 --> 01:16:59,338
He just ran straight
into traffic.

1069
01:17:01,470 --> 01:17:03,646
Suspect's fled
to alley behind 56.

1070
01:17:03,777 --> 01:17:05,126
We still got him.

1071
01:17:05,257 --> 01:17:06,562
Still in pursuit.

1072
01:17:08,956 --> 01:17:11,828
Units 2-1-6 and 3-4
arriving from the west.

1073
01:17:11,915 --> 01:17:14,179
Be advised 1-1-3, over.

1074
01:17:19,096 --> 01:17:21,447
On deck, number nine.

1075
01:17:21,534 --> 01:17:24,754
I was there, you know, like at
the hospital when she came out.

1076
01:17:24,885 --> 01:17:27,714
She wouldn't let any man
touch her, not even her dad.

1077
01:17:29,759 --> 01:17:31,239
I cannot believe.

1078
01:17:31,326 --> 01:17:35,548
Hey, do you know me?

1079
01:17:39,116 --> 01:17:40,769
I didn't think so.

1080
01:17:46,646 --> 01:17:47,864
Woo!

1081
01:17:55,524 --> 01:17:57,700
Unit 1-1-3, do
you have a visual? Over.

1082
01:18:02,009 --> 01:18:03,706
Unit 1-1-3, where you at?

1083
01:18:06,143 --> 01:18:07,319
Unit 1-1-3.

1084
01:18:09,321 --> 01:18:10,800
Dispatch, we
have the suspect.

1085
01:18:10,930 --> 01:18:12,062
Suspect is armed.
Requesting backup.

1086
01:18:14,108 --> 01:18:16,153
All units,
repeat, all units,

1087
01:18:16,241 --> 01:18:19,243
requesting canine to respond
to standoff with armed suspect.

1088
01:18:20,027 --> 01:18:21,637
Put down your weapon!

1089
01:18:21,724 --> 01:18:23,073
Drop it!
It's over!

1090
01:18:23,160 --> 01:18:24,727
Drop your weapon!

1091
01:18:26,599 --> 01:18:27,903
Woo!

1092
01:18:34,868 --> 01:18:36,086
Drop your weapon!

1093
01:18:36,173 --> 01:18:38,653
I said drop
your weapon!Okay, okay.

1094
01:18:38,741 --> 01:18:40,134
Put down
your weapon!

1095
01:18:41,743 --> 01:18:42,745
Drop it!
It's over!

1096
01:18:55,192 --> 01:18:57,238
Suspect is down.

1097
01:18:57,325 --> 01:18:59,327
We have a 10-56.

1098
01:18:59,414 --> 01:19:00,937
Appears deceased.

1099
01:19:18,738 --> 01:19:21,567
Kara, sweetheart,
rise and shine.

1100
01:19:59,256 --> 01:20:01,215
Hey, honey.Hey.

1101
01:20:01,346 --> 01:20:03,739
Good morning.

1102
01:20:03,870 --> 01:20:05,132
What's going on?

1103
01:20:05,262 --> 01:20:07,526
I made us some
breakfast.

1104
01:20:07,656 --> 01:20:13,183
So, why don't
you take a seat.

1105
01:20:13,314 --> 01:20:15,795
Wow, you never
make breakfast,

1106
01:20:15,882 --> 01:20:20,103
and I'd much rather know
what's going on first.

1107
01:20:20,234 --> 01:20:23,498
Okay.

1108
01:20:23,585 --> 01:20:26,849
Well, Sergeant Jennings will
be here to explain more,

1109
01:20:26,936 --> 01:20:28,460
and if you have
any questions,

1110
01:20:28,546 --> 01:20:34,335
but last night that
man killed himself.

1111
01:20:34,421 --> 01:20:37,077
So it's truly
over now, honey.

1112
01:20:37,164 --> 01:20:38,600
You're safe.

1113
01:20:41,995 --> 01:20:44,693
Why didn't anyone
tell me that?I'm telling you
now, sweetheart.

1114
01:20:44,823 --> 01:20:46,478
It happened
last night?

1115
01:20:46,564 --> 01:20:49,176
Why didn't anyone tell me that
last night when it happened?

1116
01:20:49,263 --> 01:20:51,961
There was no
reason to.

1117
01:20:52,048 --> 01:20:55,704
I should have know-, what
is it that you're trying

1118
01:20:55,791 --> 01:20:57,402
to protect me from?

1119
01:20:57,489 --> 01:20:59,752
You were having a nice time
at the game like you wanted,

1120
01:20:59,839 --> 01:21:01,231
so we didn't want to...

1121
01:21:14,897 --> 01:21:16,551
Hey there, Kara.

1122
01:21:16,682 --> 01:21:21,251
If you think that I'm
not mad at you, I-No, I know.

1123
01:21:21,338 --> 01:21:24,037
You're absolutely
right to be mad.

1124
01:21:24,124 --> 01:21:27,606
If anyone deserved to know
what was happening it was you.

1125
01:21:27,693 --> 01:21:30,086
We should have told
you right away.

1126
01:21:30,216 --> 01:21:32,785
I should have
known better.

1127
01:21:32,915 --> 01:21:35,309
I'm sorry I
broke that trust.

1128
01:21:41,314 --> 01:21:47,189
You know, I'm not much trained
in this sort of thing.

1129
01:21:47,277 --> 01:21:49,541
But if I had to
put money on it,

1130
01:21:49,627 --> 01:21:52,631
I'd say you weren't just
mad about the delay.

1131
01:22:02,031 --> 01:22:03,816
I'm mad at him.

1132
01:22:09,082 --> 01:22:10,866
I'm just so
mad at him.

1133
01:22:14,957 --> 01:22:16,742
And all I've been
thinking about,

1134
01:22:16,829 --> 01:22:18,265
the only thing that's been
getting me through the

1135
01:22:18,352 --> 01:22:22,356
interviews and the exams and the
people and everyone staring,

1136
01:22:22,487 --> 01:22:28,796
all I wanted was
just to get justice,

1137
01:22:28,928 --> 01:22:31,191
and I wanted him to go to
jail for a hundred years,

1138
01:22:31,321 --> 01:22:33,715
and I wanted him
to rot there.

1139
01:22:33,802 --> 01:22:36,109
But only after I got to
stare him down in court,

1140
01:22:36,196 --> 01:22:39,329
and made him face me, and I got
to tell him about everything

1141
01:22:39,416 --> 01:22:44,334
that I remembered, and I'd let
him know that picking me was

1142
01:22:44,465 --> 01:22:46,989
the biggest mistake that
he's ever made in his life.

1143
01:22:47,076 --> 01:22:50,252
I don't know, I'm
just mad at him.

1144
01:22:50,340 --> 01:22:53,082
I shouldn't have
yelled at my mom.

1145
01:22:56,868 --> 01:22:58,871
That was messed up.

1146
01:23:08,489 --> 01:23:10,273
So now that
there's no trial,

1147
01:23:10,359 --> 01:23:11,884
I don't have to tell
my story in court.

1148
01:23:12,014 --> 01:23:15,365
That's right.

1149
01:23:15,496 --> 01:23:18,804
And my mom and my dad and
Ryan aren't gonna have to know

1150
01:23:18,891 --> 01:23:24,243
what actually, like, like
what actually happened.

1151
01:23:31,207 --> 01:23:32,818
And they're not
gonna be hurt.

1152
01:23:42,828 --> 01:23:44,656
Well, it's for
the best then.

1153
01:23:49,965 --> 01:23:52,751
You're a hero, Kara.

1154
01:23:52,838 --> 01:23:56,232
I know it may not
always feel that way.

1155
01:23:56,363 --> 01:23:59,888
But the way you
saved yourself,

1156
01:23:59,975 --> 01:24:02,848
the way you, even now, are
taking care of the people

1157
01:24:02,978 --> 01:24:08,287
you love, you're a hero.

1158
01:24:08,418 --> 01:24:11,117
I'd hire you for the
force in a heartbeat.

1159
01:24:15,338 --> 01:24:19,691
And as for Evonitz, there is
no doubt he knew you were

1160
01:24:19,778 --> 01:24:22,607
his greatest mistake.

1161
01:24:22,737 --> 01:24:25,827
And I couldn't be more
proud of you for it.

1162
01:24:34,227 --> 01:24:35,620
Just give her
some time.

1163
01:24:35,707 --> 01:24:36,969
She's processing a lot.

1164
01:24:40,581 --> 01:24:42,148
Can you give us a second,
Sergeant Jennings?

1165
01:24:42,234 --> 01:24:44,063
Of course.

1166
01:24:48,153 --> 01:24:51,113
I don't really feel like
a hug right now, Mom.

1167
01:24:51,200 --> 01:24:52,637
Okay.

1168
01:24:56,423 --> 01:24:58,903
It's not because
of, like...

1169
01:25:05,867 --> 01:25:07,695
...I just feel like I
really want to do what

1170
01:25:07,782 --> 01:25:09,741
I feel like doing.

1171
01:25:09,828 --> 01:25:15,050
Of course,
and I'm sorry.

1172
01:25:15,180 --> 01:25:18,140
I'm trying.

1173
01:25:18,271 --> 01:25:20,707
I don't know
what to do.

1174
01:25:20,795 --> 01:25:22,448
I just really want
to be here for you.

1175
01:25:22,536 --> 01:25:25,757
I know you do, and I'm
gonna try to let you know

1176
01:25:25,887 --> 01:25:28,542
when you can be, okay.

1177
01:25:32,981 --> 01:25:35,591
But you can't change
what happened.

1178
01:25:41,642 --> 01:25:43,035
It happened.

1179
01:25:47,343 --> 01:25:50,607
But I'm still here.

1180
01:25:50,738 --> 01:25:52,260
I'm still me.

1181
01:26:01,053 --> 01:26:02,924
I survived.

1182
01:26:20,202 --> 01:26:21,943
I survived.
