1
00:03:06,521 --> 00:03:08,056
<i>911.</i>
<i>What's your emergency?</i>

2
00:03:08,122 --> 00:03:09,456
<i>We've been attacked.</i>

3
00:03:09,524 --> 00:03:11,092
<i>There are people</i>
<i>trying to kill us.</i>

4
00:03:11,159 --> 00:03:12,459
<i>Where are you located?</i>

5
00:03:12,527 --> 00:03:13,995
<i>Do you have an address?</i>

6
00:03:14,062 --> 00:03:17,832
<i>Airbnb, Venus. Please.</i>

7
00:03:35,449 --> 00:03:39,219
So I'm thinking rustic, very,
with Tudor-style steeples

8
00:03:39,286 --> 00:03:41,421
and a stone chimney
right in the middle.

9
00:03:41,488 --> 00:03:43,725
Yeah, totally.
Like a witch's house.

10
00:03:43,791 --> 00:03:45,560
Where are you going to put
your broomstick collection?

11
00:03:45,626 --> 00:03:47,427
How about the cage that
you're gonna be sleeping in,

12
00:03:47,494 --> 00:03:48,896
'cause you won't
be sleeping with me.

13
00:03:50,198 --> 00:03:52,332
-Oh.
-What?

14
00:03:52,399 --> 00:03:54,468
Three hundred more miles
to Portland.

15
00:03:54,535 --> 00:03:56,269
I'm gonna need to eat
before then.

16
00:03:58,238 --> 00:03:59,874
-Make it so.
-All right.

17
00:04:06,714 --> 00:04:08,149
I'll bet the people
who live here

18
00:04:08,216 --> 00:04:09,449
are really happy.

19
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:14,655
Hey, do you know
what today is?

20
00:04:15,322 --> 00:04:16,591
Today is the third day

21
00:04:16,657 --> 00:04:18,226
of our three-day road trip
across the country.

22
00:04:18,291 --> 00:04:19,894
Or our five-year anniversary.

23
00:04:19,961 --> 00:04:21,996
Anniversary? I just picked
you up in Chicago.

24
00:04:22,063 --> 00:04:23,497
Best 16 hours of your life.

25
00:04:23,564 --> 00:04:24,799
I love you.

26
00:04:25,533 --> 00:04:27,267
Shit! Shit!

27
00:04:32,140 --> 00:04:33,741
Fuck off!

28
00:04:35,342 --> 00:04:37,044
-Are you okay?
-I'm fine, I'm fine.

29
00:04:46,687 --> 00:04:50,390
Hey. Hey, calm down.
It's over.

30
00:04:50,457 --> 00:04:52,226
Do you want your inhaler?

31
00:04:52,292 --> 00:04:54,427
-Yeah, thanks. Thanks, babe.
-Here.

32
00:05:09,510 --> 00:05:11,746
Ally shows our funds
came through.

33
00:05:11,813 --> 00:05:13,614
Where even
are we right now?

34
00:05:14,081 --> 00:05:16,117
Oh, shit, no signal.

35
00:05:16,184 --> 00:05:17,218
-Okay.
-Keep driving,

36
00:05:17,285 --> 00:05:18,519
maybe it'll pick up.

37
00:05:19,687 --> 00:05:22,089
We are actually
in the middle of nowhere.

38
00:05:22,156 --> 00:05:23,791
Now I know what it looks like.

39
00:05:23,858 --> 00:05:26,359
We might just die
of starvation.

40
00:05:26,426 --> 00:05:27,762
She was on her way

41
00:05:27,829 --> 00:05:29,396
to interview for a top
Portland architectural firm

42
00:05:29,462 --> 00:05:31,799
when her GPS failed.

43
00:05:31,866 --> 00:05:33,466
She is however survived

44
00:05:33,534 --> 00:05:34,769
-by her boyfriend, Ryan...
-What? No.

45
00:05:34,836 --> 00:05:36,871
Yes. Sorry, babe,
I had to eat your remains.

46
00:05:38,873 --> 00:05:40,975
Ah! Civilization.

47
00:05:41,042 --> 00:05:45,345
Venus, Oregon.
Population: 468.

48
00:05:57,692 --> 00:06:00,094
-What a cool little town.
-Yeah, I'm starving.

49
00:06:01,696 --> 00:06:03,731
I could eat
a whole fucking cow.

50
00:06:27,321 --> 00:06:28,823
Sit anywhere.

51
00:06:28,890 --> 00:06:29,924
Thanks.

52
00:06:51,312 --> 00:06:53,581
-What?
-Just Debbie and Howard.

53
00:06:56,350 --> 00:06:57,551
So cute.

54
00:06:57,618 --> 00:06:58,953
Are you having FOMO
about missing Howard's

55
00:06:59,020 --> 00:07:01,822
kiss-my-ass
birthday extravaganza?

56
00:07:02,690 --> 00:07:05,192
Well, it is a kiss-my-ass

57
00:07:05,259 --> 00:07:07,762
birthday extravaganza
in Greece,

58
00:07:07,828 --> 00:07:08,930
so yes.

59
00:07:08,996 --> 00:07:11,132
Why be in Greece
when you can be in Venus?

60
00:07:12,333 --> 00:07:14,001
Hi, y'all. My name's Shelly.

61
00:07:14,602 --> 00:07:15,803
Soup is beef chili.

62
00:07:15,870 --> 00:07:17,271
Pies are huckleberry
and apple.

63
00:07:17,338 --> 00:07:18,673
Can I get you
something to drink?

64
00:07:18,739 --> 00:07:20,975
Can we start off
with two iced teas?

65
00:07:21,042 --> 00:07:23,377
And do you have any
vegetarian recommendations?

66
00:07:23,443 --> 00:07:24,679
Annie?

67
00:07:25,212 --> 00:07:26,380
Got a vegetarian here.

68
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:29,150
I like the Carol's Salad,
hold the bacon.

69
00:07:29,984 --> 00:07:31,185
Um, that sounds great.

70
00:07:31,252 --> 00:07:33,955
Yeah, actually, can we get
the bacon and extra cheese

71
00:07:34,021 --> 00:07:35,423
and put that
on a turkey melt for me?

72
00:07:35,488 --> 00:07:36,958
-You got it.
-Great. Thanks.

73
00:07:38,326 --> 00:07:39,894
Could you eat
any less healthy?

74
00:07:39,961 --> 00:07:41,195
It's my anniversary.

75
00:07:42,363 --> 00:07:43,931
Oh my God,
it's their anniversary.

76
00:07:44,398 --> 00:07:45,933
Ours too, almost.

77
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,101
Two years.

78
00:07:47,168 --> 00:07:48,769
Eden. Neil.

79
00:07:48,836 --> 00:07:49,637
Hey.

80
00:07:49,704 --> 00:07:52,606
I'm Maya and this is Ryan.

81
00:07:52,673 --> 00:07:53,975
And how long
you guys been married?

82
00:07:54,041 --> 00:07:56,544
We're not. We're not married.

83
00:07:56,610 --> 00:07:58,679
We've just been dating
for five years.

84
00:08:00,648 --> 00:08:01,983
Five years

85
00:08:02,049 --> 00:08:04,685
and you ain't put a ring
on her finger?

86
00:08:04,752 --> 00:08:06,486
What the hell
are you waiting for?

87
00:08:07,855 --> 00:08:10,024
Well, right now, I'm just
waiting on my turkey melt.

88
00:08:14,996 --> 00:08:15,997
Tough crowd, right?

89
00:08:22,670 --> 00:08:24,171
Anything else?

90
00:08:24,238 --> 00:08:25,272
Got it.

91
00:08:25,339 --> 00:08:26,907
Yeah, um,

92
00:08:26,974 --> 00:08:29,076
we could use some directions
to the highway.

93
00:08:32,079 --> 00:08:33,114
On the back.

94
00:08:37,118 --> 00:08:39,153
He was some
big corporate finance guy.

95
00:08:39,220 --> 00:08:40,654
Passed through.

96
00:08:40,721 --> 00:08:43,591
Ate here, actually,
and then totally disappeared.

97
00:08:44,458 --> 00:08:46,060
Hope he didn't
have the turkey melt.

98
00:08:46,127 --> 00:08:47,862
He did.

99
00:08:51,165 --> 00:08:52,233
Okay.

100
00:09:05,646 --> 00:09:07,048
What's going on?

101
00:09:08,282 --> 00:09:09,518
Car won't start.

102
00:09:09,583 --> 00:09:10,951
Take the key out of your
pocket and try it again.

103
00:09:11,018 --> 00:09:12,019
Good call.

104
00:09:13,888 --> 00:09:15,356
All right.

105
00:09:19,894 --> 00:09:21,796
Shit.

106
00:09:28,002 --> 00:09:29,570
Car trouble?

107
00:09:32,873 --> 00:09:34,108
Yeah.

108
00:09:34,175 --> 00:09:35,276
I'm Rudy.

109
00:09:35,342 --> 00:09:36,677
That's my garage.

110
00:09:41,749 --> 00:09:43,651
Yeah, your alternator's shot.

111
00:09:43,717 --> 00:09:45,186
You need a new one.

112
00:09:45,252 --> 00:09:46,353
How long will that take?

113
00:09:47,354 --> 00:09:48,355
We gotta pick up the part

114
00:09:48,422 --> 00:09:49,957
from the dealer
over in Eugene.

115
00:09:50,024 --> 00:09:52,426
Is that something you could
maybe do tonight?

116
00:09:52,493 --> 00:09:53,727
Tonight?

117
00:09:54,428 --> 00:09:55,930
They're already closed.

118
00:09:55,996 --> 00:09:58,299
I can send Dougie
first thing in the morning.

119
00:09:58,999 --> 00:10:00,768
Install it in the afternoon.

120
00:10:00,835 --> 00:10:02,603
So we'd have to spend
the night?

121
00:10:03,604 --> 00:10:06,006
Is there anywhere
to stay close by?

122
00:10:06,073 --> 00:10:08,142
Well, motel's closed
for repairs,

123
00:10:08,209 --> 00:10:12,246
but there's one of them
Internet houses.

124
00:10:12,313 --> 00:10:14,615
He means an Airbnb.
There's an older guy,

125
00:10:14,682 --> 00:10:16,383
Joe Gressis.
He rents it out sometimes.

126
00:10:16,450 --> 00:10:18,652
Except during hunting season.

127
00:10:18,719 --> 00:10:19,887
Yeah, Joe likes to hunt.

128
00:10:19,954 --> 00:10:21,655
He's there
from August to December.

129
00:10:21,722 --> 00:10:22,957
But he keeps it pretty nice.

130
00:10:23,357 --> 00:10:25,126
-Okay.
-No, no.

131
00:10:25,192 --> 00:10:27,094
This is a scam.
I saw you watching us.

132
00:10:27,161 --> 00:10:29,630
Will you excuse us
for one second, please?

133
00:10:30,464 --> 00:10:31,499
Ryan, what's wrong with you?

134
00:10:31,566 --> 00:10:32,666
These people
aren't scamming us.

135
00:10:32,733 --> 00:10:34,168
You just think
this is a coincidence?

136
00:10:34,235 --> 00:10:36,103
The mechanic watched us
going into the diner

137
00:10:36,170 --> 00:10:37,606
and then suddenly
he's fixing our car

138
00:10:37,671 --> 00:10:38,873
that wasn't even broken.

139
00:10:38,939 --> 00:10:40,207
We literally almost
got into a car wreck,

140
00:10:40,274 --> 00:10:41,275
like, an hour ago.

141
00:10:41,342 --> 00:10:42,810
Something might have
gotten messed up, okay?

142
00:10:42,877 --> 00:10:44,478
Please stop being paranoid.

143
00:10:44,546 --> 00:10:45,547
Please stop being naive.

144
00:10:45,614 --> 00:10:46,714
You know what, Rudy?

145
00:10:46,780 --> 00:10:47,781
That sounds great.

146
00:10:47,848 --> 00:10:49,650
We appreciate it. Thanks.

147
00:10:49,717 --> 00:10:51,620
Dougie'll tow your car
to the garage,

148
00:10:51,719 --> 00:10:53,154
then I guess
he can drive you two.

149
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:55,489
I'm off in, like, 10 minutes.
I can drive you.

150
00:10:55,557 --> 00:10:57,124
I live out that way.

151
00:10:57,191 --> 00:10:58,659
That's so kind of you.

152
00:10:58,726 --> 00:11:00,562
Thank you.

153
00:11:00,629 --> 00:11:02,963
Yeah. Good tippers,
good karma, right?

154
00:11:04,865 --> 00:11:06,100
What?

155
00:11:10,704 --> 00:11:12,139
-Hi.
-Hi.

156
00:11:14,308 --> 00:11:15,709
The Lord will set you free.

157
00:11:17,344 --> 00:11:18,879
Are you sinners?

158
00:11:20,014 --> 00:11:21,882
Aren't we all?

159
00:11:58,786 --> 00:12:00,689
It looks cute.

160
00:12:00,754 --> 00:12:02,990
-Think it has electricity?
-Probably not.

161
00:12:05,793 --> 00:12:07,494
We really appreciate it,
Shelly.

162
00:12:08,862 --> 00:12:10,464
Thank you.

163
00:12:10,532 --> 00:12:11,865
-Bye.
-Bye.

164
00:12:15,803 --> 00:12:17,672
-Take care.
-Bye.

165
00:12:41,161 --> 00:12:44,031
I actually like this so much
better than a hotel.

166
00:12:45,232 --> 00:12:46,433
What do you think,

167
00:12:47,401 --> 00:12:49,036
you negative Nancy?

168
00:12:49,903 --> 00:12:51,272
Let's check it out.

169
00:13:00,781 --> 00:13:03,217
Hey. Wanna have a little fun?

170
00:13:11,292 --> 00:13:12,326
Shit.

171
00:13:14,895 --> 00:13:16,130
Fridge is out.

172
00:13:17,331 --> 00:13:18,866
Wow!
Would you look at that?

173
00:13:18,932 --> 00:13:21,802
-What?
-A number to call
if there's any problems.

174
00:13:22,537 --> 00:13:24,038
Get 'em while they're cold.

175
00:13:26,641 --> 00:13:28,309
This is Maya Lucas.

176
00:13:28,375 --> 00:13:33,013
I am renting your beautiful
property, and...

177
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:34,516
you know, thank you
for the short notice.

178
00:13:34,582 --> 00:13:36,785
I'm actually calling because

179
00:13:36,850 --> 00:13:38,586
your refrigerator is broken,

180
00:13:38,653 --> 00:13:42,022
and hoping that you could
maybe send someone to fix it.

181
00:13:42,089 --> 00:13:43,257
We'll be here all night

182
00:13:43,324 --> 00:13:45,125
and this is a great number
to reach me at.

183
00:13:45,593 --> 00:13:46,894
Thank you.

184
00:14:02,009 --> 00:14:03,243
Do you hear that?

185
00:14:03,944 --> 00:14:05,312
Hear what?

186
00:14:06,413 --> 00:14:08,415
The silence.

187
00:14:08,482 --> 00:14:13,722
No car horns,
no 5:00 a.m. garbage truck,

188
00:14:13,788 --> 00:14:16,423
no crazy person
yelling at 2:00 a.m.

189
00:14:16,490 --> 00:14:19,860
Yeah, that's 'cause
there's nothing
within five miles of this place.

190
00:14:22,597 --> 00:14:25,199
But it's nice, right?

191
00:14:28,302 --> 00:14:29,370
Yeah.

192
00:14:30,371 --> 00:14:31,506
It is.

193
00:14:35,710 --> 00:14:38,011
So, isn't this the best

194
00:14:38,078 --> 00:14:39,781
five-year anniversary
you've had?

195
00:14:39,848 --> 00:14:43,350
You know, I would say
it is one of the best.

196
00:14:49,824 --> 00:14:51,191
What are you thinking?

197
00:14:51,258 --> 00:14:54,228
I'm thinking about how
that greasy motherfucker Rudy

198
00:14:54,294 --> 00:14:56,330
better have my car
in by tomorrow.

199
00:14:56,397 --> 00:15:00,000
Wow, I am so turned on
right now.

200
00:15:01,368 --> 00:15:02,403
-Oh, yeah?
-Mm.

201
00:15:02,469 --> 00:15:03,638
Prove it.

202
00:15:13,147 --> 00:15:14,682
To be clear,
I may be kissing you,

203
00:15:14,749 --> 00:15:16,483
but I'm thinking of Rudy.

204
00:15:16,551 --> 00:15:17,985
Oh, fuck off.

205
00:16:30,658 --> 00:16:32,560
Is Tamara here?

206
00:16:35,597 --> 00:16:36,831
No.

207
00:16:36,898 --> 00:16:38,633
I think you have
the wrong home.

208
00:17:01,556 --> 00:17:02,724
That was weird.

209
00:17:04,893 --> 00:17:06,493
Where'd she even come from?

210
00:17:08,930 --> 00:17:10,632
We're out in the middle
of nowhere.

211
00:17:36,456 --> 00:17:38,526
I think I know
the state motto now.

212
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:41,796
"It's better in Oregon."

213
00:17:43,196 --> 00:17:44,532
Well, it is now.

214
00:17:49,469 --> 00:17:51,104
This house kinda
reminds me of that place

215
00:17:51,171 --> 00:17:52,574
we stayed near Woodstock.

216
00:17:54,141 --> 00:17:55,977
Rondout Valley?

217
00:17:56,044 --> 00:17:58,178
That was more glamping
than it was camping.

218
00:18:00,815 --> 00:18:02,215
You know, I...

219
00:18:06,654 --> 00:18:07,722
I thought...

220
00:18:08,488 --> 00:18:09,624
What?

221
00:18:12,192 --> 00:18:15,029
Do you remember that hike
we went on up to the Vista

222
00:18:15,095 --> 00:18:16,731
and that gorgeous sunset?

223
00:18:22,870 --> 00:18:24,872
It just felt like
the perfect...

224
00:18:26,507 --> 00:18:29,944
Maya, I thought you didn't
want to get married.

225
00:18:30,011 --> 00:18:32,580
Ryan, I said that,
like, five years ago.

226
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:35,583
Yeah, you never unsaid it.

227
00:18:39,419 --> 00:18:41,388
If I get the job in Portland,

228
00:18:42,790 --> 00:18:44,291
you'll move with me, right?

229
00:18:45,526 --> 00:18:46,561
Yeah.

230
00:18:47,729 --> 00:18:48,863
Yeah, of course.

231
00:18:50,397 --> 00:18:52,299
I know how much
the city means to you

232
00:18:52,366 --> 00:18:54,134
and what you're giving up.

233
00:18:56,104 --> 00:18:57,872
I know you're doing it for me.

234
00:19:02,543 --> 00:19:03,611
So...

235
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:07,147
do you?

236
00:19:10,018 --> 00:19:12,854
I know I want to spend
the rest of my life with you.

237
00:19:17,959 --> 00:19:19,192
You know what?

238
00:19:19,961 --> 00:19:21,062
I'll surprise you.

239
00:19:21,129 --> 00:19:23,263
Well, maybe
not a full surprise

240
00:19:23,330 --> 00:19:24,565
because I do have
some ideas...

241
00:19:24,632 --> 00:19:25,667
No.

242
00:19:32,073 --> 00:19:33,708
Where's my stupid inhaler?

243
00:19:38,046 --> 00:19:39,379
Shit.

244
00:19:39,814 --> 00:19:40,882
What?

245
00:19:40,948 --> 00:19:42,349
Ryan, I don't think
I put it back in your bag.

246
00:19:42,416 --> 00:19:44,284
I think it's in the car.

247
00:19:44,351 --> 00:19:46,353
Damn it. No, no, it's okay.

248
00:19:46,420 --> 00:19:48,455
It's not your fault.
I should've checked.

249
00:19:51,358 --> 00:19:52,459
You know what,

250
00:19:52,527 --> 00:19:53,995
there's an old motorcycle
out front.

251
00:19:54,062 --> 00:19:56,731
I can just drive it into town
and take it out of the car.

252
00:19:56,798 --> 00:19:58,866
Have you ever ridden
a motorcycle before?

253
00:19:59,801 --> 00:20:01,502
Yeah, a few times.

254
00:20:02,036 --> 00:20:03,905
-Also...
-What?

255
00:20:03,971 --> 00:20:05,205
I'm hungry.

256
00:20:06,641 --> 00:20:07,709
I'm on it.

257
00:20:21,789 --> 00:20:24,291
I see Howard
is truly enjoying Greece

258
00:20:24,357 --> 00:20:25,760
and everything
it has to offer.

259
00:20:25,827 --> 00:20:28,663
<i>What bumblefuck town</i>
<i>are you guys in now?</i>

260
00:20:29,163 --> 00:20:31,431
Uh, Venus, Oregon.

261
00:20:31,498 --> 00:20:33,067
It's a cute,
quaint little spot.

262
00:20:33,134 --> 00:20:34,401
<i>Okay. Well,</i>
<i>you give me the nod,</i>

263
00:20:34,468 --> 00:20:36,204
<i>I'll get Howard</i>
<i>to get a private plane,</i>

264
00:20:36,269 --> 00:20:37,572
<i>get you two guys over here.</i>

265
00:20:37,638 --> 00:20:39,507
We're fine. Really,
we're having a good time.

266
00:20:39,574 --> 00:20:41,408
<i>Is that a nod? You want me</i>
<i>to pull the trigger?</i>

267
00:20:41,475 --> 00:20:43,310
<i>Howard. Howard.</i>

268
00:20:44,612 --> 00:20:45,947
Oh, my God,
you already looked into it,

269
00:20:46,013 --> 00:20:47,014
didn't you?

270
00:20:49,050 --> 00:20:50,350
Debbie, I gotta go.

271
00:20:50,417 --> 00:20:51,819
I love you. Behave.

272
00:20:55,022 --> 00:20:56,456
Ryan?

273
00:21:04,766 --> 00:21:07,467
Ry, I knew you couldn't
ride a motorcycle.

274
00:21:15,576 --> 00:21:16,778
Ryan?

275
00:21:32,026 --> 00:21:33,094
Ryan?

276
00:21:37,330 --> 00:21:38,566
Hello?

277
00:21:52,547 --> 00:21:55,382
Is Tamara here?

278
00:21:55,448 --> 00:21:59,486
No, we already told you
there is no Tamara here.

279
00:22:23,744 --> 00:22:24,946
Hello?

280
00:22:56,577 --> 00:22:58,779
Is Tamara here?

281
00:23:25,506 --> 00:23:27,508
Ryan, please get back here.

282
00:24:11,185 --> 00:24:12,720
Stupid.

283
00:25:08,309 --> 00:25:09,710
Oh, my God.

284
00:25:44,879 --> 00:25:46,147
<i>Hey, this is Ryan.</i>

285
00:25:46,213 --> 00:25:47,848
<i>Leave me a message.</i>

286
00:25:47,915 --> 00:25:50,751
That girl came back,
and then she left again.

287
00:25:51,619 --> 00:25:52,787
I don't know. It...

288
00:25:52,853 --> 00:25:55,122
It was really weird.
Can you...

289
00:25:57,091 --> 00:25:59,060
get here soon, please?

290
00:27:54,408 --> 00:27:56,277
It's me, Ryan. This is my car.

291
00:27:56,343 --> 00:27:58,779
I just left something inside,
all right?

292
00:27:58,846 --> 00:28:00,781
You should have called first.

293
00:28:01,382 --> 00:28:03,717
Yeah. Yeah, I just didn't...

294
00:28:03,784 --> 00:28:05,119
Could have thought
you were a car thief.

295
00:28:05,186 --> 00:28:06,720
Hey, hey. Hey.

296
00:28:09,223 --> 00:28:10,925
I'm gonna go, okay?

297
00:28:18,232 --> 00:28:19,266
Got it.

298
00:28:22,504 --> 00:28:24,104
You have a good night, Rudy.

299
00:30:31,932 --> 00:30:33,167
...what do you expect?

300
00:30:34,134 --> 00:30:35,670
Hey, it's New York guy.

301
00:30:36,805 --> 00:30:38,105
New York!

302
00:30:38,172 --> 00:30:41,676
How was the turkey melt,
extra bacon, extra cheese?

303
00:30:41,743 --> 00:30:44,011
It was great. Very cheesy.

304
00:30:45,212 --> 00:30:47,481
Wanna join us? We got plenty.

305
00:30:47,549 --> 00:30:49,116
No, thanks. I gotta get back.

306
00:30:49,183 --> 00:30:51,151
Come on, have a beer with us.

307
00:30:51,218 --> 00:30:54,021
Maybe another time.
Have a good night, all right?

308
00:30:54,088 --> 00:30:57,291
Thinks he's too good
for us local shitkickers, huh?

309
00:31:02,329 --> 00:31:03,897
Good evening.

310
00:31:03,964 --> 00:31:06,934
Um, can I please get
a cheeseburger and fries?

311
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,969
And then another cheeseburger,
but no meat.

312
00:31:10,237 --> 00:31:11,972
My girlfriend's a vegetarian.

313
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:14,542
Larry.

314
00:31:15,909 --> 00:31:17,746
Cheers!

315
00:31:17,812 --> 00:31:19,046
Thanks.

316
00:31:23,651 --> 00:31:25,520
Oh. No, thanks.

317
00:31:26,588 --> 00:31:28,088
I got one earlier today.

318
00:32:59,213 --> 00:33:00,447
Great.

319
00:34:58,298 --> 00:35:00,267
Shit.

320
00:36:19,514 --> 00:36:20,882
Maya, what are you doing here?

321
00:36:20,948 --> 00:36:22,416
Why are the lights off?

322
00:36:22,884 --> 00:36:25,318
Hey, what's wrong?

323
00:36:25,385 --> 00:36:27,287
There's somebody in the house.

324
00:36:27,354 --> 00:36:29,757
-And they shut the lights off?
-I don't know.

325
00:36:29,824 --> 00:36:31,224
Okay, okay.

326
00:36:32,093 --> 00:36:33,628
I'm gonna go
find the fuse box.

327
00:36:34,494 --> 00:36:36,463
Ryan, did you see
anybody out there?

328
00:36:37,464 --> 00:36:38,599
No.

329
00:36:39,634 --> 00:36:41,069
Okay. I know
where the fuse box is.

330
00:36:41,135 --> 00:36:42,402
I'll show you.

331
00:36:43,104 --> 00:36:44,172
-Okay.
-Okay.

332
00:36:44,237 --> 00:36:46,339
Hey, come on. Come on.

333
00:36:47,207 --> 00:36:48,543
I got you.

334
00:36:50,078 --> 00:36:51,713
Found it.

335
00:36:57,885 --> 00:36:58,953
All better.

336
00:37:00,621 --> 00:37:01,856
What happened?

337
00:37:03,057 --> 00:37:04,959
Someone was standing
right there.

338
00:37:07,895 --> 00:37:09,664
Are you sure? It was dark.

339
00:37:09,731 --> 00:37:11,231
-Yes.
-Yeah?

340
00:37:11,298 --> 00:37:13,067
They were wearing a mask.

341
00:37:13,134 --> 00:37:14,267
A mask?

342
00:37:14,334 --> 00:37:15,335
What kind of mask?

343
00:37:15,402 --> 00:37:16,571
I don't know, Ryan.

344
00:37:16,637 --> 00:37:19,306
Like a weird,
creepy mask with big eyes,

345
00:37:19,372 --> 00:37:21,542
and he was right there.

346
00:37:29,249 --> 00:37:30,484
I know what happened.

347
00:37:38,226 --> 00:37:39,694
Is that what you saw?

348
00:37:41,863 --> 00:37:44,031
I mean, maybe.

349
00:37:44,098 --> 00:37:45,499
I also heard them.

350
00:37:48,401 --> 00:37:49,704
Were you smoking?

351
00:37:51,739 --> 00:37:53,241
I mean, I smoked
a little bit earlier,

352
00:37:53,306 --> 00:37:54,575
but I don't think that's
anything to do with this.

353
00:37:54,642 --> 00:37:57,044
I told you, that
<i>Freak Brothers</i> shit is strong.

354
00:37:58,079 --> 00:38:00,782
Okay? You're in
an unfamiliar house.

355
00:38:01,481 --> 00:38:03,551
It's pitch black.

356
00:38:03,618 --> 00:38:05,720
I would have thought
I saw something too.

357
00:38:10,290 --> 00:38:11,959
I'm so sick of this shit.

358
00:38:12,026 --> 00:38:13,928
Ry. Ry!

359
00:38:25,338 --> 00:38:26,674
What is it?

360
00:38:27,708 --> 00:38:28,743
That girl.

361
00:38:30,144 --> 00:38:31,646
What's she doing?

362
00:38:31,712 --> 00:38:35,616
Just standing, watching us.

363
00:38:35,683 --> 00:38:37,051
I can't tell.
Is she wearing a mask?

364
00:38:37,118 --> 00:38:38,418
I don't know.

365
00:38:38,485 --> 00:38:40,188
-What are you doing?
-I'm putting an end to this.

366
00:38:40,254 --> 00:38:41,589
Ryan.

367
00:38:41,656 --> 00:38:43,724
-Ryan!
-What's your problem?

368
00:38:45,126 --> 00:38:46,127
I asked you a ques...

369
00:38:46,194 --> 00:38:48,495
Yeah, fuck yeah!
You better run.

370
00:38:48,563 --> 00:38:50,463
Next time,
I'm calling the police.

371
00:39:00,608 --> 00:39:01,642
Hey.

372
00:39:02,844 --> 00:39:04,411
I scared her off. She's not
going to coming back.

373
00:39:04,477 --> 00:39:06,413
What if she does?

374
00:39:06,479 --> 00:39:09,016
She's just some
weird teenage girl, okay?

375
00:39:09,650 --> 00:39:10,952
She's not gonna hurt you.

376
00:39:14,387 --> 00:39:15,556
You're right, you're right.

377
00:39:15,623 --> 00:39:17,390
I have ridden the subway
at 2:00 a.m.

378
00:39:17,457 --> 00:39:19,459
alone with worse, so...

379
00:39:19,527 --> 00:39:21,729
You've lived
to tell about it, right?

380
00:39:22,096 --> 00:39:23,097
Yeah.

381
00:39:23,164 --> 00:39:25,233
Hey, I'm starving.

382
00:39:25,299 --> 00:39:27,034
Wanna get something to eat?

383
00:39:27,101 --> 00:39:29,503
-Okay.
-Come on. Let's go.

384
00:39:48,322 --> 00:39:49,724
I'm thinking, for tomorrow...

385
00:39:51,458 --> 00:39:53,995
if we get the car
back by morning,

386
00:39:54,061 --> 00:39:57,231
then maybe we can be
at Baker City by night.

387
00:39:57,298 --> 00:39:59,867
-Sounds great.
-Right?

388
00:39:59,934 --> 00:40:01,936
Maybe we should factor in
a little bit of time

389
00:40:02,003 --> 00:40:04,538
to clean that food
off of your face.

390
00:40:04,605 --> 00:40:07,208
You got a problem
with all this?

391
00:40:07,275 --> 00:40:08,441
Oh, my God, yeah.

392
00:40:08,509 --> 00:40:10,044
Yeah, I do have
a problem with that.

393
00:40:13,915 --> 00:40:15,583
Why don't you
come solve it, then?

394
00:40:17,218 --> 00:40:18,653
Maybe I will.

395
00:40:23,090 --> 00:40:25,092
Right. I deserved that.

396
00:40:30,564 --> 00:40:32,934
You are the messiest eater
on the planet.

397
00:40:53,154 --> 00:40:56,891
Oh, my God,
oh, my God, oh, my God!

398
00:40:56,958 --> 00:40:58,592
I told you there was someone
in here, Ryan!

399
00:40:58,659 --> 00:41:00,594
Get the door!
Lock the front door!

400
00:41:10,938 --> 00:41:12,506
All right, move!

401
00:42:39,560 --> 00:42:41,729
-Get down. Get down.
-Oh, my God!

402
00:42:42,363 --> 00:42:43,597
Stay there.

403
00:43:29,376 --> 00:43:30,778
Did they leave?

404
00:43:32,113 --> 00:43:33,314
I think so.

405
00:44:14,455 --> 00:44:16,357
They're gone. Look.

406
00:44:25,666 --> 00:44:26,834
Why did it stop?

407
00:44:26,901 --> 00:44:28,435
They're fucking with us.

408
00:44:33,774 --> 00:44:35,676
We have to get out of here.

409
00:44:37,579 --> 00:44:38,879
Oh, shit.

410
00:44:39,581 --> 00:44:40,814
Maya.

411
00:44:41,749 --> 00:44:43,150
The motorcycle.

412
00:44:47,221 --> 00:44:48,722
-Okay.
-Come on.

413
00:45:21,121 --> 00:45:22,156
My phone.

414
00:45:23,724 --> 00:45:25,426
-Look.
-Shit.

415
00:45:26,260 --> 00:45:27,494
Where the fuck is mine?

416
00:45:27,562 --> 00:45:28,796
Let's go.

417
00:45:47,781 --> 00:45:49,016
Come on.

418
00:45:57,626 --> 00:45:59,159
-Shit.
-We need a weapon.

419
00:46:03,864 --> 00:46:05,432
I found one.

420
00:46:05,499 --> 00:46:07,001
Get down, get down.

421
00:46:11,071 --> 00:46:13,073
-He's a hunter, right?
-Yeah.

422
00:46:13,140 --> 00:46:14,441
He owned this cabin. He hunts.

423
00:46:14,509 --> 00:46:16,377
There must be a hunting rifle
in here somewhere.

424
00:46:38,832 --> 00:46:40,301
This house
has a raised foundation.

425
00:46:40,367 --> 00:46:42,504
-A what?
-Crawl space.

426
00:50:09,744 --> 00:50:11,078
I'm so sorry.

427
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:35,302
I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry.

428
00:51:35,797 --> 00:51:37,230
We'll go to the shed.

429
00:51:43,236 --> 00:51:44,739
Okay? All right?

430
00:51:46,541 --> 00:51:47,842
Go, go, go. Go.

431
00:51:51,879 --> 00:51:53,213
Ryan, you okay?

432
00:51:53,280 --> 00:51:54,414
Yeah, yeah,
it's fine, it's fine.

433
00:51:54,481 --> 00:51:56,818
It's just my ankle.
Go, go, go. Okay.

434
00:52:04,491 --> 00:52:06,159
Okay. Okay.

435
00:52:20,875 --> 00:52:22,476
I can't see anything.

436
00:52:23,678 --> 00:52:24,779
Hold on.

437
00:52:28,482 --> 00:52:30,150
Good thing
I smoked that weed.

438
00:52:30,585 --> 00:52:32,053
Here.

439
00:52:32,120 --> 00:52:34,154
-How's your ankle?
-It's fine. I can take it.

440
00:53:00,480 --> 00:53:01,549
No guns.

441
00:53:04,919 --> 00:53:06,353
Hey, hold this for me.

442
00:53:12,927 --> 00:53:14,529
Better than nothing, right?

443
00:53:33,748 --> 00:53:34,782
Fuck.

444
00:53:48,963 --> 00:53:51,532
Fuck. Right, my leg's going.

445
00:53:51,599 --> 00:53:53,467
I'm just going
to sit for a second.

446
00:54:20,661 --> 00:54:21,763
What?

447
00:54:22,362 --> 00:54:24,431
Can you just hold this?

448
00:54:24,498 --> 00:54:26,500
Watch the window,
I'll watch the door.

449
00:54:33,641 --> 00:54:34,742
Careful, Ry.

450
00:54:56,030 --> 00:54:57,098
Anything?

451
00:54:57,165 --> 00:54:58,800
No luck yet,
just a bunch of shit.

452
00:55:02,302 --> 00:55:03,704
Okay.

453
00:55:16,383 --> 00:55:17,585
Ryan, fuck!

454
00:55:17,652 --> 00:55:19,687
Fuck, Ryan!
What the fuck, Ryan!

455
00:55:21,289 --> 00:55:22,623
Fuck!

456
00:55:35,468 --> 00:55:37,104
Come here. Come here.

457
00:55:37,872 --> 00:55:40,508
You're okay.
I've got you, okay?

458
00:55:41,075 --> 00:55:42,409
I got a shotgun.

459
00:55:44,245 --> 00:55:45,613
I got plenty of ammo.

460
00:56:41,636 --> 00:56:43,237
Did you hear that?
What is that?

461
00:56:43,304 --> 00:56:45,573
-One of them's on the porch.
-Fuck.

462
00:56:48,643 --> 00:56:50,578
-Just stay close to me.
-Okay.

463
00:57:13,034 --> 00:57:14,135
Ryan.

464
00:57:16,337 --> 00:57:17,738
Stay here, okay?

465
00:57:18,940 --> 00:57:20,007
I got this.

466
00:57:44,098 --> 00:57:45,232
I got him!

467
00:57:46,734 --> 00:57:48,936
What does that mean,
you got him? Did you kill him?

468
00:57:50,604 --> 00:57:52,406
Yeah. Yeah.

469
00:57:52,472 --> 00:57:55,242
Fuck. Wow, yeah.

470
00:57:55,309 --> 00:57:56,544
Oh, man.

471
00:58:02,083 --> 00:58:04,151
All right. Okay.

472
00:58:04,218 --> 00:58:05,319
-Ryan?
-What?

473
00:58:05,386 --> 00:58:06,754
Hey, where's his mask?

474
00:58:07,588 --> 00:58:08,889
I don't know, babe.
I don't know.

475
00:58:09,489 --> 00:58:10,925
There's no fucking mask.

476
00:58:27,008 --> 00:58:30,177
I think maybe
that's the owner, Joe.

477
00:58:31,979 --> 00:58:33,147
Yeah.

478
00:58:34,849 --> 00:58:36,017
No.

479
00:58:41,022 --> 00:58:43,290
Fuck. No, fuck.

480
00:58:43,357 --> 00:58:45,826
Fuck! Fuck!

481
00:58:51,465 --> 00:58:53,567
Fuck, I just killed him.

482
00:58:55,970 --> 00:58:57,872
You were trying to protect us.

483
00:58:57,938 --> 00:59:01,575
Okay? Hey. Hey, you were
trying to protect us, okay?

484
00:59:13,587 --> 00:59:14,889
Wait.

485
00:59:20,861 --> 00:59:22,696
-Come on. Come on.
-Okay.

486
00:59:23,464 --> 00:59:25,132
-Wait, wait, wait.
-Where you going?

487
00:59:32,940 --> 00:59:34,642
Give me the shotgun.
Give me the shotgun.

488
00:59:42,483 --> 00:59:44,151
Get in. Get in the car.

489
00:59:47,421 --> 00:59:48,656
Oh, my God!

490
00:59:56,430 --> 00:59:58,132
Ryan, go now!

491
01:00:05,706 --> 01:00:07,074
Oh, my God!

492
01:00:11,078 --> 01:00:12,213
Ryan! Oh, God!

493
01:00:13,447 --> 01:00:15,082
Oh, my God!

494
01:00:19,954 --> 01:00:21,655
We're trapped, we're trapped.

495
01:00:22,022 --> 01:00:23,090
It's not moving.

496
01:00:23,157 --> 01:00:24,158
Fuck!

497
01:00:24,225 --> 01:00:25,259
Fuck!

498
01:00:26,227 --> 01:00:28,629
Oh, my God!

499
01:00:28,696 --> 01:00:30,998
Get out. We have to get out.

500
01:00:33,667 --> 01:00:35,636
My leg, it's stuck. I can't.

501
01:00:39,106 --> 01:00:40,808
-Come on, Ryan.
-My leg is stuck.

502
01:00:40,875 --> 01:00:42,243
Give me your arm.

503
01:00:44,513 --> 01:00:46,615
You gotta go. Just go, please.

504
01:00:46,680 --> 01:00:48,983
I am not leaving you.

505
01:00:51,452 --> 01:00:54,655
I love you.
You need to go. Go!

506
01:01:00,562 --> 01:01:01,795
Fuck.

507
01:01:50,311 --> 01:01:51,378
Fuck.

508
01:02:15,336 --> 01:02:16,804
Fuck. Fuck.

Fuck.

Where's Maya?

546
01:12:34,655 --> 01:12:36,123
Drop the fucking knife.

547
01:12:40,094 --> 01:12:41,128
Now!

548
01:12:59,446 --> 01:13:02,482
You're gonna
turn around slowly.

549
01:13:13,127 --> 01:13:14,528
Where's Maya?

550
01:13:23,271 --> 01:13:24,305
Shut the fuck up!

551
01:13:24,372 --> 01:13:25,806
Shut the fuck up!

552
01:13:30,144 --> 01:13:31,746
Gimme one fucking good reason

553
01:13:31,812 --> 01:13:34,015
not to fucking kill you
right now!

554
01:13:36,483 --> 01:13:37,752
Where is she?

555
01:13:42,623 --> 01:13:45,059
You know how they say that
your first kill's the hardest?

556
01:13:50,398 --> 01:13:51,632
You're my second.

557
01:15:02,470 --> 01:15:04,038
Ryan?

558
01:15:07,074 --> 01:15:08,275
Ryan.

559
01:15:10,578 --> 01:15:12,313
Ryan, can you hear me?

560
01:15:21,555 --> 01:15:22,957
-Maya?
-Ryan?

561
01:15:38,272 --> 01:15:39,640
They got us.

562
01:15:45,079 --> 01:15:46,647
It's gonna be okay.

563
01:15:48,517 --> 01:15:49,884
It's gonna be okay.

564
01:15:51,852 --> 01:15:53,054
It will.

565
01:16:06,200 --> 01:16:07,768
I'm so sorry.

566
01:16:07,835 --> 01:16:10,805
-I'm so sorry.
-No, no.

567
01:16:10,871 --> 01:16:13,174
No, it's not your fault.
None of this is your fault.

568
01:16:13,240 --> 01:16:15,276
Okay? None.

569
01:16:31,425 --> 01:16:32,860
Marry me.

570
01:16:33,994 --> 01:16:36,363
-What?
-Will you marry me?

571
01:16:40,468 --> 01:16:43,304
Yes. Yes, of course, yes.

572
01:16:47,675 --> 01:16:50,678
-I love you.
-I love you too.

573
01:18:23,170 --> 01:18:24,471
Ry...

574
01:18:31,680 --> 01:18:32,913
Ry...

575
01:18:43,424 --> 01:18:44,992
What do you want?

576
01:18:47,728 --> 01:18:49,296
Answer me!

577
01:18:51,799 --> 01:18:54,034
Why are you doing this to us?

578
01:19:02,943 --> 01:19:04,745
Because you're here.

579
01:19:53,662 --> 01:19:55,229
Fuck you!
