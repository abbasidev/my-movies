[vibrating stops]

7
00:00:59,208 --> 00:01:02,041
Laura Blacklock. Coming or going?

8
00:01:02,125 --> 00:01:03,291
[Laura] Good question.

9
00:01:03,375 --> 00:01:05,625
Run it by fact-checking
and let me know, would you?

10
00:01:05,708 --> 00:01:08,000
Great piece on the NGOs. Welcome back.

11
00:01:08,083 --> 00:01:09,875
-[woman 1] Hi, Lo. Love the article.
-Thanks.

12
00:01:09,958 --> 00:01:13,458
-[man] Nice piece. Great work.
-[woman 2] Just read it. It's great.

13
00:01:25,458 --> 00:01:26,583
Thanks.

14
00:01:35,125 --> 00:01:36,333

[sighs]

19
00:01:59,625 --> 00:02:01,708
Lo, got a minute before editorial?

20
00:02:01,791 --> 00:02:02,958
Yeah, just a sec.

21
00:02:20,875 --> 00:02:22,000
How was your trip back?

22
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,541
Well, the second of my four-hour flights
on an eight-seater turboprop plane

23
00:02:26,625 --> 00:02:30,291
was only one day delayed,
so, you know, I loved every minute of it.

24
00:02:31,916 --> 00:02:34,958
Do I detect the brittle sarcasm
of the severely jet-lagged

25
00:02:35,041 --> 00:02:37,333
or is the malaise something deeper?

26
00:02:37,416 --> 00:02:38,250
[Laura sighs]

27
00:02:40,541 --> 00:02:42,291
They drowned that woman.

28
00:02:43,041 --> 00:02:44,958
Yeah. I know.

29
00:02:45,041 --> 00:02:46,375
[Laura] They killed her.

30
00:02:47,041 --> 00:02:49,000
Just because she agreed to speak to me.

31
00:02:49,583 --> 00:02:51,416
People are capable of appalling things.

32
00:02:52,541 --> 00:02:56,541
You know what? Just sometimes I would like
them not to do appalling things.

33
00:02:57,041 --> 00:02:59,166
I would like to be surprised.

34
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:02,791
Are we talking about stealing NGO funds
from starving children now

35
00:03:02,875 --> 00:03:04,875
or your checkered romantic history?

36
00:03:04,958 --> 00:03:07,500
Oh. Yes, be serious. Thank you.

37
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,166
[woman] I thought I was.

38
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:12,833
-Ha!
-[phone vibrating]

39
00:03:12,916 --> 00:03:13,916
God.

40
00:03:16,333 --> 00:03:17,833
Oh, speak of the devil!

41
00:03:17,916 --> 00:03:19,625
-[woman] Which devil is that?
-Go away.

42
00:03:19,708 --> 00:03:21,500
-Two disasters ago.
-[woman] Ooh!

43
00:03:22,083 --> 00:03:23,750
-Ben Morgan?
-Ben Morgan!

44
00:03:23,833 --> 00:03:25,583
-[woman] What does he want?
-No idea.

45
00:03:25,666 --> 00:03:28,166
Probably wants to collect
some of his rare Japanese vinyl

46
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:30,125
he's got cluttering up my apartment.

47
00:03:33,166 --> 00:03:34,291
-[sighs]
-[Laura] What?

48
00:03:34,875 --> 00:03:37,375
Lo, you didn't have to come
straight back in today.

49
00:03:38,416 --> 00:03:40,250
-[sighs]
-Take some time off.

50
00:03:40,333 --> 00:03:42,500
I'm… I'm not very good at taking time off.

51
00:03:43,208 --> 00:03:44,333
You should ask Ben.

52
00:03:45,416 --> 00:03:46,458
[sighs]

53
00:03:47,125 --> 00:03:49,041
In that case, what's next?

54
00:03:49,875 --> 00:03:53,333
We have an in on that FIFA corruption
story if you're still interested.

55
00:03:53,416 --> 00:03:54,416
Do you know what?

56
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:56,875
Something has just come in,
which I think might, um…

57
00:03:57,375 --> 00:03:58,916
restore my faith in humanity.

58
00:03:59,416 --> 00:04:01,166
It's Anne Lyngstad, you know?

59
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:04,458
She's the Norwegian shipping heiress.
She's got stage four leukemia.

60
00:04:04,541 --> 00:04:08,000
And her husband is, uh, setting up
a foundation in her name.

61
00:04:08,625 --> 00:04:10,125
Sounds uplifting.

62
00:04:10,625 --> 00:04:12,333
But here's the fun part.

63
00:04:12,833 --> 00:04:15,916
He wants to take the board members
on his fuck-off big yacht

64
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,458
to, uh, a fundraising gala in Norway.

65
00:04:18,541 --> 00:04:21,333
Wants me to come along,
cover it, raise awareness.

66
00:04:23,208 --> 00:04:24,416
Let me get this straight.

67
00:04:24,916 --> 00:04:26,833
This poor woman gets sick,

68
00:04:26,916 --> 00:04:29,875
and now some billionaires
in her circle have decided

69
00:04:29,958 --> 00:04:32,541
cancer's awful
and they should do something about it.

70
00:04:32,625 --> 00:04:35,083
But only if you go
and tell everyone how great they are.

71
00:04:35,166 --> 00:04:37,958
Yes, pretty much.
But obviously with my journalistic flair.

72
00:04:38,041 --> 00:04:39,333
This is a story how?

73
00:04:39,416 --> 00:04:42,000
Oh, come on.
It's human interest for inhumane times.

74
00:04:42,083 --> 00:04:43,208
[woman] Mm.

75
00:04:43,291 --> 00:04:45,041
You just told me I needed a break.

76
00:04:45,125 --> 00:04:48,208
So long as it is a break.
Not a leave of absence.

77
00:04:48,958 --> 00:04:53,000
I am pretty sure hard-hitting journalism
can survive without me for the week.

00:05:28,416 --> 00:05:30,458
Thank you. Thanks.

[woman 1] Welcome aboard
the Aurora Borealis.

82
00:05:33,125 --> 00:05:34,666
[Laura] What a beautiful boat.

83
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:37,291
Uh, so, so… your shoes, Miss Blacklock.

84
00:05:37,375 --> 00:05:38,875
-My--?
-Shoes, yep.

85
00:05:40,625 --> 00:05:41,625
Sorry, what have I done?

86
00:05:41,708 --> 00:05:44,166
We keep all of the shoes
in that basket over there.

87
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:47,208
We can offer you some slippers
or socks or shoes for the gym.

88
00:05:47,291 --> 00:05:49,500
We have your sizes.
So just let us know, okay?

89
00:05:49,583 --> 00:05:50,583
[Laura] Okay. Thanks.

90
00:05:50,666 --> 00:05:52,541
-We all get it wrong first time.
-Yeah.

91
00:05:59,458 --> 00:06:00,958
First time at the rodeo?

92
00:06:01,583 --> 00:06:03,750
I'm not quite up
with the yacht etiquette yet.

93
00:06:03,833 --> 00:06:05,958
I call it yachtiquette, actually.

94
00:06:06,541 --> 00:06:08,208
By the way, I'm Laura. Hello.

95
00:06:08,291 --> 00:06:10,416
-Adam Sutherland.
-[Laura] Nice to meet you.

96
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:12,625
-[woman 2] Champagne, madam?
-Thank you.

97
00:06:13,791 --> 00:06:16,583
[sighs] Way too early for me.

98
00:06:16,666 --> 00:06:18,916
[giggles] Hello, there. Hi.

99
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,708
Hi, I'm Karla. I'm the chief steward.

100
00:06:21,291 --> 00:06:24,833
You will be in cabin 8
on the starboard side. Fantastic sunrises.

101
00:06:24,916 --> 00:06:27,500
Dr. Mehta, you're in cabin 2,
closest to Miss Lyngstad.

102
00:06:27,583 --> 00:06:29,125
-Thank you.
-[Karla] You're welcome.

103
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:32,000
-Are you Miss Lyngstad's doctor?
-Well…

104
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:35,041
I'm an old friend of Richard's, really.

105
00:06:35,875 --> 00:06:38,416
Ever since Anne became ill,
I've, uh, sadly become

106
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:41,541
a somewhat constant presence
in their lives.

107
00:06:42,375 --> 00:06:44,166
She's fought as hard as anyone could.

108
00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:46,208
-All full of contraband?
-Every one of them.

109
00:06:46,291 --> 00:06:47,375
Excuse me.

110
00:06:48,958 --> 00:06:51,291
-Thomas. Heidi.
-[Thomas] Ah!

111
00:06:51,375 --> 00:06:54,208
-[Heidi] Oh, Robert. You old bastard.
-[Robert chuckling]

112
00:06:54,291 --> 00:06:55,750
Wasn't a complete wash.

[intriguing string music playing]

114
00:06:58,958 --> 00:07:00,916
[Thomas] Looking well.
Lost a bit of weight?

115
00:07:01,541 --> 00:07:03,083
[Robert] It's the stress.

116
00:07:05,083 --> 00:07:06,333
[camera shutter clicking]

117
00:07:08,291 --> 00:07:11,958
Of all the superyachts
on all the cruises in all the world.

118
00:07:12,041 --> 00:07:13,125
[Laura] Ben Morgan.

119
00:07:13,208 --> 00:07:16,375
-Oh, I don't believe it. Jesus.
-[Ben] I did try calling you.

120
00:07:16,458 --> 00:07:19,041
Why am I not surprised to see you here?

121
00:07:19,125 --> 00:07:23,125
-Of course! Benjamin. Sh… Uh, this is, um…
-[Ben] Lo and I already know each other.

122
00:07:23,208 --> 00:07:26,625
Oh! Journo circles.
You guys worked together before?

123
00:07:27,916 --> 00:07:29,333
[chuckling] No.

124
00:07:29,416 --> 00:07:32,625
No, you've done something else
together before, haven't you?

125
00:07:32,708 --> 00:07:34,500
Let me know if you need me
to engage a deckhand

126
00:07:34,583 --> 00:07:35,916
to prevent a repeat performance.

127
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,708
[Laura] Won't be necessary. Thank you.

128
00:07:37,791 --> 00:07:39,583
-It ended a while ago.
-Okay.

129
00:07:40,083 --> 00:07:43,583
-Okay, well, I hope it ended amicably.
-Something like that.

130
00:07:44,250 --> 00:07:47,416
That's a no. That's a no. I've…

131
00:07:48,625 --> 00:07:51,541
I've touched a nerve. I do feel awkward.
I might… If you guys--

132
00:07:51,625 --> 00:07:53,708
-I'm gonna…
-Yeah, okay, probably better.

133
00:07:56,708 --> 00:07:58,291
Why is she in jeans?

134
00:07:59,250 --> 00:08:01,208
I feel like there was a dress code, no?

135
00:08:01,291 --> 00:08:03,208
[uneasy string music playing]

136
00:08:12,416 --> 00:08:17,625
That's the first time I've heard you refer
to our shared history as amicable.

137
00:08:18,791 --> 00:08:21,875
It's the first time I've thought about
our shared history at all to be honest.

138
00:08:21,958 --> 00:08:23,000
Ouch.

139
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:24,833
One-nil?

140
00:08:24,916 --> 00:08:25,833
Two-nil.

141
00:08:28,041 --> 00:08:30,166
Okay, I'll take that. I'll take that.

142
00:08:32,666 --> 00:08:35,125
Mr. Tyler, Mr. Jensen.

143
00:08:35,208 --> 00:08:37,166
[uneasy string music continues]

144
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:39,666
And the Heatherleys, and Miss Blacklock.

145
00:08:40,375 --> 00:08:43,750
Ladies and gentlemen, our lovely stewards
will now lead you to your rooms.

146
00:08:43,833 --> 00:08:46,250
Mr. Bullmer will join you
for welcome drinks later.

147
00:08:47,291 --> 00:08:50,750
Laura, have you met Dame Heatherley?
Runs a gallery for the rich and famous.

148
00:08:50,833 --> 00:08:51,958
She used to be in Mayfair.

149
00:08:52,041 --> 00:08:55,750
Now she's decided to migrate east
in search of… [inhales sharply]

150
00:08:55,833 --> 00:08:58,125
…some sort of, um… zeitier-geist, I guess.

151
00:08:58,208 --> 00:09:00,791
-Why did you do that?
-So, so desperately funny, Adam.

152
00:09:00,875 --> 00:09:03,250
Laura is going to be spying on us
<i>dans ze voyage</i>.

153
00:09:03,333 --> 00:09:05,458
Oh, right. So you're Bullmer's journo, eh?

154
00:09:05,541 --> 00:09:07,833
Yeah, Laura. Lo.
Nice to meet you, Dame Heatherley.

155
00:09:07,916 --> 00:09:11,541
Oh, stop it.
Please, would you just call me Heidi?

156
00:09:11,625 --> 00:09:14,125
Uh, my colleague actually
went to see your exhibition.

157
00:09:14,208 --> 00:09:16,500
-She said it was magnificent.
-Oh, it is.

158
00:09:17,166 --> 00:09:20,083
The artist films herself
succumbing to Rohypnol,

159
00:09:20,166 --> 00:09:22,500
then getting dressed and undressed.

160
00:09:22,583 --> 00:09:24,958
Then being put
in various different postures

161
00:09:25,041 --> 00:09:27,625
out in public
over eight hours by her assistants.

162
00:09:27,708 --> 00:09:28,875
Jaw-dropping.

163
00:09:29,375 --> 00:09:31,083
-It sounds…
-Horrendous.

164
00:09:31,166 --> 00:09:34,041
-Even for me. I mean, that is…
-[Heidi] Tommo, you big lug.

165
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,666
Come and meet Richie's hackette.

166
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:38,875
-A journo!
-Mm.

167
00:09:38,958 --> 00:09:42,500
Any good? You know, I've been thinking
about writing my memoirs.

168
00:09:42,583 --> 00:09:45,375
-Ooh, the world awaits with bated breath.
-[Thomas chuckles]

169
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:49,291
[woman] Oh, I'm sorry, Miss Blacklock.

170
00:09:49,375 --> 00:09:51,500
The rest of your luggage
should've been brought down.

171
00:09:51,583 --> 00:09:52,666
Oh, no. That's it.

172
00:09:53,375 --> 00:09:55,750
Oh, uh, would you like me
to unpack for you?

173
00:09:55,833 --> 00:10:00,333
God, no, no.
Um… I wouldn't subject you to the chaos.

174
00:10:01,916 --> 00:10:03,791
[rousing string music playing]

175
00:10:05,041 --> 00:10:06,833
[deep clanking]

176
00:10:09,666 --> 00:10:12,875
All right, boys.
Let's fire it up. Let's go.

177
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:27,041
[ship horn honks]

178
00:10:36,833 --> 00:10:37,833
[woman coughing]

179
00:10:58,208 --> 00:10:59,333
[glass clinking]

180
00:10:59,416 --> 00:11:00,625
[Richard] <i>Friends…</i>

181
00:11:00,708 --> 00:11:02,541
-[woman] That's him.
-Romans.

182
00:11:02,625 --> 00:11:04,083
Board members.

183
00:11:04,166 --> 00:11:05,625
[Heidi] Oh, there we go!

184
00:11:05,708 --> 00:11:07,625
I welcome you to the Aurora Borealis.

185
00:11:07,708 --> 00:11:09,500
[guests] Aurora Borealis!

186
00:11:09,583 --> 00:11:10,875
When we commissioned her,

187
00:11:10,958 --> 00:11:14,166
Anne and I imagined a different future
than the one that has come about.

188
00:11:14,833 --> 00:11:16,833
-Yes.
-[Richard] There's no sugarcoating it.

189
00:11:16,916 --> 00:11:19,208
-Yeah.
-[Richard] That fight has taken its toll.

190
00:11:20,250 --> 00:11:21,541
[inhales deeply]

191
00:11:21,625 --> 00:11:23,166
Anyway, we've…

192
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:27,041
We've rethought the purpose
of this humble barge,

193
00:11:27,125 --> 00:11:28,500
and, uh… [chuckles]

194
00:11:28,583 --> 00:11:30,625
…and you're here
to inaugurate our project.

195
00:11:30,708 --> 00:11:31,666
We are.

196
00:11:32,166 --> 00:11:34,916
Now, I know this is
an unusual approach to charity,

197
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,375
three days on a luxury yacht,

198
00:11:37,458 --> 00:11:41,000
but the money all of you have donated,
which is a considerable amount,

199
00:11:41,583 --> 00:11:43,541
will go to those in society

200
00:11:43,625 --> 00:11:46,791
who cannot afford private doctors
or experimental treatments.

201
00:11:46,875 --> 00:11:47,916
So here's to you.

202
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,041
-To you.
-Hear, hear.

203
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:50,583
-[man] To you.
-Hear, hear.

204
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:54,333
[Richard] Now, I know
most of you are here to meet Anne,

205
00:11:55,041 --> 00:11:58,666
but I'm sorry to say after a long day
of travelling, she's… she's resting.

206
00:11:58,750 --> 00:12:00,750
-So I propose…
-Yes.

207
00:12:00,833 --> 00:12:03,083
…a light supper, an early night,

208
00:12:03,583 --> 00:12:06,041
and a big day of celebration
with Anne tomorrow.

209
00:12:06,125 --> 00:12:07,583
-[Thomas] Oh yes.
-[Heidi] Perfect.

210
00:12:07,666 --> 00:12:09,541
-What do you think?
-[woman] Wonderful.

211
00:12:11,333 --> 00:12:12,333
Mm.

212
00:12:13,250 --> 00:12:14,291
But first,

213
00:12:14,375 --> 00:12:16,375
a nice surprise.

214
00:12:17,041 --> 00:12:18,833
-Come and meet Danny.
-[Heidi] No, it's not…

215
00:12:18,916 --> 00:12:20,916
[rock music blaring from boat]

216
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:24,625
Danny Tyler.
I didn't think he was still alive.

217
00:12:24,708 --> 00:12:26,375
-Just about.
-Not for want of trying.

218
00:12:26,458 --> 00:12:27,916
Danny!

219
00:12:30,791 --> 00:12:31,750
That's amazing.

220
00:12:32,333 --> 00:12:33,458
-Laura Blacklock.
-Hi.

221
00:12:33,541 --> 00:12:34,666
I'm Richard.

222
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:37,166
-So pleased to have you with us.
-Thank you very much.

223
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:40,750
If you're in luck, Tommy,
he'll have brought his Viagra.

224
00:12:40,833 --> 00:12:42,250
[Thomas] Oh, I never use it.

225
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:44,791
There you go. Thank you.

226
00:12:45,625 --> 00:12:47,958
-Bullmer, you old scoundrel.
-[Richard chuckles]

227
00:12:48,041 --> 00:12:49,125
How are you, brother?

228
00:12:49,625 --> 00:12:52,166
-All the better for seeing you.
-How's Anne doing?

229
00:12:52,666 --> 00:12:53,666
She's all right.

230
00:12:55,041 --> 00:12:56,833
-Welcome aboard.
-[Danny] Thank you.

231
00:12:58,166 --> 00:12:59,125
Wow.

232
00:12:59,208 --> 00:13:00,791
Who are you?

233
00:13:00,875 --> 00:13:04,500
Uh, Laura's an award-winning journalist.
She's doing a piece on the foundation.

234
00:13:04,583 --> 00:13:07,541
Shame.
Last thing I need's a fly on the wall.

235
00:13:07,625 --> 00:13:10,791
Thank you.
My mother's a big fan, by the way.

236
00:13:10,875 --> 00:13:12,375
-[Danny] Ouch.
-[Thomas laughs]

237
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:13,625
I like you.

238
00:13:14,833 --> 00:13:17,541
-Now, the big question is, Richard…
-Mm-hmm.

239
00:13:17,625 --> 00:13:20,125
…are we currently in international waters?

240
00:13:20,208 --> 00:13:21,875
'Cause I've got a bag full of drugs

241
00:13:21,958 --> 00:13:24,208
I'd like to share
with these beautiful people.

242
00:13:24,708 --> 00:13:26,791
Not sure I can pay
for another round of rehab--

243
00:13:26,875 --> 00:13:31,166
No, I'm joking, man.
I've been clean and serene since 1917.

244
00:13:31,250 --> 00:13:32,791
[Heidi cackles]

245
00:13:33,458 --> 00:13:36,166
[sighs] Still so hot.

246
00:13:36,958 --> 00:13:39,583
Are you, like, uh,
you know, deep undercover?

247
00:13:40,875 --> 00:13:41,791
Bugger off.

248
00:13:41,875 --> 00:13:45,375
Come on, surely after all
your pontificating about me selling out,

249
00:13:45,458 --> 00:13:49,083
it cannot be that Laura Blacklock is
just here for the money.

250
00:13:49,583 --> 00:13:50,625
There he is.

251
00:13:51,208 --> 00:13:52,875
There's the Ben I remember.

252
00:14:00,666 --> 00:14:02,833
[Laura] <i>I figured out why Ben was calling.</i>

253
00:14:02,916 --> 00:14:04,958
<i>And? How did it go?</i>

254
00:14:05,041 --> 00:14:07,375
-<i>Good surprise or bad?</i>
-[Laura chuckles]

255
00:14:07,458 --> 00:14:08,458
No comment.

256
00:14:08,541 --> 00:14:10,333
<i>Tell me you're not enjoying it a bit.</i>

257
00:14:10,416 --> 00:14:11,875
The champagne is quite good.

258
00:14:11,958 --> 00:14:14,750
[woman] <i>Come on.</i>
<i>You said this was a break. Enjoy yourself.</i>

259
00:14:18,625 --> 00:14:20,791
[Ben] …only together
for nine months, less even.

260
00:14:20,875 --> 00:14:23,041
That's weird.
She doesn't seem like your type.

261
00:14:23,125 --> 00:14:25,250
Come on. That is flattering as hell.

262
00:14:25,333 --> 00:14:26,458
Look at her.

263
00:14:26,958 --> 00:14:29,458
[woman] She's pretty but… a bit boring.

264
00:14:29,541 --> 00:14:30,875
[water trickling]

265
00:14:31,416 --> 00:14:32,708
[Laura exhales heavily]

266
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,208
I'm so sorry.

267
00:14:36,125 --> 00:14:37,041
It's okay.

268
00:14:37,125 --> 00:14:38,583
[uneasy music playing]

269
00:14:38,666 --> 00:14:40,166
Mm… [chuckles nervously]

270
00:14:40,875 --> 00:14:41,875
Sorry!

271
00:14:45,916 --> 00:14:48,875
-[indistinct chatter]
-[enchanting string music playing]

272
00:14:48,958 --> 00:14:52,041
[Adam] Oh yeah? You'd better introduce me.

273
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:53,916
Oh wow.

274
00:14:54,416 --> 00:14:55,416
[Thomas chuckles]

275
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:57,250
[woman 1] What a beautiful dress.

276
00:14:57,333 --> 00:14:59,291
Is there an alfresco opera later?

277
00:14:59,791 --> 00:15:01,250
Sorry. I thought you…

278
00:15:02,125 --> 00:15:04,208
-Bit overdressed. Sorry.
-[Adam] No.

279
00:15:04,291 --> 00:15:07,583
Not at all, love.
You are rockin' that glitter ball.

280
00:15:08,083 --> 00:15:10,750
-[Adam] Do I detect a little jealousy?
-[Richard] You look lovely.

281
00:15:11,250 --> 00:15:12,291
You look great.

282
00:15:12,375 --> 00:15:15,000
-I thought you dressed for dinner and…
-[Ben] It's fine.

283
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:16,791
Shiny.

284
00:15:16,875 --> 00:15:18,166
[strings grow frenetic]

285
00:15:28,666 --> 00:15:30,958
[indistinct lively chatter]

286
00:15:44,583 --> 00:15:45,916
[guests chuckling]

287
00:15:46,458 --> 00:15:47,750
[woman 2] Miss Blacklock,

288
00:15:47,833 --> 00:15:50,083
if after dinner
you could meet Mrs. Lyngstad,

289
00:15:50,166 --> 00:15:51,541
she'd very much appreciate it.

290
00:15:51,625 --> 00:15:53,583
-Oh yeah. Yeah, sure.
-Thank you.

291
00:16:00,916 --> 00:16:02,291
[strings fade out]

292
00:16:02,375 --> 00:16:05,458
I'm Sigrid.
I'm Mr. Bullmer's head of security.

293
00:16:05,541 --> 00:16:07,291
How long have you worked for the family?

294
00:16:08,250 --> 00:16:09,958
[Sigrid] This is my first year.

295
00:16:14,208 --> 00:16:16,166
-Right here.
-Thanks.

296
00:16:18,208 --> 00:16:22,166
If you just… wait here,
Miss Lyngstad will join you shortly.

297
00:16:38,041 --> 00:16:40,041
[sighs] The library.

298
00:16:41,166 --> 00:16:46,250
[chuckles] The one thing on the boat
I insisted on designing myself.

299
00:16:46,333 --> 00:16:50,416
-Miss Lyngstad, thank you for inviting me.
-Call me Anne, please.

300
00:16:50,916 --> 00:16:52,958
I'm so glad you agreed to come.

301
00:16:53,583 --> 00:16:54,916
I follow your work.

302
00:16:55,000 --> 00:17:00,166
Your Guardian exposé on those brave
Kurdish women really stuck with me.

303
00:17:06,916 --> 00:17:08,500
I'm the one who asked for you.

304
00:17:10,208 --> 00:17:14,041
It's important work you do,
giving a voice to the voiceless.

305
00:17:15,833 --> 00:17:17,250
-Thank you.
-[Anne coughs]

306
00:17:21,791 --> 00:17:23,416
Shall I get the doctor?

307
00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:26,791
I… [catches breath]

308
00:17:27,583 --> 00:17:31,291
[exhales deeply]
I… I've stopped all my medication.

309
00:17:32,458 --> 00:17:34,000
My pills, the transfusions.

310
00:17:34,916 --> 00:17:36,250
All of it.

311
00:17:36,333 --> 00:17:39,958
One day I just… couldn't anymore.

312
00:17:41,333 --> 00:17:42,500
[grunts weakly]

313
00:17:46,125 --> 00:17:48,791
It becomes too consuming being a patient.

314
00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:53,000
Without all the drugs
you can really feel it.

315
00:17:54,708 --> 00:17:56,375
Time escaping you.

316
00:17:58,666 --> 00:17:59,666
I'm sorry.

317
00:18:03,666 --> 00:18:07,500
I… I was wondering if I could get
your opinion on something.

318
00:18:09,083 --> 00:18:10,166
Of course.

319
00:18:14,875 --> 00:18:17,250
[Anne] My speech for the gala.

320
00:18:18,083 --> 00:18:21,208
I'd be grateful if you could go over it.

321
00:18:22,291 --> 00:18:24,291
My mind is not what it once was.

322
00:18:24,875 --> 00:18:25,875
[Laura] Yeah.

323
00:18:25,958 --> 00:18:27,958
[delicate string music playing]

324
00:18:42,375 --> 00:18:44,208
You're giving all your money away?

325
00:18:46,333 --> 00:18:47,958
That's very generous. Um…

326
00:18:50,125 --> 00:18:51,833
What brought that on, may I ask?

327
00:18:51,916 --> 00:18:53,708
It's about settling up.

328
00:18:55,625 --> 00:18:57,875
Putting back in what you've taken out.

329
00:19:00,333 --> 00:19:03,666
And over the years we've taken so much.

330
00:19:04,166 --> 00:19:07,708
<i>The foundation will be handed over</i>
<i>to people far smarter</i>

331
00:19:07,791 --> 00:19:11,708
<i>and far kinder</i>
<i>than Richard or I ever were.</i>

332
00:19:14,458 --> 00:19:18,166
[chuckles softly]
Well, it's… it's charity without the ego.

333
00:19:18,916 --> 00:19:21,583
Hard to be egotistical
when you're worm food.

334
00:19:23,791 --> 00:19:24,958
[Anne exhales deeply]

335
00:19:29,083 --> 00:19:33,875
I'd like to continue this tomorrow.
Here perhaps?

336
00:19:34,916 --> 00:19:37,208
I'm happy to help in any way I can.

337
00:19:39,666 --> 00:19:40,666
[Anne] And Laura?

338
00:19:43,625 --> 00:19:44,625
Thank you.

339
00:19:47,708 --> 00:19:48,583
[Laura] Mm.

340
00:19:57,166 --> 00:19:58,291
[door clicks open]

341
00:20:01,791 --> 00:20:04,000
Hey, shining lady.

342
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:06,000
You working the late shift?

343
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:09,041
I could bail if you have
something more fun in mind.

344

[Laura groans]

345
00:20:10,583 --> 00:20:13,416
I try not to make the same mistake twice.

346
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:15,708
-Ouch.
-[chuckles softly]

347
00:20:16,791 --> 00:20:18,708
You were a very good mistake though.

348
00:20:19,416 --> 00:20:20,833
-Yeah?
-Mm-hmm.

349
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:23,208
-Very good?
-Mm.

350
00:20:24,625 --> 00:20:28,541
For me and God knows how many others.

351
00:20:29,083 --> 00:20:30,250
[chuckles]

352
00:20:30,833 --> 00:20:32,041
Oh.

353
00:20:33,291 --> 00:20:34,458
[Ben sighs]

354
00:20:35,875 --> 00:20:36,875
It's okay.

355
00:20:38,708 --> 00:20:41,750
-I'm sorry I was a dick in the end.
-You were a dick in the end.

356
00:20:41,833 --> 00:20:42,958
-I know.
-Mm.

357
00:20:44,208 --> 00:20:45,625
Apology accepted.

[woman] Just stay right there.

381
00:22:33,875 --> 00:22:36,250
It's cabin 8.
She says there's someone in the water.

382
00:22:36,333 --> 00:22:39,333
What? Code Oscar. Code Oscar.
Someone's gone overboard.

383
00:22:39,416 --> 00:22:40,875
[alarm blaring]

384
00:22:42,166 --> 00:22:44,958
Possible M.O.B., starboard side, cabin 10.

385
00:22:45,041 --> 00:22:47,416
10? Reduce speed, switch to manual.

386
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:50,541
Man overboard. Man overboard.
All crew to muster.

387
00:22:55,333 --> 00:23:00,666
<i>Mayday, this is the Aurora Borealis,</i>
<i>requesting urgent assistance.</i>

388
00:23:00,750 --> 00:23:03,708
-[Karla] I haven't woken the passengers.
-[Captain] She's in 8, right?

389
00:23:03,791 --> 00:23:05,000
-[Karla] She is.
-All right.

390
00:23:05,083 --> 00:23:06,791
-I'll leave you to it.
-Thank you.

391
00:23:09,125 --> 00:23:12,166
I heard a splash, went out to the balcony,
and saw somebody in the water.

392
00:23:12,250 --> 00:23:15,000
-We're coming about. We'll find them.
-Who did you see?

393
00:23:15,083 --> 00:23:17,500
Um, I… I don't know.
It was only for a second.

394
00:23:17,583 --> 00:23:20,458
I assume it's the woman next door,
from the cabin there.

395
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:25,000
-From cabin 10?
-[Laura] Yeah.

396
00:23:28,541 --> 00:23:29,541
What's going on?

397
00:23:29,625 --> 00:23:31,958
We've received a report
of a guest falling overboard.

398
00:23:32,041 --> 00:23:32,916
What? Who?

399
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:36,416
I… I don't know.
I think it was a woman, but I don't know.

400
00:23:37,541 --> 00:23:38,625
[Danny] Enter.

401
00:23:40,375 --> 00:23:41,750
Man overboard?

402
00:23:41,833 --> 00:23:43,083
What's happening?

403
00:23:43,833 --> 00:23:44,708
Where's Lars?

404
00:23:44,791 --> 00:23:46,125
Uh, he's in cabin 6.

405
00:23:51,750 --> 00:23:54,125
-Do you know where he is?
-Missing guest from cabin 6.

406
00:23:54,208 --> 00:23:56,541
Lars Jensen. All--
Ooh, ooh, Miss Blacklock.

407
00:23:56,625 --> 00:23:58,625
I have got this under control.
If you could--

408
00:23:58,708 --> 00:24:00,291
Somebody's missing. We have to find them.

409
00:24:00,375 --> 00:24:03,083
What, they're missing?
Sweetheart, have you heard that…

410
00:24:04,625 --> 00:24:06,166
She's not here. I was asleep.

411
00:24:06,250 --> 00:24:08,666
I didn't hear her come back to bed.
You don't think…?

412
00:24:08,750 --> 00:24:10,208
[snoring]

413
00:24:10,291 --> 00:24:11,333
Oh my God.

[man on radio] <i>We've located Mr. Jensen.</i>

415
00:24:18,375 --> 00:24:19,625
[man] Mr. Jensen?

416
00:24:21,791 --> 00:24:22,625
Yes?

417
00:24:22,708 --> 00:24:24,375
So who called the M.O.B.?

418
00:24:24,458 --> 00:24:26,375
Laura Blacklock, the journalist.

419
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:30,541
-And she said it was from cabin 10?
-Yes, sir. That's what's so unusual.

420
00:24:30,625 --> 00:24:33,041
[Richard] Don't worry.
Try to sleep. I'll take care of it.

421
00:24:33,125 --> 00:24:36,000
There was a woman.
She was… [sighs] She was about my height.

422
00:24:36,083 --> 00:24:37,875
She had blonde hair. She had a hoodie on.

423
00:24:37,958 --> 00:24:41,250
She's coming out of the shower.
I was… She…

424
00:24:42,208 --> 00:24:44,708
I came in accidentally.
I was in the corridor, backing in--

425
00:24:44,791 --> 00:24:48,166
There was never a guest staying in here,
Miss Blacklock.

426
00:24:49,541 --> 00:24:51,666
This… This cabin was always empty.

427
00:24:52,708 --> 00:24:55,125
The guest who was supposed
to be in it cancelled two days ago.

428
00:24:58,375 --> 00:25:00,000
-Sh…
-Yes. That's right.

429
00:25:03,541 --> 00:25:05,000
There was blood on the glass.

430
00:25:05,583 --> 00:25:07,500
There was blood out here. There…

431
00:25:10,416 --> 00:25:12,000
[unsettling music intensifies]

432
00:25:12,791 --> 00:25:15,666
There was… There was somebody
on this balcony. There wa…

433
00:25:16,250 --> 00:25:20,083
Wait. No, there was somebody
on the balcony. I can prove it.

434
00:25:22,791 --> 00:25:25,500
The… The boat was moving,
and she was smoking outside,

435
00:25:25,583 --> 00:25:27,375
so I picked up the cigarette…

436
00:25:27,916 --> 00:25:31,875
-What? They're not here.
-The cabins are serviced twice a day, so…

437
00:25:34,708 --> 00:25:36,666
Uh… Look, listen, I am…

438
00:25:36,750 --> 00:25:38,875

00:25:44,458 --> 00:25:46,333
The coast guard.
You called the coast guard?

442
00:25:46,416 --> 00:25:48,333
-[Captain] Of course.
-They'll continue searching?

443
00:25:48,916 --> 00:25:51,625
We've conducted our search, ma'am.
Everyone's accounted for.

444
00:25:52,458 --> 00:25:55,458
There… Someone is out there.
They could still be alive.

445
00:25:55,541 --> 00:25:59,458
I think it's time for everyone
to go back to sleep. It's… rather late.

446
00:26:01,125 --> 00:26:02,375
[Captain] Night, Miss Blacklock.

00:26:03,166 --> 00:26:07,041
-Uh… You ca… You…
-I'm very sorry, Miss Blacklock.

No. Listen. Listen. This is just…

449
00:26:09,916 --> 00:26:11,166
[Captain] Reminder to all crew

450
00:26:11,250 --> 00:26:14,083
that cabin 10 is out of bounds
until we reach port in Norway.

Um, Miss Blacklock, sorry.
Are you sure you're going to be all right?

453
00:26:18,875 --> 00:26:20,250
Can I get you some tea or…?

454
00:26:20,916 --> 00:26:23,500
No? Okay. Just… sleep well.

-[woman] You buzzed?
-Uh…

Yeah, I can't get any internet connection.

463
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:19,333
Oh, I'm so sorry, Miss Blacklock.
But the system's on the fritz.

464
00:27:20,083 --> 00:27:22,083
The techs are looking into it.

-Oh, please. Call me Richard.

00:27:40,583 --> 00:27:42,875
Um, the woman
I saw last night in cabin 10.

470
00:27:42,958 --> 00:27:43,958
Mm.

471
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:48,000
Nothing to be embarrassed about.
You were convinced what you saw was real.

472
00:27:48,083 --> 00:27:50,458
-It was real.
-Oh.

473
00:27:50,541 --> 00:27:54,291
Um, I would like to see the crew.
If one of them is the woman--

474
00:27:54,375 --> 00:27:56,916
Think one of my staff were having
a cheeky shower in cabin 10

475
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,125
when guests were arriving?

476
00:27:59,958 --> 00:28:02,666
The guests are accounted for.
Who else could it have been?

477
00:28:02,750 --> 00:28:04,250
You're right. Let's meet the crew.

[deep thrum of waves]

479
00:28:11,375 --> 00:28:13,375
[Richard]
So, excepting our CTO and captain,

480
00:28:13,458 --> 00:28:16,750
who are naturally at their stations
while we're under sail, this is our crew.

-I'm sorry for the inconvenience--
-See anyone you recognize?

[uneasy string music playing]

483
00:28:37,791 --> 00:28:39,791
I understand the journalistic instinct.

484
00:28:39,875 --> 00:28:41,750
-The CTO?
-[Richard] He's a man.

485
00:28:41,833 --> 00:28:43,375
You're looking for a woman, right?

486
00:28:56,375 --> 00:28:57,500
[music fades out]

487
00:29:04,750 --> 00:29:09,416
-[Laura] I hope they didn't wake you.
-No. I was able to get back to sleep.

488
00:29:11,166 --> 00:29:16,000
Um, is now a good time to, uh…
continue our conversation from yesterday?

489
00:29:16,083 --> 00:29:17,958
Oh, I'm…

490
00:29:18,750 --> 00:29:22,291
I'm feeling a bit too weak,
to be honest. It's…

491
00:29:23,041 --> 00:29:24,625
all this medication.

492
00:29:25,625 --> 00:29:27,708
It really takes it out of me.

493
00:29:30,291 --> 00:29:32,791
I think I need to rest for tonight.

494
00:29:34,041 --> 00:29:35,041
Oh.

495
00:29:36,166 --> 00:29:37,208
I'm sorry.

496
00:29:38,458 --> 00:29:39,833
I hope you feel better.

[sighs]

498
00:29:42,916 --> 00:29:44,916
[Laura] Oh my God.
They all think I'm crazy.

499
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:48,375
No, come on. No one likes being woken up
in the night. They'll get over it.

500
00:29:48,458 --> 00:29:50,083
-I know what I saw.
-It was dark.

501
00:29:50,166 --> 00:29:53,875
No, it wasn't. It wasn't dark
when I saw her in cabin 10. I saw her.

502
00:29:53,958 --> 00:29:56,458
She came out of the shower.
We looked straight at each other.

503
00:29:56,541 --> 00:29:58,541
We even spoke. She spoke.

504
00:29:59,041 --> 00:30:00,875
And now what? She's just disappeared.

505
00:30:01,833 --> 00:30:03,750
What were you doing
in someone else's cabin?

506
00:30:06,791 --> 00:30:08,916
-[Laura] I was avoiding you.
-Huh?

507
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:13,541
You were showing Grace your photographs
in the hallway, and I just…

508
00:30:15,083 --> 00:30:16,625
[Ben chuckles]

509
00:30:16,708 --> 00:30:18,333
-[keyboard clacking]
-Wait.

510
00:30:20,083 --> 00:30:22,000
-You've been taking photos. Give me that.
-Yeah.

511
00:30:22,083 --> 00:30:23,416
Hey, excuse me.

512
00:30:23,916 --> 00:30:25,250
-When we arrived?
-[Ben] Yeah.

513
00:30:25,333 --> 00:30:29,750
If there is a picture of her arriving,
then nobody can deny she exists.

514
00:30:33,875 --> 00:30:36,250
I have to take photos of everyone.
It is what it is.

515
00:30:36,750 --> 00:30:37,750
Huh.

516
00:30:41,458 --> 00:30:43,458
-[Ben] Those are not from the boat--
-Wait. Wow.

517
00:30:43,541 --> 00:30:46,083
You really… You spend
a lot of time with these people.

518
00:30:48,375 --> 00:30:50,875
[intriguing string music playing]

519
00:30:53,708 --> 00:30:56,583
[gasps] Oh my God. That's her.

520
00:30:57,083 --> 00:30:59,500
That's her. That's the woman I saw.

521
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,500
-That is her.
-[Ben] Lo…

522
00:31:01,583 --> 00:31:02,625
[exhales loudly]

523
00:31:02,708 --> 00:31:06,583
Lo, this is a photograph of a stranger,
taken at a party months ago.

524
00:31:07,875 --> 00:31:09,750
-Lo, wait. Hey!
-[camera clicks]

525
00:31:10,625 --> 00:31:13,583
[Ben] Whoa, hey. Slow down.
Let's just discuss the approach.

526
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,083
[Laura] I've found her.

527
00:31:17,916 --> 00:31:19,833
The woman in cabin 10.

528
00:31:21,541 --> 00:31:22,541
That's her.

529
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:26,250
-What photo is this?
-[Ben] Uh, it's from May, I think.

530
00:31:26,333 --> 00:31:29,250
-The thing Adam threw at the Groucho.
-Oh yeah. That was a fun one.

531
00:31:29,833 --> 00:31:31,500
I'm sorry. This is a picture of…

532
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,333
a woman who looks like the woman
you say you saw in cabin 10?

533
00:31:34,416 --> 00:31:37,791
No, that is the woman I saw
at a party thrown by one of your guests.

534
00:31:37,875 --> 00:31:38,833
Right.

535
00:31:38,916 --> 00:31:40,041
Who is she?

536
00:31:41,541 --> 00:31:42,916
Adam, do you know?

537
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,458
I don't know. What?

538
00:31:44,958 --> 00:31:46,625
[Adam groans]

539
00:31:46,708 --> 00:31:48,583
No. Never seen her before.

540
00:31:48,666 --> 00:31:50,625
You're in a photograph with her.

541
00:31:50,708 --> 00:31:51,958
Okay. Well…

542
00:31:52,041 --> 00:31:53,958
I don't know.
Dozens of women look like that.

543
00:31:54,041 --> 00:31:55,958
Most women… all women. She's just a woman.

544
00:31:56,041 --> 00:31:58,541
Adam does seem to surround himself
with a certain type.

545
00:31:58,625 --> 00:32:00,541
-[Richard chuckles]
-[Adam] Thank you, Tommo.

546
00:32:00,625 --> 00:32:02,166
Nobody asked your opinion.

547
00:32:02,250 --> 00:32:03,416
You know what?

548
00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:04,916
Uh… [smacks lips]

549
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:05,958
[tauntingly] Lo.

550
00:32:06,041 --> 00:32:07,166
Laura.

551
00:32:07,708 --> 00:32:10,000
I have no idea who this person is.

552
00:32:10,083 --> 00:32:12,000
-All right?
-[laptop snaps closed]

553
00:32:13,791 --> 00:32:18,708
Laura, I'm sure what you experienced
yesterday was very traumatic for you.

554
00:32:19,583 --> 00:32:22,083
But am I right in thinking

555
00:32:22,166 --> 00:32:25,458
that it was only a couple of months ago
you witnessed a murder?

556
00:32:26,458 --> 00:32:28,708
-[Laura yells] Elena!
-[indistinct shouting]

557
00:32:28,791 --> 00:32:30,375
[loud, distorted rumbling]

558
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,375
Um… Sorry, um…

559
00:32:37,875 --> 00:32:39,416
How'd you know about that?

560
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:41,083
[uneasy string music playing]

561
00:32:41,916 --> 00:32:44,625
Rowan told me what happened
to that woman you interviewed.

562
00:32:45,583 --> 00:32:48,500
-Why would you tell them?
-I was worried about you, Lo.

563
00:32:49,291 --> 00:32:52,666
It's not uncommon for images to resurface,

564
00:32:52,750 --> 00:32:56,291
especially in those minutes
between sleep and wake.

565
00:32:56,375 --> 00:32:59,000
-[Grace] Poor thing.
-[Danny] You just gotta go with it, girl.

566
00:32:59,083 --> 00:33:02,750
I've always got little people dancing
on the edge of my vision.

567
00:33:02,833 --> 00:33:04,458
It's kind of beautiful.

568
00:33:05,375 --> 00:33:06,791
God, I don't believe this.

569
00:33:06,875 --> 00:33:08,791
[Grace] Don't be embarrassed, babe.
It's fine.

570
00:33:08,875 --> 00:33:10,791
[Heidi] Adam. Tell the truth.

571
00:33:10,875 --> 00:33:12,875
Did you bring a stowaway on board?

572
00:33:12,958 --> 00:33:15,416
-[Adam] Yeah, I was going to but then…
-[audio distorts]

573
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:16,500
[exhales heavily]

574
00:33:17,916 --> 00:33:19,750
Laura, if it's any help,

575
00:33:19,833 --> 00:33:22,708
I can have Sigrid try and track down
this woman in the photograph.

576
00:33:23,625 --> 00:33:26,750
But I must ask you to be mindful
of what this journey is.

577
00:33:26,833 --> 00:33:28,333
For me, for my wife,

578
00:33:28,416 --> 00:33:29,791
and my guests.

579
00:33:29,875 --> 00:33:34,041
Look, I… I think it's important
that you can feel relaxed here.

580
00:33:35,916 --> 00:33:36,875
Sig!

581
00:33:37,625 --> 00:33:40,125
Can we book Miss Blacklock in at the spa?

582
00:33:40,208 --> 00:33:41,625
Just something soothing.

583
00:33:41,708 --> 00:33:43,541
-I think that might be…
-[Sigrid] Sure.

584
00:33:44,041 --> 00:33:45,541
…might be helpful. Yeah?

585
00:33:58,500 --> 00:34:01,000
[woman] <i>This is a mixture of volcanic ash,</i>

586
00:34:01,083 --> 00:34:03,666
subarctic peat, and natural oils.

587
00:34:04,541 --> 00:34:07,250
When you shower,
they'll be activated by the heat.

588
00:34:08,291 --> 00:34:10,291
It soothes the muscles,

589
00:34:10,375 --> 00:34:11,916
relieves tension.

590
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,750
-[gurgling scream]
-[Laura gasps]

591
00:34:14,375 --> 00:34:15,791
[catches breath]

592
00:34:18,416 --> 00:34:19,750
[grunting softly]

593
00:34:20,458 --> 00:34:22,208
[haunting music playing]

594
00:34:23,958 --> 00:34:25,750
[footsteps treading]

595
00:34:25,833 --> 00:34:26,833
[gasps]

596
00:34:34,250 --> 00:34:35,250
[music intensifies]

597
00:34:42,458 --> 00:34:44,583
-[woman] Is everything okay?
-Who was in this room?

598
00:34:44,666 --> 00:34:46,250
-When?
-What? Just now.

599
00:34:46,333 --> 00:34:48,250
Just w-w-when I was in the shower.

600
00:34:49,083 --> 00:34:50,083
Was it you?

601
00:34:50,166 --> 00:34:52,750
I had to send towels to the laundry.
Did something happen?

602
00:34:52,833 --> 00:34:55,625
-Did you write something?
-Oh, hey.

603
00:34:56,250 --> 00:34:57,833
Mm. Muddy. [chuckles]

604
00:34:57,916 --> 00:34:59,250
Were you in my room?

605
00:34:59,916 --> 00:35:02,166
-Excuse me, in your room?
-The treatment room.

606
00:35:02,791 --> 00:35:03,791
[scoffs]

607
00:35:04,291 --> 00:35:08,958
Uh, no, I just got out the sauna,
and I was planning on going for a massage.

608
00:35:09,458 --> 00:35:10,791
If that's okay.

609
00:35:12,541 --> 00:35:15,041
You're obsessed with me,
aren't you? [sucks teeth]

610
00:35:15,708 --> 00:35:17,583
[menacing music playing]

611
00:35:17,666 --> 00:35:20,541
-I need to look at the CCTV.
-What would you like to see?

612
00:35:20,625 --> 00:35:23,833
The spa. Um, anyone who came in or out
in the last 20 minutes.

613
00:35:23,916 --> 00:35:26,916
Sorry, but we turn off CCTV everywhere
when guests are on board.

614
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,291
-Sorry? The cameras are off?
-[Captain] Yeah.

615
00:35:30,041 --> 00:35:31,041
Who ordered that?

616
00:35:31,125 --> 00:35:34,250
It's quite normal on a boat
with so many high-profile guests.

617
00:35:34,333 --> 00:35:37,625
-They find it easier to relax if--
-They know they aren't being watched.

618
00:35:39,833 --> 00:35:41,291
[water trickling]

619
00:35:48,500 --> 00:35:50,500
[breathing heavily]

620
00:35:54,625 --> 00:35:55,750
[gasps]

621
00:36:02,708 --> 00:36:04,625
-[indistinct voices]
-Shit.

622
00:36:06,833 --> 00:36:07,833
[sighs]

623
00:36:23,791 --> 00:36:26,000
[menacing music intensifies]

624
00:36:37,833 --> 00:36:38,875
Oh shit.

625
00:36:46,958 --> 00:36:48,333
[whimpers]

626
00:36:56,750 --> 00:36:58,625
[panting] Oh my God.

627
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,083
[exhales deeply]

628
00:37:25,458 --> 00:37:27,791
They said nobody has been
in that cabin, right?

629
00:37:27,875 --> 00:37:29,250
This is the maiden voyage.

630
00:37:29,333 --> 00:37:31,500
If no one was in that cabin,
whose hair is this?

631
00:37:31,583 --> 00:37:32,833
[inhales deeply, sighs]

632
00:37:32,916 --> 00:37:35,791
Whoever's hair this is,
they went overboard.

633
00:37:35,875 --> 00:37:37,750
I get it. You may not like these people--

634
00:37:37,833 --> 00:37:42,583
Listen, I am… I am not having
a some sort of post-traumatic episode.

635
00:37:42,666 --> 00:37:46,875
-I am… I am not imagining things.
-No, I'm not trying to say you are, Lo.

636
00:37:46,958 --> 00:37:49,291
I'm saying
you don't need to be the one who fixes it.

637
00:37:50,125 --> 00:37:51,708
[sighs sharply] Look.

638
00:37:53,208 --> 00:37:57,208
For the next, what, 36 hours,
we're stuck on board.

639
00:37:58,166 --> 00:38:01,583
If Nilssen doesn't find the girl
and you still feel like this when we dock,

640
00:38:01,666 --> 00:38:05,541
I'll go with you to the police to report
a missing woman with that hair you have.

641
00:38:05,625 --> 00:38:08,875
But pushing this further now
is not helping your situation.

642
00:38:10,833 --> 00:38:12,625
[Ben] These people run the world.

643
00:38:12,708 --> 00:38:15,375
Or the very least have lunch dates
with the ones who do.

644
00:38:15,458 --> 00:38:17,000
If you piss them off…

645
00:38:17,500 --> 00:38:19,416
[ominous music playing]

646
00:38:42,416 --> 00:38:43,791
[Grace] You've had quite a day.

647
00:38:44,375 --> 00:38:45,541
How are you doing?

648
00:38:46,625 --> 00:38:48,041
Come here. Help me with this.

649
00:38:51,125 --> 00:38:53,458
[Laura] So how did, uh, you and Lars meet?

650
00:38:55,791 --> 00:39:00,125
His board were getting concerned that
the whole incel Caesar vibe was passé.

651
00:39:00,208 --> 00:39:03,250
They thought a weekend away with me,
glimpsed on my socials,

652
00:39:03,333 --> 00:39:05,333
might convince shareholders
they're being led

653
00:39:05,416 --> 00:39:07,666
by the right type of red-blooded alpha.

654
00:39:07,750 --> 00:39:11,500
-Wait, so you're not actually to--
-[Grace] Absolutely not. Purely optics.

655
00:39:12,125 --> 00:39:14,250
To be honest,
I don't think he likes women.

656
00:39:14,333 --> 00:39:15,458
It's kind of creepy.

657
00:39:16,708 --> 00:39:18,708
Do you want a selfie? No charge.

658
00:39:18,791 --> 00:39:20,833
Come on. Boost your socials.

659
00:39:22,125 --> 00:39:23,333
-Ready?
-[camera clicks]

660
00:39:23,416 --> 00:39:24,625
Cute.

661
00:39:26,375 --> 00:39:28,250
You know, I really admire what you do.

662
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:31,791
I think I could've been a journalist,
if I hadn't been so…

663
00:39:31,875 --> 00:39:33,833
[clicks tongue] …you know.

664
00:39:36,958 --> 00:39:38,958
[unsettling string music playing]

665
00:39:40,416 --> 00:39:42,666
[Richard] The thing is
the sum is the problem.

666
00:39:42,750 --> 00:39:45,083
[guests chatter indistinctly]

667
00:39:47,375 --> 00:39:49,791
[Heidi] So you're allowed to drink
on the job, are you?

668
00:39:51,625 --> 00:39:52,958
Well, good for you.

669
00:39:53,625 --> 00:39:58,250
You know, back in the 90s, I worked
for this fabulous gallery in Mayfair.

670
00:39:58,333 --> 00:40:03,666
Lunch was an absolute
duel to the death by martini.

671
00:40:05,041 --> 00:40:06,875
Do you often sleep in the bathtub?

672
00:40:09,500 --> 00:40:11,708
-Only when we've had a brawl.
-[Laura] Huh.

673
00:40:12,500 --> 00:40:13,750
What are the brawls about?

674
00:40:13,833 --> 00:40:16,458
Honestly, neither of us
can ever remember in the morning.

675
00:40:17,458 --> 00:40:20,625
-And there's rarely any bruises, so…
-[Thomas] And if there are…

676
00:40:21,666 --> 00:40:22,750
they're mine.

677
00:40:23,958 --> 00:40:25,166
[both chuckle]

678
00:40:25,250 --> 00:40:27,250
Oh, can I fix your collar, babe?

679
00:40:28,458 --> 00:40:30,041
[hushed] I really wouldn't pry too much.

680
00:40:30,125 --> 00:40:33,000
You don't want to get

the story behind all this, that, uh…

693
00:41:15,958 --> 00:41:18,416
I wanted to give Anne
a reason to keep fighting.

694
00:41:19,208 --> 00:41:24,458
To make something so beautiful and…
that she would feel the same way I do.

695

to leave this world without…

Danny could've pushed someone?

-[Heidi scoffs]
-Maybe.

-Yeah, could I?

the other one came back into the cabin.

You were asleep.

You were walking around, dreaming,

just made the whole thing up.

So drop it.

1022
01:04:05,583 --> 01:04:08,666
Don't think I'm stupid enough to believe
that was the only woman you did that to?

1023
01:04:08,750 --> 01:04:09,625
Richard, please.

1024
01:04:09,708 --> 01:04:13,333
How many others would've come out
of the woodwork had I not buried it?

1025
01:04:13,416 --> 01:04:14,958
You wouldn't have just been struck off.

1026
01:04:15,041 --> 01:04:17,041
You would've spent
your fucking life in prison.

1027
01:04:17,125 --> 01:04:19,416
Look, I appreciate
everything that you have done.

1028
01:04:19,500 --> 01:04:22,708
I know, but we're not forgetting
our arrangement, are we?

1029
01:04:23,625 --> 01:04:24,625
No.

1030
01:04:27,500 --> 01:04:28,625
[inhales deeply]

1031
01:04:30,541 --> 01:04:31,583
I'll take care of her.

1032
01:04:36,250 --> 01:04:37,166
Thanks, Robert.

1033
01:04:40,791 --> 01:04:42,833
[breathing heavily]

1034
01:04:46,375 --> 01:04:47,708
[Richard exhales slowly]

1035
01:04:59,791 --> 01:05:04,541
You have to go to the police. You have
to tell them everything that you told me.

1036
01:05:04,625 --> 01:05:08,541
I can't. They'll arrest me too.
I'm an accomplice.

1037
01:05:08,625 --> 01:05:11,958
Someone got killed.
They'll take my daughter away from me.

1038
01:05:12,041 --> 01:05:15,541
I just need to sign what he wants me
to sign and turn up at that gala.

1039
01:05:15,625 --> 01:05:18,875
You really think
that he's going to let you go alive?

1040
01:05:18,958 --> 01:05:21,916
Carrie, he'll get rid of you.
You know that.

1041
01:05:23,666 --> 01:05:25,333
Do they know that I'm down here?

1042
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:28,708
They don't know where you are,
but they're looking.

1043
01:05:32,125 --> 01:05:33,250
How long before we dock?

1044
01:05:34,041 --> 01:05:37,416
About two hours. I'll leave the door open.

1045
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:40,291
-It gives you a chance.
-Look, Carrie.

1046
01:05:41,250 --> 01:05:43,750
Nothing's going to happen
until you've signed that will.

1047
01:05:44,708 --> 01:05:45,958
Bullmer needs you alive.

1048
01:05:47,333 --> 01:05:50,833
But after you've done what he wants,
you're in danger.

1049
01:05:50,916 --> 01:05:52,083
[inhales sharply]

1050
01:05:54,375 --> 01:05:55,958
I'm going to get to you.

1051
01:05:57,041 --> 01:05:58,041
I promise.

1052
01:05:58,666 --> 01:05:59,666

1057
01:06:40,833 --> 01:06:42,791
-[Adam] Hey, Lars, Lars.
-Oh yeah.

1058
01:06:43,375 --> 01:06:46,583
Did you…
By the way, did you download my album?

1059
01:06:46,666 --> 01:06:50,125
I feel like saying, "Three times,
Karla, is probably too many."

1060

[door thuds]

1061
01:06:51,916 --> 01:06:53,916
-[Robert] This is the last room.
-[man] It is, sir.

1062
01:07:10,375 --> 01:07:13,958
Oh, Mr… Mr. Morgan, Dr. Mehta has asked
that we allow her to rest.

1063
01:07:14,041 --> 01:07:16,916
Apparently she was in a state last night.
He's given her sedatives.

1064
01:07:18,166 --> 01:07:20,916
-Just let her know I stopped by, okay?
-Of course.

1065
01:07:21,416 --> 01:07:22,416
Thank you.

1066
01:07:23,291 --> 01:07:24,250
[Karla] Mm.

1068

-[Richard] Ah, Ben.
-Hey.

1069
01:07:38,375 --> 01:07:41,041
Thank you so much
for your presence these past few days.

1070
01:07:41,125 --> 01:07:42,083
Yeah.

1071
01:07:42,166 --> 01:07:44,000
Can't wait to see
what you snap at the gala.

1072
01:07:44,083 --> 01:07:45,583
[Ben] Sure. I, uh…

1073
01:07:46,916 --> 01:07:48,125
I'm worried about Lo.

1074
01:07:48,750 --> 01:07:50,208
[Richard] Yeah, yeah, me too.

1075
01:07:50,291 --> 01:07:52,458
Well, she couldn't be
in better hands though.

1076
01:07:52,541 --> 01:07:54,583
Money couldn't buy
a better doctor, trust me.

1077
01:07:54,666 --> 01:07:57,875
He's agreed to stay with her
until she's well enough to join us later.

1078
01:07:58,375 --> 01:08:01,666
Uh… Stopped a little short, no?

1079
01:08:02,291 --> 01:08:05,000
Well, shallow water means
we can't stop any closer.

1080
01:08:05,500 --> 01:08:08,208
The only downside to having
such a large boat.

1081

01:08:23,291 --> 01:08:26,666
It has been our absolute pleasure
hosting you all these past few days.

1085
01:08:26,750 --> 01:08:29,041
-I look forward to seeing you soon.
-[Adam] Thank you.

1086
01:08:29,125 --> 01:08:30,375
-[Karla] Goodbye.
-I'm sorry.

1087
01:08:30,458 --> 01:08:32,041
-Ben?
-[Karla] Goodbye, sir.

1088
01:08:32,541 --> 01:08:36,583
It's just Lo. Doesn't feel right
leaving her here. I'll follow later.

1089
01:08:38,208 --> 01:08:41,500
[Adam] Can we, um…
Can we maybe go, please?

1090
01:08:41,583 --> 01:08:43,583
-I am freezing.
-[Grace] Shut up, Adam.

1091
01:08:43,666 --> 01:08:45,083

-[Robert] Laura.
-Hello?

1099
01:09:22,333 --> 01:09:24,208
[Robert] Thank God we found you.

1100
01:09:24,958 --> 01:09:27,000
Everyone's been so worried.

1101
01:09:28,125 --> 01:09:29,208
You stay away from me.

1102
01:09:29,291 --> 01:09:32,416
I… I just want to make sure you're okay.
I mean, you…

1103
01:09:32,500 --> 01:09:34,750
-I'm fine.
-You've been missing for over a day.

1104
01:09:34,833 --> 01:09:35,833
[Laura] I'm fine.

1105
01:09:37,916 --> 01:09:40,833

you haven't hurt yourself.

01:10:39,166 --> 01:10:40,125
What was in it?

1113
01:10:42,208 --> 01:10:43,166

-[Robert] <i>He tried to attack me.</i>

1133

<i>it was unavoidable.</i>

-You stow the bodies?
-It's just him. Lo jumped into the water.

1135

she wouldn't have made it.

You understand?

<i>She's about to sign the will.</i>

1141
01:14:08,291 --> 01:14:11,583

you get rid of her.

01:14:33,291 --> 01:14:37,541
[in English] I was, uh, just commenting
on the… sudden change of heart

1145
01:14:38,333 --> 01:14:40,666
after all the work on the foundation.

1146
01:14:41,625 --> 01:14:43,541
-Sure.
-Well…

1147
01:14:43,625 --> 01:14:48,125
My husband's been by my side
all these difficult years, so…

1148
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:52,333
On reflection, I decided on
a more reasonable solution.

01:15:00,625 --> 01:15:01,750
Yeah.

01:15:07,791 --> 01:15:08,916
[Richard] You feeling weak?

1154
01:15:09,750 --> 01:15:11,750
Do you need Dr. Mehta
to give you something?

1155
01:15:13,416 --> 01:15:14,416
No.

1156
01:15:20,666 --> 01:15:21,750
I feel fine.

Take your pick.

1159

I'll do the talking tonight.
All you have to do is smile and wave.

Please. Anne is dead.

I just saw Anne with her lawyers.

1167
01:16:42,041 --> 01:16:43,458
[Laura] Did she change her will?

1168
01:16:44,708 --> 01:16:47,125
Did she sign all her money
over to Bullmer?

1169
01:16:48,708 --> 01:16:51,208
Anne told me
that she was disinheriting him.

1170
01:16:51,291 --> 01:16:56,083
The night you took me to her,
that's the night that Anne went overboard.

1171
01:16:56,166 --> 01:16:57,333
Bullmer killed her.

1172
01:16:58,125 --> 01:17:00,750
That woman has been impersonating
her ever since.

1173
01:17:00,833 --> 01:17:02,041
Bullmer paid her to do it.

1174
01:17:02,125 --> 01:17:03,250
Look. Look.

1175
01:17:04,958 --> 01:17:09,000
Read it. It's the speech
Anne intended to give tonight.

today to be a day of joy,

1190
01:18:10,500 --> 01:18:11,625
not sadness.

1191
01:18:11,708 --> 01:18:13,250
To see it as a beginning.

1192
01:18:13,833 --> 01:18:18,708
Anne's grandfather started
a small shipping enterprise 70 years ago.

1193
01:18:18,791 --> 01:18:22,708
And to think where we are now,
setting up the Lyngstad Foundation,

1194
01:18:22,791 --> 01:18:24,625
with the intention of giving back.

1195
01:18:26,291 --> 01:18:27,416
If he were here,

1196
01:18:27,500 --> 01:18:31,416
I'm sure Alfred would be very proud
of… of all Anne's achievements.

1197
01:18:31,500 --> 01:18:34,583
And I will certainly pr…
I… I'm sorry. What are you…?

1198
01:18:34,666 --> 01:18:36,333
[Laura] Sorry for the interruption,

1199
01:18:36,416 --> 01:18:40,041
but Anne Lyngstad has asked me
to make sure her story is told properly.

1200
01:18:40,791 --> 01:18:44,291
-Just a second, everybody. We'll, uh…
-Um, will you let me speak?

1201
01:18:44,375 --> 01:18:47,208
-What's going on?
-Ridiculous. This woman is delusional.

1202
01:18:47,291 --> 01:18:49,625
-She spent the last four days--
-Let her speak.

1203
01:18:50,125 --> 01:18:51,500
[hushed chatter]

1204
01:18:52,833 --> 01:18:54,500
[Thomas] What's going on, Richard?

1205
01:18:55,250 --> 01:18:57,791
That's enough.
Please take her up to the house.

1206
01:18:57,875 --> 01:18:59,458
I said, let her speak.

1207
01:18:59,541 --> 01:19:02,083
Darling, it's very kind of you
to take pity on her--

1208
01:19:02,166 --> 01:19:03,291
I want her to speak.

1209
01:19:03,375 --> 01:19:05,291
I don't want her to ruin this celebration.

1210
01:19:06,041 --> 01:19:09,333
-[Carrie] Take your hands off my guest.
-[Richard] Take her. Do as I say.

1211
01:19:09,416 --> 01:19:11,666
[Heidi] Yeah, Richard.
Anne wants her to speak.

1212
01:19:11,750 --> 01:19:14,500
-Would you let the woman go?
-Yes, it's her party after all.

1213
01:19:14,583 --> 01:19:17,125
You heard Miss Lyngstad. Let her go.

1214
01:19:17,708 --> 01:19:18,708
Thank you.

1215
01:19:22,791 --> 01:19:26,333
This is the document
that Anne Lyngstad gave me four days ago.

1216
01:19:26,416 --> 01:19:29,041
-The speech she planned to give.
-This woman is unhinged.

1217
01:19:29,125 --> 01:19:31,208
Anne, will you let me read it
for you, please?

1218
01:19:31,291 --> 01:19:32,333
Yes, please.

1219
01:19:32,416 --> 01:19:35,583
-I'm warning you. Do not do this.
-[Heidi] Would you just let her speak?

1220
01:19:36,083 --> 01:19:40,875
"On my death, my remaining business
interests and capital will be liquefied."

1221
01:19:40,958 --> 01:19:43,666

into the Lyngstad Foundation."

1225
01:19:53,833 --> 01:19:56,500
will henceforth no longer be involved
with the foundation."

1226
01:19:56,583 --> 01:19:57,916
-[Richard] This is a lie.
-Richard.

1227
01:19:58,000 --> 01:20:01,416
[Richard] She's written that herself.
She's trying to create a scandal.

1228
01:20:01,500 --> 01:20:03,666
-Are these your words, Anne?
-Yes, they are.

1229
01:20:04,375 --> 01:20:07,083
Who do you think you are?
You think you can do this to me?

1230
01:20:07,166 --> 01:20:09,625
Do what? We're just telling the truth,
aren't we, Anne?

1231
01:20:09,708 --> 01:20:10,541
Yes, Laura.

1232
01:20:10,625 --> 01:20:13,250
Now you've heard your wife's wishes,
haven't you?

1233
01:20:13,333 --> 01:20:15,083
What you're doing is not smart.

1234

I think perhaps we call it a day.

1237

We'll find another opportunity
to… to finish. Anne's feeling--

1238
01:20:27,708 --> 01:20:29,958
I'm feeling a lot better, actually.

1239
01:20:33,125 --> 01:20:34,291

And where's the real Anne?

1243

Is there something else
you want to tell your guests?

1244
