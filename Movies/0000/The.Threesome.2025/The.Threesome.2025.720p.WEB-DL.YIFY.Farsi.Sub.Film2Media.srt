18
00:01:26,708 --> 00:01:28,042
I'm genuinely
excited to hear why

19
00:01:28,125 --> 00:01:30,209
you're the sole person
already eating dinner.

20
00:01:30,292 --> 00:01:32,625
I have to go back to work.
I drew the short straw.

21
00:01:32,708 --> 00:01:34,459
Can't leave before
the best part.

22
00:01:34,542 --> 00:01:36,792
That's why I'm eating it now.

23
00:01:36,875 --> 00:01:39,125
I'm about to give my toast.

24
00:01:39,208 --> 00:01:40,459
Hmm.

25
00:01:40,542 --> 00:01:41,542
Good for you.

26
00:01:41,625 --> 00:01:42,625
I get it.

27
00:01:42,708 --> 00:01:43,959
You have your makeup on.

28
00:01:44,042 --> 00:01:46,625
You don't want to
cry before work.

29
00:01:46,708 --> 00:01:48,292
I hope you wrote jokes
as funny as the idea

30
00:01:48,375 --> 00:01:50,709
of me crying at your toast.

31
00:01:50,792 --> 00:01:52,750
Only one way to find out.

32
00:01:54,542 --> 00:01:57,875
But then came Matthew's
new assignment,

33
00:01:57,958 --> 00:02:00,083
18 months in Omaha.

34
00:02:02,375 --> 00:02:05,917
Where he apparently
made exactly one friend.

35
00:02:07,375 --> 00:02:10,125
I got home to find Greg on
the floor of our living room

36
00:02:10,208 --> 00:02:11,542
trying not to freak out,

37
00:02:11,625 --> 00:02:13,792
listening to a
Dalai Lama YouTube,

38
00:02:13,875 --> 00:02:16,709
which wasn't really helping

39
00:02:16,792 --> 00:02:19,209
because the Lama's never
even had a boyfriend,

40
00:02:19,292 --> 00:02:22,750
much less cross state
lines to live with him.

41
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:30,917
Now, Greg was terrified

42
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,375
that Matthew would learn
exactly who he really was,

43
00:02:34,458 --> 00:02:37,292
and not just trivial stuff like

44
00:02:37,375 --> 00:02:39,000
how he makes up random facts

45
00:02:39,083 --> 00:02:41,875
like Mark Twain
inventing the bra strap.

46
00:02:41,958 --> 00:02:43,625
No, he did.

47
00:02:43,708 --> 00:02:48,125
He literally did, and he
invented standup, Google it.

48
00:02:48,208 --> 00:02:52,459
So, I said to
Greg, stay with me,

49
00:02:52,542 --> 00:02:54,875
stay here, and don't worry

50
00:02:54,958 --> 00:02:57,375
about getting your heart broken.

51
00:02:57,458 --> 00:02:59,792
'Cause if there's one
thing I know about Greg

52
00:02:59,875 --> 00:03:03,125
is that he will always
do the exact opposite

53
00:03:03,208 --> 00:03:04,750
of what I suggest.

54
00:03:05,833 --> 00:03:09,042
So, Greg was in
Omaha the next month,

55
00:03:09,125 --> 00:03:11,375
and the rest is history,

56
00:03:11,458 --> 00:03:15,459
which I think proves
what I've long believed.

57
00:03:15,542 --> 00:03:18,375
That Dalai Lama sucks.

58
00:03:20,083 --> 00:03:23,292
Or instead,

59
00:03:23,375 --> 00:03:26,042
a heart that's afraid to break

60
00:03:26,125 --> 00:03:28,667
is a heart that's never used.

61
00:03:30,042 --> 00:03:31,334
To Greg and Matt.

62
00:03:31,417 --> 00:03:34,208
To Greg and Matt!

63
00:04:23,708 --> 00:04:27,042
My baby boy has come to visit!

64
00:04:27,125 --> 00:04:28,209
How was the honeymoon?

65
00:04:28,292 --> 00:04:29,792
Dude, I'm a tapped keg.

66
00:04:29,875 --> 00:04:31,625
Remember like the
beaches, the food,

67
00:04:31,708 --> 00:04:33,667
the rich Cuban culture.

68
00:04:35,125 --> 00:04:36,375
-You son of a bitch.
-What?

69
00:04:36,458 --> 00:04:37,959
I thought that you
were here to see me.

70
00:04:38,042 --> 00:04:39,125
I am here to see you.

71
00:04:39,208 --> 00:04:40,667
Okay, you know what
I want from you?

72
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:43,875
I want you to accept what you
have with Olivia, all right?

73
00:04:43,958 --> 00:04:45,542
You guys are
friends, friends-ish,

74
00:04:45,625 --> 00:04:47,042
friends adjacent, ex-coworkers.

75
00:04:47,125 --> 00:04:50,125
These are all really special
beautiful categories.

76
00:04:50,208 --> 00:04:52,917
And as much as I fucking
try, no one can take away

77
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,542
that little drunken hump
sesh that you two had.

78
00:04:54,625 --> 00:04:56,625
Look, I don't care
for your tone, Greg.

79
00:04:56,708 --> 00:05:01,250
And it was one drunken,
love-making session.

80
00:05:01,333 --> 00:05:03,292
Did you come when
you had sex with her?

81
00:05:03,375 --> 00:05:05,209
Because I don't hear
any post-nut clarity.

82
00:05:05,292 --> 00:05:06,542
Connor, God, I hate to be blunt,

83
00:05:06,625 --> 00:05:08,959
but it's time to throw
in the towel, honestly.

84
00:05:09,042 --> 00:05:11,459
Greg is a married man
now, you need to move on.

85
00:05:11,542 --> 00:05:13,209
I don't give up that easy.

86
00:05:13,292 --> 00:05:15,167
Even when I'm literally
begging him to.

87
00:05:16,375 --> 00:05:18,125
So, your toast was a hit, huh?

88
00:05:18,208 --> 00:05:20,042
It was all right.
No, it was good.

89
00:05:20,125 --> 00:05:21,250
You hook up with anyone?

90
00:05:21,333 --> 00:05:22,875
I mean, that's how you
know if it was good.

91
00:05:22,958 --> 00:05:24,209
I mean, it was a gay wedding.

92
00:05:24,292 --> 00:05:25,709
And straight single girls

93
00:05:25,792 --> 00:05:28,125
famously can't
stand gay guys, so.

94
00:05:28,208 --> 00:05:29,542
Yeah, not this gay guy.

95
00:05:29,625 --> 00:05:31,000
They actually find
me really offensive.

96
00:05:31,083 --> 00:05:32,584
Yeah, but only half
the guests were yours.

97
00:05:32,667 --> 00:05:34,250
All I'm hearing is this
is your own special way

98
00:05:34,333 --> 00:05:35,459
of saying you're
happy to see me.

99
00:05:35,542 --> 00:05:37,042
Really, is it?

100
00:05:37,125 --> 00:05:38,917
And please keep in mind, the
customer is always right.

101
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
And please keep in mind,

102
00:05:41,083 --> 00:05:43,542
you're Greg's
customer, not mine.

103
00:05:43,625 --> 00:05:45,542
Thank you.
-Yep.

104
00:05:45,625 --> 00:05:47,000
Bye.

105
00:05:48,375 --> 00:05:51,292
Listen, buddy, I know it
feels really romantic to pine,

106
00:05:51,375 --> 00:05:54,750
but it is a super
short walk to creepy.

107
00:05:55,958 --> 00:05:58,917
What'd you do, bring the
whole house in your bag?

108
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,083
Hey.

109
00:06:07,125 --> 00:06:08,209
My hands are dirty.

110
00:06:08,292 --> 00:06:09,292
I'm gonna go wash
them real quick.

111
00:06:09,375 --> 00:06:10,500
I'll be right back.

112
00:06:10,583 --> 00:06:12,625
Can you give us some
bread sticks? Thank you.

113
00:06:12,708 --> 00:06:14,375
-What are you doing here?
-She insisted on coming.

114
00:06:14,458 --> 00:06:15,625
-Really?
-Tell your chef to stop

115
00:06:15,708 --> 00:06:16,709
making such good food.

116
00:06:16,792 --> 00:06:17,750
We make chicken fingers.

117
00:06:17,833 --> 00:06:19,125
You came to fuck
with me like a child

118
00:06:19,208 --> 00:06:21,375
after I very gently
ghosted you like an adult.

119
00:06:21,458 --> 00:06:23,292
If seeing me out with
my wife fucks with you,

120
00:06:23,375 --> 00:06:24,417
that's not my problem.

121
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:25,875
Don't twist my words.

122
00:06:25,958 --> 00:06:27,292
Who is she talking to?

123
00:06:27,375 --> 00:06:28,625
No idea.

124
00:06:28,708 --> 00:06:30,042
But you know what's a
more interesting idea?

125
00:06:30,125 --> 00:06:31,542
Look over there at that table.

126
00:06:31,625 --> 00:06:32,959
You see her?

127
00:06:33,042 --> 00:06:34,625
Do you know her?

128
00:06:34,708 --> 00:06:37,459
-No, but you're about to.
-I'm really not in the mood.

129
00:06:37,542 --> 00:06:39,042
Look, she just got stood up.

130
00:06:39,125 --> 00:06:40,959
She's waiting for a
handsome young fella

131
00:06:41,042 --> 00:06:42,125
to go over there
and talk to her.

132
00:06:42,208 --> 00:06:43,459
And since that's not happening,

133
00:06:43,542 --> 00:06:44,792
maybe I could go
over there instead?

134
00:06:44,875 --> 00:06:45,875
I didn't say that at all.

135
00:06:45,958 --> 00:06:47,542
That's all you,
that's all internal.

136
00:06:47,625 --> 00:06:50,709
Look, if you're not gonna do
it for her, do it for Olivia.

137
00:06:50,792 --> 00:06:52,417
Show her that another girl sees

138
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:54,458
how much of a catch you are.

139
00:06:56,333 --> 00:06:57,667
When you told me that
you were married,

140
00:06:57,750 --> 00:06:58,959
I thought you'd be
low maintenance.

141
00:06:59,042 --> 00:07:00,417
Instead, you're this
black hole of needy-ness.

142
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:01,959
Maybe for once, we skip the
mean thing you say to me

143
00:07:02,042 --> 00:07:03,417
that you take back later.

144
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:04,709
You know, the easier
way to skip it

145
00:07:04,792 --> 00:07:05,750
is don't show up at my work.

146
00:07:05,833 --> 00:07:06,959
Thank you guys so
much for coming.

147
00:07:07,042 --> 00:07:09,375
Have a great night.
-Thank you.

148
00:07:09,458 --> 00:07:11,334
Get a real job, maybe
I wouldn't have to.

149
00:07:11,417 --> 00:07:12,542
I'm gonna spit in your food.

150
00:07:12,625 --> 00:07:14,667
-Spit in my mouth.
-Read the room, Kevin.

151
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:15,833
Okay.

152
00:07:18,583 --> 00:07:20,375
Uh, where'd he go? Did he leave?

153
00:07:20,458 --> 00:07:22,833
No, he's just getting started.

154
00:07:25,958 --> 00:07:27,709
Probably nothing.
-Hmm.

155
00:07:27,792 --> 00:07:32,125
So, nowhere else, not
even a study abroad or?

156
00:07:32,208 --> 00:07:33,292
Well, I've actually never

157
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:35,209
not lived in my parents' house.

158
00:07:35,292 --> 00:07:37,542
What? It's practical.

159
00:07:37,625 --> 00:07:39,459
Rent is expensive and I
can commute to college.

160
00:07:39,542 --> 00:07:40,875
It's easy.
-You missed out

161
00:07:40,958 --> 00:07:42,542
on having a terrible roommate
who eats all your food

162
00:07:42,625 --> 00:07:44,042
and leaves her dirty
underwear around.

163
00:07:44,125 --> 00:07:46,459
-I have that, that's my dad.
-Right.

164
00:07:46,542 --> 00:07:49,459
Well, I did have a
buddy that went to UALR.

165
00:07:49,542 --> 00:07:52,542
I actually threw up in
the fountain one visit.

166
00:07:52,625 --> 00:07:54,042
-That's bad.
-Please don't,

167
00:07:54,125 --> 00:07:55,542
don't turn me in.

168
00:07:55,625 --> 00:07:58,125
My loyalty's to my school,
I hope you'll understand.

169
00:07:58,208 --> 00:07:59,459
Of course.

170
00:07:59,542 --> 00:08:01,625
I will not tell you what
happened in the quad then.

171
00:08:01,708 --> 00:08:03,667
It was worse.

172
00:08:16,375 --> 00:08:18,375
Miss, is this man bothering you?

173
00:08:18,458 --> 00:08:19,959
No, no, not at all.

174
00:08:20,042 --> 00:08:22,125
Because he's wanted
in multiple states

175
00:08:22,208 --> 00:08:23,625
for indecent exposure.

176
00:08:23,708 --> 00:08:24,709
-She's kidding.
-Oh.

177
00:08:24,792 --> 00:08:27,875
I am kidding, he's my friend.

178
00:08:27,958 --> 00:08:30,209
He used to work here
back in the day.

179
00:08:30,292 --> 00:08:31,542
That's how we met.

180
00:08:31,625 --> 00:08:33,875
And we had sex
once, technically.

181
00:08:33,958 --> 00:08:35,875
-Why did you add technically?
-Okay.

182
00:08:35,958 --> 00:08:37,042
I love your top.

183
00:08:37,125 --> 00:08:39,542
That is so cute.
-Thank you.

184
00:08:39,625 --> 00:08:42,625
I never really feel like I
have a reason to wear it, so,

185
00:08:42,708 --> 00:08:45,375
Jenny had a pet
rabbit as a child,

186
00:08:45,458 --> 00:08:46,875
which committed suicide.

187
00:08:46,958 --> 00:08:48,209
Oh, well, allegedly.

188
00:08:48,292 --> 00:08:49,542
I wasn't home at the time.

189
00:08:49,625 --> 00:08:51,792
And my dad's story
doesn't really add up.

190
00:08:51,875 --> 00:08:53,959
I haven't ruled
out negligence, so.

191
00:08:54,042 --> 00:08:55,125
I stand corrected.

192
00:08:55,208 --> 00:08:56,625
Her father may have
murdered her rabbit.

193
00:08:56,708 --> 00:08:59,459
But in brighter news,
you play the viola.

194
00:08:59,542 --> 00:09:01,792
I do, I do.

195
00:09:01,875 --> 00:09:05,709
Well, I play the
recorder and my father

196
00:09:05,792 --> 00:09:07,209
murdered my self-confidence.

197
00:09:07,292 --> 00:09:09,625
So, we're modern women
cut from the same cloth.

198
00:09:09,708 --> 00:09:13,292
Connor, you have so
much to learn from us.

199
00:09:13,375 --> 00:09:15,042
Mm-hmm.

200
00:09:15,125 --> 00:09:17,875
We're about to close,
but, you wanna stay?

201
00:09:17,958 --> 00:09:18,959
Yeah, sure.

202
00:09:19,042 --> 00:09:20,459

00:09:20,542 --> 00:09:23,125

I am so glad you
guys talked to me.

216
00:10:40,375 --> 00:10:42,459
I really needed a
night like this.

217
00:10:42,542 --> 00:10:43,625
Why?

218
00:10:43,708 --> 00:10:45,375
Your friends don't dance?

219
00:10:46,375 --> 00:10:50,542
I mean, I don't really
have many friends.

220
00:10:52,208 --> 00:10:54,792
I mean, people I grew up
with, but I don't know.

221
00:10:54,875 --> 00:10:59,459
You grow up and then you
turn turn out different and,

222
00:10:59,542 --> 00:11:01,125
yeah, do you ever
think about like,

223
00:11:01,208 --> 00:11:03,375
who you would become
if you started

224
00:11:03,458 --> 00:11:05,125
hanging around different people?

225
00:11:05,208 --> 00:11:06,459
Hmm.

226
00:11:06,542 --> 00:11:08,000
Yeah, of course.

227
00:11:09,292 --> 00:11:11,334
I'm surrounded by
bad influences.

228
00:11:11,417 --> 00:11:13,292
You guys are cute.

229
00:11:16,792 --> 00:11:20,250
You have plenty of time
to find your people.

230
00:11:21,250 --> 00:11:22,750
And you'll know.

231
00:11:24,542 --> 00:11:27,250
Your hair's in your face.

232
00:11:27,333 --> 00:11:28,584
You know where the bathroom is?

233
00:11:28,667 --> 00:11:31,375
Yeah, it's to the left.

234
00:11:31,458 --> 00:11:33,583
Okay, thank you.

235
00:11:38,583 --> 00:11:40,125
So, what do you think?

236
00:11:46,042 --> 00:11:49,417
What do I think about what?

237
00:12:02,375 --> 00:12:03,833
Should we bang?

238
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:07,625
Yeah.

239
00:12:09,542 --> 00:12:11,750
I can tell she's into it.

240
00:12:16,875 --> 00:12:18,542
All three of us?

241
00:12:19,625 --> 00:12:20,708
Yes.

242
00:12:23,375 --> 00:12:28,542
Or maybe just you and me could?

243
00:12:29,542 --> 00:12:33,042
Connor, meet the moment.

244
00:12:33,125 --> 00:12:35,625
Don't be such a puppy dog.

245
00:12:42,208 --> 00:12:43,292
Okay.

246
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,625
Oh, whoa.

247
00:12:51,708 --> 00:12:53,625
-Hi.
-Hi.

248
00:12:53,708 --> 00:12:54,959
You guys,

249
00:12:55,042 --> 00:12:57,208
you guys gonna ask me
to watch you do it?

250
00:12:59,292 --> 00:13:00,875
No.

251
00:13:00,958 --> 00:13:03,875
But I understand why...

252
00:13:03,958 --> 00:13:06,875
We were just playing a game.

253
00:13:09,625 --> 00:13:11,292
A game?

254
00:13:11,375 --> 00:13:13,292
I like games, what kind of game?

255
00:13:13,375 --> 00:13:15,417
Truth or dare?
-Yeah.

256
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:16,583
Oh.

257
00:13:17,583 --> 00:13:18,792
Have you ever played?

258
00:13:18,875 --> 00:13:19,959
Yeah.

259
00:13:20,042 --> 00:13:21,959
I, well, when I was
in like fifth grade,

260
00:13:22,042 --> 00:13:24,792
I was dared to
eat a raw hot dog.

261
00:13:24,875 --> 00:13:26,584
Oh my God, well
then, that sucks.

262
00:13:26,667 --> 00:13:28,875
-You were just gonna...
-I was gonna do that one.

263
00:13:28,958 --> 00:13:30,958
-Aww.
-Should we play?

264
00:13:32,208 --> 00:13:33,209
I'm down.

265
00:13:33,292 --> 00:13:34,125
Yeah.

266
00:13:34,208 --> 00:13:36,459
Okay, who wants to go first?

267
00:13:36,542 --> 00:13:37,875
I'll go first.

268
00:13:38,875 --> 00:13:40,292
Truth or dare?

269
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:44,458
Um, truth.

270
00:13:47,250 --> 00:13:49,792
Hmm. Okay.

271
00:13:50,792 --> 00:13:53,208
Have you ever kissed a girl?

272
00:13:57,375 --> 00:14:01,958
I mean, like, girls playing,
like when I was little.

273
00:14:05,458 --> 00:14:09,833
Have you ever really,
really, really kissed a girl?

274
00:14:14,125 --> 00:14:15,125
Do you want to?

275
00:14:15,208 --> 00:14:17,125
That's two questions,

276
00:14:19,625 --> 00:14:21,458
which is totally fine.

277
00:14:23,708 --> 00:14:24,792
Yes.

278
00:15:04,542 --> 00:15:06,583
You're a great kisser.

279
00:15:08,958 --> 00:15:10,042
Thank you.

280
00:15:12,042 --> 00:15:13,458
Okay, handsome.

281
00:15:14,458 --> 00:15:15,625
Your turn.

282
00:15:17,458 --> 00:15:18,708
Truth or dare?

283
00:15:20,875 --> 00:15:22,542
Dare.

284
00:15:22,625 --> 00:15:27,292
I dare you to give me the
best kiss you've ever given.

285
00:16:04,958 --> 00:16:06,042
Hmm.

286
00:16:12,958 --> 00:16:17,292
I think it's your turn to ask.

287
00:16:18,375 --> 00:16:20,208
Can I just kiss you?

288
00:17:47,375 --> 00:17:49,459
-Hey.
-Hey.

289
00:17:49,542 --> 00:17:51,292
Hey, how's it going?

290
00:17:51,375 --> 00:17:52,709
It's all right.

291
00:17:52,792 --> 00:17:55,875
Yeah, I don't
usually drink that...

292
00:17:55,958 --> 00:17:58,292
Well, I don't usually drink, so.

293
00:17:58,375 --> 00:18:02,458
But the rest was a
typical Friday, right?

294
00:18:03,708 --> 00:18:06,292
Yeah, she really knows how
to get what she wants, huh?

295
00:18:06,375 --> 00:18:07,792
Yeah.

296
00:18:07,875 --> 00:18:09,250
Yeah, she does.

297
00:18:11,292 --> 00:18:12,375
But I should say, like,

298
00:18:12,458 --> 00:18:14,667
I also wanted it.
-Oh, oh, no, yeah,

299
00:18:14,750 --> 00:18:16,334
I didn't mean it like that.
-And I hope you...

300
00:18:16,417 --> 00:18:17,625
Right.
-Yeah, no, I did.

301
00:18:17,708 --> 00:18:19,625
I also wanted it too.
-Right.

302
00:18:19,708 --> 00:18:21,209
Yeah.

303
00:18:21,292 --> 00:18:22,875
Yeah, last night was,

304
00:18:23,875 --> 00:18:26,167
was really something.

305
00:18:26,250 --> 00:18:28,709
You're, you're a...

306
00:18:28,792 --> 00:18:31,875
beautiful woman.

307
00:18:31,958 --> 00:18:34,709
What am I, what am I saying?

308
00:18:34,792 --> 00:18:36,542
Do you want anything?

309
00:18:36,625 --> 00:18:38,875
I have instant
oatmeal and cereal.

310
00:18:38,958 --> 00:18:40,792
What cereals?

311
00:18:40,875 --> 00:18:43,792
Grape Nuts and Raisin Bran.

312
00:18:43,875 --> 00:18:46,250
Those are the saddest cereals.

313
00:18:46,333 --> 00:18:48,917
I could also offer a shower

314
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:52,042
and/or a cup of tea.

315
00:18:52,125 --> 00:18:53,209
Yeah, that sounds great.

316
00:18:53,292 --> 00:18:54,875
Both, one of each, please.

317
00:18:54,958 --> 00:18:56,125
Great, now we're
getting somewhere.

318
00:18:56,208 --> 00:18:57,792
Look at this. Wow.

319
00:18:57,875 --> 00:18:58,792
What an Airbnb.

320
00:18:58,875 --> 00:19:00,542
Five stars.

321
00:19:00,625 --> 00:19:04,042
Well, yeah, you have a
shower and I'll do the tea.

322
00:19:04,125 --> 00:19:05,875
-Okay, okay.
-All right.

323
00:19:13,042 --> 00:19:16,209
You know, if you were
thinking of showering too

324
00:19:16,292 --> 00:19:19,375
and you wanted to save water,

325
00:19:19,458 --> 00:19:20,708
tea can wait.

326
00:19:43,375 --> 00:19:45,542
♪ Closer to the sun ♪

327
00:19:45,625 --> 00:19:48,209
♪ Just hit 31 ♪

328
00:19:48,292 --> 00:19:50,625

♪ And now it's warm
like bathwater ♪

330
00:19:52,958 --> 00:19:56,375
I brought the tea
anyway, just in case.

331
00:19:56,458 --> 00:19:57,542
Come in.

332
00:20:00,250 --> 00:20:01,542
New contact,

333
00:20:01,625 --> 00:20:04,542
Jenny Threesome.

334
00:20:04,625 --> 00:20:06,042
Okay, we can just
go with Brooks.

335
00:20:06,125 --> 00:20:08,292
Brooks, okay, Brooks.

336
00:20:08,375 --> 00:20:10,458
"Threesome," sorry.

337
00:20:12,542 --> 00:20:15,709
It was nice to meet
you, Jenny, yeah.

338
00:20:15,792 --> 00:20:16,959
I'll give you a call.

339
00:20:17,042 --> 00:20:18,375
Sounds good.

340
00:20:18,458 --> 00:20:20,125
Okay, bye.
-Bye.

341
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,084
-Hi.
-Hi.

342
00:20:41,167 --> 00:20:43,250
I see you've mastered the
art of playing it cool.

343
00:20:43,333 --> 00:20:45,584
I see you've taken my jacket.

344
00:20:45,667 --> 00:20:47,209
I wanna take you on a real date.

345
00:20:47,292 --> 00:20:48,875
Are you seriously not satisfied?

346
00:20:48,958 --> 00:20:50,625
When I was co-sucking
your dick last night,

347
00:20:50,708 --> 00:20:53,250
that wasn't enough... for you?

348
00:20:57,208 --> 00:20:59,209
It was unbelievable.

349
00:20:59,292 --> 00:21:00,959
But forget the sex.

350
00:21:01,042 --> 00:21:02,292
I had an amazing time.

351
00:21:02,375 --> 00:21:04,292
I haven't had that much
fun in a long time.

352
00:21:04,375 --> 00:21:06,542
And don't forget the sex.

353
00:21:09,125 --> 00:21:11,792
Will say, you picked up a
thing or two since last time.

354
00:21:11,875 --> 00:21:13,209
Oh, yeah?

355
00:21:13,292 --> 00:21:14,959
Be still, my heart.

356
00:21:15,042 --> 00:21:16,959
A sexual compliment?

357
00:21:17,042 --> 00:21:19,959
Almost makes me forget
waking up to a cold bed.

358
00:21:20,042 --> 00:21:21,209
You can buy my breakfast.

359
00:21:21,292 --> 00:21:22,792
That's kind of like a date.

360
00:21:22,875 --> 00:21:25,125
I want to buy you
dinner tomorrow night.

361
00:21:25,208 --> 00:21:27,042
-I'm working.
-The next night then.

362
00:21:27,125 --> 00:21:28,792
Final offer.

363
00:21:28,875 --> 00:21:30,209
Unless there's a better night,

364
00:21:30,292 --> 00:21:31,750
in which case that's totally
fine with me as well.

365
00:21:31,833 --> 00:21:33,959
Why do men think that
unwanted persistence

366
00:21:34,042 --> 00:21:35,792
is so charming?

367
00:21:35,875 --> 00:21:36,959
That's fair.

368
00:21:37,042 --> 00:21:41,542
In my defense, I was inside
you like eight hours ago.

369
00:21:46,042 --> 00:21:47,209
Okay, fine.

370
00:21:47,292 --> 00:21:49,417
-Fine?
-Yeah, one date.

371
00:21:50,958 --> 00:21:52,750
I overdressed, didn't I?

372
00:21:52,833 --> 00:21:54,000
What do you mean?

373
00:21:54,083 --> 00:21:55,875
You're saying I under dressed?
Do you want me to change?

374
00:21:55,958 --> 00:21:58,125
You worried the drive-thru
worker will see me?

375
00:21:58,208 --> 00:21:59,459
For your information,

376
00:21:59,542 --> 00:22:01,042
this Taco Bell has an
inside seating area.

377
00:22:01,125 --> 00:22:03,334
Oh, one sec.

378
00:22:03,417 --> 00:22:05,542
Oh, it's my sister.

379
00:22:05,625 --> 00:22:06,709
Hey, what's up?

380
00:22:06,792 --> 00:22:08,709
-Are you almost here?
-Almost where?

381
00:22:08,792 --> 00:22:10,209
Oh.

382
00:22:10,292 --> 00:22:12,459
Like tonight, tonight.

383
00:22:12,542 --> 00:22:13,958
Uh...

384
00:22:15,042 --> 00:22:18,542
Yeah, no, I can be
there in a few hours.

385
00:22:18,625 --> 00:22:20,459
-Olivia!
-I'm kidding.

386
00:22:20,542 --> 00:22:22,292
Oh my God, calm down. Bye.

387
00:22:22,375 --> 00:22:23,625
Connor.

388
00:22:24,833 --> 00:22:28,042
Do you wanna know what's an
amazing first date activity?

389
00:22:28,125 --> 00:22:29,250
Don't touch that.

390
00:22:29,333 --> 00:22:30,667
-I'm here.
-Hey, don't touch that.

391
00:22:30,750 --> 00:22:31,917
Everyone relax, the
situation is under control.

392
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,084
Thank you, hey, who's this?

393
00:22:33,167 --> 00:22:34,250
-Connor.
-Hi.

394
00:22:34,333 --> 00:22:35,584
He's great with kids, probably.

395
00:22:35,667 --> 00:22:37,167
I actually have no idea
now that I say that.

396
00:22:37,250 --> 00:22:38,334
-That's for you.
-Thank you.

397
00:22:38,417 --> 00:22:39,667
Why is Connor in my house?

398
00:22:39,750 --> 00:22:40,750
Remember when you were 16

399
00:22:40,833 --> 00:22:41,750
and you'd babysit
for your neighbor

400
00:22:41,833 --> 00:22:43,167
and you'd bring your friend?

401
00:22:43,250 --> 00:22:46,500
And that friend was a
30-year-old poetry teacher?

402
00:22:46,583 --> 00:22:48,417
Sometimes he was,
thank you, Roger.

403
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:50,334
Okay, weird. But in 30 seconds,

404
00:22:50,417 --> 00:22:51,834
I'm either burning this
place down or leaving.

405
00:22:51,917 --> 00:22:53,250
So, I don't care.
-Okay.

406
00:22:53,333 --> 00:22:54,750
And I guess it was my fault

407
00:22:54,833 --> 00:22:56,250
'cause I only reminded
you, like, four times.

408
00:22:56,333 --> 00:22:58,500
It's okay, apology accepted.

409
00:22:58,583 --> 00:23:01,084
No S-E-X on our
B-E-D, all right?

410
00:23:01,167 --> 00:23:02,375
You don't have to spell bed.

411
00:23:02,458 --> 00:23:03,500
We'll wash the sheets.

412
00:23:03,583 --> 00:23:04,667
Not funny.

413
00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:07,167
How many kids are there?

414
00:23:07,250 --> 00:23:09,417
Okay, well this meeting
of the Babysitters Club

415
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:11,334
is hereby adjourned.

416
00:23:11,417 --> 00:23:12,500
Please keep my children alive.

417
00:23:12,583 --> 00:23:14,334
Don't micromanage us. Bye.

418
00:23:14,417 --> 00:23:16,000
-I love you.
-I love you.

419
00:23:16,083 --> 00:23:18,084
-Bye.
-I don't know you.

420
00:23:18,167 --> 00:23:20,667
All right, kids,
behave yourselves.

421
00:23:20,750 --> 00:23:22,417
You too, Grace and Milo.

422
00:23:26,458 --> 00:23:27,875
Now what?

423
00:23:32,167 --> 00:23:33,917
Grace, let's eat, dinner time.

424
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:37,250
All right.
-All right.

425
00:23:37,333 --> 00:23:38,667
All right, come on.

426
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:39,750
Yeah.

427
00:23:39,833 --> 00:23:42,250
-Whoa!
-Yay!

428
00:23:42,333 --> 00:23:44,125
Oh!

429
00:23:50,667 --> 00:23:55,750
♪ Old McDonald had a farm ♪

430
00:23:55,833 --> 00:24:00,750
♪ E-I-E-I-O ♪

431
00:24:00,833 --> 00:24:02,334
That was pretty good.

432
00:24:02,417 --> 00:24:03,750
And so, who's on the farm?

433
00:24:03,833 --> 00:24:05,917
Is it one of these?
Is it one of these?

434
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,750
Who's that? Horse?

435
00:24:07,833 --> 00:24:08,958
All right.

436
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:15,250
♪ Had a chick ♪

437
00:24:15,333 --> 00:24:18,750

442
00:24:27,083 --> 00:24:28,917
Olivia, get in here.

443
00:24:30,250 --> 00:24:31,667
-What's that?
-What?

444
00:24:31,750 --> 00:24:33,250
That's not the bottle
I told you to open.

445
00:24:33,333 --> 00:24:34,167
That's like $200.

446
00:24:34,250 --> 00:24:36,292
Fuck, I'm sorry, I thought...

447
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,750
You never let up, do you?

448
00:24:46,667 --> 00:24:48,500
That's insane.

449
00:24:48,583 --> 00:24:51,042
I can't believe they do
that every single day.

450
00:24:51,125 --> 00:24:53,917
I felt like I was
in "Uncut Gems."

451
00:24:55,042 --> 00:24:57,959
It's deranged that I
ever did that on my own.

452
00:24:58,042 --> 00:24:59,125
Mm.

453
00:25:00,708 --> 00:25:01,709
Thank you.

454
00:25:01,792 --> 00:25:03,792
We make a good team.

455
00:25:04,875 --> 00:25:07,459
Hey, to unconventional
first dates.

456
00:25:07,542 --> 00:25:10,125
Wow, and their corny toasts.

457
00:25:10,208 --> 00:25:11,459
You can't rag on my toast

458
00:25:11,542 --> 00:25:14,125
when you famously
missed my best one ever.

459
00:25:14,208 --> 00:25:15,959
Now that I think about it,

460
00:25:16,042 --> 00:25:21,042
you did play acoustic guitar
at me on our first date so...

461
00:25:22,042 --> 00:25:23,542
-Which you loved.
-Did not.

462
00:25:23,625 --> 00:25:24,959
-You're a big softie.
-No, I'm not.

463
00:25:25,042 --> 00:25:26,834
-As I've always suspected.
-Okay, fine.

464
00:25:26,917 --> 00:25:28,500
I have many sides.

465
00:25:30,958 --> 00:25:32,625
I hope to get to see 'em all.

466
00:25:36,792 --> 00:25:39,042
You wanna do it on
my sister's bed?

467
00:25:39,125 --> 00:25:41,125
Thought they said no S-E-X.

468
00:25:41,208 --> 00:25:44,458
Good thing I don't
know how to S-P-E-L.

469
00:25:46,958 --> 00:25:49,625
Weirdest thing that
I'm most proud of...

470
00:25:49,708 --> 00:25:50,959
My collar bones.

471
00:25:51,042 --> 00:25:53,042
So, that's what
your face looks like

472
00:25:53,125 --> 00:25:54,209
when you look at yourself,

473
00:25:54,292 --> 00:25:56,459
you think, I love that clavicle?

474
00:25:56,542 --> 00:25:58,292
Yeah, it is.

475
00:25:58,375 --> 00:26:02,125
I weirdly like when people
say I have nice handwriting,

476
00:26:02,208 --> 00:26:04,042
and I pride myself
on being able to read

477
00:26:04,125 --> 00:26:05,375
other people's messy writing.

478
00:26:05,458 --> 00:26:07,709
-Penmanship.
-Yeah.

479
00:26:07,792 --> 00:26:10,042
That's too boring to be weird.

480
00:26:10,125 --> 00:26:12,625
Ah, spoken like someone
who's never felt the rush

481
00:26:12,708 --> 00:26:14,459
of a handwriting compliment.

482
00:26:14,542 --> 00:26:16,375
I once masturbated
to Billy Joel.

483
00:26:16,458 --> 00:26:18,292
What the fuck? On a dare?

484
00:26:18,375 --> 00:26:20,542
No, because he's a fucking poet.

485
00:26:20,625 --> 00:26:23,125
New meaning to
"River of Dreams."

486
00:26:23,208 --> 00:26:24,292
I'm sorry.

487
00:26:24,375 --> 00:26:27,625
Please, I got Best
Eyes and Best Eyebrows,

488
00:26:27,708 --> 00:26:29,625
which are two separate
ones, I'll have you know.

489
00:26:29,708 --> 00:26:30,875
Thank you very much.
-Congratulations.

490
00:26:30,958 --> 00:26:31,875
Yes.

491
00:26:31,958 --> 00:26:33,292
But I was really pissed
because I wanted to get

492
00:26:33,375 --> 00:26:35,625
Best Sense of Humor and
Carver Kazuski got it.

493
00:26:35,708 --> 00:26:37,875
Basically just 'cause of
her dumb Borat impression.

494
00:26:37,958 --> 00:26:38,959
Borat?

495
00:26:39,042 --> 00:26:39,875
That's not even a
hard impression.

496
00:26:39,958 --> 00:26:41,959
No, I am fucking aware.

497
00:26:42,042 --> 00:26:43,875
I remember the first
movie I ever saw,

498
00:26:43,958 --> 00:26:45,625
"Fantasia."
-Never seen it.

499
00:26:45,708 --> 00:26:47,875
It's a Tchaikovsky
classical music piece.

500
00:26:47,958 --> 00:26:50,709
Remember, I was playing
you Tchaikovsky?

501
00:26:50,792 --> 00:26:52,042
From "Fantasia?"

502
00:26:52,125 --> 00:26:53,542
No, it's not from,

503
00:26:53,625 --> 00:26:55,792
it was an original piece of
music and then they decided

504
00:26:55,875 --> 00:26:57,875
to use the music...
-Skip, next movie.

505
00:26:57,958 --> 00:26:59,125
-Okay.
-What's the next one?

506
00:26:59,208 --> 00:27:00,125
I'm bored.

507
00:27:00,208 --> 00:27:02,792
-You ever seen "Shrek 2?"
-Well, yeah.

508
00:27:02,875 --> 00:27:04,542
That's was the best feature
film ever gosh-darn-made.

509
00:27:04,625 --> 00:27:05,959
Oh, I'm sorry, have I seen it?

510
00:27:06,042 --> 00:27:07,125
Only 12 times.

511
00:27:07,208 --> 00:27:09,292
Worst breakup?
-Mm-hmm.

512
00:27:11,708 --> 00:27:15,625
Technically never actually
been broken up with.

513
00:27:15,708 --> 00:27:17,125
Oh, come on.

514
00:27:17,208 --> 00:27:18,375
Leave it to me,

515
00:27:18,458 --> 00:27:19,834
take a couple years off
from the boyfriend game

516
00:27:19,917 --> 00:27:24,000
and I get a guy who's dumped
everyone he's ever dated.

517
00:27:24,083 --> 00:27:25,292
Cool.

518
00:27:29,125 --> 00:27:30,792
I think we both know,

519
00:27:30,875 --> 00:27:34,708
one way or another,
my streak is doomed.

520
00:27:47,375 --> 00:27:50,334
Shit, I meant to
empty out that trash.

521
00:27:50,417 --> 00:27:51,750
I thought you were on the pill.

522
00:27:51,833 --> 00:27:52,959
It's hard to remember.

523
00:27:53,042 --> 00:27:54,959
You know, you have to
take one every single day.

524
00:27:55,042 --> 00:27:56,625
-Uh-huh.
-Yeah.

525
00:27:57,958 --> 00:27:59,042
And...

526
00:28:00,042 --> 00:28:01,542
And?

527
00:28:01,625 --> 00:28:03,209
Are you...

528
00:28:03,292 --> 00:28:05,042
It's not that big of a deal.

529
00:28:06,042 --> 00:28:11,042
It's early enough that I can
take another pill or whatever.

530
00:28:12,208 --> 00:28:13,208
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

531
00:28:14,208 --> 00:28:15,417
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

532
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:16,583
Okay.

533
00:28:26,042 --> 00:28:27,542
And...
-Mm-hmm.

534
00:28:27,625 --> 00:28:30,375
-Um, just checking.
-Yeah.

535
00:28:30,458 --> 00:28:33,208
A pill is what you want.

536
00:28:35,292 --> 00:28:37,792
Can you even imagine?

537
00:28:37,875 --> 00:28:40,709
No, no.

538
00:28:40,792 --> 00:28:44,708
I mean, I can imagine.

539
00:28:49,958 --> 00:28:51,792
What's happening right now?

540
00:28:51,875 --> 00:28:53,125
I don't know.

541
00:28:53,208 --> 00:28:57,417
I just, after the initial
terror subsided, obviously,

542
00:28:57,500 --> 00:28:59,375
I had this strange moment
when I saw the box.

543
00:28:59,458 --> 00:29:02,042
Like, am I supposed
to be terrified

544
00:29:02,125 --> 00:29:06,792
because it's unexpected
or ahead of schedule?

545
00:29:07,792 --> 00:29:10,709
'Cause like is it, is it even?

546
00:29:10,792 --> 00:29:12,042
Yeah, it is.

547
00:29:12,125 --> 00:29:13,583
Olivia, I'm 30.

548
00:29:14,875 --> 00:29:17,375
I was eight when my mom was 30.

549
00:29:17,458 --> 00:29:20,292
My dad had abandoned the whole
family by the time he was 30.

550
00:29:20,375 --> 00:29:22,125
I mean, I'm lagging.

551
00:29:25,792 --> 00:29:26,792
That's crazy.

552
00:29:26,875 --> 00:29:28,167
All this time, we thought, like,

553
00:29:28,250 --> 00:29:30,750
I was the "out there"
one, but clearly...

554
00:29:31,750 --> 00:29:34,209
Connor, we've never even said...

555
00:29:34,292 --> 00:29:35,583
I love you.

556
00:29:40,792 --> 00:29:44,417
I guess it would be rude
of me not to confess

557
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:45,667
that I...

558
00:29:47,458 --> 00:29:51,458
I do love you too, I do.

559
00:29:53,458 --> 00:29:55,625
But that doesn't mean that we
need to do something bonkers

560
00:29:55,708 --> 00:29:57,375
that we can never,
ever take back.

561
00:29:57,458 --> 00:29:59,292
You love me?

562
00:29:59,375 --> 00:30:01,292
You're gonna make me
instantly regret saying that,

563
00:30:01,375 --> 00:30:02,375
aren't you?

564
00:30:02,458 --> 00:30:03,709
So, okay.

565
00:30:03,792 --> 00:30:07,125
Just to recap,

566
00:30:07,208 --> 00:30:08,209
you're pregnant.

567
00:30:08,292 --> 00:30:10,709
-Yeah.
-And we love each other.

568
00:30:10,792 --> 00:30:12,042
And we've been
together for six weeks.

569
00:30:12,125 --> 00:30:14,542
Yeah, but I didn't
meet you six weeks ago.

570
00:30:14,625 --> 00:30:15,959
You're great with kids.

571
00:30:16,042 --> 00:30:17,875
Don't you ever think
about being a mom?

572
00:30:17,958 --> 00:30:18,959
-Someday.
-Someday?

573
00:30:19,042 --> 00:30:20,375
-Yeah, someday.
-Someday,

574
00:30:20,458 --> 00:30:22,959
like someday this Fall?
-Someday like in five years.

575
00:30:23,042 --> 00:30:25,625
Connor, I like,
just can't believe

576
00:30:25,708 --> 00:30:28,250
that you're even
considering this right now.

577
00:30:28,333 --> 00:30:31,625
I can't either, but all I
know is my heart sank more

578
00:30:31,708 --> 00:30:36,208
when you mentioned the pill
and when I saw that box.

579
00:30:39,458 --> 00:30:41,709
Um, I can't think right.

580
00:30:41,792 --> 00:30:45,625
Can, yeah, I just have
a... let me think about it.

581
00:30:45,708 --> 00:30:47,625
-Think about it?
-Yeah.

582
00:30:47,708 --> 00:30:49,042
-All right.
-Yeah, it's a lot.

583
00:30:49,125 --> 00:30:50,375
-I can work with that.
-Okay.

584
00:30:50,458 --> 00:30:51,542
Okay.

585
00:30:53,292 --> 00:30:56,292
Baby steps.

586
00:30:56,375 --> 00:30:57,458
Sorry.

587
00:30:59,042 --> 00:31:02,042
When you picture what you
want your life to be like,

588
00:31:02,125 --> 00:31:03,708
what do you see?

589
00:31:05,625 --> 00:31:08,375
What kind of question is that?

590
00:31:08,458 --> 00:31:10,042
You wanna know mine?

591
00:31:10,125 --> 00:31:12,083
It's you and me, and kids,

592
00:31:13,083 --> 00:31:14,625
whenever that is.

593
00:31:19,458 --> 00:31:22,209
Okay, well, let's
make a pact then.

594
00:31:22,292 --> 00:31:25,709
When we're 86, if
we're still single.

595
00:31:25,792 --> 00:31:27,459
-All right, don't even try.
-Okay, 85.

596
00:31:27,542 --> 00:31:29,125
You said you love me.

597
00:31:29,208 --> 00:31:31,167
You can't pretend anymore.

598
00:31:42,708 --> 00:31:45,625
Maybe I like yours too.

599
00:31:54,583 --> 00:31:56,000
Do you mean...?

600
00:31:58,667 --> 00:32:00,167
Yes, dummy.

601
00:32:09,292 --> 00:32:11,792
She asks a lot of questions,
but it'll be fine.

602
00:32:11,875 --> 00:32:12,959
Just in and out.

603
00:32:13,042 --> 00:32:14,292
Stick to the plan.

604
00:32:14,375 --> 00:32:15,625
Just saying hi, okay?
-Okay.

605
00:32:15,708 --> 00:32:16,959
-Wait.
-What?

606
00:32:17,042 --> 00:32:18,334
Do you think you should
have worn baggier clothes?

607
00:32:18,417 --> 00:32:19,500
I got a hoodie.
-No, it's fine.

608
00:32:19,583 --> 00:32:21,209
Stop it, relax. It's
just a friendly visit.

609
00:32:21,292 --> 00:32:22,732
I'm not gonna drop
any bombs tonight.

610
00:32:24,875 --> 00:32:26,042
I'm sorry, I panicked.

611
00:32:26,125 --> 00:32:27,875
I don't know why
I just said that.

612
00:32:27,958 --> 00:32:29,042
Is she taking it well?

613
00:32:29,125 --> 00:32:30,667
I can't tell.
-Hard to say.

614
00:32:30,750 --> 00:32:33,042
She just shoot herself?

615
00:32:33,125 --> 00:32:36,042
I'm gonna be a grandma!

616
00:32:36,125 --> 00:32:37,292
What's the gender?
-We don't know.

617
00:32:37,375 --> 00:32:38,709
-What's the due date?
-Not sure.

618
00:32:38,792 --> 00:32:40,459
-When's the wedding?
-Mom, there's no wedding.

619
00:32:40,542 --> 00:32:42,500
-Do you need any care taking?
-Maybe.

620
00:32:42,583 --> 00:32:44,959
I'm free on Tuesdays and
Thursdays after 1:20.

621
00:32:45,042 --> 00:32:46,250
-We'll talk about it.
-And some Saturdays.

622
00:32:46,333 --> 00:32:47,250
Thank you, mom.

623
00:32:47,333 --> 00:32:48,334
What are you gonna name it?

624
00:32:48,417 --> 00:32:49,375
Mom.

625
00:32:49,458 --> 00:32:51,875
What are we gonna name our kid?

626
00:32:51,958 --> 00:32:54,292
What about Alice?

627
00:32:55,292 --> 00:32:57,042
As in Wonderland?

628
00:32:57,125 --> 00:33:00,959
Well, no, it was
my mom's mom's name

629
00:33:01,042 --> 00:33:02,958
and I always liked it.

630
00:33:04,208 --> 00:33:05,959
Hmm, I don't know.

631
00:33:06,042 --> 00:33:07,834
-Oh, okay.
-No, it reminds me

632
00:33:07,917 --> 00:33:10,459
of this girl named Alice
from my high school.

633
00:33:10,542 --> 00:33:13,375
Always ate cans
of tuna for lunch.

634
00:33:13,458 --> 00:33:15,542
And I'm like, no,
not even with mayo.

635
00:33:15,625 --> 00:33:16,709
And it wasn't a poverty thing.

636
00:33:16,792 --> 00:33:18,625
She just like,
fucking loved tuna.

637
00:33:18,708 --> 00:33:20,334
It was nauseating.

638
00:33:20,417 --> 00:33:21,583
Jenny?

639
00:33:23,292 --> 00:33:25,292
What are you doing here?

640
00:33:25,375 --> 00:33:27,750
I need to talk to you, Connor.

641
00:33:33,542 --> 00:33:36,042
Well, why, why haven't
you taken care of it?

642
00:33:36,125 --> 00:33:38,542
I just don't think that's
any of your business.

643
00:33:38,625 --> 00:33:40,125
Jenny, are you even
sure it's mine?

644
00:33:40,208 --> 00:33:43,542
Hey, he was using
a condom, remember?

645
00:33:43,625 --> 00:33:44,792
I was there, he used a condom.

646
00:33:44,875 --> 00:33:46,792
Not in the morning.

647
00:33:48,208 --> 00:33:49,667
In the morning?

648
00:33:52,125 --> 00:33:53,542
In the morning.

649
00:33:55,125 --> 00:33:56,208
Okay.

650
00:34:01,542 --> 00:34:02,917
I'm out.

651
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,542
Hey, what do you
mean you're out?

652
00:34:04,625 --> 00:34:07,125
Good luck, kids, this is
one for the storybooks.

653
00:34:07,208 --> 00:34:08,334
What, are you
breaking up with me?

654
00:34:08,417 --> 00:34:09,417
I'm not doing this if there's

655
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:10,750
a side piece, baby
mama, absolutely not,

656
00:34:10,833 --> 00:34:11,625
that is not my life.

657
00:34:11,708 --> 00:34:12,834
But we can get through this.

658
00:34:12,917 --> 00:34:13,917
-No.
-Right?

659
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,042
Come on, we can, we have to,

660
00:34:15,125 --> 00:34:16,125
we have to get through this.

661
00:34:16,208 --> 00:34:17,709
No, we don't have
to get through this.

662
00:34:17,792 --> 00:34:20,917
I can get out of this and
that's what I'm gonna do.

663
00:34:23,792 --> 00:34:25,625
The fuck is going on?

664
00:34:26,708 --> 00:34:27,792
Hey, will you wait?

665
00:34:27,875 --> 00:34:29,292
You're overreacting.
-Properly reacting.

666
00:34:29,375 --> 00:34:30,875
This is how a normal
person reacts.

667
00:34:30,958 --> 00:34:33,375
This has nothing to do with us.

668
00:34:33,458 --> 00:34:34,792
This is apocalyptically bad luck

669
00:34:34,875 --> 00:34:36,459
from before we even
had our first date.

670
00:34:36,542 --> 00:34:38,209
And if I had known that
you'd fucked somebody else

671
00:34:38,292 --> 00:34:39,459
an hour before you'd
asked me out on it,

672
00:34:39,542 --> 00:34:40,625
I would've stuck with no.

673
00:34:40,708 --> 00:34:43,125
You did know. It was your idea.

674
00:34:43,208 --> 00:34:45,292
One hour, eight hours, what
difference does it make?

675
00:34:45,375 --> 00:34:47,042
The difference is that
I can't have your baby

676
00:34:47,125 --> 00:34:48,875
if you're already having
a baby with somebody else,

677
00:34:48,958 --> 00:34:49,959
obviously.

678
00:34:50,042 --> 00:34:51,375
Olivia.

679
00:34:51,458 --> 00:34:53,292
Olivia, please, don't do this.

680
00:34:53,375 --> 00:34:55,125
Get the fuck out of the way!

681
00:35:04,458 --> 00:35:06,625
I'm gonna go.

682
00:35:06,708 --> 00:35:08,959
I think this already
went way worse

683
00:35:09,042 --> 00:35:11,375
than I ever expected it to.

684
00:35:12,458 --> 00:35:15,750
What did you want to happen?

685
00:35:19,458 --> 00:35:20,709
I don't know.

686
00:35:20,792 --> 00:35:24,083
I just thought that
you might wanna know.

687
00:35:26,333 --> 00:35:27,417
Yeah.

688
00:35:36,292 --> 00:35:37,375
Okay.

689
00:35:39,708 --> 00:35:40,792
Jenny, we...

690
00:35:43,708 --> 00:35:45,792
We can't have a baby together.

691
00:35:45,875 --> 00:35:47,792
That's insane.

692
00:35:47,875 --> 00:35:49,709
Well, it's my decision

693
00:35:49,792 --> 00:35:53,125
and it was already
really hard to make.

694
00:35:54,125 --> 00:35:57,208
So, I can do it
alone if I have to.

695
00:36:05,708 --> 00:36:10,167
But I also told my parents
that you were my boyfriend.

696
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,375
So...

697
00:36:31,125 --> 00:36:33,292
Hi, leave a voicemail
if you want.

698
00:36:33,375 --> 00:36:35,708
If it's still 2009,
I might listen to it.

699
00:36:42,875 --> 00:36:48,334
So, you had a threesome and
you got both girls pregnant?

700
00:36:48,417 --> 00:36:50,042
Technically, I
just got both girls

701
00:36:50,125 --> 00:36:52,125
from the threesome pregnant.

702
00:36:52,208 --> 00:36:55,209
And the random stranger that
you picked up and raw dogged

703
00:36:55,292 --> 00:36:58,209
happens to be a life-begins-
at-conception evangelical.

704
00:36:58,292 --> 00:37:00,125
I don't know what she is,
but if you're anti-abortion,

705
00:37:00,208 --> 00:37:01,709
you should not be
having three-way.

706
00:37:01,792 --> 00:37:04,625
-That's very true.
-It's false advertising.

707
00:37:04,708 --> 00:37:06,042
There should be
like a sex prenup

708
00:37:06,125 --> 00:37:08,959
to prevent this kind of thing.
-Ooh, yes.

709
00:37:09,042 --> 00:37:10,542
We're having coffee
this weekend.

710
00:37:10,625 --> 00:37:12,625
Oh my God, that's so cute.

711
00:37:12,708 --> 00:37:14,875
Try not to get any of
the baristas pregnant.

712
00:37:14,958 --> 00:37:16,625
You guys are so lucky to be gay.

713
00:37:16,708 --> 00:37:18,292
Can't get anybody pregnant.

714
00:37:18,375 --> 00:37:19,334
Still try.

715
00:37:19,417 --> 00:37:20,625
You do know the sperm of gay men

716
00:37:20,708 --> 00:37:23,292
has the same capabilities
as yours, right?

717
00:37:23,375 --> 00:37:26,125
Look, I didn't even think
I finished inside her.

718
00:37:26,208 --> 00:37:28,125
We were in the shower and I
didn't want to kill the mood.

719
00:37:28,208 --> 00:37:29,459
Go drip water everywhere.

720
00:37:29,542 --> 00:37:33,250
So, I just, you know,
evacuated, tad early.

721
00:37:34,250 --> 00:37:36,459
Okay, so, after thousands
of years of perfection,

722
00:37:36,542 --> 00:37:38,625
the pullout method
has finally failed.

723
00:37:38,708 --> 00:37:41,292
Thanks, thanks, buddy, pilot on.

724
00:37:41,375 --> 00:37:43,792
That's crazy, that
doesn't make any sense.

725
00:37:43,875 --> 00:37:45,292
It's weird.

726
00:37:45,375 --> 00:37:46,792
I spent so much time imagining

727
00:37:46,875 --> 00:37:49,292
what me and Olivia had in store,

728
00:37:49,375 --> 00:37:51,542
so real and clear in my head.

729
00:37:51,625 --> 00:37:55,292
And now it's not gonna
be that way, it's gone.

730
00:37:55,375 --> 00:37:57,500
And I miss it somehow.

731
00:37:58,500 --> 00:38:00,750
I miss things that
didn't even happen.

732
00:38:02,875 --> 00:38:04,917
Do you wanna just throw some
darts at me, let it out?

733
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,084
-Is that okay?
-Yeah.

734
00:38:06,167 --> 00:38:07,875
-All right, here we go.
-Go ahead.

735
00:38:07,958 --> 00:38:10,667
I don't think you're gonna
hit me, I've seen you play.

736
00:38:12,167 --> 00:38:13,792
Hey, come on.

737
00:38:13,875 --> 00:38:15,750
Next round's on me, huh?

738
00:38:15,833 --> 00:38:17,667
Okay, who's pregnant now?

739
00:38:20,042 --> 00:38:25,208
♪ Bring your fine self on home ♪

740
00:38:27,625 --> 00:38:29,250
♪ Ooh ♪

741
00:38:30,292 --> 00:38:31,375
Hi.

742
00:38:31,458 --> 00:38:32,792
I didn't think you'd respond.

743
00:38:32,875 --> 00:38:34,875
Well, it's my birthday

744
00:38:34,958 --> 00:38:38,042
and I'm feeling
particularly vulnerable.

745
00:38:38,125 --> 00:38:39,792
Any chance you have
a pregnancy fetish?

746
00:38:39,875 --> 00:38:42,292
What? What, why? No.

747
00:38:42,375 --> 00:38:43,459
Are you pregnant?

748
00:38:43,542 --> 00:38:45,375
Your face, I was
gonna do a whole bit

749
00:38:45,458 --> 00:38:47,709
pretending that it's yours
but doesn't really work

750
00:38:47,792 --> 00:38:48,959
with a guy who has a vasectomy.

751
00:38:49,042 --> 00:38:51,459
Doesn't really set
the mood either, so.

752
00:38:51,542 --> 00:38:52,792
And you're keeping it?

753
00:38:52,875 --> 00:38:53,959
Fuck, no.

754
00:38:54,042 --> 00:38:55,292
But you know me.

755
00:38:55,375 --> 00:38:57,292
Why do today what you can
put off until tomorrow?

756
00:38:57,375 --> 00:38:59,209
That's not how that saying goes.

757
00:38:59,292 --> 00:39:00,875
I'm not here for
the conversation.

758
00:39:00,958 --> 00:39:02,209
Good.

759
00:39:02,292 --> 00:39:04,917
Because pregnant women
are sexy as fuck!

760
00:39:06,708 --> 00:39:08,375
Since there's only
gonna be one kid now,

761
00:39:08,458 --> 00:39:12,709
maybe I could be twice
the father, you know?

762
00:39:12,792 --> 00:39:14,875
Like, if you've
never sailed before,

763
00:39:14,958 --> 00:39:19,625
it's probably easier to just
steer one boat at a time.

764
00:39:19,708 --> 00:39:22,042
It's a weird analogy, I've
never even sailed, I'm sorry.

765
00:39:22,125 --> 00:39:23,959
Could we not make
jokes about this?

766
00:39:24,042 --> 00:39:25,458
This is my life.

767
00:39:26,542 --> 00:39:27,792
Like, you think I
want to be pregnant

768
00:39:27,875 --> 00:39:30,500
with some random person's baby?

769
00:39:31,542 --> 00:39:34,500
I wanted to do this
when I was ready.

770
00:39:35,625 --> 00:39:38,042
Or like, at least with
someone that I loved.

771
00:39:38,125 --> 00:39:41,792
And here I was thinking that
I'd only ruined my life.

772
00:39:41,875 --> 00:39:43,792
Oh, no, no, I don't
mean it like that.

773
00:39:43,875 --> 00:39:46,125
You were just being
yourself that night.

774
00:39:46,208 --> 00:39:48,459
And I was really trying
to be someone else.

775
00:39:48,542 --> 00:39:52,209
And I think I
overcompensated so much

776
00:39:52,292 --> 00:39:54,292
that I got what I deserved.

777
00:39:54,375 --> 00:39:56,375
But then, why keep it?

778
00:39:57,875 --> 00:40:00,125
It was clearly a mistake.

779
00:40:00,208 --> 00:40:01,292
No one would judge you.

780
00:40:01,375 --> 00:40:04,292
I mean, I would judge me.

781
00:40:04,375 --> 00:40:09,125
It would be one thing if I
actually tried to prevent this

782
00:40:09,208 --> 00:40:10,709
and it happened anyway,

783
00:40:10,792 --> 00:40:13,792
but I didn't do anything
to prevent this.

784
00:40:13,875 --> 00:40:15,875
Like, how could you
call that a mistake?

785
00:40:15,958 --> 00:40:19,708
That literally makes
no sense to me.

786
00:40:20,708 --> 00:40:23,292
But I respect it.

787
00:40:25,542 --> 00:40:29,709
Look, I'm here because I wanna
try and do the right thing,

788
00:40:29,792 --> 00:40:31,708
whatever that may be.

789
00:40:33,208 --> 00:40:35,417
-Can we pray?
-What?

790
00:40:38,375 --> 00:40:39,458
Oh.

791
00:40:40,458 --> 00:40:41,917
Yeah. Now?

792
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,167
-Mm-hmm.
-Yep.

793
00:40:44,250 --> 00:40:45,500
You lead.

794
00:40:45,583 --> 00:40:46,709
Me?

795
00:40:46,792 --> 00:40:48,542
I was hoping you would ask.

796
00:40:51,167 --> 00:40:54,334

797
00:40:54,417 --> 00:40:55,417

798
00:40:55,500 --> 00:40:56,750
Well, I don't know how to pray.

799
00:40:56,833 --> 00:40:59,250

800
00:40:59,333 --> 00:41:00,500
No, I'm messing with you.

801
00:41:00,583 --> 00:41:01,833
Ohh.

802
00:41:03,208 --> 00:41:06,250
That is a relief.

803
00:41:07,250 --> 00:41:09,167
Sorry.

804
00:41:11,167 --> 00:41:12,084
I'm just gonna take this.

805
00:41:12,167 --> 00:41:14,334
-Yeah.
-One sec, I'm sorry.

806
00:41:14,417 --> 00:41:16,667
Yeah.

807
00:41:17,833 --> 00:41:18,917
Hey.

808
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:20,417
If you're trying to
talk me out of it,

809
00:41:20,500 --> 00:41:21,500
just save it, okay?

810
00:41:21,583 --> 00:41:23,917
I don't feel bad about
it and I don't want to.

811
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:27,334
No, no, no. I just
wanna know you're okay.

812
00:41:27,417 --> 00:41:29,250
Yeah, I'm okay, I'm fine.

813
00:41:29,333 --> 00:41:30,667
But I mean, the
only other person

814
00:41:30,750 --> 00:41:32,417
whose responsibility
this is, is yours.

815
00:41:32,500 --> 00:41:36,709
So I'm gonna need you to
like Venmo me or something.

816
00:41:36,792 --> 00:41:38,334
You want me to Venmo
you for an abortion

817
00:41:38,417 --> 00:41:40,084
I don't want to have?

818
00:41:40,167 --> 00:41:42,542
Fuckin' PayPal
then, I don't care.

819
00:41:47,750 --> 00:41:48,833
Fine.

820
00:41:50,167 --> 00:41:51,458
Thank you.

821
00:41:53,583 --> 00:41:56,417
It's on Tuesday, so I'll
let you know the total then.

822
00:41:56,500 --> 00:41:57,500
Okay?

823
00:41:57,583 --> 00:41:58,667
Tuesday?

824
00:41:59,583 --> 00:42:01,584
It's on this, this Tuesday?

825
00:42:01,667 --> 00:42:02,750
Yeah.

826
00:42:02,833 --> 00:42:04,334
Maya and I have to drive
to Illinois though,

827
00:42:04,417 --> 00:42:05,417
so that's fun.

828
00:42:05,500 --> 00:42:07,000
Yay, medieval abortion laws.

829
00:42:07,083 --> 00:42:09,000
Everything is a fiery hellscape.

830
00:42:10,250 --> 00:42:14,417
Olivia, can I just see
you before you go, please?

831
00:42:14,500 --> 00:42:16,334
I'm not changing my
mind. You can go home.

832
00:42:16,417 --> 00:42:17,584
I'm not here to
change your mind.

833
00:42:17,667 --> 00:42:19,084
I'm here to support you.

834
00:42:19,167 --> 00:42:21,000
What, support me, how?
You make a road trip mix?

835
00:42:21,083 --> 00:42:23,334
Look, I can accept you're
not having our baby anymore,

836
00:42:23,417 --> 00:42:25,750
but I can't accept
what's happened to us.

837
00:42:28,083 --> 00:42:29,250
I don't wanna do this right now.

838
00:42:29,333 --> 00:42:30,667
Can we fight about it
when I get back, please?

839
00:42:30,750 --> 00:42:33,084
Just let me take you. Please.

840
00:42:33,167 --> 00:42:34,084
It's my responsibility.

841
00:42:34,167 --> 00:42:35,667
It's not your responsibility.

842
00:42:35,750 --> 00:42:37,417
I'm not some scared sophomore
cheerleader, I'm fine.

843
00:42:37,500 --> 00:42:39,250
Honestly, I don't
need you to take me.

844
00:42:39,333 --> 00:42:40,500
I have Maya.

845
00:42:41,583 --> 00:42:45,084
Maya, wouldn't Roger
rather I took her,

846
00:42:45,167 --> 00:42:46,417
so you can stay?

847
00:42:47,417 --> 00:42:48,750
No.

848
00:42:48,833 --> 00:42:49,917
Okay.

849
00:42:51,667 --> 00:42:53,250
We started this thing together.

850
00:42:53,333 --> 00:42:54,917
We should end it that way too.
-Connor.

851
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:58,708
Please, I want to have
this abortion with you.

852
00:43:10,083 --> 00:43:12,667
I was planning on sleeping
most of the way there anyway.

853
00:43:14,667 --> 00:43:18,083
So if it's, like,
really important

854
00:43:19,083 --> 00:43:20,500
to you, then fine.

855
00:43:20,583 --> 00:43:22,334
I love you.

856
00:43:22,417 --> 00:43:24,917
I love you. Drive safe.

857
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:27,500
And yes, I did make
a road trip mix.

858
00:43:33,167 --> 00:43:35,083
It's nice to see you.

859
00:43:39,417 --> 00:43:41,375

decision right now, right?

But you absolutely
can take the night

00:45:17,917 --> 00:45:19,750

884
00:45:19,833 --> 00:45:20,750
Okay.

00:45:23,417 --> 00:45:26,375
-Okay, sorry.
-Don't be sorry, darling.

888
00:45:28,083 --> 00:45:29,250
Did you know the abortion itself

889
00:45:29,333 --> 00:45:32,417
only takes between
five and 10 minutes?

890
00:45:32,500 --> 00:45:34,000
Isn't that weird?

891
00:45:37,333 --> 00:45:39,167
You carry this thing for weeks,

892
00:45:39,250 --> 00:45:41,917
literally growing inside you.

893
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:43,083
And then...

894
00:45:45,917 --> 00:45:48,583
If it makes you feel better,

895
00:45:50,583 --> 00:45:55,167
my part in making it was
also five to 10 minutes, so.

896
00:45:57,667 --> 00:46:00,417
I don't wanna eat that.

897
00:46:03,042 --> 00:46:04,292
You awake?

898
00:46:07,708 --> 00:46:08,792
Yeah.

899
00:46:10,083 --> 00:46:12,167
Can I come over there?

900
00:46:25,083 --> 00:46:26,667
No funny business.

901
00:46:30,250 --> 00:46:32,208
You're the funny one.

902
00:46:33,500 --> 00:46:35,167
I can only do serious business.

903
00:46:35,250 --> 00:46:38,542
Oh my God, I'm the
funny one, all right.

904
00:46:42,750 --> 00:46:45,250
Permission to kiss
you on the forehead?

905
00:46:53,500 --> 00:46:56,500
Mm, top of the head only.

906
00:46:57,500 --> 00:46:58,583
One peck.

907
00:47:08,833 --> 00:47:10,500
It's gonna be okay.

908
00:47:12,500 --> 00:47:15,917
Can I just, can I
just take a minute?

909
00:47:18,750 --> 00:47:19,833
Yeah.

910
00:47:24,250 --> 00:47:27,417
I don't think that
I wanna do this.

911
00:47:28,833 --> 00:47:29,750
Really?

912
00:47:29,833 --> 00:47:32,917
Does this make me a Republican?

913
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:34,000
No.

914
00:47:39,583 --> 00:47:41,500
No, no, no.

915
00:47:41,583 --> 00:47:43,834
We came 300 miles
for an abortion

916
00:47:43,917 --> 00:47:46,500
and that is what I'm
getting, an abortion.

917
00:47:46,583 --> 00:47:48,250
What? Hey, hey, hang on.

918
00:47:48,333 --> 00:47:49,500
I'm losing my fucking
mind right now.

919
00:47:49,583 --> 00:47:50,500
Hang on.

920
00:47:50,583 --> 00:47:51,750
You just said you
don't want an abortion,

921
00:47:51,833 --> 00:47:53,417
then looked in my face
and changed your mind.

922
00:47:53,500 --> 00:47:55,000
Look, do you not want a baby

923
00:47:55,083 --> 00:47:56,834
'cause you don't want a baby
or because you're mad at me?

924
00:47:56,917 --> 00:47:58,834
Even if it's what I want to do,

925
00:47:58,917 --> 00:48:00,334
it doesn't mean it's
what I should do.

926
00:48:00,417 --> 00:48:02,000
Since when does Olivia
Capitano give a fuck

927
00:48:02,083 --> 00:48:03,167
about what she should do?

928
00:48:03,250 --> 00:48:04,250
Well, maybe Olivia Capitano

929
00:48:04,333 --> 00:48:05,833
doesn't know what
she wants at all.

930
00:48:09,042 --> 00:48:10,375
What do you think she wants?

931
00:48:10,458 --> 00:48:11,917
You claim to know her so well.

932
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:13,000
I think Olivia Capitano...

933
00:48:13,083 --> 00:48:14,750
You can stop that
whole thing now.

934
00:48:14,833 --> 00:48:16,042
Okay, I think that you...

935
00:48:17,167 --> 00:48:18,334
I think if you go in there

936
00:48:18,417 --> 00:48:20,084
and have an abortion,
you won't regret it.

937
00:48:20,167 --> 00:48:22,750
But I think you wanna keep it.

938
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:28,667
So, you're saying keeping it
wouldn't be a huge mistake.

939
00:48:28,750 --> 00:48:31,542
I will make sure it isn't.

940
00:48:31,625 --> 00:48:32,917
Why did you have to go

941
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:35,625
and have the world's most
potent fucking sperm?

942
00:48:38,417 --> 00:48:40,417
A week ago, I can't, really,

943
00:48:40,500 --> 00:48:42,167
it's just like I felt
like I had everything,

944
00:48:42,250 --> 00:48:44,417
I did, I was actually happy.

945
00:48:44,500 --> 00:48:48,417
And if I can hold on to
some of that, then...

946
00:48:50,333 --> 00:48:52,000
Are you sure?

947
00:48:52,083 --> 00:48:53,167
No.

948
00:48:56,417 --> 00:48:58,083
That's my decision.

949
00:49:13,792 --> 00:49:15,417
Let's go home.

950
00:49:16,917 --> 00:49:18,750
♪ People tell me that
I'm not as strong... ♪

951
00:49:18,833 --> 00:49:20,125
Glad you came.

952
00:49:22,333 --> 00:49:24,167
Wanted persistence for the win.

953
00:49:24,250 --> 00:49:25,750
♪ If they don't see me around ♪

954
00:49:25,833 --> 00:49:28,167
♪ You know they think there's
something is wrong with me ♪

955
00:49:28,250 --> 00:49:32,500
It is always hard to
reconcile how cool you are,

956
00:49:32,583 --> 00:49:34,917
but the fact that you listen
to this kind of music,

957
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:36,417
I'm sorry, I...

958
00:49:37,167 --> 00:49:38,333
And skip.

959
00:49:41,625 --> 00:49:42,625
What is this?

960
00:49:42,708 --> 00:49:43,834
What's what?

961
00:49:43,917 --> 00:49:45,500
Who's Kevin Winebar?

962
00:49:45,583 --> 00:49:46,584
Gimme my phone.

963
00:49:46,667 --> 00:49:48,000
His wife's out of
town, no, what is it?

964
00:49:48,083 --> 00:49:50,000
Jesus Christ, we're
in a moving car!

965
00:49:50,083 --> 00:49:52,000
-Don't read my texts.
-Olivia.

966
00:49:52,083 --> 00:49:53,667
You know what, that's it.

967
00:49:53,750 --> 00:49:56,000
What are doing right now?

968
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:59,083
Connor.
-Yeah.

969
00:50:02,750 --> 00:50:03,834
You can't give me shit for this.

970
00:50:03,917 --> 00:50:06,000
We broke up.
-We were in love.

971
00:50:06,083 --> 00:50:08,667
We were having a, we
are having a baby.

972
00:50:08,750 --> 00:50:10,084
And you're already
fucking somebody else?

973
00:50:10,167 --> 00:50:12,250
No, no, no, no, I'm not
fucking somebody else.

974
00:50:12,333 --> 00:50:13,667
I fucked somebody else.

975
00:50:13,750 --> 00:50:14,834
Just because he
wants to do it again

976
00:50:14,917 --> 00:50:16,250
doesn't mean that I want to.

977
00:50:16,333 --> 00:50:17,667
I honestly, I don't.

978
00:50:17,750 --> 00:50:19,334
Sorry, so, I can't
be hurt about it,

979
00:50:19,417 --> 00:50:20,834
'cause it was just the one time?

980
00:50:20,917 --> 00:50:23,584
I'm allowed to try
and feel better.

981
00:50:23,667 --> 00:50:25,084
We're supposed to be
there for each other.

982
00:50:25,167 --> 00:50:27,167
I'm the one who gets to try
and make you feel better.

983
00:50:27,250 --> 00:50:28,417
You got somebody else pregnant.

984
00:50:28,500 --> 00:50:29,417
That was an accident.

985
00:50:29,500 --> 00:50:31,334
We weren't even together yet.

986
00:50:31,417 --> 00:50:33,334
And we're not together now.

987
00:50:33,417 --> 00:50:34,917
Connor, you said that
we could do this trip

988
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:36,000
without you bringing
this shit up

989
00:50:36,083 --> 00:50:37,250
and now you're
bringing this shit up.

990
00:50:37,333 --> 00:50:38,917
I said, I said that
when I saw that box,

991
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:40,167
my life was changed.

992
00:50:40,250 --> 00:50:42,084
Everything I've done since
then has been with you,

993
00:50:42,167 --> 00:50:44,250
and that baby, and the
rest of our lives in mind.

994
00:50:44,333 --> 00:50:46,250
Stupidly, I thought
you were the same.

995
00:50:46,333 --> 00:50:47,334
That other baby's
gonna be around

996
00:50:47,417 --> 00:50:49,000
for the rest of your
life too. So is Jenny.

997
00:50:49,083 --> 00:50:50,084
-Yeah.
-Okay?

998
00:50:50,167 --> 00:50:52,042
Whatever we had before,
it doesn't exist anymore

999
00:50:52,125 --> 00:50:54,125
and it can't come back.
-You can say that again.

1000
00:51:27,667 --> 00:51:29,834
Two girls pregnant?

1001
00:51:29,917 --> 00:51:31,500
Come on, Connor!

1002
00:51:32,917 --> 00:51:35,334
I feel a little bad
for my grandkids,

1003
00:51:35,417 --> 00:51:38,584
because they're inheriting
your moronic genes.

1004
00:51:38,667 --> 00:51:41,084
Well, where'd you think
I got my genes from, huh?

1005
00:51:41,167 --> 00:51:42,333
Touche.

1006
00:51:43,333 --> 00:51:46,500
Coffee with a splash of whiskey.

1007
00:51:46,583 --> 00:51:48,917
Oh, wow, didn't even check
to see if I was joking.

1008
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:51,000
Just sort of dove right in.

1009
00:51:51,083 --> 00:51:52,250
Hmm.

1010
00:51:57,833 --> 00:52:01,584
I'm really sorry
Olivia's pulling away.

1011
00:52:01,667 --> 00:52:04,584
I like her, I really like her,

1012
00:52:04,667 --> 00:52:07,250
but she doesn't
know what she wants.

1013
00:52:07,333 --> 00:52:09,167
She said she wanted us.

1014
00:52:09,250 --> 00:52:12,625
Without any prompting from you.

1015
00:52:12,708 --> 00:52:14,417
You don't think there's a
special someone out there

1016
00:52:14,500 --> 00:52:17,167
for everybody?
-No.

1017
00:52:17,250 --> 00:52:20,667
No, and everybody who does
is a fucking maniac, Connor.

1018
00:52:20,750 --> 00:52:21,875
Or maybe, you know what?

1019
00:52:21,958 --> 00:52:24,167
Actually maybe there is a
perfect person for somebody,

1020
00:52:24,250 --> 00:52:25,917
but the world is so
fucking humongous.

1021
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:27,667
How the fuck are you gonna
find that perfect person?

1022
00:52:27,750 --> 00:52:30,500
So, we're all just
running around unhappy,

1023
00:52:30,583 --> 00:52:32,084
cheating, or getting divorced.

1024
00:52:32,167 --> 00:52:34,834
You literally just got married.

1025
00:52:34,917 --> 00:52:37,000
Gay people are different.

1026
00:52:37,083 --> 00:52:38,417
We are so different.

1027
00:52:38,500 --> 00:52:40,334
We can say marriage is
forever, look at Hugh Jackman.

1028
00:52:40,417 --> 00:52:42,250
But I actually do just
think I can convince her

1029
00:52:42,333 --> 00:52:44,250
that I'm right, and she's wrong.

1030
00:52:44,333 --> 00:52:45,417
Oh my God.

1031
00:52:45,500 --> 00:52:47,750
How did I raise such a man?

1032
00:52:49,333 --> 00:52:50,625
Wonderfully.

1033
00:52:51,625 --> 00:52:53,167
Don't forget,
there's another girl

1034
00:52:53,250 --> 00:52:56,834
who may appreciate your
supportive partner energy

1035
00:52:56,917 --> 00:52:59,000
and you have a
responsibility to her too.

1036
00:52:59,083 --> 00:53:01,542
And to her baby, most of all.

1037
00:53:02,833 --> 00:53:05,000
I actually do think Jenny
has an OBGYN appointment

1038
00:53:05,083 --> 00:53:06,084
coming up.

1039
00:53:06,167 --> 00:53:08,375
Perfect, take her to it.

1040
00:53:09,375 --> 00:53:11,167
What if she gets the wrong idea?

1041
00:53:11,250 --> 00:53:14,584
And I'm like, wanting
to shack up or...

1042
00:53:14,667 --> 00:53:16,000
Take a friend.

1043
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:18,500
This is so exciting.

1044
00:53:18,583 --> 00:53:20,500
Yeah. Thanks for coming.

1045
00:53:20,583 --> 00:53:23,084
Dude, of course,
would never miss this.

1046
00:53:23,167 --> 00:53:25,834
Wait, I never even
really saw her.

1047
00:53:25,917 --> 00:53:27,584
She's beautiful.
-Yeah.

1048
00:53:27,667 --> 00:53:29,750
Is she still up for threesomes?

1049
00:53:29,833 --> 00:53:30,917
Fuck.

1050
00:53:32,250 --> 00:53:33,750
Ugh, fuck.

1051
00:53:33,833 --> 00:53:35,500
That's the mother of my
child, you disgusting animal.

1052
00:53:35,583 --> 00:53:37,000
Don't make me
regret bringing you.

1053
00:53:37,083 --> 00:53:38,334
-Hi.
-Hi.

1054
00:53:38,417 --> 00:53:40,584
-Hey, how's it going?
-Hey, have a seat.

1055
00:53:40,667 --> 00:53:41,875
-It's okay.
-Come on in.

1056
00:53:41,958 --> 00:53:43,417
-Hey.
-Someone else is here.

1057
00:53:43,500 --> 00:53:44,667
Yes, this is Greg.

1058
00:53:44,750 --> 00:53:46,667
-Hi, I'm Greg Demopolis.
-Hi.

1059
00:53:46,750 --> 00:53:48,500
I'm here to support him
while he supports you,

1060
00:53:48,583 --> 00:53:52,250
which I guess means you're
supporting me, if that's cool.

1061
00:53:52,333 --> 00:53:55,000
Do you always bring
an extra person?

1062
00:53:56,250 --> 00:53:57,542
Wait, I like you.

1063
00:53:57,625 --> 00:54:00,125
-Nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you.

1064
00:54:02,583 --> 00:54:04,000
So, like, I hate to
ask because you know,

1065
00:54:04,083 --> 00:54:05,917
it's like, gauche and
reductionist and everything,

1066
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:08,500
but like, what do you do?

1067
00:54:08,583 --> 00:54:12,334
I'm in grad school, but
I work at a soup kitchen.

1068
00:54:12,417 --> 00:54:13,834
Oh, you work at a soup kitchen?

1069
00:54:13,917 --> 00:54:15,709
-Mm-hmm.
-Oh.

1070
00:54:15,792 --> 00:54:17,334
You didn't know what she did?

1071
00:54:17,417 --> 00:54:19,292
She doesn't know
what I do either.

1072
00:54:19,375 --> 00:54:21,375
Aren't you a recording engineer?

1073
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:25,000
Yep.

1074
00:54:25,083 --> 00:54:26,750
It's a non-profit.

1075
00:54:26,833 --> 00:54:30,250
We do like, bag lunches and
hot meals for unhoused people

1076
00:54:30,333 --> 00:54:33,167
and low income
families and stuff.

1077
00:54:33,250 --> 00:54:35,750
Wow, you are making me seem
like more of an asshole

1078
00:54:35,833 --> 00:54:36,834
than usual.

1079
00:54:36,917 --> 00:54:37,917
No.

1080
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:39,292
I just help yuppies
get fucked up.

1081
00:54:39,375 --> 00:54:40,792
You're a drug dealer?

1082
00:54:40,875 --> 00:54:43,334
No, I am a bartender,

1083
00:54:43,417 --> 00:54:45,667
but I work at the place
where you two met, remember?

1084
00:54:45,750 --> 00:54:46,792
Three-way ticket to pound town.

1085
00:54:46,875 --> 00:54:47,875
-Whoa, okay.
-Ohh.

1086
00:54:47,958 --> 00:54:49,500
Too glib there, chief.

1087
00:54:49,583 --> 00:54:51,334
Hey, I don't think you're glib.

1088
00:54:51,417 --> 00:54:54,000
I think you are very
honest and direct.

1089
00:54:54,083 --> 00:54:55,417
-I appreciate that.
-Yeah, it's unique.

1090
00:54:55,500 --> 00:54:56,917
I feel like you give
it to me straight,

1091
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:57,959
you know what I mean?

1092
00:54:58,042 --> 00:55:00,084
All right, not totally straight.

1093
00:55:00,167 --> 00:55:01,584
So, was the threesome
your first time?

1094
00:55:01,667 --> 00:55:03,584
Or like...
-Whoa, dude, what the fuck?

1095
00:55:03,667 --> 00:55:05,250
Why? Why would you ask that?

1096
00:55:05,333 --> 00:55:07,417
I just heard there was
a religious element.

1097
00:55:07,500 --> 00:55:08,667
Maybe I'm projecting.

1098
00:55:08,750 --> 00:55:10,834
You don't have to
answer him, Jenny, okay?

1099
00:55:10,917 --> 00:55:13,084
It was not my first
time, definitely not.

1100
00:55:13,167 --> 00:55:15,750
Okay, so what was
your first time like?

1101
00:55:15,833 --> 00:55:17,500
Greg, shut the fuck up.

1102
00:55:17,583 --> 00:55:19,000
It's okay, seriously.

1103
00:55:19,083 --> 00:55:20,500
Okay, I'm sorry.

1104
00:55:20,583 --> 00:55:22,584
You can involve her in all
your little twisted hedonistic

1105
00:55:22,667 --> 00:55:26,500
sex games, but I can't ask
her a simple question, Connor?

1106
00:55:26,583 --> 00:55:28,417
Continue, if you may.

1107
00:55:29,583 --> 00:55:33,834
Okay, well it was my senior
year production of "Cats"

1108
00:55:33,917 --> 00:55:36,334
and it was during intermission.

1109
00:55:36,417 --> 00:55:37,917
All right.

1110
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:40,084
-Rum Tum Tugger.
-Okay.

1111
00:55:40,167 --> 00:55:41,917
Fucked me behind
the back curtain.

1112
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:42,917
-Wow, Cat...
-Okay.

1113
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:44,250
-Wow.
-Yeah.

1114
00:55:44,333 --> 00:55:45,250
Amazing.

1115
00:55:45,333 --> 00:55:46,667
And you're fully in character?

1116
00:55:46,750 --> 00:55:48,500
-Oh, full costume.
-Full costume.

1117
00:55:48,583 --> 00:55:50,500
So, you lost it before Connor?

1118
00:55:50,583 --> 00:55:52,167
He was a late bloomer, yeah.

1119
00:55:52,250 --> 00:55:55,000
I mean, 'cause I forgot to
bring condom to prom, okay?

1120
00:55:55,083 --> 00:55:58,000
Yeah, and he never
has unprotected sex.

1121
00:55:58,083 --> 00:56:00,000
It's like, principle.

1122
00:56:00,083 --> 00:56:01,167
How late was the bloom?

1123
00:56:01,250 --> 00:56:04,084
-We don't have to talk...
-22, yeah.

1124
00:56:04,167 --> 00:56:05,417
He was,

1125
00:56:05,500 --> 00:56:08,917
22 years old.

1126
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:11,084
We'll be doing a
physical exam today,

1127
00:56:11,167 --> 00:56:13,584
which will include a
breast and pelvic exam.

1128
00:56:13,667 --> 00:56:15,084
We'll do some blood tests

1129
00:56:15,167 --> 00:56:18,167
and urine studies just
to establish a baseline,

1130
00:56:18,250 --> 00:56:20,584
and we'll do a
vaginal ultrasound

1131
00:56:20,667 --> 00:56:23,500
to try and hear the
baby's heartbeat.

1132
00:56:27,083 --> 00:56:30,000
Greg, what are you doing here?

1133
00:56:31,917 --> 00:56:35,042
Oh boy, this is too good.

1134
00:56:36,458 --> 00:56:37,625
Hey, what are you...

1135
00:56:37,708 --> 00:56:39,167
You decided to bring
her to my doctor?

1136
00:56:39,250 --> 00:56:40,500
I don't own the doctor.

1137
00:56:40,583 --> 00:56:42,042
What do I know about
finding an obstetrician?

1138
00:56:42,125 --> 00:56:43,292
It was this or Yelp.

1139
00:56:43,375 --> 00:56:45,625
So, Yelp, that's how
I found this place.

1140
00:56:45,708 --> 00:56:46,834
What does she not
have her own OB?

1141
00:56:46,917 --> 00:56:48,792
-I do, I...
-So, why are you here?

1142
00:56:48,875 --> 00:56:50,875
I just, I did, I mean, I've,

1143
00:56:50,958 --> 00:56:53,750
I have known her since I was
13 and I was embarrassed.

1144
00:56:53,833 --> 00:56:55,625
This is insane.

1145
00:56:55,708 --> 00:56:57,458
I thought you were...

1146
00:56:59,042 --> 00:57:01,792
Oh, are you like, mad I didn't
get an abortion or something?

1147
00:57:01,875 --> 00:57:03,375
-Oh my God.
-No, I just,

1148
00:57:03,458 --> 00:57:04,542
I thought that you...
-Thought what?

1149
00:57:04,625 --> 00:57:05,542
It's none of your
business, remember?

1150
00:57:05,625 --> 00:57:06,875
Olivia, will you lay off her?

1151
00:57:06,958 --> 00:57:09,292
Connor, I am way too
hormonal for surprises

1152
00:57:09,375 --> 00:57:10,459
right now, okay.

1153
00:57:10,542 --> 00:57:13,709
This is so uncomfortable
and awkward.

1154
00:57:13,792 --> 00:57:15,750
This person wants
to die right now.

1155
00:57:15,833 --> 00:57:16,750
You know what?

1156
00:57:16,833 --> 00:57:18,292
I think maybe you should
just go in with her.

1157
00:57:18,375 --> 00:57:19,709
I don't want him
to go in with me.

1158
00:57:19,792 --> 00:57:22,209
I don't really wanna see
either of you two right now.

1159
00:57:22,292 --> 00:57:23,792
Look, if you let
him go in with you,

1160
00:57:23,875 --> 00:57:25,459
I'll find another doctor, okay?

1161
00:57:25,542 --> 00:57:27,459
Well, why do you care so much?

1162
00:57:27,542 --> 00:57:30,292
Because our kids
are basically twins.

1163
00:57:30,375 --> 00:57:32,000
And the mother of my
kid's twin yells at me

1164
00:57:32,083 --> 00:57:33,125
every time she sees me.

1165
00:57:33,208 --> 00:57:34,959
-I'm not yelling at you!
-And, well, now I'm yelling

1166
00:57:35,042 --> 00:57:37,292
and, you know, you were
like the coolest person

1167
00:57:37,375 --> 00:57:39,125
I'd ever met.

1168
00:57:39,208 --> 00:57:42,209
And I really, I actually
thought you liked me.

1169
00:57:42,292 --> 00:57:44,125
And this is already so hard.

1170
00:57:44,208 --> 00:57:46,792
Can't we just help each other?

1171
00:57:50,292 --> 00:57:52,292
You are like, so nice.

1172
00:57:53,542 --> 00:57:55,458
What's wrong with you?

1173
00:58:02,042 --> 00:58:06,625
I shouldn't have been such a
fucking bitch to you just now.

1174
00:58:06,708 --> 00:58:08,334
That was not fair or nice.

1175
00:58:08,417 --> 00:58:11,292
-That's all right.
-And I'm embarrassed.

1176
00:58:11,375 --> 00:58:15,750
I know, I fucked up your
life pretty bad, so I get it.

1177
00:58:16,958 --> 00:58:18,709
It's not your fault.

1178
00:58:18,792 --> 00:58:19,959
It's nobody's fault.

1179
00:58:20,042 --> 00:58:21,250
No, it's Connor's fault.

1180
00:58:21,333 --> 00:58:23,625
-It's Connor's fault.
-Yeah.

1181
00:58:24,792 --> 00:58:28,500
She really knows how to
get what she wants, huh?

1182
00:58:38,125 --> 00:58:41,625
Hi, I'm sorry, did
you forget something?

1183
00:58:41,708 --> 00:58:43,625
Other than a condom?

1184
00:58:44,625 --> 00:58:46,625
O... kay, yeah.

1185
00:58:49,208 --> 00:58:51,084
Wow. Thank you for buying that.

1186
00:58:51,167 --> 00:58:52,375
Huh? Oh, yeah.

1187
00:58:52,458 --> 00:58:55,375
Did not realize cribs
were so expensive.

1188
00:58:55,458 --> 00:58:58,542
You know, in Finland,
babies sleep in boxes

1189
00:58:58,625 --> 00:59:00,209
that are provided
by the government.

1190
00:59:00,292 --> 00:59:02,792
Oh, well, why didn't you say?

1191
00:59:02,875 --> 00:59:04,459
I could've just bought
you a ticket to Finland

1192
00:59:04,542 --> 00:59:06,209
for the same price.

1193
00:59:06,292 --> 00:59:07,625
Hey, could you you grab that?
-Oh, yeah.

1194
00:59:07,708 --> 00:59:08,875
-Sorry.
-No, you're good.

1195
00:59:08,958 --> 00:59:10,000
Ah.

1196
00:59:11,875 --> 00:59:14,708
I'm fine.

1197
00:59:16,042 --> 00:59:18,875
Oh my God. Whew.

1198
00:59:21,792 --> 00:59:25,334
I just wanted to say, I'm sorry

1199
00:59:25,417 --> 00:59:29,125
that I never called you after
that night we first met.

1200
00:59:29,208 --> 00:59:30,292
Sorry, sorry.

1201
00:59:30,375 --> 00:59:33,209
Oh, no, that's typical
dating, isn't it?

1202
00:59:33,292 --> 00:59:34,959
It's just, I don't
want you to think

1203
00:59:35,042 --> 00:59:36,959
that it wasn't genuine.

1204
00:59:37,042 --> 00:59:39,959
That was a very
genuine threesome.

1205
00:59:40,042 --> 00:59:41,584
I'm trying to be serious.

1206
00:59:41,667 --> 00:59:42,750
Okay.

1207
00:59:42,833 --> 00:59:46,417
And are you just apologizing
or is this going somewhere?

1208
00:59:46,500 --> 00:59:49,042
Whatever else is happening
in my life right now,

1209
00:59:49,125 --> 00:59:52,625
I want you to know
that I'm on your side.

1210
00:59:52,708 --> 00:59:55,542
Well, since you brought it up,

1211
00:59:55,625 --> 00:59:59,667
my parents are pretty
anxious to meet my boyfriend,

1212
00:59:59,750 --> 01:00:00,917
baby daddy.

1213
01:00:02,375 --> 01:00:06,042
Oh, they, they still
think that I'm...

1214
01:00:06,125 --> 01:00:07,750
It would only be this once.

1215
01:00:07,833 --> 01:00:10,333
I am going to tell them soon.

1216
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:13,042
Okay.

1217
01:00:14,042 --> 01:00:15,709
-Yeah?
-Yeah, okay.

1218
01:00:15,792 --> 01:00:16,875
Thank you.

1219
01:00:17,875 --> 01:00:19,209
Also, I know it
was a chaotic time,

1220
01:00:19,292 --> 01:00:22,459
but I really am
sorry for sort of,

1221
01:00:22,542 --> 01:00:25,209
sort of asking you
to get an aborsh.

1222
01:00:25,292 --> 01:00:27,917
Oh, that's, don't
ever call it that.

1223
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:29,625
No, nope.

1224
01:00:29,708 --> 01:00:30,792
And don't let anything
like that slip

1225
01:00:30,875 --> 01:00:31,917
when you're with my parents.

1226
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:34,209
No, I'm a parents'
wet dream, honestly.

1227
01:00:34,292 --> 01:00:35,458
Oh.

1228
01:00:38,458 --> 01:00:41,375
I wanna know the
sex of the baby.

1229
01:00:41,458 --> 01:00:44,125
Didn't you want to be surprised?

1230
01:00:44,208 --> 01:00:46,042
You said you didn't want
any gender specific clothes.

1231
01:00:46,125 --> 01:00:49,750
I think I've had enough
surprises for one pregnancy.

1232
01:00:50,750 --> 01:00:51,833
What is it?

1233
01:00:53,208 --> 01:00:56,625
I'm happy to report you'll
soon be proud parents

1234
01:00:56,708 --> 01:00:59,917
to a beautiful baby girl.

1235
01:01:09,208 --> 01:01:10,458
I knew it.

1236
01:01:11,708 --> 01:01:12,917
That's crazy.

1237
01:01:16,542 --> 01:01:18,292
You didn't seem that excited.

1238
01:01:18,375 --> 01:01:20,584
Of course I'm excited.

1239
01:01:20,667 --> 01:01:22,542
When the doctor
said it was a girl,

1240
01:01:22,625 --> 01:01:25,959
I was really excited,
I wanted to hug you.

1241
01:01:26,042 --> 01:01:28,292
And then I thought, no,
don't, she won't want that.

1242
01:01:28,375 --> 01:01:29,875
It'll ruin the moment for her.

1243
01:01:29,958 --> 01:01:34,125
And realizing that, it kind of
put a damper on things for me.

1244
01:01:34,208 --> 01:01:37,000
That all went through your
head in like, two seconds?

1245
01:01:38,292 --> 01:01:39,417
Yeah.

1246
01:01:40,417 --> 01:01:42,125
I'm sorry, it's dumb.

1247
01:01:42,208 --> 01:01:44,542
And I didn't need to tell you.

1248
01:01:44,625 --> 01:01:46,708
No, I understand.

1249
01:01:50,125 --> 01:01:51,708
Do you, though?

1250
01:01:53,042 --> 01:01:54,375
I think so.

1251
01:01:55,625 --> 01:01:57,333
I'm not sure I do.

1252
01:02:03,708 --> 01:02:05,209
I'm not sure why we're
doing this version

1253
01:02:05,292 --> 01:02:07,292
where I ruin the special moment

1254
01:02:07,375 --> 01:02:09,959
and get all emo in
the parking lot.

1255
01:02:10,042 --> 01:02:11,334
I could, 'cause we could
have it so much better.

1256
01:02:11,417 --> 01:02:12,625
We could.

1257
01:02:12,708 --> 01:02:17,042
When I saw that text
from Kevin Winebar,

1258
01:02:17,125 --> 01:02:21,709
a name which is seared in my
brain by the way, it sucked.

1259
01:02:21,792 --> 01:02:23,000
But I can get past it.

1260
01:02:23,083 --> 01:02:24,209
I know it's not the same.

1261
01:02:24,292 --> 01:02:25,542
I know what we have with Jenny

1262
01:02:25,625 --> 01:02:28,292
is more permanent and
complicated, I know.

1263
01:02:28,375 --> 01:02:30,875
Don't you think if we
try, if we really try,

1264
01:02:30,958 --> 01:02:32,292
we could get past it too?

1265
01:02:32,375 --> 01:02:33,709
No, I...

1266
01:02:33,792 --> 01:02:34,959
Why?

1267
01:02:35,042 --> 01:02:37,084
Because it makes
me feel pathetic.

1268
01:02:37,167 --> 01:02:38,084
Pathetic?

1269
01:02:38,167 --> 01:02:40,125
Yeah, I feel fucking pathetic.

1270
01:02:40,208 --> 01:02:43,125
For you, yeah, it's
not that bad, you know?

1271
01:02:43,208 --> 01:02:45,542
You knocked up two hot babes.

1272
01:02:45,625 --> 01:02:47,375
You know that every
guy that finds that out

1273
01:02:47,458 --> 01:02:48,709
for the rest of your
life is gonna be like,

1274
01:02:48,792 --> 01:02:50,542
"Damn, that Connor,
what a fucking stud."

1275
01:02:50,625 --> 01:02:51,792
And then for me, of
course they're thinking.

1276
01:02:51,875 --> 01:02:53,959
"Shit, her dude
knocked up another girl

1277
01:02:54,042 --> 01:02:56,542
at the exact same time and
she's gonna take him back?

1278
01:02:56,625 --> 01:02:58,625
How weak is that,
how desperate is she?

1279
01:02:58,708 --> 01:02:59,917
How pathetic is she, how..."

1280
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:03,042
No, thank you, you
know? It's just...

1281
01:03:05,875 --> 01:03:07,125
Sure was a lot in there

1282
01:03:07,208 --> 01:03:08,625
about what other people think.

1283
01:03:08,708 --> 01:03:10,208
It's what I think.

1284
01:03:13,125 --> 01:03:16,417
It's not about getting
past something.

1285
01:03:18,458 --> 01:03:19,709
It's about a new reality.

1286
01:03:19,792 --> 01:03:21,792
One that I don't want.

1287
01:03:25,292 --> 01:03:27,375
And I'm sorry, it's dumb.

1288
01:03:27,458 --> 01:03:29,792
And I didn't need to tell you.

1289
01:03:34,542 --> 01:03:39,875
I'm not sure I've ever heard
you say "I'm sorry" before.

1290
01:03:39,958 --> 01:03:42,542
And you never will again.

1291
01:03:43,708 --> 01:03:45,458
I'm glad you're having a girl.

1292
01:03:50,458 --> 01:03:54,458
Maybe Alice is back
in the mix for a name.

1293
01:03:55,958 --> 01:03:58,125
Maybe? Maybe.

1294
01:03:58,208 --> 01:03:59,542
Maybe?

1295
01:03:59,625 --> 01:04:00,500
Maybe.

1296
01:04:00,583 --> 01:04:02,708
Maybe for you and Jenny.

1297
01:04:11,875 --> 01:04:13,125
Is this a weird hug?

1298
01:04:13,208 --> 01:04:16,042
If you have to ask, then
yes, it's a weird hug.

1299
01:04:16,125 --> 01:04:17,292
Thought so.

1300
01:04:18,542 --> 01:04:20,000
I don't hate it.

1301
01:04:21,958 --> 01:04:24,042
Hi, everybody, I'm Greg.

1302
01:04:24,125 --> 01:04:29,208
Olivia and I have been
physical life partners for...

1303
01:04:31,292 --> 01:04:34,209
...sssssix years.

1304
01:04:34,292 --> 01:04:35,875
We're technically
divorced, yeah.

1305
01:04:35,958 --> 01:04:38,792
We don't know the
gender of the child yet,

1306
01:04:38,875 --> 01:04:41,209
but we do know that
gender is a lie.

1307
01:04:41,292 --> 01:04:42,625
Did we talk about
the conception?

1308
01:04:42,708 --> 01:04:43,959
I don't think we talked
about the conception.

1309
01:04:44,042 --> 01:04:46,500
-But we can talk about it.
-We're past that now.

1310
01:04:46,583 --> 01:04:47,709
That pretty much sums it up.

1311
01:04:47,792 --> 01:04:48,875
-The name.
-The name.

1312
01:04:48,958 --> 01:04:51,292
The name is gonna be Elon.

1313
01:04:51,375 --> 01:04:54,542
Thank you, Greg, very creative.

1314
01:04:54,625 --> 01:04:56,709
-Namaste.
-Okay.

1315
01:04:56,792 --> 01:04:58,542
How about you guys?

1316
01:04:58,625 --> 01:05:02,459
Hi, I'm Jenny, this is Connor.

1317
01:05:02,542 --> 01:05:05,209
We're not married either,

1318
01:05:05,292 --> 01:05:09,709
but we haven't even really
been together very long.

1319
01:05:09,792 --> 01:05:12,167
But we're optimistic.

1320
01:05:13,167 --> 01:05:18,209
Yeah, we are together
in our dedication

1321
01:05:18,292 --> 01:05:21,209
in bringing this baby
into the best possible

1322
01:05:21,292 --> 01:05:23,250
situation that we can.

1323
01:05:23,333 --> 01:05:24,792
Thank you for sharing.

1324
01:05:24,875 --> 01:05:28,709
What a lovely sentiment
from a lovely person.

1325
01:05:28,792 --> 01:05:30,875
-Hi.
-Whoa, hi.

1326
01:05:30,958 --> 01:05:32,792
Cool place to stand.

1327
01:05:33,792 --> 01:05:35,292
Dumb question.

1328
01:05:35,375 --> 01:05:39,292
You and Jenny aren't like,
banging or anything, right?

1329
01:05:39,375 --> 01:05:41,542
You're right. That
is a dumb question.

1330
01:05:41,625 --> 01:05:42,834
Why would you think that?

1331
01:05:42,917 --> 01:05:44,542
I don't know, the
fact that you guys

1332
01:05:44,625 --> 01:05:45,875
had already signed
up for this class

1333
01:05:45,958 --> 01:05:49,792
and all the stuff that she
said about you guys in there.

1334
01:05:49,875 --> 01:05:51,375
Are you naming our kid Elon?

1335
01:05:51,458 --> 01:05:54,625
So, there's nothing
happening at all, right?

1336
01:05:54,708 --> 01:05:55,833
No.

1337
01:05:58,458 --> 01:06:01,792
Wait, it's so nice to
finally meet you, Connor.

1338
01:06:01,875 --> 01:06:04,542
If I'm being honest, I'd
been a tad bit worried

1339
01:06:04,625 --> 01:06:07,375
when I heard about
Jenny's situation,

1340
01:06:07,458 --> 01:06:11,209
but I'm just, I'm so
relieved that she has a man

1341
01:06:11,292 --> 01:06:13,209
who can take care of her.

1342
01:06:13,292 --> 01:06:17,042
Well, we're taking
care of each other.

1343
01:06:17,125 --> 01:06:19,292
I guess it's good that
we didn't meet too soon,

1344
01:06:19,375 --> 01:06:23,625
you know, right after the
unexpected news, but...

1345
01:06:24,958 --> 01:06:26,459
Oh, okay, excuse me.

1346
01:06:26,542 --> 01:06:28,959
You know what
would would be fun?

1347
01:06:29,042 --> 01:06:30,625
Do you remember
the little videos

1348
01:06:30,708 --> 01:06:33,292
that you used to make? Connor.
-Oh, no, no.

1349
01:06:33,375 --> 01:06:34,709
We had a little Elizabeth
Taylor over here.

1350
01:06:34,792 --> 01:06:35,959
A star!
-Wait a minute.

1351
01:06:36,042 --> 01:06:37,375
Do you have to bring
this up ever again?

1352
01:06:37,458 --> 01:06:38,792
-Let's get 'em.
-No, she was adorable.

1353
01:06:38,875 --> 01:06:40,084
-Let's get 'em.
-You never never seen

1354
01:06:40,167 --> 01:06:41,125
anything cuter.
-What about it, Connor?

1355
01:06:41,208 --> 01:06:42,292
You wanna see my little
Cookie back then?

1356
01:06:42,375 --> 01:06:44,042
I'm mean, if, if Jenny wants to.

1357
01:06:44,125 --> 01:06:46,125
No, guys, guys, please stop.

1358
01:06:46,208 --> 01:06:47,292
Guys, absolutely not.

1359
01:06:47,375 --> 01:06:50,125
♪ My name is Jenny, Jenny ♪

1360
01:06:50,208 --> 01:06:52,875
Please, can we please
not do this, genuinely?

1361
01:06:52,958 --> 01:06:54,084
Jenny, you're in the way, move.

1362
01:06:54,167 --> 01:06:56,584
This is so embarrassing,
stop. Please, mom.

1363
01:06:56,667 --> 01:06:57,667
She's flying.

1364
01:06:57,750 --> 01:06:59,792
Look, I made those little
wings, can you believe it?

1365
01:06:59,875 --> 01:07:01,042
-They're really nice.
-Adorable.

1366
01:07:01,125 --> 01:07:03,792
She's so cute.
Honey, remember this?

1367
01:07:03,875 --> 01:07:06,042
Okay, she became
obsessed with weddings

1368
01:07:06,125 --> 01:07:07,125
and she wanted to be a bride.

1369
01:07:07,208 --> 01:07:08,209
Remember that?

1370
01:07:08,292 --> 01:07:09,709
She saw our wedding video.
-Yeah.

1371
01:07:09,792 --> 01:07:11,625
-Oh, she was so cute.
-...going to get married!

1372
01:07:11,708 --> 01:07:12,625
It's a miracle!

1373
01:07:12,708 --> 01:07:14,250
I think she was gonna
marry her teddy bear.

1374
01:07:14,333 --> 01:07:16,334
Do you remember when
they married a Ken doll?

1375
01:07:16,417 --> 01:07:17,750
Okay, I'm gonna go
to the bathroom.

1376
01:07:17,833 --> 01:07:20,208
-And Ashley Martin's cat.
-Wow.

1377
01:07:23,208 --> 01:07:24,333
Look at her.

1378
01:07:25,458 --> 01:07:26,792
Oh, such a sweety.

1379
01:07:26,875 --> 01:07:29,292
...would wanna marry
my best friend.

1380
01:07:30,292 --> 01:07:34,125
You know about arranged
marriages and stuff?

1381
01:07:36,292 --> 01:07:39,625
I've been thinking about
people in India, in Japan,

1382
01:07:39,708 --> 01:07:44,875
and they couldn't be any less
happy than people here, right?

1383
01:07:46,625 --> 01:07:48,625
Maybe even more happy.

1384
01:07:50,375 --> 01:07:51,875
And why is that?

1385
01:07:54,292 --> 01:07:57,875
Maybe love is just commitment.

1386
01:08:01,542 --> 01:08:04,625
I don't think
that's all love is.

1387
01:08:31,125 --> 01:08:34,125
Jenny, I'm just
here to support you.

1388
01:08:48,875 --> 01:08:51,084
I think maybe I should go.

1389
01:08:51,167 --> 01:08:53,208
Can you just hold me?

1390
01:09:11,958 --> 01:09:14,875
I don't think I
can do this alone.

1391
01:09:17,167 --> 01:09:18,458
Jenny?

1392
01:09:28,125 --> 01:09:29,292
Jenny?

1393
01:09:40,542 --> 01:09:41,959
Oh, shit.

1394
01:09:42,042 --> 01:09:43,709
I thought you left last night.

1395
01:09:43,792 --> 01:09:45,875
I fell asleep by accident.

1396
01:09:45,958 --> 01:09:47,625
I mean, I didn't
even sleep that much.

1397
01:09:47,708 --> 01:09:49,334
It was very hard.

1398
01:09:49,417 --> 01:09:50,500
The floor.

1399
01:09:50,583 --> 01:09:51,542
Mm-hmm.

1400
01:09:51,625 --> 01:09:54,875
Well, fool me twice,
shame on me, I suppose.

1401
01:09:54,958 --> 01:09:57,083
She is already pregnant.

1402
01:09:58,083 --> 01:09:59,042
Coffee?

1403
01:09:59,125 --> 01:10:00,709
I should really get going.

1404
01:10:00,792 --> 01:10:02,209
You're the first boy
to spend the night

1405
01:10:02,292 --> 01:10:04,209
in that room, Connor, all right?

1406
01:10:04,292 --> 01:10:07,792
Come on and have a
cup of Joe with me.

1407
01:10:16,125 --> 01:10:17,209
Cheers.

1408
01:10:17,292 --> 01:10:18,667
Bad luck to cheers with coffee.

1409
01:10:18,750 --> 01:10:19,833
Yep.

1410
01:10:23,042 --> 01:10:24,709
I think you can understand

1411
01:10:24,792 --> 01:10:28,542
that this situation is
difficult for me, can't you?

1412
01:10:28,625 --> 01:10:30,375
Yes, sir, I do.

1413
01:10:30,458 --> 01:10:35,292
We never imagined things
would go like this for Jenny.

1414
01:10:35,375 --> 01:10:39,125
We always try to impart
a certain set of values

1415
01:10:39,208 --> 01:10:41,042
in this house.

1416
01:10:41,125 --> 01:10:43,459
And that may seem
a little outdated

1417
01:10:43,542 --> 01:10:46,125
to a young person like yourself.

1418
01:10:46,208 --> 01:10:47,334
But let me tell you,

1419
01:10:47,417 --> 01:10:51,958
it can lead to a mighty
uncomplicated life.

1420
01:10:52,958 --> 01:10:55,667
And that's all we
want for Jenny.

1421
01:10:56,667 --> 01:10:58,542
An uncomplicated life.

1422
01:10:59,708 --> 01:11:02,542
And now we're trusting
you to provide it.

1423
01:11:02,625 --> 01:11:03,708
Yes, sir.

1424
01:11:06,792 --> 01:11:09,209
So, you're going to lay
with your chest down

1425
01:11:09,292 --> 01:11:11,292
on the pillow like this.

1426
01:11:11,375 --> 01:11:14,209
And partners, you're going to
put your hands on either side

1427
01:11:14,292 --> 01:11:17,292
of her hips, give her
hips a good jiggle,

1428
01:11:17,375 --> 01:11:22,459
relaxes the pelvis, reset
the nervous system...

1429
01:11:22,542 --> 01:11:25,042
♪ From such a sad, sad song ♪

1430
01:11:27,042 --> 01:11:30,709
♪ I'm leaning on a lamppost ♪

1431
01:11:30,792 --> 01:11:34,375
♪ I'm melting in the sun ♪

1432
01:11:36,625 --> 01:11:39,875
When are you gonna tell your
parents the truth about us?

1433
01:11:40,875 --> 01:11:42,042
Deathbed?

1434
01:11:43,542 --> 01:11:45,459
You know, it's just been
so much better for me

1435
01:11:45,542 --> 01:11:47,292
since they met you.

1436
01:11:47,375 --> 01:11:48,875
It's like, they're
excited about the baby

1437
01:11:48,958 --> 01:11:49,792
and they wanna help.

1438
01:11:49,875 --> 01:11:51,792
And it's made me feel like

1439
01:11:51,875 --> 01:11:55,209
this isn't the worst thing
that's ever happened.

1440
01:11:55,292 --> 01:11:57,625
That doesn't really
answer my question.

1441
01:11:57,708 --> 01:12:00,625
You gotta be fucking kidding me.

1442
01:12:01,625 --> 01:12:02,708
Ugh.

1443
01:12:04,250 --> 01:12:05,333
Hi.

1444
01:12:06,333 --> 01:12:07,209
Oh my God.

1445
01:12:07,292 --> 01:12:08,959
-Oh, fuck.
-What?

1446
01:12:09,042 --> 01:12:10,542
Oh my God.

1447
01:12:10,625 --> 01:12:13,125
Ah, Jesus Christ.
-What's wrong?

1448
01:12:13,208 --> 01:12:14,459
Oh yeah, hemorrhoids.

1449
01:12:14,542 --> 01:12:15,292
You're gonna get those.

1450
01:12:15,375 --> 01:12:17,209
That is just not okay.

1451
01:12:17,292 --> 01:12:20,084
Why is pregnancy so disgusting?

1452
01:12:20,167 --> 01:12:21,834
I've never been this disgusting.

1453
01:12:21,917 --> 01:12:23,334
Women shouldn't have to
be subjected to this.

1454
01:12:23,417 --> 01:12:24,917
Men should have to get pregnant.

1455
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:26,250
They're already gross.

1456
01:12:26,333 --> 01:12:28,084
-Surprise!
-Surprise.

1457
01:12:28,167 --> 01:12:30,417
Wow, thanks, everyone.

1458
01:12:30,500 --> 01:12:33,917
We did not see
this coming at all.

1459
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:36,167
We didn't see that
baby coming either.

1460
01:12:36,250 --> 01:12:37,917
Ha!

1461
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:40,750
It's true. You are
gonna be like a gross,

1462
01:12:40,833 --> 01:12:43,250
disgusting freak probably
for the rest of your life.

1463
01:12:43,333 --> 01:12:44,417
Thank you.

1464
01:12:44,500 --> 01:12:46,667
Yeah, welcome to parenthood.

1465
01:12:46,750 --> 01:12:48,917
But it's gonna be the
most beautiful thing

1466
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:50,959
that ever happened to you.

1467
01:12:51,042 --> 01:12:52,125
When?

1468
01:12:53,917 --> 01:12:55,750
Connor, Jenny tells me
you do some volunteer work

1469
01:12:55,833 --> 01:12:57,167
with the Methodist church.

1470
01:12:57,250 --> 01:12:58,750
-Oh, she did?
-Mm-hmm.

1471
01:12:58,833 --> 01:13:02,667
Yeah. Well, I don't
like to, to brag.

1472
01:13:02,750 --> 01:13:04,084
Which church?

1473
01:13:04,167 --> 01:13:05,750
Peachtree, Central United?

1474
01:13:05,833 --> 01:13:07,334
Yeah, both of those.

1475
01:13:07,417 --> 01:13:08,917
You know what, I would
do 'em all if I could.

1476
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:12,417
I just, I love, I
love the Methodists

1477
01:13:12,500 --> 01:13:13,917
and they're...

1478
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:15,167
-They're Methodist.
-Bingo.

1479
01:13:15,250 --> 01:13:16,334
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

1480
01:13:16,417 --> 01:13:18,167
I heard the pastor at
Peachtree got fired

1481
01:13:18,250 --> 01:13:22,584
for using the collection
funds to fund his liposuction.

1482
01:13:22,667 --> 01:13:23,917
-No.
-Girl.

1483
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:25,417
Yes.

1484
01:13:25,500 --> 01:13:26,667
I don't really,

1485
01:13:26,750 --> 01:13:28,167
I don't know about that.

1486
01:13:28,250 --> 01:13:31,417
You know, I don't like
to spread rumors, so.

1487
01:13:31,500 --> 01:13:33,167
-Right, right.
-Yeah.

1488
01:13:33,250 --> 01:13:36,000
The only gos he
spreads is the gospel.

1489
01:13:36,083 --> 01:13:38,500
Can I get an Amen, saints?

1490
01:13:38,583 --> 01:13:40,250
Do you want my advice?

1491
01:13:40,333 --> 01:13:41,500
Mommy!

1492
01:13:43,167 --> 01:13:44,334
Mommy!

1493
01:13:44,417 --> 01:13:46,334
Enjoy the silence.

1494
01:13:46,417 --> 01:13:47,500
What is it, honey?

1495
01:13:47,583 --> 01:13:49,583
I just wiped Grace's butt!

1496
01:14:04,167 --> 01:14:06,250
Hi, hi, everyone.

1497
01:14:06,333 --> 01:14:07,583
I'm Connor.

1498
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:13,584
Dalai Lama sucks.

1499
01:14:13,667 --> 01:14:16,750
Or a heart that's
afraid to break

1500
01:14:16,833 --> 01:14:19,084
is a heart that's never used.

1501
01:14:19,167 --> 01:14:20,834
Thanks for throwing this for us.

1502
01:14:20,917 --> 01:14:23,333
Definitely never forget it.

1503
01:14:24,417 --> 01:14:25,167
Welcome to the family.

1504
01:14:25,250 --> 01:14:27,834
Oh, thank you, sir.

1505
01:14:27,917 --> 01:14:30,083
Very kind of you to say.

1506
01:14:32,250 --> 01:14:35,084
Well, we will let
you two say goodbye.

1507
01:14:35,167 --> 01:14:36,250
Yeah.

1508
01:14:44,417 --> 01:14:45,667
We have got to tell him.

1509
01:14:45,750 --> 01:14:47,167
I know, I know.

1510
01:14:47,250 --> 01:14:51,125
Just, when the
time's right, okay?

1511
01:14:54,417 --> 01:14:55,750
I'll see you.

1512
01:15:00,583 --> 01:15:05,667
You know, it was a pretty
solid party, like objectively.

1513
01:15:06,667 --> 01:15:09,167
It's got cornbread,
reppressed sexual energy.

1514
01:15:09,250 --> 01:15:12,083
I don't really
need anything else.

1515
01:15:13,833 --> 01:15:18,584
Hey, come on, man, you could
do a lot worse than this.

1516
01:15:18,667 --> 01:15:21,417
Seriously, it's not that bad.

1517
01:15:21,500 --> 01:15:24,167
Matt's mom is a flat-Earther.

1518
01:15:24,250 --> 01:15:26,667
I said I wanted to
travel around the globe,

1519
01:15:26,750 --> 01:15:28,708

Yeah, no problem.

1539
01:17:30,833 --> 01:17:32,334
What kind of high school
senior gets chicken pox?

1540
01:17:32,417 --> 01:17:35,000
Nobody gets chicken
pox, she's a liar.

1541
01:17:35,083 --> 01:17:36,417
She's dead to us.

1542
01:17:36,500 --> 01:17:38,084
Okay, there's leftover
pasta in the fridge.

1543
01:17:38,167 --> 01:17:40,334
He likes it with salt, butter
and salt from the salt shaker.

1544
01:17:40,417 --> 01:17:42,209
But listen, not from
the salt dish, okay?

1545
01:17:42,292 --> 01:17:43,209
Okay, got it, yes.

1546
01:17:43,292 --> 01:17:44,334
I'm gonna text you from the car.

1547
01:17:44,417 --> 01:17:46,334
I will be fine. I'm ready
to get some practice.

1548
01:17:46,417 --> 01:17:47,459
Go, you're already late.

1549
01:17:47,542 --> 01:17:49,584
We love you, Grace.
We love you, Milo.

1550
01:17:49,667 --> 01:17:52,292
-Bye.
-Be nice to Aunt Livvy.

1551
01:17:57,083 --> 01:17:58,417
Three eights.

1552
01:17:58,500 --> 01:18:00,000
Uh oh, careful.

1553
01:18:00,083 --> 01:18:01,833
I have to do two.

1554
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:05,250
Thanks for not having
anything better to do.

1555
01:18:05,333 --> 01:18:08,083
We make a good team, remember?

1556
01:18:09,542 --> 01:18:10,459
Here you go.

1557
01:18:10,542 --> 01:18:11,667
I don't have blues or eights.

1558
01:18:11,750 --> 01:18:14,250
-Here, pumpkin.
-You don't have any blues?

1559
01:18:14,333 --> 01:18:16,458
Oh, you shouldn't
have told me that.

1560
01:18:22,750 --> 01:18:25,584
I'm gonna put down yellow five.

1561
01:18:25,667 --> 01:18:26,917
My turn.

1562
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:30,459
So, did I put down
a six or did you?

1563
01:18:30,542 --> 01:18:32,250
-I did.
-So, it's my turn?

1564
01:18:32,333 --> 01:18:34,667
So I can put down a red six?

1565
01:18:34,750 --> 01:18:37,084
-I know that, face up.
-Face up.

1566
01:18:37,167 --> 01:18:38,084
Like that?

1567
01:18:38,167 --> 01:18:40,459
What about if I play...

1568
01:18:40,542 --> 01:18:41,500
Yeah, that's fine.

1569
01:18:41,583 --> 01:18:44,000
Oh, you didn't see
that coming, did you?

1570
01:18:44,083 --> 01:18:46,000
Kids, it's time for bed.

1571
01:18:53,583 --> 01:18:57,084
Looks like you were a huge
hit at that baby shower.

1572
01:18:57,167 --> 01:18:58,250
Oh.

1573
01:18:59,250 --> 01:19:01,334
I wouldn't say a hit.

1574
01:19:01,417 --> 01:19:02,750
I straight up asked
you if you and Jenny

1575
01:19:02,833 --> 01:19:03,917
were together.
-We're not together.

1576
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:05,167
-And you said that you...
-I promise.

1577
01:19:05,250 --> 01:19:06,167
Then what was that?

1578
01:19:06,250 --> 01:19:07,792
I said I was with
her, I wanted to help

1579
01:19:07,875 --> 01:19:09,750
and it got outta hand and
she's not helping me out.

1580
01:19:09,833 --> 01:19:11,584
What?

1581
01:19:11,667 --> 01:19:13,417
I was afraid you'd be mad.

1582
01:19:13,500 --> 01:19:15,250
Well, at least you get me.

1583
01:19:16,250 --> 01:19:17,292
Hey.

1584
01:19:18,667 --> 01:19:19,834
She's just waiting
for the right time

1585
01:19:19,917 --> 01:19:20,917
to tell them we broke up.

1586
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:22,625
-You honestly believe that?
-Yeah.

1587
01:19:22,708 --> 01:19:24,584
-Really?
-Yeah.

1588
01:19:24,667 --> 01:19:26,334
Okay, well, you've clearly
never had an affair

1589
01:19:26,417 --> 01:19:28,000
with a married person before.

1590
01:19:28,083 --> 01:19:30,917
The longer you do this, the
easier it is for you guys

1591
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:32,167
to just end up together.

1592
01:19:32,250 --> 01:19:34,167
-It's not what she wants.
-Why wouldn't she want that?

1593
01:19:34,250 --> 01:19:36,042
-You tell me!
-What do you mean?

1594
01:19:36,125 --> 01:19:37,250
You're in the exact
same position as her,

1595
01:19:37,333 --> 01:19:38,334
you can't ever stop
telling me how much...

1596
01:19:38,417 --> 01:19:39,667
-Okay, we should be quiet.
-You don't wanna

1597
01:19:39,750 --> 01:19:42,000
get back together.
-The kids are sleeping!

1598
01:19:52,833 --> 01:19:55,250
Here's the thing, though.

1599
01:19:57,583 --> 01:20:01,000
You can't tell me
what to do with Jenny.

1600
01:20:02,083 --> 01:20:05,750
And not because I'm not
making obvious mistakes

1601
01:20:05,833 --> 01:20:09,167
and enabling her
and leading her on.

1602
01:20:09,250 --> 01:20:10,500
I don't know, I hope not.

1603
01:20:10,583 --> 01:20:14,125
But, but because that's
not your role anymore.

1604
01:20:15,583 --> 01:20:17,917
You didn't want it to be.

1605
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:20,042
That's not what, I...

1606
01:20:20,125 --> 01:20:23,667
I think about us getting
back together all the time.

1607
01:20:24,750 --> 01:20:27,250
I wish it was as easy
as you say it is.

1608
01:20:27,333 --> 01:20:28,834
I just, it's hard.

1609
01:20:28,917 --> 01:20:33,334
I know that I'm the one making
it harder in a lot of ways.

1610
01:20:33,417 --> 01:20:36,750
And it's not because
I don't care, I...

1611
01:20:43,667 --> 01:20:46,292
-Oh.
-Maya, Roger, hi.

1612
01:20:46,375 --> 01:20:48,584
Hi, how was night?

1613
01:20:48,667 --> 01:20:50,334
Connor, hi.

1614
01:20:50,417 --> 01:20:51,792
Thank you, Connor,
for your help.

1615
01:20:51,875 --> 01:20:53,334
-Mm-hmm, yeah.
-And your assistance.

1616
01:20:53,417 --> 01:20:55,000
-Of course.
-Yeah.

1617
01:20:56,750 --> 01:20:57,917
Okay, bye.

1618
01:20:58,917 --> 01:21:01,000
Bye, guys. Sorry.

1619
01:21:01,083 --> 01:21:02,750
He was helping me.

1620
01:21:02,833 --> 01:21:05,625
Were they K-I-S-S-I-N-G?

1621
01:21:19,167 --> 01:21:20,250
I mean, you got it, right?

1622
01:21:20,333 --> 01:21:23,792
You got what I was
trying to say...

1623
01:21:26,333 --> 01:21:27,375
Right?

1624
01:21:30,583 --> 01:21:32,250
Think you got it?

1625
01:21:38,750 --> 01:21:39,834
Oh, hello...

1626
01:21:39,917 --> 01:21:41,500
What the fuck is that?

1627
01:21:41,583 --> 01:21:42,917
What the fuck, you?

1628
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:45,000
Why are you still pregnant?

1629
01:21:45,083 --> 01:21:47,500
Hmm, changed my mind.

1630
01:21:47,583 --> 01:21:48,834
What's your vibe?

1631
01:21:48,917 --> 01:21:50,209
Fucking relax, dude,
what do you care?

1632
01:21:50,292 --> 01:21:52,000
You said you were going
to get it taken care of.

1633
01:21:52,083 --> 01:21:55,750
I texted you to see how it
went, and you said, "Fine."

1634
01:21:55,833 --> 01:21:58,334
Yeah, it did go fine.

1635
01:21:58,417 --> 01:22:00,167
I wanted to keep it.

1636
01:22:03,208 --> 01:22:04,250
What?

1637
01:22:06,792 --> 01:22:09,167
-Um...
-What?

1638
01:22:09,250 --> 01:22:11,667
I never got a vasectomy.

1639
01:22:11,750 --> 01:22:15,334
I never got one. Never had it.

1640
01:22:15,417 --> 01:22:20,334
You told me that
you had a vasectomy.

1641
01:22:20,417 --> 01:22:22,084
I did, I know I did,

1642
01:22:22,167 --> 01:22:23,834
and I lied about that
because, I don't know,

1643
01:22:23,917 --> 01:22:26,084
I thought that like, it
would make it seem to you

1644
01:22:26,167 --> 01:22:29,750
like it was less
serious with my wife.

1645
01:22:29,833 --> 01:22:30,917
So I...

1646
01:22:31,000 --> 01:22:34,417
"Less serious with your wife?"

1647
01:22:34,500 --> 01:22:36,417
You said you were on the pill.

1648
01:22:36,500 --> 01:22:37,834
-Mm-hmm.
-You said that.

1649
01:22:37,917 --> 01:22:38,834
I'm gonna fucking kill you.

1650
01:22:38,917 --> 01:22:41,000
You fucking asshole!
-Hey, don't hit me, please.

1651
01:22:41,083 --> 01:22:41,917
Less serious with your wife?!

1652
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:43,334
Chill, stop, stop.

1653
01:22:43,417 --> 01:22:49,000
Calm down, calm down, okay?

1654
01:22:49,083 --> 01:22:55,834
That's not good for the baby.

1655
01:22:55,917 --> 01:23:00,500
You okay?

1656
01:23:00,583 --> 01:23:03,084
Whose did you think it was?

1657
01:23:03,167 --> 01:23:05,083
It might not be mine, right?

1658
01:23:06,833 --> 01:23:08,250
You piece of shit!

1659
01:23:08,333 --> 01:23:10,584
Oh my God, I just Googled
prenatal paternity testing.

1660
01:23:10,667 --> 01:23:13,750
My life is officially
hot fucking garbage.

1661
01:23:15,833 --> 01:23:17,167
Are you crying?

1662
01:23:17,250 --> 01:23:19,417
Please don't tell my
wife, okay, please?

1663
01:23:19,500 --> 01:23:21,334
It's not possible for me
to wanna talk to your wife

1664
01:23:21,417 --> 01:23:24,167
any less than I already do.

1665
01:23:24,250 --> 01:23:27,917
Okay, here's one, 99% accurate
results in under a week.

1666
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:30,500
Great, good, thank you,
I will take care of it.

1667
01:23:30,583 --> 01:23:31,584
All right, it's $1,600.

1668
01:23:31,667 --> 01:23:33,667
-1,600?
-Kevin!

1669
01:23:33,750 --> 01:23:37,084
That's fine, it's
fine, I got it.

1670
01:23:37,167 --> 01:23:40,000
And they say chivalry is dead.

1671
01:23:42,083 --> 01:23:44,167
I got too many kids already.

1672
01:23:44,250 --> 01:23:45,333
Kevin.

1673
01:23:46,750 --> 01:23:50,167
Can't believe it's almost time.

1674
01:23:50,250 --> 01:23:53,334
A kid is so permanent, you know?

1675
01:23:53,417 --> 01:23:56,750
We'll never not have
a kid ever again.

1676
01:24:02,250 --> 01:24:07,083
Hey, do you wanna talk
about the other night?

1677
01:24:12,250 --> 01:24:14,167
Do you ever consider
that I may not be

1678
01:24:14,250 --> 01:24:15,833
what's best for you?

1679
01:24:18,167 --> 01:24:20,084
That I just keep hurting you?

1680
01:24:20,167 --> 01:24:23,667
Whoa, where's this coming from?

1681
01:24:25,000 --> 01:24:28,667
I'm brash, I'm selfish.

1682
01:24:29,667 --> 01:24:31,875
I'm always in a bad mood.

1683
01:24:33,917 --> 01:24:35,917
I'm a lifetime fuck-up

1684
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:39,625
trying to convince the
world that I'm not.

1685
01:24:40,917 --> 01:24:43,083
Why would you want that?

1686
01:24:53,083 --> 01:24:56,458
You are so smart,

1687
01:24:59,667 --> 01:25:03,417
and funny, and beautiful,

1688
01:25:05,583 --> 01:25:07,917
and undoubtedly gonna own
your own restaurant one day,

1689
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:11,084
because if there's
one thing I know,

1690
01:25:11,167 --> 01:25:14,834
you always find a
way to be the boss.

1691
01:25:14,917 --> 01:25:16,167
I am bossy.

1692
01:25:23,125 --> 01:25:28,625
Olivia, all my life,
I've felt like I was...

1693
01:25:28,708 --> 01:25:31,333
What? You okay?
-Ahh.

1694
01:25:33,417 --> 01:25:35,250
Oh, shit!

1695
01:25:37,500 --> 01:25:40,667
Okay, where do you
fall on this scale?

1696
01:25:40,750 --> 01:25:44,250
-Hmm, you know, I'm...
-Hmm?

1697
01:25:45,500 --> 01:25:47,834
I wouldn't say
it's a full smile.

1698
01:25:47,917 --> 01:25:49,084
Okay, when they ask though, say,

1699
01:25:49,167 --> 01:25:52,209
because the epidural
will be ready faster.

1700
01:25:52,292 --> 01:25:53,500
Like that?

1701
01:25:53,583 --> 01:25:55,334
No, like, yeah, that's good.

1702
01:25:55,417 --> 01:25:56,750
Like, mm.

1703
01:25:56,833 --> 01:26:03,000
I gotta have da epidural.

1704
01:26:03,083 --> 01:26:04,584
Can I just tell them
that I'm in pain?

1705
01:26:04,667 --> 01:26:06,334
Yes, but also make the face.

1706
01:26:06,417 --> 01:26:08,167
Should I just put a
question mark here or?

1707
01:26:08,250 --> 01:26:10,000
It's not funny, dude.

1708
01:26:10,083 --> 01:26:11,375
Did you tell him?

1709
01:26:11,458 --> 01:26:14,333
No, and I'm hoping that
there's nothing to tell.

1710
01:26:16,417 --> 01:26:18,750
Keep your fingers crossed.

1711
01:26:25,167 --> 01:26:27,167
She's still only
four centimeters.

1712
01:26:27,250 --> 01:26:29,167
-Can I go in?
-Sure.

1713
01:26:29,250 --> 01:26:31,167
-Hey.
-Hey.

1714
01:26:31,250 --> 01:26:36,333
Not to brag, but that nurse
and I just got to third base.

1715
01:26:37,333 --> 01:26:41,750
She's zero centimeters
dilated if you were curious.

1716
01:26:45,750 --> 01:26:48,250
Do you remember
how we first met?

1717
01:26:48,333 --> 01:26:50,250
-When you got hired...
-No, no, no,

1718
01:26:50,333 --> 01:26:51,667
just before that.

1719
01:26:51,750 --> 01:26:54,834
Your old manager had that
party and Greg brought me,

1720
01:26:54,917 --> 01:26:58,084
and you and I were waiting
in line for the bathroom,

1721
01:26:58,167 --> 01:26:59,584
making small talk.

1722
01:26:59,667 --> 01:27:01,917
And then the frat bro came
over, started hitting on you.

1723
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:03,334
Yeah, as frat guys do.

1724
01:27:03,417 --> 01:27:05,584
Yeah, yeah, and he asked
who you knew at the party,

1725
01:27:05,667 --> 01:27:09,167
and you pointed at me and said
we were childhood friends.

1726
01:27:09,250 --> 01:27:12,167
And he looked kind
of suspicious.

1727
01:27:12,250 --> 01:27:13,667
So, I said, okay,
well, on three,

1728
01:27:13,750 --> 01:27:15,834
let's say the person our
high school is named after.

1729
01:27:15,917 --> 01:27:18,500
And I counted down and
said, "Thomas Jefferson."

1730
01:27:18,583 --> 01:27:20,000
And you counted down
and said, said...

1731
01:27:20,083 --> 01:27:22,084
"Saddam Hussein."

1732
01:27:22,167 --> 01:27:24,584
Which made me laugh so much.

1733
01:27:24,667 --> 01:27:27,334
And you just kept doing more
and more ridiculous answers

1734
01:27:27,417 --> 01:27:30,667
about our favorite
teacher, and our first pet,

1735
01:27:30,750 --> 01:27:31,917
and I can't remember,

1736
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:33,417
but it was honestly
the most charming thing

1737
01:27:33,500 --> 01:27:35,084
I've ever seen in my life.

1738
01:27:35,167 --> 01:27:36,250
Wow.

1739
01:27:38,333 --> 01:27:40,584
I tried to introduce
you to Greg that night.

1740
01:27:40,667 --> 01:27:41,834
Yes.

1741
01:27:41,917 --> 01:27:43,334
Yes, because you didn't
know he brought me

1742
01:27:43,417 --> 01:27:46,084
and you thought we'd vibe,
which, you know, props to you.

1743
01:27:46,167 --> 01:27:47,250
Very astute.

1744
01:27:47,333 --> 01:27:49,334
I may have thought you were gay.

1745
01:27:49,417 --> 01:27:50,500
Huh.

1746
01:27:50,583 --> 01:27:52,250
Still on the fence.

1747
01:27:52,333 --> 01:27:55,000
I take that as a compliment.

1748
01:28:16,542 --> 01:28:20,625
One day, I wanna
tell our daughter

1749
01:28:20,708 --> 01:28:22,542
the story of how we met.

1750
01:28:27,083 --> 01:28:28,708
I hope you do.

1751
01:28:32,458 --> 01:28:33,959
I could have swore
that these things

1752
01:28:34,042 --> 01:28:35,209
are like, 40 minutes, tops.

1753
01:28:35,292 --> 01:28:36,875
Oh, I'm sorry, are you bored?

1754
01:28:36,958 --> 01:28:38,667
Because I've literally never
been more uncomfortable

1755
01:28:38,750 --> 01:28:39,875
in my entire life.

1756
01:28:39,958 --> 01:28:42,375
Okay, but this is
the longest recorded

1757
01:28:42,458 --> 01:28:43,709
delivery in human
history, right?

1758
01:28:43,792 --> 01:28:45,292
She just got here yesterday.

1759
01:28:45,375 --> 01:28:46,875
Okay, so...

1760
01:28:46,958 --> 01:28:48,958
-No.
-No, obviously.

1761
01:28:49,958 --> 01:28:51,458
I'm just checking.

1762
01:29:00,375 --> 01:29:01,458
Hi, there.

1763
01:29:02,292 --> 01:29:03,459
It's happening.

1764
01:29:03,542 --> 01:29:05,375
I just got admitted.

1765
01:29:07,292 --> 01:29:08,459
What?

1766
01:29:08,542 --> 01:29:09,708
You're here?

1767
01:29:10,708 --> 01:29:13,417
Now? I mean, there?

1768
01:29:13,500 --> 01:29:15,542
Yeah, sorry, I would've
called you earlier,

1769
01:29:15,625 --> 01:29:18,334
but my water hadn't broken
yet and I thought it was,

1770
01:29:18,417 --> 01:29:19,542
you know, a false alarm.

1771
01:29:19,625 --> 01:29:21,125
No, no, of course.

1772
01:29:21,208 --> 01:29:25,709
Where exactly are
you in the hospital?

1773
01:29:25,792 --> 01:29:27,459
Labor and delivery.

1774
01:29:27,542 --> 01:29:29,792
I'm not giving birth in
the cafeteria, Connor.

1775
01:29:29,875 --> 01:29:31,292
Thanks, Ma.
-I'm sorry.

1776
01:29:31,375 --> 01:29:32,542
But if you're confused,

1777
01:29:32,625 --> 01:29:35,625
I'm sure someone could
show you where...

1778
01:29:36,625 --> 01:29:40,334
-Okay.
-Why are you here already?

1779
01:29:40,417 --> 01:29:43,209
Do you know if I could get
a good kombucha around here?

1780
01:29:43,292 --> 01:29:45,042
Greg?

1781
01:29:45,125 --> 01:29:46,375
Hi, what's up?

1782
01:29:46,458 --> 01:29:47,625
-Hi.
-Hey.

1783
01:29:47,708 --> 01:29:48,792
I think we should
probably get going

1784
01:29:48,875 --> 01:29:50,209
to my room now, dad, right?

1785
01:29:50,292 --> 01:29:52,959
Yeah, let's go get settled.

1786
01:29:53,042 --> 01:29:54,375
Shall we?
-Dad, dad, dad, just.

1787
01:29:54,458 --> 01:29:55,959
-Paul, Paul?
-Leave these people alone.

1788
01:29:56,042 --> 01:29:58,042
Dad? Dad!

1789
01:29:58,125 --> 01:29:59,709
-Paul, Paul.
-No, no.

1790
01:29:59,792 --> 01:30:02,625
-Can we help you?
-So, this is Olivia.

1791
01:30:02,708 --> 01:30:05,459
Hey, my life partner, my
physical life partner.

1792
01:30:05,542 --> 01:30:07,792
Jenny said you were homosexual.

1793
01:30:07,875 --> 01:30:10,792
Which we completely support.

1794
01:30:10,875 --> 01:30:14,209
I was drunk. We were drunk.

1795
01:30:14,292 --> 01:30:16,375
This is 2024, you know?

1796
01:30:18,542 --> 01:30:19,958
What is this?

1797
01:30:24,958 --> 01:30:26,292
I'm so sorry.

1798
01:30:29,875 --> 01:30:30,709
Dad!

1799
01:30:30,792 --> 01:30:31,958
Dad, stop!

1800
01:30:34,042 --> 01:30:35,667
No, no, no, stay.

1801
01:30:38,458 --> 01:30:40,125
-Dad!
-Hey, easy.

1802
01:30:40,208 --> 01:30:41,459
-I'm sure it's fine.
-Dad, let go.

1803
01:30:41,542 --> 01:30:43,333
You son of a bitch!

1804
01:30:45,375 --> 01:30:47,625
-Hey, what is going on?
-You keep your hands

1805
01:30:47,708 --> 01:30:50,375
off of him, you motherfucker!

1806
01:30:50,458 --> 01:30:53,375
She's having Connor's baby too.

1807
01:30:55,042 --> 01:30:56,792
-No.
-All right, don't worry.

1808
01:30:56,875 --> 01:30:57,959
No, no, no.

1809
01:30:58,042 --> 01:31:00,458
That can't be. That can't be.

1810
01:31:07,125 --> 01:31:08,292
Is this true?

1811
01:31:13,375 --> 01:31:14,458
Oh.

1812
01:31:19,042 --> 01:31:20,125
Look out.

1813
01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:33,292
I'm sorry.

1814
01:32:34,458 --> 01:32:35,542
Hello?

1815
01:32:37,292 --> 01:32:39,209
Yeah, this is her.

1816
01:32:39,292 --> 01:32:41,542
Sure, March 15th, 1993.

1817
01:32:42,792 --> 01:32:45,292
Yeah, it's 5422.

1818
01:32:46,875 --> 01:32:48,875
Okay, yeah, I can wait.

1819
01:33:10,125 --> 01:33:11,417
I should go.

1820
01:33:13,042 --> 01:33:15,625
Oh, you don't have to leave.

1821
01:33:26,583 --> 01:33:27,917
Look, um...

1822
01:33:32,167 --> 01:33:35,458
I am so sorry for that.

1823
01:33:37,458 --> 01:33:40,042
I told her she had
to tell her parents

1824
01:33:40,125 --> 01:33:43,125
and she said...
-She's not your baby.

1825
01:33:47,292 --> 01:33:48,375
What?

1826
01:33:49,375 --> 01:33:51,792
She's not yours.

1827
01:33:57,708 --> 01:33:59,958
Why are you saying that?

1828
01:34:02,292 --> 01:34:04,959
Because it's true.

1829
01:34:05,042 --> 01:34:07,292
I just found out, I swear.

1830
01:34:10,333 --> 01:34:12,125
I couldn't let you...

1831
01:34:14,458 --> 01:34:15,625
I'm so sorry.

1832
01:34:16,625 --> 01:34:18,375
I don't understand.

1833
01:34:21,000 --> 01:34:22,458
Who...

1834
01:34:38,708 --> 01:34:41,375
I so wanted her to be yours.

1835
01:34:43,625 --> 01:34:46,542
I swear.

1836
01:36:17,708 --> 01:36:20,375
Paul. Paul.

1837
01:36:20,458 --> 01:36:23,375
I think you're in
the wrong room.

1838
01:36:24,375 --> 01:36:26,583
I'm here for the
birth of my daughter.

1839
01:36:30,625 --> 01:36:33,375
I'm not gonna let her down too.

1840
01:36:41,208 --> 01:36:42,292
Dad.

1841
01:36:55,958 --> 01:36:57,375
Okay, here we go.

1842
01:36:57,458 --> 01:36:59,375
Take a deep breath.

1843
01:36:59,458 --> 01:37:04,709
One, two, three, four, five.

1844
01:37:04,792 --> 01:37:09,042
-You're strong, you got it.
-Six, seven, eight, nine,

1845
01:37:09,125 --> 01:37:12,792
ten.

1846
01:37:12,875 --> 01:37:15,125
-Another deep breath.
-It's fine.

1847
01:37:15,208 --> 01:37:19,750
You're doing so well.
-One, two, three, four, five,

1848
01:37:19,833 --> 01:37:21,042
six.
-Yes.

1849
01:37:21,125 --> 01:37:22,625
Good job, good job.

1850
01:37:22,708 --> 01:37:24,167
You're doing so well.
-You're doing so good.

1851
01:37:24,250 --> 01:37:26,167
Good job, good job.

1852
01:37:28,292 --> 01:37:29,334
Okay.

1853
01:37:29,417 --> 01:37:31,792
Just one more big push, one.

1854
01:37:31,875 --> 01:37:35,709
-Two, three, four, five.
-Okay, she's coming.

1855
01:37:35,792 --> 01:37:38,667
That's it, you got it.

1856
01:37:41,542 --> 01:37:49,542
-Oh, my God.
-You did it, you did it.

1857
01:37:53,333 --> 01:37:54,542
You did it!

1858
01:37:57,792 --> 01:37:59,042
You did it.

1859
01:38:31,792 --> 01:38:35,792
-Connor, I did some things...
-You don't need to do this.

1860
01:38:36,792 --> 01:38:37,875
Do what?

1861
01:38:39,625 --> 01:38:41,875
Like, you don't need to explain,

1862
01:38:41,958 --> 01:38:45,542
or make excuses, or apologize.

1863
01:38:48,125 --> 01:38:50,209
I've just spent
the last few hours

1864
01:38:50,292 --> 01:38:53,042
on the world's most fucked-up
roller coaster of emotions

1865
01:38:53,125 --> 01:38:56,042
and I can't deal
with another dip.

1866
01:38:59,708 --> 01:39:01,209
I did something that hurt you

1867
01:39:01,292 --> 01:39:06,542
and I would do anything in the
entire world to take it back.

1868
01:39:06,625 --> 01:39:07,708
Anything.

1869
01:39:10,208 --> 01:39:15,209
I don't expect that you'll
forgive me or get past it,

1870
01:39:15,292 --> 01:39:19,709
but I just wanted to tell
you that I love you so much

1871
01:39:19,792 --> 01:39:22,125
and I wish I said it
more often, but I...

1872
01:39:22,208 --> 01:39:24,625
It's not about getting past it.

1873
01:39:26,625 --> 01:39:30,208
It's about a new
reality, remember?

1874
01:39:33,292 --> 01:39:36,209
I didn't understand that then.

1875
01:39:36,292 --> 01:39:37,625
But I do now.

1876
01:39:48,625 --> 01:39:49,708
Connor?

1877
01:40:04,250 --> 01:40:05,333
Hi.

1878
01:40:06,500 --> 01:40:08,625
Your baby wasn't his?

1879
01:40:09,750 --> 01:40:10,833
No.

1880
01:40:13,792 --> 01:40:14,958
I'm sorry.

1881
01:40:17,000 --> 01:40:18,208
Me too.

1882
01:40:23,583 --> 01:40:24,708
Ugh.

1883
01:40:26,375 --> 01:40:30,083
Hey, remember that
time we had sex?

1884
01:40:34,208 --> 01:40:37,333
Yeah, pops up every
once in a while.

1885
01:40:40,375 --> 01:40:43,625
Well, you know, maybe,

1886
01:40:44,625 --> 01:40:47,042
maybe we aren't so strange.

1887
01:40:48,458 --> 01:40:52,042
We're just two pairs of people
accidentally having kids.

1888
01:40:52,125 --> 01:40:55,208
I wouldn't say I'm
part of a pair.

1889
01:40:56,542 --> 01:40:58,208
Yeah, me neither.

1890
01:40:59,875 --> 01:41:01,709
He's gonna come through, though.

1891
01:41:01,792 --> 01:41:04,792
And you're gonna
be an amazing mom.

1892
01:41:06,542 --> 01:41:08,375
I just don't know
how many amazing moms

1893
01:41:08,458 --> 01:41:11,000
start out not ready to be one.

1894
01:41:12,250 --> 01:41:14,042
Probably a lot.

1895
01:41:21,042 --> 01:41:25,208
You know, we can help
each other out too, right?

1896
01:41:26,375 --> 01:41:28,917
Don't you need a mom friend?

1897
01:41:30,792 --> 01:41:32,625
We can read Mommy Reddit.

1898
01:41:32,708 --> 01:41:34,709
Talk about their sore nipples.

1899
01:41:34,792 --> 01:41:36,459
Oh my God, forget my nipples.

1900
01:41:36,542 --> 01:41:38,709
I think my vagina tore
straight to my asshole.

1901
01:41:38,792 --> 01:41:40,709
Oh, God, second degree?

1902
01:41:40,792 --> 01:41:43,250
Yes, it's just one hole.

1903
01:41:49,292 --> 01:41:53,042
Wow, she's so beautiful.

1904
01:42:04,125 --> 01:42:07,042
Okay, that is a
bachelorette pad.

1905
01:42:09,708 --> 01:42:11,125
It's perfect for you.

1906
01:42:11,208 --> 01:42:14,125
-It is, it's perfect for us.
-Do you need help moving?

1907
01:42:14,208 --> 01:42:16,959
Oh, no, no, taking Fiona's
already the best thing

1908
01:42:17,042 --> 01:42:18,209
you could do.

1909
01:42:18,292 --> 01:42:19,792
Also, if you need a real man,

1910
01:42:19,875 --> 01:42:22,792
I know that Connor isn't
fit for the job, I'm here.

1911
01:42:22,875 --> 01:42:24,625
You've probably seen my delts.

1912
01:42:24,708 --> 01:42:26,959
I did notice that,
I would love that.

1913
01:42:27,042 --> 01:42:28,125
Thank you, Greg.

1914
01:42:28,208 --> 01:42:29,542
I kind of just wanted
the compliment.

1915
01:42:29,625 --> 01:42:31,292
I didn't actually wanna
help, if I'm being honest.

1916
01:42:31,375 --> 01:42:33,209
These are not moving muscles.

1917
01:42:33,292 --> 01:42:34,709
These are gay muscles,
they're for show.

1918
01:42:34,792 --> 01:42:36,209
-Come on.
-Come on, Greg.

1919
01:42:36,292 --> 01:42:38,708
I will help you
get a task rabbit.

1920
01:42:52,792 --> 01:42:53,958
Surprise.

1921
01:42:56,125 --> 01:42:58,042
What are you doing here?

1922
01:42:58,125 --> 01:42:59,459
I bumped into Jenny and Greg

1923
01:42:59,542 --> 01:43:03,209
and they said the little
sprout's with you,

1924
01:43:03,292 --> 01:43:05,875
thought they could
have a play date.

1925
01:43:05,958 --> 01:43:08,625
I don't know how much
playing can be done,

1926
01:43:08,708 --> 01:43:13,042
but I guess they could
fidget near each other.

1927
01:43:13,125 --> 01:43:16,042
Isn't that what you and Greg do?

1928
01:43:16,125 --> 01:43:17,375
Come in.

1929
01:43:17,458 --> 01:43:19,375
Wow, she is so cute.

1930
01:43:22,458 --> 01:43:24,042
How are you,

1931
01:43:24,125 --> 01:43:26,292
how's co-parenting life?

1932
01:43:26,375 --> 01:43:28,709
Honestly, pretty good.

1933
01:43:28,792 --> 01:43:33,042
Half the time, it's just
my same normal life.

1934
01:43:33,125 --> 01:43:34,375
The other half,
I get to hang out

1935
01:43:34,458 --> 01:43:36,709
with this little nugget, so.

1936
01:43:36,792 --> 01:43:37,875
Hmm.

1937
01:43:40,375 --> 01:43:45,500
Not, not to say that
it's easy, obviously.

1938
01:43:46,500 --> 01:43:48,042
How's it going for you?

1939
01:43:48,125 --> 01:43:51,417
I'm hanging in there.

1940
01:43:51,500 --> 01:43:52,667
Yeah.

1941
01:43:54,042 --> 01:43:55,959
What'd you name her?

1942
01:43:56,042 --> 01:43:57,125
Fiona.

1943
01:43:57,208 --> 01:43:58,334
-Nice.
-Yeah.

1944
01:43:58,417 --> 01:43:59,917
-Pretty.
-It was Jenny's idea.

1945
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:01,167
She's attached to it

1946
01:44:01,250 --> 01:44:03,250
and I had limited
political capital.

1947
01:44:03,333 --> 01:44:05,625
So, what'd you name yours?

1948
01:44:07,208 --> 01:44:08,333
Alice.

1949
01:44:17,083 --> 01:44:20,834
Thought that made you
think of cans-of-tuna girl.

1950
01:44:20,917 --> 01:44:23,750
Makes me think of
something different now.

1951
01:44:27,167 --> 01:44:29,334
I've been calling you,
obviously, you know,

1952
01:44:29,417 --> 01:44:34,292
and I've been calling you and
I wanted to give you space.

1953
01:44:34,375 --> 01:44:35,500
I know.

1954
01:44:36,833 --> 01:44:39,084
It's all out there, you know,

1955
01:44:39,167 --> 01:44:42,167
no more secrets,
no more surprises.

1956
01:44:44,167 --> 01:44:47,000
No one else standing in our way.

1957
01:44:48,083 --> 01:44:51,083
Just us needing
to move past this.

1958
01:44:54,000 --> 01:44:57,833
Just you, not to point fingers,

1959
01:44:59,000 --> 01:45:00,458
but I'm ready.

1960
01:45:01,458 --> 01:45:02,625
What?

1961
01:45:03,583 --> 01:45:05,667
I don't know if I am.

1962
01:45:08,000 --> 01:45:11,292
I'm just scared to
get hurt, you know?

1963
01:45:13,417 --> 01:45:15,583
I don't wanna go
through that again.

1964
01:45:17,417 --> 01:45:18,750
A heart that's afraid to break

1965
01:45:18,833 --> 01:45:21,250
is a heart that's never used.

1966
01:45:23,583 --> 01:45:25,500
I think the Dalai
Lama said that.

1967
01:45:25,583 --> 01:45:27,167
-Okay.
-Brilliant guy.

1968
01:45:27,250 --> 01:45:29,125
Right, okay.

1969
01:45:29,208 --> 01:45:34,333
So, you were, you
heard, you were there.

1970
01:45:36,750 --> 01:45:38,084
You realize you're
making your point

1971
01:45:38,167 --> 01:45:41,167
by admitting to
more lying, right?

1972
01:45:41,250 --> 01:45:42,500
But I am making my point.

1973
01:45:42,583 --> 01:45:44,750
No, technically it was
my point, originally.

1974
01:45:44,833 --> 01:45:50,583
So, I guess I have no
choice but to accept.

1975
01:45:52,333 --> 01:45:56,084
My point is, I'm
learning to take care

1976
01:45:56,167 --> 01:45:58,417
of the things that I love.

1977
01:46:37,750 --> 01:46:42,833
♪ People like you find it easy ♪

1978
01:46:43,833 --> 01:46:47,584

20, take one, mark.

1987
01:48:23,875 --> 01:48:24,917
Threesome.

1988
01:48:25,000 --> 01:48:27,917
-Let's act.
-All right, let's act.

1989
01:48:28,000 --> 01:48:31,458
And action!

1990
01:48:35,167 --> 01:48:36,750
-You're overreacting.
-I'm properly reacting.

1991
01:48:36,833 --> 01:48:38,667
This is how a normal
person reacts.

1992
01:48:38,750 --> 01:48:41,000
Hey, look, um, uh...

1993
01:48:41,083 --> 01:48:42,875
-You forgot your line?
-Yep.

1994
01:48:42,958 --> 01:48:45,375
We famously already shared
quite a bit together, so.

1995
01:48:47,625 --> 01:48:49,084
Jenny?

1996
01:48:49,167 --> 01:48:51,709
I need to talk... Oh, fuck.

1997
01:48:51,792 --> 01:48:53,834
That was probably the
least successful abortion.

1998
01:48:53,917 --> 01:48:55,417
-Are we shooting?
-Yeah.

1999
01:48:55,500 --> 01:48:56,709
I had no idea, I'm so sorry.

2000
01:48:56,792 --> 01:48:58,084
-Oh, that's okay.
-I'm so sorry.

2001
01:48:58,167 --> 01:49:00,542
To unconventional
first toasts... No.

2002
01:49:00,625 --> 01:49:03,084
-And their corny dates.
-First dates.

2003
01:49:03,167 --> 01:49:05,667
How many pieces do you think
that I could fit in my mouth?

2004
01:49:07,833 --> 01:49:08,917
What do you mean, you're out?

2005
01:49:09,000 --> 01:49:09,917
Good luck, kids.

2006
01:49:10,000 --> 01:49:11,520
This is one for the
fucking storybooks.

2007
01:49:12,583 --> 01:49:14,834
♪ Bless your soul, sweet Jonah ♪

2008
01:49:14,917 --> 01:49:16,334
Bless you.

2009
01:49:16,417 --> 01:49:18,917
So, Jonah's waiting
downstairs, right, and...

2010
01:49:19,000 --> 01:49:20,250
I'm Connor.

2011
01:49:20,333 --> 01:49:21,375
Fuck!

2012
01:49:21,458 --> 01:49:24,333
Want my services as a real
man, I know that Jonah...

2013
01:49:26,250 --> 01:49:28,333
Do you guys, do you
guys like to dance...

2014
01:49:29,333 --> 01:49:31,000
I fucked up.

2015
01:49:31,083 --> 01:49:34,083
Hey, hey.

2016
01:49:35,083 --> 01:49:35,917
What are you doing...

2017
01:49:36,000 --> 01:49:37,000
No, that's crazy.

2018
01:49:37,083 --> 01:49:38,417
Common mark.

2019
01:49:39,667 --> 01:49:41,667
Are you kidding
me, you fucking...

2020
01:49:41,750 --> 01:49:43,083
Yeah.

2021
01:49:46,917 --> 01:49:49,334
Well, that's spoken like
someone who's never felt the...

2022
01:49:49,417 --> 01:49:50,417
I'm so sorry.

2023
01:49:50,500 --> 01:49:53,834
I hate your dumb,
stupid, fat face.

2024
01:49:53,917 --> 01:49:57,167
And you'd be like...
No, fuck me, sorry.

2025
01:49:58,250 --> 01:50:00,542
You accused him of being,

2026
01:50:00,625 --> 01:50:03,083
uh, being, uh...

2027
01:50:04,917 --> 01:50:06,000
You've never looked so good.

2028
01:50:06,083 --> 01:50:07,917
Honestly, you look so nice.

2029
01:50:08,000 --> 01:50:09,125
Mark.

2030
01:50:10,125 --> 01:50:11,209
Mm.

2031
01:50:11,292 --> 01:50:13,875
You worried the drive-thru
worker will see me?

2032
01:50:13,958 --> 01:50:15,709
-I'm sorry.
-What?

2033
01:50:15,792 --> 01:50:17,375
I'm sorry, can you cut?

2034
01:50:18,583 --> 01:50:20,459
Um, mm-hmm.

2035
01:50:20,542 --> 01:50:21,959
I feel like there's
a lot of semen

2036
01:50:22,042 --> 01:50:23,042
clouding your thought right now.

2037
01:50:23,125 --> 01:50:24,250
Is it the tapped keg thing?

2038
01:50:24,333 --> 01:50:26,834
I swear, just foam
came out at one point.

2039
01:50:26,917 --> 01:50:28,834
Like it was, it was like that.

2040
01:50:28,917 --> 01:50:31,167
There's only one
thing I want more

2041
01:50:31,250 --> 01:50:32,334
than to be a grandmother.

2042
01:50:32,417 --> 01:50:34,750
God fucking dammit!

2043
01:50:34,833 --> 01:50:38,250
There's one thing
I'm more excited for.

2044
01:50:38,333 --> 01:50:41,834
There's only one
thing I want more...

2045
01:50:41,917 --> 01:50:43,959
God dammit!

2046
01:50:44,042 --> 01:50:46,209
You can't give me shit
for this, we broke up.

2047
01:50:46,292 --> 01:50:47,667
-I'm so sorry.
-What are you doing?

2048
01:50:47,750 --> 01:50:49,250
You looking for your mark?
-Yeah.

2049
01:50:49,333 --> 01:50:51,084
I've actually never done
this before, so will she...

2050
01:50:51,167 --> 01:50:52,834
You kind of hold her,
help her out a little bit.

2051
01:50:52,917 --> 01:50:53,959
Bit more up, right, like this?

2052
01:50:54,042 --> 01:50:56,084
$1,600?

2053
01:50:56,167 --> 01:50:58,084
That's fine.
-I have a tear.

2054
01:50:58,167 --> 01:50:59,417
-That's good.
-Sorry.

2055
01:50:59,500 --> 01:51:01,958
Get back in there. There's
other scenes for that.

2056
01:51:10,708 --> 01:51:12,250
Well, maybe Olivia Capita...

2057
01:51:12,333 --> 01:51:13,417
What's my name?

2058
01:51:13,500 --> 01:51:14,542
Just...

2059
01:51:15,542 --> 01:51:23,542
Oh, baby.

2060
01:51:25,500 --> 01:51:28,333
You're not helping.

2061
01:51:30,333 --> 01:51:31,584
I told you that
was gonna happen.

2062
01:51:31,667 --> 01:51:32,750
What did you think
was gonna happen?

2063
01:51:32,833 --> 01:51:35,167
You'd swallow it whole?

2064
01:51:35,250 --> 01:51:38,334
Let us consider
the nature of love.

2065
01:51:38,417 --> 01:51:41,334
I think that every successful
relationship finds joy

2066
01:51:41,417 --> 01:51:44,834
in the care and the effort,

2067
01:51:44,917 --> 01:51:46,250
as a collective.

2068
01:51:46,333 --> 01:51:47,917
Speaking of a collective,

2069
01:51:48,000 --> 01:51:50,250
have you guys heard the story
about how Connor and Olivia

2070
01:51:50,333 --> 01:51:52,750
and his baby mama
all got together?

2071
01:51:52,833 --> 01:51:55,917
Oh, no.
