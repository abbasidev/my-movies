1
00:00:18,125 --> 00:00:20,291
-Hi. Hi, all. Hey.
-Hi, Steve.

2
00:00:20,375 --> 00:00:21,500
Um…

3
00:00:21,583 --> 00:00:23,125
-Thanks for coming down.
-No problem.

4
00:00:23,208 --> 00:00:24,875
-Take a seat there.
-Okay.

5
00:00:24,958 --> 00:00:27,208
Angus is gonna put a mic on you.

6
00:00:27,291 --> 00:00:29,541
Sorry, I'm just
gonna pin this to you.

7
00:00:29,625 --> 00:00:32,541
-Then I'll stick that in the side pocket.
-Okay.

8
00:00:32,625 --> 00:00:34,250
-Thank you.
-Okay.

9
00:00:34,333 --> 00:00:36,083
All right.
Sorry about this, Steve.

10
00:00:36,166 --> 00:00:37,833
-It won't take a sec.
-Yeah.

11
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:45,541
-We're rolling.
-I just gotta get rid of this.

12
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:56,750
-You okay to do this?
-Mm-hmm.

13
00:01:02,375 --> 00:01:04,500
I'm probably actually
not okay with it.

14
00:01:05,416 --> 00:01:07,833
Do you mind if you just
stop filming for a sec?

15
00:01:07,916 --> 00:01:09,276
-Yeah.
-Yeah, sure.

16
00:01:16,916 --> 00:01:19,000
-We really don't have to do this now.
-No, no, no.

17
00:01:19,083 --> 00:01:21,791
We should... We should...
We're here. We should do it.

18
00:01:22,583 --> 00:01:23,916
-Let's do it.
-Yeah. Sure?

19
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,125
Yep.

20
00:01:25,208 --> 00:01:26,458
Okay.

21
00:01:28,208 --> 00:01:32,041
Um… so just tell us
a bit about Stanton Wood.

22
00:01:40,166 --> 00:01:43,041
♪ Ayy, ayy-ayy, ayy ♪

23
00:01:43,666 --> 00:01:46,208
♪ Ayy, ayy-ayy, ayy ♪

24
00:01:49,333 --> 00:01:50,583
Okay.

25
00:01:52,458 --> 00:01:56,375
Uh, if Jenny wants to stick
around after her sessions,

26
00:01:56,458 --> 00:01:58,875
then maybe we can
all have a chat.

27
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:04,500
Try and get them
in a room together.

28
00:02:04,583 --> 00:02:05,541
Um…

29
00:02:05,625 --> 00:02:07,333
Riley needs an
intervention, Steven.

30
00:02:07,416 --> 00:02:09,458
Fuck's sake, never
called Nabeel's dad.

31
00:02:09,541 --> 00:02:12,541
Okay, four, call Nabz's dad.

32
00:02:12,625 --> 00:02:16,166
Basically, Steven,
basically, deal with it.

33
00:02:16,250 --> 00:02:18,333
Get through the day.
You're 48 years old.

34
00:02:18,416 --> 00:02:19,958
This is what human beings do.

35
00:02:20,041 --> 00:02:21,666
You're an adult human being.

36
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:23,583
There's
the big confrontation

37
00:02:23,666 --> 00:02:25,416
between friends
and club teammates.

38
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:28,333
An old family argument,
England v. Scotland,

39
00:02:28,416 --> 00:02:32,708
where the losers could most
certainly be out of Euro '96.

40
00:03:00,625 --> 00:03:02,416
Fuck! Oh, my God!

41
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:06,833
-Morning, Shy.
-Wow!

42
00:03:08,583 --> 00:03:10,583
Stealthy Steve, you know?

43
00:03:10,666 --> 00:03:13,041
This isn't great, is it?

44
00:03:13,583 --> 00:03:15,916
-What?
-Oh, come on, Shy.

45
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,916
Tell me you know it's not all right
to be out here at breakfast time

46
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,416
getting fully baked.

47
00:03:23,208 --> 00:03:24,208
Hold this.

48
00:03:32,083 --> 00:03:33,125
Yeah.

49
00:03:33,208 --> 00:03:34,875
-What are you doing?
-No, I…

50
00:03:36,416 --> 00:03:38,416
Dark, yeah.

51
00:03:40,166 --> 00:03:43,500
-It's quite hard, isn't it?
-Hard. Yeah, so hard.

52
00:03:43,583 --> 00:03:47,083
I like... I prefer when it
gets a bit more... when it's spacier.

53
00:03:47,166 --> 00:03:49,166
-Spacey. Love it.
-Synths and all that.

54
00:03:49,666 --> 00:03:51,916
Eh, I could actually
get into that.

55
00:03:54,125 --> 00:03:55,375
So, how are you doing?

56
00:03:56,333 --> 00:03:58,041
I've been worried about you.

57
00:03:58,125 --> 00:03:59,583
I just feel
a bit more, like…

58
00:04:01,791 --> 00:04:05,750
Barbed wire than…
slippy, you know?

59
00:04:06,833 --> 00:04:07,833
Yeah.

60
00:04:08,541 --> 00:04:09,625
I hear you.

61
00:04:11,083 --> 00:04:15,000
You're at the top of my list today,
right? So, we'll find a time to chat.

62
00:04:17,125 --> 00:04:19,333
Someone pissed in my
glass, and I drank a load.

63
00:04:19,416 --> 00:04:21,375
It was probably Jamie.

64
00:04:21,458 --> 00:04:22,916
What? Was that a laugh?

65
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,083
-No, that's terrible.
-You want piss in your mouth?

66
00:04:25,166 --> 00:04:28,541
You have to tell me this
stuff, Shy. It's terrible.

67
00:04:32,125 --> 00:04:33,125
Hey, Steve.

68
00:04:34,458 --> 00:04:35,500
Check this.

69
00:04:35,583 --> 00:04:36,583
Oh, yeah.

70
00:04:38,083 --> 00:04:39,791
Oh, yeah, that's a
beauty, isn't it?

71
00:04:39,875 --> 00:04:41,750
-Yeah, man.
-Love it.

72
00:04:42,708 --> 00:04:43,791
No, you keep it.

73
00:04:45,916 --> 00:04:49,375
I'm gonna sit on the bonnet, you
drive me really slowly into school!

74
00:04:49,458 --> 00:04:51,750
No, absolutely
not. Get off, Shy.

75
00:04:51,833 --> 00:04:55,041
-The film crew can film us arriving.
-What did you say?

76
00:04:55,125 --> 00:04:57,416
The film crew can film us
arriving when we go in.

77
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:59,916
Fuck, it's Thursday! Fuck,
I'm gonna be late. Get off!

78
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,791
-I wanna talk more!
-Get off!

79
00:05:01,875 --> 00:05:04,375
-Come on, Steve. Man, don't be like that.
-Shit. No, Shy.

80
00:05:04,458 --> 00:05:06,042
-Everyone's acting like twats...
-Get off!

81
00:05:06,125 --> 00:05:07,000
Get off!

82
00:05:07,083 --> 00:05:08,458
-Come on, man.
-Shy... All right.

-Yes. Okay.

102

-Um, Steve, Kamila from Points West. Hi.
-Yeah. Hi.

103
00:05:58,416 --> 00:06:02,000
Boys, boys! Boys, come on.
Take it down, take it down.

104
00:06:02,083 --> 00:06:05,041
Jamie, give us a sec here.
Come on. Common room now.

105
00:06:05,125 --> 00:06:06,750
Sorry about
Jamie, he just wants...

106
00:06:06,833 --> 00:06:09,333
Off you get, lads.
Sorry. It's all right.

107
00:06:09,416 --> 00:06:12,041
Um, Steve, this is Geoff,
who's directing the piece.

108
00:06:12,125 --> 00:06:13,708
-Great to meet you.
-Wow. Directing?

109
00:06:13,791 --> 00:06:17,875
They said it was just kind of going to
be just about the school and what we do.

110
00:06:17,958 --> 00:06:20,958
You know, like, five
minutes at the end of the...

111
00:06:21,041 --> 00:06:22,333
I'll fucking slice you!

112
00:06:22,416 --> 00:06:24,333
Five minutes at the end
of the news kind of thing?

113
00:06:24,416 --> 00:06:28,125
Well, yeah, it's Points West,
so it is a segment after the news.

114
00:06:28,208 --> 00:06:30,833
-Um, but it still needs thinking about.
-Yeah.

115
00:06:30,916 --> 00:06:33,125
-This is Angus. He's sound.
-Hiya.

116
00:06:33,208 --> 00:06:36,041
-And Claire is cameras.
-Hiya. Sorry, guys, one second.

117
00:06:36,125 --> 00:06:37,750
-Uh, hey, Shola.
-Hi.

118
00:06:37,833 --> 00:06:39,041
Can I have a quick word?

119
00:06:39,125 --> 00:06:40,875
-Let's go to the staff room.
-Sure.

120
00:06:40,958 --> 00:06:44,416
Sorry, it's just crazy
this morning, um…

121
00:06:45,791 --> 00:06:47,791
Are you, uh, all good? All good?

122
00:06:47,875 --> 00:06:50,083
All good, yeah, um…

123
00:06:52,958 --> 00:06:57,250
Actually, Steve, can we
talk about some stuff?

124
00:06:57,333 --> 00:06:58,833
-Tarone, you know…
-Yes.

125
00:06:59,833 --> 00:07:03,625
Hi, Steve. Can I quickly ask, are we good
to wander upstairs and look at some shots?

126
00:07:03,708 --> 00:07:06,375
-And, um, outside in the garden?
-No, no. Uh, no, no.

127
00:07:06,458 --> 00:07:07,583
No to the boys' rooms.

128
00:07:07,666 --> 00:07:10,916
Yes to wander around, but no to
the boys' rooms, if that's okay.

129
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,958
Shola, yes, yes, 100%.
Yes, we'll speak.

130
00:07:14,041 --> 00:07:16,208
-You're top of my list. Promise.
-Okay.

131
00:07:16,291 --> 00:07:18,083
Um, sorry, guys. Uh, excuse me.

132
00:07:18,166 --> 00:07:20,625
Get off of me,
you fucking cunt!

133
00:07:20,708 --> 00:07:22,250
-Boys!
-I'll kill you!

134
00:07:22,333 --> 00:07:24,166
-Jamie! That's enough!
-I'll kill you!

135
00:07:24,250 --> 00:07:25,291
Riley, Riley, Riley!

136
00:07:25,375 --> 00:07:26,875
-What?
-Jamie!

137
00:07:26,958 --> 00:07:28,083
Get off me!

138
00:07:28,166 --> 00:07:30,042
-Come here, you pussy!
-Fuck off!

139
00:07:30,125 --> 00:07:32,541
-Lads, lads. Lads.
-What?

140
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:36,541
Stupid fat, fucking cunt!

141
00:07:36,625 --> 00:07:39,416
-Riley, stop! Enough!
-Fuck off me, Steve!

142
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:41,083
-Whoa. Riley.
-Come on then!

143
00:07:41,166 --> 00:07:42,208
No, no, no.

144
00:07:42,291 --> 00:07:44,166
No, come on, don't do that.

145
00:07:44,250 --> 00:07:46,875
-Fucking stupid cunt.
-Jamie. Jamie, come on.

146
00:07:46,958 --> 00:07:50,875
-You scratched my face, you little bitch.
-Fuck off, you fucking bloody homo!

147
00:07:50,958 --> 00:07:52,208
-Right.
-You little cunt!

148
00:07:52,291 --> 00:07:55,083
-I'll fucking stab you!
-Pool table privileges gone. Okay.

149
00:07:55,166 --> 00:07:57,166
-That's enough.
-Fucking idiot, man.

150
00:07:57,250 --> 00:07:58,250
Riley, Riley!

151
00:07:58,333 --> 00:07:59,833
Always fucking…

152
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:02,583
Riley, what was that?

153
00:08:03,375 --> 00:08:04,500
Nah.

154
00:08:04,583 --> 00:08:06,916
No, man. He's a fucking sicko.

155
00:08:08,333 --> 00:08:11,541
Okay, let's just take it down,
will we? Use deep breaths.

156
00:08:11,625 --> 00:08:13,916
He's a fucking psycho,
Steve. He's a cunt.

157
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,250
You all see it, but we
have to live with him!

158
00:08:16,333 --> 00:08:18,583
-He's always on us every fucking day!
-No, no.

159
00:08:18,666 --> 00:08:21,333
Come on, you've got to
relax now. Relax, okay?

160
00:08:21,416 --> 00:08:26,000
You and Jamie are actually friends.
You don't know it, but you're friends.

161
00:08:26,083 --> 00:08:28,625
You can't keep having these
little wars. It's no use.

162
00:08:28,708 --> 00:08:31,625
He licked my fucking face,
Steve. He spitted in my mouth.

163
00:08:31,708 --> 00:08:33,041
That's sexual assault.

164
00:08:33,125 --> 00:08:36,708
Okay, Riley, I'm going to say something,
and you're going to roll your eyes at me.

165
00:08:36,791 --> 00:08:39,291
-"You're better than this, Riley."
-Yeah!

166
00:08:39,375 --> 00:08:41,250
I mean, that's pretty much it.

167
00:08:41,333 --> 00:08:45,166
But if you raise your fist at me or
another member of staff ever again,

168
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:47,333
then... then you're gone.

169
00:08:47,416 --> 00:08:48,500
You're out of here.

170
00:08:49,958 --> 00:08:52,708
Okay? I'm here for you, all
right? I'm here for you. Okay?

171
00:08:52,791 --> 00:08:53,625
Thanks, Steve.

172
00:08:53,708 --> 00:08:55,083
Right. Right, let's go.

173
00:08:56,041 --> 00:08:57,791
More focus, less fighting, yeah?

174
00:08:57,875 --> 00:08:58,708
Let's go.

175
00:08:58,791 --> 00:09:00,875
-Some call it a last chance.
-Oh, yeah!

176
00:09:00,958 --> 00:09:03,458
No, Riley. Riley, Riley!

177
00:09:03,541 --> 00:09:05,333
-Shit…
-Hang on. No, again.

178
00:09:05,416 --> 00:09:07,375
-No, I actually really liked it.
-Sorry, sorry.

179
00:09:07,458 --> 00:09:11,625
If you could start further back
and walk more before you start talking.

180
00:09:11,708 --> 00:09:12,833
We got plenty of time.

181
00:09:13,416 --> 00:09:15,458
Some call it a last chance.

182
00:09:15,541 --> 00:09:17,958
Some call it a very
expensive dumping ground

183
00:09:18,041 --> 00:09:20,541
for society's waste product.

184
00:09:20,625 --> 00:09:23,958
A radical progressive
educational intervention

185
00:09:24,041 --> 00:09:26,208
or a waiting room for borstal?

186
00:09:26,291 --> 00:09:28,916
Maybe here, at
Stanton Wood Manor,

187
00:09:29,666 --> 00:09:31,041
it's all of the above.

188
00:09:33,125 --> 00:09:35,375
-Yeah.
-Yeah, that's great.

189
00:09:35,458 --> 00:09:37,166
Shall we try somewhere else?

190
00:09:37,250 --> 00:09:39,416
-Are we rolling?
-Yeah.

191
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:41,916
Fuck! Shit! Cunt! Bollocks!

192
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,416
Riley, 17.

193
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:46,666
And three-quarters.

194
00:09:47,166 --> 00:09:50,125
And, uh, can you
describe yourself in three words?

195
00:09:50,208 --> 00:09:52,375
One, a Cornish legend.

196
00:09:52,458 --> 00:09:53,875
Two, hardcore.

197
00:09:53,958 --> 00:09:56,208
And three, cheeky.

198
00:09:56,291 --> 00:09:57,625
What did Jamie say?

199
00:09:57,708 --> 00:10:00,333
Jamie, uh, said,

200
00:10:01,083 --> 00:10:04,791
"Charismatic, uh, sexy,
and irresistible."

201
00:10:06,083 --> 00:10:08,208
-He's such a twat.
-Last question.

202
00:10:08,291 --> 00:10:12,875
If 1996 Riley could say anything to
1990 Riley, what do you think he'd say?

203
00:10:12,958 --> 00:10:14,083
Hello, Riley.

204
00:10:15,083 --> 00:10:17,208
Don't anyone ever
talk down to you.

205
00:10:17,291 --> 00:10:19,791
Remember who you are, and keep
your fucking head up high.

206
00:10:19,875 --> 00:10:22,041
'Cause you're Riley, yeah?
You're fucking Riley!

207
00:10:31,583 --> 00:10:33,375
Fuck's sake.

208
00:10:46,916 --> 00:10:49,292
…that
will put Jamie next to Riley.

209
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,458
…with Jamie because that
will put Jamie next to Riley.

210
00:10:53,541 --> 00:10:55,583
Maybe Nabz and Shy swap.

211
00:10:57,416 --> 00:10:58,833
That won't fucking work.

212
00:10:58,916 --> 00:11:02,458
Mum, don't bother with that. I
just... I just lost my temper.

213
00:11:02,541 --> 00:11:03,916
That's all it was. Like…

214
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,720
Shy,
stop talking and listen.

215
00:11:06,833 --> 00:11:08,708
That was not okay, Shy.

216
00:11:09,416 --> 00:11:11,375
I was really, really
upset, and we…

217
00:11:12,166 --> 00:11:13,791
lain and I, well, we just can't.

218
00:11:14,791 --> 00:11:16,250
It was the final straw for us.

219
00:11:16,333 --> 00:11:18,958
So we've decided that while
you're at Stanton Wood, we're…

220
00:11:19,708 --> 00:11:20,708
Done.

221
00:11:26,291 --> 00:11:28,541
What… what are
you talking about?

222
00:11:30,291 --> 00:11:32,125
No more phone calls or visits.

223
00:11:34,916 --> 00:11:37,041
What are you saying?

224
00:11:38,125 --> 00:11:40,875
You can't pause contact
with me. I'm your son.

225
00:11:40,958 --> 00:11:42,458
Shut up and listen.

226
00:11:43,541 --> 00:11:44,666
It's over.

227
00:11:46,625 --> 00:11:48,125
You ringing and screaming at me,

228
00:11:48,208 --> 00:11:52,041
insulting us, threatening us, it is
ruining our lives, Shy. It's over.

229
00:11:58,166 --> 00:11:59,625
Ruining your lives?

230
00:12:01,791 --> 00:12:03,416
Mum, you're insane. What?

231
00:12:04,958 --> 00:12:07,500
I never threatened you.
That's just what I…

232
00:12:07,583 --> 00:12:09,958
That's what I get like
sometimes, you know, and…

233
00:12:10,041 --> 00:12:11,041
Yeah, exactly.

234
00:12:12,166 --> 00:12:13,875
That's the point I'm making.

235
00:12:17,625 --> 00:12:19,458
Am… Am I dreaming this?

236
00:12:21,958 --> 00:12:24,125
It's for the best. All
right? For all of us.

237
00:12:26,125 --> 00:12:28,000
W-What if…

238
00:12:31,166 --> 00:12:33,166
What… what if I…
I n... I need you?

239
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:36,166
Shy. I'm 17.

240
00:12:37,083 --> 00:12:38,666
Is Shy your real name?

241
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:39,875
It is now.

242
00:12:39,958 --> 00:12:42,875
And if you could
describe yourself in three words?

243
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:45,041
Uh, depressed.

244
00:12:45,916 --> 00:12:47,458
Angry and bored.

245
00:12:47,541 --> 00:12:49,500
Oh, I'm
sorry to hear that.

246
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:07,375
Peedy Paul, I know you hear me!

247
00:13:07,458 --> 00:13:08,583
-Fucking Peedy Paul!
-Nabz?

248
00:13:08,666 --> 00:13:10,167
I'm gonna come in
and fuckin' kill you!

249
00:13:10,250 --> 00:13:11,083
-Nabz.
-Huh?!

250
00:13:11,166 --> 00:13:14,416
He's been in there for two hours.
I'm not joking. Peedy fucking Paul!

251
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:17,083
No, don't... If you're
desperate, use the other one.

252
00:13:17,166 --> 00:13:20,083
Use the other loo. Paul, come on. Out.

253
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:22,583
Fucking hell.

254
00:13:22,666 --> 00:13:27,000
Rap, jungle, drum and
bass, funky house, fashion.

255
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:29,166
I'm into the
ladies, I can't lie.

256
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:32,000
I'm into styling. I wouldn't
mind being a model, you know?

257
00:13:32,083 --> 00:13:33,916
People say I can get
into modelling, so…

258
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,200
I can't really blame them. I
see where they get it from.

259
00:13:36,791 --> 00:13:37,666
Morning, all.

260
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:40,750
-There you are, Steven. Good.
-You all right out there?

261
00:13:40,833 --> 00:13:42,041
-All right?
-All good.

262
00:13:42,125 --> 00:13:46,041
Today's a total cluster fuck.
There's no other way around it. Okay?

263
00:13:46,125 --> 00:13:48,416
This documentary crew
are going to be filming

264
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:52,375
until at least the end of lessons now,
which is a massive help. Thanks, Steve.

265
00:13:52,458 --> 00:13:55,875
It's a good thing for the school. I
think it'll be a good ad. You know?

266
00:13:55,958 --> 00:13:57,750
-We should embrace it.
-Sure, sure.

267
00:13:57,833 --> 00:13:59,916
They seem like a nice
bunch. I'm fine with it.

268
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,666
But, um, Steven, physio time.
Get yourself lying down.

269
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:04,583
-Okay.
-Okay.

270
00:14:04,666 --> 00:14:07,041
I've told them they've
got to be done by 5:00.

271
00:14:07,125 --> 00:14:09,208
-And they can't interfere with lessons.
-Yeah.

272
00:14:09,291 --> 00:14:11,625
-You know, distract the kids. All right?
-Yeah.

273
00:14:11,708 --> 00:14:13,500
-Have you had your pills?
-Yes.

274
00:14:15,333 --> 00:14:16,416
Oh.

275
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:20,250
Oh, I've just got five minutes, guys.
Then I have to go and deal with Jamie.

276
00:14:20,333 --> 00:14:21,166
Okay.

277
00:14:21,250 --> 00:14:24,916
All right, the main thing is, 11:00
a.m., we've got the trust meeting

278
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,333
with Julian and Charlotte.

279
00:14:26,416 --> 00:14:27,541
Yeah, I know.

280
00:14:27,625 --> 00:14:29,291
Coming in
and wanging on,

281
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:32,666
and telling us we can't have the
heating on next winter? Okay.

282
00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:35,208
I'd like for us to get
together with the boys' folders

283
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:37,666
and just find some time
to get up to speed, yeah?

284
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:39,875
And just join the dots
on where everyone is,

285
00:14:39,958 --> 00:14:42,583
where Jenny's at, and what
our plans are for next term.

286
00:14:42,666 --> 00:14:45,041
-Let's just focus on today.
-Yes.

287
00:14:46,125 --> 00:14:47,166
Good speech, boss.

288
00:14:47,250 --> 00:14:48,500
-Woo!
-Yay!

289
00:14:48,583 --> 00:14:49,583
Yeah, thanks.

290
00:14:49,666 --> 00:14:51,750
Go on, tell us what's on
the board. Let's hear it.

291
00:14:52,333 --> 00:14:58,291
Well, firstly, Andy and Owen, um,
I'm sorry, but you're covering.

292
00:14:58,375 --> 00:15:00,333
-Today, defo, tomorrow, likely.
-Yeah.

293
00:15:00,416 --> 00:15:01,708
-Shola.
-Yeah?

294
00:15:01,791 --> 00:15:03,875
Uh, you're all set, no changes.

295
00:15:03,958 --> 00:15:05,958
Tarone is back in class,
back in with Jenny.

296
00:15:06,041 --> 00:15:07,458
If it's all right with you,

297
00:15:07,541 --> 00:15:09,791
he's going to be back
playing football today.

298
00:15:09,875 --> 00:15:12,000
Um… That's...
that's all good.

299
00:15:12,083 --> 00:15:15,500
If… I'll let Owen know if there's
any hassle during football.

300
00:15:15,583 --> 00:15:18,166
But to be honest, once
them boys see me play…

301
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:19,958
Who's that?
Can we help you?

302
00:15:20,041 --> 00:15:23,375
Yeah, just going to grab that power,
if that's okay, for my battery packs.

303
00:15:23,458 --> 00:15:25,500
-Uh…
-Sure.

304
00:15:25,583 --> 00:15:29,750
Oh, Shola, how are you, uh, how
are you getting on with your, um,

305
00:15:29,833 --> 00:15:32,250
Surround Sound Steve audiobooks?

306
00:15:32,333 --> 00:15:33,583
Has he done his tapes?

307
00:15:33,666 --> 00:15:35,541
Yeah. Very helpful, Steve.

308
00:15:35,625 --> 00:15:37,500
So, my name's Shola Marshall.

309
00:15:37,583 --> 00:15:39,666
I'm 28 years old.

310
00:15:40,166 --> 00:15:44,250
And yeah, I've been at Stanton
Wood for a little over a month now.

311
00:15:44,333 --> 00:15:48,791
We're asking people to
describe themselves in three words.

312
00:15:50,166 --> 00:15:51,708
Oh.

313
00:15:51,791 --> 00:15:53,541
Uh…

314
00:15:53,625 --> 00:15:55,708
I'd say I'm focused.

315
00:15:56,541 --> 00:15:58,291
Dedicated.

316
00:15:59,208 --> 00:16:00,041
Flexible.

317
00:16:00,125 --> 00:16:03,625
Now listen, remember when
they tried to get the local MP

318
00:16:03,708 --> 00:16:05,750
to come do a "meet the
yobbos" photo call?

319
00:16:05,833 --> 00:16:06,833
What's his name?

320
00:16:06,916 --> 00:16:11,166
Uh, uh, Right Honorable Farquhar
Puts His Penis in Farmyard Animals.

321
00:16:11,250 --> 00:16:12,541
-Hey.
-Fuck's sake.

322
00:16:12,625 --> 00:16:14,500
Oh, fuck, Jamie!
I got a fucking…

323
00:16:14,583 --> 00:16:19,125
His name, Steven,
is Hugh Montague-Powell.

324
00:16:19,208 --> 00:16:21,041
-Mm-hmm.
-Pronounced "Pole."

325
00:16:21,125 --> 00:16:22,375
-I see.
-All right. Ya.

326
00:16:22,458 --> 00:16:24,375
Now, he's… he's coming
at 12:00 p.m. today

327
00:16:24,458 --> 00:16:26,500
to be filmed as part of
the Points West thing.

328
00:16:26,583 --> 00:16:27,416
-Okay?
-Okay, fine.

329
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:30,958
He's been in touch with the crew,
he's asked to be shown round the school,

330
00:16:31,041 --> 00:16:33,375
and we've all got to be on
camera shaking his hand,

331
00:16:33,458 --> 00:16:35,375
and thank him for fucking
our country in half.

332
00:16:35,458 --> 00:16:39,916
If 1996 Jamie could say anything
to 1990 Jamie, what would he say?

333
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,875
Shit, we did this
in English. Right.

334
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:45,750
Cool.

335
00:16:46,333 --> 00:16:50,000
Jamie, you sexy little
bastard, give your nan a hug.

336
00:16:50,083 --> 00:16:52,875
Watch out for the little traitor
fuckwads and bitches in this place.

337
00:16:52,958 --> 00:16:54,333
Can't trust any of them.

338
00:16:54,416 --> 00:16:55,708
Carry a blade.

339
00:16:55,791 --> 00:16:58,541
You know what? Fuck the police,
you can't trust them either.

340
00:16:58,625 --> 00:16:59,875
Um…

341
00:16:59,958 --> 00:17:02,000
Don't lend Paul Howarth
your Mr. Scarface tape!

342
00:17:02,083 --> 00:17:04,375
-That's brilliant.
-Hold on a minute, I ain't done.

343
00:17:04,458 --> 00:17:08,291
Jamie, don't go to Freya's house party.
Don't do coke. You're an ecstasy man.

344
00:17:08,375 --> 00:17:11,708
I could write a book. Don't smoke the
squalids Nathan's brother give you.

345
00:17:11,791 --> 00:17:13,871
-Don't headbutt the ginger girl...
-And cut.

346
00:17:14,416 --> 00:17:17,750
Detractors of schools like this
will often point to the costs.

347
00:17:17,833 --> 00:17:24,291
After all, £30,000 per child per year
straight out of the taxpayer's pocket.

348
00:17:24,375 --> 00:17:29,666
Are we paying for badly behaved young
men to attend a luxury private school?

349
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:34,250
Or are we investing in
radical societal surgery,

350
00:17:34,333 --> 00:17:37,291
turning rotten apples
into valuable fruit?

351
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:42,416
Critics of a place like this
will say it's too expensive,

352
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:45,208
too hard to staff,
too dangerous.

353
00:17:45,291 --> 00:17:49,083
The police are here so often, they
have a specially-assigned officer.

354
00:17:49,166 --> 00:17:53,000
It's always so shocking to me,
Jamie, that a man of your taste,

355
00:17:53,083 --> 00:17:57,208
a man of your expertise in
the field of good music,

356
00:17:57,291 --> 00:18:00,041
would consider Tupac
a decent rapper.

357
00:18:01,416 --> 00:18:02,458
As if.

358
00:18:03,458 --> 00:18:08,291
Well, Cal... Cal agrees with me,
Ash agrees with me, Shy agrees...

359
00:18:08,375 --> 00:18:11,500
Now I know you're fucking
winding me up. All right?

360
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:13,833
Posh Cal knows nothing
about anything.

361
00:18:13,916 --> 00:18:16,958
All right? Asking Ash,
that's like asking a fucking…

362
00:18:17,041 --> 00:18:20,083
You know? And Shy wouldn't know
Tupac from Gary fucking Barlow.

363
00:18:20,166 --> 00:18:23,625
-He just does whatever Benny says!
-Jamie, I'm winding you up.

364
00:18:24,333 --> 00:18:26,791
I get it. I agree with you.

365
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:29,333
Steve, you dick.

366
00:18:29,416 --> 00:18:31,833
You know, Jamie, you
can't... This is the thing.

367
00:18:31,916 --> 00:18:35,250
You can't just casually call me
a dick and a poof all the time.

368
00:18:35,333 --> 00:18:37,083
You just… You can't.

369
00:18:40,083 --> 00:18:41,125
Fine.

370
00:18:42,375 --> 00:18:45,458
Fuck's sake, you win. All right?

371
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,125
And I'm sorry for spitting
in Riley's ugly mouth.

372
00:18:51,125 --> 00:18:52,416
Go on.

373
00:18:54,625 --> 00:18:56,708
I know it's not helpful
to wind Riley up,

374
00:18:56,791 --> 00:18:59,541
especially when I said to you
and Jenny that I wouldn't.

375
00:18:59,625 --> 00:19:01,041
I know you've got
a busy day today,

376
00:19:01,125 --> 00:19:03,416
and I pick the worst
moments to start stuff.

377
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:05,291
I also know I'm on
my last warning,

378
00:19:05,375 --> 00:19:08,375
and you can't protect me from
criminal charges if it happens again.

379
00:19:08,458 --> 00:19:10,000
-That's it.
-Yeah.

380
00:19:10,083 --> 00:19:12,916
That's actually it.
And, Jamie, it's really simple.

381
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:16,166
Stop fucking with Shy, okay?
'Cause you're going to break him.

382
00:19:16,250 --> 00:19:19,458
Stop trying to murder Riley all the
time 'cause one day you'll succeed.

383
00:19:19,541 --> 00:19:21,500
He calls me "chubba"
though, Steve.

384
00:19:21,583 --> 00:19:24,000
Yeah, I know. I hear you.

385
00:19:24,958 --> 00:19:27,625
But listen, I know a little bit about
the insult ratios in this house,

386
00:19:27,708 --> 00:19:29,666
and you, my friend,
are top of the charts.

387
00:19:29,750 --> 00:19:33,583
If you give it out all the time,
sometimes you get some in return, right?

388
00:19:33,666 --> 00:19:34,666
It's fair enough.

389
00:19:35,791 --> 00:19:37,541
-Whatever.
-Whatever.

390
00:19:37,625 --> 00:19:41,958
Just... just surprise us by
not always taking the bait.

391
00:19:42,458 --> 00:19:43,625
As if.

392
00:19:43,708 --> 00:19:44,708
As if.

393
00:19:46,291 --> 00:19:49,666
Wow, great teaching, Steve. You're
really fucking wise, aren't you?

394
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:55,291
I won't give up on you,
Jamie. I'll never give up on you.

395
00:19:55,375 --> 00:19:57,166
Come on. Off to English now.

396
00:19:57,250 --> 00:20:00,250
Come on. Enough bollocks.
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

397
00:20:00,333 --> 00:20:04,833
Right. It's, like,
called the body.

398
00:20:04,916 --> 00:20:06,958
And it's fucking
beautiful.

399
00:20:07,041 --> 00:20:10,833
So, we've got this. It's called the bicep.
There's two parts of it, long and short.

400
00:20:10,916 --> 00:20:13,541
On the back, got
the triceps there.

401
00:20:13,625 --> 00:20:16,166
You want to see something
really fucking good?

402
00:20:16,250 --> 00:20:17,666
Okay.

403
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:22,000
-This… is called a work of fucking art.
-Bro, why are you taking your top off?

404
00:20:22,083 --> 00:20:24,916
I'd taken mad, mad whizz.

405
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:28,083
I was really into whizz at the time,
especially with Captain Morgan.

406
00:20:28,166 --> 00:20:31,375
You know, innit? You
know! Good times.

407
00:20:31,458 --> 00:20:33,250
Anyway, to cut a
long story short,

408
00:20:33,333 --> 00:20:36,833
um, I drove into the ticket
office of a tube station

409
00:20:36,916 --> 00:20:39,750
and very nearly killed a fucking
load of people, but I didn't!

410
00:20:39,833 --> 00:20:41,000
Original glazing.

411
00:20:41,083 --> 00:20:42,541
-No, they're not.
-They are.

412
00:20:42,625 --> 00:20:45,125
-Must be hundreds of years old.
-Yeah. Grade I listed.

413
00:20:45,208 --> 00:20:47,541
What does the choice
given to the knight symbolize,

414
00:20:47,625 --> 00:20:53,250
and how does Chaucer use irony to
develop his characters and themes?

415
00:20:53,333 --> 00:20:55,791
-Okay, so where were we in the prologue?
-Ash!

416
00:20:55,875 --> 00:20:56,917
-And who is...
-What?

417
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,250
Riley, Ash,
what's going on?

418
00:20:59,333 --> 00:21:01,125
-Holy shit!
-Guys.

419
00:21:02,916 --> 00:21:04,541
Hey!

420
00:21:04,625 --> 00:21:06,417
-Way too much money.
-Hang on.

421
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:08,000
God, don't break
them windows, mate.

422
00:21:08,083 --> 00:21:09,333
I'm gonna get it!

423
00:21:09,416 --> 00:21:11,583
-What? Oh, brilliant idea.
-They're not gonna let…

424
00:21:11,666 --> 00:21:13,666
-I'm getting it.
-We won't get permission.

425
00:21:17,583 --> 00:21:20,250
-He's fine. We can blur faces.
-It's perfect!

426
00:21:20,333 --> 00:21:22,000
-Bloody hell.
-Look at him.

427
00:21:23,458 --> 00:21:25,750
Guys. Guys!

428
00:21:25,833 --> 00:21:26,958
Exactly what we want.

429
00:21:27,041 --> 00:21:29,333
Are you actually shooting this?
They're not gonna use this.

430
00:21:29,416 --> 00:21:31,583
I hope this is
directed at you and not me.

431
00:21:31,666 --> 00:21:34,708
Why do you hope it's
directed at me? That's off, Geoff.

432
00:21:34,791 --> 00:21:35,791
Well…

433
00:21:35,875 --> 00:21:37,916
You're acting like a bunch
of animals in the zoo.

434
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,625
-Animals in a bloody zoo, innit?
-Tarone, nice to have you back.

435
00:21:41,708 --> 00:21:44,228
-The fuck was that for?
-Shall we get on with it?

436
00:21:47,666 --> 00:21:50,208
Okay, very good. Off
you go. Right, Shy.

437
00:21:52,041 --> 00:21:53,583
-Can you hear?
-Oi, fuck off.

438
00:21:53,666 --> 00:21:55,125
All good here, mate?

439
00:21:57,250 --> 00:22:00,000
Just give me a shout if
you want to chat, okay?

440
00:22:00,083 --> 00:22:02,375
Okay, everybody, ten
more minutes, and then...

441
00:22:02,458 --> 00:22:04,333
You fucking slag!

442
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:21,333
-Hey, it's them.
-Don't bite your nails.

443
00:22:21,833 --> 00:22:23,250
I mean, it's…

444
00:22:23,333 --> 00:22:26,583
What I love about this place every
time, it's like a time capsule.

445
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:31,291
There they are. "Three lions on a
shirt. Jules Rimet still gleaming."

446
00:22:31,375 --> 00:22:32,875
Hi,
Owen. How you doing?

447
00:22:32,958 --> 00:22:35,500
Don't worry about tea,
coffee, biscuits, no poncy stuff.

448
00:22:35,583 --> 00:22:36,750
No, there isn't anything.

449
00:22:36,833 --> 00:22:39,708
Although a glass of
champagne wouldn't go amiss. You know?

450
00:22:39,791 --> 00:22:42,458
Anyway, it's just… The
vibe is just terrific.

451
00:22:42,541 --> 00:22:44,583
Every time I come here,
it just feels like…

452
00:22:44,666 --> 00:22:47,208
Bosh, you know? This is where
the real action happens.

453
00:22:47,291 --> 00:22:50,375
Yeah. Welcome. Good to see you,
Charlotte. Julian, thanks for coming.

454
00:22:50,458 --> 00:22:51,916
-Of course.
-Yes.

455
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:52,833
Any time.

456
00:22:52,916 --> 00:22:54,708
-Yeah. Julian, this meeting...
-Yes?

457
00:22:54,791 --> 00:22:57,833
If you could just get on with
it. I think she really wants you…

458
00:22:57,916 --> 00:23:01,166
-If we could... That was rude of me.
-Yeah, sure. No, no.

459
00:23:01,250 --> 00:23:02,875
It's cool. No problemo. Um…

460
00:23:02,958 --> 00:23:07,875
Well, okay, let me just
start by saying, as always…

461
00:23:08,541 --> 00:23:09,916
Go, you.

462
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,250
Steve, you know,
and all you guys.

463
00:23:12,333 --> 00:23:17,000
What... what you have
achieved here, um…

464
00:23:17,083 --> 00:23:18,250
Well, the…

465
00:23:18,833 --> 00:23:21,333
I was just saying to Charlotte
in the car over…

466
00:23:21,416 --> 00:23:24,833
…what these guys
have achieved is, um…

467
00:23:26,208 --> 00:23:28,416
I'm rambling. Charlotte, please.

468
00:23:28,958 --> 00:23:31,416
Yeah, um… Okay.

469
00:23:32,958 --> 00:23:38,958
So, we had previously talked
about two distinct phases,

470
00:23:39,041 --> 00:23:40,375
um, last time we met.

471
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:46,291
And actually, it seems
like, for various reasons,

472
00:23:46,791 --> 00:23:49,791
those two phases can become one.

473
00:23:49,875 --> 00:23:53,000
So, Stanton Wood
being on the market

474
00:23:53,083 --> 00:23:54,708
has meant that…

475
00:23:55,583 --> 00:23:56,583
Um…

476
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,875
So we vacate the
site in December.

477
00:23:58,958 --> 00:24:01,375
Sorry, can I just stop you
there for a second? Um…

478
00:24:01,458 --> 00:24:04,083
-What are you… What are you saying?
-What?

479
00:24:04,166 --> 00:24:07,458
-Are you... What are you saying?
-"Vacate the site"?

480
00:24:07,541 --> 00:24:10,333
Are you talking about the
trust selling the school?

481
00:24:10,916 --> 00:24:12,041
Um…

482
00:24:13,041 --> 00:24:14,041
Yes.

483
00:24:15,958 --> 00:24:18,833
What's happened is that
we've been able to...

484
00:24:18,916 --> 00:24:20,250
Wait. No, wait a second.

485
00:24:20,333 --> 00:24:22,875
I can't really believe
what I'm hearing here, so…

486
00:24:23,541 --> 00:24:25,541
Wait a second. We have...

487
00:24:25,625 --> 00:24:27,708
You guys have, on
various occasions,

488
00:24:27,791 --> 00:24:31,500
speculatively discussed
how a... a... a closure

489
00:24:31,583 --> 00:24:33,875
might be approached
long-term, logistically.

490
00:24:33,958 --> 00:24:35,458
That's it. Yeah?

491
00:24:36,083 --> 00:24:37,208
-Is that true?
-Yeah.

492
00:24:37,291 --> 00:24:39,541
-Yeah.
-Right? Now you say, all of a sudden…

493
00:24:39,625 --> 00:24:42,125
What? You're just saying
you're just doing it?

494
00:24:42,208 --> 00:24:43,791
Am I…?

495
00:24:43,875 --> 00:24:49,000
Charlotte, you said… you said, uh,
um, vacate the site in… in December.

496
00:24:49,083 --> 00:24:50,750
So, are you… are you…

497
00:24:51,875 --> 00:24:54,833
Are you talking about closing the
school in… in less than 18 months' time?

498
00:24:54,916 --> 00:24:56,375
-Is that what you're saying?
-My God.

499
00:24:56,458 --> 00:24:57,791
Um…

500
00:24:57,875 --> 00:25:00,000
Um… Steve…

501
00:25:00,541 --> 00:25:04,333
We're talking about
December 1996.

502
00:25:04,416 --> 00:25:06,333
-We're going to be, um…
-What six months' time?

503
00:25:06,416 --> 00:25:09,541
-In the middle of the school year?
-Okay! Okay, okay, guys.

504
00:25:09,625 --> 00:25:11,625
-You're kidding me!
-If you could just let me speak.

505
00:25:11,708 --> 00:25:13,291
If you could just let me speak.

506
00:25:13,375 --> 00:25:15,833
Tell us a bit
about Stanton Wood.

507
00:25:15,916 --> 00:25:17,791
It's sort of like a
prototype, you know?

508
00:25:17,875 --> 00:25:20,458
To bring kind of more of a
rehabilitative approach to…

509
00:25:20,541 --> 00:25:23,750
To residential schooling, you know? It's
based off a Finnish model, actually.

510
00:25:23,833 --> 00:25:26,333
Sorry, Steve.
Sorry. Can we just go again?

511
00:25:26,416 --> 00:25:28,500
You still look
quite emotional and…

512
00:25:28,583 --> 00:25:30,750
No, no. Do I? I'm fine.

513
00:25:30,833 --> 00:25:33,583
Spectacularly
unsustainable in today's climate.

514
00:25:33,666 --> 00:25:35,208
Shut up, man.

515
00:25:36,083 --> 00:25:37,666
-Sorry?
-Just shut up.

516
00:25:37,750 --> 00:25:40,708
Steve, come on, buddy.
We knew this day was coming...

517
00:25:40,791 --> 00:25:43,500
Stop talking. Just stop talking.

518
00:25:43,583 --> 00:25:45,000
Stop talking!

519
00:25:45,083 --> 00:25:49,208
Or I'll climb over this table, and
I'll strangle you with my bare hands!

520
00:25:49,291 --> 00:25:52,916
-How would you like that, Julian?
-Death threats are a little much!

521
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,166
Shut up!

522
00:25:54,250 --> 00:25:57,500
-Shut up! Shut up!
-Whoa! Steve! Steve!

523
00:25:58,083 --> 00:26:00,083
Shut up!

524
00:26:01,166 --> 00:26:02,500
Wow.

525
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:07,041
-Oh, my God.
-God… Steve…

526
00:26:08,791 --> 00:26:09,916
Got ya.

527
00:26:13,750 --> 00:26:19,500
Th… Th… These are extraordinarily
complex, uh, young people, these lads.

528
00:26:20,083 --> 00:26:22,041
Extraordinarily complex.

529
00:26:22,125 --> 00:26:26,208
And as you know, we have zero legal
jurisdiction to keep them here.

530
00:26:26,291 --> 00:26:32,458
So, on top of every moral, and…
and logistical, and emotional, and…

531
00:26:32,541 --> 00:26:37,458
And… and educational catastrophe
you're about to visit on them,

532
00:26:37,541 --> 00:26:38,916
I think that if… if…

533
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:42,250
If you say the school is closing
in the middle of the school term,

534
00:26:42,333 --> 00:26:43,333
then they're gone.

535
00:26:44,416 --> 00:26:46,750
We have to care for these kids.

536
00:26:46,833 --> 00:26:48,125
This is their home.

537
00:26:48,208 --> 00:26:52,208
This is a place that's in the
process of saving their lives.

538
00:26:52,291 --> 00:26:53,333
You know?

539
00:26:53,416 --> 00:27:00,375
There is busy, messy, wildly complex shit
going on here, there, and everywhere.

540
00:27:00,458 --> 00:27:02,000
Each day, every day.

541
00:27:02,083 --> 00:27:03,541
I mean, you…

542
00:27:03,625 --> 00:27:04,916
You cannot

543
00:27:05,666 --> 00:27:07,083
just stop.

544
00:27:07,166 --> 00:27:09,916
You can't press a button
and say, "No more."

545
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:13,000
You know? I mean, we need
much, much more time.

546
00:27:17,125 --> 00:27:18,208
Okay.

547
00:27:19,791 --> 00:27:21,125
Charlotte, go on.

548
00:27:24,875 --> 00:27:26,291
It's…

549
00:27:26,791 --> 00:27:28,125
It's too late.

550
00:27:28,916 --> 00:27:31,708
It's happening. We've
sold Stanton Wood.

551
00:27:35,666 --> 00:27:37,458
-God…
-I'm sorry.

552
00:27:37,541 --> 00:27:40,333
-Give me a second. I can't deal with it.
-Yeah.

553
00:27:49,833 --> 00:27:52,875
Why don't we start summarizing
your relationship with the boys?

554
00:27:52,958 --> 00:27:54,125
What do you think of them?

555
00:27:54,708 --> 00:27:56,375
Official answer.

556
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:01,916
They are hugely complicated,
intricate human beings

557
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:06,750
who require enormous amounts of what
we'd now call special educational care.

558
00:28:06,833 --> 00:28:11,458
It's exhausting, complicated,
demanding work, and it's destroying us.

559
00:28:11,541 --> 00:28:14,875
We are underpaid,
we're understaffed,

560
00:28:14,958 --> 00:28:17,541
we're chronically
under-resourced.

561
00:28:17,625 --> 00:28:21,625
I am part prison
guard, I'm part nurse,

562
00:28:21,708 --> 00:28:25,333
I'm part battleaxe,
I'm part mummy.

563
00:28:25,416 --> 00:28:27,916
I'm part… You know, you get me.

564
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,041
-Yeah, I hear you.
-Um…

565
00:28:31,666 --> 00:28:33,625
-Unofficial answer?
-Go on.

566
00:28:35,458 --> 00:28:37,166
I fucking adore them.

567
00:28:51,041 --> 00:28:52,083
Fuck.

568
00:28:56,666 --> 00:29:00,208
What the fuck do you
mean? They were asking me…

569
00:29:20,541 --> 00:29:21,708
Hey, Steve.

570
00:29:25,708 --> 00:29:28,250
-I'm so, so angry right now.
-I know.

571
00:29:29,291 --> 00:29:30,416
I know.

572
00:29:31,916 --> 00:29:33,208
I've got ya.

573
00:29:33,291 --> 00:29:35,625
I'm so angry. I don't
know what to do.

574
00:29:37,458 --> 00:29:38,958
Oh, God.

575
00:29:42,541 --> 00:29:46,416
Our beautiful, fucking
terrible boys, Steve.

576
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:47,750
I know.

577
00:29:48,958 --> 00:29:51,458
-Our boys.
-I know. I know.

578
00:29:51,541 --> 00:29:52,958
I know…

579
00:29:53,750 --> 00:29:55,916
We'll carry them
through this, and we'll…

580
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,833
One by one, yeah?
Like we always have.

581
00:30:00,166 --> 00:30:02,125
-Like we always have.
-Yeah.

582
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:07,583
You know, they… they won't
let us anywhere near 'em.

583
00:30:07,666 --> 00:30:09,291
You know?

584
00:30:09,375 --> 00:30:15,125
Steve, in a minute… in a minute,
we're going to be out on our arses,

585
00:30:15,208 --> 00:30:17,625
unemployed fucking
strangers, you know?

586
00:30:17,708 --> 00:30:19,625
-I know, but we're here now.
-And then…

587
00:30:19,708 --> 00:30:21,250
We've got 'til like Christmas…

588
00:30:21,333 --> 00:30:22,375
We're here now, Amanda.

589
00:30:22,458 --> 00:30:24,875
-We'll probably never see them again.
-Here you are.

590
00:30:25,583 --> 00:30:28,041
Give me a shout
if you need help.

591
00:30:31,125 --> 00:30:35,083
So, uh, Shy and Benny, yeah? The
drum and bass nerve center, I'm told.

592
00:30:35,166 --> 00:30:36,541
Nah, listen, listen, innit?

593
00:30:36,625 --> 00:30:40,375
Atomic Bass Recordings, yeah, will be
bigger than anything you've ever seen.

594
00:30:40,458 --> 00:30:43,541
You see Shy? He's the CEO. He'll
run, like, the label side of stuff.

595
00:30:43,625 --> 00:30:45,500
See me? I'm the day-to-day
boss of the club.

596
00:30:45,583 --> 00:30:48,250
-Nightclub?
-Yeah, it's all in one huge building.

597
00:30:48,333 --> 00:30:52,125
Offices upstairs, shop and studio, and
then there's a club in the basement.

598
00:30:52,208 --> 00:30:54,666
Fucking polytunnels on the
roof growing the crops.

599
00:30:54,750 --> 00:30:56,625
-Yeah, of course.
-This is in London, yeah?

600
00:30:56,708 --> 00:30:58,791
-Yeah, yeah, yeah. 100%.
-Yeah, listen.

601
00:30:58,875 --> 00:31:01,458
Also, we have to build it like
a fortress, because, see, Shy,

602
00:31:01,541 --> 00:31:04,583
he's kind of a wanted man where he's
from. So, we have to protect the governor,

603
00:31:04,666 --> 00:31:06,166
the Shy One, the jungle bunny.

604
00:31:06,250 --> 00:31:08,416
Why is that? Sorry,
do you mind me asking?

605
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:11,125
Shy's a wanted man. He cut a
lad's face open with a bottle.

606
00:31:11,208 --> 00:31:12,708
-Shh!
-Nabeel, stop talking.

607
00:31:12,791 --> 00:31:14,875
Stop talking. This
is not… not okay.

608
00:31:14,958 --> 00:31:16,125
-Steve.
-Stop filming.

609
00:31:16,208 --> 00:31:18,750
Please. Like, we...
we... You said…

610
00:31:18,833 --> 00:31:21,542
Even if you blur out their faces,
legally, you can't have them talking…

611
00:31:21,625 --> 00:31:23,208
-He's here!
-It's not appropriate.

612
00:31:23,291 --> 00:31:24,750
-I understand.
-I thought we...

613
00:31:24,833 --> 00:31:27,167
-They're waiting for you in the hallway.
-Thanks. I'm coming.

614
00:31:27,250 --> 00:31:28,791
Guys, can you
please stop filming?

615
00:31:28,875 --> 00:31:30,750
-Look, I… I can't…
-I'm not happy with this.

616
00:31:30,833 --> 00:31:31,833
None of that's staying in.

617
00:31:31,916 --> 00:31:33,875
-I'm not happy. It's not staying in.
-I understand.

618
00:31:33,958 --> 00:31:36,791
Steve, Steve, I'm… I'm so
sorry. Well, it's cool…

619
00:31:36,875 --> 00:31:38,666
I'm very sorry. It's
not cool, actually.

620
00:31:38,750 --> 00:31:41,291
-You have our absolute assurance…
-Steve, he's waitin'!

621
00:31:41,375 --> 00:31:44,791
No, no. This guy is coming now. He's
only here because you guys are here.

622
00:31:44,875 --> 00:31:47,000
So, film him, and
then we're done!

623
00:31:47,083 --> 00:31:48,291
Fuck's sake.

624
00:31:53,416 --> 00:31:56,750
-Hello there. Hi there. I'm… I'm Steven.
-Hello, hello, Steven.

625
00:31:56,833 --> 00:31:59,000
Hello, nice to meet
you. Come on this way.

626
00:31:59,083 --> 00:32:00,125
That's enough!

627
00:32:01,125 --> 00:32:03,458
-This is Amanda.
-Welcome to Stanton Wood.

628
00:32:03,541 --> 00:32:05,000
-Amanda.
-I'm Amanda, deputy head.

629
00:32:05,083 --> 00:32:05,958
Henry Harvey.

630
00:32:06,041 --> 00:32:08,875
Uh, this is Sarah. She's
part of our wonderful team.

631
00:32:08,958 --> 00:32:09,958
Sarah.

632
00:32:10,666 --> 00:32:11,833
Let's go this way.

633
00:32:12,541 --> 00:32:14,500
This is, um…
quite something.

634
00:32:14,583 --> 00:32:20,125
So, uh, I suppose this is a kind
of a social area, recreation area.

635
00:32:20,208 --> 00:32:21,958
Look, he's there. He's coming.

636
00:32:22,041 --> 00:32:24,583
And… everyone's
waiting! Here we are.

637
00:32:24,666 --> 00:32:28,375
Right, everybody, take a seat.
There should be enough seats.

638
00:32:28,458 --> 00:32:29,458
Great.

639
00:32:30,416 --> 00:32:34,541
Uh, so, everyone,
this is Hugh Montague…

640
00:32:34,625 --> 00:32:37,333
-Sorry, I'm not sure the correct…
-Sir Hugh Montague...

641
00:32:37,416 --> 00:32:39,416
Powell. Montague-Powell.

642
00:32:40,125 --> 00:32:42,041
Spelled "Powell,"
pronounced "Pole."

643
00:32:42,125 --> 00:32:44,375
-Like Anthony.
-"Pole."

644
00:32:44,458 --> 00:32:46,208
Eh… But who cares, eh?

645
00:32:47,583 --> 00:32:50,666
-Well, welcome to Stanton Wood.
-Thank you.

646
00:32:52,166 --> 00:32:56,416
Well, Mr. "Pole",
Sir Benjamin Griffith here.

647
00:32:57,083 --> 00:32:59,583
Very good. Well met, Benjamin.

648
00:33:01,125 --> 00:33:06,500
Now, boys, you'll know this
because you're all bright, young chaps,

649
00:33:06,583 --> 00:33:10,375
but I'm your local
parliamentary representative,

650
00:33:10,458 --> 00:33:12,041
your MP.

651
00:33:12,125 --> 00:33:15,791
So, uh, I toil away in
Westminster making decisions

652
00:33:15,875 --> 00:33:18,958
about everything
from foreign wars

653
00:33:19,041 --> 00:33:20,750
to the price of beans,

654
00:33:20,833 --> 00:33:23,083
to teachers' pay.

655
00:33:25,875 --> 00:33:29,291
And very soon, uh,
you'll be getting a vote,

656
00:33:30,208 --> 00:33:32,500
provided you stay out of prison,

657
00:33:32,583 --> 00:33:35,208
and you'll want to use
that vote very wisely.

658
00:33:35,291 --> 00:33:38,375
You'll want to think about
who will protect your money,

659
00:33:38,458 --> 00:33:41,833
your possessions, your freedoms.

660
00:33:41,916 --> 00:33:43,750
But we ain't got none of them.

661
00:33:43,833 --> 00:33:45,291
Sorry, say again?

662
00:33:45,375 --> 00:33:46,583
Don't matter.

663
00:33:47,333 --> 00:33:51,458
Uh, the lads have been
doing, uh, democracy.

664
00:33:52,958 --> 00:33:59,166
You know, just, uh,
discussing d… democracy, uh…

665
00:33:59,250 --> 00:34:02,125
Unpacking it in their
Russia and Communism course.

666
00:34:02,208 --> 00:34:03,500
Well, there you have it.

667
00:34:03,583 --> 00:34:04,750
I've been working...

668
00:34:04,833 --> 00:34:08,125
When I'm not whizzing around
meeting people like you,

669
00:34:08,208 --> 00:34:12,791
I'm working hard to make sure
we don't go down that route.

670
00:34:12,875 --> 00:34:16,333
Communist Britain would not
be the green and pleasant land

671
00:34:16,416 --> 00:34:18,875
we currently all so enjoy.

672
00:34:18,958 --> 00:34:20,166
Brilliant.

673
00:34:21,208 --> 00:34:23,583
Okay, brilliant. That was great.

674
00:34:23,666 --> 00:34:26,083
Inspiring for the lads. Um…
Take a few photographs...

675
00:34:26,166 --> 00:34:29,750
Any questions about what
goes on up in the smoke?

676
00:34:33,416 --> 00:34:36,541
Come on, lads, you're not
usually backwards in coming forward.

677
00:34:37,166 --> 00:34:39,375
Princess Di gossip?
State secrets?

678
00:34:39,458 --> 00:34:41,666
Come on, gents, ask away.

679
00:34:42,958 --> 00:34:44,041
Yes, young man?

680
00:34:45,416 --> 00:34:47,958
I wondered if, sir,

681
00:34:48,041 --> 00:34:51,500
is it a part of the training
for, like, becoming an MP,

682
00:34:51,583 --> 00:34:54,166
or have you always been a cunt?

683
00:34:56,583 --> 00:34:57,583
-What...
-Shy!

684
00:34:57,666 --> 00:34:59,416
He'll just fucking say anything.

685
00:34:59,500 --> 00:35:00,833
What the fuck?

686
00:35:00,916 --> 00:35:01,750
Sir.

687
00:35:01,833 --> 00:35:03,625
That's what I
was wondering, though.

688
00:35:03,708 --> 00:35:05,250
You won't be using that.

689
00:35:05,333 --> 00:35:07,625
I wanted to...
to ask my question.

690
00:35:07,708 --> 00:35:10,416
We can ask questions though.
You said he could ask questions.

691
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:12,167
-Can I ask you a question?
-"Pole"!

692
00:35:12,250 --> 00:35:13,583
You said that I could ask…

693
00:35:13,666 --> 00:35:15,250
Okay, everyone.

694
00:35:15,333 --> 00:35:16,166
"Pole"!

695
00:35:16,250 --> 00:35:18,541
Please answer
the question, Mr. Powell.

696
00:35:31,041 --> 00:35:32,833
It's bullshit.
It's fucking racist.

697
00:35:32,916 --> 00:35:36,416
That's interesting, Tarone.
Why do you think it's racist?

698
00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:38,083
I don't
know. You tell me.

699
00:35:38,166 --> 00:35:41,500
Okay, if that's what
you want to do, fine.

700
00:35:41,583 --> 00:35:43,916
Maybe that's a good idea, um…

701
00:35:45,083 --> 00:35:46,375
Perhaps you feel

702
00:35:46,458 --> 00:35:49,166
that if one of the other
boys had spoken to Shola

703
00:35:49,250 --> 00:35:52,166
in the way that you spoke to
her, said those things to her,

704
00:35:52,250 --> 00:35:54,708
they would be punished
in a different way.

705
00:35:54,791 --> 00:35:55,791
You get me.

706
00:35:57,375 --> 00:36:01,208
'Cause I'm Black, and she's Black, and
they don't know what the fuck to do,

707
00:36:01,291 --> 00:36:03,375
and they think I'm
some weirdo, a rapist…

708
00:36:03,458 --> 00:36:07,166
Okay, I'm going to stop you
there. I quite strongly disagree.

709
00:36:07,250 --> 00:36:11,333
Of course you do, Jenny. 'Cause
you're all the exact fucking same.

710
00:36:11,416 --> 00:36:12,416
Careful, Tarone.

711
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,125
I'll say how it looks
from here. May I?

712
00:36:18,208 --> 00:36:19,416
Go on, tell me.

713
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:22,958
One month special detention
and extra sessions with me

714
00:36:23,041 --> 00:36:27,541
for repeated instances of
sexual innuendo, abuse,

715
00:36:27,625 --> 00:36:33,125
and one instance of severely inappropriate
physical behavior towards Shola.

716
00:36:36,583 --> 00:36:39,708
You know, if you'd been hauled out of
here and the police had been called…

717
00:36:39,791 --> 00:36:40,708
Yeah.

718
00:36:40,791 --> 00:36:43,750
…I might wonder if they
were being even-handed.

719
00:36:43,833 --> 00:36:45,458
But look at Riley.

720
00:36:46,125 --> 00:36:47,916
Look at Jamie earlier this year.

721
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:51,791
I think the punishments
are extremely even-handed.

722
00:36:51,875 --> 00:36:54,458
Thoughtful. Mild, even.

723
00:36:54,541 --> 00:36:56,250
In a normal school,

724
00:36:56,333 --> 00:37:00,875
if you'd said those things to Shola, you
would have been expelled, no question.

725
00:37:00,958 --> 00:37:03,333
And Shola could have
pressed charges.

726
00:37:09,583 --> 00:37:11,375
Oh, Sarah,
this looks lovely.

727
00:37:11,458 --> 00:37:13,083
-Thank you, Sarah.
-Looks lovely.

728
00:37:13,166 --> 00:37:15,083
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

729
00:37:15,166 --> 00:37:17,666
-Took mine as well.
-Come on, leave it now.

730
00:37:17,750 --> 00:37:19,791
You're not Alan Shearer.
You scored one goal.

731
00:37:19,875 --> 00:37:21,000
-It's mine.
-No.

732
00:37:21,083 --> 00:37:22,625
You didn't. What the fuck?

733
00:37:24,291 --> 00:37:26,708
He just stole
that off you like a baby.

734
00:37:26,791 --> 00:37:28,166
Nah, bruv. I'll take it.

735
00:37:29,166 --> 00:37:31,291
-Don't start.
-Fuck, man!

736
00:37:33,708 --> 00:37:34,750
Yeah, listen.

737
00:37:34,833 --> 00:37:37,375
Well done for not getting
rapey with Shola again today.

738
00:37:37,458 --> 00:37:38,708
What?

739
00:37:38,791 --> 00:37:41,833
Yeah. Though she does look
fit, innit, doesn't she?

740
00:37:44,833 --> 00:37:45,916
Ooh…

741
00:37:46,791 --> 00:37:48,791
-Oh, my fuck!
-Shit, yeah?

742
00:37:48,875 --> 00:37:49,916
Pack it in!

743
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,666
Fucking hell. Come on,
what? What, pussy? What?

744
00:37:52,750 --> 00:37:54,791
Get out of the kitchen!

745
00:37:54,875 --> 00:37:56,000
Give it to him!

746
00:37:56,083 --> 00:37:57,708
-Stop it!
-Fucking have it!

747
00:37:57,791 --> 00:37:59,416
How many
times have I told you?

748
00:38:03,333 --> 00:38:04,583
Oh, fucking hell.

749
00:38:06,250 --> 00:38:09,625
Tell me. Why are you running, man?
Why are you running, Jamie? Huh?!

750
00:38:09,708 --> 00:38:11,125
Ooh!

751
00:38:11,208 --> 00:38:12,541
Fucking prick!

752
00:38:15,208 --> 00:38:16,250
Ah, fuck!

753
00:38:20,583 --> 00:38:21,416
Come on!

754
00:38:27,833 --> 00:38:30,375
-Move!
-Oi, smack him up!

755
00:38:30,958 --> 00:38:34,083
No! Stop!

756
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,416
Everyone, just
calm the fuck down!

757
00:38:50,625 --> 00:38:52,625
-Fucking little shit!
-Oh, shit!

758
00:38:53,125 --> 00:38:54,291
Fuck.

759
00:38:55,291 --> 00:38:57,791
Why do you have to be
such a prick all the time?

760
00:38:57,875 --> 00:38:58,833
What?

761
00:38:58,916 --> 00:39:00,875
Why do you have to be
a prick all the time?

762
00:39:00,958 --> 00:39:02,666
-I'll fucking murder you, Shy!
-No!

763
00:39:02,750 --> 00:39:04,833
-I'll fucking murder you!
-Enough! Enough!

764
00:39:04,916 --> 00:39:10,916
If 1996 Shy could say anything
to 1990 Shy, what would he say?

765
00:39:14,250 --> 00:39:16,250
Honestly, I just
can't be arsed for it.

766
00:39:16,333 --> 00:39:17,791
Okay, let's stop.

767
00:39:17,875 --> 00:39:21,166
No, I want to do the thing. I just
meant with myself. I just hate it.

768
00:39:21,250 --> 00:39:24,208
My... Myself, sometimes.

769
00:39:24,291 --> 00:39:27,166
Ah, well,
okay. Let's stop then.

770
00:39:27,250 --> 00:39:28,791
I want to do it.

771
00:39:28,875 --> 00:39:29,916
Okay.

772
00:39:30,666 --> 00:39:33,500
I was so obsessed
with getting weed, and fags,

773
00:39:33,583 --> 00:39:36,375
and lemon Hooch, and…

774
00:39:37,666 --> 00:39:38,833
And rum.

775
00:39:41,041 --> 00:39:43,583
I wanted to get
wasted all the time

776
00:39:43,666 --> 00:39:46,541
and be agg to my
mum and stepdad.

777
00:39:48,125 --> 00:39:51,500
I hurt a kid really badly.

778
00:39:53,625 --> 00:39:55,875
And I stabbed my stepdad.

779
00:39:55,958 --> 00:39:56,916
Oh, shit.

780
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,583
Only in the finger. He's fine.

781
00:39:59,666 --> 00:40:00,958
It actually…

782
00:40:01,041 --> 00:40:02,333
It ended up…

783
00:40:04,208 --> 00:40:07,625
It ended up being a
bonding thing with us.

784
00:40:07,708 --> 00:40:09,666
And he's got chubby
fingers, anyway.

785
00:40:09,750 --> 00:40:12,208
Yeah, he's a prick.

786
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,708
Steve told us specifically
not to do this.

787
00:40:17,791 --> 00:40:20,208
I think he meant when
there are boys in the room.

788
00:40:20,291 --> 00:40:23,000
-I'm not okay with this.
-It's fine, the rooms are empty.

789
00:40:23,083 --> 00:40:25,750
Come in here, Claire.
Get some of this artwork.

790
00:40:25,833 --> 00:40:27,917
-Claire, don't film this!
-It's okay.

791
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:32,333
He doesn't like to talk about it, but
Steve was in a serious car accident

792
00:40:32,416 --> 00:40:33,833
about two…

793
00:40:33,916 --> 00:40:37,041
Actually, it's like, more
than three years ago now,

794
00:40:37,125 --> 00:40:38,291
and it was not good.

795
00:40:38,375 --> 00:40:42,250
I mean, literally, you know, cutting
him out of the car on a roundabout.

796
00:40:42,333 --> 00:40:44,083
Oh.

797
00:40:44,166 --> 00:40:46,291
-Right, shall we go now?
-Oh, my God.

798
00:40:46,375 --> 00:40:47,916
Um…

799
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,125
God.

800
00:40:50,375 --> 00:40:52,416
-"Shy."
-Shy.

801
00:40:53,500 --> 00:40:55,708
-Just looks like a nice kid.
-Yeah.

802
00:40:55,791 --> 00:40:57,750
-Geoff, can you clear the frame?
-I'm...

803
00:40:57,833 --> 00:40:59,833
I'm not sure about
going through the drawers.

804
00:40:59,916 --> 00:41:02,500
-Maybe just what's on the shelf.
-It's breaking.

805
00:41:02,583 --> 00:41:05,791
-Fucking hell! What's in here?
-"Atomic Bass Recordings."

806
00:41:05,875 --> 00:41:07,458
Have you seen how heavy this is?

807
00:41:09,291 --> 00:41:10,875
Go on, have a look.

808
00:41:13,791 --> 00:41:15,166
Um…

809
00:41:16,208 --> 00:41:19,000
Literally
a bag of rocks.

810
00:41:48,458 --> 00:41:50,041
Thank you.

811
00:41:50,583 --> 00:41:53,791
Please respect me enough to
listen to what I have to say.

812
00:41:58,666 --> 00:42:00,500
You know, actually,
I'm thinking,

813
00:42:00,583 --> 00:42:04,333
if we're looking for a reason
you're not getting REM sleep,

814
00:42:05,541 --> 00:42:08,250
we need look no further
than this music, right?

815
00:42:09,416 --> 00:42:12,166
It's very fast and
choppy and metallic.

816
00:42:12,250 --> 00:42:14,375
It's very "on".

817
00:42:14,958 --> 00:42:16,125
Isn't it, Shy?

818
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,500
We've been making such
good progress recently.

819
00:42:32,916 --> 00:42:34,708
Oh, dear. Okay.

820
00:42:39,250 --> 00:42:41,125
Has something happened
with your mum and lain?

821
00:42:41,208 --> 00:42:44,375
Has there been some kind of trouble
I've not been made aware of?

822
00:42:46,666 --> 00:42:49,375
Everything all right with
Benny? Plans for the label?

823
00:42:55,500 --> 00:42:57,500
You still enjoying science?

824
00:42:58,958 --> 00:43:00,125
Geology?

825
00:43:01,708 --> 00:43:05,041
Why don't we get out
one of your charts?

826
00:43:13,375 --> 00:43:17,291
Stop pretending you know me!

827
00:43:18,083 --> 00:43:21,000
You don't know me!

828
00:43:22,083 --> 00:43:24,083
You only know what I tell you!

829
00:43:24,166 --> 00:43:25,166
Okay, Shy.

830
00:44:00,291 --> 00:44:03,042
-Cal, you're finished, by the way.
-Smashed through it.

831
00:44:03,125 --> 00:44:04,625
Punch the gay boy already!

832
00:44:04,708 --> 00:44:05,875
-Like, boom!
-Ow!

833
00:44:06,875 --> 00:44:08,750
Stop being a girl. Go on, Cal.

834
00:44:08,833 --> 00:44:10,416
Get him back.

835
00:44:10,500 --> 00:44:13,333
Shy. Shy, can I…

836
00:44:13,416 --> 00:44:14,250
Huh?

837
00:44:14,333 --> 00:44:17,583
-Can I take you for two minutes?
-I know what you're gonna say, though.

838
00:44:17,666 --> 00:44:20,125
Come on, just out in the
corridor. Two seconds.

839
00:44:23,250 --> 00:44:27,000
Said I'm such a girl, bro.
I'm fucking missing that shit.

840
00:44:33,333 --> 00:44:34,916
Um…

841
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:36,833
So…

842
00:44:37,750 --> 00:44:39,708
I heard about what
happened with Jenny.

843
00:44:42,666 --> 00:44:45,041
Good news is, the chair
isn't pressing charges.

844
00:44:47,625 --> 00:44:49,291
So funny, man.

845
00:44:50,708 --> 00:44:51,708
Shy…

846
00:44:52,541 --> 00:44:54,166
Okay, that was a bad gag.

847
00:44:54,250 --> 00:44:56,458
Right? It was a... It was naff.

848
00:45:00,833 --> 00:45:04,208
Listen, I think we've always
been honest with each other.

849
00:45:04,291 --> 00:45:06,708
I can tell there's
something up with you,

850
00:45:06,791 --> 00:45:11,666
and all I want for you
to do is to just use us.

851
00:45:11,750 --> 00:45:14,416
You know, use the people
here that care for you.

852
00:45:15,125 --> 00:45:16,125
Speak to us.

853
00:45:16,208 --> 00:45:20,000
Just me, or Amanda, or
even the lads. Whoever.

854
00:45:20,708 --> 00:45:24,583
'Cause you're not alone,
Shy. That's the whole point.

855
00:45:28,500 --> 00:45:29,500
Come on.

856
00:45:32,250 --> 00:45:34,958
Or call your mum, and then
she can come with lain,

857
00:45:35,041 --> 00:45:36,541
and we can all
have a discussion.

858
00:45:36,625 --> 00:45:37,917
-Oh, my God.
-Talk it out.

859
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,916
Just actually fuck off, Steve!

860
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:44,250
Dude, I don't want to
talk. I am sick of talking.

861
00:45:44,333 --> 00:45:46,083
I am sick of Jenny.

862
00:45:46,166 --> 00:45:47,750
And I'm sick of you.

863
00:45:47,833 --> 00:45:49,333
Yeah, I get that. I get that.

864
00:45:49,416 --> 00:45:51,125
-I understand.
-What about you, Steve?

865
00:45:52,333 --> 00:45:54,000
Let's talk about you.

866
00:45:55,708 --> 00:45:57,666
Why do you fucking give a shit?

867
00:45:59,125 --> 00:46:00,125
You weirdo.

868
00:46:00,208 --> 00:46:01,791
-Shy.
-What are you anyway?

869
00:46:01,875 --> 00:46:04,083
Are you a fucking
alky or something?

870
00:46:12,666 --> 00:46:14,791
So, what we're doing
is we're asking everyone

871
00:46:14,875 --> 00:46:17,000
to describe themselves
in three words.

872
00:46:17,083 --> 00:46:18,125
Oh, okay.

873
00:46:19,500 --> 00:46:20,666
Um…

874
00:46:22,708 --> 00:46:24,791
Very, very tired.

875
00:46:28,583 --> 00:46:32,291
And, um,
what about the boys?

876
00:46:33,041 --> 00:46:34,750
What do they think of you?

877
00:46:34,833 --> 00:46:38,208
Cal, fucking do something!
Punch him in the fucking fanny!

878
00:46:39,250 --> 00:46:42,083
All right, gents. Sit down.
Boys, sit down, please.

879
00:46:42,166 --> 00:46:43,083
Um...

880
00:46:43,166 --> 00:46:46,875
Okay, so today has slipped out
of shape for various reasons…

881
00:46:46,958 --> 00:46:48,583
I think they
think I'm all right.

882
00:46:48,666 --> 00:46:50,625
Ash, are you good? Riley?

883
00:46:50,708 --> 00:46:54,083
I mean, I'm a dickhead, and a wanker,
and a tosser, and a knobhead, and…

884
00:46:54,166 --> 00:46:58,166
I could get 'em all arrested
for verbal abuse.

885
00:46:58,250 --> 00:47:00,333
And anti-Irish bigotry.

886
00:47:00,416 --> 00:47:04,833
But I think that they maybe…
I hope that they trust me.

887
00:47:04,916 --> 00:47:07,208
Remember I was talking
about the age of the planet?

888
00:47:07,291 --> 00:47:10,291
So, this line that I drew
here, lads, okay, so this,

889
00:47:10,375 --> 00:47:13,666
all the way is like the age of the
planet, all the way round, round, round.

890
00:47:13,750 --> 00:47:19,666
Right, all the way, all the way. Way,
way, way, way, way into town, yeah?

891
00:47:19,750 --> 00:47:22,875
You know, you get involved
in some explosive situations

892
00:47:22,958 --> 00:47:25,291
because the kids are
angry with each other,

893
00:47:25,375 --> 00:47:27,125
or they're angry
with authority, or…

894
00:47:27,208 --> 00:47:28,166
Over here…

895
00:47:28,250 --> 00:47:29,291
…their mum and dad.

896
00:47:29,375 --> 00:47:31,958
-This is humanity. Do you get it?
-Holy shit.

897
00:47:32,041 --> 00:47:33,541
So, that's what I'm trying to…

898
00:47:33,625 --> 00:47:35,958
People have bailed
on them for various reasons.

899
00:47:36,041 --> 00:47:39,250
So, all my staff are here
because they want to be here.

900
00:47:39,333 --> 00:47:41,416
You know? That's
what I'm trying to…

901
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,166
And I think that
that means something.

902
00:47:44,250 --> 00:47:46,500
-How old do we think these rocks are?
-Uh, wank.

903
00:47:47,666 --> 00:47:51,375
No, chalk, Jamie, chalk. Just
re... re... regular old chalk.

904
00:47:51,458 --> 00:47:52,541
-Anyone?
-Fifty mil!

905
00:47:52,625 --> 00:47:53,833
-No.
-Yeah, Benny. Yeah.

906
00:47:53,916 --> 00:47:55,125
-What?
-And, um…

907
00:47:56,833 --> 00:47:58,125
Um…

908
00:47:58,208 --> 00:48:01,625
Can anyone… Does anyone
know what chalk is made of?

909
00:48:02,666 --> 00:48:04,416
-Anyone?
-You're fucking stupid.

910
00:48:04,500 --> 00:48:06,000
-Shut up, man.
-Shut up.

911
00:48:06,083 --> 00:48:08,625
Billions of little
crushed up, like…

912
00:48:08,708 --> 00:48:11,833
-What, Shy?
-Billions of little crushed up…

913
00:48:11,916 --> 00:48:14,375
-Yes, that's it.
-No, I don't know.

914
00:48:14,458 --> 00:48:15,416
No, you got it.

915
00:48:15,500 --> 00:48:16,833
No, I don't know.

916
00:48:16,916 --> 00:48:17,958
You got it.

917
00:48:23,625 --> 00:48:27,416
So, it's like millions and billions of
crushed up little fossils, basically.

918
00:48:27,500 --> 00:48:30,250
Like, uh, like little seashells…

919
00:48:30,333 --> 00:48:32,916
If your teachers could
describe you in three words,

920
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:34,708
what do you think they'd say?

921
00:48:35,875 --> 00:48:39,083
That's what I'm saying. One day to
the next would be mad different.

922
00:48:39,166 --> 00:48:45,208
Like, some days, they'd say
chatty, clever, chilled.

923
00:48:45,291 --> 00:48:48,500
And then, the next day, say…

924
00:48:50,083 --> 00:48:54,333
Miserable and disruptive, pissy.

925
00:48:55,375 --> 00:48:58,166
You seem like someone
very emotionally intelligent,

926
00:48:58,250 --> 00:48:59,791
if you don't mind me saying.

927
00:49:00,541 --> 00:49:05,000
I know. It's like looking at the night sky
and trying to hold it all in your head.

928
00:49:05,083 --> 00:49:08,000
-All right, don't cry, Steve.
-What?

929
00:49:08,083 --> 00:49:10,833
You've seen it. I
mean, it's chaotic, right?

930
00:49:11,791 --> 00:49:13,708
But we… we think it's working.

931
00:49:13,791 --> 00:49:16,041
You can lock these kids
up and throw away the key,

932
00:49:17,125 --> 00:49:19,166
but we feel we're
doing something.

933
00:49:19,250 --> 00:49:20,750
There's an alternative.

934
00:49:26,958 --> 00:49:29,750
-Fuck off!
-Prick! Come here, you dickhead.

935
00:49:51,166 --> 00:49:52,666
Fire!

936
00:49:52,750 --> 00:49:55,416
Steve! Steve!

937
00:49:55,500 --> 00:49:56,500
Fire!

938
00:50:19,041 --> 00:50:20,458
Steve, who pulled it?

939
00:50:21,541 --> 00:50:22,708
It was pulled.

940
00:50:46,166 --> 00:50:49,541
Uh, can you describe
your colleagues in three words?

941
00:50:51,250 --> 00:50:54,041
Love it. Um… Off the record?

942
00:50:54,125 --> 00:50:57,916
Yeah, yeah, totally.
It's just for fun and therapy.

943
00:50:58,000 --> 00:50:59,000
Okay.

944
00:50:59,625 --> 00:51:01,541
Steve…

945
00:51:02,458 --> 00:51:04,833
Steve is…

946
00:51:06,541 --> 00:51:07,875
Proper.

947
00:51:15,125 --> 00:51:17,250
He's one of the
good guys, you know?

948
00:51:19,250 --> 00:51:20,708
He's authentic.

949
00:51:24,875 --> 00:51:26,875
Yeah. He's the boss.

950
00:51:42,291 --> 00:51:43,291
I get it.

951
00:51:44,541 --> 00:51:45,541
Okay?

952
00:51:46,875 --> 00:51:48,916
I hate class, yeah?

953
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:50,791
I've been mad stressed out.

954
00:51:50,875 --> 00:51:54,208
Missing out on pool table privileges
basically ruined my fucking life!

955
00:51:54,291 --> 00:51:55,625
I miss drugs. I miss pussy.

956
00:51:55,708 --> 00:51:58,041
-I wish I was out of fucking school!
-Okay, thank you.

957
00:52:02,583 --> 00:52:03,583
Oi.

958
00:52:04,875 --> 00:52:08,125
You know, you might
actually like this, Jenny.

959
00:52:10,041 --> 00:52:12,125
I was chatting to Jungle Bunny.

960
00:52:12,208 --> 00:52:14,208
-Shy.
-Yeah.

961
00:52:16,791 --> 00:52:21,000
And he was saying how our mums
always used to be up in our shit.

962
00:52:21,916 --> 00:52:22,916
You know?

963
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:25,333
Hassling us.

964
00:52:26,500 --> 00:52:29,000
"Stop this. Stop that."

965
00:52:29,541 --> 00:52:31,458
"Don't do this. Don't do that."

966
00:52:32,541 --> 00:52:34,208
"You've ruined this family."

967
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:44,083
And he said to me,
"Bro, I miss that."

968
00:52:48,875 --> 00:52:50,375
I told him, "Look, I'm…"

969
00:52:52,666 --> 00:52:55,875
"I miss that too,
innit. I miss her."

970
00:53:00,875 --> 00:53:03,416
Ah, my mum.

971
00:53:09,125 --> 00:53:10,666
I ruined her life, innit?

972
00:53:13,750 --> 00:53:16,500
But there it is, Jenny.

973
00:53:17,166 --> 00:53:18,250
There you go.

974
00:53:20,708 --> 00:53:23,458
Jenny. Jenny penny menny.

975
00:53:23,541 --> 00:53:27,083
Take that, put it in your
pipe, and fucking smoke it.

976
00:53:31,250 --> 00:53:35,291
It's pretty much exactly what I
said to Tarone this afternoon.

977
00:53:35,375 --> 00:53:36,833
In a normal school…

978
00:53:36,916 --> 00:53:38,791
He'd be arrested,
sorry to be blunt.

979
00:53:38,875 --> 00:53:41,541
Well, quite. It's what I've
been trying to say to you.

980
00:53:43,083 --> 00:53:44,875
But from Shola's point
of view, we've...

981
00:53:44,958 --> 00:53:46,958
When I say "we," I mean you,

982
00:53:47,041 --> 00:53:51,291
the school, have been remiss to
the point of negligence in not…

983
00:53:51,375 --> 00:53:53,125
Sorry. Sorry, Jenny.

984
00:53:53,666 --> 00:53:56,375
Is the bloody film
crew hiding in here?

985
00:53:56,458 --> 00:53:57,916
I think they're done.

986
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:00,625
-God, they've been everywhere.
-Hope so.

987
00:54:00,708 --> 00:54:03,166
Hello, Steve. Quite the
day you've all been having.

988
00:54:03,250 --> 00:54:04,375
Yes. Yeah.

989
00:54:04,458 --> 00:54:07,541
Shy narrowly escaped getting
carted off to the Tower of London

990
00:54:07,625 --> 00:54:09,958
for verbally assaulting
a lord, or a sir.

991
00:54:10,041 --> 00:54:11,708
Is he a sir? He's a sir.

992
00:54:11,791 --> 00:54:14,042
-Ugh. Yeah, Amanda was telling me.
-Fucking hell.

993
00:54:14,125 --> 00:54:17,250
I've never disliked a person
as much in my entire life.

994
00:54:17,333 --> 00:54:19,000
And the timing, you know.

995
00:54:19,083 --> 00:54:22,666
Poor old Shy. He's up, he's down,
and then bam, he's a comedy genius.

996
00:54:22,750 --> 00:54:24,666
Yeah, I really
want to discuss that.

997
00:54:25,666 --> 00:54:27,625
Or, Steve, do you want to, um…

998
00:54:28,916 --> 00:54:30,041
No, you go. You go.

999
00:54:31,875 --> 00:54:34,916
All right. Um, well, I had…

1000
00:54:35,791 --> 00:54:39,708
I had a disastrous session
with him this afternoon. A…

1001
00:54:39,791 --> 00:54:44,541
He attacked a chair, but I think I
need to go back further than that

1002
00:54:44,625 --> 00:54:48,333
to last Thursday, or
even the Thursday before.

1003
00:54:48,416 --> 00:54:53,458
I have noticed a distinct
change in his receptiveness

1004
00:54:53,541 --> 00:54:56,750
to the things that we do
here week in, week out.

1005
00:54:56,833 --> 00:54:59,958
He's completely
stopped his diary.

1006
00:55:00,041 --> 00:55:03,666
He's completely stopped his
morning sentences, his breathing.

1007
00:55:03,750 --> 00:55:06,125
He says it's all pointless.

1008
00:55:06,208 --> 00:55:09,833
And he's previously been so
eloquent about his night terrors

1009
00:55:09,916 --> 00:55:11,083
and his…

1010
00:55:12,083 --> 00:55:13,583
His barbed wire feeling.

1011
00:55:13,666 --> 00:55:15,083
And just in the last month...

1012
00:55:15,166 --> 00:55:18,083
Yeah, it feels like he's
backed out of the room.

1013
00:55:18,166 --> 00:55:19,833
Yeah, Steve, he has.

1014
00:55:19,916 --> 00:55:21,458
-And I'm worried.
-Yeah.

1015
00:55:21,541 --> 00:55:24,166
I mean, I think things
are okay within the group.

1016
00:55:24,250 --> 00:55:27,250
-You know, the drum and bass crew. Yeah?
-Yeah, they seem to be.

1017
00:55:27,333 --> 00:55:28,833
Oh, no.

1018
00:55:28,916 --> 00:55:31,125
It's pissing down,
look at that. Oh!

1019
00:55:31,208 --> 00:55:34,750
Yeah, he's… He takes
things to heart, but he's…

1020
00:55:34,833 --> 00:55:37,583
I mean, him and Benny are
fine, him and Cal are fine.

1021
00:55:37,666 --> 00:55:40,500
You know, I mean, he's been quiet.

1022
00:55:40,583 --> 00:55:42,500
Yeah, um… he, um…

1023
00:55:43,375 --> 00:55:44,416
He, um…

1024
00:55:44,500 --> 00:55:47,875
I asked if his folks would want
to come up for the weekend,

1025
00:55:47,958 --> 00:55:49,750
and he reacted
very badly to that.

1026
00:55:49,833 --> 00:55:53,250
But he's been very, very quiet,
mostly. Up until Cuntgate.

1027
00:55:53,333 --> 00:55:54,500
Ooh.

1028
00:55:54,583 --> 00:55:57,708
You know, I know you
adopt an out-of-sight policy here.

1029
00:55:57,791 --> 00:55:59,083
I'm talking about marijuana.

1030
00:55:59,166 --> 00:56:01,625
Bloody hell, I wouldn't
go that far. We do our best.

1031
00:56:01,708 --> 00:56:04,708
-Most boys are social users.
-We've got to pick our battles.

1032
00:56:04,791 --> 00:56:07,125
But I think Shy would
rather smoke alone.

1033
00:56:07,208 --> 00:56:10,041
We can confirm on the
weed. Me and Owen can do better.

1034
00:56:10,125 --> 00:56:14,958
We're on it, um… But it's always
been a tricky aspect of this site.

1035
00:56:18,250 --> 00:56:20,958
Yeah, he has a genuine desire.

1036
00:56:21,041 --> 00:56:23,625
You know, and I really
fucking feel for him.

1037
00:56:23,708 --> 00:56:26,875
He has a genuine desire
to clamber out of himself.

1038
00:56:26,958 --> 00:56:29,041
Owen, a fucking handball!

1039
00:56:29,625 --> 00:56:30,625
Look, I'm…

1040
00:56:32,083 --> 00:56:35,208
I promise I'm not criticizing
anybody personally here, but…

1041
00:56:36,166 --> 00:56:38,875
I've never felt like this
at Stanton Wood before.

1042
00:56:40,458 --> 00:56:44,750
I asked to speak to you
about Shy two weeks ago,

1043
00:56:44,833 --> 00:56:47,666
and I asked you again
twice this week.

1044
00:56:52,041 --> 00:56:55,250
That is your
basic, basic duty of care.

1045
00:56:55,333 --> 00:56:57,000
Jenny, it's
been a bit mental.

1046
00:56:57,083 --> 00:57:01,000
You know that I adore coming here,
and I respect what you all do so much,

1047
00:57:01,083 --> 00:57:03,041
but Steve, you can't do it all.

1048
00:57:03,125 --> 00:57:05,291
And with someone like Shy…

1049
00:57:05,375 --> 00:57:08,250
Why don't you just
magic up some more staff, Jenny?

1050
00:57:08,333 --> 00:57:11,291
Look, I'm not casting
aspersions, but Steve…

1051
00:57:14,375 --> 00:57:16,000
Perhaps there's a
limit to what you...

1052
00:57:16,083 --> 00:57:18,250
I'll stop you there
before you offend anyone.

1053
00:57:20,083 --> 00:57:21,708
It's over anyway.

1054
00:57:22,291 --> 00:57:24,916
What do you mean,
"It's over," Amanda?

1055
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:26,875
They're
closing the school.

1056
00:57:41,583 --> 00:57:43,916
I want to be here,
like, at Stanton Wood,

1057
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:46,166
but sometimes I just want
to be four years old, and…

1058
00:57:48,250 --> 00:57:50,041
Start again and not fuck it up.

1059
00:57:51,541 --> 00:57:53,875
Have another run at
it, but not in my head.

1060
00:57:55,333 --> 00:57:56,833
Not fuck so much stuff up,

1061
00:57:56,916 --> 00:57:59,708
not feel like all the
things I fuck up are on me.

1062
00:58:00,750 --> 00:58:02,625
Like, stuck to me.

1063
00:58:09,583 --> 00:58:10,750
What about you, Steve?

1064
00:58:10,833 --> 00:58:13,416
Let's talk about you. Why
do you fucking give a shit?

1065
00:58:13,500 --> 00:58:15,125
-Shy.
-What are you anyway?

1066
00:58:15,208 --> 00:58:17,458
Are you a fucking
alky or something?

1067
00:58:19,958 --> 00:58:22,583
It's over. No
more phone calls or visits.

1068
00:58:23,291 --> 00:58:25,666
You can't pause contact
with me. I'm your son.

1069
00:58:25,750 --> 00:58:27,500
Shut up and listen.

1070
00:58:41,166 --> 00:58:42,958
This is
your fault, Steve.

1071
00:58:44,041 --> 00:58:45,333
This is your fault.

1072
00:59:10,583 --> 00:59:14,625
I've gotta get on with stuff. I'll
see you soon, Jenny, all right?

1073
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:39,041
Steve.

1074
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:47,083
I'm sorry.

1075
01:00:01,791 --> 01:00:03,000
It's okay.

1076
01:00:07,750 --> 01:00:09,166
-You okay?
-Yeah.

1077
01:00:10,208 --> 01:00:12,291
Yeah, it's good. It's good.

1078
01:00:14,375 --> 01:00:15,666
-Bye.
-Okay.

1079
01:01:04,291 --> 01:01:06,458
Fuck off!

1080
01:01:06,541 --> 01:01:08,000
Fuck off!

1081
01:01:11,083 --> 01:01:14,041
You're all good?
You're okay, Shola?

1082
01:01:14,125 --> 01:01:16,958
Yeah.
Yeah, I'm all good.

1083
01:01:17,041 --> 01:01:20,833
Okay. Um, Amanda, can you
undersign this, please?

1084
01:01:20,916 --> 01:01:23,500
Okay. Yep.

1085
01:01:27,666 --> 01:01:30,250
There wasn't any shit
during the football?

1086
01:01:30,333 --> 01:01:31,333
No.

1087
01:01:32,416 --> 01:01:35,166
Yeah, I think I kinda
schooled them, to be honest.

1088
01:01:36,083 --> 01:01:37,416
Unless I'm being naive,

1089
01:01:37,500 --> 01:01:41,625
but everyone was pretty well-behaved,
and Tarone hasn't uttered a word to me.

1090
01:01:41,708 --> 01:01:45,291
All right, I'm gonna go and
do the rounds and smoke a roll-up.

1091
01:01:45,375 --> 01:01:46,500
Right. Yep.

1092
01:01:47,708 --> 01:01:49,791
Yeah.

1093
01:01:49,875 --> 01:01:51,750
As a great poet said,

1094
01:01:51,833 --> 01:01:55,416
"We must smoke while we still
have mouths to puff with."

1095
01:01:56,333 --> 01:01:57,541
Oh, Shola. Shola?

1096
01:01:57,625 --> 01:02:00,708
Can you just hang on for a minute?
Maybe we can have that chat?

1097
01:02:01,958 --> 01:02:02,916
Right now?

1098
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:04,666
If that's okay, yeah.

1099
01:02:06,541 --> 01:02:07,375
'Course.

1100
01:02:07,458 --> 01:02:09,666
Yeah, come into my
office.

1101
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:17,708
What a fucking day.

1102
01:02:19,166 --> 01:02:24,083
Yeah, well, up until that
whole chicken Kiev war zone,

1103
01:02:24,166 --> 01:02:27,500
it was all going so well. It
was a pretty chill day, I think.

1104
01:02:30,916 --> 01:02:33,750
Um, right, so…
first things first.

1105
01:02:33,833 --> 01:02:38,625
Yeah. So, these… uh, stupid tapes,
I know they're really silly,

1106
01:02:38,708 --> 01:02:42,541
but we didn't have time for a
briefing, so that's why I'm doing them.

1107
01:02:44,083 --> 01:02:45,666
They're… They're great, Steve.

1108
01:02:45,750 --> 01:02:47,291
-Really?
-Yeah.

1109
01:02:47,375 --> 01:02:51,375
Shola says she actually
likes the tapes, Steve.

1110
01:02:53,458 --> 01:02:56,666
Shola says
she actually likes the tapes, Steve.

1111
01:02:58,166 --> 01:03:02,083
Good, and the rota... the rota...
Is your... is your rota better?

1112
01:03:02,166 --> 01:03:05,916
Yeah. I'm loving the
new days, so thank you.

1113
01:03:09,875 --> 01:03:11,208
I know…

1114
01:03:13,375 --> 01:03:16,250
I know Amanda doesn't think I'm…

1115
01:03:17,458 --> 01:03:19,791
Up for this, or ready, or...

1116
01:03:19,875 --> 01:03:21,416
What do you mean, "up for it"?

1117
01:03:22,791 --> 01:03:26,291
Uh, this, the
teaching, this place.

1118
01:03:26,375 --> 01:03:29,125
No, that's not
it. That's not it.

1119
01:03:30,375 --> 01:03:32,541
I mean, she literally said that.

1120
01:03:32,625 --> 01:03:33,916
No, Amanda…

1121
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:37,083
Amanda, she'll say shit if
she's stressed, you know.

1122
01:03:37,166 --> 01:03:39,250
Like, none of us are
fucking…

1123
01:03:39,333 --> 01:03:43,083
None of us are, like, paid enough
or trained enough or good enough.

1124
01:03:43,166 --> 01:03:45,625
None of us are. So, don't…

1125
01:03:45,708 --> 01:03:48,125
That's not enough...
That's, like, not reason to…

1126
01:03:50,291 --> 01:03:52,333
-You can't just jack it in.
-Mm.

1127
01:03:52,416 --> 01:03:53,750
It's all fucked.

1128
01:03:58,875 --> 01:04:00,375
Yeah, it's just, I'm…

1129
01:04:01,291 --> 01:04:04,333
I really want to be
here, Steve. I'm…

1130
01:04:04,875 --> 01:04:07,291
I'm really good at this.

1131
01:04:07,375 --> 01:04:08,708
You really are, Shola.

1132
01:04:08,791 --> 01:04:12,625
Just the whole Tarone situation,
it was just bad timing.

1133
01:04:12,708 --> 01:04:16,166
And I feel like if I was
here maybe a year ago,

1134
01:04:16,250 --> 01:04:17,750
I'd have handled it differently.

1135
01:04:17,833 --> 01:04:19,291
And look, if I…

1136
01:04:19,375 --> 01:04:22,166
I feel like I wasn't
on that quick enough.

1137
01:04:22,250 --> 01:04:26,708
And I... And if you felt
unsupported or… alone at any point,

1138
01:04:26,791 --> 01:04:29,833
I truly, truly am sorry.

1139
01:04:31,083 --> 01:04:33,875
Damn it, Steve,
gonna make me cry.

1140
01:04:36,458 --> 01:04:40,250
It's all good. It's a
massive learning curve.

1141
01:04:40,333 --> 01:04:44,041
Well, we're really
lucky to have you. I mean that.

1142
01:04:44,125 --> 01:04:45,125
Thank you.

1143
01:04:48,708 --> 01:04:50,333
Uh…

1144
01:04:50,416 --> 01:04:53,750
Something else I'd like
to ask, if that's okay.

1145
01:04:53,833 --> 01:04:55,916
Oh, maybe you don't know or…

1146
01:04:57,625 --> 01:04:59,166
What the fuck?

1147
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:01,125
December?

1148
01:05:01,208 --> 01:05:02,083
Yeah.

1149
01:05:02,166 --> 01:05:05,166
Like, what does…
what does that mean exactly?

1150
01:05:05,250 --> 01:05:09,791
-Do we have to start looking for jobs or…?
-I don't know. I don't know, Shola.

1151
01:05:14,083 --> 01:05:15,125
I don't…

1152
01:05:17,833 --> 01:05:19,250
I dunno, I dunno.

1153
01:05:26,916 --> 01:05:28,208
Um…

1154
01:05:29,458 --> 01:05:32,000
Well, at least…

1155
01:05:33,708 --> 01:05:35,458
At least we met an MP.

1156
01:05:36,583 --> 01:05:38,791
-A real-life MP.
-Yeah.

1157
01:05:38,875 --> 01:05:42,208
That was, um, a true honor.

1158
01:05:42,291 --> 01:05:43,833
A real-life MP.

1159
01:05:51,291 --> 01:05:54,416
W... Was there
anything else you…

1160
01:05:55,458 --> 01:05:57,583
-No.
-No, okay. Um…

1161
01:05:58,375 --> 01:05:59,833
-Cool. Well…
-Cool.

1162
01:05:59,916 --> 01:06:02,000
I'm off. I'll see
you bright and early?

1163
01:06:02,083 --> 01:06:03,166
Yeah. See you.

1164
01:06:03,250 --> 01:06:04,166
You overnight?

1165
01:06:04,250 --> 01:06:06,541
Yeah, me and Amanda
and Owen. Yeah.

1166
01:06:06,625 --> 01:06:09,500
-Cool. Okay, get some rest. I'll see you.
-All good, yep.

1167
01:06:17,583 --> 01:06:22,000
Okay. Um, call, um,
Shy's mum and stepdad,

1168
01:06:22,083 --> 01:06:25,708
and, uh… note to
file, full disclosure

1169
01:06:25,791 --> 01:06:29,625
on his behavior…
…and our concerns.

1170
01:06:29,708 --> 01:06:30,750
Um…

1171
01:06:31,375 --> 01:06:36,291
A full written report from Jenny
and full mea culpa from me, um…

1172
01:06:37,375 --> 01:06:39,916
Reset on the meds with the GP.

1173
01:06:40,708 --> 01:06:45,500
T-t-try and sort out the
fucking rooms with, uh…

1174
01:06:45,583 --> 01:06:48,000
And just
fucking deal with it, Steven.

1175
01:06:51,166 --> 01:06:53,208
You're fucking, fucking heading

1176
01:06:53,291 --> 01:06:56,250
on this fucking stupid,
fucking roundabout of doom.

1177
01:06:56,833 --> 01:06:57,833
You f…

1178
01:07:00,041 --> 01:07:02,125
They're closing
your school, Steven.

1179
01:07:04,333 --> 01:07:06,125
…Steven.

1180
01:07:07,250 --> 01:07:10,708
…fucking heading on this fucking
stupid, fucking roundabout of doom.

1181
01:07:12,208 --> 01:07:14,333
They're closing
your school, Steven.

1182
01:07:16,791 --> 01:07:18,458
They're closing
your school, Steven.

1183
01:07:20,375 --> 01:07:21,375
…Steven.

1184
01:08:11,083 --> 01:08:12,458
You working hard?

1185
01:08:12,541 --> 01:08:14,416
Ha.

1186
01:08:16,583 --> 01:08:18,625
-You... You're drinking?
-Yep.

1187
01:08:18,708 --> 01:08:20,375
-You're drinking?
-Yep.

1188
01:08:20,458 --> 01:08:22,250
Just having a glass of wine.

1189
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:25,583
It's not a big deal. Having
a... There's loads over there.

1190
01:08:25,666 --> 01:08:28,416
It's the Christmas red. You
should have a glass, Amanda.

1191
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:36,750
-Have you taken something?
-No!

1192
01:08:36,833 --> 01:08:40,041
-Ha!
-No, Amanda. Come on. Just leave me…

1193
01:08:41,041 --> 01:08:43,583
Like, I'm just
having a glass of wine.

1194
01:08:44,375 --> 01:08:47,416
Really. I'm just having a glass
of wine. You should have a glass.

1195
01:08:54,916 --> 01:08:57,083
You know, none of
this is your fault.

1196
01:09:01,291 --> 01:09:02,875
-Mm.
-Steve.

1197
01:09:05,583 --> 01:09:06,666
Yeah, but it is.

1198
01:09:06,750 --> 01:09:07,916
No, it's not.

1199
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:09,958
-But it is.
-No, it's not!

1200
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:15,666
Steven, it's not your fault.

1201
01:09:16,333 --> 01:09:19,416
The school closing,
not your fault.

1202
01:09:23,708 --> 01:09:25,083
The car crash.

1203
01:09:26,666 --> 01:09:29,000
-The little girl dying.
-Oh, please, please, please.

1204
01:09:29,083 --> 01:09:30,791
-No. I mean, look, I'm…
-Please.

1205
01:09:30,875 --> 01:09:34,000
-Why don't you talk about it?
-No, no, Amanda, I'm not doing this now.

1206
01:09:34,083 --> 01:09:36,916
-Somebody died, and if you're numbing…
-I'm not doing this now.

1207
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:38,916
-Here's to you too. Come on.
-No, no.

1208
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:40,708
-Take your gla...
-No, no.

1209
01:09:40,791 --> 01:09:42,500
I want you to talk about it.

1210
01:09:42,583 --> 01:09:46,083
I want you to say it's not your
fault. I want you to acknowledge it.

1211
01:09:46,166 --> 01:09:49,250
I want you to look at
me and acknowledge it!

1212
01:09:51,791 --> 01:09:55,291
'Cause you're in agony, mate.
You're in fucking agony!

1213
01:09:55,375 --> 01:09:57,875
You really are, and
you can't numb it,

1214
01:09:57,958 --> 01:09:59,375
and you can't stop it

1215
01:09:59,458 --> 01:10:02,583
'cause you don't fucking
deal with it, Steve!

1216
01:10:02,666 --> 01:10:05,416
You don't fucking deal with it!

1217
01:10:11,166 --> 01:10:14,916
Me and Steve, you know, we expected
something quite different here.

1218
01:10:15,875 --> 01:10:18,375
Two full year groups,
you know, 60-odd kids,

1219
01:10:18,458 --> 01:10:19,916
and almost as many teachers.

1220
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:23,708
And it was supposed to be
this center of excellence.

1221
01:10:24,583 --> 01:10:27,875
And cut after cut, and we
are down to the bare bones,

1222
01:10:27,958 --> 01:10:30,041
and we're just limping along

1223
01:10:30,125 --> 01:10:33,583
in a sort of
permanent crisis mode.

1224
01:10:33,666 --> 01:10:34,583
And…

1225
01:10:36,250 --> 01:10:39,666
Steve feels bad about it,
and he shouldn't, you know?

1226
01:10:39,750 --> 01:10:40,708
Um…

1227
01:10:40,791 --> 01:10:43,583
And I get it 'cause I feel
bad about it, and I shouldn't,

1228
01:10:43,666 --> 01:10:46,541
but I think that's why we work,
because both of us, you know,

1229
01:10:46,625 --> 01:10:50,000
we're really locked into this
place for better or worse,

1230
01:10:50,083 --> 01:10:52,166
and it's almost always worse.

1231
01:11:05,333 --> 01:11:11,458
♪ I see ♪

1232
01:11:12,041 --> 01:11:17,958
♪ Unseen ♪

1233
01:11:18,041 --> 01:11:24,166
♪ I feel ♪

1234
01:11:24,833 --> 01:11:30,875
♪ Unseen ♪

1235
01:14:43,166 --> 01:14:44,583
Fucking…

1236
01:15:44,500 --> 01:15:47,625
Just
actually fuck off, Steve.

1237
01:15:48,708 --> 01:15:52,250
Dude, I don't want to
talk. I am sick of talking.

1238
01:15:54,916 --> 01:15:56,541
I'm sick of Jenny.

1239
01:16:00,333 --> 01:16:02,291
What about you, Steve?

1240
01:16:04,583 --> 01:16:06,708
Why do you fucking give a shit?

1241
01:16:41,166 --> 01:16:42,708
Oh, no, no.

1242
01:16:45,083 --> 01:16:46,083
No, no.

1243
01:16:46,875 --> 01:16:47,916
Oh, no!

1244
01:16:48,541 --> 01:16:49,750
No, no, no.

1245
01:16:50,375 --> 01:16:52,750
-Amanda. Amanda!
-What?

1246
01:16:52,833 --> 01:16:54,125
-Amanda, Shy's gone.
-What's that?

1247
01:16:54,208 --> 01:16:55,208
-Shy's gone.
-What?

1248
01:16:55,291 --> 01:16:56,416
Shy's gone. He left a note.

1249
01:16:56,500 --> 01:16:58,000
-What?
-Don't wake up the boys.

1250
01:16:58,083 --> 01:17:00,291
-He's not there, he's gone!
-What are we gonna...

1251
01:17:00,375 --> 01:17:02,916
-Come on, we gotta go find him. But he's...
-It's okay.

1252
01:17:03,458 --> 01:17:06,708
What the fuck have you done? You've
taken something, haven't you?

1253
01:17:06,791 --> 01:17:09,416
-What have you taken?
-I just had a few glasses of wine.

1254
01:17:09,500 --> 01:17:12,750
You lied to me. You lied
to me, you weak, stupid…

1255
01:17:12,833 --> 01:17:15,250
Fucking lied to me.
You fucking find him.

1256
01:17:15,333 --> 01:17:16,333
You fucking lied.

1257
01:17:20,291 --> 01:17:21,625
Shy!

1258
01:17:25,750 --> 01:17:26,875
Shy!

1259
01:17:32,291 --> 01:17:33,375
Shy!

1260
01:17:36,333 --> 01:17:37,333
Shy?

1261
01:17:37,791 --> 01:17:39,375
-Shy!
-Shy.

1262
01:17:40,416 --> 01:17:41,625
Shy!

1263
01:17:44,375 --> 01:17:45,541
Shy?

1264
01:17:51,583 --> 01:17:52,583
Shy!

1265
01:17:54,666 --> 01:17:55,875
Shy!

1266
01:17:57,041 --> 01:17:58,208
Shy.

1267
01:17:58,291 --> 01:17:59,375
Shy!

1268
01:18:02,208 --> 01:18:03,208
Shy!

1269
01:18:09,791 --> 01:18:11,750
-I'm going to call the police.
-No, no, no.

1270
01:18:11,833 --> 01:18:15,000
Check the attic, check the cellar.
I'm gonna look around here.

1271
01:18:17,333 --> 01:18:18,333
Shy!

1272
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:22,000
Shy!

1273
01:18:28,333 --> 01:18:29,458
Shy!

1274
01:18:32,875 --> 01:18:34,125
Shy!

1275
01:18:37,875 --> 01:18:38,958
Shy!

1276
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:43,541
Shy!

1277
01:19:27,416 --> 01:19:28,875
If I could go back…

1278
01:19:29,791 --> 01:19:31,166
Uh…

1279
01:19:32,541 --> 01:19:34,250
I'd just…

1280
01:19:34,333 --> 01:19:39,000
I would go to my nana's
house and just… spend time.

1281
01:19:42,375 --> 01:19:43,916
I would sit…

1282
01:19:45,541 --> 01:19:47,416
In my nana's house.

1283
01:19:51,208 --> 01:19:54,000
And just listen to her…

1284
01:19:55,291 --> 01:19:56,458
Chatting.

1285
01:19:56,958 --> 01:19:59,666
Just smell her house.

1286
01:20:02,708 --> 01:20:05,041
Eat her soft, manky
Bourbon biscuits.

1287
01:20:05,125 --> 01:20:06,125
Just…

1288
01:20:18,833 --> 01:20:21,416
I would just maybe
pack it all up and…

1289
01:20:23,166 --> 01:20:26,583
Pack it into a caravan, take
it out on the road. You know?

1290
01:20:26,666 --> 01:20:29,000
Thelma and Louise-style
geography class.

1291
01:20:29,958 --> 01:20:32,083
Full speed into the abyss.

1292
01:21:07,541 --> 01:21:09,041
Dad! Daddy!

1293
01:21:09,125 --> 01:21:10,583
-Hi, there! Hi, there!
-Daddy!

1294
01:21:10,666 --> 01:21:11,583
-Dad!
-Daddy!

1295
01:21:11,666 --> 01:21:13,291
How are we?
How is everyone?

1296
01:21:13,375 --> 01:21:14,541
Daddy.

1297
01:21:14,625 --> 01:21:15,833
-Dad.
-Yeah.

1298
01:21:15,916 --> 01:21:17,083
-Dad!
-You're so muddy.

1299
01:21:17,166 --> 01:21:19,041
-I know. So muddy.
-Why are you muddy?

1300
01:21:19,125 --> 01:21:20,458
It looks quite yucky.

1301
01:21:20,541 --> 01:21:21,541
Yuck.

1302
01:21:22,166 --> 01:21:23,625
-Come on, girls.
-Thanks, Mum.

1303
01:21:23,708 --> 01:21:24,833
We've got muffins today!

1304
01:21:24,916 --> 01:21:27,083
-Christ, Dad looks fresh.
-We've got muffins.

1305
01:21:27,166 --> 01:21:29,583
-Morning.
-Late one? Tricky one? Fire? Murder?

1306
01:21:29,666 --> 01:21:31,291
-Everyone okay?
-All good.

1307
01:21:31,375 --> 01:21:32,833
How come you're muddy?

1308
01:21:32,916 --> 01:21:35,250
Oh, it's just… It's fine.

1309
01:21:35,333 --> 01:21:36,916
-Everyone okay?
-Yeah.

1310
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:38,875
-One of those?
-Yeah, one of those.

1311
01:21:38,958 --> 01:21:41,625
-Come on. We're gonna be late.
-Come on, girls. Let's go.

1312
01:21:41,708 --> 01:21:45,458
Remember, be good, be kind, be clever,
be brilliant at everything, especially…

1313
01:21:45,541 --> 01:21:46,833
-Running.
-No, especially…

1314
01:21:46,916 --> 01:21:47,916
Very special painting.

1315
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:51,083
No, especially science,
yeah? And inventions.

1316
01:21:51,750 --> 01:21:53,416
Sleep. Sleep all
day. Do nothing.

1317
01:21:53,500 --> 01:21:55,333
-Then cook for us, okay?
-I will. Okay.

1318
01:21:55,416 --> 01:21:56,333
-Love you.
-Love you.

1319
01:21:56,416 --> 01:21:59,666
Now, let's go. Come on, girls.
We're gonna be late. Let's go!

1320
01:21:59,750 --> 01:22:01,458
-Let's go.
-Bye, Daddy!

1321
01:22:01,541 --> 01:22:04,166
-We haven't got science.
-Chop-chop. Your rucksack strap.

1322
01:22:44,291 --> 01:22:46,708
All
right, so, Shola, it's Steve.

1323
01:22:46,791 --> 01:22:49,250
You already know that,
so blah, blah, blah.

1324
01:22:49,333 --> 01:22:52,625
Um, look, ignore this or
listen to it as you please.

1325
01:22:52,708 --> 01:22:57,500
There's absolutely no pressure from me.
So, Ash. Right, you'll... you'll love Ash.

1326
01:22:57,583 --> 01:23:00,083
He's one of those kids
who's all chip and grift,

1327
01:23:00,166 --> 01:23:02,625
and he'd, like, nick
the shirt off your back.

1328
01:23:02,708 --> 01:23:07,791
He's a proper fucking scally,
but he's so smart and funny.

1329
01:23:08,500 --> 01:23:10,166
And he's just great craic.

1330
01:23:11,041 --> 01:23:14,375
Benny. Benny's got a big
presence in the house.

1331
01:23:14,458 --> 01:23:18,000
Sometimes he's more… kind of more
like the staff than a student.

1332
01:23:18,083 --> 01:23:20,625
And you need Benny on
your side in a crisis

1333
01:23:20,708 --> 01:23:22,583
'cause he can sort
stuff, you know?

1334
01:23:22,666 --> 01:23:26,208
He lost his dad a while ago,
and he never got to say goodbye.

1335
01:23:26,291 --> 01:23:27,583
I think his dad was inside.

1336
01:23:27,666 --> 01:23:31,541
So, in there, there's just
a grieving kid, you know?

1337
01:23:31,625 --> 01:23:35,291
Riley, oh, man,
this kid. This kid.

1338
01:23:35,375 --> 01:23:39,541
Riley is powered by a different
kind of engine than the rest of us.

1339
01:23:39,625 --> 01:23:44,208
He is a fascinating, beautiful
kid, and he's… he's relentless.

1340
01:23:44,291 --> 01:23:47,583
He's fighting all the time with
himself or with the others.

1341
01:23:47,666 --> 01:23:49,791
He's got this kind
of mad momentum.

1342
01:23:49,875 --> 01:23:52,833
It's attack, attack, attack
all the time. He's always on.

1343
01:23:52,916 --> 01:23:54,416
He's like the wild
boy, you know?

1344
01:23:54,500 --> 01:23:57,500
Encyclopedic knowledge.
Cornish and proud. So clever.

1345
01:23:57,583 --> 01:24:01,041
Nabeel. You're gonna
love Nabeel, Shola.

1346
01:24:01,125 --> 01:24:03,833
He's Mr. Cool, Mr. Smooth.

1347
01:24:03,916 --> 01:24:06,541
And he's very strong
academically when he tries.

1348
01:24:07,250 --> 01:24:10,458
Jamie. I earn my fucking
salary on Jamie alone.

1349
01:24:10,541 --> 01:24:12,166
If there's a fight,
he started it.

1350
01:24:12,250 --> 01:24:15,375
If there's a weakness, he'll
find it. But I adore him.

1351
01:24:15,458 --> 01:24:18,125
He's very insightful and
wise, and he can read people.

1352
01:24:18,208 --> 01:24:19,958
That's how he pushes
their buttons.

1353
01:24:20,041 --> 01:24:23,500
I'd like him to knuckle down, obviously.
He could get very good results.

1354
01:24:23,583 --> 01:24:26,083
He talks about business
studies or something like that.

1355
01:24:26,166 --> 01:24:30,125
He can remember insane details. Ask
him anything about hip-hop. Anything.

1356
01:24:33,375 --> 01:24:34,541
All right, Shy.

1357
01:24:35,666 --> 01:24:39,041
It seems like I've known Shy forever.

1358
01:24:42,500 --> 01:24:43,541
Where to start?

1359
01:24:43,625 --> 01:24:46,041
-What's that? Oh, fuck! Guys!
-Oh, boy.

1360
01:24:46,125 --> 01:24:47,041
Holy shit!

1361
01:24:47,125 --> 01:24:49,458
-Who the fuck's throwing that?
-Oh, shit.

1362
01:24:49,541 --> 01:24:51,791
-What the fuck?
-There's glass everywhere!

1363
01:24:58,833 --> 01:25:00,583
Oh, shit!
Oh, shit, it's Shy!

1364
01:25:00,666 --> 01:25:01,833
Shy! Shy!

1365
01:25:01,916 --> 01:25:03,833
Shy, what the fuck?

1366
01:25:08,166 --> 01:25:11,000
There's like this
reserve of sadness in Shy.

1367
01:25:11,083 --> 01:25:16,708
Like he's seen the whole, bleak,
terrible truth of the universe.

1368
01:25:16,791 --> 01:25:17,750
And he's right.

1369
01:25:17,833 --> 01:25:20,750
Like, when Shy tells you
why things are fucked,

1370
01:25:20,833 --> 01:25:24,166
it's… it's hard
to argue with him.

1371
01:25:29,083 --> 01:25:31,083
Shy!

1372
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:41,458
But he's so sharp and
insightful when he wants to be.

1373
01:25:41,541 --> 01:25:43,958
And he's got,
like… I don't know.

1374
01:25:44,041 --> 01:25:47,083
Just, he's got, like,
a… a generous pain,

1375
01:25:47,166 --> 01:25:48,416
if that makes sense.

1376
01:25:48,500 --> 01:25:52,375
And I just pray for the
weather in his head to be kind.

1377
01:25:52,458 --> 01:25:53,958
To clear for a bit, you know?

1378
01:25:54,041 --> 01:25:56,500
For luck. Because
when Shy's upset,

1379
01:25:56,583 --> 01:25:59,291
it's like having a bomb
go off in the house.

1380
01:26:10,541 --> 01:26:15,500
And he has these horrifying night terrors,
and they sort of bleach into his days,

1381
01:26:15,583 --> 01:26:17,375
and you'll see it.

1382
01:26:17,458 --> 01:26:19,541
But the thing is,
I get it, you know?

1383
01:26:19,625 --> 01:26:22,208
I really get it, and I
just want to say to him,

1384
01:26:22,958 --> 01:26:26,666
"There's so much, and it's
a lot, but hold tight,

1385
01:26:26,750 --> 01:26:29,041
because you won't
always feel like this."

1386
01:26:29,125 --> 01:26:31,458
You know, and I'm lying
to him, of course.

1387
01:26:48,250 --> 01:26:50,583
You know what I'm saying,
I want all these lads,

1388
01:26:50,666 --> 01:26:53,583
and my own kids, my little
girls, you know, it's the same,

1389
01:26:53,666 --> 01:26:56,208
I want them to know that
there's something else.

1390
01:27:15,125 --> 01:27:17,500
That there's,
like, infinite things,

1391
01:27:17,583 --> 01:27:20,708
music you can't even
imagine in other places,

1392
01:27:20,791 --> 01:27:25,166
and the weather, and love, and maybe
nothing but ruin, but who knows?

1393
01:27:25,250 --> 01:27:26,208
Who knows?

1394
01:27:26,291 --> 01:27:30,416
The disaster changes shape, and it
becomes tomorrow's joy or whatever.

1395
01:27:30,500 --> 01:27:33,333
And there's... there's someone
you haven't met, and it's…

1396
01:27:34,708 --> 01:27:37,416
It's, you know… You
know what I'm saying.

1397
01:27:37,500 --> 01:27:39,208
Anyway, I'm rambling.

1398
01:27:39,291 --> 01:27:42,291
