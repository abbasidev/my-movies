<i>Grace?</i>

707
01:01:51,292 --> 01:01:53,166
[Jackson] <i>Grace! Can you hear us?</i>

708
01:01:53,167 --> 01:01:54,416
[Various voices] <i>Grace!</i>

709
01:01:54,417 --> 01:01:56,333
- <i>Grace!</i>
- <i>Grace.</i>

710
01:01:57,375 --> 01:01:58,792
<i>Grace!</i>

711
01:02:00,375 --> 01:02:02,500
[Baby cries]

712
01:02:04,875 --> 01:02:08,582
[Pam, in a low voice] She took your baby
and disappeared for hours.

713
01:02:08,583 --> 01:02:10,417
Had you frantic.

714
01:02:11,625 --> 01:02:13,625
And now she's not talking to you?

715
01:02:15,083 --> 01:02:19,625
[Jackson] She just needs some time
to herself. You know, I get that.

716
01:02:20,750 --> 01:02:22,458
[Pam] No, Jackson.

717
01:02:22,917 --> 01:02:25,207
She is not well.

718
01:02:25,208 --> 01:02:27,958
[Jackson] Well,
sometimes people aren't well, Mom.

719
01:02:29,542 --> 01:02:33,082
Sometimes people need some time
to adjust when things change.

720
01:02:33,083 --> 01:02:36,416
Sometimes everybody just needs
to have some fucking patience

721
01:02:36,417 --> 01:02:38,625
and trust that things will get better.

722
01:02:40,667 --> 01:02:42,667
Are you still sleepwalking?

723
01:02:45,417 --> 01:02:47,667
[Pam] I'm just trying to help.

724
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:52,875
Well, you are helping, Mom.

725
01:02:54,542 --> 01:02:56,041
[Jackson sighs]

726
01:02:56,042 --> 01:02:59,542
She just needs some space to... to write.

727
01:03:00,875 --> 01:03:02,875
[Pam] She says she can't.

728
01:03:05,083 --> 01:03:07,416
[Jackson] It's just like, you know...

729
01:03:07,417 --> 01:03:10,749
It's just writer's block
or whatever, I guess.

730
01:03:10,750 --> 01:03:12,958
[Lightbulb buzzes]

731
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:17,333
[High-pitched, unsettling ringing]

732
01:03:28,417 --> 01:03:31,375
[Ringing fades into subtle,
unsettling music]

733
01:03:45,458 --> 01:03:47,875
[Indistinct chatter in the background]

734
01:04:09,625 --> 01:04:12,750
[Girl] No. I don't wanna get in.

735
01:04:15,333 --> 01:04:18,416
[Man] Okay, there we are. Good job.

736
01:04:18,417 --> 01:04:21,166
- Hi.
- [Man] Alright, that's a big girl.

737
01:04:21,167 --> 01:04:22,999
That's a big girl.

738
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:25,458
- [Girl] I don't wanna go.
- [Woman] It's okay.

739
01:04:25,792 --> 01:04:28,791
- [Grace] Sorry to bother you.
- Huh?

740
01:04:28,792 --> 01:04:31,457
I think my car might have a flat tyre.

741
01:04:31,458 --> 01:04:34,416
Would you mind
just taking a look at it?

742
01:04:34,417 --> 01:04:35,707
- [Woman] Breathe.
- [Girl] No!

743
01:04:35,708 --> 01:04:38,416
[Woman] Look at Mommy.
Hey, look at Mommy.

744
01:04:38,417 --> 01:04:41,333
Babe, we don't have any time for this. No.

745
01:04:42,292 --> 01:04:44,332
- So...
- [Music intensifies]

746
01:04:44,333 --> 01:04:45,750
could you...

747
01:04:46,917 --> 01:04:48,833
[Grace] Okay. Yeah, sorry.

748
01:04:49,375 --> 01:04:51,292
[Woman] Put your leg in the car.

749
01:04:54,500 --> 01:04:56,542
[Music fades]

750
01:04:59,333 --> 01:05:00,958
Alright?

751
01:05:08,958 --> 01:05:11,208
When was the last time we had sex?

752
01:05:13,292 --> 01:05:14,917
Rough guess.

753
01:05:17,417 --> 01:05:19,249
I really couldn't say, Gracie.

754
01:05:19,250 --> 01:05:22,167
Go on, take a stab.

755
01:05:22,875 --> 01:05:24,958
[He clears his throat]

756
01:05:25,542 --> 01:05:27,416
I don't know. Like a month?

757
01:05:27,417 --> 01:05:29,333
Try two and a half.

758
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:32,957
Well, things have been, you know.

759
01:05:32,958 --> 01:05:35,582
And it was four in the morning
and you were essentially asleep.

760
01:05:35,583 --> 01:05:36,958
Grace.

761
01:05:38,083 --> 01:05:39,499
And the time before that,

762
01:05:39,500 --> 01:05:41,707
we were watching TV
about that thing on the island,

763
01:05:41,708 --> 01:05:44,332
and I was begging you,
and you put a towel down.

764
01:05:44,333 --> 01:05:45,917
Alright, alright, alright.

765
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:48,332
It used to be good, right?

766
01:05:48,333 --> 01:05:49,957
[Loud rumble]

767
01:05:49,958 --> 01:05:51,249
[Jackson] It's still good, Grace.

768
01:05:51,250 --> 01:05:54,457
It doesn't exist, Jackson.
It's not a thing.

769
01:05:54,458 --> 01:05:56,624
Alright, I'm gonna put more effort in.

770
01:05:56,625 --> 01:05:58,167
Tonight?

771
01:05:59,250 --> 01:06:00,707
- Okay.
- [Grace] You want me?

772
01:06:00,708 --> 01:06:02,917
[Jackson] Yeah, I want you.

773
01:06:03,625 --> 01:06:05,458
Say it again.

774
01:06:07,125 --> 01:06:08,792
I... I want you, yeah.

775
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:14,916
- Before or after dinner?
- Grace, man.

776
01:06:14,917 --> 01:06:17,667
- Just have a fucking opinion.
- Jesus fucking Christ!

777
01:06:18,458 --> 01:06:20,417
[He clears his throat, sighs]

778
01:06:22,917 --> 01:06:24,542
When we get home?

779
01:06:25,583 --> 01:06:26,999
Yeah.

780
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:29,166
You'll fuck me when we get home?

781
01:06:29,167 --> 01:06:30,791
Yeah.

782
01:06:30,792 --> 01:06:32,375
In the car?

783
01:06:33,500 --> 01:06:34,582
If you like.

784
01:06:34,583 --> 01:06:36,916
We used to fuck in the car
all the time, remember?

785
01:06:36,917 --> 01:06:38,250
[Jackson] Uh-huh.

786
01:06:38,750 --> 01:06:41,542
I'll unbuckle, come over
to your seat and you'll fuck me?

787
01:06:42,292 --> 01:06:43,375
Yes.

788
01:06:49,792 --> 01:06:51,208
Yes.

789
01:07:03,875 --> 01:07:06,374
Come on.
My mom's right there.

790
01:07:06,375 --> 01:07:07,875
Fuck me quickly, then.

791
01:07:11,125 --> 01:07:12,500
I don't...

792
01:07:12,958 --> 01:07:14,917
[She breathes heavily]

793
01:07:16,375 --> 01:07:18,416
Grace, come on. I'm just kinda...

794
01:07:18,417 --> 01:07:20,208
[Zipper scratches]

795
01:07:20,917 --> 01:07:23,291
You impotent piece of shit.

796
01:07:23,292 --> 01:07:25,333
You useless fucking faggot!

797
01:07:27,250 --> 01:07:29,541
You're fucking insane.

798
01:07:29,542 --> 01:07:31,166
Fucking insane.

799
01:07:31,167 --> 01:07:33,250
Everything okay?

800
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:00,000
[Clattering and shattering]

801
01:08:19,917 --> 01:08:22,417
[Heavy thud, water gushes]

802
01:08:51,832 --> 01:08:54,042
[Footsteps approach]

803
01:09:02,082 --> 01:09:04,456
- Open the door. I need to use it.
- Piss outside.

804
01:09:04,457 --> 01:09:06,956
[Jackson, grunting] I don't need to piss.

805
01:09:06,957 --> 01:09:08,956
[Grace] Shit in a bush. I don't care.

806
01:09:08,957 --> 01:09:11,792
Oh, God, Grace!

807
01:09:12,707 --> 01:09:14,207
Grace!

808
01:09:17,957 --> 01:09:21,081
I don't wanna shit in a bush.
I wanna shit in the toilet.

809
01:09:21,082 --> 01:09:23,332
[Grace and Jackson chuckle]

810
01:09:25,375 --> 01:09:27,207
Come on, it's coming out.

811
01:09:29,042 --> 01:09:30,667
Come on.

812
01:09:32,457 --> 01:09:34,125
It's gonna be all over the floor.

813
01:09:38,792 --> 01:09:40,292
I'm starting to smell it.

814
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:42,331
Quick.

815
01:09:42,332 --> 01:09:44,082
Thank you.

816
01:09:48,292 --> 01:09:50,000
Jesus Christ.

817
01:10:13,750 --> 01:10:15,082
[Woman] No running, please.

818
01:10:15,083 --> 01:10:17,167
- Hi. Hey! Come on in.
- Hey.

819
01:10:18,125 --> 01:10:19,166
Greg!

820
01:10:19,167 --> 01:10:22,416
Yeah. Greg said we have
enough food to feed a village.

821
01:10:22,417 --> 01:10:25,832
- Well, that's what we've got, right?
- [Lively, indistinct chatter]

822
01:10:25,833 --> 01:10:28,207
Well, you can add these, I guess.

823
01:10:28,208 --> 01:10:30,707
They fell over in the car.
They looked better when we got them.

824
01:10:30,708 --> 01:10:32,291
What happened to your fingers?

825
01:10:32,292 --> 01:10:34,582
I burnt them trying to bake you a cake.

826
01:10:34,583 --> 01:10:36,957
- Hey, man.
- [Man] There you are. Welcome, buddy.

827
01:10:36,958 --> 01:10:38,916
- Good to see you.
- [Jackson] You too, man.

828
01:10:38,917 --> 01:10:40,957
- [Man] Hi.
- [Jackson] The place looks great.

829
01:10:40,958 --> 01:10:43,707
[Woman] He's such a beautiful baby.

830
01:10:43,708 --> 01:10:45,916
- Jack, let's get you a drink.
- Does he want a snack?

831
01:10:45,917 --> 01:10:49,249
- Sure. Whatever the kids are having.
- Okay. No allergies?

832
01:10:49,250 --> 01:10:50,625
No. I don't think so.

833
01:10:52,292 --> 01:10:53,832
[Woman] Who's a sweetie-pie?

834
01:10:53,833 --> 01:10:55,333
Here's Jack's boy.

835
01:11:02,583 --> 01:11:04,417
Did you guys see this?

836
01:11:05,125 --> 01:11:07,499
[They laugh]

837
01:11:07,500 --> 01:11:11,250
[Indistinct, lively chatter;
Quiet folk music in the background]

838
01:11:13,708 --> 01:11:16,541
- [Music concludes]
- So, you think you'll have another one?

839
01:11:16,542 --> 01:11:19,791
Yeah. Pregnant now.
Cookin' up twins.

840
01:11:19,792 --> 01:11:21,417
What happened to your hands?

841
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:23,499
Oh.

842
01:11:23,500 --> 01:11:25,749
You should see the wall.

843
01:11:25,750 --> 01:11:28,916
[She chuckles] Yeah, I...

844
01:11:28,917 --> 01:11:30,833
I have two kids, and...

845
01:11:31,958 --> 01:11:35,457
and two is a lot, if I'm being honest.

846
01:11:35,458 --> 01:11:37,041
Seems like it.

847
01:11:37,042 --> 01:11:40,124
Babies, though, babies are hard.

848
01:11:40,125 --> 01:11:41,874
I don't think anybody
talks about that enough.

849
01:11:41,875 --> 01:11:44,167
It's all anyone talks about.

850
01:11:44,750 --> 01:11:46,708
[Woman 2, chuckling] It changes you.

851
01:11:47,417 --> 01:11:50,500
I think I nearly lost my mind
for the first six months.

852
01:11:51,583 --> 01:11:53,625
When do you think
you'll be getting it back?

853
01:11:59,667 --> 01:12:02,916
You know, postnatal depression
is so much more common

854
01:12:02,917 --> 01:12:04,374
than people think.

855
01:12:04,375 --> 01:12:06,791
[Indistinct conversation
in the background]

856
01:12:06,792 --> 01:12:09,542
- What do you do for work, Grace?
- [Grace] I don't.

857
01:12:12,667 --> 01:12:16,417
I'm stuck between wanting to do something
and not wanting to do...

858
01:12:17,417 --> 01:12:19,082
anything at all.

859
01:12:19,083 --> 01:12:23,166
[Woman 2] Hang on.
Cheryl mentioned that you're a writer.

860
01:12:23,167 --> 01:12:24,666
That's cute. That must be nice.

861
01:12:24,667 --> 01:12:26,749
Having something you can squeeze
around a baby.

862
01:12:26,750 --> 01:12:30,667
- Yeah, I don't do that anymore.
- Why not? Stuck for inspiration?

863
01:12:31,708 --> 01:12:33,250
I'm sure it'll come back.

864
01:12:37,458 --> 01:12:40,375
[Indistinct conversations;
Children yell playfully]

865
01:12:47,500 --> 01:12:49,125
[Jackson] Grace?

866
01:12:49,750 --> 01:12:51,208
Grace!

867
01:12:52,167 --> 01:12:53,958
[Woman 3] Oh, my God!

868
01:13:02,167 --> 01:13:04,667
[Greg] Jackson? Jackson?
Look at me, okay? Hey.

869
01:13:06,333 --> 01:13:09,166
- Can you breathe?
- [Man 2] Somebody get some water.

870
01:13:09,167 --> 01:13:10,957
- Jackson?
- [Greg] Let me call someone.

871
01:13:10,958 --> 01:13:12,832
- What, your chest hurts?
- [He pants] Yeah.

872
01:13:12,833 --> 01:13:16,374
- You can breathe. Breathe with me.
- [Greg] I think it's them at the door.

873
01:13:16,375 --> 01:13:18,749
[Jackson breathes heavily]

874
01:13:18,750 --> 01:13:20,250
Yeah. See?

875
01:13:24,167 --> 01:13:26,707
Yeah, you're okay. You're okay.

876
01:13:26,708 --> 01:13:29,208
[Breath grows steady]

877
01:13:32,500 --> 01:13:33,499
He's okay.

878
01:13:33,500 --> 01:13:35,875
[Upbeat twist music]

879
01:13:37,125 --> 01:13:39,374
It's just kind of a wake-up call,
you know.

880
