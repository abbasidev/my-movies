1
00:01:33,135 --> 00:01:34,303
Welcome.

2
00:01:38,182 --> 00:01:41,352
Our best guess, there's about
250, 275 people in there.

3
00:01:41,435 --> 00:01:42,728
It's hard to count.

4
00:01:42,812 --> 00:01:45,147
We need to be prepared
for, like, 300 people

5
00:01:45,231 --> 00:01:47,107
by the time we get there, right?

6
00:01:47,191 --> 00:01:48,984
Our cargo container,

7
00:01:49,068 --> 00:01:53,113
18-wheeler, that thing
only holds 160 people.

8
00:01:53,197 --> 00:01:54,716
I'm talking 'bout crammed
in there tight...

9
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:56,242
That's cheek to jowl.

10
00:01:56,325 --> 00:01:57,785
Smashed face to face.

11
00:01:57,868 --> 00:01:59,620
Women and children first.

12
00:01:59,703 --> 00:02:01,997
Listen,
whoever's not on with us,

13
00:02:02,081 --> 00:02:03,642
-they just run, on foot.
-Just go.

14
00:02:03,666 --> 00:02:05,835
That's it.
If they're not with us, they run.

15
00:02:05,918 --> 00:02:08,003
Via de la Amistad,
that's our exit route.

16
00:02:08,087 --> 00:02:11,298
Runs east-west.
It's about one mile from 905.

17
00:02:11,382 --> 00:02:13,509
-Right.
-What you draggin' in that wagon?

18
00:02:13,592 --> 00:02:15,845
Listen, I got HMEs.

19
00:02:15,928 --> 00:02:18,281
I got mortars, I got tear gas,
I got whatever you guys need,

20
00:02:18,305 --> 00:02:21,183
but I'm a little unclear
as to what the plan is.

21
00:02:21,267 --> 00:02:23,435
-I'm gonna need some direction.
-Don't be unclear.

22
00:02:23,936 --> 00:02:26,105
-I got a plan for us.
-Well, what is it?

23
00:02:26,188 --> 00:02:27,499
I mean, you want me
to create a diversion?

24
00:02:27,523 --> 00:02:28,667
You want me to blow something up?

25
00:02:28,691 --> 00:02:29,692
What do you want?

26
00:02:31,026 --> 00:02:33,153
I want you to create a show, Pat.

27
00:02:34,405 --> 00:02:37,199
Okay? This is the announcement
of the motherfuckin' revolution.

28
00:02:37,283 --> 00:02:39,702
-Yeah.
-Make it good. Make it bright.

29
00:02:39,785 --> 00:02:40,870
Impress me.

30
00:02:40,953 --> 00:02:42,955
Team Two's entrance.
We got that?

31
00:02:43,038 --> 00:02:44,307
Yep.
That runs north and south.

32
00:02:44,331 --> 00:02:45,475
Perfect, perfect, perfect.

33
00:02:45,499 --> 00:02:47,060
-Give Pat a walkie.
-Gimme a walkie.

34
00:02:47,084 --> 00:02:48,645
Big truck
coming up Enrico Fermi...

35
00:02:48,669 --> 00:02:49,879
-Channel five.
-Copy that.

36
00:02:49,962 --> 00:02:51,857
Yeah! It's game time.
No more talking 'bout this.

37
00:02:51,881 --> 00:02:53,024
-Let's go!
-All right, let's go,

38
00:02:53,048 --> 00:02:54,648
-let's go, let's go.
-Let's fuckin' go.

39
00:03:02,349 --> 00:03:03,589
Watch, watch, watch.

40
00:03:14,403 --> 00:03:16,883
Get on your knees,
like you 'bout to suck a dick.

41
00:03:27,458 --> 00:03:28,626
Gate guard secure.

42
00:03:43,724 --> 00:03:46,518
Hey, you.
Get up. Hands up. Get up.

43
00:03:51,023 --> 00:03:52,459
-Down. Hey you, get up.
-Get your hands up.

44
00:03:52,483 --> 00:03:54,294
-Wake up. All the way up!
-Down on the ground.

45
00:03:54,318 --> 00:03:55,378
Hands up. Don't look at me.

46
00:03:55,402 --> 00:03:56,487
-All the way up.
-Wake up.

47
00:04:33,399 --> 00:04:35,025
Wake up, soldier boy.

48
00:04:36,986 --> 00:04:38,630
You died and went
to pussy heaven, motherfucker.

49
00:04:38,654 --> 00:04:41,031
Put your arms to the side
so I can see you.

50
00:04:48,914 --> 00:04:50,514
What's your name, dickhead?

51
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:56,964
I'm Captain Steven J. Lockjaw.

52
00:04:58,173 --> 00:04:59,758
My name is Perfidia Beverly Hills,

53
00:04:59,842 --> 00:05:01,468
and this is a declaration of war.

54
00:05:02,469 --> 00:05:04,680
We're here to right your wrongs,
motherfucker.

55
00:05:04,763 --> 00:05:06,449
You got an army growin'
in your fuckin' guts,

56
00:05:06,473 --> 00:05:07,891
and you put it there.

57
00:05:08,726 --> 00:05:09,977
You didn't count on me.

58
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:12,260
-Oh, my God.
-You didn't count on my fight.

59
00:05:12,896 --> 00:05:14,565
The message is clear.

60
00:05:14,648 --> 00:05:16,483
Free borders, free bodies, free choices,

61
00:05:16,567 --> 00:05:18,068
and free from fuckin' fear!

62
00:05:19,778 --> 00:05:21,739
Sweet thing.

63
00:05:23,365 --> 00:05:24,616
Is this funny?

64
00:05:25,826 --> 00:05:26,827
Mm.

65
00:05:29,121 --> 00:05:30,247
Get up.

66
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:34,543
Not on your feet.

67
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:38,839
Oh, not on your fuckin' feet.

68
00:05:42,718 --> 00:05:44,219
Since we playin'...

69
00:05:45,429 --> 00:05:46,513
get it up.

70
00:05:50,184 --> 00:05:51,185
Up.

71
00:05:52,895 --> 00:05:53,896
Yeah.

72
00:05:55,189 --> 00:05:56,523
Get it up.

73
00:05:58,817 --> 00:05:59,818
Guys, hurry up!

74
00:06:01,945 --> 00:06:04,239
Be careful! Hurry, hurry, hurry!

75
00:06:04,323 --> 00:06:06,784
<i>Apurarse.</i> Hurry, hurry, hurry!
But be careful!

76
00:06:06,867 --> 00:06:08,869
Be careful!
All the way to the back.

77
00:06:09,453 --> 00:06:10,829
Holy shit.

78
00:06:14,291 --> 00:06:15,751
Keep it moving now.

79
00:06:16,585 --> 00:06:17,586
Up.

80
00:06:19,171 --> 00:06:20,172
Good boy.

81
00:06:21,465 --> 00:06:23,008
Mm.

82
00:06:23,092 --> 00:06:25,511
You like lockin' people up, huh?

83
00:06:26,386 --> 00:06:28,680
-Mm.
-Oh, yeah.

84
00:06:29,598 --> 00:06:31,809
Get on your fuckin' knees!

85
00:06:32,392 --> 00:06:33,435
Now.

86
00:06:34,686 --> 00:06:35,979
Let's go, let's go.

87
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:38,982
Put it on.

88
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:42,778
Let's go!

89
00:06:48,992 --> 00:06:50,577
Now get the fuck up.

90
00:06:53,831 --> 00:06:55,874
Let's go. Hands up.
Keep that dick up.

91
00:06:55,958 --> 00:06:57,209
Keep it up.

92
00:06:58,335 --> 00:06:59,336
The fuck out.

93
00:07:05,050 --> 00:07:06,343
Pat.

94
00:07:06,426 --> 00:07:07,546
<i>Go for Pat.</i>

95
00:07:08,178 --> 00:07:09,680
<i>Snap, crackle, pop, baby.</i>

96
00:07:09,763 --> 00:07:10,806
Copy that.

97
00:07:19,523 --> 00:07:20,607
Come on, come on!

98
00:07:21,859 --> 00:07:25,863
I declare war, motherfucker.

99
00:07:41,545 --> 00:07:43,172
I'll be seeing you very soon.

100
00:07:44,590 --> 00:07:46,717
Not if I see you first, fuck face.

101
00:07:52,764 --> 00:07:55,017
We are a political organization

102
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:57,436
that is free from the eyes,

103
00:07:57,519 --> 00:07:59,521
the ears, and most importantly,

104
00:07:59,605 --> 00:08:02,274
the weapons of the imperialist state,

105
00:08:02,357 --> 00:08:04,193
and this fascist regime!

106
00:08:05,611 --> 00:08:09,239
You are a political prisoner
of the French 75, motherfuckers!

107
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:12,326
You've been captured by the French 75!

108
00:08:14,369 --> 00:08:15,787
Fuck the police!

109
00:08:15,871 --> 00:08:18,123
<i>-¡Viva la revolución!</i>
-Let's go!

110
00:08:23,754 --> 00:08:25,064
Motherfuckers, <i>órale!</i>

111
00:08:25,088 --> 00:08:27,341
Wait! Wait, wait, wait!

112
00:08:27,424 --> 00:08:29,551
-Hold on, y'all, hold on.
-Shit. Oh, shit.

113
00:08:29,635 --> 00:08:31,112
Where you get
all this energy from?

114
00:08:31,136 --> 00:08:32,572
What are you talkin' about?

115
00:08:32,596 --> 00:08:34,199
I'm getting Ghetto Pat tonight.
I think I like you.

116
00:08:34,223 --> 00:08:35,742
-You like Black girls?
-Mm-hmm.

117
00:08:35,766 --> 00:08:36,850
-Yeah?
-Do I like what?

118
00:08:36,934 --> 00:08:38,644
You like...

119
00:08:38,727 --> 00:08:40,455
Y'all think he like Black girls?
Y'all think he like me?

120
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:42,290
-I think he does.
-'Course I fuckin' like Black girls!

121
00:08:42,314 --> 00:08:43,732
So shoot this shit up! Let's go!

122
00:08:43,815 --> 00:08:45,418
What the fuck
do you think I'm doing here?

123
00:08:45,442 --> 00:08:47,128
-Let's go!
-Fuck your mother!

124
00:08:47,152 --> 00:08:48,755
You know
I like fuckin' Black girls!

125
00:08:48,779 --> 00:08:49,905
You know I like Black girls.

126
00:08:49,988 --> 00:08:51,716
And I love you. You love me?
Tell me you love me.

127
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:53,259
-Tell me you fuckin' love me.
-I love you.

128
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:59,122
Calm down. Calm the fuck down.

129
00:09:01,333 --> 00:09:03,585
What I'm doing here

130
00:09:03,669 --> 00:09:06,380
is I'm creating a closed circuit

131
00:09:07,547 --> 00:09:11,343
to remove any static electricity.

132
00:09:15,347 --> 00:09:16,682
And that right there...

133
00:09:18,267 --> 00:09:20,269
That's a shunt. You see that?

134
00:09:20,352 --> 00:09:21,353
Yeah.

135
00:09:21,937 --> 00:09:23,814
This is your blasting cap.

136
00:09:23,897 --> 00:09:24,898
Mm.

137
00:09:25,816 --> 00:09:26,858
Right here.

138
00:09:31,196 --> 00:09:34,533
Very important to keep
your cap shunted like this

139
00:09:34,616 --> 00:09:36,493
when you enter the courthouse.
You got that?

140
00:09:38,078 --> 00:09:40,289
Here's your main charge.

141
00:09:40,372 --> 00:09:42,416
This is your cell phone.

142
00:09:43,208 --> 00:09:45,752
Don't stop.
I see the cell phone.

143
00:09:46,670 --> 00:09:49,274
First thing you're gonna do
is you're gonna turn on your cell phone

144
00:09:49,298 --> 00:09:51,925
without your...

145
00:09:53,093 --> 00:09:54,303
without your cap attached...

146
00:09:54,386 --> 00:09:57,597
so you don't accidentally
detonate your charge.

147
00:09:59,099 --> 00:10:00,183
You're gonna wanna...

148
00:10:00,267 --> 00:10:03,520
You're gonna wanna
put your hands here, right?

149
00:10:03,603 --> 00:10:05,897
-Mmm.
-And then you wanna

150
00:10:05,981 --> 00:10:07,816
take your hands and the cap

151
00:10:09,192 --> 00:10:11,278
and throw it in the circle.

152
00:10:11,361 --> 00:10:14,323
<i>Senator Wilson,
this is a warning for you.</i>

153
00:10:14,406 --> 00:10:16,325
We planted a bomb
at the Haymarket office

154
00:10:16,408 --> 00:10:18,452
of your re-election campaign.

155
00:10:18,535 --> 00:10:22,289
We warned you, that abortion ban,
and you didn't wanna fuckin' listen.

156
00:10:22,372 --> 00:10:25,751
So, for my sisters in need,
we will strike.

157
00:10:26,335 --> 00:10:29,338
Sincerely yours,
Perfidia Beverly Hills, motherfucker.

158
00:10:33,925 --> 00:10:36,219
<i>Revolutionary violence is the only way.</i>

159
00:10:36,303 --> 00:10:37,971
No more tellin' me to vote.

160
00:10:38,055 --> 00:10:39,198
No more tellin' me to overcome.

161
00:10:39,222 --> 00:10:41,391
"Nobody move, nobody get hurt" shit,
it doesn't matter.

162
00:10:41,475 --> 00:10:42,642
Everybody pays.

163
00:10:44,186 --> 00:10:46,688
Don't even bother
lookin' for the French 75.

164
00:10:46,772 --> 00:10:48,190
We'll find you.

165
00:10:59,534 --> 00:11:01,161
-Okay, baby, you ready?
-Yeah.

166
00:11:09,419 --> 00:11:12,381
All right. All right, all right.
Let's go.

167
00:11:14,883 --> 00:11:16,385
-Babe...
-Yeah?

168
00:11:16,468 --> 00:11:17,528
Let's fuck while the bomb go off.

169
00:11:17,552 --> 00:11:18,887
-No, babe.
-Come on, baby.

170
00:11:18,970 --> 00:11:20,448
-Let's fuck, baby.
-Come on, baby, we gotta go.

171
00:11:20,472 --> 00:11:21,807
-Hurry.
-Come on. Come on, baby.

172
00:11:23,016 --> 00:11:24,851
-Let's fuck, baby.
-No, baby. We gotta go.

173
00:11:24,935 --> 00:11:26,695
-Come on, come on. Baby.
-Come on. Come on.

174
00:11:26,770 --> 00:11:28,570
-Come on, baby.
-We gotta go. Come on, baby.

175
00:11:28,647 --> 00:11:31,358
-Come on, baby. Hold on. Wait.
-Bomb goes off in two minutes.

176
00:11:51,878 --> 00:11:52,879
Bring 'em all!

177
00:11:56,133 --> 00:11:57,213
Come on!

178
00:12:03,974 --> 00:12:06,393
Don't say a fuckin' word, okay?
You understand me?

179
00:12:09,438 --> 00:12:10,748
-Get the rest!
-Oh, yeah.

180
00:12:10,772 --> 00:12:11,958
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

181
00:12:11,982 --> 00:12:13,817
Come on, come on!

182
00:12:20,490 --> 00:12:22,009
Stay right there.
Don't you fuckin' move.

183
00:12:22,033 --> 00:12:23,034
Grab him! Let's go.

184
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:24,953
Stay right fucking there, okay?

185
00:12:25,036 --> 00:12:26,996
You fucking move,
I'll blow your fucking head off.

186
00:12:41,219 --> 00:12:42,846
Regular-working White girl.

187
00:12:43,555 --> 00:12:44,890
Now do your thing.

188
00:13:02,782 --> 00:13:05,285
<i>We have two devices</i>
<i>for two locations,</i>

189
00:13:05,368 --> 00:13:07,329
<i>set three blocks apart.</i>

190
00:13:07,412 --> 00:13:10,457
<i>Mae West completes her device

194
00:13:19,758 --> 00:13:23,053
<i>From here on in,
it's one battle after another.</i>

195
00:14:25,198 --> 00:14:26,783
What do you want me to do?

196
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:28,618
I want you to do your worst.

197
00:14:29,953 --> 00:14:32,080
You can blow up anything you want,

198
00:14:32,163 --> 00:14:34,040
it doesn't make any difference to me.

199
00:14:35,375 --> 00:14:36,668
I want my hat.

200
00:14:37,794 --> 00:14:39,004
And my gun.

201
00:14:41,548 --> 00:14:44,593
If you wanna keep doing
what you're doing,

202
00:14:44,676 --> 00:14:47,721
you'll meet me
at the Primrose Path, 2300.

00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:00,085
Wanna take my shoes off.

209
00:16:00,168 --> 00:16:04,881
-Shut... up.
-Uh-huh.

Bitch, I felt like Tony Montana!

216
00:16:49,884 --> 00:16:51,344
Yeah!

217
00:16:51,428 --> 00:16:52,512
Fuck!

218
00:16:52,595 --> 00:16:54,723
-Yes!
-It's cathartic.

219
00:16:54,806 --> 00:16:56,558
This pussy right here...

220
00:16:56,641 --> 00:16:58,351
-That one?
-What's it for?

221
00:16:58,768 --> 00:17:00,895
-Um... Fun!
-War! Bitch.

222
00:17:00,979 --> 00:17:02,147
-Nah.
-Oh.

223
00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:04,190
The pussy ain't for fun.
This is the fun.

224
00:17:04,274 --> 00:17:06,025
The guns is the fuckin' fun.

225
00:17:06,651 --> 00:17:08,403
Pussy is the fucking weapon.

226
00:17:08,486 --> 00:17:09,654
I mean...

227
00:17:11,489 --> 00:17:12,991
I see it.

228
00:17:13,074 --> 00:17:17,203
A White-bred, philistine,
asshole corporate culture,

229
00:17:17,287 --> 00:17:21,666
whose only end is to perfect
the science of advertising.

230
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:22,810
But I ain't gonna hold ya, bitch.

231
00:17:22,834 --> 00:17:24,270
If he treats me different after I drop

232
00:17:24,294 --> 00:17:26,296
this motherfucker thing
inside my stomach, bitch,

233
00:17:26,379 --> 00:17:27,672
we gonna have a fuckin' problem.

234
00:17:27,756 --> 00:17:29,466
-Kill him, too.
-Bae, stop.

235
00:17:29,549 --> 00:17:31,926
I'll kill him dead!

236
00:17:32,010 --> 00:17:33,678
Before he beats me!

237
00:17:35,889 --> 00:17:37,348
What the fuck? That...

238
00:17:37,432 --> 00:17:39,392
It's like she doesn't even
realize she's pregnant.

239
00:17:39,434 --> 00:17:41,686
Some other
white chocolate daddy over there

240
00:17:41,770 --> 00:17:42,896
and all this shit.

241
00:17:42,979 --> 00:17:45,259
-You right.
-You feel me? No...

242
00:17:46,191 --> 00:17:49,194
Okay, so put one up and down.

243
00:17:49,277 --> 00:17:51,362
-Okay.
-Okay, so that means...

244
00:17:53,865 --> 00:17:55,658
-I'm the house.
-Okay, yeah.

245
00:17:58,328 --> 00:18:01,080
<i>You know, you are
so unsuitable for my daughter.</i>

246
00:18:01,748 --> 00:18:02,957
Me?

247
00:18:03,041 --> 00:18:04,125
Yeah, you.

248
00:18:05,293 --> 00:18:06,669
And that's hilarious.

249
00:18:08,296 --> 00:18:09,380
I don't...

250
00:18:09,464 --> 00:18:13,510
My child comes
from a whole line of revolutionaries.

251
00:18:13,593 --> 00:18:15,303
And you look so lost.

252
00:18:16,054 --> 00:18:20,141
She's a runner, and you a stump.

253
00:18:21,351 --> 00:18:23,937
What are you gonna do
about this baby? Hm?

254
00:18:35,323 --> 00:18:39,285
<i>No, I just,</i>
<i>I wanna feel seen and loved and...</i>

255
00:18:39,369 --> 00:18:41,538
<i>I fuckin' carried her nine months.</i>

256
00:18:42,622 --> 00:18:44,958
<i>And now he can just,
gets to fuckin' walk around...</i>

257
00:18:45,041 --> 00:18:47,210
<i>and just swoonin' all fuckin' day.</i>

258
00:18:48,211 --> 00:18:50,672
<i>It's like she's his only girl.</i>

259
00:18:51,422 --> 00:18:54,259
<i>Like, I just no longer exist.
I'm just a fuckin' piece of meat.</i>

260
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:57,929
<i>And sometimes, I feel crazy,
'cause I'm just like...</i>

261
00:18:58,012 --> 00:19:01,391
<i>am I weird for being jealous of my baby?</i>

262
00:19:02,642 --> 00:19:05,103
I don't fuckin' feel seen.
I don't feel love.

263
00:19:05,186 --> 00:19:07,605
I feel fuckin' ugly. My nipples hurt.

264
00:19:07,689 --> 00:19:09,941
I can barely fucking produce milk.

265
00:19:12,986 --> 00:19:15,071
I'm not okay.

266
00:19:26,541 --> 00:19:28,418
Baby, where do you think
you're goin', huh?

267
00:19:29,085 --> 00:19:31,713
-Where you goin' like that?
-Stop talkin' to me.

268
00:19:31,796 --> 00:19:33,256
I go as I please.

269
00:19:33,339 --> 00:19:36,342
You realize that
we're a family now, right?

270
00:19:36,426 --> 00:19:38,177
You don't have to do this anymore.

271
00:19:38,803 --> 00:19:42,223
You realize I put myself first, right?
And that's what you scared of.

272
00:19:43,808 --> 00:19:45,101
We have her now.

273
00:19:45,768 --> 00:19:46,936
You do get that, right?

274
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:50,148
I put myself first,
and I reject your lack of originality.

275
00:19:50,231 --> 00:19:54,110
God, my lack of originality.
Will you stop with all this bullshit?

276
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:56,404
Would you stop it?
We're a goddamn family.

277
00:19:57,155 --> 00:19:58,823
You have her to take care of.

278
00:19:59,407 --> 00:20:01,007
Where the hell
do you think you're goin'?

279
00:20:10,752 --> 00:20:12,587
It's okay, baby.

280
00:20:12,670 --> 00:20:16,466
It's okay, baby.
It's okay. It's okay, baby.

281
00:20:17,759 --> 00:20:18,885
It's okay.

282
00:20:20,553 --> 00:20:22,221
This is a new consciousness.

283
00:20:23,014 --> 00:20:25,350
-New consciousness?
-Yeah.

284
00:20:26,476 --> 00:20:28,019
I'm not your udder buddy.

285
00:20:29,395 --> 00:20:31,105
I'm not your mother.

286
00:20:32,857 --> 00:20:34,275
You want your power over me,

287
00:20:34,359 --> 00:20:36,569
the same reason you want
your power over the world.

288
00:20:37,737 --> 00:20:40,990
You and your crumblin' male ego

289
00:20:41,074 --> 00:20:43,409
will never do this revolution like me.

290
00:20:43,493 --> 00:20:45,078
Fuck outta here.

291
00:20:45,161 --> 00:20:47,830
Do the revolution, baby.
Go do it.

292
00:21:09,602 --> 00:21:10,687
You got a baby?

293
00:21:13,231 --> 00:21:14,315
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

294
00:21:14,399 --> 00:21:15,900
Male? Female?

295
00:21:15,984 --> 00:21:17,986
She's a girl.

296
00:21:19,612 --> 00:21:20,780
What's her name?

297
00:21:21,739 --> 00:21:22,782
Charlene.

298
00:21:23,324 --> 00:21:24,492
Charlene.

299
00:21:25,952 --> 00:21:27,662
Sounds like a Black girl's name.

300
00:21:30,957 --> 00:21:32,291
You like Black girls?

301
00:21:33,376 --> 00:21:34,627
I love 'em.

302
00:21:35,837 --> 00:21:37,005
I love them!

303
00:21:57,692 --> 00:21:59,586
-Get on your knees.
-Get on your fuckin' knees.

304
00:21:59,610 --> 00:22:01,170
-Don't move.
-Now!

305
00:22:01,195 --> 00:22:02,030
Good job.

306
00:22:02,113 --> 00:22:03,906
Get your noses
in the carpet.

307
00:22:04,657 --> 00:22:06,993
My name is Junglepussy.

308
00:22:07,076 --> 00:22:09,454
This is what power looks like.

309
00:22:09,537 --> 00:22:10,848
-Put it in.
-See my face?

310
00:22:10,872 --> 00:22:12,040
Put it there.

311
00:22:12,123 --> 00:22:14,476
-This some <i>Set It Off</i> shit.
-Hands up. Put your hands up.

312
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:16,461
-I don't want you.
-Put your hands up.

313
00:22:16,544 --> 00:22:18,379
I just want your money.

314
00:22:18,463 --> 00:22:22,425
Your money pays
for my artillery, my supplies,

315
00:22:22,508 --> 00:22:26,554
my transportation,
my dynamite, my message.

316
00:22:27,430 --> 00:22:29,474
I am what Black Power looks like.

317
00:22:30,183 --> 00:22:31,434
See my face?

318
00:22:32,477 --> 00:22:34,020
See my face!

319
00:22:34,103 --> 00:22:36,272
I'm the French 75!

320
00:22:40,943 --> 00:22:42,028
Stop moving.

321
00:22:44,363 --> 00:22:47,200
Stop fucking moving.

322
00:22:49,786 --> 00:22:51,704
Stop fuckin' moving, man.

323
00:23:07,929 --> 00:23:08,930
All right, go.

324
00:24:58,873 --> 00:25:01,042
Cuff the left arm, please.

325
00:25:23,981 --> 00:25:25,781
This department
doesn't do any special favors,

326
00:25:25,858 --> 00:25:27,568
especially for Black girls.

327
00:25:28,694 --> 00:25:30,571
You're a killer,
and that's the least of it.

328
00:25:30,655 --> 00:25:33,991
You'll do 30, 40 years in prison.

329
00:25:36,244 --> 00:25:38,621
It's too bad you don't know
anybody with sway.

330
00:25:48,589 --> 00:25:50,216
You can save me.

331
00:26:09,485 --> 00:26:11,404
Because you're in love with me.

332
00:26:13,823 --> 00:26:14,865
Yes.

333
00:26:17,243 --> 00:26:19,245
And you can't live without me.

334
00:26:20,997 --> 00:26:22,415
Can you hold me?

335
00:26:24,625 --> 00:26:26,669
I can give you the embrace

336
00:26:28,337 --> 00:26:30,381
of the federal government.

337
00:26:32,466 --> 00:26:34,760
You've gotta tell me
where they are, and name names.

338
00:26:36,220 --> 00:26:37,596
Don't do this.

339
00:26:39,348 --> 00:26:42,476
You have to name names,
or you're gonna go to prison.

340
00:26:44,854 --> 00:26:46,081
Miss Minnie,

341
00:26:46,105 --> 00:26:47,815
do you have a car seat or a carrier?

342
00:26:47,898 --> 00:26:49,108
No, no, no, baby.

343
00:26:49,191 --> 00:26:52,445
These are two scanners that I've made.

344
00:26:52,528 --> 00:26:54,113
This one plays Melody A.

345
00:26:54,196 --> 00:26:55,948
-This one plays Melody B.
-Uh-huh.

346
00:26:56,032 --> 00:26:58,826
Together, they go off
within 200 or 300 yards of each other,

347
00:26:58,909 --> 00:27:00,911
they sync up,
they'll play a main melody.

348
00:27:00,995 --> 00:27:02,639
-Main melody.
-Okay? Somebody else has one of these,

349
00:27:02,663 --> 00:27:04,766
you both know the tune,
you'll be able to find each other.

350
00:27:04,790 --> 00:27:06,709
-This is a trust device.
-Right.

351
00:27:06,792 --> 00:27:08,586
Okay? Rule of thumb
with these scanners,

352
00:27:08,669 --> 00:27:10,939
find somebody else out there
and they happen to have one of these,

353
00:27:10,963 --> 00:27:12,506
trust them with your life, okay?

354
00:27:12,590 --> 00:27:14,383
I'm not passing these out
to just anybody.

355
00:27:14,467 --> 00:27:16,028
-She might be hungry.
-I need some towels.

356
00:27:16,052 --> 00:27:17,720
Miss Minnie,
can you get me some towels?

357
00:27:17,803 --> 00:27:18,846
Yeah. All right.

358
00:27:18,929 --> 00:27:21,182
Okay. What's wrong?

359
00:27:21,265 --> 00:27:22,933
I know. We're going.

360
00:27:23,017 --> 00:27:24,828
-Get a phone or don't...
-If you gotta get a cell, make it 1G.

361
00:27:24,852 --> 00:27:25,853
The early analogue stuff,

362
00:27:25,936 --> 00:27:27,539
they don't scan
those frequencies anymore.

363
00:27:27,563 --> 00:27:29,148
You'll be fine.
Otherwise, no phones.

364
00:27:29,231 --> 00:27:30,292
-Okay.
-If the towers are up,

365
00:27:30,316 --> 00:27:32,318
we're gonna be able to find
each other in any case.

366
00:27:32,401 --> 00:27:34,528
-All right.
-Memorize everything in this envelope.

367
00:27:34,612 --> 00:27:35,863
Burn it when you're done.

368
00:27:35,946 --> 00:27:38,157
You don't go to Baktan Cross right away.

369
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:40,910
You go to Denver first.
You spend a week in Denver.

370
00:27:40,993 --> 00:27:44,163
While you're in Denver,
plant those decoys.

371
00:27:44,246 --> 00:27:46,415
When that's all clear
and that job is done,

372
00:27:46,499 --> 00:27:48,250
then you go on to Baktan Cross.

373
00:27:48,334 --> 00:27:50,169
These are the new names and socials.

374
00:27:50,252 --> 00:27:52,171
Right, so who are
we supposed to be here?

375
00:27:52,254 --> 00:27:53,923
You are Bob and Willa Ferguson.

376
00:27:54,006 --> 00:27:56,634
It's a mother and son who died
in childbirth last month.

377
00:27:56,717 --> 00:27:58,969
So we're pretending to be dead folks?

378
00:27:59,053 --> 00:28:00,614
If you wanna think about it
that way, yes,

379
00:28:00,638 --> 00:28:03,075
but there are bigger deaths
down the line if we don't do this.

380
00:28:03,099 --> 00:28:04,868
I want you to think
big picture here, all right?

381
00:28:04,892 --> 00:28:06,370
-Right. Right.
-This is bigger than you or I.

382
00:28:06,394 --> 00:28:08,330
This is bigger than the original
Bob and Willa Ferguson, okay?

383
00:28:08,354 --> 00:28:09,706
Guys, you better hurry up.

384
00:28:09,730 --> 00:28:10,815
Yeah.

385
00:28:10,898 --> 00:28:12,441
Welcome to the world, Bob.

386
00:28:12,525 --> 00:28:14,110
Let's go! Big picture.

387
00:28:14,193 --> 00:28:15,611
Got it. Yeah.

388
00:28:16,529 --> 00:28:17,530
Okay.

389
00:28:18,614 --> 00:28:20,658
Okay. Okay.

390
00:28:24,036 --> 00:28:25,276
You're safe.

391
00:28:26,497 --> 00:28:28,416
-I gotta go. I'm sorry, okay?
-Okay.

392
00:28:28,499 --> 00:28:30,126
-I know you do, but...
-I'm sorry.

393
00:28:30,209 --> 00:28:32,270
I know, but you not sure
you wanna let her stay with us?

394
00:28:32,294 --> 00:28:33,772
-I gotta go, I gotta go!
-I know, I know.

395
00:28:33,796 --> 00:28:35,965
But travel in grace.
Oh, my God.

396
00:28:36,632 --> 00:28:38,592
Here. Hold her.

397
00:28:38,676 --> 00:28:40,719
-All right, I got her, I got her.
-Thanks.

398
00:28:44,432 --> 00:28:46,725
-Come on, baby girl, come on.
-Watch her head.

399
00:28:48,853 --> 00:28:49,854
All right.

400
00:28:51,605 --> 00:28:53,649
-Love you.
-I love you.

401
00:29:00,489 --> 00:29:02,408
-Take care.
-Stay safe.

402
00:29:02,491 --> 00:29:03,534
Okay.

403
00:29:08,497 --> 00:29:09,874

Teachin' the right kind
of history, I hope.

447
00:35:23,914 --> 00:35:25,123
Lincoln.

448
00:35:25,207 --> 00:35:26,208
Mm-hmm.

449
00:35:26,291 --> 00:35:28,502
I see you got
all the greats here, huh?

450
00:35:28,585 --> 00:35:29,711
Oh, yeah.

451
00:35:29,795 --> 00:35:31,421
What were his intentions?

452
00:35:32,506 --> 00:35:34,758
Got Teddy Roosevelt over there.
You got...

453
00:35:35,425 --> 00:35:37,761
Hope you teach about
the Philippines and all that.

454
00:35:37,845 --> 00:35:39,763
We don't get all
into the details just yet,

455
00:35:39,847 --> 00:35:42,182
-but we don't hide from them, either.
-You should.

456
00:35:42,266 --> 00:35:44,017
You should.
Gotta tell the truth.

457
00:35:45,185 --> 00:35:48,647
And then you got
the Grand Wizard over there, right?

458
00:35:48,730 --> 00:35:50,649
-Mr. Benjamin Franklin.
-Mm.

459
00:35:51,316 --> 00:35:52,317
Forefather.

460
00:35:52,818 --> 00:35:54,069
-Hm?
-Mm.

461
00:35:54,152 --> 00:35:55,237
Fuckin' slave owner.

462
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:58,115
You... I'm afraid you can't do that
here in the classroom.

463
00:35:59,491 --> 00:36:01,660
-Fuckin' slave owners everywhere.
-Thanks.

464
00:36:03,537 --> 00:36:04,538
Um...

465
00:36:05,414 --> 00:36:09,459
Well, overall, to get into it,

466
00:36:09,543 --> 00:36:12,421
Willa's doing really great.

467
00:36:12,504 --> 00:36:13,505
Mm.

468
00:36:13,589 --> 00:36:15,883
She's a confident leader.

469
00:36:15,966 --> 00:36:18,051
-Mm-hmm.
-She works hard.

470
00:36:18,135 --> 00:36:22,347
You can tell that she actually cares
about being a good student, you know?

471
00:36:22,431 --> 00:36:26,226
She enters class each day
ready to work, full of energy.

472
00:36:27,811 --> 00:36:29,563
The other students
really admire her, um...

473
00:36:30,939 --> 00:36:32,024
Are you okay?

474
00:36:35,986 --> 00:36:37,988
If I get emotional, it's just um...

475
00:36:38,739 --> 00:36:41,283
-tears of joy, that's all.
-Oh.

476
00:36:41,366 --> 00:36:44,036
I see this is very emotional for you.

477
00:36:44,745 --> 00:36:45,746
I don't know...

478
00:36:48,123 --> 00:36:50,375
You know, Willa grew up without her mom.

479
00:36:50,459 --> 00:36:53,295
Her mom died
when she was very young.

480
00:36:53,921 --> 00:36:56,131
Oh. I see.

481
00:36:57,299 --> 00:36:58,300
Hm.

482
00:36:59,468 --> 00:37:00,695
So Willa never
knew her mother?

483
00:37:00,719 --> 00:37:02,846
No. She never did.

484
00:37:03,805 --> 00:37:05,725
That can be very hard
on a young woman.

485
00:37:33,710 --> 00:37:35,963
Sir, I have Lieutenant Skinner here
to speak with you.

486
00:37:46,306 --> 00:37:47,533
What do you got, Skinner?

487
00:37:47,557 --> 00:37:51,353
Sir, Deputy Director of Progress
has orders to speak to you, sir.

488
00:37:51,436 --> 00:37:54,523
Your transportation is set
for 1800 hours, sir.

489
00:37:55,649 --> 00:37:57,567
You know what this is about, Skinner?

490
00:37:57,651 --> 00:37:59,571
-No, sir, I'm...
-Well, I think I do.

491
00:38:02,197 --> 00:38:03,532
That'll be all, Lieutenant.

492
00:38:19,006 --> 00:38:20,632
Welcome, Colonel.
Please follow me.

493
00:39:05,552 --> 00:39:07,447
Have somebody tell my wife
I'll be down in a few minutes.

494
00:39:07,471 --> 00:39:09,222
Colonel Lockjaw,
thanks for coming.

495
00:39:09,306 --> 00:39:10,575
Sandy, great to see you.

496
00:39:10,599 --> 00:39:12,285
Let me introduce you
to Virgil Throckmorton.

497
00:39:12,309 --> 00:39:14,394
-Virgil, Colonel Steve Lockjaw.
-Steve Lockjaw.

498
00:39:14,478 --> 00:39:16,164
-How do you do, Colonel?
-My pleasure, sir.

499
00:39:16,188 --> 00:39:18,732
Yeah, I'm sorry about all the espionage
at the back entrance.

500
00:39:18,815 --> 00:39:20,901
My daughter's getting married
and dress was formal.

501
00:39:20,984 --> 00:39:22,462
So, we didn't want you
to feel out of place.

502
00:39:22,486 --> 00:39:23,686
Perfectly understandable, sir.

503
00:39:23,737 --> 00:39:24,738
Please, sit.

504
00:39:26,073 --> 00:39:27,282
Shane Mitchell sends a hello.

505
00:39:27,365 --> 00:39:30,827
The big dog.
He still building out that garage?

506
00:39:30,911 --> 00:39:32,831
The construction project
that never ends.

507
00:39:32,871 --> 00:39:34,991
I'm sure he'll get it done.
Will you give him my best?

508
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:36,184
-Will do.
-Thank you.

509
00:39:36,208 --> 00:39:37,648
How was your journey
from Rio Duarte?

510
00:39:37,709 --> 00:39:38,710
Fine, sir.

511
00:39:38,794 --> 00:39:39,896
You're doing great work down there.

512
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:41,064
Thank you very much, sir.

513
00:39:41,088 --> 00:39:42,923
Each and every day
is hand-to-hand combat

514
00:39:43,006 --> 00:39:45,008
in the spread
of uncontrolled migration, isn't it?

515
00:39:45,092 --> 00:39:47,344
-Yes, it is, sir.
-Yeah.

516
00:39:47,427 --> 00:39:50,972
Well, "You wanna save the planet,
you start with immigration."

517
00:39:51,056 --> 00:39:52,474
That's exactly right, sir.

518
00:39:52,974 --> 00:39:54,726
You said that.

519
00:39:54,810 --> 00:39:56,937
A few years back,
after Squatting Pebble.

520
00:39:57,020 --> 00:39:58,105
Ah.

521
00:40:02,609 --> 00:40:04,945
I understand you've expressed
an interest in us.

522
00:40:05,904 --> 00:40:07,489
Yes, sir, I have.

523
00:40:07,572 --> 00:40:10,992
And does it honor you to be considered
for membership in our club?

524
00:40:11,576 --> 00:40:14,538
It's a very deep honor, sir.
Yes, it is.

525
00:40:15,205 --> 00:40:18,375
Steve, we have, in the past,

526
00:40:18,458 --> 00:40:21,837
offered membership
to certain members of the military.

527
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:25,340
We found their tactical
battlefield expertise

528
00:40:25,423 --> 00:40:27,551
to be quite useful.

529
00:40:27,634 --> 00:40:30,720
Now, our aim and your aim is the same.

530
00:40:31,346 --> 00:40:33,348
To find dangerous lunatics,

531
00:40:33,431 --> 00:40:36,810
haters, and punk trash
and stop them.

532
00:40:38,562 --> 00:40:40,313
No more lunatics.

533
00:40:41,189 --> 00:40:42,357
Mm.

534
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:44,484
Now, I'm not sure
if you've heard or not,

535
00:40:44,568 --> 00:40:46,778
but Jim Kringle passed away.

536
00:40:46,862 --> 00:40:48,262
Oh, I did hear that, yes.

537
00:40:49,364 --> 00:40:51,074
This means an opening.

538
00:40:51,158 --> 00:40:53,368
-Mm.
-Colonel,

539
00:40:53,451 --> 00:40:56,454
I don't think I'm being immodest
when I say

540
00:40:56,538 --> 00:40:59,040
that joining
the Christmas Adventurers Club

541
00:41:00,083 --> 00:41:02,294
means that you are a superior man.

542
00:41:03,128 --> 00:41:06,298
No, not the best man,
not the most intelligent,

543
00:41:06,381 --> 00:41:09,092
the most sophisticated,
or the wisest.

544
00:41:09,176 --> 00:41:12,512
It just means that you are superior
to other human beings,

545
00:41:12,596 --> 00:41:15,307
and you shall never want for riches

546
00:41:15,390 --> 00:41:17,100
or the greatest of friends.

547
00:41:18,018 --> 00:41:22,147
Now, we report to ourselves
with a freedom to be creative

548
00:41:22,230 --> 00:41:24,858
and cut through layers of bureaucracy.

549
00:41:24,941 --> 00:41:26,818
We live by the Golden Rule,

550
00:41:26,902 --> 00:41:29,905
in a network
of like-minded men and women

551
00:41:29,988 --> 00:41:32,449
dedicated to makin' the world
safe and pure.

552
00:41:36,036 --> 00:41:37,638
What would you say
to someone who believes

553
00:41:37,662 --> 00:41:41,458
that you have been soft
in your duty to racial purification?

554
00:41:42,876 --> 00:41:46,713
I would say they are a liar
who has no business in society.

555
00:41:46,796 --> 00:41:49,549
Or on the planet, for that matter. Mm.

556
00:41:50,884 --> 00:41:53,637
-Do you presently live with a spouse?
-No, sir.

557
00:41:53,720 --> 00:41:56,556
Have you ever consulted
with a mental health professional?

558
00:41:56,640 --> 00:41:57,641
No, sir.

559
00:41:57,724 --> 00:42:00,936
Have you ever had any bills or debts
turned over to a collection agency?

560
00:42:01,603 --> 00:42:03,772
Mm. Well, I did purchase a jet ski.

561
00:42:03,855 --> 00:42:07,984
It was an evolution
of the old Hummingbird Whisperdoo 238.

562
00:42:08,068 --> 00:42:10,362
Called the Dynamite Dolphin 335.

563
00:42:10,445 --> 00:42:11,529
It was defective.

564
00:42:11,613 --> 00:42:14,783
I abstained from payment.
I'd do it again. I have no regrets.

565
00:42:15,784 --> 00:42:16,868
Okay.

566
00:42:18,078 --> 00:42:20,455
Have you ever knowingly engaged

567
00:42:20,538 --> 00:42:22,791
in any acts of terrorism
against this country?

568
00:42:22,874 --> 00:42:24,292
No, sir.

569
00:42:25,627 --> 00:42:28,755
Have you ever engaged
in an interracial relationship?

570
00:42:28,838 --> 00:42:30,423
No, sir.

571
00:42:31,716 --> 00:42:33,760
And you are
American-born by gentile?

572
00:42:33,843 --> 00:42:34,844
Yes, sir.

573
00:42:36,638 --> 00:42:37,639
Mm-hmm.

574
00:42:38,598 --> 00:42:41,268
Now, to avoid any misunderstanding,

575
00:42:41,351 --> 00:42:45,146
we require absolute secrecy
through the initiation process

576
00:42:45,230 --> 00:42:47,816
to judge how serious
and unselfish you are.

577
00:42:47,899 --> 00:42:49,401
-You understand?
-Mm-hmm.

578
00:42:50,110 --> 00:42:53,196
And to be considered to a vote,

579
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:56,908
you must submit
to a voluntary vulnerability study.

580
00:42:56,992 --> 00:42:59,661
This identifies anything problematic
in your character.

581
00:43:00,287 --> 00:43:01,705
What could be a problem?

582
00:43:02,580 --> 00:43:05,166
I don't know.
What could be a problem?

583
00:43:05,250 --> 00:43:07,210
Absolutely nothing.

584
00:43:07,294 --> 00:43:09,004
We wanna know
who we're standing with.

585
00:43:09,087 --> 00:43:10,338
Sure.

586
00:43:10,422 --> 00:43:14,968
Now, it's a Double Yankee
White Inquisitions <i>Completum.</i>

587
00:43:15,051 --> 00:43:17,470
So if you have any doubt
as to your ability

588
00:43:17,554 --> 00:43:18,888
to qualify in body or character

589
00:43:18,972 --> 00:43:21,266
as a member
of the Christmas Adventurers Club,

590
00:43:22,183 --> 00:43:24,185
now you have an opportunity to say so.

591
00:43:26,938 --> 00:43:29,691
-Do you wish to withdraw?
-No, sir.

592
00:43:30,358 --> 00:43:31,860
Do you submit yourself?

593
00:43:32,736 --> 00:43:35,739
Yes, sir. I submit myself.

594
00:43:36,448 --> 00:43:37,949
Very well, then.

595
00:43:39,743 --> 00:43:41,786
Now Sandy and I have
to get down to cut the cake.

596
00:43:41,870 --> 00:43:42,871
Oh.

597
00:43:43,830 --> 00:43:46,124
Congratulations
on your daughter's wedding.

598
00:43:46,207 --> 00:43:48,460
Thank you. We'll be in touch.

599
00:43:48,543 --> 00:43:49,878
Thank you.

600
00:43:49,961 --> 00:43:52,172
-Steve.
-Thank you, sir. Thank you, Sandy.

601
00:44:40,678 --> 00:44:42,823
<i>Maybe starting</i>
<i>to see how corrupt to the core</i>

602
00:44:42,847 --> 00:44:45,225

603
00:44:45,308 --> 00:44:48,144

604

Don't think they're separate.

00:45:42,407 --> 00:45:44,659
Don't break them apart.
They're not...

624
00:45:44,742 --> 00:45:46,161
What the fuck?

625
00:46:29,913 --> 00:46:32,040
"QST, QST, QST!"

626
00:46:32,123 --> 00:46:33,958
Attention, all sanctuary stations.

627
00:46:34,042 --> 00:46:35,585
Billy Goat is in the wind.

628
00:46:35,668 --> 00:46:38,087

What's up, my man?
You got my guy?

639
00:47:04,405 --> 00:47:05,615
Any SSE in the car?

640
00:47:05,698 --> 00:47:06,908
-No.
-No?

641
00:47:07,951 --> 00:47:09,202
Come here, dirt bag.

642
00:47:18,086 --> 00:47:19,837
Howard Sommerville.

643
00:47:19,921 --> 00:47:21,548
-How are you?
-Good.

644
00:47:21,631 --> 00:47:23,675
The French 75.

645
00:47:23,758 --> 00:47:24,926
The Resistance.

646
00:47:26,553 --> 00:47:28,304
The Gringo Coyote?

647
00:47:28,388 --> 00:47:29,681
Billy Goat?

648
00:47:29,764 --> 00:47:32,016
-Done your homework.
-Mm-hmm.

649
00:47:32,100 --> 00:47:35,311
Good. Take a look around.
Take it all in.

650
00:47:36,437 --> 00:47:37,772
Do you need anything?

651
00:47:37,855 --> 00:47:39,315
-I'm fine.
-A drink?

652
00:47:39,399 --> 00:47:40,650
I'm okay.

653
00:47:40,733 --> 00:47:43,111
You're still alive.
That's a good sign, right?

654
00:47:43,194 --> 00:47:44,320
Seem to be.

655
00:47:44,404 --> 00:47:45,923
Yeah.
Do you know why you're still alive?

656
00:47:45,947 --> 00:47:48,074
-You tell me.
-I will tell you.

657
00:47:48,157 --> 00:47:50,994
I need you to tell me
where Baby Charlene is,

658
00:47:51,077 --> 00:47:53,037
what's her name, where does she live?

659
00:47:53,121 --> 00:47:55,498
I need to know
where The Rocket Man lives.

660
00:47:55,582 --> 00:47:56,791
I need to know his name.

661
00:47:58,501 --> 00:48:00,128
-Okay.
-Ghetto Pat.

662
00:48:00,211 --> 00:48:03,131
Okay. I can cooperate.

663
00:48:03,214 --> 00:48:06,509
Their names are Fred Flintstone
and Arthur Fonzarelli

664
00:48:06,593 --> 00:48:08,720
and their address is Alpha Centauri.

665
00:48:10,430 --> 00:48:12,056
I love it. I love it.

666
00:48:12,140 --> 00:48:14,976
Motherfucker's sittin' on plastic
in a container, he's still got jokes.

667
00:48:15,059 --> 00:48:17,339
I just want you
to know that I'm not scared.

668
00:48:18,688 --> 00:48:19,897
I appreciate that.

669
00:48:19,981 --> 00:48:22,191
If I was in your shoes,
I wouldn't be scared, either.

670
00:48:23,192 --> 00:48:25,903
I just don't know if your sister
would feel that way.

671
00:48:25,987 --> 00:48:27,363
What's his sister's name?

672
00:48:27,447 --> 00:48:28,448
Pamela.

673
00:48:34,454 --> 00:48:35,830
Oh, no more jokes?

674
00:48:40,209 --> 00:48:42,211
What are their names
and where do they live?

675
00:48:49,344 --> 00:48:51,387
Their names are Bob and Willa Ferguson.

676
00:48:51,471 --> 00:48:52,889
They're up in Baktan Cross.

677
00:48:55,516 --> 00:48:56,934
Baktan Cross.

678
00:48:57,935 --> 00:49:00,480
Make me a reason
to deploy in that town.

679
00:49:00,563 --> 00:49:02,106
-Drugs and tacos.
-Got it.

680
00:49:02,190 --> 00:49:04,692
And get all the intel
on the gathering spots,

681
00:49:04,776 --> 00:49:06,569
the hotspots for teenyboppers.

682
00:49:06,653 --> 00:49:07,862
On it.

683
00:49:17,038 --> 00:49:18,039
Shep.

684
00:49:18,831 --> 00:49:20,833
Shep. Hey, come here, come here.

685
00:49:20,917 --> 00:49:22,752
Where'd you...

686
00:49:22,835 --> 00:49:25,672
Come, come with me. How ya doin'?

687
00:49:29,550 --> 00:49:30,718
Get it!

688
00:49:31,386 --> 00:49:33,096
Shep!

689
00:49:37,392 --> 00:49:38,393
Shep.

690
00:49:40,937 --> 00:49:41,938
Shep.

691
00:49:42,021 --> 00:49:44,023
Gentlemen, this is Operation Boot Heel.

692
00:49:44,107 --> 00:49:45,858
Our AO is Baktan Cross.

693
00:49:45,942 --> 00:49:49,278
This is a sanctuary city
full of thousands of wet 'n stinkies.

694
00:49:49,362 --> 00:49:52,490
We have a TST operation
to capture two HVIs.

695
00:49:52,573 --> 00:49:54,158
Adult male, Bob Ferguson.

696
00:49:54,242 --> 00:49:57,286
Female juvenile, Willa Ferguson,
age 16, the daughter.

697
00:49:57,370 --> 00:49:59,831
We bag-and-tag the male.
We apprehend the female.

698
00:50:29,110 --> 00:50:30,337
<i>Intel update.</i>

699
00:50:30,361 --> 00:50:33,197
<i>Baktan High School dance today, 1800.</i>

700
00:50:33,281 --> 00:50:34,532
<i>Grades nine through 12.</i>

701
00:50:35,700 --> 00:50:37,744
<i>Break, break, break,
net call one-three.</i>

702
00:50:37,827 --> 00:50:39,847
<i>We're gonna split the team.
Cell One to the high school.</i>

703
00:50:39,871 --> 00:50:41,956
<i>Cell Two to the residence with me.</i>

704
00:50:58,306 --> 00:51:00,600
<i>Good evening, gentlemen.
Special Agent Toejam.</i>

705
00:51:01,309 --> 00:51:02,435
<i>Our main target tonight is</i>

706
00:51:02,518 --> 00:51:04,729
<i>Rimhorn's Chicken Lickin'
Frozen Food Farm.</i>

707
00:51:04,812 --> 00:51:08,232
HUMINT reporting has led us to believe
Chicken Lickin' is a front

708
00:51:08,316 --> 00:51:11,319
for a large-scale heroin distribution
operation within the AO.

709
00:51:12,195 --> 00:51:14,197
BTR, your main effort,

710
00:51:14,280 --> 00:51:16,532
you are tasked
with the clearing and securing

711
00:51:16,616 --> 00:51:18,868
of Chicken Lickin' Frozen Food Farm
in order to destroy

712
00:51:18,951 --> 00:51:20,995
heroin distribution operations
within the AO.

713
00:51:21,746 --> 00:51:23,748
Simultaneously,
local law enforcement,

714
00:51:23,831 --> 00:51:26,918
<i>you will clear
and secure Blatski's Tires,</i>

715
00:51:27,001 --> 00:51:29,837
<i>Raliberto's Mexican Restaurant
on Old California Road,</i>

716
00:51:29,921 --> 00:51:32,423
<i>Tiburón's Taco Shack
in the Baktan Mall,</i>

717
00:51:32,507 --> 00:51:35,051
<i>and the gas station
on J and Boiler Street.</i>

718
00:51:35,134 --> 00:51:38,429
<i>This is a sanctuary city
for thousands of wet bodies.</i>

719
00:51:38,513 --> 00:51:42,225
<i>Expect the local populace
to be sympathetic and supportive</i>

720
00:51:42,308 --> 00:51:44,703
<i>to the criminal organizations
we are targeting tonight, gentlemen.</i>

721
00:52:00,409 --> 00:52:01,744
Thank you.

722
00:52:02,995 --> 00:52:05,373
You're hungover,
and you got home at 3:00 in the morning.

723
00:52:05,456 --> 00:52:07,124
Where were you?

724
00:52:07,208 --> 00:52:09,836
Where, what?
This isn't even warm, sweetie.

725
00:52:09,919 --> 00:52:11,337
Where were you?

726
00:52:11,420 --> 00:52:13,506
Where was I? I was...

727
00:52:13,589 --> 00:52:16,425
Well, I specifically told you
where I was.

728
00:52:16,509 --> 00:52:18,261
You asked me that.
I told you where I was.

729
00:52:18,344 --> 00:52:21,013
I was at the Rustic Inn
with the old band.

730
00:52:21,597 --> 00:52:23,891
You remember our old band, right?

731
00:52:25,893 --> 00:52:26,894
The old band, sweetie.

732
00:52:26,978 --> 00:52:29,063
A Block Past Normal.
You remember Albert?

733
00:52:29,146 --> 00:52:29,981
Yeah.

734
00:52:30,064 --> 00:52:33,401
Turns out, Albert bought
all this old equipment

735
00:52:33,484 --> 00:52:36,112
from Steely Dan's old studio

736
00:52:36,195 --> 00:52:38,990
to try to get that sort of vintage,
you know,

737
00:52:39,073 --> 00:52:41,367
that sort of crackling tube sound.

738
00:52:41,450 --> 00:52:44,036
You don't need any of
that stuff anymore.

739
00:52:44,120 --> 00:52:45,997
He brought out a computer program.

740
00:52:46,080 --> 00:52:47,182
Boom, with the press of a button...

741
00:52:47,206 --> 00:52:48,206
How'd you get home?

742
00:52:48,958 --> 00:52:50,334
What do you mean?

743
00:52:50,418 --> 00:52:52,879
-How did you get home?
-Well, with my car.

744
00:52:52,962 --> 00:52:54,005
You drove?

745
00:52:56,048 --> 00:52:58,342
So what are you, my babysitter?
What, what, what...

746
00:52:58,426 --> 00:53:00,386
-Yeah.
-I know how to drink and drive, honey.

747
00:53:00,469 --> 00:53:01,846
I know what I'm doin'.

748
00:53:01,929 --> 00:53:03,490
-I didn't have that much.
-Dad.

749
00:53:03,514 --> 00:53:05,558
What? What?

750
00:53:05,641 --> 00:53:06,976
What?

751
00:53:07,059 --> 00:53:08,603
I don't wanna be your babysitter.

752
00:53:08,686 --> 00:53:10,038
I don't wanna worry
if you wrapped your car

753
00:53:10,062 --> 00:53:10,980
around a telephone pole.

754
00:53:11,063 --> 00:53:12,958
-Well, I didn't wrap my...
-I didn't ask for this.

755
00:53:12,982 --> 00:53:14,902
That's just how the cards
were rolled out for me.

756
00:53:16,903 --> 00:53:18,529
-It's "dice," sweetie.
-What?

757
00:53:18,613 --> 00:53:21,032
It's not "cards."
You don't roll cards. It's dice.

758
00:53:21,115 --> 00:53:23,492
Fuck off, Bob.
Just fuck off with that, okay?

759
00:53:23,576 --> 00:53:24,576
Grow up.

760
00:53:25,536 --> 00:53:26,787
Wow. Okay.

761
00:53:28,456 --> 00:53:29,749
Well, you... Look.

762
00:53:29,832 --> 00:53:31,351
I like the way
you're standin' up for yourself.

763
00:53:31,375 --> 00:53:33,044
I'm proud of ya, honey,

764
00:53:33,127 --> 00:53:34,503
but the way you, uh,

765
00:53:34,587 --> 00:53:36,839
speak to your father sometimes,
it's just...

766
00:53:37,632 --> 00:53:38,799
I don't know. You're right.

767
00:53:39,508 --> 00:53:41,719
You should tell me
what you think, always.

768
00:53:41,802 --> 00:53:43,179
Never hold anything back from me.

769
00:53:43,262 --> 00:53:45,014
What the fuck is wrong with you?

770
00:53:45,097 --> 00:53:47,767
You're right.
That's somethin' I gotta remember.

771
00:53:47,850 --> 00:53:49,894
And I fuck up sometimes.

772
00:53:52,939 --> 00:53:55,399
Whoa. Who's this? Who's that?

773
00:53:56,525 --> 00:53:58,611
-Who is that?
-They're just my friends.

774
00:53:58,694 --> 00:54:02,740
And they just, they have
a red car like that, just drivin'...

775
00:54:02,823 --> 00:54:03,991
Little loud, don't you think?

776
00:54:04,075 --> 00:54:05,075
It's just a car.

777
00:54:05,117 --> 00:54:06,553
And you told 'em
they could do that?

778
00:54:06,577 --> 00:54:07,846
-Yes.
-Told 'em to come to the house?

779
00:54:07,870 --> 00:54:08,704
Yes!

780
00:54:08,788 --> 00:54:10,539
Now, who's the one with the lipstick?

781
00:54:10,623 --> 00:54:11,958
What's that one's name?

782
00:54:12,708 --> 00:54:13,708
-Bobo.
-Bobo.

783
00:54:13,751 --> 00:54:15,628
Now, is that a he
or a she or a they?

784
00:54:15,711 --> 00:54:16,587
Dad, come on.

785
00:54:16,671 --> 00:54:18,440
No, are they transitioning?
I wanna know if...

786
00:54:18,464 --> 00:54:19,504
They're nonbinary.

787
00:54:19,548 --> 00:54:21,068
Okay, I just wanna be polite.
All right.

788
00:54:21,092 --> 00:54:22,885
It's not that hard! "They, them."

789
00:54:23,970 --> 00:54:25,656
And who's this little fuckin' freak
at the door?

790
00:54:25,680 --> 00:54:26,514
Probably Bluto.

791
00:54:26,597 --> 00:54:27,908
They're just comin'
to my house like this, huh?

792
00:54:27,932 --> 00:54:29,183
-Yes!
-All right.

793
00:54:29,266 --> 00:54:30,851
Is that your date to the dance?

794
00:54:30,935 --> 00:54:32,353
-My friend.
-Okay.

795
00:54:32,436 --> 00:54:35,189
You're not goin' anywhere with
your goddamn friend until you take it.

796
00:54:35,815 --> 00:54:36,815
Take it!

797
00:54:43,239 --> 00:54:45,258
-Yep. Put it in your pocket.
-I don't wanna put it in my pocket.

798
00:54:45,282 --> 00:54:47,135
Put it in your garter
or whatever you got.

799
00:54:47,159 --> 00:54:47,994
My fucking garter?

800
00:54:48,077 --> 00:54:49,513
What? Mother...

801
00:54:49,537 --> 00:54:51,205
-What's up, homie?
-Hey, how's it goin'?

802
00:54:51,288 --> 00:54:52,289
-You cool?
-Yeah.

803
00:54:52,373 --> 00:54:53,684
-I was just here to pick up Willa.
-Yeah, yeah.

804
00:54:53,708 --> 00:54:56,210
You normally knock that loud
at somebody's house like that?

805
00:54:56,293 --> 00:54:57,893
-Uh, yeah.
-Yeah, give us a sec, homie.

806
00:54:58,796 --> 00:55:00,548
Put it in... You got a purse?

807
00:55:00,631 --> 00:55:03,175
This is non-negotiable!
Put it in your purse!

808
00:55:03,259 --> 00:55:05,386
Nobody's coming to get you, Bob.
You know that, right?

809
00:55:05,469 --> 00:55:06,637
That's what you think.

810
00:55:08,014 --> 00:55:10,683
What's up, guys?
You guys cool?

811
00:55:10,766 --> 00:55:12,309
-You guys hangin'?
-Yep.

812
00:55:12,393 --> 00:55:13,644
Goin' to the dance?

813
00:55:13,728 --> 00:55:14,812
Yeah, it's cool.

814
00:55:16,063 --> 00:55:17,374
Listen,
I'm gonna tell you somethin',

815
00:55:17,398 --> 00:55:19,543
whatever you do to her,
I'm gonna do that exact same thing

816
00:55:19,567 --> 00:55:20,767
to your entire fuckin' family.

817
00:55:20,818 --> 00:55:22,361
-I'm not fuckin' around.
-Wait, what?

818
00:55:22,445 --> 00:55:23,547
-Dad?
-I'm just tellin' ya.

819
00:55:23,571 --> 00:55:25,281
We're talkin' about freedom, baby.

820
00:55:25,364 --> 00:55:26,615
We're talkin' about freedom.

821
00:55:27,324 --> 00:55:28,593
Freedom's a funny thing,
isn't it?

822
00:55:28,617 --> 00:55:31,245
When ya have it, you...
you don't appreciate it,

823
00:55:31,328 --> 00:55:32,997
and when you miss it, it's gone.

824
00:55:33,080 --> 00:55:35,499
-It's just gone. Poof!
-Okay.

825
00:55:38,002 --> 00:55:40,230
There's a quinoa casserole
with Frosted Flakes in the oven.

826
00:55:40,254 --> 00:55:42,006
-Don't leave it on.
-Got it.

827
00:55:42,089 --> 00:55:43,591
-Have fun, homie.
-All right.

828
00:55:43,674 --> 00:55:44,800
All right, cool.

829
00:55:44,884 --> 00:55:46,135
Let go of him.

830
00:55:50,222 --> 00:55:51,348
Yo!

831
00:55:51,432 --> 00:55:53,225
-Yeah?
-Not you, <i>ese.</i>

832
00:55:53,309 --> 00:55:55,352
Her, I'm talkin' to her.
Get in the fuckin' car.

833
00:55:56,520 --> 00:55:57,521
Say it.

834
00:55:58,647 --> 00:55:59,857
Say it, baby.

835
00:56:00,691 --> 00:56:02,068
Love you, Bob.

836
00:56:02,151 --> 00:56:03,235
Love you, too.

837
00:56:07,782 --> 00:56:09,158
Fuckin' freaks.

838
00:56:10,034 --> 00:56:11,428
Does anyone have a charger?
My phone's dead.

839
00:56:11,452 --> 00:56:12,536
No. I love your skirt.

840
00:56:12,620 --> 00:56:14,455
-Thank you. I love your dress.
-Thanks.

841
00:56:14,538 --> 00:56:16,165
Your dad's aggro, bro.

842
00:56:16,248 --> 00:56:17,917
He's fuckin' paranoid, okay?

843
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:19,251

-Wait, who got that video?
-And...

849
00:56:38,646 --> 00:56:40,106
No. That's not even the best part.

850
00:56:40,189 --> 00:56:43,776
-And she literally threw up on it.
-Oops. Sorry.

-Yes!

852

someone out there

-Wait.

Come on, baby,

860

"Green Acres, Beverly Hillbillies,

Hooterville Junction."

862
00:57:19,186 --> 00:57:20,746
"Will no longer be
so goddamn relevant."

863
00:57:20,813 --> 00:57:21,814
"And women will not care

866
00:57:25,985 --> 00:57:27,653
"Looking for a brighter day."

00:57:33,742 --> 00:57:35,244
to trust 'em with my life.

870
00:57:35,327 --> 00:57:37,163
All right, right now, you need to.

871
00:57:37,246 --> 00:57:38,926
'Cause you're in trouble, Willa.
All right?

872
00:57:38,998 --> 00:57:40,791
Now, there's an SOS signal out.

873
00:57:40,875 --> 00:57:42,042
I am here to help.

874
00:57:42,126 --> 00:57:43,711
But we have to leave here right away.

875
00:57:45,087 --> 00:57:47,882
Look, I knew your mom
and your dad.

876
00:57:48,799 --> 00:57:50,986
I know you have a lot of questions,
and I'll answer 'em later,

877
00:57:51,010 --> 00:57:52,195
but right now, we have to roll.

878
00:57:52,219 --> 00:57:53,762
-Will you leave here with me?
-Where?

879
00:57:53,846 --> 00:57:55,139
Anywhere but here.

880
00:57:56,932 --> 00:57:57,933
'Kay.

Okay. You have to stay by my side,
and you have to do exactly as I say.

00:58:02,229 --> 00:58:03,689
-Do you understand?
-Yes, ma'am.

883
00:58:03,772 --> 00:58:05,191
-Do you have a phone on you?
-No.

884
00:58:05,983 --> 00:58:08,569

He'll know what to do.
He trained for this.

-Who is this?
<i>-I need the greeting code, Bob.</i>

914
00:59:57,094 --> 00:59:58,512
Oh, fuck.

915

Well, I don't remember
the fuckin' greeting code

916
01:00:02,099 --> 01:00:04,226

so Howard Sommerville has been taken.

928
01:00:39,887 --> 01:00:42,222

939
01:01:12,544 --> 01:01:14,129
She's not in the house with me,

940

more information.

01:01:21,095 --> 01:01:22,262
Okay, good. Keep her there.

-I'll be seeing...

947
01:01:27,309 --> 01:01:29,061
Well, okay.
Tell me the rendezvous point.

Okay. Okay, Bob.

Don't panic.

953
01:01:48,497 --> 01:01:50,082
Don't fuckin' panic, Bob.

954
01:01:51,166 --> 01:01:52,918
Keep your shit together.

955
01:02:02,344 --> 01:02:04,304
Don't get fuckin' paranoid, man.

956
01:02:08,225 --> 01:02:10,769
Don't get fuckin' paranoid.
Do what you gotta do.

01:02:12,479 --> 01:02:15,315
Okay, step one, step one, step one.

-Tunnel!

God damn it.

983

All you got is goddamn nunchucks here!

1040
01:09:55,859 --> 01:09:57,110
You know where I can get a gun?

1041
01:09:57,193 --> 01:09:58,278
Shit.

1042
01:09:58,361 --> 01:10:01,031
Shit. God damn it. Shit.

1043
01:10:01,114 --> 01:10:03,450
-Bob, what's going on?
-It's MKU.

1044
01:10:03,533 --> 01:10:05,118
MKU, man,
they're everywhere right now!

1045
01:10:05,201 --> 01:10:06,870
-They're everywhere.
-MKU? MKU what?

1046
01:10:06,953 --> 01:10:08,455
They busted open my door.

1047
01:10:08,538 --> 01:10:10,415
They're comin' after me
and Willa right now.

1048
01:10:10,498 --> 01:10:11,541
Right now.

1049
01:10:12,083 --> 01:10:14,044
-That's heavy metal, bro.
-Yeah.

1050
01:10:14,127 --> 01:10:16,087
Hey. Where is she?

1051
01:10:16,171 --> 01:10:18,214
I don't know.
I gotta charge my phone to find out.

1052
01:10:18,298 --> 01:10:19,341
Here, use my phone.

1053
01:10:19,424 --> 01:10:20,943
I can't, I can't.
They'll trace that phone.

1054
01:10:20,967 --> 01:10:22,260
I gotta use my phone.

1055
01:10:22,344 --> 01:10:24,064
Let's do that at my place, huh?
We gotta go.

1056
01:10:24,512 --> 01:10:25,513
Your place?

1057
01:10:25,597 --> 01:10:27,432
-Yeah.
-You got a gun at your place?

1058
01:10:27,515 --> 01:10:28,391
I'll get you a gun.

1059
01:10:28,475 --> 01:10:30,310
-You have a gun, right?
-Okay? Yes.

1060
01:10:30,393 --> 01:10:33,813
-Okay.
-Right now, it's a goddamn roundup.

1061
01:10:34,439 --> 01:10:35,982
I gotta deal with this shit.

1062
01:10:36,066 --> 01:10:37,776
Okay. Yeah, let's, let's...

1063
01:10:37,859 --> 01:10:40,087
-Let's take that to go. Come on.
-Let's go to your place.

1064
01:10:40,111 --> 01:10:42,155
Let's go to your place.
I'll charge my phone.

1065
01:10:42,238 --> 01:10:43,782
-You got a gun there.
-Bob, Bob, Bob.

1066
01:10:43,865 --> 01:10:45,867
-What? What?
-Get off the tatami.

1067
01:10:45,951 --> 01:10:47,827
-Okay. Yeah.
-Okay. Listen.

1068
01:10:47,911 --> 01:10:49,120
-Breathe.
-All right.

1069
01:10:49,204 --> 01:10:51,039
Okay? Cool out.

1070
01:10:51,790 --> 01:10:53,416
Ocean waves. Ocean waves.

1071
01:10:53,500 --> 01:10:54,709
-Ocean waves.
-Let's go.

1072
01:10:54,793 --> 01:10:57,045
Let's go. I'll follow you.
Come on.

1073
01:11:08,223 --> 01:11:10,600
Got a little Latino
Harriet Tubman situation

1074
01:11:10,684 --> 01:11:11,810
going on at my place.

1075
01:11:11,893 --> 01:11:13,979
All legit, from the heart.
No cash.

1076
01:11:14,771 --> 01:11:15,689
Here, use my phone.

1077
01:11:15,772 --> 01:11:17,899
No, no. No, no, man,
they trace that.

1078
01:11:17,983 --> 01:11:19,526
You understand?
They trace those calls.

1079
01:11:20,235 --> 01:11:22,070
-What's with the shades?
-Fuck.

1080
01:11:23,989 --> 01:11:26,366
Look, me and Willa's mom,
we used to run around

1081
01:11:26,449 --> 01:11:28,249
and do some real bad shit together,
all right?

1082
01:11:28,284 --> 01:11:30,370
We were part of the French 75.

1083
01:11:30,453 --> 01:11:32,497
They got her,
now they're comin' after us.

1084
01:11:32,580 --> 01:11:33,707
Fuck.

1085
01:11:37,043 --> 01:11:38,461
You're a bad <i>hombre,</i> Bob.

1086
01:11:44,634 --> 01:11:45,634
Sit down.

1087
01:11:49,055 --> 01:11:50,432
I'm Agent Danvers.
How are you?

1088
01:11:51,641 --> 01:11:53,393
-Great.
-Great. What's your name?

1089
01:11:53,476 --> 01:11:54,477
Bluto.

1090
01:11:54,561 --> 01:11:56,396
Bluto.
Nice to meet you, Bluto.

1091
01:11:56,479 --> 01:11:57,939
Do ya mind if I have your phone?

1092
01:11:58,023 --> 01:11:59,223
Go ahead and unlock it for me.

1093
01:11:59,899 --> 01:12:02,777
Thank you. Hey, sorry
for crashin' the party like we did

1094
01:12:02,861 --> 01:12:04,581
but we have a few questions
we wanna ask ya.

1095
01:12:04,612 --> 01:12:06,322
-Is that all right with you?
-Sure.

1096
01:12:06,406 --> 01:12:08,050
-You're shakin'. Are you okay?
-I'm fine.

1097
01:12:08,074 --> 01:12:09,451
-You nervous?
-Little bit.

1098
01:12:09,534 --> 01:12:11,095
-Do you need anything?
-No, we're good.

1099
01:12:11,119 --> 01:12:13,439
If you tell me the truth,
you're outta here in ten seconds.

1100
01:12:13,496 --> 01:12:15,057
-Yes, sir.
-If you lie to me,

1101
01:12:15,081 --> 01:12:16,142
we're gonna have some problems.

1102
01:12:16,166 --> 01:12:17,000
Yes, sir.

1103
01:12:17,083 --> 01:12:18,710
You know Willa Ferguson, right?

1104
01:12:18,793 --> 01:12:20,712
-I do.
-How do you know her?

1105
01:12:20,795 --> 01:12:21,795
We're good friends.

1106
01:12:21,838 --> 01:12:23,798
Okay. Do you know
where she is right now?

1107
01:12:23,882 --> 01:12:25,050
I'm not sure.

1108
01:12:26,134 --> 01:12:27,814
When's the last time
you saw her?

1109
01:12:28,344 --> 01:12:30,680
Uh, I saw her at the dance.

1110
01:12:31,473 --> 01:12:33,141
Before you guys came in
to the dance.

1111
01:12:34,642 --> 01:12:35,935
What's her number?

1112
01:12:36,019 --> 01:12:37,187
She doesn't have a phone.

1113
01:12:38,855 --> 01:12:40,356
Her dad doesn't let her, so...

1114
01:12:40,857 --> 01:12:43,109
The only high school girl
in America,

1115
01:12:43,193 --> 01:12:45,195
Willa Ferguson,
doesn't have a phone.

1116
01:12:46,613 --> 01:12:47,697
I guess so.

1117
01:12:59,876 --> 01:13:01,645
Alpha Two,
I need a residential address

1118
01:13:01,669 --> 01:13:03,379
for a Sergio St. Carlos.

1119
01:13:08,760 --> 01:13:09,761
What is it?

1120
01:13:10,595 --> 01:13:11,721
It's an old tracking device.

1121
01:13:11,805 --> 01:13:14,182
It goes off
when it's within 100 yards of hers,

1122
01:13:14,265 --> 01:13:16,684
if it works. And it never works.

1123
01:13:16,768 --> 01:13:18,686
Sometimes it does,
but mostly it doesn't.

1124
01:13:19,395 --> 01:13:20,647
What about her phone?

1125
01:13:21,523 --> 01:13:22,774
She doesn't have a phone.

1126
01:13:27,612 --> 01:13:29,781
-What, she has a phone?
-Yes.

1127
01:13:30,657 --> 01:13:32,408
She's on... You have
her phone number, man?

1128
01:13:32,492 --> 01:13:34,619
No. Everybody knows
she has a phone, though.

1129
01:13:34,702 --> 01:13:35,805
Everybody knows she has a...

1130
01:13:35,829 --> 01:13:37,349
Why didn't she tell me
she has a phone?

1131
01:13:37,413 --> 01:13:38,682
Maybe she didn't want you
to get mad.

1132
01:13:38,706 --> 01:13:40,346
She's not allowed
to have a goddamn phone!

1133
01:13:40,416 --> 01:13:42,061
Well, maybe she didn't
want you to get mad.

1134
01:13:42,085 --> 01:13:45,296
I don't get mad. I don't get mad
about anything anymore.

1135
01:13:51,094 --> 01:13:52,094
Scared?

1136
01:13:54,222 --> 01:13:55,974
-No.
-No?

1137
01:13:56,391 --> 01:13:57,600
Well, you should be.

1138
01:13:59,811 --> 01:14:01,855
Your dad ever mention Steve Lockjaw?

1139
01:14:05,400 --> 01:14:06,400
Yeah.

1140
01:14:06,442 --> 01:14:07,569
Yeah?

1141
01:14:09,904 --> 01:14:11,114
What'd he tell you?

1142
01:14:11,948 --> 01:14:13,616
He's the one who killed my mom.

1143
01:14:45,982 --> 01:14:47,609
Let's fight fire with fire.

1144
01:14:47,692 --> 01:14:48,860
Roger that.

1145
01:14:49,611 --> 01:14:51,529
Net call,
send in Eddie Van Halen.

1146
01:15:19,140 --> 01:15:20,660
Personnel ready!

1147
01:15:22,894 --> 01:15:24,354
Gas, gas, gas!

1148
01:15:34,489 --> 01:15:35,740
Forward, move!

1149
01:15:40,036 --> 01:15:41,329
Oh, my God.

1150
01:15:48,878 --> 01:15:50,046
BeeGee!

1151
01:15:53,341 --> 01:15:54,526
What's the word?

1152
01:15:54,550 --> 01:15:56,844
It's fuckin' World War III
out there, yo!

1153
01:15:59,472 --> 01:16:01,152
Meet me at Genesis,
right now.

1154
01:16:07,397 --> 01:16:09,357
They're with me. Okay?

1155
01:16:09,440 --> 01:16:12,151
Help him bring everything inside,
then meet me upstairs.

1156
01:16:12,235 --> 01:16:13,152
Don't get locked out!

1157
01:16:15,571 --> 01:16:18,157
Oh! Everybody.
The store is closed.

1158
01:16:18,241 --> 01:16:19,534
Help! Go help. Come on.

1159
01:16:19,617 --> 01:16:21,095
-You got a charger, homie?
-Let's go, give a hand.

1160
01:16:21,119 --> 01:16:22,721
-Come on. We're closing.
-Thank you. You speak English!

1161
01:16:22,745 --> 01:16:24,025
-Thank you, bro.
-Hey.

1162
01:16:24,622 --> 01:16:27,333
We got 20 minutes
to get everybody to the church. Okay?

1163
01:16:27,417 --> 01:16:28,417
Okay.

1164
01:16:29,294 --> 01:16:31,254
-I need your help. Okay?
-Okay.

1165
01:16:31,337 --> 01:16:33,423
I need you to go upstairs
and do me a favor.

1166
01:16:33,506 --> 01:16:35,651
I know you don't like the tunnel.
You're gonna have to come with me.

1167
01:16:35,675 --> 01:16:37,444
-Okay. Okay.
-Go upstairs, give 'em a hand. Yeah.

1168
01:16:37,468 --> 01:16:39,971
Esteban! Esteban,
get off your phone. <i>Ándale.</i>

1169
01:16:40,054 --> 01:16:42,557
Come to the front of the store
and keep an eye on the store.

1170
01:16:42,640 --> 01:16:44,434
-Esteban, <i>vámonos</i>!
-Hey, get off the phone!

1171
01:16:44,517 --> 01:16:47,186
-Get off the phone! Come on!
-I'm not on the phone, man!

1172
01:16:47,270 --> 01:16:48,438
God damn!

1173
01:16:48,521 --> 01:16:50,023
I'm trying to charge the phone!

1174
01:16:50,106 --> 01:16:51,375
-You see that?
-Bring it upstairs.

1175
01:16:51,399 --> 01:16:53,399
-Goddamn, man!
-Bring it upstairs.

1176
01:17:20,595 --> 01:17:22,805
Guys, clean it up.
Spick-and-span.

1177
01:17:23,639 --> 01:17:25,016
Bob.

1178
01:17:25,099 --> 01:17:26,809
Not safe for you there.
Follow me.

1179
01:17:29,395 --> 01:17:31,939
Derrick, line 'em up in the hallway!

1180
01:17:32,023 --> 01:17:34,275
I'll be in 24!

1181
01:17:40,365 --> 01:17:42,551
You win some
and you lose some, Bob.

1182
01:17:42,575 --> 01:17:44,327
-Yeah.
-Bob, Bob, Bob.

1183
01:17:44,410 --> 01:17:45,578
Get back on defense.

1184
01:17:45,661 --> 01:17:47,747
-Back on defense, man, yeah.
-Yeah.

1185
01:17:48,831 --> 01:17:50,271
Thank you, man.
Thank you, thank you.

1186
01:17:51,250 --> 01:17:52,251
Here.

1187
01:17:53,252 --> 01:17:55,012
Do it in my room.
It's more privacy.

1188
01:17:55,296 --> 01:17:57,924
Aubrey, get off the phones.
Go to the second floor.

1189
01:17:58,549 --> 01:17:59,902
-We're moving them out.
-Where's your room?

1190
01:17:59,926 --> 01:18:00,944
-Okay?
-Back here, man?

1191
01:18:00,968 --> 01:18:02,154
-Hey, Bob, Bob.
-Back here?

1192
01:18:02,178 --> 01:18:03,513
-Yeah?
-This is everybody.

1193
01:18:03,596 --> 01:18:05,306
-Yeah. Hi.
-Everybody, this is Bob.

1194
01:18:05,390 --> 01:18:07,141
-Hello, Bob.
-The Gringo Zapata.

1195
01:18:07,225 --> 01:18:08,518
Everyone, say hello.

1196
01:18:08,601 --> 01:18:10,103
-Okay. Jacob...
-Right on, man.

1197
01:18:10,186 --> 01:18:11,497
I need you to go
to the second floor.

1198
01:18:11,521 --> 01:18:12,939
Marisela, we're moving them out.

1199
01:18:13,022 --> 01:18:14,065
-What?
-Now, now.

1200
01:18:14,148 --> 01:18:16,943
Yeah. Bob, Bob. Bob.
This is Rachel.

1201
01:18:17,026 --> 01:18:18,587

01:18:21,989 --> 01:18:23,675
-Hey, is it back there?
-Okay. Yeah. Back here.

1205
01:18:23,699 --> 01:18:25,410
Thank you. Nice to meet you.

1206
01:18:25,493 --> 01:18:26,911
Right here.
Right behind the couch.

1207
01:18:26,994 --> 01:18:28,287
Thank you, brother, thank you.

1208
01:18:28,371 --> 01:18:30,706
Mariah. Madison. Come on.

1209
01:18:31,999 --> 01:18:33,167
-Out.
-Got it.

1210
01:18:33,251 --> 01:18:34,293
Come on, it's my room.

1211
01:18:34,377 --> 01:18:36,337
Thank you, girls.

1212
01:18:37,255 --> 01:18:39,298
Yeah. Come on.

1213
01:18:40,049 --> 01:18:41,050
Come on.

1214
01:18:46,973 --> 01:18:47,973
Shit.

1215
01:18:51,978 --> 01:18:52,978
Sorry, man.

1216
01:18:53,563 --> 01:18:54,605
Come on.

1217
01:18:54,689 --> 01:18:55,689
It's okay.

1218
01:18:56,566 --> 01:18:58,293
Come on, baby.
Come on, baby. Come on, baby.

1219
01:18:58,317 --> 01:19:00,695
Come on, baby. Come on, baby.
Come on, baby.

1220
01:19:03,698 --> 01:19:05,992
I got power. I got power.

1221
01:19:14,625 --> 01:19:16,065
Please, please, please.

1222
01:19:17,920 --> 01:19:19,022
<i>"Rise and shine."</i>

1223
01:19:19,046 --> 01:19:21,132
Hi. What's up?

1224
01:19:21,883 --> 01:19:24,969
What's up, homie?
It's me again. Bob Ferguson.

1225
01:19:25,595 --> 01:19:29,182
I don't know if you remember,
but we spoke earlier on the phone.

1226
01:19:29,265 --> 01:19:32,185
I think we had
a little misunderstanding.

1227
01:19:32,268 --> 01:19:34,020
I think we got off
on the wrong foot.

1228
01:19:34,103 --> 01:19:37,565
I was trying to get the rendezvous point
for my daughter. Willa.

1229
01:19:37,648 --> 01:19:40,693
<i>Right. If you can't answer
"What time is it?"</i>

1230
01:19:40,776 --> 01:19:43,321
<i>I cannot give you
the rendezvous point.</i>

1231
01:19:43,404 --> 01:19:44,756
<i>This is a key tenet
of the rebellion text.</i>

1232
01:19:44,780 --> 01:19:47,050
-"What time is it?"
<i>-I'm surprised you can't name it.</i>

1233
01:19:47,074 --> 01:19:48,719
<i>I don't know if you are...</i>

1234
01:19:48,743 --> 01:19:49,827
<i>who you say you are.</i>

1235
01:19:49,911 --> 01:19:51,454
Okay.

1236
01:19:51,537 --> 01:19:52,830
Well, look, look, maybe I can...

1237
01:19:53,331 --> 01:19:54,683
Maybe I can give you
some information

1238
01:19:54,707 --> 01:19:56,627
and then you give me
some information, all right?

1239
01:19:56,709 --> 01:19:58,437
We'll just share
a little bit of information.

1240
01:19:58,461 --> 01:19:59,504
My name is Bob Ferguson.

1241
01:19:59,587 --> 01:20:01,023
I don't know if you've ever
heard of me. All right?

1242
01:20:01,047 --> 01:20:04,425
I was a part of French 75 for years.
Years and years, all right?

1243
01:20:04,509 --> 01:20:07,762
They used to call me "Ghetto Pat,"
"Rocket Man," something like that.

1244
01:20:09,013 --> 01:20:10,806
Only problem is, I, uh...

1245
01:20:11,349 --> 01:20:13,935
I fried my brain since then, man.

1246
01:20:14,018 --> 01:20:16,729
I have abused drugs and alcohol

1247
01:20:17,230 --> 01:20:19,273
for the past 30 years, man.

1248
01:20:19,357 --> 01:20:21,651
I'm a drug and alcohol lover

1249
01:20:21,734 --> 01:20:24,904
and I cannot remember
for the life of me,

1250
01:20:24,987 --> 01:20:27,156
or the life of my only child,

1251
01:20:27,240 --> 01:20:30,034
the answer to your question,
"What time is it?"

1252
01:20:30,660 --> 01:20:31,827
8:15.

1253
01:20:31,911 --> 01:20:34,247
Now, I need
this rendezvous point,

1254
01:20:34,330 --> 01:20:35,665
you understand what I'm sayin'?

1255
01:20:35,748 --> 01:20:37,583
-I need it.
<i>-I understand.</i>

1256
01:20:37,667 --> 01:20:39,585
<i>-And the question is...</i>
-Fuck!

1257
01:20:39,669 --> 01:20:41,087
<i>"What time is it?"</i>

1258
01:20:42,171 --> 01:20:43,774
If you don't give me
the rendezvous point,

1259
01:20:43,798 --> 01:20:45,841
I swear to God,
I will hunt you down

1260
01:20:45,925 --> 01:20:48,928
and stick a loaded
fuckin' hot piece of dynamite

1261
01:20:49,011 --> 01:20:50,513
right up your fuckin' asshole.

1262
01:20:51,973 --> 01:20:55,059
<i>Okay, this doesn't feel safe.
You're violating my space right now.</i>

1263
01:20:55,726 --> 01:20:57,287
Violating your space?
Man, come on,

1264
01:20:57,311 --> 01:20:59,031
what kind of revolutionary
are you, brother?

1265
01:20:59,063 --> 01:21:00,207
We're not even
in the same room here.

1266
01:21:00,231 --> 01:21:01,375
We're talkin' on the phone, like men!

1267
01:21:01,399 --> 01:21:02,668
Rachel, let's take the boys outside...

1268
01:21:02,692 --> 01:21:04,086
<i>-Okay, there's no need to shout.</i>
-to the other room.

1269
01:21:04,110 --> 01:21:05,528
<i>This is a violation of my safety.</i>

1270
01:21:05,611 --> 01:21:06,988
<i>These are noise triggers.</i>

1271
01:21:07,071 --> 01:21:08,364
Fuckin' noise triggers.

1272
01:21:08,447 --> 01:21:10,074
Listen, I wanna know somethin'.

1273
01:21:10,157 --> 01:21:12,277
I wanna know one thing
when this is all said and done.

1274
01:21:12,326 --> 01:21:14,996
What is your name?
I need to know your name.

1275
01:21:15,079 --> 01:21:17,248
<i>-My name is Comrade Josh.</i>
-Yeah.

1276
01:21:17,331 --> 01:21:18,207
Comrade Josh.

1277
01:21:18,291 --> 01:21:19,917
Well, get a better name,
Comrade Josh.

1278
01:21:20,001 --> 01:21:23,170
That's a fuckin' ridiculous name
for a revolutionary, first off.

1279
01:21:23,254 --> 01:21:25,131
Second off,
I wanna know your coordinates.

1280
01:21:25,214 --> 01:21:27,758
I wanna know your location
right now. What is it?

1281
01:21:28,759 --> 01:21:31,220
<i>I'm in a secure location,
somewhere between</i>

1282
01:21:31,304 --> 01:21:35,266
<i>the stolen land of the Wabanaki
and the stolen land of the Chumash.</i>

1283
01:21:35,349 --> 01:21:37,435
You're fuckin' intolerable, man.
You are...

1284
01:21:37,518 --> 01:21:40,104
You really know...
you're really intolerable, man.

1285
01:21:40,187 --> 01:21:42,067
This is not the way
the revolutionaries do shit.

1286
01:21:42,148 --> 01:21:43,774
You know how hard
you are to talk to?

1287
01:21:43,858 --> 01:21:46,485
Do you know the information
that I'm trying to give you?

1288
01:21:46,569 --> 01:21:48,487
You're a little nitpicking prick!

1289
01:21:48,571 --> 01:21:50,740
That's what you are,
a little nitpicking prick.

1290
01:21:50,823 --> 01:21:52,867
And you know what I'm gonna do
to nitpicking pricks?

1291
01:21:52,950 --> 01:21:55,328
<i>-Hm.</i>
-I'm gonna call in a Greyhawk Ten.

1292
01:21:56,454 --> 01:21:57,681
<i>You're calling in a Greyhawk Ten?</i>

1293
01:21:57,705 --> 01:21:59,874
I'm callin' in a Greyhawk Ten.
All right?

1294
01:22:00,291 --> 01:22:01,709
I want you to get your supervisor

1295
01:22:01,792 --> 01:22:03,645
on the phone right now,
'cause I know you got one.

1296
01:22:03,669 --> 01:22:06,005
I know you got one,
Comrade Josh. All right?

1297
01:22:06,088 --> 01:22:07,923
Yeah, I'm goin' way
over your fuckin' head.

1298
01:22:08,007 --> 01:22:10,176
Way over your head. All right?

1299
01:22:10,259 --> 01:22:12,261
Put your commanding officer
on the phone now.

1300
01:22:12,345 --> 01:22:13,945
<i>Because you're calling in
a Greyhawk Ten?</i>

1301
01:22:13,971 --> 01:22:17,058
I'm callin' in a Greyhawk Ten,
Comrade Josh.

1302
01:22:17,558 --> 01:22:19,644
<i>Please hold.</i>

1303
01:22:20,936 --> 01:22:22,605
Fuckin' prick. I got him.

1304
01:22:22,688 --> 01:22:24,231
I got him right where I want him.

1305
01:22:24,315 --> 01:22:27,068
That's some fucked-up,
nitpickin' shit, Bob.

1306
01:22:27,652 --> 01:22:29,570
He got you on one password.

1307
01:22:29,654 --> 01:22:30,905
Assholes.

1308
01:22:30,988 --> 01:22:31,989
I'm sorry about...

1309
01:22:32,073 --> 01:22:33,425
I brought all this shit
to your door, man.

1310
01:22:33,449 --> 01:22:34,617
I'm sorry about everything.

1311
01:22:37,495 --> 01:22:39,789
We've been laid siege
for hundreds of years.

1312
01:22:39,872 --> 01:22:40,956
You did nothing wrong.

1313
01:22:42,500 --> 01:22:43,668
Don't get selfish.

1314
01:22:45,628 --> 01:22:47,129
Life, man.

1315
01:22:48,005 --> 01:22:49,548
Life!

1316
01:22:49,632 --> 01:22:53,135
Just always some little...
little, tiny detail, right?

1317
01:22:56,347 --> 01:22:58,224
Okay.
Get to the front.

1318
01:22:59,392 --> 01:23:01,394
Jacob! We go!

1319
01:23:01,477 --> 01:23:04,647
Okay, guys.

Alpha One, this is Zulu.

I got a squirter internal
to the target building.

1329

Follow on for Sergio St. Carlos.

Setting up breach time now.
I need two follow-on vehicles.

<i>Yep. Who's this?</i>

Who's this?

1337
01:24:06,417 --> 01:24:07,543
My brother.

1338
01:24:07,626 --> 01:24:09,479
-<i>Who's this?</i>
-It's your man, Talleyrand.

1339
01:24:09,503 --> 01:24:10,503
<i>Talley!</i>

1340
01:24:10,921 --> 01:24:13,257
Talley, my brother.
My brother, you listen, man.

1341
01:24:13,340 --> 01:24:15,634
You gotta help me out, man.
They got Willa.

1342
01:24:15,718 --> 01:24:17,279
You heard they got Willa, right?
I need...

1343
01:24:17,303 --> 01:24:19,221
I need the rendezvous point, now.

1344
01:24:19,305 --> 01:24:21,105
<i>I need you to answer
one question for me, Pat.</i>

1345
01:24:21,140 --> 01:24:23,034
No, no, man. Please don't
make me go through this, man.

1346
01:24:23,058 --> 01:24:24,578
-Pat. Pat. Slow down.
<i>-I don't remember...</i>

1347
01:24:24,602 --> 01:24:25,996
-You're gonna know it.
<i>-Any more of these answers.</i>

1348
01:24:26,020 --> 01:24:27,456
<i>-It's been too many years.</i>
-You're gonna know it.

1349
01:24:27,480 --> 01:24:28,606
<i>Please, please.</i>

1350
01:24:28,689 --> 01:24:31,150
What's my favorite kind of pussy?

1351
01:24:34,487 --> 01:24:35,696
Mexican Hairless.

1352
01:24:36,113 --> 01:24:38,491
Okay. One second.

1353
01:24:39,200 --> 01:24:41,827
You motherfucker.
This is a goddamn war hero.

1354
01:24:43,496 --> 01:24:45,998
Hey, rendezvous
is Sisters of the Brave Beaver.

1355
01:24:46,665 --> 01:24:48,351
Sisters of the Brave Beaver.
I don't know...

1356
01:24:48,375 --> 01:24:49,895
Is that that compound out in the hills?

1357
01:24:49,919 --> 01:24:51,629
I need the coordinates,
exact coordinates.

1358
01:24:51,712 --> 01:24:53,964
Okay, one second.
Tell him how to get there.

1359
01:24:54,048 --> 01:24:55,549
Apologize. Mean it.

1360
01:24:56,842 --> 01:24:57,676
Hello.

1361
01:24:57,760 --> 01:25:00,262
Hi, prick! Give me
the fuckin' coordinates now.

1362
01:25:00,346 --> 01:25:01,573
-<i>Okay.</i>
-Make it snappy!

1363
01:25:01,597 --> 01:25:05,184
<i>Okay. Sister Rochelle's
is located up Old Mission Road...</i>

1364
01:25:05,267 --> 01:25:06,101
Old Mission.

1365
01:25:06,185 --> 01:25:08,425
-Okay, slow down, articulate.
<i>-To Craw Creek Road...</i>

1366
01:25:13,984 --> 01:25:15,144
Bring up the hoolie.

1367
01:25:15,986 --> 01:25:17,530
Sensei! Sensei!

1368
01:25:32,294 --> 01:25:33,855
<i>In the Chupacabra Hills.</i>

1369
01:25:33,879 --> 01:25:35,005
Chupacabra Hills.

1370
01:25:35,089 --> 01:25:37,716
<i>And I just wanna formally say
that I am sorry.</i>

1371
01:25:37,800 --> 01:25:39,400
You wanna formally say
you're sorry, huh?

1372
01:25:39,468 --> 01:25:40,468
<i>Yeah.</i>

1373
01:25:40,511 --> 01:25:43,222
What was the fuckin' password,
by the way, you fuckin' prick?

1374
01:25:43,931 --> 01:25:47,101
"Time doesn't exist,
yet it controls us anyway."

1375
01:25:47,184 --> 01:25:50,062
Fuck you,
you fuckin' moron!

1376
01:25:50,563 --> 01:25:53,607
Fuck you! You obviously
don't have kids, you fuckin' idiot!

1377
01:25:59,530 --> 01:26:01,532
Hey! Man, I got the coordinates.

1378
01:26:01,615 --> 01:26:04,368
It's Old Mission Road to Craw Creek,

1379
01:26:04,451 --> 01:26:05,744
and then to Chupacabra Hills.

1380
01:26:05,828 --> 01:26:07,329
-Time to go, Bob.
-Right, let's go.

1381
01:26:07,413 --> 01:26:08,598
Let's go, I got the coordinates, man.

1382
01:26:08,622 --> 01:26:10,141
-Look out the window, Bob.
-What?

1383
01:26:10,165 --> 01:26:11,852
Be careful.
Look out the window. Be careful.

1384
01:26:11,876 --> 01:26:13,294
Shit. Shit.

1385
01:26:13,377 --> 01:26:15,254
They're here!

1386
01:26:15,337 --> 01:26:17,590
God damn it, they're...
Shit. They're...

1387
01:26:17,673 --> 01:26:20,134
O.G., the store is closed.
The <i>inquilinos</i> are gone.

1388
01:26:20,217 --> 01:26:21,444
If they knock,
you know what to do.

1389
01:26:21,468 --> 01:26:23,804
How'd they find us, man?
How'd they find us?

1390
01:26:23,888 --> 01:26:25,323
I think you were
making too many calls, man.

1391
01:26:25,347 --> 01:26:27,826
I think they traced your call.
They must have traced your calls.

1392
01:26:27,850 --> 01:26:29,643
-What's the plan, man?
-BeeGee!

1393
01:26:29,727 --> 01:26:31,729
-What's the plan?
-I'm thinking.

1394
01:26:31,812 --> 01:26:33,230
-Is that my weapon?
-Hang on.

1395
01:26:33,314 --> 01:26:34,666
-BeeGee! Okay.
-We gotta go, man.

1396
01:26:34,690 --> 01:26:36,191
You're gonna take him up
on the roof,

1397
01:26:36,901 --> 01:26:39,320
across to my car on Lapham's Alley.
Here are my keys.

1398
01:26:39,403 --> 01:26:41,631
You drop him off, you call me.
Latino Heat, come with me!

1399
01:26:41,655 --> 01:26:43,255
No, no, no, man,
I'm not goin' with them.

1400
01:26:44,283 --> 01:26:46,428
No, I'm not goin' with them!
I'm supposed to go with you.

1401
01:26:46,452 --> 01:26:47,912
I need you, brother.
Please, Sensei.

1402
01:26:47,995 --> 01:26:49,038
Sensei, Sensei, please!

1403
01:26:49,121 --> 01:26:51,081
Courage, Bob. Courage.

1404
01:26:52,082 --> 01:26:53,167
That's it?

1405
01:26:54,293 --> 01:26:56,462
Courage. Yeah. Yeah.

1406
01:26:57,671 --> 01:27:00,549
Thank you. Hey!
Thank you, Sensei.

1407
01:27:01,091 --> 01:27:02,551
Thank you, Sensei! Thank you!

1408
01:27:03,218 --> 01:27:04,261
God damn it!

1409
01:27:04,345 --> 01:27:06,013
<i>¡Viva la revolución!</i>

1410
01:27:10,309 --> 01:27:11,352
<i>¡Viva!</i>

1411
01:27:20,986 --> 01:27:22,738
This way, Bob!

1412
01:27:25,449 --> 01:27:26,801
Pass me all your shit, man!

1413
01:27:26,825 --> 01:27:27,701
Here.

1414
01:27:27,785 --> 01:27:29,495
<i>I don't give a shit</i>
<i>what you do.</i>

1415
01:27:29,578 --> 01:27:31,578
I'm gonna need that number
in the next ten seconds.

1416
01:27:31,622 --> 01:27:32,998
I know nothing, sir.

1417
01:27:34,792 --> 01:27:36,043
Do I look like your parent?

1418
01:27:37,044 --> 01:27:38,480
-Kinda.
-Give me the fuckin' number

1419
01:27:38,504 --> 01:27:40,589
or stand up, put your hands
behind your back.

1420
01:27:40,673 --> 01:27:41,816
I don't have her phone number.

1421
01:27:41,840 --> 01:27:43,842
Up. Put your hands
behind your back.

1422
01:27:45,052 --> 01:27:46,929
Cuff him. Get him outta here.

1423
01:27:48,347 --> 01:27:49,390
I have it.

1424
01:27:50,015 --> 01:27:51,225
You have it now?

1425
01:27:52,226 --> 01:27:53,268
What is it?

1426
01:27:55,396 --> 01:27:57,481
I thought you took
AP Common Sense.

1427
01:27:57,564 --> 01:27:58,691
Sit the fuck down.

1428
01:28:00,359 --> 01:28:01,443
What's the number?

1429
01:28:02,611 --> 01:28:03,612
It's under "Hello Kitty."

1430
01:28:10,160 --> 01:28:11,245
Give it to me.

1431
01:28:12,621 --> 01:28:13,872
Give it to me!

1432
01:28:16,542 --> 01:28:18,502
I asked you if you had a phone.

1433
01:28:18,585 --> 01:28:21,046
You looked me in my face,
and you lied.

1434
01:28:22,297 --> 01:28:25,592
I am here to save your fuckin' life.
Do you understand?

1435
01:28:27,511 --> 01:28:28,762
Don't lie to me again.

1436
01:28:34,268 --> 01:28:35,728
Alpha Two's on the horn!

1437
01:28:35,811 --> 01:28:38,772
The female's handset's
heading south on 135.

1438
01:28:47,698 --> 01:28:48,824
Freeze.

1439
01:28:51,326 --> 01:28:52,828
Cell One, Exfil.

1440
01:28:55,622 --> 01:28:56,623
All right.

1441
01:29:20,689 --> 01:29:22,316
Fuck.

1442
01:29:36,955 --> 01:29:39,333
<i>¡Ándale, Bob!</i>
<i>¡Vamos, vamos!</i>

1443
01:30:23,001 --> 01:30:24,813
-BeeGee.

1444
01:30:24,837 --> 01:30:26,922
<i>your guy fell off the roof
and got arrested.</i>

1445
01:30:27,798 --> 01:30:28,882
What the fuck happened?

1446
01:30:29,508 --> 01:30:32,177
<i>He fell 40 feet
and fuckin' fell in a tree, man.</i>

1447
01:30:32,261 --> 01:30:33,971
Chota <i>got him with a Taser.</i>

1448
01:30:34,054 --> 01:30:35,514
And my rifle?

1449
01:30:35,597 --> 01:30:36,598
<i>It's with me.</i>

1450
01:30:36,682 --> 01:30:37,683
Okay.

1451
01:30:38,934 --> 01:30:40,435
Meet me at Sacred Heart.

1452
01:31:38,660 --> 01:31:39,745
Rochelle.

1453
01:31:40,495 --> 01:31:43,582
Well, Deandra,
what new mischief now?

1454
01:31:43,665 --> 01:31:45,709
I have the child
Willa Ferguson.

1455
01:31:46,418 --> 01:31:48,837
This is
Perfidia Beverly Hills' daughter.

1456
01:31:48,921 --> 01:31:52,507
I'm comin' to you in an hour of need
and desperation for safekeeping.

1457
01:32:00,933 --> 01:32:02,434
Unbelievable.

1458
01:32:03,727 --> 01:32:05,020
Do I look just like her?

1459
01:32:05,979 --> 01:32:08,357
No. Not really.

1460
01:32:09,858 --> 01:32:11,777
But you do on the inside.

1461
01:32:12,986 --> 01:32:15,989
Which makes you
quite a risk around here.

1462
01:32:18,158 --> 01:32:22,496
The daughter of a rat
is a baby rat.

1463
01:32:23,997 --> 01:32:25,916
And we must be careful.

1464
01:32:29,378 --> 01:32:30,504
Can you cook?

1465
01:32:32,130 --> 01:32:33,507
Yes.

1466
01:32:33,590 --> 01:32:35,968
We will not allow residence to anyone

1467
01:32:36,051 --> 01:32:41,306
who cannot take responsibility
for both her input and output.

1468
01:32:43,016 --> 01:32:45,185
I can earn what I eat
and secure what I shit,

1469
01:32:45,269 --> 01:32:46,603
if that's what you mean.

1470
01:32:48,605 --> 01:32:50,023
That's what I mean.

1471
01:32:52,234 --> 01:32:55,737
Sister Vox, show Baby Perfidia
to the Pancho Villa room.

1472
01:32:57,072 --> 01:32:58,072
A'ight.

1473
01:32:58,865 --> 01:33:00,617
Let me run shit down to you.

1474
01:33:00,701 --> 01:33:02,536
So you have the towels over here.

1475
01:33:02,619 --> 01:33:04,496
The bathroom is straight through there.

1476
01:33:04,579 --> 01:33:06,748
The pillows is right there,
as you can see.

1477
01:33:06,832 --> 01:33:10,502
And don't ask for the fuckin' Wi-Fi,
'cause we ain't got none.

1478
01:33:10,585 --> 01:33:12,546
Make yourself at home, Goldilocks.

1479
01:33:20,721 --> 01:33:22,097
<i>What does she know?</i>

1480
01:33:23,890 --> 01:33:26,018
<i>She thinks</i>
<i>her mom was a hero.</i>

1481
01:33:27,686 --> 01:33:29,021
<i>And I...</i>

1482
01:33:31,273 --> 01:33:33,442
I didn't have the guts
to tell her the truth.

1483
01:33:36,111 --> 01:33:37,404
I couldn't.

1484
01:33:38,780 --> 01:33:41,491
Perfidia Beverly Hills

1485
01:33:42,159 --> 01:33:46,288
is a problem that keeps on givin'.

1486
01:33:47,164 --> 01:33:51,084
<i>This revolution doesn't need
another one of her runnin' around.</i>

1487
01:33:52,336 --> 01:33:53,837
<i>Shit's hard enough.</i>

1488
01:33:59,176 --> 01:34:02,346
You got more fight in you
than the rest of us, Deandra.

1489
01:34:04,139 --> 01:34:07,184
I got sick of this shit
a long time ago.

1534
01:36:41,880 --> 01:36:44,549
So... what's cookin'?

1535
01:36:45,342 --> 01:36:46,801
How can I help?

1536
01:36:46,885 --> 01:36:48,386
Well, Tim,

1537
01:36:48,470 --> 01:36:51,181
there's this troubling little rumor
we've just heard.

1538
01:36:52,224 --> 01:36:53,475
And we brought you in

1539
01:36:53,558 --> 01:36:54,958
to see if you can help clear it up.

1540
01:36:55,852 --> 01:36:58,039
I'm gonna hand you over to Bill.
He'll give you the details.

1541
01:36:58,063 --> 01:36:59,648
-Over to you, Bill.
-All right.

1542
01:36:59,731 --> 01:37:01,900
Tim, I'm gonna get right to it. Um...

1543
01:37:02,943 --> 01:37:05,070
There's an unconfirmed report

1544
01:37:05,153 --> 01:37:07,364
that Colonel Steven J. Lockjaw

1545
01:37:07,447 --> 01:37:09,950
is the father of a mixed-race child.

1546
01:37:13,662 --> 01:37:15,789
Which mix?

1547
01:37:17,207 --> 01:37:19,834
There's no real easy way
to say this, but...

1548
01:37:21,836 --> 01:37:22,837
Yeah.

1549
01:37:23,588 --> 01:37:24,881
It's Black.

1550
01:37:31,763 --> 01:37:33,223
Well, uh...

1551
01:37:35,433 --> 01:37:38,520
that would be quite the revelation
if it were true.

1552
01:37:40,772 --> 01:37:42,941
Bill, may I ask
what your source is?

1553
01:37:43,608 --> 01:37:47,320
Sure. That's part of
a Double Yankee White background check.

1554
01:37:47,404 --> 01:37:49,906
Some old paperwork turned up
in a computer file

1555
01:37:49,990 --> 01:37:53,493
on the Black militant
named Junglepussy.

1556
01:37:54,286 --> 01:37:58,081
She told an officer
this very story 15 years ago.

1557
01:37:58,540 --> 01:38:00,250
Fifteen years ago.

1558
01:38:00,792 --> 01:38:03,378
It's been there the whole time,
in ancient file.

1559
01:38:03,461 --> 01:38:05,130
Pure luck we caught it.

1560
01:38:06,214 --> 01:38:07,757
So where's the Pussy?

1561
01:38:07,841 --> 01:38:08,967
Oh, she's long dead.

1562
01:38:09,050 --> 01:38:11,553
Oh. No more Pussy.

1563
01:38:11,636 --> 01:38:13,305
Now, a few days ago,

1564
01:38:13,388 --> 01:38:15,307
Lockjaw hired a bounty hunter

1565
01:38:15,390 --> 01:38:18,143
to make a civilian extraction
in El Paso.

1566
01:38:18,852 --> 01:38:21,396
It was led by an Avanti Q.
You know him?

1567
01:38:21,479 --> 01:38:23,523
Yeah, I know Avanti.
He's a good soldier.

1568
01:38:23,857 --> 01:38:24,941
Not great?

1569
01:38:25,400 --> 01:38:27,861
I mean, he's excellent,
but he's not a native son.

1570
01:38:28,278 --> 01:38:30,196
That's his dirty little secret.

1571
01:38:30,280 --> 01:38:31,823
He passes for half-Mexican,

1572
01:38:31,906 --> 01:38:33,783
but he's actually part Comanche

1573
01:38:33,867 --> 01:38:35,493
or, I don't know, Eskimo.

1574
01:38:35,577 --> 01:38:37,329
He's a fantastic tracker.

1575
01:38:38,246 --> 01:38:40,266
He'll tell you how much money
someone had in their pocket

1576
01:38:40,290 --> 01:38:42,584
based on a footprint,
but he is not homegrown,

1577
01:38:42,667 --> 01:38:44,127
so I would not trust it.

1578
01:38:44,210 --> 01:38:45,587
Yeah, well,

1579
01:38:45,670 --> 01:38:49,049
he's apparently good enough
to find what Lockjaw was lookin' for.

1580
01:38:49,132 --> 01:38:50,132
Yeah.

1581
01:38:50,842 --> 01:38:53,261
He found Howard Sommerville.

1582
01:38:54,471 --> 01:38:57,641
Ex-French 75.
He runs an underground railroad,

1583
01:38:58,224 --> 01:39:00,477
bringing illegals
from our southern border

1584
01:39:00,560 --> 01:39:02,270
to Baktan Cross in the north,

1585
01:39:02,354 --> 01:39:04,814
where he set up
a so-called sanctuary city,

1586
01:39:05,315 --> 01:39:08,068
giving jobs and housing
to drug dealers and psychopaths.

1587
01:39:09,110 --> 01:39:10,779
He's also a reefer addict.

1588
01:39:11,279 --> 01:39:13,948
Really? Well, he sounds like
a class act, this guy.

1589
01:39:14,032 --> 01:39:16,284
Next thing we know,
Colonel Lockjaw's mobilized

1590
01:39:16,368 --> 01:39:18,411
his task force into Baktan Cross

1591
01:39:19,037 --> 01:39:23,458
and conducted a Class-A raid
on the Chicken Lickin' Frozen Farm.

1592
01:39:24,125 --> 01:39:26,670
Oh, no. I love their nuggets.

1593
01:39:27,295 --> 01:39:30,006
Well, this could mean
a nugget shortage.

1594
01:39:30,757 --> 01:39:32,634
Not to mention
the Chicken Lickin's owned

1595
01:39:32,717 --> 01:39:34,552
by our fellow Christmas Adventurer,

1596
01:39:34,636 --> 01:39:38,056
Brother Burt Rimhorn,
who wants his wetbacks back to work.

1597
01:39:38,973 --> 01:39:39,808
Next...

1598
01:39:39,891 --> 01:39:41,726
He hit the high school, Tim.

1599
01:39:41,810 --> 01:39:42,977
Yeah.

1600
01:39:43,061 --> 01:39:44,521
The high school.

1601
01:39:45,897 --> 01:39:49,359
And now, all hell's broken loose
on the streets of Baktan Cross.

1602
01:39:49,442 --> 01:39:51,277
And he's turned off
his A-TAK's.

1603
01:39:51,361 --> 01:39:53,255
I'm sorry to interrupt,
but I think I'm pickin' up

1604
01:39:53,279 --> 01:39:54,823
what you gents
are layin' down here.

1605
01:39:54,906 --> 01:39:56,658
This is a curious chain of events.

1606
01:39:57,867 --> 01:40:00,537
So Lockjaw's lookin'
for his half-breed,

1607
01:40:00,620 --> 01:40:03,123
but do we know
where the mama bear is?

1608
01:40:03,206 --> 01:40:04,749
Funny you should ask that.

1609
01:40:07,335 --> 01:40:09,337
Perfidia Beverly Hills.

1610
01:40:09,963 --> 01:40:13,133
Currently M.I.A.
Former French 75.

1611
01:40:13,216 --> 01:40:16,177
She went into witness protection
about 15 years ago,

1612
01:40:16,678 --> 01:40:18,763
only to disappear.

1613
01:40:18,847 --> 01:40:20,306
The arresting agent...

1614
01:40:21,057 --> 01:40:23,268
Colonel Steven J. Lockjaw.

1615
01:40:24,102 --> 01:40:26,980
Agency sightings have her
in Cuba or Algiers,

1616
01:40:27,063 --> 01:40:28,440
depending on the report.

1617
01:40:28,523 --> 01:40:29,566
So...

1618
01:40:30,608 --> 01:40:33,236
not the mothering type,
I take it.

1619
01:40:34,404 --> 01:40:36,948
And they call us the savages.

1620
01:40:38,908 --> 01:40:40,994
Lockjaw got his dick dirty.

1621
01:40:43,580 --> 01:40:45,165
He needs to clean it.

1622
01:40:47,500 --> 01:40:49,502
If he can find this kid,

1623
01:40:50,670 --> 01:40:52,630
he can dispose of the evidence,

1624
01:40:53,923 --> 01:40:56,968
and continue to make fools
out of all of us.

1625
01:41:01,014 --> 01:41:03,016
What would you like me to do, sir?

1626
01:41:06,311 --> 01:41:09,939
Tim, given your expertise
in family cases,

1627
01:41:10,023 --> 01:41:12,066
-we felt that maybe...
-Make it clean.

1628
01:41:15,445 --> 01:41:16,445
Clean?

1629
01:41:17,739 --> 01:41:20,742
We should all be able
to eat off the floor.

1630
01:41:22,744 --> 01:41:24,454
Yeah. It's that clean.

1631
01:41:25,872 --> 01:41:26,956
Yes, sir.

1632
01:41:29,959 --> 01:41:31,252
Well, all right, gents.

1633
01:41:31,920 --> 01:41:33,254
Looks like I'm headed west.

1634
01:41:33,880 --> 01:41:36,299
-And may Saint Nick be with you.
-Ah.

1635
01:41:36,966 --> 01:41:38,968
All hail Saint Nick.

1636
01:42:09,207 --> 01:42:10,959
I have something to ask you, okay?

1637
01:42:13,002 --> 01:42:14,002
'Kay.

1638
01:42:16,548 --> 01:42:18,007
Was she a rat?

1639
01:42:22,887 --> 01:42:24,347
Yeah, she was.

1640
01:42:27,433 --> 01:42:29,519
My dad told me she was a hero.

1641
01:42:31,396 --> 01:42:32,814
Hey, stop banging your head.

1642
01:42:32,897 --> 01:42:35,233
Stop banging your head.

1643
01:42:35,316 --> 01:42:37,610
-Stop banging your head on that.
-Okay.

1644
01:42:37,694 --> 01:42:40,280
-Sir, do you know your last name?
-No.

1645
01:42:40,363 --> 01:42:43,241
What's your last name?

1646
01:42:43,324 --> 01:42:44,826
Batman.

1647
01:42:44,909 --> 01:42:47,109
Okay, come on.
I need to know your real last name.

1648
01:42:47,370 --> 01:42:49,747
Um, Parker. Peter Parker, man.

1649
01:42:49,831 --> 01:42:50,891
-Peter Parker.
-Yeah.

1650
01:42:50,915 --> 01:42:52,184
All right, listen.
This is your last chance.

1651
01:42:52,208 --> 01:42:53,352
If you don't give me
your real last name,

1652
01:42:53,376 --> 01:42:54,520
it's gonna be another charge.
What is it?

1653
01:42:54,544 --> 01:42:56,838
Okay, okay. Stop harassing me,
for God sakes!

1654
01:42:57,964 --> 01:42:59,841
Parker. Jim Parker, man.

1655
01:42:59,924 --> 01:43:01,402
-Your name's Jim Parker?
-Yeah.

1656
01:43:01,426 --> 01:43:03,028
Okay, Jim.
What's your date of birth?

1657
01:43:03,052 --> 01:43:05,179
I'm somewhere in the '80s, man.

1658
01:43:05,263 --> 01:43:06,806
-In the '80s.
-Yeah.

1659
01:43:07,348 --> 01:43:09,183
Let's go. You're up.

1660
01:43:09,267 --> 01:43:10,810
Let's go.

1661
01:43:11,394 --> 01:43:14,981
Get up. Well, fuck.

1662
01:43:18,568 --> 01:43:19,569
Sit down there.

1663
01:43:22,280 --> 01:43:24,198
Mr. Jim Parker,
is that correct?

1664
01:43:24,282 --> 01:43:25,658
Forty-two years old?

1665
01:43:25,742 --> 01:43:28,536
Sir, she's gonna be taking
your vitals behind you, okay?

1666
01:43:29,287 --> 01:43:30,371
Mr. Parker.

1667
01:43:31,122 --> 01:43:32,415
Mr. Parker, over here.

1668
01:43:32,498 --> 01:43:34,250
Do you have any medical problems?

1669
01:43:35,752 --> 01:43:36,854
-Yeah.
-Mr. Parker,

1670
01:43:36,878 --> 01:43:38,087
can you look at me, sir?

1671
01:43:38,880 --> 01:43:41,174
Bob. Can you look at me?

1672
01:43:42,258 --> 01:43:43,509
Are you diabetic?

1673
01:43:44,802 --> 01:43:46,054
Are you diabetic?

1674
01:43:47,472 --> 01:43:48,890
Uh-huh.

1675
01:43:48,973 --> 01:43:50,183
Yeah.

1676
01:43:50,266 --> 01:43:52,268
Did you take your insulin yesterday?

1677
01:43:56,022 --> 01:43:57,607
You know,
if you're a bad <i>hombre,</i>

1678
01:43:57,690 --> 01:44:00,443
you make sure you take your insulin
on a daily basis. Right?

1679
01:44:02,403 --> 01:44:04,006
Officer, we're not gonna
be able to take this one.

1680
01:44:04,030 --> 01:44:05,281
He needs to go out to the ER.

1681
01:44:06,824 --> 01:44:08,076
Thank you, sir.
Have a good day.

1682
01:44:09,202 --> 01:44:10,846
-Hey, how's it goin'?
-Good. How are you?

1683
01:44:10,870 --> 01:44:12,038
Good, thanks.

1684
01:44:13,247 --> 01:44:17,001
Mr. Parker, here's your restroom, okay?

1685
01:44:17,085 --> 01:44:18,419
Let's check your sugar.

1686
01:44:20,505 --> 01:44:22,757
You are gonna go
through the bathroom,

1687
01:44:23,758 --> 01:44:25,426
straight down the hall
to the right

1688
01:44:25,510 --> 01:44:26,844
to the fire escape.

1689
01:44:26,928 --> 01:44:28,012
Right now.

1690
01:44:28,554 --> 01:44:30,264
-Right now?
-Right now.

1691
01:44:33,977 --> 01:44:36,813

01:45:28,865 --> 01:45:31,743
Okay. Not every day
you get to rescue a 75er

1715
01:45:31,826 --> 01:45:33,119
twice in the same day!

1716
01:45:33,202 --> 01:45:34,787
Let's rock and fuckin' roll!

1717
01:45:34,871 --> 01:45:36,122
-Yeah!
-Let's go!

1718
01:45:37,457 --> 01:45:39,917
♪ <i>Ready or not, here I come</i> ♪

1719
01:45:40,001 --> 01:45:42,045
♪ <i>You can't hide</i> ♪

1720
01:45:42,128 --> 01:45:44,672
♪ <i>Gonna love you</i> ♪

1721
01:45:45,339 --> 01:45:48,301
♪ <i>And make you love me...</i> ♪

1722
01:45:48,384 --> 01:45:49,945
-Any more?
-No, sir.

1723
01:45:49,969 --> 01:45:51,387
He's right here.

1724
01:45:51,471 --> 01:45:52,680
Buddha bean.

1725
01:45:54,265 --> 01:45:56,100
Sir, I'm Colonel Steve Lockjaw.

1726
01:45:56,184 --> 01:45:57,477
I'm not to be fucked with.

1727
01:45:57,560 --> 01:45:59,353
You got information for me,
spit it out.

1728
01:46:00,063 --> 01:46:01,981
I saw a car,
a gray van heading north,

1729
01:46:02,065 --> 01:46:03,191
up Craw Creek Road.

1730
01:46:03,274 --> 01:46:05,193
-Carrying?
-Couldn't tell.

1731
01:46:05,276 --> 01:46:07,320
White man driving,
Black girl passenger.

1732
01:46:08,446 --> 01:46:09,447
North.

1733
01:46:12,033 --> 01:46:13,034
What's in these hills?

1734
01:46:13,910 --> 01:46:15,536
Sisters of the Brave Beaver.

1735
01:46:15,620 --> 01:46:16,662
Who are they?

1736
01:46:17,580 --> 01:46:19,332
They grow weed.
They're nuns.

1737
01:46:20,291 --> 01:46:22,627
Is that some kind of sick joke on God?

1738
01:46:22,710 --> 01:46:23,961
I'm not joking.

1739
01:46:25,713 --> 01:46:27,006
How many women?

1740
01:46:27,090 --> 01:46:29,342
I don't know. A bunch.
Ten or 20.

1741
01:46:31,302 --> 01:46:32,303
Weapons?

1742
01:46:33,179 --> 01:46:34,555
I think they're vegetarian.

1743
01:46:38,101 --> 01:46:40,061
Men, let's do what we do.

1744
01:46:41,729 --> 01:46:43,123
Delta-Two,
this is Delta-One.

1745
01:46:43,147 --> 01:46:44,398
We need to pull imagery.

1746
01:46:44,482 --> 01:46:47,068
Mountain chain,
ten kilometers northwest. How copy?

1747
01:47:27,525 --> 01:47:28,985
Hands, hands, hands!

1748
01:47:53,342 --> 01:47:54,594
Dismissed.

1749
01:48:09,483 --> 01:48:10,568
Come closer.

1750
01:49:47,498 --> 01:49:50,251
If this doesn't line up, you'll go free.

1751
01:49:53,838 --> 01:49:55,256
But if it does line up...

1752
01:49:56,882 --> 01:49:58,551
if this is a straight line...

1753
01:49:59,427 --> 01:50:01,178
you got a problem.

1754
01:50:05,474 --> 01:50:06,475
What is it?

1755
01:50:07,268 --> 01:50:08,269
It's your future.

1756
01:50:34,628 --> 01:50:35,963
How old are you now?

1757
01:50:41,344 --> 01:50:42,345
Hm?

1758
01:50:43,304 --> 01:50:46,057
You're 16 or 17.
It's either one of those.

1759
01:50:51,604 --> 01:50:53,105
You have a boyfriend?

1760
01:50:53,189 --> 01:50:54,815
I don't have anything to say to you.

1761
01:50:54,899 --> 01:50:56,376
You're too young
to have a boyfriend,

1762
01:50:56,400 --> 01:50:57,234
so the answer's no.

1763
01:50:57,318 --> 01:50:58,819
Don't answer for me.

1764
01:51:00,112 --> 01:51:01,822
<i>It all makes sense.</i>

1765
01:51:02,406 --> 01:51:04,075
You snag her out of the high school.

1766
01:51:05,785 --> 01:51:08,537
Find her phone. Curb stomp that.

1767
01:51:10,998 --> 01:51:12,958
But then you fumble her
on the 90-yard line

1768
01:51:13,042 --> 01:51:15,503
at some stank-ass nunnery? Mm!

1769
01:51:16,170 --> 01:51:17,546
That's gotta hurt.

1770
01:51:18,923 --> 01:51:20,383
You help me, I'll help you.

1771
01:51:21,675 --> 01:51:23,386
You give me Pat Calhoun...

1772
01:51:24,720 --> 01:51:27,181
the Rocket Man, Ghetto Pat...

1773
01:51:28,224 --> 01:51:30,784
and I'll let you go home,
and I'll let you save that little girl.

1774
01:51:31,435 --> 01:51:33,145
You know she's with the Colonel, right?

1775
01:51:36,273 --> 01:51:37,942
By "home"...

1776
01:51:38,025 --> 01:51:40,027
I do mean federal prison for you.

1777
01:51:49,995 --> 01:51:51,205
Did you rape her?

1778
01:51:56,168 --> 01:51:57,628
Do you think you're my daughter?

1779
01:52:00,423 --> 01:52:01,674
Did you love her?

1780
01:52:03,801 --> 01:52:05,052
Answer me!

1781
01:52:05,136 --> 01:52:06,929
Do you think you're my daughter?

1782
01:52:07,012 --> 01:52:08,532
It doesn't matter what that test says.

1783
01:52:08,556 --> 01:52:10,057
I have a father, and it's not you.

1784
01:52:10,141 --> 01:52:12,701
Is that what you call a father?
He wasn't enough for your mother.

1785
01:52:12,726 --> 01:52:14,145
How's he gonna be enough for you?

1786
01:52:14,770 --> 01:52:15,771
Hm?

1787
01:52:26,198 --> 01:52:27,241
{\an8}<i>Where is he?</i>

1788
01:52:28,367 --> 01:52:30,828
I swear, I don't know. I don't know.

1789
01:52:30,911 --> 01:52:32,264
Deandra,
you know how many people

1790
01:52:32,288 --> 01:52:34,540
sit across from me and swear to God...

1791
01:52:35,791 --> 01:52:37,168
they don't know?

1792
01:52:38,294 --> 01:52:40,014
"I swear to God,
I don't know."

1793
01:52:41,714 --> 01:52:43,799
I swear to God...

1794
01:52:43,883 --> 01:52:47,011
if you do know, we can save that girl.

1795
01:52:47,845 --> 01:52:49,889
The girl didn't do anything,
and I don't know.

1796
01:52:49,972 --> 01:52:51,474
I don't know where he is.

1797
01:52:51,557 --> 01:52:53,910
If I knew where he was, I would
tell you. I don't know where he is.

1798
01:52:53,934 --> 01:52:55,227
What the fuck's wrong with you?

1799
01:52:55,311 --> 01:52:56,437
Where is he?

1800
01:52:56,520 --> 01:52:58,314
Save yourself, go to prison,

1801
01:52:58,397 --> 01:53:01,358
I'll take it to the Colonel,
you save the girl.

1802
01:53:01,442 --> 01:53:03,986
Those are your options.
You're in a lose-lose,

1803
01:53:04,069 --> 01:53:06,489
maybe-save-your-life position.

1804
01:53:13,829 --> 01:53:16,582
You should put on more makeup
to make yourself look better.

1805
01:53:19,293 --> 01:53:22,796
You go to a dance, you make an effort.

1806
01:53:23,589 --> 01:53:25,132
You put on more makeup.

1807
01:53:32,431 --> 01:53:34,308
Why is your shirt so tight?

1808
01:53:41,273 --> 01:53:43,609
I'm not gay,
if that's what you're sayin'.

1809
01:53:43,692 --> 01:53:44,860
I didn't say that.

1810
01:53:44,944 --> 01:53:46,654
I'm not a homosexual.

1811
01:53:46,737 --> 01:53:47,863
I did not say that,

1812
01:53:47,947 --> 01:53:49,698
but I see the lifts in your shoes.

1813
01:53:50,533 --> 01:53:54,495
Oh, you are a smartass.
You... Oh, yeah, yeah.

1814
01:53:54,578 --> 01:53:58,082
You just, you're just a little princess,
aren't you?

1815
01:53:58,165 --> 01:54:00,834
Smart mouth. Like your mother.

1816
01:54:00,918 --> 01:54:03,420
Your mother had a smart mouth,
and I buried her.

1817
01:54:11,679 --> 01:54:14,890
Are you having trouble
remembering what you just read?

1818
01:54:14,974 --> 01:54:16,767
If it's a straight line,
I have a problem.

1819
01:54:16,850 --> 01:54:18,203
If it's not, you have to let me go.

1820
01:54:18,227 --> 01:54:21,187
God, there's no way I'm actually yours,
'cause I can actually fucking read.

1821
01:54:21,230 --> 01:54:23,190
You shut up.
Just shut up!

1822
01:54:23,274 --> 01:54:25,484
You fucking mutt!

1823
01:54:44,545 --> 01:54:45,921
Uh-oh.

1824
01:55:06,066 --> 01:55:07,067
Get my vehicle.

1825
01:55:07,151 --> 01:55:09,028
Put my kid in the car.

1826
01:55:14,199 --> 01:55:17,494
Just never thought this fucker
would come back for us, you know?

1827
01:55:20,039 --> 01:55:22,708
I got lazy, man.
I wasn't payin' attention.

1828
01:55:27,963 --> 01:55:30,174
I thought the person comin'
through that door one day

1829
01:55:30,257 --> 01:55:32,801
was gonna be her mom,
not this fuckin' asshole.

1830
01:55:34,094 --> 01:55:35,262
Hm.

1831
01:55:35,346 --> 01:55:38,557
See her daughter, you know,
she'd teach her girl stuff,

1832
01:55:38,641 --> 01:55:41,894
she'd do her hair, she'd...

1833
01:55:44,313 --> 01:55:45,731
be a mom.

1834
01:55:50,819 --> 01:55:52,696
I can't do her hair, man.

1835
01:55:53,989 --> 01:55:55,157
You know that?

1836
01:55:57,242 --> 01:55:59,036
I don't know how to do her hair right.

1837
01:55:59,119 --> 01:56:00,371
Well...

1838
01:56:05,918 --> 01:56:07,544
Don't go dark on me, Bob.

1839
01:56:12,132 --> 01:56:13,217
I won't.

1840
01:56:14,760 --> 01:56:16,470
I'm here. I'm here.

1841
01:56:18,722 --> 01:56:20,516
Bring it down, bro.

1842
01:56:21,475 --> 01:56:22,726
Motherfucker.

1843
01:56:24,353 --> 01:56:25,187
Here he comes.

1844
01:56:31,860 --> 01:56:33,112
Put this in your backpack.

1845
01:56:46,291 --> 01:56:48,168
Guess this is the end of the line, huh?

1846
01:56:49,878 --> 01:56:51,255
Not for you.

1847
01:56:52,339 --> 01:56:55,634
Ocean waves. Ocean waves.

1848
01:56:58,679 --> 01:57:00,764
I gotta ditch you, Kemosabe.

1849
01:57:00,848 --> 01:57:02,683
-What?
-You gotta hit it on foot.

1850
01:57:02,766 --> 01:57:04,309
-On foot?
-Yeah.

1851
01:57:05,811 --> 01:57:06,937
Here we go.

1852
01:57:07,938 --> 01:57:11,358
I'm gonna turn at this gas station,
I'm gonna slow down,

1853
01:57:11,442 --> 01:57:13,777
and you tuck and roll.
I'll take it from there.

1854
01:57:13,861 --> 01:57:14,903
Unbuckle and get ready.

1855
01:57:14,987 --> 01:57:16,655
-Tuck and roll.
-Yeah.

1856
01:57:16,739 --> 01:57:17,739
Okay.

1857
01:57:18,532 --> 01:57:20,701
-You know what freedom is?
-What?

1858
01:57:21,452 --> 01:57:24,204
No fear.

1859
01:57:24,288 --> 01:57:27,332
Just like Tom fuckin' Cruise.

1860
01:57:29,877 --> 01:57:31,837
Okay. Jump on four. One...

1861
01:57:34,298 --> 01:57:35,424
Two...

1862
01:57:36,300 --> 01:57:37,676
Give me the gun!

1863
01:57:39,678 --> 01:57:41,305
Three...

1864
01:57:41,388 --> 01:57:43,932
Go! Go!

1865
01:57:44,016 --> 01:57:44,892
Four!

1866
01:57:44,975 --> 01:57:46,351
Slow down!

1867
01:57:46,435 --> 01:57:49,104
Go! Four, Bob!

1868
01:57:49,188 --> 01:57:51,023
Go, four!

1869
01:59:21,321 --> 01:59:22,781
Get up! We're leaving.

1870
01:59:32,666 --> 01:59:35,627
Making up for lost time?
Little daddy-daughter games?

1871
01:59:35,711 --> 01:59:37,129
Daddy-daughter games?

1872
01:59:43,010 --> 01:59:45,929
I am a Christmas Adventurer!

1873
01:59:46,013 --> 01:59:47,723
Do you know what that is?

1874
01:59:47,806 --> 01:59:49,099
No!

1875
01:59:49,182 --> 01:59:51,226
I have a higher calling.

1876
01:59:55,397 --> 01:59:59,651
It is a higher honor than having you.

1877
02:00:39,191 --> 02:00:42,069
Contact, contact! 12 o'clock!

1878
02:01:29,533 --> 02:01:31,451
I loved her, in case you were wonderin'.

1879
02:01:34,121 --> 02:01:37,249
Best goddamn-looking witch I ever saw.

1880
02:01:37,332 --> 02:01:38,375
Shut up.

1881
02:01:38,458 --> 02:01:40,043
Yeah, she was possessed.

1882
02:01:40,127 --> 02:01:41,967
-Shut the fuck up.
-She was insane.

1883
02:01:42,004 --> 02:01:43,880
Like you. You have it in you.

1884
02:01:43,964 --> 02:01:45,257
I smelled it from within her,

1885
02:01:45,340 --> 02:01:46,693
and I can smell it from within you.

1886
02:01:46,717 --> 02:01:47,801
She was a fucking rat.

1887
02:01:47,884 --> 02:01:51,513
She was a warrior,
a righteous warrior of freedom!

1888
02:01:51,596 --> 02:01:53,640
And she fought the weak!

1889
02:01:53,724 --> 02:01:55,100
She was a fucking rat!

1890
02:01:55,851 --> 02:01:57,936
Huh? Huh?

1891
02:01:58,020 --> 02:02:00,313
You should respect your mother
and your father both.

1892
02:02:01,565 --> 02:02:03,442
Poke your fuckin' eyes out.

1893
02:03:11,176 --> 02:03:12,385
Avanti.

1894
02:03:13,428 --> 02:03:14,846
How's the bounty business?

1895
02:03:15,972 --> 02:03:17,652
It's all right.
How's it with you?

1896
02:03:18,100 --> 02:03:19,559
Things could be better.

1897
02:03:19,643 --> 02:03:22,020
It's not one thing,
it's a-fuckin'-nother.

1898
02:03:22,104 --> 02:03:23,563
Do you find that to be true?

1899
02:03:25,649 --> 02:03:26,983
Anyway...

1900
02:03:27,859 --> 02:03:29,694
I need to dispose of this one.

1901
02:03:31,279 --> 02:03:32,364
Who is it?

1902
02:03:32,447 --> 02:03:34,616
Murder suspect. Wetback half-breed.

1903
02:03:34,699 --> 02:03:37,327
Involved in narco cartels.
Nobody that will be missed.

1904
02:03:38,286 --> 02:03:39,913
That's a kid. I don't do kids.

1905
02:03:39,996 --> 02:03:41,206
Kids do bad shit.

1906
02:03:42,833 --> 02:03:43,708
Why don't you do it?

1907
02:03:43,792 --> 02:03:45,460
I can't do it. I'm busy.
So who can do it?

1908
02:03:45,544 --> 02:03:46,837
Well, get Erik Garrow to do it.

1909
02:03:46,920 --> 02:03:48,106
I don't want Erik Garrow to do it.

1910
02:03:48,130 --> 02:03:50,066
I'll pay you double your daily rate,
get this done.

1911
02:03:50,090 --> 02:03:52,050
I don't give a shit. I'm not doin' it.

1912
02:03:52,134 --> 02:03:53,218
All right.

1913
02:03:54,970 --> 02:03:56,763
You know the 1776,

1914
02:03:56,847 --> 02:03:58,927
about five miles outside Del Rio
by Walter's Landing?

1915
02:03:58,974 --> 02:04:00,142
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

1916
02:04:00,225 --> 02:04:02,352
You get her to them,
I'll pay you your daily rate.

1917
02:04:22,497 --> 02:04:23,623
Smart aleck.

1918
02:04:52,360 --> 02:04:54,905
You got no manners, God damn it!

1919
02:04:55,822 --> 02:04:57,532
You weren't raised right!

1920
02:04:59,284 --> 02:05:00,869
You see that?!

1921
02:05:00,952 --> 02:05:02,245
You see that?!

1922
02:05:03,997 --> 02:05:05,665
That's what your mother brought up.

1923
02:05:09,753 --> 02:05:12,130
Get... there.

1924
02:05:12,214 --> 02:05:14,132
Kick all the way.
Yeah, go ahead, kick!

1925
02:05:14,216 --> 02:05:16,384
Kick, kick!

1926
02:05:16,468 --> 02:05:18,428
I'm sorry it had to end this way.

1927
02:05:18,511 --> 02:05:21,765
If you had any manners,
we might have gotten to know each other.

1928
02:05:36,488 --> 02:05:38,031
Little bitch child.

1929
02:05:38,865 --> 02:05:40,242
Bitch child.

1930
02:05:41,785 --> 02:05:43,036
All goddamn witches...

1931
02:05:47,082 --> 02:05:50,335
Where the fuck
are you taking me, asshole?

1932
02:05:51,253 --> 02:05:53,338
Someone gonna come by lookin' for you?

1933
02:05:55,840 --> 02:05:58,843
I said, is someone gonna
come by lookin' for you?

1934
02:06:00,887 --> 02:06:02,097
Yeah.

1935
02:06:03,348 --> 02:06:06,268
They're gonna find me,
and they're gonna fuck you up.

1936
02:06:15,193 --> 02:06:17,279
Fuck, fuck, fuck. Come on.

1937
02:06:18,530 --> 02:06:21,032
Fuck! Fuck!

1938
02:06:29,541 --> 02:06:32,836
<i>Hola, hola.</i>

1939
02:06:53,648 --> 02:06:54,941
Head.

1940
02:07:02,991 --> 02:07:05,410
All right, lift your shirt
and turn around.

1941
02:07:07,620 --> 02:07:09,289
Put your hands on top of your head.

1942
02:07:11,541 --> 02:07:13,001
All right, let's go to work.

1943
02:07:14,586 --> 02:07:16,826
Do not move.
Do you have any weapons on you, sir?

1944
02:07:16,880 --> 02:07:18,089
No, sir.

1945
02:07:18,173 --> 02:07:19,549
Why are you running from us?

1946
02:07:20,717 --> 02:07:22,218
Had a long day, ma'am.

1947
02:07:22,302 --> 02:07:23,696
You didn't see the lights back there?

1948
02:07:23,720 --> 02:07:24,804
Yes, I did.

1949
02:07:24,888 --> 02:07:26,639
What did you toss out of the vehicle?

1950
02:07:26,723 --> 02:07:27,723
'Scuse me?

1951
02:07:27,766 --> 02:07:29,966
What did you toss
out of the vehicle back there?

1952
02:07:30,477 --> 02:07:32,479
-Trash.
-You sure about that?

1953
02:07:32,562 --> 02:07:33,563
Yes, ma'am.

1954
02:07:33,646 --> 02:07:35,148
You been drinking today?

1955
02:07:35,231 --> 02:07:37,359
-I've had a few.
-A few what?

1956
02:07:37,442 --> 02:07:39,277
Few small beers.

1957
02:08:08,014 --> 02:08:09,015
There you are.

1958
02:08:09,849 --> 02:08:11,643
I see you.

1959
02:08:11,726 --> 02:08:12,977
I see you.

1960
02:08:14,646 --> 02:08:16,856
I got you, motherfucker, I got you.

1961
02:08:18,691 --> 02:08:21,903
Faster, you fuckin' piece of shit! Go!

1962
02:08:34,624 --> 02:08:35,959
Who's this asshole?

1963
02:08:38,837 --> 02:08:40,046
What do you want?

1964
02:09:33,892 --> 02:09:35,059
Is that from Lockjaw?

1965
02:09:49,908 --> 02:09:51,201
We got a body.

1966
02:09:55,997 --> 02:09:57,373
<i>Copy, copy.</i>

1967
02:10:01,294 --> 02:10:02,754
Thanks, wagon-burner.

1968
02:10:37,413 --> 02:10:38,957
Fuck.

1969
02:10:41,960 --> 02:10:43,294
Fuck.

1970
02:10:44,671 --> 02:10:48,299
Oh, no. No, no, no, no, no, no.

1971
02:10:48,383 --> 02:10:49,717
God damn it.

1972
02:10:52,011 --> 02:10:54,013
Fuck. Fuck!

1973
02:12:49,671 --> 02:12:51,506
Hey, fuckstick, what are ya doin'?

1974
02:12:54,008 --> 02:12:56,219
Hey, Red, I know you hear me.

1975
02:12:57,470 --> 02:12:59,681
That firewater's
got you fuckin' retarded.

1976
02:13:46,477 --> 02:13:47,729
Oh, God.

1977
02:14:15,548 --> 02:14:18,468
"Green Acres, Beverly Hillbillies,

1978
02:14:18,551 --> 02:14:20,136
and Hooterville Junction!

1979
02:14:21,387 --> 02:14:23,556
Green Acres, Beverly Hillbillies,

1980
02:14:23,639 --> 02:14:25,349
and Hooterville Junction!

1981
02:14:27,894 --> 02:14:29,020
"Green..."

1982
02:14:30,521 --> 02:14:31,773
Willa!

1983
02:15:44,512 --> 02:15:45,888
Fuck.

1984
02:16:00,862 --> 02:16:02,655
Please, please. Okay. Okay.

1985
02:19:42,625 --> 02:19:43,626
Fuck!

1986
02:20:07,900 --> 02:20:09,902
"Green Acres,
Beverly Hillbillies,

1987
02:20:09,985 --> 02:20:11,529
and Hooterville Junction!"

1988
02:20:13,989 --> 02:20:14,907
What?!

1989
02:20:14,990 --> 02:20:17,493
"Green Acres,
Beverly Hillbillies,

1990
02:20:17,576 --> 02:20:19,203
and Hooterville Junction!"

1991
02:20:19,286 --> 02:20:20,454
I don't know...

1992
02:20:20,996 --> 02:20:22,596
Say it!

1993
02:21:38,199 --> 02:21:39,366
Willa?

1994
02:21:41,619 --> 02:21:42,536
Willa!

1995
02:21:42,620 --> 02:21:44,097
"Green Acres,
Beverly Hillbillies",

1996
02:21:44,121 --> 02:21:46,016
-and Hooterville Junction!"
-No, no, no, baby, it's me.

1997
02:21:46,040 --> 02:21:46,957
Willa, it's...

1998
02:21:47,041 --> 02:21:49,835
"Green Acres, Beverly Hillbillies,
and Hooterville Junction!"

1999
02:21:49,919 --> 02:21:51,670
Okay! Okay!

2000
02:21:53,005 --> 02:21:54,548
It's your dad, Willa!

2001
02:21:56,634 --> 02:21:59,470
"Will no longer be
so goddamn relevant." Look at me.

2002
02:22:02,431 --> 02:22:03,974
Who are you?

2003
02:22:06,185 --> 02:22:07,519
It's your dad!

2004
02:22:10,105 --> 02:22:11,148
Look at me.

2005
02:22:12,024 --> 02:22:14,401
It's okay. It's okay.

2006
02:22:19,740 --> 02:22:21,533
Are you okay? Are you okay?

2007
02:22:21,617 --> 02:22:24,787
Are you okay?
Come on. Go to the car. Go!

2008
02:22:36,674 --> 02:22:38,175
Let's go. Let's go.

2009
02:22:51,981 --> 02:22:53,274
Oh, my God.

2010
02:22:59,530 --> 02:23:01,490
You're okay now. You're okay.

2011
02:23:47,119 --> 02:23:48,719
Do you know a Black militant

2012
02:23:48,746 --> 02:23:51,165
by the name of Perfidia Beverly Hills?

2013
02:23:51,248 --> 02:23:53,042
-Yes, I do.
-Uh-huh.

2014
02:23:53,125 --> 02:23:56,295
And was she a member of the rebel group
known as the French 75?

2015
02:23:56,378 --> 02:23:58,047
-She was.
-Yeah.

2016
02:24:00,424 --> 02:24:01,717
Colonel Lockjaw...

2017
02:24:03,635 --> 02:24:06,722
did you engage in a romantic
relationship with this woman?

2018
02:24:13,437 --> 02:24:15,314
Gentlemen...

2019
02:24:15,397 --> 02:24:19,443
I have engaged the enemy
face-to-face in battle.

2020
02:24:19,526 --> 02:24:23,781
And in the dark alleys
and shadows of espionage.

2021
02:24:26,742 --> 02:24:30,621
I was once raped in reverse.

2022
02:24:34,041 --> 02:24:35,417
Raped in reverse?

2023
02:24:37,961 --> 02:24:41,965
Could you explain how that might work
for us, Colonel Lockjaw?

2024
02:24:42,049 --> 02:24:45,511
The enemy employed deception.
I was drugged.

2025
02:24:46,720 --> 02:24:48,472
And while unconscious...

2026
02:24:49,932 --> 02:24:52,017
my brain was not working.

2027
02:24:53,477 --> 02:24:56,855
But my power was,
and I believe it was taken advantage of.

2028
02:24:59,149 --> 02:25:00,585
What kind of proof do you have?

2029
02:25:00,609 --> 02:25:02,837
If you were unconscious,
how do you know this to be true?

2030
02:25:02,861 --> 02:25:04,905
I don't know it to be true,
but I suspect it.

2031
02:25:04,988 --> 02:25:07,866
When I awoke, there was sensitivity
in a private place,

2032
02:25:07,950 --> 02:25:10,452
and there was some residue
of an interaction.

2033
02:25:12,329 --> 02:25:13,872
Interaction?

2034
02:25:14,415 --> 02:25:16,166
I believe she was a sperm thief.

2035
02:25:18,877 --> 02:25:20,045
A semen demon.

2036
02:25:20,129 --> 02:25:21,213
That's correct.

2037
02:25:21,296 --> 02:25:22,589
Colonel Lockjaw,

2038
02:25:23,507 --> 02:25:26,802
what would be the purpose
of the enemy raping you in reverse?

2039
02:25:29,179 --> 02:25:31,807
They saw the power of my mind and body.

2040
02:25:32,891 --> 02:25:34,143
They desired it.

2041
02:25:44,903 --> 02:25:46,405
Congratulations, Steve.

2042
02:25:48,782 --> 02:25:50,784
You're a Christmas Adventurer.

2043
02:25:50,868 --> 02:25:53,203
Oh, Mommy. Thank you, sir.

2044
02:25:54,329 --> 02:25:56,665
Let me show you around
southwest headquarters.

2045
02:25:56,748 --> 02:25:58,017
-Sure.
-Should we go for a walk?

2046
02:25:58,041 --> 02:25:59,041
Yes, sir.

2047
02:25:59,084 --> 02:26:02,004
First stop on the tour, your new office.

2048
02:26:02,087 --> 02:26:03,172
Oh, my.

2049
02:26:05,090 --> 02:26:07,217
You know, if I'm being honest, Sandy,

2050
02:26:07,301 --> 02:26:10,012
there was a minute there where
I didn't think I was gonna make it.

2051
02:26:10,095 --> 02:26:12,306
Lockjaw, we're lucky to have you.

2052
02:26:12,389 --> 02:26:14,475
Now, obviously, goes without saying,

2053
02:26:14,558 --> 02:26:17,394
this is just one place
where you can hang your hat,

2054
02:26:17,478 --> 02:26:20,272
take meetings,
stow a few personal items.

2055
02:26:20,355 --> 02:26:23,400
We like our members to feel
they have a home away from home,

2056
02:26:23,484 --> 02:26:24,651
any time, day or night.

2057
02:26:24,735 --> 02:26:26,320
That's a fine idea.

2058
02:26:26,403 --> 02:26:29,781
Now, it's empty right now,
but we'll let you personalize it.

2059
02:26:29,865 --> 02:26:31,867
A man's taste defines him, doesn't it?

2060
02:26:31,950 --> 02:26:33,327
It does indeed, sir.

2061
02:26:33,410 --> 02:26:35,787
And here we are.

2062
02:26:35,871 --> 02:26:37,372
Suite 55.

2063
02:26:40,792 --> 02:26:42,002
Look at that view.

2064
02:26:43,837 --> 02:26:45,130
Would you look at that?

2065
02:26:46,757 --> 02:26:48,383
-May I?
-Absolutely.

2066
02:26:56,016 --> 02:26:58,769
Damn it. I forgot your keys.

2067
02:26:58,852 --> 02:27:00,455
Wait here, I'll just grab 'em
from my office.

2068
02:27:00,479 --> 02:27:01,647
Yes, sir.

2069
02:28:11,717 --> 02:28:14,553
<i>I've been holding on</i>
<i>to something for a while now</i>

2070
02:28:14,636 --> 02:28:16,847
<i>and I wanted to give it to you.</i>

2071
02:28:17,806 --> 02:28:19,057
<i>Okay?</i>

2072
02:28:20,350 --> 02:28:23,103
And I didn't give it
to you before because I...

2073
02:28:24,313 --> 02:28:27,941
I just didn't wanna
expose you to certain stuff.

2074
02:28:28,025 --> 02:28:29,818
You know, I didn't want you to feel...

2075
02:28:31,153 --> 02:28:33,447
sad or confused about it.

2076
02:28:35,699 --> 02:28:37,826
I don't know.
I don't know what I wanted. I wanted...

2077
02:28:38,452 --> 02:28:40,162
I wanted to protect you.

2078
02:28:42,331 --> 02:28:44,499
<i>From all your mom's shit.</i>

2079
02:28:45,334 --> 02:28:47,294
<i>From all my shit.</i>

2080
02:28:48,503 --> 02:28:52,466
<i>I just, I suppose I wanted to be the one</i>

2081
02:28:52,549 --> 02:28:55,135
<i>that you came to for help, right?</i>

2082
02:28:55,218 --> 02:28:56,803
<i>You know, the one,</i>

2083
02:28:57,679 --> 02:29:00,766
<i>the cool dad
that you could say anything to.</i>

2084
02:29:02,768 --> 02:29:05,562
<i>Even though I know that's impossible.</i>

2085
02:29:06,772 --> 02:29:08,482
<i>But I don't want...</i>

2086
02:29:08,565 --> 02:29:12,027
<i>I don't wanna lie to you
about anything anymore.</i>

2087
02:29:15,364 --> 02:29:16,549
And I've been holdin' on to somethin'

2088
02:29:16,573 --> 02:29:19,284
for a couple years now
and I just wanna...

2089
02:29:19,368 --> 02:29:21,203
I just wanna give it to you.

2090
02:29:22,120 --> 02:29:23,789
Okay, I'm gonna share this with you

2091
02:29:23,872 --> 02:29:27,668
and if you wanna see it, you can see it.

2092
02:29:29,002 --> 02:29:30,045
Do you wanna see it?

2093
02:29:30,128 --> 02:29:31,755
I don't know what it is, Dad.

2094
02:29:32,547 --> 02:29:34,424
-You don't know what it is?
-No.

2095
02:29:37,344 --> 02:29:39,471
It's a letter.

2096
02:29:41,348 --> 02:29:42,974
It's a letter from your mom.

2097
02:29:45,602 --> 02:29:47,396
Is it for me or for you?

2098
02:29:52,651 --> 02:29:53,777
It's for you.

2099
02:30:12,462 --> 02:30:13,880
You wanna go read it alone?

2100
02:30:13,964 --> 02:30:15,340
Go ahead.

2101
02:30:29,730 --> 02:30:31,189
<i>Dear Charlene...</i>

2102
02:30:32,190 --> 02:30:34,860
<i>Hello from the other side
of the shadows.</i>

2103
02:30:36,319 --> 02:30:37,529
<i>I don't mean to shock you,</i>

2104
02:30:37,612 --> 02:30:40,240
<i>but I've been contemplatin'
writin' you for a long time.</i>

2105
02:30:41,700 --> 02:30:46,163
<i>I often wake up and I find it
completely crazy how</i>

2106
02:30:46,246 --> 02:30:49,624
<i>and why I am where I am today.</i>

2107
02:30:49,708 --> 02:30:51,960
<i>And disconnected from my family.</i>

2108
02:30:53,879 --> 02:30:55,797
<i>I pretended my whole life.</i>

2109
02:30:57,132 --> 02:30:59,426
<i>I pretended to be strong...</i>

2110
02:30:59,509 --> 02:31:01,344
<i>pretended to be dead.</i>

2111
02:31:03,096 --> 02:31:06,933
<i>Is it too late for us,
after all my lies?</i>

2112
02:31:09,019 --> 02:31:10,437
<i>Are you happy?</i>

2113
02:31:12,147 --> 02:31:13,482
<i>Do you have love?</i>

2114
02:31:15,692 --> 02:31:17,778
<i>What will you do when you get older?</i>

2115
02:31:20,280 --> 02:31:22,741
<i>Will you try to change
the world, like I did?</i>

2116
02:31:24,534 --> 02:31:25,744
<i>We failed.</i>

2117
02:31:27,245 --> 02:31:28,622
<i>But maybe you will not.</i>

2118
02:31:30,373 --> 02:31:32,918
<i>Maybe you will be the one
who puts the world right.</i>

2119
02:31:35,420 --> 02:31:38,340
<i>I think of you every single day...</i>

2120
02:31:38,423 --> 02:31:40,300
<i>every single day.</i>

2121
02:31:41,843 --> 02:31:44,471
<i>And I wish I had been strong
for the both of us.</i>

2122
02:31:46,681 --> 02:31:48,058
<i>I know someday...</i>

2123
02:31:49,142 --> 02:31:51,353
<i>when it's right and it's safe...</i>

2124
02:31:52,395 --> 02:31:53,980
<i>you will find me.</i>

2125
02:31:55,315 --> 02:31:57,359
<i>Please send a kiss to your dad...</i>

2126
02:31:58,527 --> 02:31:59,903
<i>my Ghetto Pat.</i>

2127
02:32:01,238 --> 02:32:04,533
<i>Love, your mom, Perfidia.</i>

2128
02:32:32,727 --> 02:32:35,355
<i>How do I get</i>
<i>this flash to work?</i>

2129
02:32:35,438 --> 02:32:37,566
It's not gettin' my face.

2130
02:32:37,649 --> 02:32:39,109
Huh?

2131
02:32:39,192 --> 02:32:41,486
I don't know how to get it...
to get my face.

2132
02:32:41,570 --> 02:32:44,573
Swipe up,
and then there's a lightning bolt.

2133
02:32:44,656 --> 02:32:47,951
And then on there, it says,
"Flash auto on and off."

2134
02:32:48,034 --> 02:32:48,910
No.

2135
02:32:48,994 --> 02:32:50,954
Well, if you push the...

2136
02:32:51,037 --> 02:32:52,873
There's a little...

2137
02:32:52,956 --> 02:32:55,083
There's a little circle
on the bottom right side.

2138
02:32:55,166 --> 02:32:56,501
Click that.

2139
02:32:56,585 --> 02:32:58,420
Okay. Or take it with the back.

2140
02:32:58,503 --> 02:32:59,838
I guess that's fine.

2141
02:32:59,921 --> 02:33:01,691
-<i>QST, QST.</i>
-I gotta press the circle.

2142
02:33:01,715 --> 02:33:04,676
<i>This is N6EDG,
the Whiskey Sour in Oakland.</i>

2143
02:33:04,759 --> 02:33:07,345
<i>QST signal from
the Whiskey Sour in Oakland.</i>

2144
02:33:07,429 --> 02:33:09,180
Did they say Oakland?

2145
02:33:09,264 --> 02:33:10,891
Yeah.

2146
02:33:10,974 --> 02:33:13,894
<i>Repeat, MKU raids in progress.</i>

2147
02:33:13,977 --> 02:33:16,855
<i>Meeting point for protesters
is Lincoln Park.</i>

2148
02:33:16,938 --> 02:33:19,190
<i>QST, this is the Whiskey Sour.</i>

2149
02:33:19,274 --> 02:33:22,319
<i>All hands on deck. N6EDG.</i>

2150
02:33:22,402 --> 02:33:25,697
You know, Oakland's
a three-and-a-half-hour drive from here.

2151
02:33:25,780 --> 02:33:26,781
Yeah.

2152
02:33:26,865 --> 02:33:28,658
You know that's far, right?

2153
02:33:28,742 --> 02:33:29,951
Well, it's raining out.

2154
02:33:31,411 --> 02:33:32,411
Hey!

2155
02:33:33,622 --> 02:33:34,497
