Here's my buddy, Dima Nifontov, lying.

40
00:03:58,111 --> 00:03:59,694
He died when he was 27.

41
00:04:00,188 --> 00:04:01,688
Missing him?

42
00:04:03,533 --> 00:04:07,009
Just wait, you'll feel it.
Don't be in a hurry.

43
00:04:07,176 --> 00:04:09,826
Let go! Bitch!

44
00:04:10,892 --> 00:04:14,571
Another Dimon lies here. Tereshonok.

45
00:04:14,745 --> 00:04:17,495
He managed only to 26.

46
00:04:17,778 --> 00:04:21,819
And here's my best friend lying.
Kostya Grishkov.

Feel how soft the ground is here.

48
00:04:25,185 --> 00:04:29,371
It's fluffy! Do you want to lie down?

49
00:04:29,805 --> 00:04:33,097

There are twenty guys lying here,
friends of mine...

54
00:04:48,525 --> 00:04:50,396
...none of them survived their thirties.

55
00:04:51,551 --> 00:04:55,093
At least you can be proud of yourself,
you're a centenarian.

56
00:04:56,025 --> 00:04:59,945
They didn't know what they were in
for when they put that shit in their veins.

57
00:05:00,158 --> 00:05:02,283
And you see everything clearly.

58
00:05:02,891 --> 00:05:05,113
I get my wisdom from YouTube.

59
00:05:05,114 --> 00:05:08,237
Do you also want to die
with a syringe in your vein?

60
00:05:09,064 --> 00:05:11,772
No, I want to be like you.

61
00:05:12,445 --> 00:05:16,132
Quietly in my bed, surrounded by
beloved children and grandchildren.

62
00:05:16,488 --> 00:05:19,355
So I didn't bring you here for nothing.

63
00:05:19,356 --> 00:05:21,897
- Let's go.
- I can go myself!

64

91
00:07:07,092 --> 00:07:10,458
- This bag is for you.
- Okay. Oh...

92
00:07:11,134 --> 00:07:14,091
I forgot the keys. Just a sec...

93
00:07:14,092 --> 00:07:16,133
Misha!
Give me the keys from the second half!

94
00:07:16,134 --> 00:07:18,960

99
00:07:33,204 --> 00:07:35,215
We'd better put the car into the garage.

100

I'll do it right now.
Should I take anything?

101
00:07:37,478 --> 00:07:38,951
- Take the bag.

We go barefooted there.

What have you done?

132
00:09:10,483 --> 00:09:13,024
- That's it. -What have you done?
- Are you nuts?

133
00:09:13,717 --> 00:09:15,801

(Gasps)

188
00:11:19,431 --> 00:11:23,424
It's no use. As soon as I leave
the house he goes back to playing.

189
00:11:24,092 --> 00:11:27,763
When mother comes back from the shift,
let her sort it out herself.

190
00:11:28,458 --> 00:11:29,125
(Clatter)

191
00:11:29,509 --> 00:11:32,754
And what about yours? How's he?

192
00:11:33,193 --> 00:11:35,152
I took him to all sorts of clinics.

193
00:11:35,587 --> 00:11:36,153
(Clatter)

194
00:11:37,759 --> 00:11:41,034
I went to all sorts of
witches and healers...

195
00:11:41,731 --> 00:11:47,482
...prayed for him, ME!
Lit the candles. Nothing helps.

196
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:52,886
I only saw him once,
two years ago, at Julia's funeral.

197
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:55,409
- Is that when he started?
- No, he started earlier.

198
00:11:57,492 --> 00:11:59,617
That was what got him down.

199
00:12:00,897 --> 00:12:03,710

200
00:12:03,917 --> 00:12:04,966
In the evening...

201
00:12:05,338 --> 00:12:06,392
(Exhales)

202
00:12:07,764 --> 00:12:10,784
I come home, he's not in.

203
00:12:11,592 --> 00:12:13,169
He's not answering the phone.

204
00:12:15,435 --> 00:12:18,159
Of course, I am up all night and worried.

205
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:22,117
And in the morning...

206
00:12:25,645 --> 00:12:28,792
(Music)

207
00:12:29,866 --> 00:12:31,366
I open the door...

208
00:12:33,681 --> 00:12:36,428
(Exhales)

209
00:12:37,083 --> 00:12:42,166
...and see him lying in the stairwell...
on a rug.

210
00:12:46,333 --> 00:12:47,353
(Sobbing)

211
00:12:48,292 --> 00:12:52,728
Beaten, dirty, like a mangy dog.

212
00:12:53,069 --> 00:12:55,515
(Music)

213
00:12:55,821 --> 00:12:58,821
You know what?
You're right to bring him here.

214
00:12:59,241 --> 00:13:01,575
That's right.
You know, how good our land is.

215
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:02,801
It's healing here.

216
00:13:03,035 --> 00:13:05,196
(Spritz)

217
00:13:05,197 --> 00:13:06,206

(Clatter)

236
00:14:26,217 --> 00:14:27,926
The cops have pinned me down.

237
00:14:28,566 --> 00:14:30,117
- Kidding?
- What is it like here?

238
00:14:30,426 --> 00:14:32,932
Some customs officers make you pay...

239
00:14:33,025 --> 00:14:34,367
...and others catch you.

240
00:14:35,301 --> 00:14:38,426
That’s the system. My turn has come.

241
00:14:39,457 --> 00:14:42,030
Good thing a friend warned
me that they are coming...

242
00:14:43,426 --> 00:14:44,837
...to arrest me on Monday.

243
00:14:44,838 --> 00:14:48,701
- Wait. Arrest where?
- Arrest to prison.

244
00:14:49,217 --> 00:14:52,676
I'll sit out a couple of years,
get some sleep...

245
00:14:53,109 --> 00:14:57,068
...read some books, think about life.
No, that's not discussed.

246
00:14:57,575 --> 00:15:01,325
But I have to break Vova first.

247
00:15:02,626 --> 00:15:06,627
So until they find me,
I'll be in the taiga with him.

248
00:15:07,592 --> 00:15:08,867
Will you help us?

249
00:15:09,634 --> 00:15:13,139
Of course I will!
It hurts you think I wouldn’t!

250
00:15:14,406 --> 00:15:16,739
The potatoes are about to be ready!

251
00:15:17,509 --> 00:15:18,883
Misha, shut that crap down...

252
00:15:18,884 --> 00:15:21,213
...go talk to Uncle Igor,
at least you’ll learn a thing or two.

253
00:15:21,214 --> 00:15:22,918
Dad, 15 minutes more, please.

254
00:15:24,259 --> 00:15:26,675
Mine used to sit at the
computer at night, too.

255
00:15:26,676 --> 00:15:28,266
Then he switched to heroin.

256
00:15:31,770 --> 00:15:32,570
(Clatter)

257
00:15:32,571 --> 00:15:35,612

- Traffic jams, damn them.

00:16:11,598 --> 00:16:14,432
- Let's go look what's there?
- No, thanks.

264
00:16:15,363 --> 00:16:18,330
I'll stay here, near the cars. But you go.

265
00:16:18,604 --> 00:16:20,617
Follow the tracks, you can't go wrong.

268
00:16:41,176 --> 00:16:42,926
There must be two of them.

269
00:16:43,084 --> 00:16:45,334
They went to check the
station in the morning.

270
00:16:45,842 --> 00:16:49,572
And in the evening their bosses told
me there hadn’t been a word from them.

271
00:16:49,573 --> 00:16:51,114
Keep silence for a moment.

Have you found both?

283
00:18:09,689 --> 00:18:10,492
I have.

284
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:15,661
What a creature - he gutted them both!

285
00:18:17,491 --> 00:18:22,571
(Wind Blown)

286
00:18:23,451 --> 00:18:25,284
But there were two wolves, too.

287
00:18:28,101 --> 00:18:30,101
Were they having a party or something?

288
00:18:32,555 --> 00:18:36,180
Strange wolves: attacked during the day,
gutted and abandoned.

289

- We should declare a quarantine.
- Really? Quarantine?

Is that Wuhan?
Rabid wolves don't gather in packs.

291

If these two are rabid, there will be more.

Hi.

296
00:19:15,910 --> 00:19:19,868
- Waiting for me to get up?
- No, just sitting.

298
00:19:23,791 --> 00:19:24,742
Dad...

299
00:19:26,802 --> 00:19:28,722
I've been thinking all night long...

300
00:19:32,497 --> 00:19:33,909
I understood you're right.

301
00:19:35,339 --> 00:19:35,872
(Exhales)

302
00:19:35,873 --> 00:19:38,164
It's great you've brought me here.

303
00:19:39,187 --> 00:19:41,562
I felt it was the right thing to do.

304
00:19:43,016 --> 00:19:45,141
It was like looking into the mirror.

305
00:19:45,597 --> 00:19:47,431
And what did you see there?

306
00:19:48,209 --> 00:19:49,117
Everything...

307
00:19:50,639 --> 00:19:52,139
So much shit...

308
00:19:55,345 --> 00:20:00,512
There was also meanness,
nastiness, hatred...

309
00:20:04,247 --> 00:20:06,372
I won't tell lies any more, dad.

310
00:20:08,622 --> 00:20:14,581
I do want a doze, but I won’t... Honestly.

311
00:20:16,622 --> 00:20:18,122
My word to you.

312
00:20:19,122 --> 00:20:20,622
Great.

313
00:20:22,497 --> 00:20:25,372
- Let's go home.
- Of course, we'll go.

314
00:20:27,331 --> 00:20:29,664
After all the shit goes out of you.

315
00:20:30,331 --> 00:20:32,539
So that you look into
the mirror with joy...

316
00:20:33,805 --> 00:20:35,471
...seeing no shit in it.

317
00:20:37,247 --> 00:20:38,980
And what if it doesn't get out?

318
00:20:41,276 --> 00:20:42,500
I'll beat it out.

Come on, raise your axe and chop.

00:21:00,956 --> 00:21:04,372
- I can't!
- Did I warn you? I did!

326
00:21:04,914 --> 00:21:07,843
- Chop this bloody crap!
- But dad!

327
00:21:07,956 --> 00:21:09,539
Chop it now, I said!

00:21:18,069 --> 00:21:18,663

329
00:21:20,717 --> 00:21:22,403
Why are you pushing on the guy?

330
00:21:24,314 --> 00:21:26,235
I'm gonna come now and
chop your hands off myself.

331
00:21:27,056 --> 00:21:27,925
Now!

332
00:21:28,138 --> 00:21:29,978

333
00:21:30,625 --> 00:21:31,951

- More!

(Sobbing)

335
00:21:33,426 --> 00:21:35,647
More! Come on!

336
00:21:36,364 --> 00:21:40,406
That's right! Well done! Well done!

337
00:21:41,785 --> 00:21:45,160
You, bastard! Bastard!

338
00:21:46,730 --> 00:21:48,313
Now we'll live normally!

339
00:21:50,367 --> 00:21:53,742
- Don't you feel sorry for the boy?
- That'll teach him.

340
00:21:55,182 --> 00:21:57,682
Why are you standing here! Get out!

341
00:21:58,102 --> 00:21:59,685
When are we leaving?

342
00:22:00,741 --> 00:22:02,241
Igor, listen...

343
00:22:03,492 --> 00:22:06,075
Maybe you'd better keep
Vova here for a while, eh?

344
00:22:07,788 --> 00:22:10,274
They say a wolf gutted
someone at the tower last night...

345
00:22:10,275 --> 00:22:13,028
...and they called the cops from the city,
they're now processing...

346
00:22:13,029 --> 00:22:15,221
There's no way to leave the car there now.

347
00:22:18,801 --> 00:22:21,024
Then we have to go
right up to the winter hut.

348
00:22:21,025 --> 00:22:24,066
On your car?
No way, we won't make it, we tried.

349
00:22:26,009 --> 00:22:27,675
Maybe, forget this hut?

350
00:22:27,676 --> 00:22:30,591
The air is clean here too,
the other half is yours!

351
00:22:30,592 --> 00:22:33,557
Nadia is fine with it.
She'll always cook you a hot meal.

352
00:22:34,207 --> 00:22:37,081
No. The snowmobile will take
us straight to the winter hut.

353
00:22:37,082 --> 00:22:39,790
Really? It's over an hour's trip.

354
00:22:40,781 --> 00:22:42,788
It's already thirty below
zero and will be more.

355
00:22:42,789 --> 00:22:46,987
Vova is weak, he won't make it,
the taiga doesn't like the weak.

356
00:22:46,988 --> 00:22:51,122
- I can't wait.
- Igor, don't make a fuss.

357
00:22:52,691 --> 00:22:54,982
Let's wait until morning.

358
00:22:55,830 --> 00:22:57,330
Damn...

359
00:22:58,469 --> 00:23:01,076
Come on, I'll show you how
I got the snowmobile ready.

360
00:23:02,088 --> 00:23:04,914
(Thud)

361
00:23:08,038 --> 00:23:12,122
Got a new track,
straight from Japan, thank you.

362
00:23:12,886 --> 00:23:15,678
The bearings have been changed,
the slides are new.

363
00:23:16,141 --> 00:23:19,188
(Thud)

364

00:24:01,281 --> 00:24:03,076

I'll die without it, do you hear me?

- I won't! Let me go!

00:24:59,747 --> 00:25:02,080
It's a painkiller. You'll feel better.

392

Sure, you can.

401
00:25:20,705 --> 00:25:24,202
I'll go to the shop to buy some
more liquid for a quick start.

402

403

Maybe you have something
more powerful than Ibuprofen?

that all the village will be here.

405

420
00:26:33,096 --> 00:26:38,054

- He still hasn't come back from hunt.

432
00:27:37,038 --> 00:27:39,163
Do you have some strong painkiller?

433
00:27:39,622 --> 00:27:41,455
The back is aching harshly.

434
00:27:42,163 --> 00:27:45,379
Better if it's with codeine.
It's the only thing that helps.

435
00:27:45,380 --> 00:27:47,487
Where should I take it?
I only have paracetamol.

00:34:24,700 --> 00:34:27,532
He killed it there,
then brought outside and put near the body.

543
00:34:27,533 --> 00:34:30,042
- I don't know why.
- Come.

545
00:34:34,969 --> 00:34:37,782
Can we go inside? It's uncomfortable
to write the report outside.

546
00:34:37,783 --> 00:34:39,920
- Yes, go to that half.
- No, we'd better go here.

547
00:34:40,098 --> 00:34:43,142
We'll leave everything as it is there
for the crime investigators from the city.

548
00:34:43,143 --> 00:34:45,592
Otherwise, they'll be resent, okay?

549
00:34:49,278 --> 00:34:50,778
Sure.

- What's that?
- It's my son.

561
00:35:35,194 --> 00:35:38,153
He's a drug addict. He has a withdrawal.

(Gasps)

563
00:35:41,354 --> 00:35:43,240
Is he down there in the
basement or something?

564

I told you, withdrawal...

565
00:35:45,717 --> 00:35:46,617

meet the ambulance, or they'll.

00:36:13,467 --> 00:36:15,409
- And what should we do with him?
- We'll sort it out.

The towel.

580
00:36:51,857 --> 00:36:54,940
Thanks. Thanks. Take me from him.

581
00:36:55,627 --> 00:36:58,043
- Handcuffs.
- Listen, captain. It's my son.

582
00:36:58,044 --> 00:37:00,842
- Don't listen to him. He's nuts.
- Shut up.

583
00:37:02,551 --> 00:37:07,133
I'll now take the heroine
from the pocket and show you.

Lies. He's lying!

585
00:37:11,926 --> 00:37:13,710
I'm waiting until the withdrawal's over.

586
00:37:13,711 --> 00:37:15,714
It's wrong to take him now, do you get it?

587
00:37:15,715 --> 00:37:19,391
He's lying! He's lying! He's sick
in the head, he's just torturing me.

588
00:37:19,926 --> 00:37:22,158
I've been bitten by a wolf! Look! Look!

589

They know how to lie when they want a dose.

590
00:37:24,668 --> 00:37:26,619
- It's a cut from a nail.
- I'll get rabid.

591
00:37:26,620 --> 00:37:28,701
- I have to go to town!
- Okay, enough!

592
00:37:30,077 --> 00:37:31,576
Put the package onto the fridge.

593
00:37:34,444 --> 00:37:36,866
- And take the handcuffs off him.
- You don't get it, Captain.

594
00:37:36,867 --> 00:37:39,092
- It all just looks...
- Take the handcuffs off...

595

- Where to?
- For the key.

600
00:38:07,226 --> 00:38:08,726
I want to save him.

601
00:38:10,958 --> 00:38:13,074
When the wolf attacked,
I hid him in the basement...

602
00:38:13,075 --> 00:38:15,076
...so you wouldn't find him.

603
00:38:15,542 --> 00:38:20,117
That's my son.
If I let him go, I will lose him.

605

606
00:38:27,135 --> 00:38:29,543
Do you understand what 200 000 is here?

607
00:38:30,301 --> 00:38:31,758
That is why I am offering
you two hundred thousand.

608
00:38:31,759 --> 00:38:33,992
Anybody here would sell their
hand for that kind of money.

609
00:38:34,750 --> 00:38:38,116
- Do you know how it hurts?
- Kill the pain. Take it.

610
00:38:38,265 --> 00:38:40,973
If I'd take it... I'd...

611
00:38:45,551 --> 00:38:48,717
- It's wrong to do this to people.
- He does it to all people.

612
00:38:49,467 --> 00:38:52,009
He must be put in prison to understand.

613
00:38:52,111 --> 00:38:55,576
Rare people understand
anything new in prison.

614
00:38:56,216 --> 00:38:58,049
I'll pray for him.

615
00:38:59,292 --> 00:39:03,666
My brother was a drug addict.
I told him: "You'd go cokehead".

616
00:39:03,667 --> 00:39:06,576
He's gone totally stupid.
Is to silly to understand anything.

617
00:39:07,369 --> 00:39:09,244
There's no way to save them.

618
00:39:10,551 --> 00:39:13,010
Just make it so that no one hears him.

Where are you going?

620
00:39:16,342 --> 00:39:17,992
- What are you doing?
- Put the TV on.

621
00:39:18,657 --> 00:39:20,366
Are you selling me to him?

622
00:39:20,587 --> 00:39:23,127

We have another rabid wolf.

Are you breeding them here?
What is the forestry department doing?

629
00:39:41,717 --> 00:39:45,116
- The area should be quarantined.
- That's our forester right there.

630
00:39:45,117 --> 00:39:47,034
Your forester is not doing a good job.

631

- Get people out of here, Captain.
- Yes, sir!

- What was there in the house?
- Wait a bit.

- Yes.

00:40:43,513 --> 00:40:47,034
I went out when I heard dogs bark,
and saw it jumping at our dog...

647

I hardly ran away.

He's a crackhead.

677

That man took a tied up kid
somewhere on a snowmobile.

- Took where?
- To the taiga. Where else?

He's got him right out.
He was yelling! Drunk or something.

693
00:44:25,182 --> 00:44:27,182
Right. You blocked his car.

- At night? To taiga?

they won't make it till morning.

Why not? A great idea.

705
00:45:04,719 --> 00:45:08,127
You'll have a flat, and a car and money.

for real for such a doze.

- We won't, the ice crust is solid.

717
00:45:52,561 --> 00:45:55,844
What a day, and most importantly...

718
00:45:55,845 --> 00:45:58,302
...I promised my wife
I'd be back for dinner.

719
00:45:59,179 --> 00:46:01,595
You've got only five rounds here.

720
00:46:01,596 --> 00:46:04,177
I didn't mean to go to war.

721
00:46:04,344 --> 00:46:07,511
God willing,
there will be no more firing today.

otherwise it can break the window out.

It hasn't got to the skin.

801

- There's no signal here.
- We are going back, aren't we?

802
00:52:02,955 --> 00:52:06,137
- Leaving?
- No. The tyre is blown out.

get you out of here in the light.

- Done.
- What's that?

Is it all contagious around here now?

No, if you don't put your
fingers in your mouth.

What are we gonna do with him?

847
00:54:47,860 --> 00:54:49,126
He'll die soon.

848

One or two days left.

849
00:54:53,388 --> 00:54:57,042
How did he even survive
in this freezing cold?

850
00:54:57,317 --> 00:54:59,317
He's recently stopped stoking.

him for the last three days.

861
00:55:34,051 --> 00:55:37,966
We need to finish the wolf in
the car and get out of here fast.

862
00:55:37,967 --> 00:55:40,355
- Why sit here?
- How? We've got no more rounds.

863
00:55:40,509 --> 00:55:44,983
We'll open the door, it'll jump out,
and we clamp it like this and kill.

864
00:55:44,984 --> 00:55:46,076
And what if it bites?

865
00:55:47,539 --> 00:55:49,404
Look, we'll kill it. We are three.

866
00:55:50,385 --> 00:55:53,426
These two are surely of no help.

867
00:55:55,967 --> 00:55:58,008

868
00:55:58,009 --> 00:55:59,701
...who's holding the door
and who's killing the wolf.

869
00:56:00,092 --> 00:56:01,759
One was enough for me.

870
00:56:02,964 --> 00:56:06,019

He seems to feel better,
he started talking.

It's always so with rabid people.

They seem to feel better before death,
but then... they must lie down.

936
01:00:53,259 --> 01:00:55,133
Maybe we should give him some painkillers?

It won't help.

938
01:00:58,246 --> 01:01:01,204
And maybe give him your drugs?
They're there in the car.

939
01:01:02,507 --> 01:01:06,007
There's a bear somewhere there.
I saw the trails.

940
01:01:06,467 --> 01:01:09,133
So, we now have a bear
for a company, right?

941
01:01:09,134 --> 01:01:11,550
- Yes.
- And how would we kill it?

942
01:01:11,551 --> 01:01:13,366
With a shovel and an axe?

likes them.

And how do you know them?

949
01:01:43,662 --> 01:01:46,454
I wanted to show off when I was 16.

950
01:01:47,069 --> 01:01:49,653
Went hunting the wolf alone.

951
01:01:50,440 --> 01:01:51,940
Why the wolf?

952
01:01:53,247 --> 01:01:57,289
Because wolf is the tzar of the taiga.

953
01:01:57,924 --> 01:02:01,716
While I was aiming at one,
another went behind my back.

954
01:02:02,342 --> 01:02:05,759
I dropped the carbine and climbed a tree.

955
01:02:06,504 --> 01:02:09,796
Tied myself with a rope and waited.

956
01:02:11,069 --> 01:02:13,944
The next day they found
me by the footprints.

(Exhales)

958
01:02:15,608 --> 01:02:19,941
I lost three toes, frost-bitten.

959

I respect any beast in the taiga.

960
01:02:24,235 --> 01:02:27,267
But after that night,
I have a score to settle with the wolves.

961
01:02:27,268 --> 01:02:29,841
- How many have you already killed?
- I haven't counted.

962
01:02:29,842 --> 01:02:33,201
- You have.
- 23.

963
01:02:35,121 --> 01:02:37,204
There're still many wolves in the taiga.

964
01:02:37,884 --> 01:02:38,509

You're a pain in the arse with your drills.

967
01:02:47,259 --> 01:02:50,662
- The master of the taiga...
- Why are you such a piece of shit?

968
01:02:50,663 --> 01:02:54,876
We came here because of damn you,
hell knows why.

969
01:02:55,039 --> 01:02:58,580
You should have declared
quarantine after the first dead.

970
01:02:58,581 --> 01:03:00,410
I do not impose the quarantine...

971
01:03:00,411 --> 01:03:03,107
...but the Region Hunt Management
and the regional administration do.

973
01:03:05,634 --> 01:03:07,453
- But you're a cop.
- So what?

974
01:03:07,454 --> 01:03:10,570
You could have driven through
villages and warned people.

975
01:03:10,571 --> 01:03:13,278
Yes, I could have,
people are my responsibility.

976
01:03:13,636 --> 01:03:17,556
Beasts are your responsibility.
And you seem to be failing.

977
01:03:18,283 --> 01:03:19,731
I see how you cope.

978
01:03:20,490 --> 01:03:22,782
Only when you are given extra money, right?

979
01:03:22,912 --> 01:03:24,857
- What are you...
- Sit down!

980
01:03:26,178 --> 01:03:28,219
Otherwise, I'll break your nose.

981
01:03:33,041 --> 01:03:33,942

984
01:03:44,746 --> 01:03:48,528
I started two years ago.
I can share my experience.

985
01:03:48,529 --> 01:03:52,742
No thanks, I am a moonshine expert.

986
01:03:53,362 --> 01:03:56,642
You know how many moonshine
experts are there around the country?

987
01:03:56,959 --> 01:03:59,750
- And what are you addicted to?
- To money...

988
01:04:00,249 --> 01:04:04,025
Money gives adrenaline.
It's normal for a man. It's not a drug.

989
01:04:04,258 --> 01:04:07,935
- What do you know about drugs?
- They kill people.

990
01:04:08,247 --> 01:04:11,705
- Or make people complete idiots.
- And thus you can handcuff them?

991
01:04:11,706 --> 01:04:13,997
No other variants have been invented yet.

992
01:04:17,701 --> 01:04:20,159
So, you think, it's all so easy, right?

993
01:04:20,544 --> 01:04:23,377
It's easier to stick yourself
with a syringe, of course.

994
01:04:23,650 --> 01:04:26,484
And for us to seek for you,
run after you, catch you...

995
01:04:26,801 --> 01:04:30,324
...beg you, rescue you and then bury you.

Heroin...

1000
01:04:58,727 --> 01:05:00,671
They usually start smoking at first.

1001
01:05:01,676 --> 01:05:04,492
But then the scenario is always the same.

1002
01:05:05,175 --> 01:05:06,188
(Sobbing)

1003
01:05:09,123 --> 01:05:11,263
What are you doing? Put your clothes on.

1004
01:05:12,127 --> 01:05:14,418
Here are the veins of the junkie.

1005
01:05:14,695 --> 01:05:19,367
I'm not super tight yet,
and I only have them here and here.

1006
01:05:20,782 --> 01:05:21,429
(Sighs)

1007
01:05:21,704 --> 01:05:25,037
If there are no veins there already,
you can inject anywhere.

1008
01:05:26,117 --> 01:05:27,617
For example, here.

1009
01:05:28,308 --> 01:05:30,599
Here is also a great place...

1010
01:05:30,981 --> 01:05:33,773
...between your toes and on your hand...

1011
01:05:34,185 --> 01:05:36,017
...you can even go in the head...

1012
01:05:36,018 --> 01:05:38,645
...you can do in the cods...
right under the balls...

1013
01:05:38,910 --> 01:05:43,295
...and if it's really fucked up,
or if they're checking veins...

1014
01:05:44,051 --> 01:05:47,551
...you can do it under the tongue,
right in the mouth...

1015
01:05:48,274 --> 01:05:48,954
(Tongue Clicking)

1016
01:05:52,201 --> 01:05:53,468
(Gasps)

1017
01:05:54,162 --> 01:05:56,704
And you think you can get a junkie...

1018
01:05:56,814 --> 01:06:02,147
...who's willing to stick needles
everywhere to get high to quit?

1019
01:06:09,287 --> 01:06:10,787
Should I give up on you?

1020
01:06:13,488 --> 01:06:17,071
Anybody can be negotiated with,
just not a junkie.

1021
01:06:18,048 --> 01:06:20,131
You should all be locked up.

1022
01:06:20,636 --> 01:06:22,136
Yeah, sure.

1023
01:06:23,384 --> 01:06:24,797
(Gasps)

1024
01:06:25,976 --> 01:06:30,646
In the 1950s there was
an experiment in America.

1025
01:06:31,496 --> 01:06:36,145
Mice were put into a cage and two
trays of water were given to them...

1026
01:06:36,443 --> 01:06:39,715
...one with heroin and
one with clean water.

1027
01:06:40,605 --> 01:06:43,742
After a while, the mice began to
drink only the water with the heroin.

1028
01:06:46,820 --> 01:06:49,904
- It's an addiction.
- Yes, that's what they decided.

1029
01:06:50,417 --> 01:06:53,166
The war on drugs
started all over the world.

1030
01:06:53,167 --> 01:06:54,368
(Sighs)

1031
01:06:56,795 --> 01:07:02,159
Then in the 1980s in Canada, one dude...

1032
01:07:03,092 --> 01:07:06,884
...Bruce Alexander,
got suspicious about this experiment...

1033
01:07:07,536 --> 01:07:09,286
...and decided to do his own.

1034
01:07:10,495 --> 01:07:12,703
He built a park for rats.

1035
01:07:13,008 --> 01:07:17,966
A huge one, with slides,
holes, swings, ponds...

1036
01:07:18,303 --> 01:07:19,288
(Sighs)

1037
01:07:19,289 --> 01:07:21,747
...put 20 rats of both sexes in it...

1038
01:07:22,208 --> 01:07:24,508
...filled the park with
different kinds of food...

1039
01:07:25,121 --> 01:07:28,496
...and put two water trays with
heroin and with clean water.

1040
01:07:30,076 --> 01:07:34,451
The rats tasted the heroin water,
but then didn't drink it;

1041
01:07:36,547 --> 01:07:38,034
they drank the clean water.

1042
01:07:42,110 --> 01:07:44,485
That's how they found
out the heroin was cut!

1043
01:07:46,001 --> 01:07:47,008
(Sighs)

1044
01:07:53,069 --> 01:07:57,530
It turned out that addiction
is related to living conditions...

1045
01:07:58,486 --> 01:08:00,820
...and the way you are treated.

1046
01:08:05,242 --> 01:08:06,909
So, it's all my fault?

1047
01:08:09,842 --> 01:08:12,117
Who cares whose fault it is?

1048
01:08:13,032 --> 01:08:14,990
You don't want to understand anything...

1049
01:08:15,881 --> 01:08:19,172
You don't want to see that it's the system.

1050
01:08:19,173 --> 01:08:21,410
The same system that's putting you away.

1051
01:08:21,411 --> 01:08:25,004
And you're part of the system,
putting me away.

Where did you put them?

1063
01:09:26,003 --> 01:09:29,370

- I'll send it to you to have a look...

- ...when you get normal.
- Put the phone away!

Varya, give me 2000, please!
Varya, are you grudging 2000?

1067
01:09:40,159 --> 01:09:42,086
You see, I feel like shit!

1069
01:09:44,846 --> 01:09:46,327
Where's the money?

1071
01:09:54,184 --> 01:09:56,181
- Where's the money, Varya?

01:24:40,531 --> 01:24:42,614
We'll go together. Let me look.

1257
01:24:46,072 --> 01:24:48,905
Go up through the forest.

1258
01:24:49,416 --> 01:24:52,909
You'll get to the mountain pass there.

1259
01:24:54,484 --> 01:24:56,151
Press it. Press it harder.

1260
01:24:59,031 --> 01:25:00,531

I'll get you there, they'll heal you.

1264
01:25:17,375 --> 01:25:21,951
You'll go alone, otherwise you'll freeze.

1265
01:25:23,338 --> 01:25:24,838
Come on, slowly.

01:25:29,436 --> 01:25:33,019
There was plenty of time before...

1268
01:25:34,669 --> 01:25:37,107
...but I couldn't talk to you.

1269
01:25:39,497 --> 01:25:42,159
And now I wanna talk...

1270
01:25:43,012 --> 01:25:45,918
...but there's no time.

1271
01:25:46,151 --> 01:25:47,831
We'll have enough time.

1278
01:26:41,030 --> 01:26:45,408
Do you remember,
you told me how mother gave birth to me?

1279
01:26:46,217 --> 01:26:47,248
Do you?

1280
01:26:48,517 --> 01:26:49,617
Tell it once more.

1281
01:26:51,538 --> 01:26:54,888
Dad? Can you tell me?

1282
01:26:57,226 --> 01:26:58,893
Okay, I'll do it myself.

1283
01:27:01,447 --> 01:27:03,947
She was giving birth...

1284
01:27:05,629 --> 01:27:08,379
...and you were standing
behind the wall in the hall.

1285
01:27:08,888 --> 01:27:11,347
She'd been screaming
for about four hours...

1286
01:27:11,643 --> 01:27:13,226
...she couldn't give birth.

1287
01:27:13,857 --> 01:27:18,572
And you were giving advice
about breathing or not breathing.

1288
01:27:19,444 --> 01:27:22,777
The doctors wanted to
kill you for that advice.

1289
01:27:23,569 --> 01:27:25,319
And then she said:

1290
01:27:26,812 --> 01:27:29,687
"Bring me a meat pie."

1291
01:27:31,003 --> 01:27:35,795
I'm not going into labor yet,
I'll have a meat pie.

1292
01:27:37,361 --> 01:27:40,652

Can you imagine?

1294
01:27:45,611 --> 01:27:48,236
I was born 4,6 kg.

1295
01:27:48,857 --> 01:27:53,232
My mother knew I had to be
fed because I yelled in bass.

1296
01:27:53,521 --> 01:27:55,188
And I grew up skinny.

1297
01:27:58,874 --> 01:28:00,374
Dad?

1298
01:28:01,638 --> 01:28:04,180
Don't you die, okay?

1299
01:28:06,578 --> 01:28:09,203
I'll never ever take drugs anymore.

1300
01:28:09,905 --> 01:28:11,405
Never.

1301
01:28:12,628 --> 01:28:17,336

But now it's really the last time.

1302

You're kidding, right?

1305

Come on, get up. Get up, dad!

Just a tiny bit to go yet, do you hear?

1307
01:28:46,259 --> 01:28:51,841
Get up, you, bastard!
I'll beat that crap out of you!

Hello, dad.

I won't ask how you're doing.

1324
01:30:45,822 --> 01:30:47,447
You're good, I know.

I stopped taking drugs.

it's time to have a baby.

what to tell you.

01:31:34,570 --> 01:31:36,445
And now it seems I have told everything.

What's he saying about the baby?

1336
01:32:04,227 --> 01:32:05,936
He says it's a great idea.

- Meaning?

Directly.

1340
01:32:17,333 --> 01:32:18,833
Are you nuts?

1341
01:32:19,794 --> 01:32:22,752

somewhere in Thailand or Turkey?
