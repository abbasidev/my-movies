1
00:00:27,528 --> 00:00:29,196
<i>This is a true story.</i>

2
00:00:30,364 --> 00:00:33,158
<i>It happened right here
in my town two years ago.</i>

3
00:00:34,451 --> 00:00:36,954
<i>A lot of people die in a
lot of really weird ways</i>

4
00:00:37,037 --> 00:00:38,330
<i>in this story,</i>

5
00:00:38,413 --> 00:00:39,874
<i>but you're not gonna
find it in the news</i>

6
00:00:39,957 --> 00:00:41,542
<i>or anywhere like that</i>

7
00:00:41,625 --> 00:00:44,754
<i>because the police and the
top people in this town</i>

8
00:00:44,837 --> 00:00:46,130
<i>were, like, so embarrassed</i>

9
00:00:46,213 --> 00:00:47,798
<i>that they weren't
able to solve it</i>

10
00:00:47,881 --> 00:00:49,925
<i>that they covered
everything all up.</i>

11
00:00:51,051 --> 00:00:53,429
<i>But if you come
here and ask anyone,</i>

12
00:00:53,512 --> 00:00:54,764
<i>they'll all tell
you the same thing</i>

13
00:00:54,847 --> 00:00:56,890
<i>that I'm gonna tell you now.</i>

14
00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:00,519
<i>This story starts in my school.</i>

15
00:01:01,979 --> 00:01:03,272
<i>Maybrook Elementary</i>

16
00:01:03,355 --> 00:01:05,649
<i>is kindergarten
through fifth grade.</i>

17
00:01:07,401 --> 00:01:09,069
<i>So this one Wednesday</i>

18
00:01:09,152 --> 00:01:11,864
<i>is like a normal day
for the whole school.</i>

19
00:01:12,698 --> 00:01:15,617
<i>And they had this
teacher who was new.</i>

20
00:01:16,451 --> 00:01:19,121
<i>Her name was Justine Gandy.</i>

21
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:22,875
<i>And on this day, she was
going to her classroom</i>

22
00:01:22,958 --> 00:01:24,543
<i>just like every morning.</i>

23
00:01:25,752 --> 00:01:27,713
<i>But today was different.</i>

24
00:01:28,672 --> 00:01:31,258
<i>Today, none of her
kids were there.</i>

25
00:01:32,676 --> 00:01:35,888
<i>Every other class at that
school had all their kids.</i>

26
00:01:35,971 --> 00:01:39,474
<i>Even the other third grade
Mrs. Belt taught was full.</i>

27
00:01:40,684 --> 00:01:43,937
<i>But Mrs. Gandy's room
was totally empty.</i>

28
00:01:45,564 --> 00:01:48,275
<i>Well, not totally.</i>

29
00:01:49,443 --> 00:01:51,070
<i>There was one boy there.</i>

30
00:01:51,153 --> 00:01:54,156
<i>And his name was Alex Lilly.</i>

31
00:01:54,907 --> 00:01:57,952
<i>And he was the only
kid in the class of 18</i>

32
00:01:58,035 --> 00:01:59,953
<i>that came to school that day.</i>

33
00:02:01,163 --> 00:02:02,539
<i>And do you know why?</i>

34
00:02:03,582 --> 00:02:05,375
<i>He was the only one there</i>

35
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:09,797
<i>because the night before
at 2:17 in the morning,</i>

36
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:13,008
<i>every other kid woke up,</i>

37
00:02:13,091 --> 00:02:14,510
<i>got out of bed,</i>

38
00:02:16,428 --> 00:02:17,846
<i>walked downstairs,</i>

39
00:02:19,306 --> 00:02:21,016
<i>opened the front door,</i>

40
00:02:21,099 --> 00:02:24,520
<i>walked across the front
yard and into the dark.</i>

41
00:02:25,479 --> 00:02:28,941

<i>All the parents and
people at the school</i>

57
00:04:12,211 --> 00:04:14,254
<i>were really sad and upset.</i>

58
00:04:15,589 --> 00:04:18,716
<i>The police could tell
that the kids left at 2:17</i>

59
00:04:19,468 --> 00:04:21,345
<i>because, like, half
the houses had alarms</i>

60
00:04:21,428 --> 00:04:23,764
<i>that got tripped when
they walked outside.</i>

61
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:29,437
<i>Some of the kids
even got videoed</i>

62
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:31,104
<i>by the houses that had cameras.</i>

63
00:04:32,648 --> 00:04:34,400
<i>But the cameras
only showed the kids</i>

64
00:04:34,483 --> 00:04:36,443
<i>walking out into the darkness.</i>

65
00:04:38,445 --> 00:04:40,656
<i>They didn't show where
they went after that.</i>

66
00:04:43,492 --> 00:04:45,494
<i>The police talked to Alex a lot.</i>

67
00:04:47,371 --> 00:04:50,249
<i>They asked him why his
classmates did what they did,</i>

68
00:04:50,332 --> 00:04:52,209
<i>but he told them he didn't know.</i>

69
00:04:53,126 --> 00:04:55,129
<i>They asked him if
there was a plan,</i>

70
00:04:55,212 --> 00:04:57,506
<i>but he said if there
was, he never heard it.</i>

71
00:04:58,715 --> 00:05:00,551
<i>They asked him if
there was a TV show</i>

72
00:05:00,634 --> 00:05:02,427
<i>where someone ran
away like that,</i>

73
00:05:03,428 --> 00:05:05,889
<i>but he said if there
was, he never saw it.</i>

74
00:05:07,641 --> 00:05:10,311
<i>They also talked to Mrs.
Gandy a whole bunch,</i>

75
00:05:10,394 --> 00:05:12,021
<i>but she also didn't
know anything</i>

76
00:05:12,104 --> 00:05:13,355
<i>and couldn't help them.</i>

77
00:05:15,148 --> 00:05:16,275
<i>For almost a whole month,</i>

78
00:05:16,358 --> 00:05:19,319
<i>they kept the school closed
for their big investigation.</i>

79
00:05:21,029 --> 00:05:23,949
<i>But after a while, they had
to open everything back up,</i>

80
00:05:24,032 --> 00:05:27,327
<i>so that the kids that didn't
disappear could learn again.</i>

81
00:05:29,121 --> 00:05:30,831
<i>One night before they did,</i>

82
00:05:30,914 --> 00:05:33,166
<i>they had a big
meeting at the school.</i>

83
00:05:34,042 --> 00:05:35,211
<i>There was a bunch of counselors</i>

84
00:05:35,294 --> 00:05:36,629
<i>and people like that</i>

85
00:05:36,712 --> 00:05:39,173
<i>to help everybody
figure out how to feel</i>

86
00:05:39,256 --> 00:05:41,592
<i>and be sad together, I guess.</i>

87
00:05:44,178 --> 00:05:46,597
<i>This is where the
story really starts.</i>

88
00:05:52,311 --> 00:05:55,356
<i>What's important is that
we don't judge our grief.</i>

89
00:05:55,439 --> 00:05:57,900
We might experience
emotions we don't like.

90
00:05:57,983 --> 00:06:00,027
Emotions besides sadness.

91
00:06:00,986 --> 00:06:02,988
We need to make sure
that we allow ourselves

92
00:06:03,071 --> 00:06:05,157
to feel emotions like anger.

93
00:06:06,283 --> 00:06:10,037
Anger is a very healthy
part of the grief cycle.

94
00:06:10,579 --> 00:06:13,415
It can be especially powerful
in instances of abandonment.

95
00:06:13,498 --> 00:06:15,167
Now, there are often
times that we...

96
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:16,710
What does that mean?

97
00:06:16,793 --> 00:06:19,922
"Especially powerful in
instances of abandonment"?

98
00:06:20,005 --> 00:06:22,133
Are you saying that we
should be upset with Matthew?

99
00:06:22,216 --> 00:06:23,509
I'm saying it wouldn't
be abnormal...

100
00:06:23,592 --> 00:06:24,718
I'll tell you right now

101
00:06:24,801 --> 00:06:26,470
that you may call what
happened "abandonment,"

102
00:06:26,553 --> 00:06:28,389
but I don't. I don't
see it like that.

103
00:06:28,472 --> 00:06:31,976
I see something that doesn't
make any sense at all.

104
00:06:32,059 --> 00:06:36,355
We're talking about 17
kids in one classroom.

105
00:06:36,438 --> 00:06:38,190
What happened in that classroom?

106
00:06:38,273 --> 00:06:40,943
Why just her classroom?
Why only hers?

107
00:06:41,026 --> 00:06:42,027
Yeah!

108
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:43,487
Look, I'm picking
up a lot of emotion,

109
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:44,405
and that's fine.

110
00:06:44,488 --> 00:06:45,865
So you'll forgive me if I'm not

111
00:06:45,948 --> 00:06:48,534
particularly interested in
hearing any more out of you.

112
00:06:49,076 --> 00:06:50,744
I wanna hear from Justine Gandy.

113
00:06:50,827 --> 00:06:51,871
Yeah.

114
00:06:51,954 --> 00:06:54,081
She's here. I wanna know exactly

115
00:06:54,164 --> 00:06:56,082
what she was doing in there.

116
00:07:02,673 --> 00:07:03,674
Uh...

117
00:07:05,843 --> 00:07:07,136
I've...

118
00:07:07,219 --> 00:07:08,303
First...

119
00:07:10,097 --> 00:07:15,019
I just wanna say how
very sorry I am for...

120
00:07:15,102 --> 00:07:16,770
all of what's happened.

121
00:07:18,856 --> 00:07:22,860
I know there's nothing I
can say to make this better.

122
00:07:25,779 --> 00:07:27,782
The truth is, is
that I want an answer

123
00:07:27,865 --> 00:07:30,409
just as bad as all of you.

124
00:07:30,492 --> 00:07:32,745
-Finally. Liar!
-That bitch.

125
00:07:32,828 --> 00:07:34,036
I love those kids.

126
00:07:35,122 --> 00:07:36,205
And...

127
00:07:38,542 --> 00:07:39,460
I... I know...

128
00:07:39,543 --> 00:07:41,212
We know you know
exactly what's going on.

129
00:07:41,295 --> 00:07:43,214
I know... I know
it's... it's not...

130
00:07:43,297 --> 00:07:45,631
She should be locked up until
she tells us what happened!

131
00:07:48,093 --> 00:07:50,721
Okay, now that kind of thing
is really not called for.

132
00:07:50,804 --> 00:07:52,139
I'm serious.

133
00:07:52,222 --> 00:07:53,140
Mrs. Gandy is here

134
00:07:53,223 --> 00:07:55,434
as an affected member
of this community,

135
00:07:55,517 --> 00:07:56,644
and she is hurting
just like all of us.

136
00:07:56,727 --> 00:07:58,477
You're either
negligent or complicit!

137
00:08:01,398 --> 00:08:03,734
Where are our
children, Mrs. Gandy?

138
00:08:03,817 --> 00:08:05,903
That's enough. Everybody
needs to give us some space.

139
00:08:05,986 --> 00:08:08,906
Please. Please. It's
been a long, long night.

140
00:08:08,989 --> 00:08:10,241
We need to get some sleep,

141
00:08:10,324 --> 00:08:12,241
wake up tomorrow
with clearer heads.

142
00:08:13,827 --> 00:08:15,538
Do you have anyone you
can stay with tonight?

143
00:08:15,621 --> 00:08:17,039
-Mm-mmm.
-Then I recommend you going

144
00:08:17,122 --> 00:08:18,457
straight home and laying low.

145
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:20,292
This feels like it
could turn in...

146
00:08:36,099 --> 00:08:37,810
Excuse me, ma'am, I'm
saving up for a bus ticket

147
00:08:37,893 --> 00:08:39,519
to see my brother. Do you
have any change on you at all?

148
00:08:39,602 --> 00:08:41,103
No, I'm sorry. Sorry.

149

the night that I...</i>

153
00:09:39,037 --> 00:09:40,539

154

you have any change?

155
00:09:42,165 --> 00:09:43,875
-No, sorry.
-Okay, thank you.

00:12:48,810 --> 00:12:51,772
I, uh... I just need
to work, you know?

177
00:12:51,855 --> 00:12:54,525
I just need to fill
my days with, uh...

178
00:12:56,235 --> 00:12:58,278
Yeah, I... I need to work. So...

179
00:12:58,904 --> 00:13:01,365
Justine, the scene last
night was just proof

180
00:13:01,448 --> 00:13:04,076
that we have a lot of
emotional parents here.

181
00:13:04,701 --> 00:13:05,703
For now, I think it's best

182
00:13:05,786 --> 00:13:08,122
if you keep some
distance from this place

183
00:13:08,205 --> 00:13:11,123
until folks find time
to sort themselves out.

184
00:13:13,669 --> 00:13:14,920
How's Alex? Is he...

185
00:13:15,003 --> 00:13:16,338
Alex is doing well.

186
00:13:16,421 --> 00:13:19,300
He's in Mrs. Belt's class,
and we've been advised

187
00:13:19,383 --> 00:13:20,801
that the best thing
that we can do for him

188
00:13:20,884 --> 00:13:23,220
is keep him on a routine.

189
00:13:23,303 --> 00:13:25,222
Keep his life as
normal as possible.

190
00:13:25,305 --> 00:13:26,891
I would like to speak with him.

191
00:13:26,974 --> 00:13:28,559
We've had this
conversation before.

192
00:13:28,642 --> 00:13:30,102
That's out of the question.

193
00:13:30,185 --> 00:13:31,979
Well, I would... I would
feel so much better

194
00:13:32,062 --> 00:13:33,397
if I could just speak with him.

195
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:34,857
-Right there.
-What?

196
00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:37,359
That's the problem. You'd
feel so much better.

197
00:13:37,442 --> 00:13:39,528
He's been scrutinized
by the press.

198
00:13:39,611 --> 00:13:41,947
He's had investigators
ransack his house.

199
00:13:42,030 --> 00:13:43,699
He's been traumatized.

200
00:13:43,782 --> 00:13:45,951
Let's try and put
Alex first, yes?

201
00:13:46,034 --> 00:13:48,454
If you're implying
that I don't care

202
00:13:48,537 --> 00:13:49,872
about Alex, or the students...

203
00:13:49,955 --> 00:13:52,249
The issue isn't you
caring or not caring.

204
00:13:52,332 --> 00:13:54,543
The issue here is,
you have a pattern

205
00:13:54,626 --> 00:13:56,545
in which you overstep
professional lines

206
00:13:56,628 --> 00:13:58,297
-with the students.
-Oh, my God. Here we go.

207
00:13:58,380 --> 00:13:59,381
You know, I do not overstep.

208
00:13:59,464 --> 00:14:01,801
You know it's not
appropriate to hug students.

209
00:14:01,884 --> 00:14:04,762
Oh, I hugged a crying
little boy. Lock me up.

210
00:14:04,845 --> 00:14:07,807
You know driving students
home is not professional.

211
00:14:07,890 --> 00:14:09,725
What? She missed the bus.
She lived close to me.

212
00:14:09,808 --> 00:14:11,185
-It's not appropriate.
-What...

213
00:14:11,977 --> 00:14:13,813
I know all of this

214
00:14:13,896 --> 00:14:15,689
comes from the
fact that you care.

215
00:14:16,315 --> 00:14:18,651
I know that you aren't
a threat to these kids,

216
00:14:18,734 --> 00:14:20,152
but you have to realize,

217
00:14:20,235 --> 00:14:22,822
you aren't a parent,
you're a teacher.

218
00:14:22,905 --> 00:14:23,948
There's a difference.

219
00:14:24,031 --> 00:14:27,492
And for that reason, no, you
cannot talk to Alex Lilly.

220
00:14:31,705 --> 00:14:32,706
It's just...

221
00:14:34,875 --> 00:14:36,210
We're the only ones left.

222
00:14:43,967 --> 00:14:45,469
-No way.
-Look, look, look.

223
00:15:07,574 --> 00:15:09,368
Yeah, it's really on there, huh?

224
00:15:10,327 --> 00:15:12,788
Yeah, I've been receiving
phone calls as well.

225
00:15:12,871 --> 00:15:14,248
-Threatening ones.
-Oh, yeah?

226
00:15:14,331 --> 00:15:16,917
Think the caller might
be responsible for this?

227
00:15:17,501 --> 00:15:19,879
I-I don't know.
Maybe, maybe not.

228
00:15:19,962 --> 00:15:20,962
Yeah, well...

229
00:15:21,421 --> 00:15:23,715
Whoever it was, the best
we can do is file a report.

230
00:15:24,508 --> 00:15:26,218
Probably kids did
this, if you ask me.

231
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:27,511
I mean...

232
00:15:27,594 --> 00:15:28,804
...hell, I used to
do stuff like this

233
00:15:28,887 --> 00:15:30,222
when I was in school.

234
00:15:30,305 --> 00:15:33,058
You know, TP houses,
ding-dong ditch.

235
00:15:33,141 --> 00:15:34,685
I never wrote "witch"
on a car before,

236
00:15:34,768 --> 00:15:37,520
but a buddy of mine
smeared some of his own...

237
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:54,120
Hey!

238
00:15:55,622 --> 00:15:56,832
Can we hug?

239
00:15:56,915 --> 00:15:59,459
Yeah, of course
we can hug. Jesus.

240
00:16:09,052 --> 00:16:10,429
What happened to
your hand there?

241
00:16:10,512 --> 00:16:13,599
Oh, it was just a stupid
work accident thing.

242
00:16:13,682 --> 00:16:14,766
-Nothing.
-Drink?

243
00:16:15,517 --> 00:16:17,728
-Sure.
-Uh, Tony?

244
00:16:18,812 --> 00:16:19,730
Tony?

245
00:16:19,813 --> 00:16:21,607
Yeah, he'll... he'll
be here in a sec.

246
00:16:21,690 --> 00:16:23,109
-That's fine.
-So...

247
00:16:23,192 --> 00:16:24,484
-Yeah.
-I'm not in a rush.

248
00:16:24,985 --> 00:16:26,529
Um...

249
00:16:26,612 --> 00:16:30,616
Wow. So I... I didn't
expect you to come.

250
00:16:32,326 --> 00:16:34,411
I'm glad you texted. I...

251
00:16:34,494 --> 00:16:37,331
You know, I've been thinking
about you a lot, and, uh...

252
00:16:37,414 --> 00:16:38,499
I wanted to call,

253
00:16:38,582 --> 00:16:41,961
but I didn't know if that
would make things worse or...

254
00:16:42,044 --> 00:16:43,337
-I don't know what's...
-Yeah, well,

255
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:45,631
I'm not some little
delicate flower

256
00:16:45,714 --> 00:16:47,967
that would wilt if I saw
your name pop up on my phone.

257
00:16:48,050 --> 00:16:49,802
-I know. I'm not saying...
-So, yeah.

258
00:16:49,885 --> 00:16:52,805
Uh, Tony. Uh, my
friend wants a drink.

259
00:16:52,888 --> 00:16:54,139
Hi. Hi.

260
00:16:54,765 --> 00:16:57,309
-Uh, yeah. Go ahead.
-How we doing?

261
00:16:57,392 --> 00:16:59,895
Hi. Um, I'll get a Coke.

262
00:17:01,146 --> 00:17:02,856
-A Coke?
-Yep.

263
00:17:05,233 --> 00:17:07,319
Okay, fine. Whatever.

264
00:17:09,154 --> 00:17:10,739
So, what's going
on? How are you?

265
00:17:11,281 --> 00:17:13,534
Well, everybody
thinks I'm a witch.

266
00:17:14,867 --> 00:17:16,120
I don't think that's true.

267
00:17:16,203 --> 00:17:17,663
Go look at my car.

268
00:17:17,746 --> 00:17:20,040
Pfft. I hope you
didn't drive here.

269
00:17:20,582 --> 00:17:22,333
Why do you hope that I didn't...

270
00:17:22,416 --> 00:17:23,961
I hope you didn't
drive here because...

271
00:17:24,044 --> 00:17:25,044
Wait...

272
00:17:26,421 --> 00:17:27,965
Don't be an asshole, Paul.

273
00:17:28,048 --> 00:17:29,049
-I'm not being an asshole.
-Come on.

274
00:17:29,132 --> 00:17:30,134
I'm not being an asshole.

275
00:17:30,217 --> 00:17:31,927
I'm concerned about you, and...

276
00:17:32,010 --> 00:17:33,095
You know what? I don't need...

277
00:17:33,178 --> 00:17:35,765
I don't need your
fucking concern.

278
00:17:35,848 --> 00:17:37,516
Okay? I'm not drunk.

279
00:17:37,599 --> 00:17:39,434
Okay. Got it. I'm sorry.

280
00:17:45,274 --> 00:17:47,693
So what, somebody
vandalized your car?

281
00:17:47,776 --> 00:17:50,070
They wrote "witch"
across it. So, yes.

282
00:17:50,153 --> 00:17:52,740
For your information,
everybody thinks you're...

283
00:17:52,823 --> 00:17:55,034
I'm a witch.

284
00:17:55,117 --> 00:17:56,118
So, yes.

285
00:17:56,201 --> 00:17:57,786
-One Coke.
-Thank you.

286
00:18:05,210 --> 00:18:06,503
Can I give you a little, uh...

287
00:18:07,129 --> 00:18:08,881
-Tough love?
-No.

288
00:18:08,964 --> 00:18:10,341
Just some thoughts from somebody

289
00:18:10,424 --> 00:18:11,842
who knows you very well.

290
00:18:13,886 --> 00:18:16,138
-Is that okay?
-Yep.

291
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:19,766
Try to get out of your own head.

292
00:18:21,101 --> 00:18:24,146
People are not all thinking
about you right now, okay?

293
00:18:24,229 --> 00:18:26,232
The whole town
isn't aimed at you.

294
00:18:26,315 --> 00:18:28,901
Hmm. I think you might
actually be wrong about that.

295
00:18:28,984 --> 00:18:32,571
You have a tendency to get
a little "woe is me"...

296
00:18:32,654 --> 00:18:35,908
-Wow. Wow. Okay.
-...and a little paranoid.

297
00:18:35,991 --> 00:18:38,535
And one thing I know has
never helped is this.

298
00:18:40,370 --> 00:18:41,788
What is "this"? What?

299
00:18:43,790 --> 00:18:46,001
A lonely drinking pity party.

300
00:18:49,963 --> 00:18:51,089
I'm not lonely.

301
00:18:53,383 --> 00:18:54,468
You're here.

302
00:18:58,847 --> 00:19:01,808
You know what I mean,
okay? And I can't stay.

303
00:19:02,893 --> 00:19:04,228
Does Donna know you're here?

304
00:19:05,437 --> 00:19:06,188
No.

305
00:19:06,271 --> 00:19:07,898
-Really?
-Really.

306
00:19:07,981 --> 00:19:11,401
We're not... You know, we're
not happening right now.

307
00:19:13,195 --> 00:19:14,196
Wow.

308
00:19:16,490 --> 00:19:17,616
It's not a big deal.

309
00:19:17,699 --> 00:19:18,825
Mm-hmm.

310
00:19:21,954 --> 00:19:23,163
You're ridiculous.

311
00:19:23,747 --> 00:19:25,999
Look at you. You're beaming.

312
00:19:28,252 --> 00:19:30,004
Come on. Have one
real drink with me.

313
00:19:30,087 --> 00:19:32,339
-Justine, no. Justine.
-Come on. Please.

314
00:19:33,298 --> 00:19:34,466
Please?

315
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:37,803
No.

316
00:19:42,391 --> 00:19:44,351
<i>♪ Gotta get up Gotta get out ♪</i>

317
00:19:44,434 --> 00:19:47,855
<i>♪ Gotta get home Before
the mornin' comes ♪</i>

318
00:19:47,938 --> 00:19:49,023
<i>♪ What if I'm late... ♪</i>

319
00:19:49,106 --> 00:19:50,731
Stop, please.

320
00:19:51,692 --> 00:19:53,318
You haven't changed a bit.

321
00:19:56,488 --> 00:19:58,031
What do you got going on today?

322
00:19:58,532 --> 00:19:59,450
Work.

323
00:19:59,533 --> 00:20:01,994
Working. All day. Till late.

324
00:20:02,077 --> 00:20:04,497
Okay. I believe you. Jesus.

325
00:20:04,580 --> 00:20:05,831
What?

326
00:20:05,914 --> 00:20:07,082
Uh, don't-don't worry.

327
00:20:07,165 --> 00:20:08,876
I'm not gonna be,
like, spam texting you

328
00:20:08,959 --> 00:20:10,628
all day and night.
I learned my lesson.

329
00:20:10,711 --> 00:20:13,630
Justine, I'm just saying
I'm working. That's it.

330
00:20:16,592 --> 00:20:17,635
How's work?

331
00:20:17,718 --> 00:20:19,261
It's fine. It's whatever.

332
00:20:20,429 --> 00:20:23,765
Wow. I hope that's not the
general vibe over there.

333
00:20:24,474 --> 00:20:25,392
What does that mean?

334
00:20:25,475 --> 00:20:29,021
Well, there's 17 missing
children out there,

335
00:20:29,104 --> 00:20:31,607
and I like to think the people
in charge of finding them

336
00:20:31,690 --> 00:20:34,068
aren't like, "Oh,
whatever," about their jobs.

337
00:20:34,151 --> 00:20:36,028
First of all, I'm
not a detective.

338
00:20:36,111 --> 00:20:37,780
I don't know if you know that.

339
00:20:37,863 --> 00:20:40,282
Second of all, I'm
hungover as shit.

340
00:20:40,365 --> 00:20:43,160
I didn't realize I was getting
grilled on the investigation.

341
00:20:43,243 --> 00:20:44,286
No, no, no. I'm not...

342
00:20:44,369 --> 00:20:45,454
I'm not trying to grill.

343
00:20:45,537 --> 00:20:48,374
I'm just wondering if I need
to solve this thing myself.

344
00:20:48,457 --> 00:20:49,708
We're on it.

345
00:20:49,791 --> 00:20:51,084
-You're on it?
-Yep.

346
00:20:52,252 --> 00:20:55,089
Okay, well, what a load off.

347
00:20:55,172 --> 00:20:56,256
You're on it.

348
00:20:57,257 --> 00:20:59,927
Right now, you really
need to take it easy.

349
00:21:00,469 --> 00:21:01,762
No one's slacking.

350
00:21:02,554 --> 00:21:03,889
Don't let yourself get all...

351
00:21:03,972 --> 00:21:05,516
Get all Justine about it?

352
00:21:05,599 --> 00:21:09,061
Just leave the investigating
to the investigators.

353
00:21:13,649 --> 00:21:14,983
It was great to see you.

354
00:21:16,068 --> 00:21:17,068
You too.

355
00:21:25,327 --> 00:21:26,870
Suck my dick.

356
00:22:22,843 --> 00:22:23,844
Hello?

357
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:13,412
<i>I explicitly told you</i>

358
00:24:13,495 --> 00:24:15,164
<i>not to interact with Alex.</i>

359
00:24:15,247 --> 00:24:17,041
Well, technically, I
didn't interact with him.

360
00:24:17,124 --> 00:24:18,375
<i>You followed him home.</i>

361
00:24:18,458 --> 00:24:20,461
<i>You rang his doorbell repeatedly</i>

362
00:24:20,544 --> 00:24:22,254
<i>then spied through a window.</i>

363
00:24:22,337 --> 00:24:24,340
Well, can... can we
just focus on the fact

364
00:24:24,423 --> 00:24:25,841
that that house is bizarre?

365
00:24:25,924 --> 00:24:28,094
<i>Justine, if I wasn't
clear with you before,</i>

366
00:24:28,177 --> 00:24:29,804
<i>let me do so now.</i>

367
00:24:29,887 --> 00:24:32,515
<i>I want you to leave him alone.</i>

368
00:24:32,598 --> 00:24:34,433
Okay, why were his
windows taped up?

369
00:24:34,516 --> 00:24:36,060
Doesn't that seem
strange to you?

370
00:24:36,143 --> 00:24:38,729
<i>Probably because nosy people
take it upon themselves</i>

371
00:24:38,812 --> 00:24:40,189
<i>to walk up and
peek through them.</i>

372
00:24:40,272 --> 00:24:41,940
-But, Marcus...
-<i>Are you kidding?</i>

373
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:44,276
<i>I'm gonna do you the courtesy</i>

374
00:24:44,359 --> 00:24:47,070
<i>of forgetting that this
phone call ever took place.</i>

375
00:25:16,308 --> 00:25:18,185
-What the fuck?
-You fucked him?

376
00:25:18,268 --> 00:25:19,394
Donna?

377
00:25:19,937 --> 00:25:21,397
-You fucked him?
-Donna, no. I...

378
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:22,523
I-I didn't fuck him.

379
00:25:22,606 --> 00:25:24,608
-Yes, you did. I know you did.
-No, no, no. No, he...

380
00:25:24,691 --> 00:25:26,360
He said you weren't together.

381
00:25:26,443 --> 00:25:27,445
-Liar!
-No, no, no!

382
00:25:27,528 --> 00:25:29,363
-You got him drunk!
-Donna, stop. Stop!

383
00:25:29,446 --> 00:25:32,408
He was trying to be nice to
you, and you got him drunk!

384
00:25:32,491 --> 00:25:33,742
-Hey! Hey! Don't!
-Stop!

385
00:25:33,825 --> 00:25:37,204
Look at what you did!

386
00:25:37,955 --> 00:25:40,791
<i>Luciano, I know we got
off to a rocky start</i>

387
00:25:40,874 --> 00:25:43,502
<i>with everything that
happened in the Jacuzzi,</i>

388
00:25:43,585 --> 00:25:45,754
<i>but still you have made me...</i>

389
00:27:47,793 --> 00:27:48,794
Oh, my God.

390
00:27:56,927 --> 00:27:59,471
Alex, hi. How are you?

391
00:28:02,057 --> 00:28:03,517
I-I just wanted to say hi

392
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:06,728
'cause I've been thinking
about you a lot, and...

393
00:28:07,354 --> 00:28:08,481
I wanted to make
sure you're okay.

394
00:28:08,564 --> 00:28:09,731
I'm okay.

395
00:28:11,817 --> 00:28:12,777
Yeah?

396
00:28:12,860 --> 00:28:17,782
'Cause I know it's been a
really hard time for me,

397
00:28:17,865 --> 00:28:20,785
and I can't even imagine
how it's been like...

398
00:28:20,868 --> 00:28:21,952
I have to go.

399
00:28:22,953 --> 00:28:24,705
Hey, hang on, please.

400
00:28:24,788 --> 00:28:26,415
I just... I just
want to make sure

401
00:28:26,498 --> 00:28:28,542
-that everything's all right.
-Don't follow me!

402
00:28:36,008 --> 00:28:38,844
Hello? It's Ms. Gandy.
I'd like to talk to you.

403
00:28:43,265 --> 00:28:44,266
Hello?

404
00:28:47,728 --> 00:28:49,021
I know you're home.

405
00:31:40,734 --> 00:31:41,735
I'm going to work.

406
00:32:41,003 --> 00:32:42,338
Been calling you
all morning, boss.

407
00:32:42,421 --> 00:32:44,338
Yeah, I hit a snag
on the way over.

408
00:32:47,509 --> 00:32:48,469
How things looking?

409
00:32:48,552 --> 00:32:50,596
Little bit of a chaotic morning.

410
00:32:51,180 --> 00:32:52,431
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

411
00:32:53,098 --> 00:32:54,558
Marc went to go
pick up the sodding,

412
00:32:54,641 --> 00:32:55,684
but they didn't have it in

413
00:32:55,767 --> 00:32:57,394
'cause the order
never got placed.

414
00:32:57,477 --> 00:32:59,855
Shit. Goddamn it. That...

415
00:33:00,772 --> 00:33:02,149
All right, I'm sorry about that.

416
00:33:02,232 --> 00:33:04,902
Yeah, we got the owner coming
Friday for a walk-through,

417
00:33:04,985 --> 00:33:07,029
and we're still gonna
have the open frame in.

418
00:33:07,112 --> 00:33:08,447
It's on me. It's my bad.

419
00:33:09,114 --> 00:33:10,866
And then I showed up,
and I see that Alvin

420
00:33:10,949 --> 00:33:13,493
painted the door with the
paint that you ordered, and...

421
00:33:14,203 --> 00:33:15,204
Yeah?

422
00:33:15,871 --> 00:33:17,664
They wanted forest
green and that's red.

423
00:33:18,665 --> 00:33:19,792
-What?
-Look.

424
00:33:19,875 --> 00:33:21,836
Goddamn it. Wait a minute.
Did they send the wrong...

425
00:33:21,919 --> 00:33:23,796
I checked the order,
and we ordered it.

426
00:33:23,879 --> 00:33:25,756
They sent what we asked for,
but what we asked for was...

427
00:33:25,839 --> 00:33:27,508
All right. I fucked up.

428
00:33:27,591 --> 00:33:29,676
I'll take it back,
get the right one.

429
00:33:46,693 --> 00:33:47,694
Mr. Graff.

430
00:33:48,570 --> 00:33:49,571
Yeah.

431
00:33:51,365 --> 00:33:53,367
We follow up on every
one of these calls.

432
00:33:53,450 --> 00:33:55,119
So I can assure you
that as we speak,

433
00:33:55,202 --> 00:33:57,037
we have officers
aggressively pursuing

434
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:59,122
every lead that comes
through this station.

435
00:33:59,623 --> 00:34:01,417
So, what about the feds?
They got nothing new?

436
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:04,170
There continues to be a very
healthy information exchange.

437
00:34:04,253 --> 00:34:05,921
So I can tell you
with full confidence

438
00:34:06,004 --> 00:34:09,049
that they are also pursuing
every lead aggressively.

439
00:34:10,342 --> 00:34:11,719
What's happening
with the K-9 units?

440
00:34:11,802 --> 00:34:14,346
I haven't heard about any
K-9 reports in a long time.

441
00:34:14,429 --> 00:34:16,514
That's because they
don't report to you.

442
00:34:18,684 --> 00:34:20,895
Mr. Graff, I can
understand your passion.

443
00:34:20,978 --> 00:34:23,063
And I don't mind having
these conversations with you

444
00:34:23,146 --> 00:34:24,857
because, God forbid,
if it was my child,

445
00:34:24,940 --> 00:34:26,400
I'd be demanding answers too.

446
00:34:26,483 --> 00:34:28,986
But I need you to trust that
what we're doing here...

447
00:34:29,069 --> 00:34:30,529
She's still not talking, huh?

448
00:34:33,447 --> 00:34:34,449
She knows.

449
00:34:34,949 --> 00:34:36,618
I disagree with that.

450
00:34:37,369 --> 00:34:39,913
You're aggressively
following up on every lead,

451
00:34:39,996 --> 00:34:43,292
and yet she's just out there
walking around free as a bird.

452
00:34:43,375 --> 00:34:45,669
Have you done any looking
into her whatsoever?

453
00:34:45,752 --> 00:34:47,171
Extensively. Yes, we have.

454
00:34:47,254 --> 00:34:48,547
So you know about her past, huh?

455
00:34:48,630 --> 00:34:50,299
'Cause I've done some digging.

456
00:34:50,882 --> 00:34:52,467
And I've found out a lot.

457
00:34:53,092 --> 00:34:56,263
She had a DUI two years
ago. Did you not see that?

458
00:34:56,346 --> 00:34:58,766
She was let go from her last
school that she taught at

459
00:34:58,849 --> 00:35:00,017
for inappropriate behavior.

460
00:35:00,100 --> 00:35:01,519
Did you not see that one either?

461
00:35:01,602 --> 00:35:03,813
With a member of the faculty.

462
00:35:03,896 --> 00:35:06,148
She's a troubled
person, is she not?

463
00:35:08,275 --> 00:35:10,027
What is it you think
that she knows?

464
00:35:11,695 --> 00:35:13,572
What do you think it is
that she's not telling us?

465
00:35:13,655 --> 00:35:15,324
Because those kids walked
out of those homes.

466
00:35:15,407 --> 00:35:16,700
No one pulled them out.

467
00:35:17,826 --> 00:35:19,203
No one forced them.

468
00:35:19,286 --> 00:35:20,871
I don't see anything whatsoever

469
00:35:20,954 --> 00:35:22,623
that points to that woman.

470
00:35:25,459 --> 00:35:27,044
What do you see that I don't?

471
00:35:27,836 --> 00:35:30,464
I see something that I
don't understand at all.

472
00:35:30,547 --> 00:35:31,549
Yeah!

473
00:35:31,632 --> 00:35:35,553
We're talking about 17
kids in one classroom.

474
00:35:35,636 --> 00:35:37,012
And none of them
talked about it?

475
00:35:37,095 --> 00:35:37,972
Exactly.

476
00:35:38,055 --> 00:35:39,473
And we got how many
parents in here,

477
00:35:39,556 --> 00:35:41,224
and none of us saw it coming?

478
00:35:42,768 --> 00:35:45,479
I want to know what
happened in that classroom.

479
00:35:45,562 --> 00:35:48,189
Why just her classroom?
Why only hers?

480
00:35:50,442 --> 00:35:51,735
Where are our children?

481
00:35:51,818 --> 00:35:52,903
You're just gonna leave?

482
00:35:52,986 --> 00:35:53,821
That's enough.

483
00:35:53,904 --> 00:35:55,114
Everybody needs to
give us some space.

484
00:35:55,197 --> 00:35:56,698
Please. Please.

485
00:35:57,241 --> 00:35:59,160
Let's all get a
good night's sleep.

486
00:35:59,243 --> 00:36:00,911
Wake up with clearer
heads. Please.

487
00:36:02,579 --> 00:36:04,373
She has answers!

488
00:36:09,962 --> 00:36:11,422
Excuse me, miss, I'm
saving up for a bus ticket

489
00:36:11,505 --> 00:36:13,007
to see my brother. Do you
have any change on you at all?

490
00:36:13,090 --> 00:36:14,216
Sorry.

491
00:37:19,323 --> 00:37:20,324
Matthew?

492
00:37:35,297 --> 00:37:36,298
Matthew.

493
00:37:49,102 --> 00:37:50,229
Matthew!

494
00:37:53,357 --> 00:37:54,358
Stop!

495
00:38:16,380 --> 00:38:17,381
Wait.

496
00:39:28,076 --> 00:39:29,077
Matthew?

497
00:40:07,449 --> 00:40:08,450
Matthew?

498
00:40:16,917 --> 00:40:18,252
Matthew, where are you?

499
00:40:22,381 --> 00:40:23,799
Where did you go?

500
00:40:28,679 --> 00:40:29,680
Talk to me.

501
00:40:31,431 --> 00:40:32,599
Talk to me!

502
00:40:41,817 --> 00:40:42,860
I'm sorry.

503
00:40:44,361 --> 00:40:46,488
I'm sorry that I
wasn't able to sa...

504
00:40:47,739 --> 00:40:48,949
That I wasn't able...

505
00:40:53,537 --> 00:40:55,789
I wanted to say
it so many times.

506
00:40:58,417 --> 00:41:00,086
I really do want to
say it all the time

507
00:41:00,169 --> 00:41:02,588
because I feel it all the time.

508
00:41:08,468 --> 00:41:09,595
I love you so much.

509
00:41:19,813 --> 00:41:20,981
What the fuck?

510
00:41:51,595 --> 00:41:53,055
Where's our house?

511
00:41:54,097 --> 00:41:55,390
There.

512
00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:05,359
Where's the tower? Tower,
tower, tower, tower, tower.

513
00:42:05,442 --> 00:42:06,860
Ah.

514
00:42:21,416 --> 00:42:22,417
Show me.

515
00:42:24,837 --> 00:42:25,838
Come on.

516
00:42:42,479 --> 00:42:43,522
Hi.

517
00:42:43,605 --> 00:42:45,148
-Hello.
-How are you?

518
00:42:46,692 --> 00:42:47,777
I'm Archer Graff.
I'm Matthew's...

519
00:42:47,860 --> 00:42:49,236
Yeah, I know who you are. Hi.

520
00:42:49,319 --> 00:42:52,406
Oh, good. I know we haven't
spoken before directly.

521
00:42:53,073 --> 00:42:54,867
We've seen each other
at a lot of the same...

522
00:42:54,950 --> 00:42:57,578
-How are you, Archer?
-I'm good. I'm real good.

523
00:42:58,370 --> 00:42:59,580
I... You know.

524
00:42:59,663 --> 00:43:01,707
All things considered, just...

525
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:04,459
soldiering on.

526
00:43:05,377 --> 00:43:06,712
We have to, don't we?

527
00:43:07,212 --> 00:43:08,130
We do.

528
00:43:08,213 --> 00:43:11,217
Listen, I'm sorry to surprise
you at home like this

529
00:43:11,300 --> 00:43:12,718
in the... in the
middle of the day.

530
00:43:12,801 --> 00:43:14,678
But, um, I don't
know if you know,

531
00:43:14,761 --> 00:43:16,889
but we got some footage of
Matthew leaving the house

532
00:43:16,972 --> 00:43:18,891
on our Ring cam thing here,

533
00:43:19,725 --> 00:43:21,894
and I think you
folks had the same...

534
00:43:22,436 --> 00:43:23,979
same situation with Bailey?

535
00:43:24,688 --> 00:43:25,773
Yeah, that's right.

536
00:43:25,856 --> 00:43:27,983
All right. Well, I'm sure you
showed yours to the police

537
00:43:28,066 --> 00:43:30,194
just like I did, but I-I...

538
00:43:31,236 --> 00:43:34,198
I wondered if you would mind
letting me take a look at it.

539
00:43:35,032 --> 00:43:36,075
I don't need a copy or anything.

540
00:43:36,158 --> 00:43:37,618
I'm not comfortable with that.

541
00:43:42,956 --> 00:43:44,458
Okay. I understand.

542
00:44:06,897 --> 00:44:07,898
Gary?

543
00:44:08,899 --> 00:44:10,275
Archer Graff. How you doing?

544
00:44:10,943 --> 00:44:11,944
Fine.

545
00:44:12,653 --> 00:44:13,946
Matthew's dad.

546
00:44:14,947 --> 00:44:17,032
Yeah. Of course.

547
00:44:18,116 --> 00:44:19,034
How's it going?

548
00:44:19,117 --> 00:44:21,954
Um, I have a strange
question I need to ask you.

549
00:44:26,667 --> 00:44:28,127
It's kinda hard to watch this.

550
00:44:28,210 --> 00:44:29,962
Okay, wait. Go back to where
she steps on the sidewalk.

551
00:44:30,045 --> 00:44:31,046
Okay.

552
00:44:31,129 --> 00:44:32,214
Uh...

553
00:44:33,006 --> 00:44:34,925
Okay. Right there.

554
00:44:36,426 --> 00:44:37,469
What do you see?

555
00:44:39,096 --> 00:44:41,515
One, two, three, four...

556
00:44:41,598 --> 00:44:45,143
...five, six, seven.

557
00:44:59,366 --> 00:45:00,450
Sorry.

558
00:45:20,888 --> 00:45:22,556
Come on. What am I looking at?

559
00:45:57,382 --> 00:45:58,383
Hey.

560
00:45:59,176 --> 00:46:00,719
-I want to talk to you.
-Well, I...

561
00:46:00,802 --> 00:46:02,680
I don't think we have
anything to say to each other.

562
00:46:02,763 --> 00:46:03,806
I think you have a lot to say.

563
00:46:03,889 --> 00:46:05,891
You and every other
person in this city.

564
00:46:05,974 --> 00:46:08,227
Believe me, the message
is loud and clear.

565
00:46:08,310 --> 00:46:09,770
I'm the problem. Got it.

566
00:46:09,853 --> 00:46:10,980
You know what? I
think that's the first

567
00:46:11,063 --> 00:46:12,606
honest thing I've heard you say.

568
00:46:12,689 --> 00:46:14,900
-You are the problem.
-You wanna get in my face?

569
00:46:14,983 --> 00:46:16,277
-You wanna threaten me?
-I'm not...

570
00:46:16,360 --> 00:46:17,486
Nobody's threatening you.

571
00:46:17,569 --> 00:46:19,321
You're barking up
the wrong tree. Okay?

572
00:46:19,404 --> 00:46:21,740
This whole victim persona
that you're taking on,

573
00:46:21,823 --> 00:46:23,451
it might have the police fooled,

574
00:46:23,534 --> 00:46:24,951
it might have the
school fooled...

575
00:46:28,872 --> 00:46:30,666
-Stop thinking of yourself!
-Marcus?

576
00:46:30,749 --> 00:46:33,042
You and I are gonna have
a conversation right...

577
00:46:39,424 --> 00:46:40,424
Hey!

578
00:46:56,984 --> 00:46:58,276
Just stay down.

579
00:47:01,446 --> 00:47:02,447
Hey!

580
00:47:26,930 --> 00:47:27,848
<i>Hotel's good, though?</i>

581
00:47:27,931 --> 00:47:29,725
-<i>It's fine.</i>
-Yeah.

582
00:47:29,808 --> 00:47:32,394
<i>Not the Ritz, but I'm not
expecting them to go nuts.</i>

583
00:47:32,477 --> 00:47:36,148
Yeah. Well, it's only
for six nights. Right?

584
00:47:36,231 --> 00:47:37,483
<i>Three, actually.</i>

585
00:47:37,566 --> 00:47:39,026
<i>Apparently, I don't
have to be here</i>

586
00:47:39,109 --> 00:47:40,277
<i>for the big wrap-up shindig,</i>

587
00:47:40,360 --> 00:47:42,070
<i>so I get to leave on Thursday.</i>

588
00:47:43,488 --> 00:47:45,741
-<i>Isn't that great?</i>
-Yeah. It's good.

589
00:47:45,824 --> 00:47:47,535
<i>'Cause I'm supposed
to ovulate Friday,</i>

590
00:47:47,618 --> 00:47:49,745
<i>so we can hit the
target this month.</i>

591
00:47:51,246 --> 00:47:53,749
Nice. Okay. Yeah. Good.

592
00:47:53,832 --> 00:47:55,459
<i>I thought you'd like that.</i>

593
00:47:55,542 --> 00:47:58,421
<i>Oh, will you tell my dad
when you see him today</i>

594
00:47:58,504 --> 00:47:59,713
<i>that since I'll be
back for the weekend,</i>

595
00:47:59,796 --> 00:48:01,924
<i>we can make their
anniversary lunch thing?</i>

596
00:48:02,007 --> 00:48:03,551
Yeah, I'll let him know.

597
00:48:03,634 --> 00:48:04,802
<i>He'll be happy.</i>

598
00:48:04,885 --> 00:48:06,595
<i>You about to start your shift?</i>

599
00:48:06,678 --> 00:48:07,721
Yep.

600
00:48:07,804 --> 00:48:09,473
<i>You gonna hit a
meeting afterward?</i>

601
00:48:10,432 --> 00:48:12,768
Um, I wasn't planning on it.

602
00:48:14,186 --> 00:48:15,437
<i>Don't you think you should?</i>

603
00:48:17,231 --> 00:48:18,899
Uh, if I have
time, I'll hit one.

604
00:48:18,982 --> 00:48:20,734
<i>Paul, especially when</i>

605
00:48:20,817 --> 00:48:22,319
<i>you're going to be
spending stretches alone,</i>

606
00:48:22,402 --> 00:48:24,822
<i>I think it's important that
you go to regular meetings.</i>

607
00:48:24,905 --> 00:48:27,366
I'm not gonna drink,
Donna. I feel fine.

608
00:48:27,449 --> 00:48:30,661
If I don't feel fine, then
I'll hit a meeting. Okay?

609
00:48:31,286 --> 00:48:32,412
<i>Okay, sweetie.</i>

610
00:48:32,955 --> 00:48:34,999
Okay. I gotta get going now.

611
00:48:35,082 --> 00:48:36,917
<i>Okay. Don't forget to tell
my dad about this weekend.</i>

612
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:37,918
Yep.

613
00:48:38,001 --> 00:48:39,670
-<i>Love you.</i>
-Love you.

614
00:48:41,839 --> 00:48:43,173
Jesus Christ.

615
00:48:47,219 --> 00:48:48,220
Hey, Ed.

616
00:48:49,179 --> 00:48:50,222
Hey, buddy.

617
00:48:50,305 --> 00:48:51,599
Uh, Donna's back Friday,

618
00:48:51,682 --> 00:48:54,310
so we're good to have lunch
with you guys on Sunday.

619
00:48:54,393 --> 00:48:55,519
Why's she coming back early?

620
00:48:55,602 --> 00:48:57,563
I guess they're cutting
her loose, so...

621
00:48:58,146 --> 00:49:00,858
she wanted me to let
you know that we're in.

622
00:49:02,067 --> 00:49:03,151
Okay. Sounds good.

623
00:49:04,027 --> 00:49:06,363
Anniversary lunch?

624
00:49:07,823 --> 00:49:08,741
Yep.

625
00:49:08,824 --> 00:49:11,035
That's nice. Well,
congratulations and...

626
00:49:11,118 --> 00:49:13,370
-Well, thanks.
-A lot of years.

627
00:49:14,329 --> 00:49:15,706
You calling me old?

628
00:49:15,789 --> 00:49:17,082
No. No, sir. No, no, no.

629
00:49:17,165 --> 00:49:18,209
Why would you call me old?

630
00:49:18,292 --> 00:49:19,627
No, sir. I wasn't saying that.

631
00:49:19,710 --> 00:49:20,878
I'm giving you shit.

632
00:49:22,796 --> 00:49:24,465
Well, just starting
my shift here.

633
00:49:24,548 --> 00:49:25,632
Roger that.

634
00:49:52,034 --> 00:49:53,619
<i>Next Monday will mark 30 days</i>

635
00:49:53,702 --> 00:49:55,788
<i>since 17 grade-school
children have disappeared</i>

636
00:49:55,871 --> 00:49:56,872
<i>from McCarren County.</i>

637
00:49:56,955 --> 00:49:59,166
<i>Community members have
issued a $50,000 reward</i>

638
00:49:59,249 --> 00:50:01,252
<i>for any information
leading to their recovery.</i>

639
00:50:01,335 --> 00:50:03,003
<i>Any suspicious
individual or activity</i>

640
00:50:03,086 --> 00:50:04,246
<i>should be reported to your...</i>

641
00:50:16,892 --> 00:50:19,186
Stop right there. Police.

642
00:50:22,189 --> 00:50:23,273
Shit.

643
00:51:04,648 --> 00:51:06,275
Stop or you're
gonna get the Taser!

644
00:51:10,153 --> 00:51:11,989
Dude, please. Stop.
Stop. Stop. Stop.

645
00:51:12,072 --> 00:51:14,033
-Shut up.
-Please. I work there, man.

646
00:51:14,116 --> 00:51:16,952
I just lost my keys. Please.

647
00:51:18,245 --> 00:51:19,912
I lost my keys. Please.

648
00:51:21,290 --> 00:51:23,501
-You okay?
-Yes, Officer, I'm okay.

649
00:51:23,584 --> 00:51:25,336
All right. We went down
pretty hard there. You good?

650
00:51:25,419 --> 00:51:27,588
Officer, I'm okay. Just
please call my warehouse.

651
00:51:27,671 --> 00:51:28,839
You can look the
number up online.

652
00:51:28,922 --> 00:51:30,132
My phone isn't
working right now.

653
00:51:30,215 --> 00:51:31,634
Cuffs too tight? Hands okay?

654
00:51:31,717 --> 00:51:33,344
Yes, they're okay, Officer.

655
00:51:33,427 --> 00:51:34,887
-Let's walk back to the car.
-No, no, no.

656
00:51:34,970 --> 00:51:36,138
Come on. Let's go.
One, two, three.

657
00:51:36,221 --> 00:51:37,306
Please, Officer. Officer.

658
00:51:40,350 --> 00:51:42,269
-Hey, what's your name, sir?
-James.

659
00:51:42,352 --> 00:51:44,688
James, okay. Stand right
here for me, James.

660
00:51:44,771 --> 00:51:46,816
-You got any weapons on you?
-No.

661
00:51:46,899 --> 00:51:48,943
No? How about drugs?
Are you holding?

662
00:51:49,026 --> 00:51:50,027
No, sir.

663
00:51:50,110 --> 00:51:51,779
Anything in your
pockets gonna stick me

664
00:51:51,862 --> 00:51:53,155
when I put my hands
in there, James?

665
00:51:53,238 --> 00:51:54,573
No, sir. I do not.

666
00:51:55,657 --> 00:51:57,576
Are you sure? I don't wanna
get poked by anything.

667
00:51:57,659 --> 00:51:58,952
I have nothing, sir.

668
00:51:59,578 --> 00:52:01,788
Okay, James. Hold
still for me there.

669
00:52:05,709 --> 00:52:07,419
Shouldn't run from
the police, sir.

670
00:52:10,005 --> 00:52:11,507
Ah! Fuck!

671
00:52:36,448 --> 00:52:38,242
Please. Please be okay.

672
00:52:48,168 --> 00:52:49,461
Shit.

673
00:52:52,256 --> 00:52:55,008
Okay. Up. Up. Get up.

674
00:52:55,509 --> 00:52:57,719
Hey. Can you hear me?

675
00:52:59,137 --> 00:53:00,264
James? You with me?

676
00:53:01,056 --> 00:53:02,850
Ow. What the fuck?

677
00:53:04,268 --> 00:53:05,561
Fucking hit me, bro.

678
00:53:05,644 --> 00:53:07,313
Okay. Here's what's
gonna happen now.

679
00:53:07,396 --> 00:53:09,482
I'm gonna take these
cuffs off you, okay?

680
00:53:09,565 --> 00:53:10,941
I'm gonna get in
my car in a second.

681
00:53:11,024 --> 00:53:12,610
I'm gonna drive away, but...

682
00:53:12,693 --> 00:53:13,986
Are you listening to me?

683
00:53:14,528 --> 00:53:16,321
I don't want to see
you here again, okay?

684
00:53:16,947 --> 00:53:18,783
The way I see it,
I did you wrong,

685
00:53:18,866 --> 00:53:20,034
you did me wrong.

686
00:53:20,117 --> 00:53:21,994
Let's just call it a day.

687
00:53:23,036 --> 00:53:24,288
But if I see you out here again,

688
00:53:24,371 --> 00:53:26,915
it's gonna be a
different story. Yes?

689
00:53:28,041 --> 00:53:29,042
Yes?

690
00:53:29,543 --> 00:53:30,544
I mean it.

691
00:53:31,170 --> 00:53:34,882
Okay, consider yourself
warned. Now, let's get up.

692
00:53:34,965 --> 00:53:37,801
I'm gonna take these
cuffs off you. One, two...

693
00:53:41,513 --> 00:53:42,765
Because right now, this is a...

694
00:53:42,848 --> 00:53:44,058
this is a whole other matter.

695
00:53:44,141 --> 00:53:45,684
Somebody needs to
just tell this guy

696
00:53:45,767 --> 00:53:47,436
his kid is not the
only kid missing.

697
00:53:47,519 --> 00:53:49,605
There's 17 kids. All...

698
00:53:58,780 --> 00:53:59,865
Okay, listen.

699
00:54:02,409 --> 00:54:03,994
As long as this isn't reported,

700
00:54:04,077 --> 00:54:06,247
that footage is gonna
sit on a drive somewhere,

701
00:54:06,330 --> 00:54:08,832
and it's gonna get recorded
over in about a month.

702
00:54:09,416 --> 00:54:10,543
And if that fucking citizen

703
00:54:10,626 --> 00:54:12,128
doesn't come back
here in a month

704
00:54:12,211 --> 00:54:15,506
and file a complaint,
this could all go away.

705
00:54:16,507 --> 00:54:17,591
But if they do...

706
00:54:18,967 --> 00:54:21,094
Paul, you're gonna be in
some serious hot water.

707
00:54:23,430 --> 00:54:25,390
Did you get that
hand checked out?

708
00:54:30,938 --> 00:54:31,939
Fuck!

709
00:54:54,753 --> 00:54:55,754
Hey!

710
00:54:57,589 --> 00:54:58,632
Can we hug?

711
00:54:58,715 --> 00:55:01,217
Yeah, of course
we can hug. Jesus.

712
00:55:44,720 --> 00:55:46,263
Hello?

713
00:55:46,805 --> 00:55:48,056
Paul?

714
00:55:49,266 --> 00:55:50,267
Hey.

715
00:55:51,727 --> 00:55:53,729
-Where have you been?
-You're home.

716
00:55:53,812 --> 00:55:55,481
I am.

717
00:55:55,564 --> 00:55:56,607
Someone got sick,

718
00:55:56,690 --> 00:56:00,736
and they sent everyone on
my team, on Morris's...

719
00:56:01,486 --> 00:56:02,487
Where have you been?

720
00:56:03,280 --> 00:56:04,865
I was, uh... I was out.

721
00:56:07,201 --> 00:56:08,202
Where?

722
00:56:13,081 --> 00:56:14,082
Paul.

723
00:56:20,130 --> 00:56:21,507
You piece of shit.

724
00:56:22,841 --> 00:56:24,593
You wanna switch up lunch
today or same place?

725
00:56:24,676 --> 00:56:27,221
-Yeah, pizza?
-Yeah. Lunch on you today?

726
00:56:34,603 --> 00:56:35,854
I have seen this issue...

727
00:56:50,160 --> 00:56:51,328
Son of a bitch.

728
00:56:52,037 --> 00:56:52,955
Hey!

729
00:56:53,038 --> 00:56:54,999
What did I tell you? Huh?

730
00:56:55,082 --> 00:56:56,417
What did I tell you?

731
00:56:56,500 --> 00:56:58,710
What did I fuck...
Oh, you fucker.

732
00:57:05,092 --> 00:57:06,093
Fucker!

733
00:57:18,981 --> 00:57:21,191
<i>This is fucking bullshit.
Look at this shit.</i>

734
00:57:21,817 --> 00:57:23,735
Please, please, please, please.

735
00:57:24,528 --> 00:57:26,654
Right here, right
here, right here. Yep.

736
00:57:29,241 --> 00:57:30,826
Goddamn it. What the fuck!

737
00:57:35,080 --> 00:57:36,081
Fuck.

738
00:57:36,790 --> 00:57:39,543
Piece of shit. Yes. Goddamn it.

739
00:57:41,837 --> 00:57:43,005
Please, please, please.

740
00:57:45,424 --> 00:57:48,635
Fuck! Fuck! Come on.
Goddamn it. Fucking go.

741
00:57:49,511 --> 00:57:51,430
Yes. Goddamn it.

742
00:57:51,513 --> 00:57:53,432
Argh! Fucking shit!

743
00:57:56,435 --> 00:57:57,436
Fuck!

744
00:57:59,104 --> 00:58:00,480
Yo, new phone.

745
00:58:01,773 --> 00:58:03,067
It's me, dude.

746
00:58:03,150 --> 00:58:05,152
Um, dude, I got a job yesterday.

747
00:58:05,235 --> 00:58:06,487
Yeah, thank you, man.

748
00:58:06,570 --> 00:58:07,571
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

749
00:58:07,654 --> 00:58:10,199
Yeah, um, so just, like, a
little teeny-tiny problem

750
00:58:10,282 --> 00:58:12,952
'cause I just... I can't start
till I have, like, new shoes.

751
00:58:13,035 --> 00:58:14,120
And, you know, a whole outfit.

752
00:58:14,203 --> 00:58:15,996
'Cause, you know, like
I said, it's fancy.

753
00:58:16,079 --> 00:58:17,164
And, um...

754
00:58:17,956 --> 00:58:19,542
Wait, wait, wait. No,
no, no. Wait, wait.

755
00:58:19,625 --> 00:58:20,960
This is a good thing.
I got... I got a job,

756
00:58:21,043 --> 00:58:23,337
and I'm-I'm-I'm freaking...
I'm doing the thing.

757
00:58:23,420 --> 00:58:25,172
So, you know, we can
start chilling again.

758
00:58:27,508 --> 00:58:28,926
Of course I'm
gonna pay Mom back,

759
00:58:29,009 --> 00:58:30,010
but I can't do that

760
00:58:30,093 --> 00:58:33,722
until I get the, you know,
money to get the clothes,

761
00:58:33,805 --> 00:58:36,058
so that I can do the job,
so that I can pay Mom back.

762
00:58:37,392 --> 00:58:38,393
Hello?

763
00:58:39,728 --> 00:58:41,897
Argh! You fucking bitch.

764
00:58:42,481 --> 00:58:44,399
Fuck. Fuck. Fuck.

765
00:58:47,778 --> 00:58:49,530
Hey, man, I feel like I
wasn't communicating very well

766
00:58:49,613 --> 00:58:50,614
how important it is that I get

767
00:58:50,697 --> 00:58:51,740
just, like, a
little bit of money,

768
00:58:51,823 --> 00:58:52,950
so that I can get the
clothes for the job,

769
00:58:53,033 --> 00:58:55,369
so that I can get
the job, obviously.

770
00:58:55,452 --> 00:58:57,538
So please call me back so I
can communicate that better.

771
00:58:57,621 --> 00:58:58,789
Thanks, buddy. Love you.

772
00:58:59,540 --> 00:59:00,874
Hell, yeah!

773
00:59:19,017 --> 00:59:20,018
No.

774
00:59:21,270 --> 00:59:22,271
No?

775
00:59:22,813 --> 00:59:23,856
I don't want.

776
00:59:23,939 --> 00:59:25,691
What do you mean? Why you
no want? This is good.

777
00:59:25,774 --> 00:59:26,776
These are good. These are good.

778
00:59:26,859 --> 00:59:28,444
Look, this is worth,
like, 50 bucks.

779
00:59:28,527 --> 00:59:29,528
No.

780
00:59:29,611 --> 00:59:30,612
Twenty.

781
00:59:31,113 --> 00:59:32,113
Ten.

782
00:59:33,115 --> 00:59:34,116
Five.

783
00:59:34,658 --> 00:59:35,951
Please, dude. Please.

784
00:59:49,631 --> 00:59:50,632
Fuck.

785
00:59:53,010 --> 00:59:54,595
Stop right there. Police.

786
01:00:00,767 --> 01:00:01,767
Fuck!

787
01:00:07,900 --> 01:00:09,902
<i>Way I see it, I did you
wrong, you did me wrong.</i>

788
01:00:09,985 --> 01:00:11,195
We're gonna call it a day.

789
01:00:12,029 --> 01:00:13,614
But if I see you
out here again...

790
01:00:15,782 --> 01:00:17,993
it's gonna be a
different story. Yeah?

791
01:00:19,870 --> 01:00:21,705
Okay. Consider yourself warned.

792
01:00:21,788 --> 01:00:22,873
Get the fuck up.

793
01:01:14,675 --> 01:01:15,676
Fuck!

794
01:01:16,426 --> 01:01:17,886
The fuck off me, man.

795
01:02:00,762 --> 01:02:01,846
What the fuck?

796
01:03:21,218 --> 01:03:22,219
Shit.

797
01:03:53,834 --> 01:03:54,835
Oh, shit.

798
01:03:56,503 --> 01:03:57,671
Oh, fuck, <i>Willow</i>.

799
01:04:02,176 --> 01:04:03,343
Jesus! Fuck!

800
01:04:05,888 --> 01:04:07,306
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Um...

801
01:04:12,644 --> 01:04:13,645
Hello?

802
01:04:18,525 --> 01:04:19,526
You good?

803
01:04:53,894 --> 01:04:55,145
What the fuck?

804
01:05:52,160 --> 01:05:54,038
Sorry! Fuck! Sorry!

805
01:05:54,121 --> 01:05:55,163
Sorry!

806
01:05:55,664 --> 01:05:57,208
Fuck!

807
01:05:57,291 --> 01:06:00,127
What the fuck? What the fuck?

808
01:06:05,549 --> 01:06:06,633
Fuck.

809
01:06:10,470 --> 01:06:12,555
Goddamn it. Piece of shit.

810
01:06:20,564 --> 01:06:22,357
What the fuck? Jesus! Fuck!

811
01:06:24,776 --> 01:06:26,278
Fuck! Goddamn it.

812
01:06:27,654 --> 01:06:29,907
Fuck! Argh! Please,
please, please.

813
01:06:30,616 --> 01:06:31,617
Fuck!

814
01:06:55,140 --> 01:06:58,977
20, 40, 60, 80, 100.

815
01:06:59,937 --> 01:07:00,938
Hey.

816
01:07:10,614 --> 01:07:11,907
I'm calling about
the $50,000 reward

817
01:07:11,990 --> 01:07:13,367
for information about
the missing kids

818
01:07:13,450 --> 01:07:14,910
'cause I know where they are.

819
01:07:17,079 --> 01:07:18,998
I'm pretty sure all of 'em.
Looked like a bunch of 'em.

820
01:07:19,081 --> 01:07:20,791
They're all standing in
the basement of this house,

821
01:07:20,874 --> 01:07:22,501
just, like, standing
there. And, um...

822
01:07:22,584 --> 01:07:23,794
I don't know. They're
in the basement

823
01:07:23,877 --> 01:07:24,712
standing all still and shit.

824
01:07:24,795 --> 01:07:26,255
And there's, like, fucking
two wackos over there.

825
01:07:26,338 --> 01:07:27,965
And it's just, like, fucked-up.

826
01:07:28,048 --> 01:07:30,217
Um, but... So how's this...
how's this gonna work, though?

827
01:07:30,300 --> 01:07:31,426
How do I get the money?

828
01:07:32,761 --> 01:07:34,930
No, I'm not... I'm...
I'm completely serious.

829
01:07:35,013 --> 01:07:36,849
I mean, I can show you.
Like, I'll show you.

830
01:07:36,932 --> 01:07:38,517
Um, but I just... I, uh...

831
01:07:38,600 --> 01:07:40,311
I really don't wanna come
in, 'cause, like, someone...

832
01:07:40,394 --> 01:07:41,979
Could someone come meet me
somewhere with the cash?

833
01:07:42,062 --> 01:07:43,147
'Cause like... I just...

834
01:07:43,230 --> 01:07:45,024
I really don't like
police stations, you know?

835
01:07:45,107 --> 01:07:47,484
They just kind of freak me
out. I'm, uh... I'm phobic.

836
01:07:53,907 --> 01:07:54,908
Hey!

837
01:07:56,285 --> 01:07:58,328
What did I tell you?
What did I fucking...

838
01:08:13,760 --> 01:08:16,262
"What'd I tell you,
huh? What'd I tell you?

839
01:08:16,345 --> 01:08:18,515
What'd I tell you? I'm
a big cop, and I..."

840
01:08:59,096 --> 01:09:00,599
You're okay. You're okay.

841
01:09:00,682 --> 01:09:02,601
That wasn't real. That wasn't
real. That wasn't real.

842
01:09:02,684 --> 01:09:04,019
It's okay. You're okay.

843
01:09:35,843 --> 01:09:36,844
Fuck.

844
01:09:40,013 --> 01:09:41,599
Fucker! You stabbed me!

845
01:09:41,682 --> 01:09:43,434
No, no, no. I'm sorry.
Sorry. It was an accident.

846
01:09:43,517 --> 01:09:44,852
It was an accident. I'm sorry.

847
01:09:44,935 --> 01:09:46,562
Wait, wait, wait.
Wait, wait. Wait, wait.

848
01:09:46,645 --> 01:09:47,646
I know where those kids are.

849
01:09:47,729 --> 01:09:48,898
That's why I was
coming to the station.

850
01:09:48,981 --> 01:09:50,858
-You're fucking lying!
-No, no, no, I'm not. I'm not.

851
01:09:50,941 --> 01:09:52,985
I promise. I promise. I know
where they are. I promise.

852
01:09:53,068 --> 01:09:54,110
Where?

853
01:09:55,153 --> 01:09:57,907
They're at-at-at a house,
not far, in the basement.

854
01:09:57,990 --> 01:10:00,033
What the fuck are
you t... What house?

855
01:10:00,659 --> 01:10:01,744
I... I can show you, man.

856
01:10:01,827 --> 01:10:03,579
It's-it's really,
really, really close.

857
01:10:17,259 --> 01:10:18,844
Oh, fuck me.

858
01:10:21,054 --> 01:10:22,055
Do you have AIDS?

859
01:10:23,515 --> 01:10:24,433
Huh?

860
01:10:24,516 --> 01:10:26,894
AIDS, asshole. Do you have AIDS?

861
01:10:27,436 --> 01:10:28,646
Uh...

862
01:10:28,729 --> 01:10:30,314
Uh, I don't think so.

863
01:10:30,814 --> 01:10:32,274
Hepatitis? Shit like that?

864
01:10:33,066 --> 01:10:35,110
I mean, shit, not
that I know of.

865
01:10:45,579 --> 01:10:46,539
That one, the dark one.

866
01:10:46,622 --> 01:10:48,022
Right there at the
end of the block.

867
01:11:01,970 --> 01:11:03,305
Um, excuse me, sir.

868
01:11:03,388 --> 01:11:05,349
Um, I don't want to
be rude, but, like,

869
01:11:05,933 --> 01:11:07,393
how do I know you aren't
gonna try and, like,

870
01:11:07,476 --> 01:11:09,311
take that reward for yourself?

871
01:11:12,689 --> 01:11:13,690
Sir?

872
01:11:15,859 --> 01:11:16,860
Sir?

873
01:11:17,986 --> 01:11:18,987
Officer?

874
01:11:20,614 --> 01:11:22,574
Oh, man.

875
01:11:41,385 --> 01:11:42,553
What the fuck?

876
01:11:52,771 --> 01:11:53,939
What the fuck?

877
01:11:55,607 --> 01:11:57,734
What the fuck?

878
01:11:59,152 --> 01:12:02,406
Let me the fuck out
of here. Goddamn it.

879
01:12:05,617 --> 01:12:07,661
Oh. Thank you.

880
01:12:13,166 --> 01:12:14,334
What the fuck?

881
01:12:22,509 --> 01:12:25,221
Jesus Christ. What the
fuck? Hey, yo, you good?

882
01:12:25,304 --> 01:12:26,388
Jesus Christ, bro!

883
01:12:26,471 --> 01:12:28,224
Hey! Get off me, bro!

884
01:12:28,307 --> 01:12:31,310
Get the fuck off me!
Get the fuck off me!

885
01:12:31,393 --> 01:12:32,645
Hey! Fuck!

886
01:12:32,728 --> 01:12:35,522
Help me! Help me!
Someone, please help me!

887
01:12:40,694 --> 01:12:42,822
<i>I'm telling you, Marcus.
I've seen it myself.</i>

888
01:12:42,905 --> 01:12:45,574
<i>There's something
very, very wrong</i>

889
01:12:45,657 --> 01:12:46,951
<i>going on inside of that house.</i>

890
01:12:47,034 --> 01:12:48,035
<i>If you don't believe me,</i>

891
01:12:48,118 --> 01:12:49,286
<i>-go there yourself.</i>
-Justine, stop.

892
01:12:49,369 --> 01:12:50,746
Here's the bottom line.

893
01:12:50,829 --> 01:12:52,248
Alex has been traumatized enough

894
01:12:52,331 --> 01:12:54,416
by the events of
the last two months,

895
01:12:54,499 --> 01:12:56,585
-as I'm sure you have.
<i>-Marcus...</i>

896
01:12:56,668 --> 01:12:58,879
Which is why I'm gonna
do you the courtesy

897
01:12:58,962 --> 01:13:00,923
of forgetting that this
phone call ever took place.

898
01:13:01,006 --> 01:13:04,385
<i>If a child's welfare is
questioned, by law...</i>

899
01:13:04,468 --> 01:13:05,553
-Justine.
<i>-...you have to refer it</i>

900
01:13:05,636 --> 01:13:07,138
<i>to CPS.</i>

901
01:13:07,221 --> 01:13:08,222
<i>By law.</i>

902
01:13:08,305 --> 01:13:09,806
Are you really
gonna take it there?

903
01:13:10,807 --> 01:13:12,309
Is this the corner
you're gonna put me in?

904
01:13:12,392 --> 01:13:14,728
<i>Just go make the house
call, Marcus. Just do that.</i>

905
01:13:14,811 --> 01:13:18,566
I'm not authorized to
just make house calls.

906
01:13:18,649 --> 01:13:20,776
<i>Well, you're a mandatory
reporter. You have to.</i>

907
01:13:21,485 --> 01:13:22,570
Okay, here's what I'll do.

908
01:13:22,653 --> 01:13:25,614
I'll invite his parents to
come in, have a talk with me.

909
01:13:25,697 --> 01:13:28,159
We'll have a face-to-face
at the school.

910
01:13:28,242 --> 01:13:29,869
Is that acceptable to you?

911
01:13:29,952 --> 01:13:32,455
<i>Yes, thank you. I would
really appreciate that.</i>

912
01:13:32,538 --> 01:13:35,082
Okay, then. You're
welcome. Goodbye.

913
01:13:37,543 --> 01:13:39,336
Yeah.

914
01:13:42,172 --> 01:13:43,632
Your two o'clock is here.

915
01:13:43,715 --> 01:13:44,925
That's fine.

916
01:13:48,554 --> 01:13:51,348
Well, send them
in, please, Marge.

917
01:13:53,976 --> 01:13:55,143
This way, ma'am.

918
01:14:08,740 --> 01:14:11,285
Principal Miller, I'm Gladys.

919
01:14:12,369 --> 01:14:14,496
Yes. H-Hi. Hi.

920
01:14:15,038 --> 01:14:16,039
Come on in.

921
01:14:16,790 --> 01:14:19,334
-Have a seat, please.
-Oh, thank you.

922
01:14:25,174 --> 01:14:26,175
Thank you, Marge.

923
01:14:30,470 --> 01:14:32,806
Thank you for coming in. I...

924
01:14:33,432 --> 01:14:36,060
I know you guys have had
a lot of attention lately.

925
01:14:36,143 --> 01:14:38,687
Not all of it could
possibly be wanted.

926
01:14:38,770 --> 01:14:41,065
I'm happy to come by. It's fine.

927
01:14:41,148 --> 01:14:42,858
Okay. Forgive me...

928
01:14:42,941 --> 01:14:44,860
We have not met. Is that right?

929
01:14:45,569 --> 01:14:46,862
No, I don't think so.

930
01:14:46,945 --> 01:14:48,489
Okay... Phew.

931
01:14:48,572 --> 01:14:52,242
Because I was relatively
certain I'd remember.

932
01:14:52,910 --> 01:14:55,204
I know I've met
Alex's father before.

933
01:14:55,287 --> 01:14:56,831
I'm Alex's aunt,

934
01:14:56,914 --> 01:14:58,415
and his mom's my baby sister.

935
01:14:58,498 --> 01:15:01,752
Okay. So you're not
his legal guardian.

936
01:15:01,835 --> 01:15:04,422
Well, no. That would be
his parents, of course.

937
01:15:04,505 --> 01:15:06,757
Okay. Well, uh...

938
01:15:06,840 --> 01:15:07,842
Forgive me, Gladys,

939
01:15:07,925 --> 01:15:11,886
but unfortunately, I need
to speak with his parents.

940
01:15:13,847 --> 01:15:15,766
Well, I hate to say it,

941
01:15:15,849 --> 01:15:18,727
but his parents have been
feeling unwell as of late,

942
01:15:18,810 --> 01:15:21,605
and I'm staying with them
to help take care of Alex.

943
01:15:21,688 --> 01:15:23,565
Oh. S-Sounds serious.

944
01:15:24,233 --> 01:15:26,318
Oh, no. No, it's not
serious. Nothing terminal.

945
01:15:26,401 --> 01:15:27,945
It's just a touch
of consumption.

946
01:15:28,028 --> 01:15:29,655
"A touch of consumption"?

947
01:15:30,322 --> 01:15:31,322
Yeah.

948
01:15:31,990 --> 01:15:33,242
You know what?

949
01:15:33,325 --> 01:15:34,410
I'm embarrassed to say

950
01:15:34,493 --> 01:15:36,912
I guess I don't really
know what that means.

951
01:15:37,412 --> 01:15:38,330
I thought it was something

952
01:15:38,413 --> 01:15:40,248
settlers got on
the Oregon Trail.

953
01:15:42,668 --> 01:15:44,670
-What is it? Tuberculosis?
-You know what?

954
01:15:44,753 --> 01:15:49,299
They are doing just fine,
but they need to stay home.

955
01:15:50,926 --> 01:15:53,596
I had hoped to speak to
them in person because...

956
01:15:53,679 --> 01:15:56,139
...this is awkward,

957
01:15:56,682 --> 01:15:59,852
but a concerned individual has
lodged a welfare complaint.

958
01:15:59,935 --> 01:16:01,854
And unfortunately, I
need to make contact

959
01:16:01,937 --> 01:16:04,148
with the child's legal guardian.

960
01:16:04,231 --> 01:16:06,525
It's something that's
not really negotiable.

961
01:16:06,608 --> 01:16:09,361
I need to speak with
their parents in person.

962
01:16:09,444 --> 01:16:10,863
Oh, dear.

963
01:16:10,946 --> 01:16:13,782
I could come over to the house
if that would make it easier.

964
01:16:14,575 --> 01:16:17,161
I'm just trying to
avoid involving CPS.

965
01:16:17,244 --> 01:16:18,788
-But frankly...
-CPS?

966
01:16:18,871 --> 01:16:20,998
...I'm not convinced
that anything is wrong.

967
01:16:21,081 --> 01:16:22,749
Who made the complaint?

968
01:16:23,500 --> 01:16:25,544
I'm not at liberty to say.

969
01:16:28,130 --> 01:16:29,965
Well, this is very upsetting.

970
01:16:30,048 --> 01:16:33,468
<i>It is now that all free
will has been lost.</i>

971
01:16:34,845 --> 01:16:36,639
<i>The ant moves
under the direction</i>

972
01:16:36,722 --> 01:16:39,099
<i>of a mind separate from its own.</i>

973
01:16:41,268 --> 01:16:42,770
<i>Here, the ant initiates
its death grip.</i>

974
01:16:42,853 --> 01:16:44,605
Yum, yum, yum.

975
01:16:44,688 --> 01:16:45,814
There we go.

976
01:16:48,442 --> 01:16:52,655
<i>As the parasitic Cordyceps
continue to feed off its body.</i>

977
01:16:52,738 --> 01:16:54,281
That's disgusting.

978
01:16:57,868 --> 01:16:59,870
<i>Fungal fruiting occurs next.</i>

979
01:17:01,663 --> 01:17:03,124
<i>Large blooms...</i>

980
01:17:03,207 --> 01:17:04,291
<i>...that serve to
spread more spores...</i>

981
01:17:04,374 --> 01:17:05,459
Who could that be?

982
01:17:08,086 --> 01:17:11,131
<i>...that will find more ants.</i>

983
01:17:11,757 --> 01:17:12,758
Ew.

984
01:17:18,388 --> 01:17:20,307
-Thank God you're home.
-Who is it?

985
01:17:21,141 --> 01:17:22,768
I'm so sorry to disturb
you on a Saturday.

986
01:17:22,851 --> 01:17:24,770
Oh, will you please,
please forgive me?

987
01:17:24,853 --> 01:17:26,147
We're just sitting down.

988
01:17:26,230 --> 01:17:28,816
The bus didn't pick me up
where it was scheduled to.

989
01:17:28,899 --> 01:17:30,900
And I had realized
far too late...

990
01:17:32,319 --> 01:17:34,321
...that I was standing
on the wrong corner.

991
01:17:34,404 --> 01:17:35,823
And by the time I
put that together,

992
01:17:35,906 --> 01:17:38,492
oh, I'd missed it entirely.

993
01:17:38,575 --> 01:17:42,371
So I had to walk all the
way across town to get here.

994
01:17:42,454 --> 01:17:43,914
Well, I'm so sorry
to hear that...

995
01:17:43,997 --> 01:17:46,000
I am sorry to tell
you this, sweetie,

996
01:17:46,083 --> 01:17:48,586
but I am on the
verge of collapse.

997
01:17:48,669 --> 01:17:49,669
Oh.

998
01:17:51,755 --> 01:17:53,590
Could I please have some water?

999
01:17:54,925 --> 01:17:55,843
I'm afraid that's re...

1000
01:17:55,926 --> 01:17:58,137
Of course you can
have some water.

1001
01:17:58,220 --> 01:17:59,430
Oh, thank you so much.

1002
01:17:59,513 --> 01:18:00,890
I'm afraid it's really not a...

1003
01:18:00,973 --> 01:18:02,767
My name's Gladys, it's
so nice to meet you.

1004
01:18:02,850 --> 01:18:03,934
Hi.

1005
01:18:04,643 --> 01:18:08,147
Oh! I absolutely
love this house.

1006
01:18:08,230 --> 01:18:11,066
Look, a giraffe and
a green Chinese la...

1007
01:18:11,149 --> 01:18:13,194
That's original in
there. I bet it is.

1008
01:18:13,277 --> 01:18:15,488
Oh, I just love this kitchen.

1009
01:18:15,571 --> 01:18:19,156
Clean, white cabinets.
How I'm envious of that.

1010
01:18:20,993 --> 01:18:23,204
Now, listen. I know
that it's inconvenient,

1011
01:18:23,287 --> 01:18:24,997
but I really needed
to speak to you

1012
01:18:25,080 --> 01:18:26,999
about our conversation
yesterday.

1013
01:18:27,082 --> 01:18:28,749
Oh.

1014
01:18:29,710 --> 01:18:31,212
Marcus, get her a glass.

1015
01:18:31,295 --> 01:18:33,046
A bowl, please.

1016
01:18:35,132 --> 01:18:36,050
A bowl?

1017
01:18:36,133 --> 01:18:38,636
Yes, a bowl. It's a
peculiarity of mine.

1018
01:18:38,719 --> 01:18:40,888
I don't even try to
rationalize it anymore.

1019
01:18:43,891 --> 01:18:46,685
A bowl of water. Okay.

1020
01:18:46,768 --> 01:18:47,853
Thank you.

1021
01:18:47,936 --> 01:18:50,397
I-I wanted you to know that
I talked to Alex's father,

1022
01:18:50,480 --> 01:18:52,316
who's very ill, as I said.

1023
01:18:52,399 --> 01:18:54,568
But the good news is,
he's more than happy

1024
01:18:54,651 --> 01:18:57,071
to come in Monday,
sit down with you

1025
01:18:57,154 --> 01:18:58,530
and clear everything up.

1026
01:18:59,573 --> 01:19:02,409
I appreciate that, but
it really is unnecessary.

1027
01:19:02,492 --> 01:19:04,829
So there's no need to contact
the authorities, right?

1028
01:19:04,912 --> 01:19:05,912
That's, uh...

1029
01:19:06,538 --> 01:19:07,748
Sure, I guess not.

1030
01:19:07,831 --> 01:19:10,084
I mean, you haven't
contacted them yet, right?

1031
01:19:10,167 --> 01:19:13,086
Gladys, I'm really gonna have
to insist that you, uh...

1032
01:19:15,422 --> 01:19:17,132
Is... Is that my ribbon?

1033
01:19:19,718 --> 01:19:21,929
You haven't contacted
them, right?

1034
01:19:22,971 --> 01:19:24,806
No, I haven't. What is this?

1035
01:19:27,392 --> 01:19:28,310
Oh, my God!

1036
01:19:28,393 --> 01:19:30,813
Whoops! Look what I
did. Oh, my goodness.

1037
01:19:30,896 --> 01:19:32,440
Why did you do that?

1038
01:19:32,523 --> 01:19:34,650
Well, it was an
accident, of course.

1039
01:19:34,733 --> 01:19:36,861
Wow. That's really bleeding.

1040
01:19:36,944 --> 01:19:38,028
Terry, go get the alcohol

1041
01:19:38,111 --> 01:19:39,572
-and the first aid kit.
-Okay.

1042
01:19:39,655 --> 01:19:41,991
Oh, no, no, no. That's nonsense.

1043
01:19:42,074 --> 01:19:44,659
Could you get me a rag, sweetie?

1044
01:19:53,794 --> 01:19:54,795
I think she cut my hair!

1045
01:19:54,878 --> 01:19:56,005
I'm calling 911.

1046
01:19:56,088 --> 01:19:57,882
Marcus, I think she cut my hair!

1047
01:19:57,965 --> 01:20:00,342
Marcus, what did she do?

1048
01:20:11,812 --> 01:20:12,813
Marcus?

1049
01:20:16,775 --> 01:20:17,776
Marcus?

1050
01:20:50,142 --> 01:20:51,393
Well...

1051
01:22:09,096 --> 01:22:10,137
Look!

1052
01:22:12,474 --> 01:22:13,892
Yo, what the fuck, man?

1053
01:22:17,771 --> 01:22:18,771
Oh, my God.

1054
01:22:26,613 --> 01:22:28,324
Come out with it. Just
think of the kids.

1055
01:22:28,407 --> 01:22:29,992
-Stop thinking of yourself!
-Marcus?

1056
01:22:30,075 --> 01:22:31,993
You and I are gonna have a...

1057
01:22:52,055 --> 01:22:53,056
Stay down.

1058
01:22:55,726 --> 01:22:57,144
Hey! Stop! No!

1059
01:22:58,562 --> 01:23:00,272
Oh, my God.

1060
01:23:00,355 --> 01:23:02,358
Help me, please. Please.

1061
01:23:02,441 --> 01:23:04,233
Oh, God. No!

1062
01:23:11,575 --> 01:23:12,575
Oh, my God.

1063
01:23:20,876 --> 01:23:22,002
Hey!

1064
01:23:24,838 --> 01:23:25,838
Oh, my...

1065
01:23:34,973 --> 01:23:37,225
-Get out of my store!
-Fucking help me!

1066
01:24:01,959 --> 01:24:03,043
What the fuck?

1067
01:24:09,883 --> 01:24:10,884
Motherfucker.

1068
01:24:21,812 --> 01:24:23,814
Come on, you piece of shit.

1069
01:25:27,586 --> 01:25:28,587
Are you okay?

1070
01:25:29,713 --> 01:25:31,673
Yeah, I think so.

1071
01:25:32,466 --> 01:25:33,467
I'm just, uh...

1072
01:25:34,593 --> 01:25:35,594
scraped up.

1073
01:25:36,303 --> 01:25:37,304
You?

1074
01:25:39,348 --> 01:25:40,349
The same.

1075
01:25:41,850 --> 01:25:43,018
I-I wanna thank you.

1076
01:25:43,101 --> 01:25:45,020
-Ah...
-No, I do. So, thank you.

1077
01:25:47,439 --> 01:25:48,440
Sure.

1078
01:25:48,982 --> 01:25:50,442
I mean, what else could I do?

1079
01:25:53,195 --> 01:25:54,530
Guy was out of control.

1080
01:25:55,447 --> 01:25:58,576
The last time I talked
to him, he was fine.

1081
01:25:58,659 --> 01:26:00,202
I mean, he really was.

1082
01:26:02,329 --> 01:26:05,457
I've never seen anything
like that in my life.

1083
01:26:06,500 --> 01:26:07,501
I have.

1084
01:26:08,335 --> 01:26:09,670
What are you talking about?

1085
01:26:11,046 --> 01:26:13,507
The way he was running,
I've seen that before.

1086
01:26:17,553 --> 01:26:18,804
Can I show you something?

1087
01:26:20,138 --> 01:26:22,933
Their little girl ran
the same way Matthew did.

1088
01:26:23,016 --> 01:26:25,269
Same posture, same exact way.

1089
01:26:25,352 --> 01:26:28,105
Just like Marcus
ran after you today.

1090
01:26:28,188 --> 01:26:29,565
He was weaponized.

1091
01:26:29,648 --> 01:26:32,901
Like a heat-seeking missile
just locked onto you.

1092
01:26:33,694 --> 01:26:36,238
So, here. Look at
this. This is my house.

1093
01:26:36,321 --> 01:26:37,907
This is Bailey Kramer's house.

1094
01:26:37,990 --> 01:26:40,117
Now, if you assume they were
heading in a straight line

1095
01:26:40,200 --> 01:26:42,203
at just some target of theirs,

1096
01:26:42,286 --> 01:26:44,580
and you assume they both
had the same target,

1097
01:26:44,663 --> 01:26:47,249
those lines intersect
somewhere around here.

1098
01:26:47,332 --> 01:26:48,167
Oh, my God.

1099
01:26:48,250 --> 01:26:49,627
There must be something
about this area.

1100
01:26:49,710 --> 01:26:52,004
-Alex.
-Some... What?

1101
01:26:52,713 --> 01:26:55,090
Alex Lilly lives in this house.

1102
01:27:01,054 --> 01:27:04,224
Who else can think of an
example of a parasite?

1103
01:27:04,766 --> 01:27:05,767
Anyone?

1104
01:27:06,727 --> 01:27:08,395
-Lisa?
-A tapeworm.

1105
01:27:08,478 --> 01:27:10,689
A tapeworm! Very good!

1106
01:27:10,772 --> 01:27:12,358
That's a gross one, right?

1107
01:27:12,441 --> 01:27:16,068
It lives in your intestines
and it eats your food.

1108
01:27:20,657 --> 01:27:21,784
Stop it.

1109
01:27:21,867 --> 01:27:22,951
"Stop it."

1110
01:27:24,369 --> 01:27:27,789
"Stop it."

1111
01:27:29,041 --> 01:27:30,083
"Stop it."

1112
01:27:46,558 --> 01:27:47,726
What's up, Axe Man?

1113
01:27:50,687 --> 01:27:53,023
Talk to me, Axe Man.
How was school today?

1114
01:27:53,941 --> 01:27:56,360
-Good.
-Good? Kiss any supermodels?

1115
01:27:56,443 --> 01:27:57,903
No.

1116
01:27:57,986 --> 01:27:59,738
No? All right.

1117
01:28:01,448 --> 01:28:03,492
Well, tonight's the night, pal.

1118
01:28:04,076 --> 01:28:06,537
Your mom's aunt Gladys
is coming, remember?

1119
01:28:07,496 --> 01:28:10,499
Why do we have to have
her live at our house?

1120
01:28:11,124 --> 01:28:13,126
'Cause it's like
we talked about.

1121
01:28:13,710 --> 01:28:17,673
She's sick, and she doesn't
have anywhere else to go.

1122
01:28:19,424 --> 01:28:21,343
But I don't even
know her, though.

1123
01:28:21,426 --> 01:28:24,096
Pfft. I hear you, bud.
I don't know her either.

1124
01:28:24,805 --> 01:28:27,600
To be honest, I'm not sure
your mom knows her that well.

1125
01:28:27,683 --> 01:28:31,144
But she's family.
Family's important.

1126
01:28:32,062 --> 01:28:33,605
We gotta help each other out.

1127
01:28:34,314 --> 01:28:35,899
Hey, found a kid.

1128
01:28:36,400 --> 01:28:39,445
Hey. My men have returned.

1129
01:28:39,528 --> 01:28:40,529
-Hi.
-Hi.

1130
01:28:40,612 --> 01:28:42,698
Whoa. Hey. Good day at school?

1131
01:28:42,781 --> 01:28:44,366
-Yeah.
-Okay, good.

1132
01:28:44,449 --> 01:28:47,036
Uh, I would really like to
get this house cleaned up

1133
01:28:47,119 --> 01:28:48,662
before your aunt
Gladys gets here.

1134
01:28:48,745 --> 01:28:50,414
So do me a favor, get
your room cleaned up

1135
01:28:50,497 --> 01:28:52,041
before you start your homework.

1136
01:28:52,124 --> 01:28:54,168
She's not coming
in my room, is she?

1137
01:28:54,918 --> 01:28:56,087
I'd really like a clean house.

1138
01:28:56,170 --> 01:28:58,463
That includes your
room, so let's go.

1139
01:28:59,423 --> 01:29:02,676
I know. It's horrible
cleaning up after yourself.

1140
01:29:30,329 --> 01:29:31,538
All right?

1141
01:29:38,212 --> 01:29:40,047
Hi! Come in!

1142
01:29:40,130 --> 01:29:42,091
-Got the door?
-I got it.

1143
01:29:42,174 --> 01:29:44,092
One more step.

1144
01:29:55,771 --> 01:29:58,357
I'm just saying she
looks really bad.

1145
01:29:58,440 --> 01:29:59,692
I don't know if this
is the place for...

1146
01:29:59,775 --> 01:30:02,069
Yeah, well, it's either here
or out on the street, Stephen.

1147
01:30:02,152 --> 01:30:05,656
Well, you know, this ain't
a hospice place, hon.

1148
01:30:05,739 --> 01:30:06,782
I know that. I know.

1149
01:30:06,865 --> 01:30:08,742
We're not equipped for this
kind of thing. All right?

1150
01:30:08,825 --> 01:30:11,036
We hadn't seen this
woman in 15 years.

1151
01:30:11,119 --> 01:30:12,538
She didn't even show
up to our wedding...

1152
01:30:12,621 --> 01:30:13,914
Look, my mom would
do this for her,

1153
01:30:13,997 --> 01:30:16,292
so I'm gonna do
this for her, okay?

1154
01:30:16,375 --> 01:30:17,626
I could really use your support.

1155
01:30:17,709 --> 01:30:19,002
If at any point you feel like...

1156
01:30:19,545 --> 01:30:21,505
Alex, honey, what are you doing?

1157
01:30:21,588 --> 01:30:22,631
I'm hungry.

1158
01:30:22,714 --> 01:30:24,300
Oh, you're hungry.
Okay. All right.

1159
01:30:24,383 --> 01:30:25,551
Well, go downstairs, eat up

1160
01:30:25,634 --> 01:30:28,262
and then go brush your teeth,
okay? It's almost 7:30.

1161
01:30:28,345 --> 01:30:31,056
And be quiet back there.
Your aunt Gladys is sleeping.

1162
01:31:24,484 --> 01:31:26,612
How long is she
gonna stay with us?

1163
01:31:29,072 --> 01:31:30,532
Hard to say, pal.

1164
01:31:31,617 --> 01:31:33,785
Doesn't look like she's
getting much better.

1165
01:31:35,078 --> 01:31:37,206
So she's gonna stay
with us forever?

1166
01:31:37,289 --> 01:31:38,541
No.

1167
01:31:38,624 --> 01:31:39,667
I...

1168
01:31:39,750 --> 01:31:41,960
I don't think she'll be
here longer than a month.

1169
01:31:55,933 --> 01:31:57,768
-All righty, man.
-All righty.

1170
01:31:57,851 --> 01:31:59,019
I'll pick you up at 2:00, okay?

1171
01:31:59,102 --> 01:32:00,771
-See ya.
-See ya.

1172
01:32:00,854 --> 01:32:02,606
-I love you.
-Love ya.

1173
01:32:06,568 --> 01:32:08,529
That's time. Pencils down.

1174
01:32:09,863 --> 01:32:11,031
Matthew!

1175
01:32:11,114 --> 01:32:12,366
What? You said, "Pencils down."

1176
01:32:12,449 --> 01:32:14,076
Matthew, outside now.

1177
01:32:14,159 --> 01:32:15,369
Alex, are you okay?

1178
01:32:15,452 --> 01:32:16,829
I'm fine.

1179
01:32:16,912 --> 01:32:19,206
Matthew, let's go. Get your bag.

1180
01:32:19,957 --> 01:32:22,209
It was a joke. Oh, my God!

1181
01:32:43,605 --> 01:32:45,649
-You miss your ride, son?
-I'm okay.

1182
01:32:45,732 --> 01:32:46,817
You sure?

1183
01:33:36,033 --> 01:33:40,746
Mom, Dad, where were you?

1184
01:33:41,830 --> 01:33:44,917
Hey, Axe Man. How was school?

1185
01:33:46,251 --> 01:33:47,252
What's wrong?

1186
01:33:48,003 --> 01:33:49,171
Alex?

1187
01:33:49,963 --> 01:33:52,089
Oh, welcome home.

1188
01:33:53,050 --> 01:33:54,676
How are you, sweetie?

1189
01:33:57,179 --> 01:33:58,514
Let me take a look at you.

1190
01:33:58,597 --> 01:33:59,598
Oh, you know, I haven't seen you

1191
01:33:59,681 --> 01:34:01,725
since you were a
little teeny baby.

1192
01:34:01,808 --> 01:34:03,144
What's wrong with my parents?

1193
01:34:03,227 --> 01:34:05,771
Oh, nothing, sweetheart.
They're just fine.

1194
01:34:05,854 --> 01:34:07,189
Mom.

1195
01:34:09,024 --> 01:34:11,902
Hey. How was school?

1196
01:34:11,985 --> 01:34:14,863
You see? I told you, she's
just fine. Don't worry.

1197
01:34:17,115 --> 01:34:18,116
Alex.

1198
01:34:19,201 --> 01:34:20,494
Now, don't be rude.

1199
01:34:21,745 --> 01:34:23,080
Why don't you sit
down at the table?

1200
01:34:23,163 --> 01:34:24,748
'Cause I'm making dinner.
I should have asked you,

1201
01:34:24,831 --> 01:34:25,916
but you weren't here,

1202
01:34:25,999 --> 01:34:27,793
so I thought mac
and cheese would...

1203
01:34:28,585 --> 01:34:29,670
Dad!

1204
01:34:29,753 --> 01:34:31,922
Alex, that's it.

1205
01:34:32,005 --> 01:34:34,175
I want you to go
upstairs, wash your face,

1206
01:34:34,258 --> 01:34:35,843
brush your teeth, and
then it is bedtime.

1207
01:34:35,926 --> 01:34:37,052
No dinner for you.

1208
01:34:40,430 --> 01:34:41,974
I'm not kidding, young man. Go.

1209
01:35:19,178 --> 01:35:20,679
Come. Sit.

1210
01:35:30,856 --> 01:35:31,857
Alex.

1211
01:35:32,524 --> 01:35:33,567
Sit.

1212
01:35:39,364 --> 01:35:40,950
Don't worry about your parents.

1213
01:35:41,033 --> 01:35:42,409
They're just resting.

1214
01:35:46,663 --> 01:35:49,917
Now, before you go to school
today, I want you to promise

1215
01:35:50,000 --> 01:35:53,212
that you will not tell a
living soul that I am here

1216
01:35:54,213 --> 01:35:56,548
or that your parents are
resting like they are.

1217
01:36:00,177 --> 01:36:01,428
Do you hear me, Alex?

1218
01:36:08,352 --> 01:36:09,353
Watch.

1219
01:36:12,147 --> 01:36:13,232
Ooh.

1220
01:36:23,534 --> 01:36:24,910
Are you watching?

1221
01:36:36,255 --> 01:36:37,548
Stop!

1222
01:36:38,632 --> 01:36:39,800
Stop, Dad!

1223
01:36:42,261 --> 01:36:43,428
Alex.

1224
01:36:52,604 --> 01:36:53,647
Sit down.

1225
01:37:05,284 --> 01:37:07,411
Now, when I tell you
that you are not to speak

1226
01:37:07,494 --> 01:37:10,455
about me or your
parents to anyone...

1227
01:37:12,082 --> 01:37:15,377
you understand what can happen
if you break your promise.

1228
01:37:18,714 --> 01:37:20,382
I can make your parents
hurt themselves.

1229
01:37:20,465 --> 01:37:22,467
I can make them hurt each other.

1230
01:37:25,721 --> 01:37:28,515
I can make them eat
each other if I want to.

1231
01:37:32,352 --> 01:37:34,021
Do I want to, Alex?

1232
01:37:36,648 --> 01:37:38,066
Do you believe me?

1233
01:37:42,237 --> 01:37:43,489
Promise you will
not talk about me

1234
01:37:43,572 --> 01:37:45,991
to another human being. Say it.

1235
01:37:47,451 --> 01:37:48,577
I promise.

1236
01:37:50,329 --> 01:37:51,705
'Cause I'll know, Alex.

1237
01:37:54,917 --> 01:37:56,668
Go to school. Take the bus.

1238
01:38:56,353 --> 01:38:57,729
No talking today.

1239
01:38:59,398 --> 01:39:00,399
Good boy.

1240
01:39:01,859 --> 01:39:03,068
You'll need to
feed your parents.

1241
01:39:03,151 --> 01:39:04,653
There's soup in the cabinet.

1242
01:39:06,822 --> 01:39:08,490
Tomorrow, you'll get some more.

1243
01:39:53,827 --> 01:39:54,995
Alex.

1244
01:39:59,625 --> 01:40:00,626
Alex?

1245
01:40:23,649 --> 01:40:24,942
Come here, sweetie.

1246
01:40:31,573 --> 01:40:32,616
Oh.

1247
01:40:36,328 --> 01:40:38,038
I'm very sick, Alex.

1248
01:40:40,374 --> 01:40:42,125
Would you like some water?

1249
01:40:42,960 --> 01:40:44,545
Well, water won't help me.

1250
01:40:45,671 --> 01:40:47,381
I'm too sick for water.

1251
01:40:48,590 --> 01:40:50,759
I have been for
a very long time.

1252
01:40:52,469 --> 01:40:53,929
What will make you better?

1253
01:40:56,723 --> 01:40:58,267
Well, I was hoping
your mom and dad

1254
01:40:58,350 --> 01:40:59,560
would make me feel better,

1255
01:40:59,643 --> 01:41:02,396
but it doesn't seem to
be turning out so good.

1256
01:41:03,105 --> 01:41:05,190
Would you like to
go to a hospital?

1257
01:41:05,983 --> 01:41:08,068
Hospital won't fix me.

1258
01:41:13,657 --> 01:41:15,034
But maybe you could, though.

1259
01:41:15,117 --> 01:41:16,493
You could help.

1260
01:41:17,369 --> 01:41:18,370
How?

1261
01:41:19,246 --> 01:41:20,414
Well, at school,

1262
01:41:21,582 --> 01:41:25,085
bring an object from each of
your classmates home to me.

1263
01:41:26,170 --> 01:41:27,337
That might work.

1264
01:41:28,714 --> 01:41:30,299
How will that make you better?

1265
01:41:34,011 --> 01:41:36,138
It might be just what I need.

1266
01:41:39,308 --> 01:41:41,810
And if you got better,
you'd go back home?

1267
01:41:45,772 --> 01:41:47,274
If I got better...

1268
01:41:49,610 --> 01:41:51,028
I'd go back home.

1269
01:42:52,005 --> 01:42:53,006
Alex.

1270
01:42:54,967 --> 01:42:56,427
What are you doing in here?

1271
01:42:56,510 --> 01:42:59,054
Um, I didn't feel like playing,

1272
01:42:59,137 --> 01:43:01,223
and I forgot something.

1273
01:43:02,641 --> 01:43:04,601
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hey, hey, hey.

1274
01:43:08,063 --> 01:43:09,064
Are you okay?

1275
01:43:09,690 --> 01:43:11,149
-Yeah.
-Yeah?

1276
01:43:12,109 --> 01:43:14,778
You've been awful quiet lately.

1277
01:43:15,445 --> 01:43:16,613
Quieter than usual.

1278
01:43:17,281 --> 01:43:18,323
How are you doing?

1279
01:43:18,866 --> 01:43:21,326
I'm okay. I just
forgot something.

1280
01:43:22,244 --> 01:43:23,245
It's okay.

1281
01:43:25,372 --> 01:43:26,749
Alex, you know,

1282
01:43:26,832 --> 01:43:29,543
if... you ever want
to talk to someone,

1283
01:43:30,043 --> 01:43:31,461
you can always talk to me.

1284
01:43:33,046 --> 01:43:34,173
Do you know that?

1285
01:43:34,256 --> 01:43:35,341
Yeah.

1286
01:43:35,424 --> 01:43:37,759
You can talk to me
about anything you want.

1287
01:43:41,263 --> 01:43:42,639
I wanna go back now.

1288
01:43:44,558 --> 01:43:46,518
Okay. Go play.

1289
01:44:43,825 --> 01:44:45,077
What are you doing?

1290
01:46:33,143 --> 01:46:34,228
No...

1291
01:46:44,029 --> 01:46:46,198
<i>Stephen here suffered a
stroke a little while back,</i>

1292
01:46:46,281 --> 01:46:48,075
<i>so he's unable to speak.</i>

1293
01:46:48,158 --> 01:46:50,827
<i>And I'm taking care of the
family for the time being.</i>

1294
01:46:51,328 --> 01:46:52,955
I'm glad you both are here.

1295
01:46:53,038 --> 01:46:55,166
Alex, how are you doing, pal?

1296
01:46:55,249 --> 01:46:56,500
I'm okay.

1297
01:46:56,583 --> 01:46:58,127
Now, we're gonna ask
you some questions

1298
01:46:58,210 --> 01:47:00,128
about what happened
at school, okay?

1299
01:47:02,464 --> 01:47:04,299
Tomorrow, people will come here.

1300
01:47:05,926 --> 01:47:07,845
And they will
search this house...

1301
01:47:12,516 --> 01:47:14,309
and we have to be ready.

1302
01:47:33,662 --> 01:47:35,122
Detective, come in!

1303
01:47:35,205 --> 01:47:36,207
Good morning, Ms. Lilly.

1304
01:47:36,290 --> 01:47:37,458
-How are you today?
-Fine.

1305
01:47:37,541 --> 01:47:39,293
-Good to see you again.
-Nice to see you too.

1306
01:47:39,376 --> 01:47:41,003
-Remember Detective Colbert?
-Oh, yes.

1307
01:47:41,086 --> 01:47:43,464
We just wanted to come by the
house for a few minutes today

1308
01:47:43,547 --> 01:47:44,757
and look around, uh,

1309
01:47:44,840 --> 01:47:47,718
see the environment that
Alex has been living in.

1310
01:47:47,801 --> 01:47:51,263
And just get an idea of what
the family dynamic is like.

1311
01:47:51,346 --> 01:47:53,516
-Okay!
-Oh. Thank you.

1312
01:47:53,599 --> 01:47:54,600
And... Oh.

1313
01:47:54,683 --> 01:47:56,602
Hey, Alex. How are
you doing today?

1314
01:47:57,644 --> 01:47:58,813
He's a little
quiet today, right?

1315
01:47:58,896 --> 01:48:00,689
-Mm-hmm. Yes, he is.
-Okay.

1316
01:49:05,128 --> 01:49:06,213
Hello?

1317
01:49:15,013 --> 01:49:17,182
Pack your things, Alex,
we're leaving tomorrow.

1318
01:49:20,352 --> 01:49:21,979
Don't step over the salt.

1319
01:49:54,970 --> 01:49:57,389
The cops are here. What
do you think that means?

1320
01:49:59,766 --> 01:50:00,809
I don't know.

1321
01:50:02,144 --> 01:50:03,479
Do we knock? Do we come back?

1322
01:50:03,562 --> 01:50:05,105
Maybe we knock.

1323
01:50:05,606 --> 01:50:08,317
And say what? What...
What are we gonna explain?

1324
01:50:11,320 --> 01:50:12,113
Yeah, I don't know.

1325
01:50:12,196 --> 01:50:13,322
-Let's just...
-Here we go.

1326
01:50:14,948 --> 01:50:16,158
Hey, what is this?

1327
01:50:29,171 --> 01:50:30,214
Is that the cop?

1328
01:50:31,548 --> 01:50:32,967
That's Paul.

1329
01:50:33,050 --> 01:50:35,093
-You know him?
-Yeah.

1330
01:51:15,676 --> 01:51:16,677
Hello?

1331
01:51:31,859 --> 01:51:32,860
Paul?

1332
01:51:46,206 --> 01:51:48,626
Paul, what are you
doing back there?

1333
01:51:48,709 --> 01:51:49,709
Wait.

1334
01:52:35,714 --> 01:52:37,256
Fuck! Fuck!

1335
01:52:38,634 --> 01:52:39,968
Stay fucking back!

1336
01:52:49,978 --> 01:52:51,063
Paul.

1337
01:52:51,146 --> 01:52:52,397
Paul, stop.

1338
01:52:53,315 --> 01:52:54,316
Stop!

1339
01:53:18,632 --> 01:53:19,675
God.

1340
01:53:22,094 --> 01:53:23,345
Goddamn it.

1341
01:53:41,572 --> 01:53:43,323
You goddamn freaky little...

1342
01:54:25,282 --> 01:54:27,993
Paul. Please.

1343
01:54:33,624 --> 01:54:34,625
Please.

1344
01:55:24,174 --> 01:55:25,175
Matthew?

1345
01:55:26,760 --> 01:55:27,761
Matthew!

1346
01:55:29,137 --> 01:55:30,138
No.

1347
01:55:30,764 --> 01:55:31,765
Matthew.

1348
01:55:33,225 --> 01:55:34,225
No.

1349
01:56:05,841 --> 01:56:06,842
Matthew?

1350
01:56:07,342 --> 01:56:08,385
Come on.

1351
01:56:10,387 --> 01:56:11,430
Matthew?

1352
01:56:13,307 --> 01:56:14,308
Who...

1353
01:56:53,138 --> 01:56:55,223
That's good. Just like that.

1354
01:57:07,361 --> 01:57:09,613
That's the way.

1355
01:57:13,033 --> 01:57:14,201
Oh, no.

1356
01:58:00,080 --> 01:58:01,206
Oh, God!

1357
01:59:01,642 --> 01:59:04,727
Get off of me! Get off of me!

1358
01:59:53,402 --> 01:59:54,403
Matthew?

1359
02:00:17,009 --> 02:00:17,885
Honey, look outside.

1360
02:00:17,968 --> 02:00:19,470
Look what they did to the yard.

1361
02:00:19,553 --> 02:00:21,889
Jeremy, there's
glass everywhere.

1362
02:00:21,972 --> 02:00:23,724
Find her shoe! My god!

1363
02:00:23,807 --> 02:00:25,226
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

1364
02:00:25,309 --> 02:00:27,101
Now there's a man
in the kitchen!

1365
02:00:33,233 --> 02:00:34,318
Alex?

1366
02:01:18,070 --> 02:01:19,071
Matthew?

1367
02:01:30,958 --> 02:01:32,376
Oh, I found you.

1368
02:01:39,132 --> 02:01:40,384
<i>Alex's parents are still</i>

1369
02:01:40,467 --> 02:01:42,386
<i>being fed soup somewhere.</i>

1370
02:01:42,970 --> 02:01:44,263
<i>But not by him.</i>

1371
02:01:46,265 --> 02:01:49,142
<i>He moved to another town and
lives with a different aunt.</i>

1372
02:01:50,477 --> 02:01:53,021
<i>I heard that one is a nice lady.</i>

1373
02:01:55,399 --> 02:01:57,317
<i>All of the kids from his class</i>

1374
02:01:57,943 --> 02:01:59,987
<i>got reunited with their parents.</i>

1375
02:02:01,989 --> 02:02:05,158
<i>Some of them even started
talking again this year.</i>
