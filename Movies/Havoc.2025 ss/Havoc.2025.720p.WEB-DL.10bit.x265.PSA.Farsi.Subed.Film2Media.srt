1
00:00:29,541 --> 00:00:31,125
<i>You live in this world,</i>

2
00:00:32,041 --> 00:00:33,249
<i>you make choices.</i>

3
00:00:37,125 --> 00:00:39,250
<i>Choices
you try to justify.</i>

4
00:00:45,166 --> 00:00:48,333
<i>For yourself,
for your family.</i>

5
00:01:00,458 --> 00:01:02,166
<i>And for a
while, it works.</i>

6
00:01:07,333 --> 00:01:08,916
<i>Until it doesn't.</i>

7
00:01:18,041 --> 00:01:21,666
<i>Until you make a choice that
renders everything worthless.</i>

8
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,750
<i>One you can't justify.</i>

9
00:01:31,916 --> 00:01:33,290
<i>Can't forgive.</i>

10
00:01:37,083 --> 00:01:39,791
<i>And it takes everything.</i>

11
00:01:42,250 --> 00:01:43,500
<i>Your family.</i>

12
00:01:46,916 --> 00:01:47,916
<i>Your friends.</i>

13
00:01:54,125 --> 00:01:55,166
<i>Your self.</i>

14
00:02:04,041 --> 00:02:06,458
<i>And then all you're
left with is nothing.</i>

15
00:02:09,083 --> 00:02:12,040
<i>Nothing but ghosts.</i>

16
00:02:33,541 --> 00:02:36,666
<i>Pull
over! Stop the truck now!</i>

17
00:02:37,166 --> 00:02:39,166
Pull me in!

18
00:02:57,583 --> 00:03:00,833
<i>Stop your
vehicle! Stop your vehicle now!</i>

19
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:06,707
This is fucked.
This is so fucked!

20
00:03:08,625 --> 00:03:11,083
<i>Pull over.</i>

21
00:03:15,333 --> 00:03:17,874
Oh shit! Mia, this side!

22
00:03:25,541 --> 00:03:26,540
Look out!

23
00:03:35,708 --> 00:03:38,540
- Fuck! Pull me in!
- Dude, fucking hell!

24
00:03:38,541 --> 00:03:40,040
Get in, Johnny!

25
00:03:40,041 --> 00:03:42,124
Fuck.

26
00:03:53,125 --> 00:03:56,166
<i>Stop,
or we will open fire!</i>

27
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:07,290
- Gotta lose 'em!
- I'm fucking trying, Charlie!

28
00:04:07,291 --> 00:04:08,791
Well, try harder.

29
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:21,625
Fucking punch it. Go. Floor it!

30
00:04:32,166 --> 00:04:34,208
They're headed
for the fucking freeway.

31
00:04:34,916 --> 00:04:36,624
Go!

32
00:04:36,625 --> 00:04:38,624
Come on!

33
00:05:43,958 --> 00:05:45,416
Oh fuck.

34
00:06:00,333 --> 00:06:01,333
Oh God!

35
00:06:03,416 --> 00:06:05,249
- Jake!
- I can't get him out.

36
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:07,333
He's fucking breathing
that shit in.

37
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,041
Vince,
what happened?

38
00:06:11,625 --> 00:06:12,625
Oh God.

39
00:06:19,041 --> 00:06:20,625
Fuck. Fuck!

40
00:06:24,875 --> 00:06:26,457
Zero-six-four.

41
00:06:26,458 --> 00:06:29,707
Officer Cortez down.
Repeat, Officer Cortez down.

42
00:06:29,708 --> 00:06:34,041
We need immediate medical assistance.
We're on Amherst and 16th.

43
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:40,708
Is this all you got?

44
00:06:41,291 --> 00:06:44,958
Well, yeah. If you're gonna leave
it this late, what do you expect?

45
00:06:50,083 --> 00:06:52,415
<i>Earlier tonight,
the District Attorney announced</i>

46
00:06:52,416 --> 00:06:53,707
<i>they'd be dropping all charges</i>

47
00:06:53,708 --> 00:06:57,082
<i>against mayoral candidate and real
estate mogul, Lawrence Beaumont.</i>

48
00:06:57,083 --> 00:07:02,624
<i>I'm relieved that DA Collins
has finally come to his senses</i>

49
00:07:02,625 --> 00:07:07,833
<i>and realizes that I'm a part of
the solution, not the problem.</i>

50
00:07:08,416 --> 00:07:11,082
- They're all fucking crooked.
- Yeah, no shit.

51
00:07:11,083 --> 00:07:13,915
<i>This once fine city
has become a cesspit of crime,</i>

52
00:07:13,916 --> 00:07:15,832
<i>our streets are
awash with drugs,</i>

53
00:07:15,833 --> 00:07:18,624
<i>and he has the temerity to
accuse me of criminality.</i>

54
00:07:18,625 --> 00:07:21,582
- <i>The indictment...</i>
- Can you wrap all of these, please?

55
00:07:23,208 --> 00:07:25,125
You want me to wrap all this?

56
00:07:25,958 --> 00:07:26,790
Yeah.

57
00:07:26,791 --> 00:07:29,208
Where the fuck do you
think you are, FAO Schwarz?

58
00:07:31,041 --> 00:07:32,708
All right, just give
me a fucking bag.

59
00:07:34,875 --> 00:07:37,290
No, it's supposed to be a
surprise for under the tree.

60
00:07:37,291 --> 00:07:39,540
How's it gonna be a surprise,
you see through the bag?

61
00:07:39,541 --> 00:07:42,832
Oh, I'm sorry. I've got a newspaper,
but you'll have to pay for that.

62
00:07:42,833 --> 00:07:45,833
Give me the newspaper, some Scotch
tape, I'll wrap it my fucking self.

63
00:07:46,958 --> 00:07:49,040
- How much?
- Thirty bucks.

64
00:07:49,041 --> 00:07:51,333
The deal of the century
for Father of the Year.

65
00:07:53,166 --> 00:07:54,708
- Wow.
- Wow.

66
00:07:56,208 --> 00:07:57,208
Thanks.

67
00:07:59,166 --> 00:08:00,541
Merry Christmas.

68
00:08:03,666 --> 00:08:05,415
{\an8}<i>...supports our campaign.</i>

69
00:08:05,416 --> 00:08:08,041
{\an8}<i>Support our campaign
for urban regeneration.</i>

70
00:08:11,833 --> 00:08:14,124
Hey. Yo.
It's, uh, it's me.

71
00:08:14,125 --> 00:08:16,540
Yeah, I called you earlier,
but you didn't pick up.

72
00:08:16,541 --> 00:08:17,707
<i>And?</i>

73
00:08:17,708 --> 00:08:20,916
And, uh, I got a little
something for Emmy, uh,

74
00:08:21,708 --> 00:08:22,999
and it's wrapped.

75
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,290
<i>Father of the Year.</i>

76
00:08:24,291 --> 00:08:27,540
Yeah, I heard that. I was
thinking maybe I could come over.

77
00:08:27,541 --> 00:08:30,249
- I could give it to her myself.
<i>- You know what time it is?</i>

78
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:31,999
- Yeah, it's ten o'clock.
<i>- She's six.</i>

79
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,707
<i>Six-year-olds go
to sleep at 7:00.</i>

80
00:08:33,708 --> 00:08:35,790
Nah. Not at
Christmas, they don't.

81
00:08:35,791 --> 00:08:39,832
<i>You know what? Yes, Patrick. Even
at Christmastime. What's your point?</i>

82
00:08:39,833 --> 00:08:43,915
Point is, it's super exciting,
Christmas. I used to get excited myself.

83
00:08:43,916 --> 00:08:47,082
- You fucking lie to me every day!
- I used to stay up all night.

84
00:08:47,083 --> 00:08:48,875
Oh, stop fucking crying.

85
00:08:49,625 --> 00:08:51,082
I said open up.

86
00:08:51,083 --> 00:08:54,333
Yo, not
right now. I'm busy.

87
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,874
Fuck "busy." It's the
police. Open the door.

88
00:09:01,041 --> 00:09:02,881
You better shut
the fuck up, all right?

89
00:09:03,541 --> 00:09:04,541
Just a sec.

90
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:11,541
Evening, officer.
There a problem here?

91
00:09:12,125 --> 00:09:13,708
- Where is she?
- Where's who?

92
00:09:14,291 --> 00:09:16,582
Quit bullshitting me, okay?
I heard a disturbance.

93
00:09:16,583 --> 00:09:19,499
Nah. Can't two
people argue no more?

94
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:22,708
I mean, I didn't call five-oh.
Bitch, you call five-oh?

95
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:25,874
Mm-mm. No.

96
00:09:25,875 --> 00:09:29,791
Nah, she didn't call,
so... what you doing here?

97
00:09:30,958 --> 00:09:32,166
Open the fucking door.

98
00:09:34,208 --> 00:09:38,124
Yeah, I just want to speak to my
daughter. It's, you know, it's Christmas.

99
00:09:38,125 --> 00:09:39,249
<i>Yeah. You keep saying.</i>

100
00:09:39,250 --> 00:09:42,374
- I'm trying here.
<i>- Showing up with a present doesn't count.</i>

101
00:09:42,375 --> 00:09:44,540
<i>I'm up to my neck in bills.
You can't keep up payments.</i>

102
00:09:44,541 --> 00:09:47,082
Yeah, but I have money.
You know I have money.

103
00:09:47,083 --> 00:09:48,666
We don't want your dirty money.

104
00:09:49,166 --> 00:09:52,332
<i>That dirty money stopped the bank
from foreclosing on the house.</i>

105
00:09:52,333 --> 00:09:53,832
<i>Didn't bother you then.</i>

106
00:09:53,833 --> 00:09:56,499
<i>My salary can't cover these
costs. What do you want me to do?</i>

107
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:58,290
Don't make me out
to be the bad guy.

108
00:09:58,291 --> 00:10:00,290
<i>The money was never the point.</i>

109
00:10:00,291 --> 00:10:02,957
<i>Eighteen months ago, the
man I loved disappeared,</i>

110
00:10:02,958 --> 00:10:06,625
<i>and a year ago, what was left
walked out. No explanation.</i>

111
00:10:07,291 --> 00:10:08,290
<i>All that's on you.</i>

112
00:10:08,291 --> 00:10:11,290
- That's not on me.
<i>- No, but you're putting it on Emmy.</i>

113
00:10:11,291 --> 00:10:14,999
Why don't you put her on the phone?
Ask her if she wants to speak to me?

114
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,874
<i>Because she's six years old. What
do you think she's gonna say?</i>

115
00:10:17,875 --> 00:10:19,707
- "Yeah."
- I said stop!

116
00:10:24,208 --> 00:10:25,208
The fuck?

117
00:10:25,916 --> 00:10:28,040
She fucking tripped me.

118
00:10:28,041 --> 00:10:29,207
Bullshit.

119
00:10:30,291 --> 00:10:31,291
Slipped.

120
00:10:34,083 --> 00:10:35,165
Wait. What are you doing?

121
00:10:35,166 --> 00:10:36,665
I told you to stay in the car.

122
00:10:36,666 --> 00:10:39,415
- You didn't see what was going on.
- It doesn't matter what's going on.

123
00:10:39,416 --> 00:10:40,582
I'm a homicide cop,

124
00:10:40,583 --> 00:10:43,374
which makes you, by association,
now a homicide cop too.

125
00:10:43,375 --> 00:10:44,457
Did someone die in there?

126
00:10:44,458 --> 00:10:45,624
- No, but...
- No?

127
00:10:45,625 --> 00:10:47,375
- If I hadn't...
- Fucking Christ!

128
00:10:47,958 --> 00:10:50,707
You better arrest that asshole.
He beat the shit out of me!

129
00:10:50,708 --> 00:10:52,957
- You see?
- Ain't the first time neither.

130
00:10:52,958 --> 00:10:54,540
You cause these
kind of problems.

131
00:10:54,541 --> 00:10:56,374
- Punk-ass bitch.
- No.

132
00:10:56,375 --> 00:10:59,124
- No, you call this in.
- Hey. Wait, wait! Where you going?

133
00:10:59,125 --> 00:11:01,708
- You can't leave me like this!
- Fuck you. Fuck you!

134
00:11:04,708 --> 00:11:07,290
The fuck is this guy?
We can't just be sitting here.

135
00:11:07,291 --> 00:11:10,249
You said we'd walk in, steal a
truckload of washing machines.

136
00:11:10,250 --> 00:11:12,374
- Yeah, that's what we did.
- No, that's not all we did.

137
00:11:12,375 --> 00:11:14,499
I might have killed
a fucking cop, man.

138
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:16,540
All we gotta do is
pay off Mia's debt.

139
00:11:16,541 --> 00:11:20,583
Anything else is on me. Whatever
happens, I'll take the rap.

140
00:11:21,916 --> 00:11:22,749
Yeah?

141
00:11:23,666 --> 00:11:25,250
Hey. He's here.

142
00:11:32,958 --> 00:11:33,958
All right.

143
00:11:35,333 --> 00:11:36,375
We're up.

144
00:11:42,416 --> 00:11:43,416
Hey.

145
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:45,583
We'll be right back.

146
00:11:46,208 --> 00:11:47,208
Okay?

147
00:12:02,833 --> 00:12:04,250
- Boss.
- Hm?

148
00:12:09,875 --> 00:12:12,083
- You made it.
- Yeah, we did.

149
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:14,500
Just barely.

150
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:16,500
Come on.

151
00:12:19,833 --> 00:12:20,833
This way.

152
00:12:31,208 --> 00:12:32,458
Open the door.

153
00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:11,374
Man, I gotta say.

154
00:13:11,375 --> 00:13:13,041
I didn't expect you to deliver.

155
00:13:14,625 --> 00:13:17,457
I definitely didn't have you
down for putting a cop in ICU,

156
00:13:17,458 --> 00:13:19,375
with a fucking washing machine.

157
00:13:20,583 --> 00:13:22,416
"I see you."

158
00:13:26,083 --> 00:13:27,083
You can leave us.

159
00:14:03,583 --> 00:14:05,000
- Huh.
- Sorry, boss.

160
00:14:17,416 --> 00:14:18,416
Light.

161
00:14:39,291 --> 00:14:40,833
- Keep a lookout.
- Yes, boss.

162
00:14:45,458 --> 00:14:47,041
What
the fuck is that?

163
00:14:47,791 --> 00:14:49,290
No, no, no, we gotta go!

164
00:14:50,250 --> 00:14:52,166
- We've gotta go!
- Turn it off!

165
00:15:03,583 --> 00:15:05,915
<i>Mia, get the
fuck out of there now!</i>

166
00:15:18,666 --> 00:15:20,750
I had it handled
back there, you know?

167
00:15:23,041 --> 00:15:25,625
So, are they putting, uh,
uniform with homicide now?

168
00:15:26,125 --> 00:15:27,540
I just go where I'm assigned.

169
00:15:27,541 --> 00:15:29,458
You must've pissed somebody off.

170
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:33,166
Must've shit the bed pretty bad
to get pinned on someone like me.

171
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:38,874
On the bright side, you didn't
have a partner, and now you do.

172
00:15:38,875 --> 00:15:41,583
No, we're not
partners. All right?

173
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:46,166
Did you get your
daughter's gift?

174
00:15:47,541 --> 00:15:48,541
Kinda.

175
00:15:51,875 --> 00:15:53,582
- How old is she?
- Six.

176
00:15:53,583 --> 00:15:56,165
She's, um... She's six.

177
00:15:56,166 --> 00:15:58,707
- And that's all they had?
- Yeah, that's all they had.

178
00:15:58,708 --> 00:16:01,707
Ah, doesn't matter. When I
was a kid, it's always...

179
00:16:01,708 --> 00:16:05,000
Yeah, you know what? I think
we shared just about enough.

180
00:16:09,041 --> 00:16:11,250
- What are you doing?
- What?

181
00:16:11,875 --> 00:16:14,666
Staring. Why are you staring? Why
are you doing that? Don't do that.

182
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,707
Don't look at you when
I'm talking to you?

183
00:16:18,708 --> 00:16:20,458
No, don't.

184
00:16:22,750 --> 00:16:24,915
<i>All
units, all units, 10-71.</i>

185
00:16:24,916 --> 00:16:27,041
<i>Code purple on Elmore and Fifth.</i>

186
00:17:03,875 --> 00:17:04,875
Yo!

187
00:17:06,583 --> 00:17:07,583
What you got for me?

188
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:09,500
This way.

189
00:17:10,916 --> 00:17:14,249
Okay, suspects fled up those stairs
through a restaurant full of diners,

190
00:17:14,250 --> 00:17:15,165
jumped in a car.

191
00:17:15,166 --> 00:17:17,040
Nobody got a look at the plates.

192
00:17:17,041 --> 00:17:20,707
We're still piecing together the
CCTV to track their journey. In here.

193
00:17:20,708 --> 00:17:22,166
Okay, thank you.

194
00:17:22,791 --> 00:17:26,583
Oh. All right.

195
00:19:02,583 --> 00:19:04,207
- Hey.
- Yeah, what?

196
00:19:04,208 --> 00:19:07,082
- Sorry about Cortez.
- What do you mean? Detective Cortez?

197
00:19:07,083 --> 00:19:08,415
- Yeah.
- Why? What happened?

198
00:19:08,416 --> 00:19:12,040
- He got hurt in a pursuit earlier.
- What do you mean hurt? What's wrong?

199
00:19:12,041 --> 00:19:14,832
Yeah, he's in surgery. Vince
and the guys are with him.

200
00:19:14,833 --> 00:19:17,666
- I figured they would've told you.
- Nobody told me shit.

201
00:19:18,333 --> 00:19:20,291
It's gonna be okay.
He'll pull through.

202
00:19:21,333 --> 00:19:22,333
All right?

203
00:19:30,666 --> 00:19:33,083
Shit.

204
00:19:58,458 --> 00:20:00,957
Sir, we got footage
of our suspects.

205
00:20:00,958 --> 00:20:03,707
All right, suspects.
Hey, where's that from?

206
00:20:03,708 --> 00:20:06,957
- Upstairs.
- All right. Got anything from down here?

207
00:20:06,958 --> 00:20:10,291
- No. Nothing down here yet.
- Nothing down here? All right.

208
00:20:12,416 --> 00:20:14,332
- Mm.
- Do you know him?

209
00:20:14,333 --> 00:20:17,290
I don't fucking know him. I don't
know everybody in this city.

210
00:20:17,291 --> 00:20:19,708
Ooh, there's a problem
with the suspect.

211
00:20:20,541 --> 00:20:23,750
- Well, she's armed.
- Yeah-huh. But what's she holding?

212
00:20:25,083 --> 00:20:26,374
- A pistol.
- Yeah, a pistol, right.

213
00:20:26,375 --> 00:20:27,957
You see any pistol shells here?

214
00:20:27,958 --> 00:20:29,832
- No.
- No. I don't either.

215
00:20:29,833 --> 00:20:32,249
What do you see? Look
around. What's that? These?

216
00:20:32,250 --> 00:20:33,457
Assault rounds.

217
00:20:33,458 --> 00:20:34,665
I see assault rounds too.

218
00:20:34,666 --> 00:20:38,582
High-velocity assault rounds, as a
matter of fact. So we're looking for...

219
00:20:38,583 --> 00:20:40,915
- An assault rifle.
- Rifle, right.

220
00:20:40,916 --> 00:20:44,040
Do you see an assault rifle? I
don't see a fucking assault rifle.

221
00:20:44,041 --> 00:20:46,749
A lot of dead people here,
never got a shot off.

222
00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:49,499
She supposed to have killed them
with a pea shooter? I don't think so.

223
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:52,249
Find me an assault rifle. We may
be looking for somebody else.

224
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:53,749
- Right.
- Yeah, right.

225
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:57,374
Uh, do we have any cameras down
here at all? Any... any footage?

226
00:20:57,375 --> 00:20:58,999
No, nothing down here.

227
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:02,332
All right. And we're
saying that they left this way?

228
00:21:02,333 --> 00:21:03,957
Yes. It's been established.

229
00:21:03,958 --> 00:21:06,291
So, who shot up
the staircase? Huh?

230
00:21:07,125 --> 00:21:10,415
'Cause someone did. Look, there's
a bunch of shells here too.

231
00:21:10,416 --> 00:21:11,625
- Huh?
- Hey.

232
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:15,541
- What you got there?
- It's just a mess.

233
00:21:16,125 --> 00:21:18,374
- You got a body to go with this mess?
- No.

234
00:21:18,375 --> 00:21:21,040
All we got's this blood
trail leading up the steps.

235
00:21:21,041 --> 00:21:22,624
It goes cold around the corner.

236
00:21:22,625 --> 00:21:23,916
Maybe they got in a car?

237
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:25,500
Jesus.

238
00:21:25,833 --> 00:21:28,207
Okay, our John Doe here
must've been working the door.

239
00:21:28,208 --> 00:21:31,707
So I want you to call every ICU.
Probably looking for a male.

240
00:21:31,708 --> 00:21:35,249
Probably Asian. Definitely full
of fucking holes, though, right?

241
00:21:35,250 --> 00:21:37,833
- Right.
- Maybe they have our assault rifle.

242
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:40,082
- Maybe.
- Maybe.

243
00:21:40,083 --> 00:21:42,665
Call me as soon as you have
any updates. All right?

244
00:21:42,666 --> 00:21:43,915
Yes, sir.

245
00:21:43,916 --> 00:21:45,583
I gotta take care of something.

246
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:16,500
Walker!

247
00:22:18,208 --> 00:22:19,624
We spending Christmas together?

248
00:22:19,625 --> 00:22:22,249
I don't know how you got
that DA off my back, but...

249
00:22:23,291 --> 00:22:28,165
...you gift-wrapped that motherfucker
in a nice pink bow.

250
00:22:28,166 --> 00:22:29,166
Good job.

251
00:22:31,083 --> 00:22:32,083
Where's Charlie?

252
00:22:34,541 --> 00:22:37,750
Charlie and I haven't spoken
since his mother passed, so...

253
00:22:38,583 --> 00:22:39,666
But you know that.

254
00:22:40,541 --> 00:22:42,374
I just came from a
crime scene. Right?

255
00:22:42,375 --> 00:22:45,332
Nine bodies. A coke
deal gone bad, real bad.

256
00:22:45,333 --> 00:22:48,499
And then I see this
on CCTV. Who's that?

257
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:50,583
- You recognize that kid?
- Charlie?

258
00:22:52,583 --> 00:22:53,832
You know where he is?

259
00:22:53,833 --> 00:22:54,790
I have no idea.

260
00:22:54,791 --> 00:22:58,332
My son is not a killer. There
is no way that he did this.

261
00:22:58,333 --> 00:23:01,165
Maybe he
did. Maybe he fucking didn't.

262
00:23:01,166 --> 00:23:02,999
Doesn't matter. He's
in the fucking mix.

263
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,207
- Fuck!
- Yeah, fuck.

264
00:23:05,208 --> 00:23:08,958
Way I see it, your son shit the bed so bad
you'll need a magic wand to clean this up.

265
00:23:09,666 --> 00:23:12,708
- How you gonna get me out of this?
- Are you fucking serious?

266
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:16,040
I can't help you with this. Your
son just started a gang war.

267
00:23:16,041 --> 00:23:17,790
They wanna shoot him
dead. End of the story.

268
00:23:17,791 --> 00:23:21,499
This whole thing here, your war on
drugs, "cleaning up the city" bullshit,

269
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:22,915
is over, man. You are done.

270
00:23:22,916 --> 00:23:26,416
Who the fuck do you think
you are? This is my town.

271
00:23:27,166 --> 00:23:29,166
And that's my son
we're talking about.

272
00:23:30,375 --> 00:23:31,750
I make one phone call,

273
00:23:33,375 --> 00:23:37,374
you and your friends
go down for life.

274
00:23:38,666 --> 00:23:41,958
Don't forget, I
know what you did.

275
00:23:42,541 --> 00:23:45,124
Mm. You wanna
talk about what I did?

276
00:23:45,125 --> 00:23:49,040
I blackmailed your DA, kept your ass
out of prison. That's what I did.

277
00:23:49,041 --> 00:23:52,332
All right? We are square,
Lawrence. We are good.

278
00:23:52,333 --> 00:23:54,540
When you came to me with this,

279
00:23:54,541 --> 00:23:57,000
you knew exactly what I
was gonna ask you to do.

280
00:23:57,583 --> 00:24:00,124
So don't pretend that you
don't got a price for this.

281
00:24:00,125 --> 00:24:02,540
I do... I do not want
your dirty money.

282
00:24:02,541 --> 00:24:05,832
So what do you... what do you... what
do you want from me? Just tell me.

283
00:24:05,833 --> 00:24:09,249
'Cause I'm not gonna let this thing
with my son destroy my campaign.

284
00:24:09,250 --> 00:24:12,582
I do that, and all of
this is for nothing.

285
00:24:12,583 --> 00:24:13,833
So tell me.

286
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,041
What do you want?

287
00:24:17,666 --> 00:24:19,041
What can I give you?

288
00:24:19,833 --> 00:24:22,582
I just... I just want you
out. That... that's all.

289
00:24:22,583 --> 00:24:25,041
I just... I want...
I'm done. I want...

290
00:24:32,833 --> 00:24:33,833
All right.

291
00:24:35,625 --> 00:24:38,083
Let's say I get your son.
I bring him back to you.

292
00:24:38,875 --> 00:24:41,250
Yeah? I go get him.
I bring him to you.

293
00:24:41,958 --> 00:24:44,832
You get him on a plane. I never
see your fucking face again.

294
00:24:44,833 --> 00:24:47,332
There will be no more
running around after that.

295
00:24:47,333 --> 00:24:49,375
That's it, we're done.

296
00:24:50,541 --> 00:24:51,541
We're square.

297
00:24:53,875 --> 00:24:55,125
That's what it will cost.

298
00:24:56,166 --> 00:24:57,166
That could work.

299
00:24:59,416 --> 00:25:00,332
Get him back.

300
00:25:00,333 --> 00:25:02,666
And I never see your
fucking face again?

301
00:25:03,250 --> 00:25:04,250
You heard me.

302
00:25:10,875 --> 00:25:12,166
I can work with that.

303
00:27:18,250 --> 00:27:20,541
She's
brought her own people.

304
00:27:23,791 --> 00:27:24,791
Welcome, Big Sister.

305
00:27:45,916 --> 00:27:46,958
Who killed my son?

306
00:27:50,166 --> 00:27:52,082
His father's an influential man.

307
00:27:52,083 --> 00:27:54,415
He may not be easy to find.

308
00:27:54,416 --> 00:27:56,500
If you can't find the
person who killed my son...

309
00:27:57,666 --> 00:27:59,500
I'll bury you with him.

310
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:35,999
I'm begging
you. My wife is in hospital.

311
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,915
I don't give a fuck
about your wife.

312
00:28:37,916 --> 00:28:40,875
Doesn't stop you from
owing me fucking money.

313
00:28:51,250 --> 00:28:54,999
My fucking nose!

314
00:29:14,458 --> 00:29:15,915
Hey! Hey!

315
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:19,916
No, no, no!

316
00:29:23,916 --> 00:29:25,165
Get the fuck up.

317
00:29:25,166 --> 00:29:28,165
Do you work for Tsui Fong,
huh? Does he understand me?

318
00:29:30,291 --> 00:29:33,125
Do you work for Tsui
Fong? Are you his doorman?

319
00:29:33,875 --> 00:29:35,332
- Yes.
- Yeah? Yeah!

320
00:29:35,333 --> 00:29:37,541
Yeah! All right, all
right. Good. Now...

321
00:29:38,958 --> 00:29:40,165
do you recognize this guy?

322
00:29:40,166 --> 00:29:42,457
He was at Tsui's last night.
Walked right past you.

323
00:29:42,458 --> 00:29:43,582
You saw him, right?

324
00:29:43,583 --> 00:29:44,540
He says no.

325
00:29:44,541 --> 00:29:46,249
You don't know this guy?

326
00:29:46,250 --> 00:29:49,166
Okay. Let me try and
remind you. See this?

327
00:29:52,625 --> 00:29:53,625
Huh?

328
00:29:54,625 --> 00:29:56,999
No, no. You don't get to
fall asleep. No, wake up.

329
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,374
Okay, come on. Back in the room, huh?

330
00:29:59,375 --> 00:30:01,415
You were winning. You
were winning, yeah?

331
00:30:01,416 --> 00:30:03,957
Does he remember yet?

332
00:30:03,958 --> 00:30:06,249
- He's seen him with Mr. Tsui.
- All right.

333
00:30:06,250 --> 00:30:10,332
Did he shoot, and did he
kill, Tsui Fong? Did he?

334
00:30:10,333 --> 00:30:11,833
Listen to this man.

335
00:30:14,583 --> 00:30:16,207
But... No.

336
00:30:18,250 --> 00:30:19,375
What's he saying?

337
00:30:21,041 --> 00:30:23,041
He said three demons came.

338
00:30:23,833 --> 00:30:24,833
Demons?

339
00:30:26,833 --> 00:30:27,749
Yeah?

340
00:30:27,750 --> 00:30:29,916
Right. All right.

341
00:30:30,541 --> 00:30:31,999
And I'm a leprechaun,

342
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:35,124
and I come riding in on a little
unicorn all the way down here.

343
00:30:35,125 --> 00:30:38,124
Huh? Do you understand this? Huh?

344
00:30:38,125 --> 00:30:40,374
You've got to give me
something better than that.

345
00:30:40,375 --> 00:30:43,707
Tell him he's got to do better.
Give me something better.

346
00:30:46,875 --> 00:30:49,791
What is he saying? I don't
understand what you're saying.

347
00:30:51,041 --> 00:30:52,915
Demons in hockey masks.

348
00:30:52,916 --> 00:30:55,457
Demons with hockey masks.

349
00:30:55,458 --> 00:30:58,958
That's... That what I... That's
what I have to work with. That's...

350
00:30:59,625 --> 00:31:01,958
They shot him.
They shot Mr. Tsui.

351
00:31:04,250 --> 00:31:05,499
That's all he knows.

352
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:14,541
Mr. Walker, please.
He's gonna die.

353
00:31:21,958 --> 00:31:25,332
You should've called me the moment
this guy walked inside your office.

354
00:31:25,333 --> 00:31:28,290
That's what you're supposed to
do. That's what you get paid for.

355
00:31:28,291 --> 00:31:30,749
Hey. Before you pump
people full of drugs.

356
00:31:30,750 --> 00:31:32,624
I can't work with this.
Look at the state of...

357
00:31:32,625 --> 00:31:34,041
I can't do anything with this.

358
00:31:35,833 --> 00:31:38,040
Demons with fucking
hockey masks.

359
00:31:38,041 --> 00:31:40,333
Next time, I won't make
it look so convenient.

360
00:31:48,666 --> 00:31:50,499
You fucking rat.

361
00:31:50,500 --> 00:31:51,875
You betrayed me.

362
00:31:52,458 --> 00:31:53,750
You betrayed me!

363
00:32:28,166 --> 00:32:29,416
Hey, Walker.

364
00:32:33,416 --> 00:32:34,416
Good to see you.

365
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:36,415
How's he doing?

366
00:32:36,416 --> 00:32:37,499
Not great.

367
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:38,999
Used to be, when
one of us got hurt,

368
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,332
the others would drop
everything to be by his side.

369
00:32:41,333 --> 00:32:43,249
- I just heard.
- They got a waiting room.

370
00:32:43,250 --> 00:32:46,374
I'm sorry. It looks like you
got chewed up pretty bad, Jake.

371
00:32:46,375 --> 00:32:48,624
It's kinda hard to dodge
a fucking washing machine.

372
00:32:48,625 --> 00:32:51,625
Hey, come on. We're all
hurting. No one's to blame. Hey.

373
00:32:52,708 --> 00:32:55,541
We missed you. Everything
good at home? Family okay?

374
00:32:56,833 --> 00:32:58,208
Yeah, everyone's good.

375
00:32:59,458 --> 00:33:02,374
Dispatch announced Charlie
Beaumont's public enemy number one.

376
00:33:02,375 --> 00:33:04,749
- You know they ID'd him in Chinatown?
- Mm.

377
00:33:04,750 --> 00:33:07,916
They also got him stealing that
fucking truck we were chasing.

378
00:33:09,333 --> 00:33:11,790
- All right.
- Hope that doesn't put you in a box.

379
00:33:11,791 --> 00:33:12,790
I'm sorry?

380
00:33:12,791 --> 00:33:15,332
Uh, you just lost
me there, Vince.

381
00:33:15,333 --> 00:33:16,374
Oh, I doubt that.

382
00:33:16,375 --> 00:33:19,124
No, really. I... What's
that supposed to mean?

383
00:33:19,125 --> 00:33:21,290
We've all done
shit for Lawrence,

384
00:33:21,291 --> 00:33:23,957
but that don't give his
kid a free fucking pass

385
00:33:23,958 --> 00:33:25,375
to hurt one of our own.

386
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:30,582
So what you gonna do?
You gonna shoot him?

387
00:33:30,583 --> 00:33:31,583
Hm?

388
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,000
Mm.

389
00:33:38,708 --> 00:33:41,082
All right, it's been
cool. Great catching up.

390
00:33:41,083 --> 00:33:43,416
If you don't mind, I'm
gonna see our friend.

391
00:33:54,333 --> 00:33:56,499
Angie. Hey.

392
00:33:56,500 --> 00:33:57,541
Walker.

393
00:33:59,083 --> 00:34:00,708
It's so good to see you.

394
00:34:09,833 --> 00:34:11,791
How's he doing?

395
00:34:12,833 --> 00:34:13,833
He's stable.

396
00:34:14,375 --> 00:34:15,541
They...

397
00:34:16,333 --> 00:34:17,375
They don't know if...

398
00:34:18,250 --> 00:34:20,790
<i>when</i> he does wake,

399
00:34:20,791 --> 00:34:22,374
they don't know whether he'll...

400
00:34:22,375 --> 00:34:23,375
He will.

401
00:34:24,875 --> 00:34:25,875
He will.

402
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:27,958
No, don't even think about it.

403
00:34:30,750 --> 00:34:31,750
Hm.

404
00:34:32,250 --> 00:34:33,833
He's always looked up to you.

405
00:34:36,875 --> 00:34:39,040
He even spoke about
leaving narcotics.

406
00:34:41,416 --> 00:34:42,415
Joining your unit.

407
00:34:44,583 --> 00:34:46,625
Hm.

408
00:34:49,291 --> 00:34:50,832
He's been unhappy for a while.

409
00:34:55,125 --> 00:34:56,875
I thought
it was me at first.

410
00:34:58,500 --> 00:35:03,374
Last night, before he went into surgery,
he was in and out of consciousness.

411
00:35:03,375 --> 00:35:06,165
I couldn't tell if
he was delirious,

412
00:35:06,166 --> 00:35:09,582
but he kept talking about the
five of you getting in a mess.

413
00:35:25,666 --> 00:35:27,916
<i>He said some
things.</i>

414
00:35:28,875 --> 00:35:29,875
<i>About you.</i>

415
00:35:30,833 --> 00:35:32,500
<i>About Vincent and the guys.</i>

416
00:35:33,958 --> 00:35:35,791
<i>He sounded scared, Walker.</i>

417
00:35:37,208 --> 00:35:40,457
<i>He said something about how
you shouldn't have been there,</i>

418
00:35:40,458 --> 00:35:44,125
<i>that... that</i> he <i>shouldn't
have been there.</i>

419
00:35:47,500 --> 00:35:49,541
He said... he said
you took care of it.

420
00:35:57,291 --> 00:35:58,291
Hm.

421
00:36:02,708 --> 00:36:04,583
Yeah, I know what
he's talking about.

422
00:36:06,958 --> 00:36:09,166
And it has absolutely
nothing to do with him.

423
00:36:11,416 --> 00:36:12,416
That's on me.

424
00:36:13,333 --> 00:36:14,500
And that's on Vincent.

425
00:36:15,958 --> 00:36:17,583
But it has nothing
to do with him.

426
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:26,083
Excuse me, Mrs. Cortez. May I
speak to you in private, please?

427
00:36:28,125 --> 00:36:29,125
Excuse me.

428
00:36:29,875 --> 00:36:31,208
This way, please.

429
00:36:32,250 --> 00:36:33,291
What is it?

430
00:36:34,416 --> 00:36:37,832
Your husband is
stable, his vitals are good,

431
00:36:37,833 --> 00:36:40,125
but he has sustained
significant impact damage...

432
00:37:26,208 --> 00:37:28,333
Guy's carrying
fucking wiretaps.

433
00:37:29,083 --> 00:37:31,249
What the fuck is an
undercover cop doing here?

434
00:37:31,250 --> 00:37:33,375
Shit. We need to
get him to hospital.

435
00:37:35,041 --> 00:37:36,707
I don't think
he's gonna make it.

436
00:37:36,708 --> 00:37:39,207
He's one of us,
Vince. I can't have this on me.

437
00:37:39,208 --> 00:37:41,749
Walker, I'm pretty sure
that's one of the good guys,

438
00:37:41,750 --> 00:37:45,332
and if he did make it, he'd
have a hell of a story to tell.

439
00:37:45,333 --> 00:37:46,999
And I ain't gonna
have that on me.

440
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,040
We're taking
him. End of discussion.

441
00:38:10,833 --> 00:38:12,083
Fuck.

442
00:38:17,166 --> 00:38:18,166
Mia.

443
00:38:26,958 --> 00:38:29,207
You been on TV all
day. What the fuck?

444
00:38:29,208 --> 00:38:30,874
You want to tell
me what happened?

445
00:38:30,875 --> 00:38:33,874
We had no choice! Tsui was gonna kill
us if we didn't do what he asked.

446
00:38:33,875 --> 00:38:36,207
- Just like that?
- Yes! You know how he is!

447
00:38:36,208 --> 00:38:38,291
"Was." He's fucking dead now.

448
00:38:38,916 --> 00:38:40,957
You know, I could
get you papers,

449
00:38:40,958 --> 00:38:43,458
but it'd be a whole lot
easier if you was on your own.

450
00:38:44,041 --> 00:38:44,999
Listen.

451
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,375
Your boy Charlie,

452
00:38:47,458 --> 00:38:50,332
he has a very rich father
that can take care of him.

453
00:38:50,333 --> 00:38:51,333
What you got?

454
00:38:51,833 --> 00:38:53,874
This right here. Me. That's it.

455
00:38:53,875 --> 00:38:58,000
Yeah, and that means the world,
<i>tío</i>, but I... So does he.

456
00:39:04,875 --> 00:39:05,958
Okay.

457
00:39:15,083 --> 00:39:17,750
I call you. You don't call me.

458
00:39:19,166 --> 00:39:20,208
Remember that.

459
00:39:27,125 --> 00:39:29,540
I'll have those passports
ready by this evening.

460
00:39:29,541 --> 00:39:31,457
Okay.

461
00:39:31,458 --> 00:39:32,916
Kid.

462
00:39:34,166 --> 00:39:35,333
Be safe.

463
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,707
- Okay.
- Go.

464
00:39:38,708 --> 00:39:39,875
Go, come on.

465
00:39:51,500 --> 00:39:54,166
Get out. Get
out of the fucking car!

466
00:39:54,833 --> 00:39:56,957
- Stop resisting!
- Get his fucking arm.

467
00:39:56,958 --> 00:39:57,958
- Fuck!
- I'm trying.

468
00:39:59,583 --> 00:40:01,082
Grab his fucking legs.

469
00:40:01,083 --> 00:40:03,165
What do you
mean I can't speak to him?

470
00:40:13,916 --> 00:40:14,916
Jesus.

471
00:40:15,875 --> 00:40:16,874
Yeah.

472
00:40:16,875 --> 00:40:19,207
- Hey, man, that's the captain's.
- Yeah, she won't mind.

473
00:40:19,208 --> 00:40:21,874
- What the hell happened to you?
- You got my assault rifle?

474
00:40:21,875 --> 00:40:23,833
No, but I found this.

475
00:40:24,791 --> 00:40:25,916
What's this?

476
00:40:26,583 --> 00:40:27,583
It's a mask.

477
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,208
Maybe a hockey mask?

478
00:40:30,666 --> 00:40:33,166
- It's got blood on it.
- Yeah.

479
00:40:34,125 --> 00:40:36,041
- You run this?
- Yes, I did.

480
00:40:39,083 --> 00:40:41,832
Yeah, that's good.
Look at you, killer.

481
00:40:41,833 --> 00:40:45,082
Yeah. I found that doorman.

482
00:40:45,083 --> 00:40:46,124
You found him?

483
00:40:46,125 --> 00:40:47,124
Mm-hmm.

484
00:40:47,125 --> 00:40:49,707
You had me running around all
the ICUs all day looking for him.

485
00:40:49,708 --> 00:40:51,541
I didn't know I
was gonna find him.

486
00:40:52,708 --> 00:40:53,540
What'd he say?

487
00:40:53,541 --> 00:40:57,332
He was talking about demons and
dragons, and shooting up the place.

488
00:40:57,333 --> 00:40:58,374
Demons?

489
00:40:59,916 --> 00:41:01,415
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

490
00:41:01,416 --> 00:41:03,250
So you didn't miss
much. Who's this?

491
00:41:04,291 --> 00:41:06,832
That's Clarice Fong. Mother
to our dead Triad boss.

492
00:41:06,833 --> 00:41:09,999
She and a bunch of new faces are
in town for the funeral party.

493
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,000
Walker.

494
00:41:12,583 --> 00:41:13,583
Shit.

495
00:41:16,791 --> 00:41:18,041
How's your new partner?

496
00:41:18,791 --> 00:41:20,499
Uh, good. Yeah, good.

497
00:41:20,500 --> 00:41:22,832
Good? Richardson could use her.

498
00:41:22,833 --> 00:41:24,333
What's that supposed to mean?

499
00:41:25,625 --> 00:41:28,540
You knew it was Charlie
Beaumont on that security video,

500
00:41:28,541 --> 00:41:30,250
and you kept it to yourself.

501
00:41:31,666 --> 00:41:34,375
Cortez is fighting for his life.

502
00:41:34,958 --> 00:41:37,249
I thought you'd have more class.

503
00:41:37,250 --> 00:41:38,583
Um... Mm.

504
00:41:39,666 --> 00:41:40,666
We done?

505
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,000
Yeah, we're done.

506
00:41:43,833 --> 00:41:46,915
Ellie, Richardson will
be the lead on this case.

507
00:41:46,916 --> 00:41:49,208
- Report to him immediately.
- Yes, ma'am.

508
00:41:52,791 --> 00:41:54,708
Hey. Hey, you.

509
00:41:55,458 --> 00:41:57,750
Hey, you, come here. Ellie.

510
00:41:58,458 --> 00:42:00,540
- What do you want?
- Tell me what they got on the girl.

511
00:42:00,541 --> 00:42:02,582
- You lied to me.
- I know. Sorry about that.

512
00:42:02,583 --> 00:42:05,582
- Could've trusted me.
- I know. Sorry about that too. All right?

513
00:42:05,583 --> 00:42:08,082
- I need information.
- You don't. You're off the case.

514
00:42:08,083 --> 00:42:09,999
Hey, Richardson's not
gonna solve no case.

515
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,874
That's not what's gonna happen.
He'll find two kids dead in a ditch.

516
00:42:12,875 --> 00:42:15,082
All right? That's gonna be on us.

517
00:42:15,083 --> 00:42:16,583
And you know they didn't do it.

518
00:42:20,750 --> 00:42:23,708
She works at a scrapyard
owned by a Raul Vasquez.

519
00:42:24,750 --> 00:42:26,833
- This does not come back to me.
- It won't.

520
00:42:28,583 --> 00:42:30,040

up on the curb, please?

531
00:43:20,958 --> 00:43:23,208

- Fuck that.

532
00:43:24,250 --> 00:43:27,124
I got people smarter than you
telling me I can't be protected.

533
00:43:27,125 --> 00:43:29,375

These people will kill you. We
need to get you out of the city.

558
00:45:21,291 --> 00:45:24,375
Raul. I want to talk to you.

559
00:45:24,958 --> 00:45:27,708
- Who the fuck?
- What's up?

560
00:45:28,291 --> 00:45:29,571
- Don't do that.
- Whoa.

561
00:45:30,791 --> 00:45:33,250
Are you fucking
serious? Is that how you run?

562
00:45:33,958 --> 00:45:36,124
What the fuck is that about?
What have you got there?

563
00:45:36,125 --> 00:45:39,165
- What the fuck are you holding?
- I wasn't running. I really...

564
00:45:39,166 --> 00:45:42,749
What the fuck are these, man?
All right. Where are they?

565
00:45:42,750 --> 00:45:43,832
They didn't tell me.

566
00:45:43,833 --> 00:45:45,874
- They didn't tell you? Don't lie to me.
- No, sir.

567
00:45:45,875 --> 00:45:48,374
- I'm not lying, man.
- Do I look like I was born yesterday?

568
00:45:48,375 --> 00:45:50,540
- No, sir. No.
- How'd she get a passport from you?

569
00:45:50,541 --> 00:45:51,957
- You fucking this kid?
- What?

570
00:45:51,958 --> 00:45:54,207
- Fucking a girl half your age?
- Come on. She's a kid.

571
00:45:54,208 --> 00:45:55,790
- Are you fucking a kid?
- Fuck you, man!

572
00:45:55,791 --> 00:45:57,915
I told you she's like
my kid. I raised her.

573
00:45:57,916 --> 00:45:59,749
So you do know this
kid. You're lying to me.

574
00:45:59,750 --> 00:46:02,540
I'm not lying. I told
you she's like my kid.

575
00:46:02,541 --> 00:46:04,665
So do you realize your kid
is in a lot of trouble?

576
00:46:04,666 --> 00:46:07,374
She didn't do what they say she
did. She was just at the wrong...

577
00:46:07,375 --> 00:46:10,541
Yeah, I know the story. Wrong
place, wrong fucking time.

578
00:46:15,291 --> 00:46:17,624
I'm going to be honest
with you, all right?

579
00:46:17,625 --> 00:46:18,625
Okay.

580
00:46:19,166 --> 00:46:22,291
She will not get out of
this fucking city alive.

581
00:46:25,041 --> 00:46:26,250
Not without my help.

582
00:46:27,708 --> 00:46:28,708
Mm?

583
00:46:33,333 --> 00:46:34,915
Who the hell are you?

584
00:46:34,916 --> 00:46:36,125
I'm a fucking cop!

585
00:46:36,750 --> 00:46:39,082
- Okay. I understood that.
- You understand?

586
00:46:39,083 --> 00:46:39,999
- Yes.
- All right.

587
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:41,083
I understand.

588
00:46:41,625 --> 00:46:45,749
I happen to have a vested interest in
this guy, Charlie. You know Charlie?

589
00:46:45,750 --> 00:46:49,165
They didn't tell me where they went.
I swear. She said she'd call me.

590
00:46:49,166 --> 00:46:50,750
- That's all I...
- She would call you?

591
00:46:51,625 --> 00:46:52,457
That's dishonest.

592
00:46:52,458 --> 00:46:55,166
- Come on, bro. I...
- You're dishonest. Quiet.

593
00:46:56,500 --> 00:46:58,790
Unlock the phone. Unlock
the fucking phone.

594
00:46:58,791 --> 00:46:59,791
Unlock it.

595
00:47:02,125 --> 00:47:03,125
Here, man.

596
00:47:06,125 --> 00:47:08,624
You need the girl to stay
alive, right? Mia, right?

597
00:47:08,625 --> 00:47:10,790
- Please, yeah. Mia's her name.
- Hm? All right.

598
00:47:10,791 --> 00:47:12,540
- I'm gonna help you.
- I appreciate that.

599
00:47:12,541 --> 00:47:16,749
This is how it works. When I
leave here, you do not know me.

600
00:47:16,750 --> 00:47:18,624
You have not seen
me. We did not talk.

601
00:47:18,625 --> 00:47:22,583
I have not seen you. I don't know you.
We didn't talk. None of that shit.

602
00:47:23,125 --> 00:47:24,624
- All right.
- Thank you.

603
00:47:24,625 --> 00:47:26,290
- Are we cool?
- We're good, man.

604
00:47:26,291 --> 00:47:27,832
All right. We're cool.

605
00:47:27,833 --> 00:47:29,957
Hands up! Turn around, face the wall!

606
00:47:29,958 --> 00:47:32,165
- Put your hands up! He's got a gun!
- I got it.

607
00:47:32,166 --> 00:47:33,915
No! I don't have a gun!

608
00:47:33,916 --> 00:47:36,957
- Where's the gun, asshole?
- I don't have a fucking gun!

609
00:47:36,958 --> 00:47:39,915
Where's the fucking
gun? Hold him the fuck down.

610
00:47:45,833 --> 00:47:48,114
Where were you
the night my son was killed?

611
00:47:49,666 --> 00:47:53,082
He dismissed me because
I disagreed with him.

612
00:47:53,083 --> 00:47:55,749
I warned him not to do a
deal with Beaumont's son.

613
00:47:55,750 --> 00:47:58,291
He refused to listen.
I had to obey.

614
00:47:59,541 --> 00:48:00,541
Who's the girl?

615
00:48:01,166 --> 00:48:03,499
{\an8}Charlie
Beaumont's girlfriend.

616
00:48:03,500 --> 00:48:06,582
She stole a car
from Master Tsui.

617
00:48:06,583 --> 00:48:09,500
He caught her and
kept her in his debt.

618
00:48:10,708 --> 00:48:13,068
Shouldn't be hard to flush her out...

619
00:48:15,208 --> 00:48:16,165
Boss.

620
00:48:16,166 --> 00:48:18,625
- What is it?
- There's a guy. He wants to see you.

621
00:48:23,916 --> 00:48:25,625
What the
fuck you want, man?

622
00:48:28,625 --> 00:48:29,625
I...

623
00:48:30,666 --> 00:48:34,791
I just wanted you to know that
I wasn't in that room with them.

624
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:38,083
Yeah, I... I know
who your son is.

625
00:48:39,875 --> 00:48:44,499
I swear, I was just a guy sitting in
a car on the other side of the street.

626
00:48:44,500 --> 00:48:46,874
You know? I had nothing
to do with what went down.

627
00:48:46,875 --> 00:48:50,624
These guys showed up, and in two
minutes, everything just got fucked up.

628
00:48:50,625 --> 00:48:52,707
Oh no. Wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait.

629

Wait, wait, wait.

630
00:48:53,750 --> 00:48:54,832
Wait.

Please, please. Okay.

632
00:48:57,708 --> 00:49:00,166

633
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:04,540
The girl... The girl... I know
where the girl's gonna be at.

634
00:49:04,541 --> 00:49:06,750

can take you to her.

Jesus. Five bucks. I don't
want it. I don't need it.

650
00:52:19,541 --> 00:52:20,791
- Oh shit.
- Uh-uh-uh.

651
00:52:21,500 --> 00:52:22,500
Where's Charlie?

652
00:52:23,375 --> 00:52:25,707
Look, I'm a cop, but I'm not
here to arrest you, all right?

653
00:52:25,708 --> 00:52:28,207
I'm not trying to put you
away. I work for his father.

654
00:52:28,208 --> 00:52:31,332
But if you are concerned at all
for his well-being, which I doubt,

655
00:52:31,333 --> 00:52:33,499
then you will just tell
me where the fuck he is.

656
00:52:33,500 --> 00:52:34,832
I'm not telling you shit.

657
00:52:34,833 --> 00:52:37,583
Ah, that's real stupid, all right?
That's the wrong fucking answer!

658
00:52:38,666 --> 00:52:41,415
Now whatever hustle this is,
whatever you and your uncle,

659
00:52:41,416 --> 00:52:45,082
whatever scheme you got going
on, you are getting paid, right?

660
00:52:45,083 --> 00:52:47,999
I will just pay you double, and
then you can have this back,

661
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:49,540
and you get to
fucking walk away.

662
00:52:49,541 --> 00:52:52,707
- You think I'm with Charlie for the money?
- I don't give a fuck why!

663
00:52:52,708 --> 00:52:56,333
Fuck you! If you're not here to arrest
me, then get the fuck away from me!

664
00:52:57,958 --> 00:52:58,958
Oh shit.

665
00:53:04,375 --> 00:53:05,749
- That's him.
- That's who?

666
00:53:05,750 --> 00:53:07,458
That's the guy that killed Tsui.

667
00:53:14,083 --> 00:53:15,958
- You sure?
- Yeah, I'm fucking sure.

668
00:53:16,541 --> 00:53:18,665
He was wearing a hockey
mask until I shot it off.

669
00:53:18,666 --> 00:53:20,249
Nah, you know what?
Fuck this. I'm out.

670
00:53:20,250 --> 00:53:22,375
You stay exactly where
you are. You do not move.

671
00:53:24,500 --> 00:53:25,500
Yo.

672
00:53:26,916 --> 00:53:28,249
What brings you boys here?

673
00:53:28,250 --> 00:53:30,582
We didn't want to miss
out on all the fun.

674
00:53:30,583 --> 00:53:32,165
I didn't know you played hockey.

675
00:53:34,625 --> 00:53:38,332
We just want to talk to the girl.
Come on, Walker. She's a suspect.

676
00:53:38,333 --> 00:53:39,457
You with us?

677
00:53:39,458 --> 00:53:42,291
I'm not. That all right?
There gonna be a problem?

678
00:53:43,166 --> 00:53:44,708
I'll give you two guesses.

679
00:53:53,916 --> 00:53:55,916
You go
that way. You, with me.

680
00:54:06,208 --> 00:54:10,415
Walker, I've asked
nice. Now, I'm taking her.

681
00:54:10,416 --> 00:54:11,416
I don't think so.

682
00:54:14,916 --> 00:54:17,958
You can step aside and
let us take the girl in,

683
00:54:19,750 --> 00:54:21,625
or we'll just go through you.

684
00:54:22,250 --> 00:54:23,250
Up to you.

685
00:54:31,083 --> 00:54:32,666
All right, that's far enough.

686
00:54:36,541 --> 00:54:39,041
Shit.

687
00:55:05,041 --> 00:55:06,916
Hey! Hey!

688
00:55:08,333 --> 00:55:10,375
Hey! Hey!

689
00:56:16,250 --> 00:56:17,458
Move it, bitch.

690
00:56:19,625 --> 00:56:21,166
Get the fuck off me, man!

691
00:56:37,416 --> 00:56:39,333
No!

692
00:57:28,541 --> 00:57:30,125
Mia!

693
00:57:30,958 --> 00:57:32,375
Mia?

694
00:57:48,916 --> 00:57:52,332
Hey. It's okay. I got you. Let's
get out of here. Okay. Fuck!

695
00:57:52,333 --> 00:57:54,040
I'm here to get you.
Your father sent me.

696
00:57:54,041 --> 00:57:57,125
- Man, fuck you!
- Charlie!

697
00:57:57,791 --> 00:57:59,041
No, no!

698
00:58:00,166 --> 00:58:02,374
It ain't up for discussion.

699
00:58:26,041 --> 00:58:28,333
Get up!

700
00:58:30,250 --> 00:58:31,624
- <i>Tío!</i>
- Let her go!

701
00:58:31,625 --> 00:58:34,249
Drop the gun, Raul.

702
00:59:17,625 --> 00:59:19,166
Get up.
Come on, let's go.

703
00:59:19,875 --> 00:59:21,040
Hands in the air.

704
00:59:21,041 --> 00:59:24,165
- Put the knife down! Now!
- Drop your weapon!

705
00:59:24,166 --> 00:59:25,790
- Drop your weapon!
- I'm a cop!

706
00:59:25,791 --> 00:59:28,415
I'm telling you, drop
your gun, man! Drop it!

707
00:59:28,416 --> 00:59:30,374
I don't give a fuck who you are!

708
00:59:30,375 --> 00:59:32,540
Charlie! Charlie, help me!

709
00:59:32,541 --> 00:59:35,124
Look at my badge, you dumb
motherfucker! I'm a cop.

710
00:59:37,166 --> 00:59:38,166
Johnny!

711
00:59:44,541 --> 00:59:47,291
No, no, Mia!
Mia, no! Wait! Mia!

712
01:00:10,458 --> 01:00:13,708
No, wait! No! <i>Tío</i>. What?
Come on. We gotta go!

713
01:00:14,666 --> 01:00:16,375
<i>Tío,</i>
come on, please!

714
01:00:23,291 --> 01:00:24,291
No! No!

715
01:00:25,541 --> 01:00:27,124
No, please, please!

716
01:00:27,125 --> 01:00:29,582
<i>Tío!</i> No! No, come on, no!

717
01:00:29,583 --> 01:00:32,749
No! No, no, no! No, no! Charlie!

718
01:00:56,541 --> 01:00:57,665
Come on!

719
01:01:09,333 --> 01:01:10,749
Need backup!

720
01:01:18,333 --> 01:01:20,625
Come on, come on!

721
01:01:21,208 --> 01:01:22,333
Get in. Come on.

722
01:01:27,875 --> 01:01:28,875
Charlie.

723
01:01:33,041 --> 01:01:34,582
Get the fuck in.

724
01:01:34,583 --> 01:01:35,874
Let's go!

725
01:01:55,500 --> 01:01:56,750
Get down!

726
01:02:10,958 --> 01:02:14,707
- Help me tie them up!
- Down! Get down now!

727
01:02:17,750 --> 01:02:18,750
No, no!

728
01:02:35,125 --> 01:02:36,125
Hayes?

729
01:02:54,625 --> 01:02:56,291
Man, what the fuck do we do now?

730
01:03:03,291 --> 01:03:05,541
Please stand
behind the yellow line.

731
01:03:21,666 --> 01:03:22,499
Walker, what the...

732
01:03:22,500 --> 01:03:24,665
Hey, Ellie, you near
any cops right now?

733
01:03:24,666 --> 01:03:27,208
<i>Only the entire fucking
force. What have you done?</i>

734
01:03:27,750 --> 01:03:29,707
All right. All
right, listen to me.

735
01:03:29,708 --> 01:03:32,040
Vincent, Hayes, Jake, they're
all involved, all right?

736
01:03:32,041 --> 01:03:34,374
<i>They weren't in pursuit
of the fucking truck,</i>

737
01:03:34,375 --> 01:03:36,207
<i>they were after
the coke inside it.</i>

738
01:03:36,208 --> 01:03:38,375
<i>They're the ones
that shot up Tsui's.</i>

739
01:03:38,875 --> 01:03:41,083
<i>Demons in fucking hockey masks.</i>

740
01:03:42,333 --> 01:03:44,291
<i>- Ellie?</i>
- Hayes is dead.

741
01:03:46,541 --> 01:03:47,541
All right.

742
01:03:48,166 --> 01:03:50,374
All right, I need you
to go to the hospital.

743
01:03:50,375 --> 01:03:51,624
Sorry, what?

744
01:03:51,625 --> 01:03:53,624
<i>I need you to get to
the hospital, all right?</i>

745
01:03:53,625 --> 01:03:57,707
Cortez, I don't think he was involved,
and if he is, then he'll say something.

746
01:03:57,708 --> 01:03:58,915
How can you be so sure?

747
01:03:58,916 --> 01:04:00,250
Because he's my friend.

748
01:04:03,625 --> 01:04:04,707
I don't think I can do this.

749
01:04:04,708 --> 01:04:07,707
Ellie, do you remember when you
asked me why didn't I trust you?

750
01:04:07,708 --> 01:04:11,458
This is me, right now, I am trusting
you. Please, can you just do this for me?

751
01:04:15,291 --> 01:04:16,291
<i>Ellie?</i>

752
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:19,333
Where are you taking them?

753
01:04:19,875 --> 01:04:22,374
I swear to God, wherever I get
to, I'll call you straightaway.

754
01:04:22,375 --> 01:04:23,707
Just please get to the hospital.

755
01:04:23,708 --> 01:04:25,165
<i>- Do this for me, please.</i>
- Okay.

756
01:04:25,166 --> 01:04:26,166
Thank you.

757
01:04:49,291 --> 01:04:50,665
I'll have to call you back.

758
01:04:50,666 --> 01:04:53,375
<i>Don't you fucking hang
up on me, you little prick.</i>

759
01:04:54,083 --> 01:04:58,749
Listen, about an hour ago, I
ran into our friend at a club,

760
01:04:58,750 --> 01:05:00,415
but I didn't get to talk to her

761
01:05:00,416 --> 01:05:03,124
because a bunch of your <i>Dynasty
Warrior</i> buddies showed up.

762
01:05:03,125 --> 01:05:05,499
<i>- No, they weren't my buddies.</i>
- They sure looked it.

763
01:05:05,500 --> 01:05:08,124
<i>Vincent, I don't have to
tell you how important it is</i>

764
01:05:08,125 --> 01:05:09,999
<i>that you find those
kids before they do.</i>

765
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:11,000
No shit.

766
01:05:11,666 --> 01:05:12,874
<i>Where are they now?</i>

767
01:05:12,875 --> 01:05:14,707
That's the thing. I got no idea.

768
01:05:14,708 --> 01:05:19,124
All I know is I got that stuff you
wanted. So, where should we meet?

769
01:05:19,125 --> 01:05:23,083
My buyer doesn't want the coke anymore.
Too much heat. All thanks to you.

770
01:05:23,666 --> 01:05:27,582
Ching, I swear to God, I will put
a hole through your fucking chest.

771
01:05:27,583 --> 01:05:30,540
<i>Tell me, how many times are
you going to fuck up, Vincent?</i>

772
01:05:30,541 --> 01:05:33,249
I tip you off about the
girl, and you let her go.

773
01:05:33,250 --> 01:05:34,790
I tell you about the shipments.

774
01:05:34,791 --> 01:05:37,708
All you had to do was
intercept the fucking truck.

775
01:05:38,208 --> 01:05:39,958
So, what the fuck did...

776
01:05:40,500 --> 01:05:42,041
Oh, I'm sorry.

777
01:05:42,625 --> 01:05:43,625
Sorry.

778
01:05:45,166 --> 01:05:47,916
<i>Where is the gratitude?
I got you a promotion.</i>

779
01:05:48,750 --> 01:05:50,833
That was never part of our deal.

780
01:05:51,583 --> 01:05:55,290
Ching, we close this tonight,

781
01:05:55,291 --> 01:05:58,832
or I have my boys pimping
dime bags in Chinatown.

782
01:05:58,833 --> 01:06:00,915
Might make Mom suspicious,
don't you think?

783
01:06:02,916 --> 01:06:05,332
Well done.
You really played me.

784
01:06:05,333 --> 01:06:07,290
But don't forget,
this is my world,

785
01:06:07,291 --> 01:06:10,207
and once I get what I'm
due, I'll fuck you up.

786
01:06:10,208 --> 01:06:11,625
Listen to me.

787
01:06:12,125 --> 01:06:13,540
You got one hour.

788
01:06:13,541 --> 01:06:17,041
We all have loose ends,
Vincent.

789
01:06:22,125 --> 01:06:23,125
Where are you?

790
01:06:24,083 --> 01:06:25,250
<i>You be careful.</i>

791
01:06:35,250 --> 01:06:37,540
Detective Cheung. Here to see
a patient, Officer Cortez.

792
01:06:37,541 --> 01:06:39,291
Sure, let me check that for you.

793
01:06:50,750 --> 01:06:53,582
- What floor is that? What floor is he on?
- Third floor.

794
01:06:53,583 --> 01:06:56,000
Notify security. Now!

795
01:07:35,833 --> 01:07:37,958
Freeze!

796
01:07:38,541 --> 01:07:40,415
I said, freeze! Let her go.

797
01:07:40,416 --> 01:07:42,124
Fuck you, cop!

798
01:07:42,125 --> 01:07:44,666
You want her? You really want
her? You can fucking have her.

799
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:51,833
Shit.

800
01:08:21,750 --> 01:08:22,791
Don't fucking move.

801
01:08:24,916 --> 01:08:27,540
Get up.

802
01:08:27,541 --> 01:08:30,540
Okay.

803
01:08:35,833 --> 01:08:37,124
- What?
- Get in the car.

804
01:09:03,458 --> 01:09:05,290
All right. Sit down here.

805
01:09:06,291 --> 01:09:08,958
You got a first aid kit in
the cabinet, below the sink.

806
01:09:09,458 --> 01:09:11,582
Let me take a look what you got here.

807
01:09:11,583 --> 01:09:13,832
Oh Jesus, did she
try to fix that?

808
01:09:13,833 --> 01:09:15,791
Jesus fucking Christ.

809
01:09:16,791 --> 01:09:19,040
We'd be halfway to where
we're going if we had papers.

810
01:09:19,041 --> 01:09:21,999
- Yeah? Where's that exactly?
- Why? So you can tell him?

811
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:24,875
No, so I can get you a surgeon
so you don't fucking die.

812
01:09:36,958 --> 01:09:38,915
<i>Yo, Lawrence.
Listen, I got Charlie.</i>

813
01:09:38,916 --> 01:09:40,790
<i>I sent you a location
where to find him, okay?</i>

814
01:09:40,791 --> 01:09:42,207
<i>That's it. Deal closed.</i>

815
01:09:42,208 --> 01:09:44,541
<i>Come get him. You hear me?</i>

816
01:09:46,041 --> 01:09:47,041
<i>Lawrence?</i>

817
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:49,250
<i>Lawrence, you there?</i>

818
01:09:58,208 --> 01:09:59,208
Shit.

819
01:10:15,083 --> 01:10:17,500
Mrs. Walker? I'm
Detective Cheung.

820
01:10:18,125 --> 01:10:21,791
- Patrick doesn't live here anymore.
- I understand that. It, um...

821
01:10:22,666 --> 01:10:23,666
What happened?

822
01:10:29,083 --> 01:10:32,291
I'm trying to get hold of him,
and he's not answering his phone.

823
01:10:33,791 --> 01:10:36,500
He has this place,
down by the lake.

824
01:10:37,958 --> 01:10:39,583
It's his father's old cabin.

825
01:11:06,583 --> 01:11:09,750
Ching told me our sons
were friends once.

826
01:11:13,041 --> 01:11:14,166
I didn't know that.

827
01:11:21,333 --> 01:11:24,791
Perhaps they had us in common.

828
01:11:27,875 --> 01:11:30,500
Parents they were
trying to escape.

829
01:11:37,625 --> 01:11:40,708
<i>I guess that's why
they found each other.</i>

830
01:11:50,375 --> 01:11:51,416
My son Charlie

831
01:11:53,083 --> 01:11:55,458
never forgave me for
his mother's death.

832
01:11:59,416 --> 01:12:00,416
I couldn't...

833
01:12:01,583 --> 01:12:04,000
make him understand
how hard it was

834
01:12:05,291 --> 01:12:06,916
for me to watch her suffer.

835
01:12:15,458 --> 01:12:19,875
I would have done anything
to keep my son safe.

836
01:12:32,833 --> 01:12:34,958
I trust you would do the same.

837
01:13:13,750 --> 01:13:16,207
Feels like something's
missing. What's missing?

838
01:13:16,208 --> 01:13:18,040
- The buyer.
- That's right, the buyer.

839
01:13:18,041 --> 01:13:19,915
Ching, where's
the fucking buyer?

840
01:13:19,916 --> 01:13:21,124
On his way.

841
01:13:23,250 --> 01:13:24,250
Freeze!

842
01:13:27,625 --> 01:13:29,000
Don't even fucking try it.

843
01:13:39,375 --> 01:13:41,415
You don't look much
like a cop killer.

844
01:13:41,416 --> 01:13:43,333
Hard to tell you're
a cop in the dark.

845
01:14:02,791 --> 01:14:03,791
What now?

846
01:14:50,333 --> 01:14:51,333
We're leaving.

847
01:14:52,708 --> 01:14:55,166
Going to Lawrence
isn't an option for us.

848
01:14:57,875 --> 01:14:59,625
What you got in
your hand, Charlie?

849
01:15:27,500 --> 01:15:28,374
Hey!

850
01:17:31,166 --> 01:17:32,957
Come to me! Come to me!

851
01:17:44,500 --> 01:17:46,291
Go, go, go!

852
01:17:47,708 --> 01:17:48,874
Go, go!

853
01:18:50,083 --> 01:18:52,333
- Charlie!
- No, Mia! Mia, no!

854
01:19:10,083 --> 01:19:11,791
No!

855
01:19:16,666 --> 01:19:17,666
Mia!

856
01:19:35,333 --> 01:19:37,915
Stop! Fuck you!

857
01:19:42,625 --> 01:19:44,583
No! Charlie!

858
01:22:31,666 --> 01:22:32,666
Charlie?

859
01:22:36,666 --> 01:22:37,666
Charlie.

860
01:22:38,916 --> 01:22:41,583
I'm dealing with this, son. You
just... you just let me handle it.

861
01:23:06,250 --> 01:23:07,250
Your son...

862
01:23:12,500 --> 01:23:15,875
...took the one thing
I loved in this world.

863
01:23:20,833 --> 01:23:23,874
- No! No, please don't!
- Wait! No! Please, no!

864
01:23:29,041 --> 01:23:31,540
It's only fair you
do the same to him.

865
01:23:31,541 --> 01:23:32,457
No.

866
01:23:32,458 --> 01:23:34,791
No.

867
01:23:42,666 --> 01:23:43,666
Yeah.

868
01:23:53,291 --> 01:23:54,207
No.

869
01:23:54,208 --> 01:23:56,874
No! No, please
don't! It's a lie!

870
01:23:56,875 --> 01:23:58,790
- I'm sorry, son.
- No, Dad, stop!

871
01:23:58,791 --> 01:24:01,124
- It wasn't us. I didn't kill anybody!
- Please, no!

872
01:24:01,125 --> 01:24:03,832
- Hold her still.
- It wasn't us, it was the cops!

873
01:24:03,833 --> 01:24:06,624
- Hold her still. Hold her still.
- Listen to me.

874
01:24:06,625 --> 01:24:10,040
- Hold her still! Hold her still!
- No!

875
01:24:10,041 --> 01:24:11,791
- No!
- No!

876
01:24:12,750 --> 01:24:15,290
You can't do this.

877
01:24:15,291 --> 01:24:17,708
You can't do this! Please don't.

878
01:24:18,541 --> 01:24:21,915
Please, don't fucking do this. Don't
fucking do this to me again, Dad!

879
01:24:21,916 --> 01:24:24,832
- Look at me, Dad. Look at me.
- Charlie, what are you doing?

880
01:24:24,833 --> 01:24:27,374
- You shoot her, you gotta shoot me, Dad.
- Move out of the way!

881
01:24:27,375 --> 01:24:30,082
You fucking hear me? You shoot
her, you shoot through me!

882
01:24:30,083 --> 01:24:31,457
- Please!
- Shoot through me!

883
01:24:31,458 --> 01:24:33,624
- Do it.
- Shoot through me, Dad. Can you do it?

884
01:24:33,625 --> 01:24:36,499
- I promised your mom I'd take care of you.
- Now!

885
01:24:36,500 --> 01:24:38,082
No, Dad. Listen to me.

886
01:24:38,083 --> 01:24:41,083
Dad, please, I can't lose anybody
else! I can't lose anymore!

887
01:24:43,208 --> 01:24:45,125
I can't lose anymore.

888
01:24:47,958 --> 01:24:49,958
I can't... I can't.

889
01:24:56,875 --> 01:24:58,250
Put your weapons down!

890
01:24:59,208 --> 01:25:01,791
Your guns, put them down!

891
01:25:02,833 --> 01:25:06,583
They didn't kill your son. You've
been chasing the wrong people.

892
01:25:11,333 --> 01:25:12,333
Gun.

893
01:25:30,791 --> 01:25:32,191
You
betrayed my son?

894
01:25:33,125 --> 01:25:34,290
Bullshit!

895
01:25:34,291 --> 01:25:36,540
You betrayed me first!

896
01:25:36,541 --> 01:25:38,540
When Big Brother died,

897
01:25:38,541 --> 01:25:40,582
it was supposed to be my time.

898
01:25:40,583 --> 01:25:42,832
But you put that kid in
charge instead of me.

899
01:25:42,833 --> 01:25:45,541
I warned you your son
wasn't ready to lead!

900
01:25:47,125 --> 01:25:48,582
So you had him killed?

901
01:25:48,583 --> 01:25:49,875
No!

902
01:25:50,458 --> 01:25:52,624
It was these motherfuckers.

903
01:25:52,625 --> 01:25:54,332
They killed him.

904
01:25:54,333 --> 01:25:55,249
I didn't do it.

905
01:25:55,250 --> 01:25:57,541
It wasn't me.

906
01:25:58,708 --> 01:26:01,000
You ungrateful traitor...

907
01:26:02,166 --> 01:26:04,416
you killed my son!

908
01:28:06,458 --> 01:28:07,665
You okay?

909
01:28:07,666 --> 01:28:09,999
You okay? Are you okay?

910
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:11,708
Yeah. Yeah, I'm okay.

911
01:28:15,333 --> 01:28:16,333
Look at you.

912
01:28:20,166 --> 01:28:21,458
You've grown.

913
01:28:27,875 --> 01:28:29,041
Take care of her.

914
01:28:29,625 --> 01:28:31,207
I will, Dad. I will.

915
01:28:31,208 --> 01:28:32,500
Take care of her.

916
01:28:33,583 --> 01:28:34,708
Take care of her.

917
01:28:38,958 --> 01:28:39,958
Dad?

918
01:28:42,708 --> 01:28:43,708
Dad?

919
01:28:45,125 --> 01:28:46,125
Dad.

920
01:28:46,541 --> 01:28:48,416
Come on, Charlie. We gotta go.

921
01:28:48,958 --> 01:28:52,250
Come on, baby, we gotta go.
Come on, go. We gotta go.

922
01:32:37,291 --> 01:32:38,832
Don't do it.

923
01:32:44,208 --> 01:32:46,499
Why couldn't you just
let me get on that train?

924
01:32:46,500 --> 01:32:48,916
What the fuck difference
does it make to you?!

925
01:32:50,125 --> 01:32:52,208
You don't get to
walk away from this.

926
01:32:52,791 --> 01:32:54,291
Jesus Christ, Walker.

927
01:32:55,208 --> 01:32:56,999
You don't get to
fucking backpedal.

928
01:32:57,000 --> 01:32:58,290
Not after what you've done.

929
01:32:58,291 --> 01:32:59,749
I ain't gonna run no more.

930
01:32:59,750 --> 01:33:01,750
I'm proud of you.

931
01:33:02,500 --> 01:33:04,166
You can do the time
for both of us.

932
01:33:05,666 --> 01:33:07,665
Don't make me put
you down, Vince.

933
01:33:07,666 --> 01:33:08,957
Fuck you, Walker.

934
01:33:08,958 --> 01:33:10,666
We all know what you've done.

935
01:33:11,166 --> 01:33:12,166
Nah.

936
01:33:13,625 --> 01:33:14,625
Only you.

937
01:34:06,125 --> 01:34:08,541
There are still people
out there looking for you.

938
01:34:09,208 --> 01:34:12,000
- You'd be safer if you turn yourselves in.
- We'll take our chances.

939
01:34:17,000 --> 01:34:18,291
Is he gonna be okay?

940
01:34:19,833 --> 01:34:20,833
I don't know.

941
01:35:13,458 --> 01:35:14,541
What now?

942
01:35:16,541 --> 01:35:18,166
Now you should arrest me.

943
01:35:29,541 --> 01:35:31,208
You're a good cop, Ellie.

944
01:35:33,583 --> 01:35:35,143
I probably should've
been nicer to you.

945
01:35:43,250 --> 01:35:44,582
I'll make sure she gets it.

946
01:35:44,583 --> 01:35:47,708
Your daughter. I'll
take the present to her.

947
01:35:50,208 --> 01:35:51,208
No.

948
01:35:53,583 --> 01:35:55,333
I don't want to
ruin her Christmas.
