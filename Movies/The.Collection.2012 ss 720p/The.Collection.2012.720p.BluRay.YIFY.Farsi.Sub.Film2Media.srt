1
00:00:26,819 --> 00:00:28,279
Elena.

2
00:00:29,780 --> 00:00:33,451
I know this must seem like
the darkest day of your life.

3
00:00:34,243 --> 00:00:36,037
I know you miss your mother

4
00:00:37,288 --> 00:00:39,498
and even though
she's not here right now,

5
00:00:39,749 --> 00:00:41,375
she'll always love you.

6
00:00:43,377 --> 00:00:46,213
You understand that, don't you, darling?

7
00:00:46,338 --> 00:00:47,423
Yes, Daddy.

8
00:00:51,052 --> 00:00:52,845
But, I'm going to be around more.

9
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:55,723
I will always be here.

10
00:00:57,850 --> 00:00:59,477
Promise?

11
00:01:01,854 --> 00:01:03,314
I promise.

12
00:01:08,402 --> 00:01:09,779
Traps his victims...

13
00:01:10,446 --> 00:01:11,822
People still missing.

14
00:01:12,615 --> 00:01:14,116
String of murders.

15
00:01:14,241 --> 00:01:15,201
Vicious crime spree.

16
00:01:15,284 --> 00:01:16,535
We're dedicating every...

17
00:01:16,619 --> 00:01:17,579
...available resource...

18
00:01:17,661 --> 00:01:19,205
...to hunt this man down.

19
00:01:40,518 --> 00:01:41,519
A serial killer has...

20
00:01:41,602 --> 00:01:44,313
...claimed yet another victim,
in what has become...

21
00:01:44,438 --> 00:01:47,316
...the most vicious crime spree
in our city's history.

22
00:01:47,399 --> 00:01:48,484
This unprecedented...

23
00:01:48,609 --> 00:01:50,820
...series of violent murders has many...

24
00:01:51,153 --> 00:01:52,154
...staying indoors...

25
00:01:52,279 --> 00:01:53,739
...and living in fear.

26
00:01:56,742 --> 00:01:57,576
Good morning.

27
00:01:57,660 --> 00:01:59,328
Here's what we can share at this time.

28
00:02:00,287 --> 00:02:01,914
The assailant traps his victims...

29
00:02:02,206 --> 00:02:02,832
...in homes...

30
00:02:03,124 --> 00:02:04,708
...businesses, or work places...

31
00:02:05,584 --> 00:02:06,752
then kills them.

32
00:02:07,253 --> 00:02:08,254
However, it appears

33
00:02:08,379 --> 00:02:09,880
that he takes one victim
from each crime scene.

34
00:02:10,172 --> 00:02:12,383
These people may still
be alive and held captive.

35
00:02:15,219 --> 00:02:17,847
With over 50 people still missing...

36
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:20,182
...grieving families
are seeking answers...

37
00:02:20,307 --> 00:02:22,309
...and authorities have begun a manhunt.

38
00:02:22,393 --> 00:02:24,687
That's right people.
The latest in a string of murders.

39
00:02:24,812 --> 00:02:25,572
The killer seems...

40
00:02:25,604 --> 00:02:27,314
...to strike without
any pattern, which...

41
00:02:27,398 --> 00:02:29,191
...makes it impossible for police...

42
00:02:29,316 --> 00:02:31,402
...to track his moves with...

43
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:36,157
...is best described
as a predator without...

44
00:02:36,282 --> 00:02:38,284
...boundaries. Targeting men, women,

45
00:02:38,367 --> 00:02:39,577
children, young, old,

46
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:40,870
he does not discriminate.

47
00:02:41,162 --> 00:02:44,456
The latest missing person
is no stranger to crime himself.

48
00:02:44,748 --> 00:02:46,167
Arkin O'Brien is a...

49
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:48,836
...twice convicted thief
who was abducted shortly...

50
00:02:48,919 --> 00:02:51,714
...after paramedics
responded to a 9-1-1 call.

51
00:02:51,839 --> 00:02:53,549
O'Brien's wife, Lisa...

52
00:02:53,632 --> 00:02:55,676
...recently reacted to the abduction.

53
00:02:58,387 --> 00:03:00,306
Whoever's watching this.

54
00:03:00,681 --> 00:03:03,976
Please, if you see this...
and you have him...

55
00:03:04,518 --> 00:03:05,769
...please let him go.

56
00:03:06,687 --> 00:03:08,189
Please...

57
00:03:08,314 --> 00:03:09,481
...let him go.

58
00:03:19,575 --> 00:03:21,410
We will hunt this man down.

59
00:03:21,493 --> 00:03:24,705
We are on his trail and
we will bring him to justice.

60
00:03:45,726 --> 00:03:47,811
Hey. Are you here?

61
00:03:47,895 --> 00:03:50,231
Yeah, I'm not going to be able to
make it tonight, babe.

62
00:03:50,314 --> 00:03:51,565
I gotta work till close.

63
00:03:51,649 --> 00:03:54,401
I'll make it up to you though,
something real special.

64
00:03:54,485 --> 00:03:55,402
Okay?

65
00:03:55,486 --> 00:03:56,987
Who you talkin' to? Come on!

66
00:03:57,321 --> 00:03:58,822
Let's go already!

67
00:03:58,948 --> 00:03:59,573
All right?

68
00:03:59,657 --> 00:04:01,450
Okay. You're off the hook.

69
00:04:01,575 --> 00:04:02,409
Yeah?

70
00:04:02,493 --> 00:04:03,244
Yeah.

71
00:04:03,327 --> 00:04:04,008
I love you, babe.

72
00:04:04,286 --> 00:04:05,829
I love you. I love you so much.

73
00:04:06,747 --> 00:04:08,249
I love you, too.

74
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:23,930
Hey, Missy.

75
00:04:24,014 --> 00:04:25,391
What are you doing?

76
00:04:25,516 --> 00:04:28,435
Studying now. Brian bailed on me.

77
00:04:28,519 --> 00:04:31,480
Good. Get dressed.
I'm taking you to a party.

78
00:04:31,563 --> 00:04:33,607
Uh, I don't know.
I'm kind of tired.

79
00:04:33,691 --> 00:04:35,012
I think I'm just gonna go to bed.

80
00:04:35,276 --> 00:04:37,361
Yeah. Yeah, I got ya.

81
00:04:37,486 --> 00:04:38,696
Look out your window.

82
00:04:50,416 --> 00:04:51,583
I'll be down in five.

83
00:04:51,667 --> 00:04:52,668
Thank you, Marcus.

84
00:04:52,751 --> 00:04:54,712
We are now going live
to Nikki Johnson...

85
00:04:54,795 --> 00:04:56,116
...reporting live at the scene...

86
00:04:56,380 --> 00:04:57,380
...of the latest attacks.

87
00:04:57,423 --> 00:04:59,925
A serial killer
has claimed yet another victim,

88
00:05:00,050 --> 00:05:04,013
in what has become the most vicious
crime spree in our city's history.

89
00:05:04,305 --> 00:05:07,349
This unprecedented series
of violent murders

90
00:05:07,433 --> 00:05:10,644
has many staying indoors
and living in fear.

91
00:05:10,728 --> 00:05:14,565
And now, with over 50 people
still missing grieving families...

92
00:05:14,648 --> 00:05:15,941
...are seeking answers...

93
00:05:19,903 --> 00:05:21,739
Did I pick the right shirt?

94
00:05:22,364 --> 00:05:23,657
It's not about the shirt,
little brother.

95
00:05:23,782 --> 00:05:25,075
It's about how you wear it.

96
00:05:25,367 --> 00:05:28,329
All girls say that,
dude, and none of it is true.

97
00:05:28,662 --> 00:05:30,581
Every detail counts.

98
00:05:30,706 --> 00:05:31,749
I've been workin' on some lines...

99
00:05:31,832 --> 00:05:33,375
- ...and I was thinkin' that if I...
- Okay, stop.

100
00:05:33,459 --> 00:05:35,002
First off, don't call me dude.

101
00:05:35,085 --> 00:05:36,587
Look, when you
wanna be with a woman

102
00:05:36,712 --> 00:05:37,963
you don't walk up to her and say, hi,

103
00:05:38,047 --> 00:05:39,715
I'd like to sleep with you.

104
00:05:39,798 --> 00:05:42,343
You say, nice shoes.

105
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:44,386
Does that make sense?

106
00:05:44,470 --> 00:05:45,054
Hmm.

107
00:05:45,387 --> 00:05:47,890
Just try wearing some
confidence for a change.

108
00:05:49,350 --> 00:05:50,893
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

109
00:05:52,770 --> 00:05:53,937
Hey, Josh.

110
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:56,690
Nice shoes.

111
00:06:14,416 --> 00:06:15,918
I can't believe your dad
let you out the house

112
00:06:16,001 --> 00:06:17,836
- with that psycho on the loose.
- He didn't.

113
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:18,712
Really?

114
00:06:18,796 --> 00:06:20,547
Where is this place, anyway?

115
00:06:20,672 --> 00:06:21,673
It's private here.

116
00:06:21,757 --> 00:06:24,009
Password to get in.

117
00:06:24,510 --> 00:06:25,844
Which is what?

118
00:06:25,928 --> 00:06:27,137
Nevermore.

119
00:06:27,846 --> 00:06:30,724
Wow, this... really looks inviting.

120
00:06:32,393 --> 00:06:33,977
This has to be it.

121
00:06:36,605 --> 00:06:38,649
Okay, that's gotta be the door guy.

122
00:06:38,774 --> 00:06:40,609
Go tell him the password.

123
00:06:42,069 --> 00:06:43,654
Um...

124
00:06:45,614 --> 00:06:46,782
...nevermore.

125
00:08:00,522 --> 00:08:02,065
Nice shoes.

126
00:10:10,819 --> 00:10:11,945
Stay down!

127
00:10:13,238 --> 00:10:14,615
Stay here!

128
00:11:07,084 --> 00:11:08,085
Get out of my way!

129
00:11:08,210 --> 00:11:09,086
Move!

130
00:11:09,211 --> 00:11:10,420
Move!

131
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:14,007
Move, bitch!

132
00:11:15,217 --> 00:11:16,218
Whoa... whoa, whoa, whoa!

133
00:11:16,301 --> 00:11:17,719
Fuck!

134
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:30,023
Stay down.

135
00:11:31,149 --> 00:11:32,442
You gotta help me.

136
00:11:32,984 --> 00:11:33,985
You gotta help, come on.

137
00:11:34,069 --> 00:11:35,278
- You gotta help me.
- No!

138
00:11:36,363 --> 00:11:38,073
Help me. You gotta help me.

139
00:11:55,716 --> 00:11:56,837
- Move!
- Man, what happened?

140
00:11:56,842 --> 00:11:58,468
- What is it?
- Brian?

141
00:12:04,725 --> 00:12:06,476
Oh, shit. This way, over here.

142
00:12:14,359 --> 00:12:15,485
Shit!

143
00:12:19,823 --> 00:12:21,116
Oh, my God!

144
00:12:39,843 --> 00:12:41,386
Elle! Elle!

145
00:12:41,470 --> 00:12:44,014
Elle! Please! Oh, my God!

146
00:12:44,097 --> 00:12:45,348
It won't stop!

147
00:12:45,474 --> 00:12:46,933
Help me!

148
00:12:47,017 --> 00:12:49,478
- Push on it, Missy! Push on it!
- Can you shut it off?!

149
00:12:50,187 --> 00:12:51,062
No!

150
00:13:13,335 --> 00:13:15,337
Push on it, Missy! Push on it!

151
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:17,255
No! No!

152
00:14:08,473 --> 00:14:09,850
Look out!

153
00:15:17,125 --> 00:15:18,165
Okay. What do we got here?

154
00:15:18,209 --> 00:15:19,461
- I need you to stay calm.
- Where's my family?

155
00:15:19,586 --> 00:15:21,296
- Where's my wife at?
- I need you to stay calm.

156
00:15:21,379 --> 00:15:23,214
- My arm hurts bad.
- Pack it in...

157
00:15:23,298 --> 00:15:24,257
...20 milligrams of Versidep...

158
00:15:24,382 --> 00:15:25,467
...push 10 milligrams of morphine.

159
00:15:25,550 --> 00:15:26,551
Right now.

160
00:15:26,635 --> 00:15:27,427
Can you tell me your name?

161
00:15:27,552 --> 00:15:28,470
Arkin.

162
00:15:28,553 --> 00:15:30,639
Please note scratches on subject's
right arm are self-inflicted.

163
00:15:30,931 --> 00:15:33,516
- Hold on to him please.
- 1... 2... 3...

164
00:15:33,642 --> 00:15:35,685
Oh, fuck!

165
00:15:36,186 --> 00:15:37,520
Hey, we need
some help in here right now!

166
00:15:37,646 --> 00:15:39,689
Let's go! Over here, hold him down.

167
00:15:39,981 --> 00:15:41,066
Hold his arm down.

168
00:15:41,149 --> 00:15:44,152
Morphine, push 10 milligrams. Now!

169
00:15:44,235 --> 00:15:45,320
Hey, you can't be in here

170
00:15:45,403 --> 00:15:46,571
- Hey, come on. Step back.
- What the fuck is goin' on?

171
00:15:46,655 --> 00:15:49,240
- Get out of here!
- Cuff him! Cuff him!

172
00:15:49,324 --> 00:15:50,659
Whoa. Okay, okay.

173
00:15:50,951 --> 00:15:52,410
Okay, easy guys.

174
00:15:52,494 --> 00:15:54,245
Okay? Easy.

175
00:16:14,224 --> 00:16:16,059
Get it off me! Get it off me!

176
00:16:21,982 --> 00:16:23,108
Lisa.

177
00:16:32,117 --> 00:16:33,994
I thought I'd never see you again.

178
00:16:36,037 --> 00:16:37,414
You ain't that lucky.

179
00:16:41,084 --> 00:16:42,419
What happened to you?

180
00:16:46,381 --> 00:16:50,760
It's okay, baby. I've got you now.

181
00:16:53,596 --> 00:16:55,640
You didn't have to get me flowers.

182
00:16:59,227 --> 00:17:01,021
- I didn't.
- What's that say?

183
00:17:03,064 --> 00:17:04,315
What's it say?

184
00:17:05,191 --> 00:17:06,651
For the collection.

185
00:17:08,486 --> 00:17:11,322
Get well soon,
can't wait to meet the family.

186
00:17:12,782 --> 00:17:14,492
What's wrong?

187
00:17:14,617 --> 00:17:16,286
What's wrong?

188
00:17:16,369 --> 00:17:17,454
What?

189
00:17:17,537 --> 00:17:19,205
Listen to me.

190
00:17:19,581 --> 00:17:21,207
Baby, you got to go to your moms.

191
00:17:21,291 --> 00:17:23,251
- No.
- Go now.

192
00:17:23,334 --> 00:17:25,094
- No.
- Don't tell anyone where you're going.

193
00:17:25,211 --> 00:17:26,379
Don't even pack a bag.

194
00:17:26,504 --> 00:17:28,715
- No, please.
- Go.

195
00:17:29,507 --> 00:17:30,842
- Okay.
- Go, now.

196
00:17:36,181 --> 00:17:37,515
I've got it from here, bud.

197
00:17:40,685 --> 00:17:42,062
Have a good night.

198
00:17:54,157 --> 00:17:55,408
Hello, Arkin.

199
00:17:55,825 --> 00:17:57,619
I told you guys everything I know.

200
00:17:58,203 --> 00:17:59,496
I'm not a cop.

201
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:01,456
Who are you?

202
00:18:01,581 --> 00:18:03,249
My name's Lucello.

203
00:18:05,502 --> 00:18:07,295
Yo, what the fuck are you doin'?

204
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:10,090
Relax. I'm here to help you.

205
00:18:10,215 --> 00:18:12,509
I'm working for a man
whose daughter's gone missing.

206
00:18:13,093 --> 00:18:14,552
Did you see her at the party?

207
00:18:26,439 --> 00:18:27,649
Yeah.

208
00:18:28,399 --> 00:18:29,818
Was she alive?

209
00:18:30,110 --> 00:18:31,653
Last time I saw her.

210
00:18:32,695 --> 00:18:34,322
Did he take her?

211
00:18:36,241 --> 00:18:38,451
If you didn't find a body, then maybe.

212
00:18:38,576 --> 00:18:40,161
He always takes one.

213
00:18:40,537 --> 00:18:42,122
Her name's Elena.

214
00:18:43,665 --> 00:18:47,544
I've got 48 hours tops
before she's dead.

215
00:18:47,627 --> 00:18:50,630
I think you have a pretty good idea
where that man might be.

216
00:18:51,214 --> 00:18:52,715
What makes you think
you're gonna find this guy

217
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:53,883
when the cops can't?

218
00:18:54,217 --> 00:18:56,386
Because I am
willing to do things they won't.

219
00:18:56,886 --> 00:19:00,348
I have assembled a team
and we are gonna find him and kill him.

220
00:19:05,270 --> 00:19:06,604
What's the plan?

221
00:19:07,897 --> 00:19:10,316
He's gonna lead us to
where Elena's being held.

222
00:19:10,775 --> 00:19:12,318
What about the police?

223
00:19:13,570 --> 00:19:15,196
They had their chance.

224
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:17,615
What this man deserves
is beyond the law.

225
00:19:19,367 --> 00:19:23,329
She's all I have. Find her.

226
00:19:23,413 --> 00:19:25,290
Sir, I've always been there for you.

227
00:19:25,415 --> 00:19:27,208
She'll be home tonight.

228
00:19:27,292 --> 00:19:28,668
Thank you, Lucello.

229
00:19:42,182 --> 00:19:43,266
Lena.

230
00:19:43,391 --> 00:19:45,226
Dad!

231
00:19:46,352 --> 00:19:47,687
Daddy!

232
00:19:48,229 --> 00:19:53,318
- Elena!
- Daddy!

233
00:19:56,571 --> 00:19:58,239
I got you.

234
00:19:58,323 --> 00:19:59,741
I got ya.

235
00:20:07,248 --> 00:20:08,416
Hello?

236
00:20:08,541 --> 00:20:10,543
Who's... who's out there?

237
00:20:11,336 --> 00:20:13,421
Oh, my God.

238
00:20:35,777 --> 00:20:38,780
Get away!

239
00:20:40,490 --> 00:20:41,699
Get away from me!

240
00:20:41,783 --> 00:20:43,451
Get away! Get away!

241
00:20:43,534 --> 00:20:46,329
Please! Get... get...

242
00:20:46,704 --> 00:20:48,248
Get away from me!

243
00:22:06,659 --> 00:22:07,827
We're goin' in for the girl tonight.

244
00:22:07,952 --> 00:22:09,704
And this man, Arkin O'Brien,

245
00:22:09,787 --> 00:22:12,415
is our best chance
to bring her home alive.

246
00:22:13,416 --> 00:22:15,043
Let's be clear about one thing.

247
00:22:16,377 --> 00:22:18,004
I'll help you get there...

248
00:22:19,881 --> 00:22:21,966
...but I will not go inside.

249
00:22:22,633 --> 00:22:23,801
Understood.

250
00:22:24,010 --> 00:22:26,804
You help us find Elena, you walk...

251
00:22:27,013 --> 00:22:28,639
...we do the rest.

252
00:22:29,932 --> 00:22:31,976
Now tell us what we need to know.

253
00:22:32,518 --> 00:22:35,118
If you're gonna find this guy,
you gotta start at the beginning...

254
00:22:38,066 --> 00:22:39,984
...when he threw me into that red trunk.

255
00:22:51,913 --> 00:22:54,791
I cut my forearm
every time I got to 100.

256
00:22:58,461 --> 00:23:00,797
When we turned right
or left I made distinct cuts.

257
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:03,007
Drive five miles under the speed limit,

258
00:23:03,091 --> 00:23:05,051
stop fully at every stop sign,

259
00:23:05,134 --> 00:23:06,928
don't gun the engine
through the yellows.

260
00:23:07,053 --> 00:23:07,929
Follow my instructions...

261
00:23:08,012 --> 00:23:10,681
I'll take you right to
where he took me. Right.

262
00:23:14,852 --> 00:23:16,771
But you better be prepared, man.

263
00:23:17,105 --> 00:23:18,689
Bring everything you've got.

264
00:23:19,148 --> 00:23:20,066
Because if he... catches you,

265
00:23:20,149 --> 00:23:21,984
he's gonna make you wish you were dead.

266
00:23:23,403 --> 00:23:24,612
Left.

267
00:23:25,113 --> 00:23:26,531
You're not gonna walk
in there like this is...

268
00:23:26,614 --> 00:23:28,491
Sunday dinner because this is his house,

269
00:23:28,616 --> 00:23:31,119
and he will cut your balls off
and feed them to you.

270
00:23:35,665 --> 00:23:36,749
Stop.

271
00:23:57,645 --> 00:24:00,148
This hotel has been
abandoned for years.

272
00:24:00,690 --> 00:24:02,150
This is the place.

273
00:24:07,947 --> 00:24:09,115
You're the expert.

274
00:24:09,449 --> 00:24:10,950
Think you can get us in there?

275
00:24:11,534 --> 00:24:13,453
I'll get you in then I'm outta here.

276
00:24:49,697 --> 00:24:50,948
Oh, God.

277
00:25:04,253 --> 00:25:05,713
Hello?

278
00:27:10,796 --> 00:27:11,922
Watch your back in there.

279
00:27:12,048 --> 00:27:14,717
It's built like a maze.
The whole place is rigged.

280
00:27:15,885 --> 00:27:17,678
That's why you're leading us in.

281
00:27:20,848 --> 00:27:23,809
What are you talkin' about?
That wasn't the fuckin' deal.

282
00:27:25,186 --> 00:27:26,987
It's the same deal Arkin.
I'll kill the guy...

283
00:27:27,021 --> 00:27:28,689
...but you've gotta help us find Elena.

284
00:27:28,814 --> 00:27:30,494
What makes you think
I know where she's at?

285
00:27:30,650 --> 00:27:32,130
Because you're the only person I know

286
00:27:32,193 --> 00:27:35,071
to see the inside
of this hotel and live.

287
00:27:41,369 --> 00:27:42,745
Ladies first.

288
00:27:42,870 --> 00:27:44,121
Eat a dick.

289
00:27:47,833 --> 00:27:49,669
Guard the door. Stay on the radio.

290
00:28:55,735 --> 00:28:57,194
There's something moving in there.

291
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:00,239
No way, man.

292
00:29:00,322 --> 00:29:02,992
Point that gun at my head.
No fuckin' way... I'm not goin'.

293
00:29:03,451 --> 00:29:04,952
You already abandoned that girl once.

294
00:29:05,077 --> 00:29:06,495
You gonna do it again?

295
00:29:09,915 --> 00:29:12,251
At least give me something
to protect myself with.

296
00:29:17,214 --> 00:29:18,382
Are you kiddin' me?

297
00:29:18,507 --> 00:29:19,550
Nope.

298
00:30:13,270 --> 00:30:14,522
Lin?

299
00:30:37,378 --> 00:30:38,420
What?

300
00:30:47,513 --> 00:30:48,556
Fuck!

301
00:30:50,516 --> 00:30:51,892
What the fuck was that?

302
00:30:54,019 --> 00:30:55,187
Are you okay?

303
00:31:01,902 --> 00:31:03,946
His tongue's been chewed off.

304
00:31:04,530 --> 00:31:06,615
His pupils are completely blown out.

305
00:31:07,491 --> 00:31:09,952
This guy's been coked out of his mind.

306
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:12,538
He messes with 'em, jacks 'em up.

307
00:31:12,621 --> 00:31:15,416
They don't do what he says,
he turns him into his dogs.

308
00:31:17,209 --> 00:31:18,252
It's like a zombie.

309
00:31:18,377 --> 00:31:19,879
He's not a zombie.

310
00:31:20,004 --> 00:31:23,257
He's just a person
or what's left of him.

311
00:31:23,883 --> 00:31:26,552
There's enough drugs here
to turn anyone into an animal.

312
00:31:30,514 --> 00:31:31,682
Holy shit.

313
00:31:33,017 --> 00:31:34,685
What is this place?

314
00:31:40,316 --> 00:31:41,483
Okay, listen up.

315
00:31:41,609 --> 00:31:43,235
Here's what we're gonna do.

316
00:31:44,278 --> 00:31:45,613
One...

317
00:31:53,245 --> 00:31:55,080
Shit. What the fuck?

318
00:32:17,978 --> 00:32:19,980
Come here. Come on. This way.

319
00:32:20,981 --> 00:32:21,482
Come on!

320
00:32:21,607 --> 00:32:22,691
Fucked

321
00:32:25,653 --> 00:32:27,154
Fuckin' shit!

322
00:32:30,449 --> 00:32:32,117
Come on, guys!

323
00:32:32,993 --> 00:32:34,036
Hold there.

324
00:32:34,119 --> 00:32:35,329
I got a gun!

325
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:39,416
What the fuck?!

326
00:32:42,002 --> 00:32:42,962
And, you.

327
00:32:43,045 --> 00:32:45,714
This asshole! Fuckin' walked us
right into that fuckin' shit!

328
00:32:46,006 --> 00:32:48,050
- Relax!
- My cell's worthless.

329
00:32:48,384 --> 00:32:50,135
I'm not getting any signal down here.

330
00:32:52,137 --> 00:32:53,514
We're gettin' jammed.

331
00:32:54,223 --> 00:32:56,183
All right, the police will be
all over this place any second.

332
00:32:56,308 --> 00:32:57,393
We're in a concrete tomb,

333
00:32:57,518 --> 00:32:58,727
1o feet underground
in a part of the city

334
00:32:59,019 --> 00:33:00,312
that rats won't even shit on.

335
00:33:00,396 --> 00:33:02,982
Nobody's gonna hear us because
there's no one around to listen.

336
00:33:03,107 --> 00:33:04,191
Okay?

337
00:33:04,316 --> 00:33:05,651
All right, let's get movin'.

338
00:33:07,236 --> 00:33:08,570
Stay close.

339
00:33:26,547 --> 00:33:28,048
Who's out there?

340
00:33:28,382 --> 00:33:29,717
I can hear you.

341
00:33:30,259 --> 00:33:34,013
Please, let me out? Please?

342
00:33:43,731 --> 00:33:46,108
I can... I can get you out,
but you have to be quiet. Okay?

343
00:33:46,191 --> 00:33:47,526
Okay.

344
00:34:15,512 --> 00:34:16,513
Who are you?

345
00:34:16,597 --> 00:34:17,639
Who are you?

346
00:34:17,723 --> 00:34:19,183
How did you get out?

347
00:34:19,308 --> 00:34:20,851
Did... did he let you out?

348
00:34:21,143 --> 00:34:23,145
He didn't let me out. I got out.

349
00:34:32,738 --> 00:34:34,573
He did this to me.

350
00:34:37,117 --> 00:34:39,828
I'm Elena. What's your name?

351
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:41,413
Abby.

352
00:34:44,124 --> 00:34:46,335
Do you know your way around here?

353
00:34:46,418 --> 00:34:47,461
Oh, no, no, no.

354
00:34:47,586 --> 00:34:48,712
We can't leave this room.

355
00:34:48,796 --> 00:34:49,713
No, no, no.

356
00:34:49,838 --> 00:34:51,173
- Abby.
- We can't just go.

357
00:34:51,256 --> 00:34:52,800
We can get out of here, okay?

358
00:34:54,301 --> 00:34:55,719
Okay, come on.

359
00:34:56,804 --> 00:34:58,347
Come on.

360
00:35:12,611 --> 00:35:13,779
The footprints.

361
00:35:13,862 --> 00:35:15,572
Look at the spacing.

362
00:35:16,532 --> 00:35:17,783
Hands up!

363
00:35:19,618 --> 00:35:20,702
Stop.

364
00:35:20,786 --> 00:35:21,787
Please.

365
00:35:21,912 --> 00:35:23,413
Stay back!

366
00:35:23,539 --> 00:35:24,581
Please, help me.

367
00:35:24,706 --> 00:35:25,874
What the fuck is this?!

368
00:35:26,166 --> 00:35:28,794
Stop right there or we'll shoot!

369
00:35:32,422 --> 00:35:33,757
I didn't make it.

370
00:35:33,882 --> 00:35:35,425
I didn't make it.

371
00:35:35,551 --> 00:35:37,636
What didn't you make?

372
00:35:38,345 --> 00:35:39,847
The collection.

373
00:35:43,642 --> 00:35:45,602
And neither will you!

374
00:35:46,270 --> 00:35:47,437
Get back!

375
00:36:11,879 --> 00:36:13,463
Where's Arkin?

376
00:36:18,552 --> 00:36:21,597
Arkin? There.

377
00:37:41,718 --> 00:37:43,512
You don't wanna go in there.

378
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:54,690
Oh...

379
00:37:55,816 --> 00:37:56,942
...thanks.

380
00:37:57,025 --> 00:37:58,777
We should keep moving.

381
00:38:00,779 --> 00:38:01,989
Yeah.

382
00:38:04,908 --> 00:38:06,660
He likes me, you know.

383
00:38:06,785 --> 00:38:10,038
Wait? What do you mean he likes...

384
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,543
You'll never win.

385
00:38:14,626 --> 00:38:15,906
- What?
- You have a hearing aid.

386
00:38:15,919 --> 00:38:18,005
You're not strong enough,
you're at a disadvantage.

387
00:38:18,297 --> 00:38:19,577
- You can't win.
- Shh. Be quiet.

388
00:38:19,673 --> 00:38:20,465
You weren't even supposed to get out!

389
00:38:20,549 --> 00:38:21,633
- Shh.
- He's testing me!

390
00:38:21,717 --> 00:38:23,357
- Be quiet, okay?
- He's testing me again!

391
00:38:23,385 --> 00:38:24,761
- Be quiet. He's gonna hear you.
- Get away from me!

392
00:38:24,845 --> 00:38:26,555
Get away from me!

393
00:44:23,870 --> 00:44:26,122
Help me. Please.

394
00:44:27,666 --> 00:44:29,042
Help me.

395
00:44:44,015 --> 00:44:45,266
Please.

396
00:44:49,312 --> 00:44:50,814
Please.

397
00:44:55,735 --> 00:44:56,986
Help me.

398
00:45:01,741 --> 00:45:02,951
Please.

399
00:46:31,831 --> 00:46:34,417
Hey! Hey, up here!

400
00:46:34,501 --> 00:46:36,211
Somebody help me!

401
00:47:05,615 --> 00:47:07,492
You're at the bad end of good luck.

402
00:47:08,535 --> 00:47:10,495
I told you,
you should have cut his heels.

403
00:47:11,579 --> 00:47:13,780
Paz, put something right here
so he can't so he can't...

404
00:47:13,873 --> 00:47:15,333
Paz, give it to me.

405
00:47:16,417 --> 00:47:17,544
Kept you on a leash.

406
00:47:17,836 --> 00:47:19,212
Let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go.

407
00:47:19,295 --> 00:47:21,005
Love this shit man.

408
00:47:22,215 --> 00:47:25,176
It hurts... hold his hands.

409
00:47:25,260 --> 00:47:28,304
- Guys up!
- Stay down, you son of a bitch.

410
00:47:28,972 --> 00:47:30,598
- Wally!

411
00:48:08,678 --> 00:48:10,513
Hey! Help me!

412
00:48:11,014 --> 00:48:12,390
Help me!

413
00:48:16,436 --> 00:48:19,564
No win. He's picking
us off one by one.

414
00:48:19,647 --> 00:48:21,316
If you want to live
you've got to start...

415
00:48:21,399 --> 00:48:23,359
...listening to me
before he takes us apart

416
00:48:23,484 --> 00:48:25,364
and hangs us on the wall
of his fucking gallery!

417
00:48:25,445 --> 00:48:26,946
We've got to work together

418
00:48:27,071 --> 00:48:28,281
and get the hell out of here.

419
00:48:28,406 --> 00:48:29,949
I am not leaving without her.

420
00:48:30,074 --> 00:48:33,953
If you haven't found her by now,
she's probably dead.

421
00:48:34,078 --> 00:48:36,915
I have been watching over her
since she was a little girl.

422
00:48:37,040 --> 00:48:38,416
I promised her father...

423
00:48:45,006 --> 00:48:46,591
I know where she is...

424
00:48:49,260 --> 00:48:51,220
...but you've got to get me out of here.

425
00:49:05,360 --> 00:49:06,569
That way.

426
00:49:11,115 --> 00:49:12,325
Are you sure?

427
00:49:12,450 --> 00:49:13,952
Mm-hmmm.

428
00:49:24,295 --> 00:49:27,256
No. No, no, no.

429
00:49:28,049 --> 00:49:31,177
It's not Elena. It's Paz.

430
00:49:44,691 --> 00:49:45,733
Where you goin'?

431
00:49:46,025 --> 00:49:47,276
Where you goin'?

432
00:49:47,360 --> 00:49:48,277
It's a trap.

433
00:49:48,403 --> 00:49:49,320
He's trying to
lure us away from Elena.

434
00:49:49,445 --> 00:49:50,571
You're just going to let Paz die?

435
00:49:50,655 --> 00:49:52,198
My objective is Elena.

436
00:49:52,281 --> 00:49:54,450
Dude, fuck your objective.
Can't you hear that?

437
00:49:54,534 --> 00:49:56,703
Don't act like you don't give a fuck.

438
00:49:59,330 --> 00:50:01,332
Help!

439
00:50:30,403 --> 00:50:33,781
Stay with her. Stay with her.

440
00:50:36,200 --> 00:50:38,161
Help me!

441
00:50:40,538 --> 00:50:43,708
Help me! Help me!

442
00:50:44,625 --> 00:50:46,377
In here!

443
00:50:53,134 --> 00:50:56,345
Wait! No! Help!

444
00:51:44,435 --> 00:51:47,105
Hey. Hey.

445
00:51:47,188 --> 00:51:49,273
Get me down.
Can you get me down?

446
00:51:50,483 --> 00:51:54,445
- Help, no, turn around.
- I got you. Okay?

447
00:51:54,570 --> 00:51:55,696
I got you. Okay?

448
00:51:58,199 --> 00:52:00,701
Get out of there! Come on!

449
00:52:30,481 --> 00:52:31,649
That way.

450
00:52:32,483 --> 00:52:34,235
Go. Go.

451
00:52:37,363 --> 00:52:38,281
- Get me out!
- Elena.

452
00:52:38,364 --> 00:52:39,574
Oh! Get it off!

453
00:52:39,657 --> 00:52:41,450
- You.
- He's coming.

454
00:52:41,951 --> 00:52:43,661
Get me out of this fucking thing!

455
00:52:43,744 --> 00:52:45,454
Get me out of this thing!

456
00:52:45,580 --> 00:52:46,747
Get it off!

457
00:52:47,582 --> 00:52:49,167
Lucello.

458
00:52:50,918 --> 00:52:52,211
Oh, God.

459
00:52:52,336 --> 00:52:55,631
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

460
00:52:55,715 --> 00:52:56,796
It's okay. Okay? It's okay.

461
00:52:56,883 --> 00:52:58,283
We're going to get you out of here.

462
00:52:58,342 --> 00:53:00,761
Okay? Let's go. I'm here.

463
00:53:04,557 --> 00:53:06,184
No. No, don't trust her.

464
00:53:06,309 --> 00:53:07,268
No. She's crazy.

465
00:53:07,351 --> 00:53:08,551
- Okay. Wait, wait, wait.
- No.

466
00:53:08,561 --> 00:53:09,645
Look at me.

467
00:53:09,770 --> 00:53:11,814
You're safe. You're safe.

468
00:53:13,900 --> 00:53:15,526
- We gotta go now.
- Yes.

469
00:53:15,651 --> 00:53:16,736
Come on. Let's go.

470
00:53:16,819 --> 00:53:18,362
I think I know a way out.

471
00:53:18,946 --> 00:53:20,698
Let's go. Come on.

472
00:53:26,746 --> 00:53:28,456
How many shots you got left?

473
00:53:28,581 --> 00:53:29,749
Two.

474
00:53:31,417 --> 00:53:32,919
Give me the gun.

475
00:53:33,211 --> 00:53:34,670
Not a chance.
We are on the third floor.

476
00:53:34,754 --> 00:53:36,380
I'm leading us out
the way we came in.

477
00:53:36,505 --> 00:53:38,507
We can't make it with
those things down there.

478
00:53:39,717 --> 00:53:41,302
Look, man.

479
00:53:41,385 --> 00:53:43,471
It's time for you to trust me.

480
00:53:46,682 --> 00:53:48,267
Give me the gun.

481
00:53:48,351 --> 00:53:49,435
If I would have wanted you dead

482
00:53:49,518 --> 00:53:51,646
I wouldn't have saved
your ass back there.

483
00:53:52,230 --> 00:53:53,522
You left me.

484
00:53:57,485 --> 00:54:00,363
Look, there was nothin' I could do.

485
00:54:00,446 --> 00:54:02,657
All right? I'm sorry.
There was nothin' I could do.

486
00:54:03,491 --> 00:54:06,619
I can get us out of here
if you give me the fuckin' gun.

487
00:54:21,884 --> 00:54:23,564
What the hell?
Did you just shoot somebody?

488
00:54:23,678 --> 00:54:25,554
Shots fired attracts attention.

489
00:54:26,347 --> 00:54:27,515
Sorry, dude.

490
00:54:27,848 --> 00:54:29,725
Man down attracts cops.

491
00:54:30,851 --> 00:54:32,270
Well played.

492
00:54:46,742 --> 00:54:49,912
Gunshot on the upper
right side multiple suspects.

493
00:54:57,295 --> 00:55:00,006
Gotta let them know
exactly where we're at.

494
00:55:06,304 --> 00:55:08,514
We have shots fired!
I repeat, shots fired!

495
00:55:08,597 --> 00:55:09,432
Need back up.

496
00:55:09,515 --> 00:55:12,601
1167 Tracy lane,
the old Sargento Hotel.

497
00:55:12,685 --> 00:55:14,645
Shots coming from the north tower.

498
00:55:19,317 --> 00:55:21,986
Just need to hole up
not draw attention to ourselves

499
00:55:22,111 --> 00:55:23,551
and wait for them to raid the joint.

500
00:55:23,612 --> 00:55:24,947
Sounds simple enough.

501
00:55:30,328 --> 00:55:31,746
What the fuck did you just do?

502
00:55:32,788 --> 00:55:35,708
- Oh, God.
- He likes me, you know.

503
00:55:35,791 --> 00:55:36,917
I told you.

504
00:55:37,918 --> 00:55:41,005
They're here!

505
00:55:42,590 --> 00:55:43,883
Shut up! Shut up!

506
00:55:44,008 --> 00:55:45,551
You're all gonna die!

507
00:55:45,634 --> 00:55:47,011
Shut the fuck up!

508
00:56:55,413 --> 00:56:56,497
Let's go.

509
00:56:57,498 --> 00:56:58,874
I can't.

510
00:57:07,758 --> 00:57:09,176
Oh, my God.

511
00:57:15,474 --> 00:57:16,892
Go. Now. Save her.

512
00:57:17,017 --> 00:57:18,853
We're not leaving you like this.

513
00:57:23,732 --> 00:57:24,817
Arkin...

514
00:57:24,900 --> 00:57:26,444
...bring Elena home.

515
00:57:29,572 --> 00:57:30,781
Go!

516
00:57:31,073 --> 00:57:32,491
Go, now!

517
00:57:32,992 --> 00:57:34,243
Go, now!

518
00:57:34,535 --> 00:57:36,912
- Go!
- Okay. Okay.

519
00:57:41,584 --> 00:57:42,751
Fuck.

520
00:57:58,476 --> 00:57:59,477
Team in position.

521
00:57:59,560 --> 00:58:00,853
Go, go, go!

522
00:58:01,770 --> 00:58:03,189
Red team take your six.

523
00:58:04,523 --> 00:58:05,774
Wait for my word.

524
00:58:08,152 --> 00:58:09,778
Weapons tight.

525
00:58:22,958 --> 00:58:24,084
What is it?

526
00:58:24,710 --> 00:58:27,505
No, it's a trap!

527
00:58:28,881 --> 00:58:29,882
Shit.

528
00:58:29,965 --> 00:58:31,258
I tried to tell you.

529
00:58:43,312 --> 00:58:44,813
Fuck you!

530
00:58:44,939 --> 00:58:46,524
You're him, bro.

531
00:58:47,107 --> 00:58:48,817
What are you doin', man?

532
00:58:51,946 --> 00:58:53,113
Come on! Fuck you!

533
00:58:53,197 --> 00:58:54,698
You piece of shit!

534
00:58:54,949 --> 00:58:56,534
You remember me?

535
00:58:56,617 --> 00:58:57,660
You remember me?

536
00:58:57,743 --> 00:58:59,578
Huh?

537
00:58:59,662 --> 00:59:01,997
Oh yeah. You remember me,
don't you?

538
00:59:05,042 --> 00:59:07,920
Okay. Here I am, fucker.
Fuck you! Come on!

539
00:59:08,045 --> 00:59:10,047
- Fuckin' cock!
- Come on inside this cage, bitch!

540
00:59:10,172 --> 00:59:12,925
Come on. I'd love to fuckin'
have a piece of you!

541
00:59:13,050 --> 00:59:14,093
Come on, man!

542
00:59:14,218 --> 00:59:15,678
I'll fuckin' eat your heart!

543
00:59:15,761 --> 00:59:17,763
I'll tear it out of your fuckin' throat!

544
00:59:17,846 --> 00:59:20,307
Come on! Come on, you fuckin' pussy!

545
00:59:20,599 --> 00:59:22,017
What kind of pussy are you?

546
00:59:22,101 --> 00:59:23,894
Pussy, pussy.

547
00:59:23,978 --> 00:59:26,313
Come here, you little pussy. Come on!

548
00:59:26,647 --> 00:59:28,023
- No! No!
- What are you doin'?

549
00:59:28,148 --> 00:59:29,191
Come and get me!

550
00:59:29,316 --> 00:59:30,693
What are you gonna do?

551
00:59:30,818 --> 00:59:31,694
You gonna kill me?

552
00:59:31,777 --> 00:59:33,612
You come in here and do it.

553
00:59:33,737 --> 00:59:35,239
- You come in here.
- No! No!

554
00:59:35,322 --> 00:59:38,826
- No! No!
- What are you doing?

555
00:59:38,951 --> 00:59:40,744
You come and do it!

556
00:59:42,997 --> 00:59:43,831
No!

557
00:59:43,914 --> 00:59:45,755
No! We gotta get out.
We gotta get... we gotta...

558
00:59:45,791 --> 00:59:47,793
ls there a way out? See if you can
fit your hand through.

559
00:59:47,876 --> 00:59:48,669
- Can you fit it through?
- Pull.

560
00:59:48,752 --> 00:59:51,005
- Where's the fuckin' knife?
- It slides right here.

561
00:59:51,088 --> 00:59:52,590
Grab the latch and pull it.

562
00:59:52,715 --> 00:59:54,341
- I can't do it!
- Come on. Take it out.

563
00:59:54,633 --> 00:59:56,353
Take it out.
I'm gonna try and get the knife

564
00:59:56,594 --> 00:59:57,395
Slide it towards me.

565
00:59:57,678 --> 00:59:58,804
Okay. Towards you.

566
00:59:58,887 --> 01:00:02,850
- Almost got it.
- I've got it! I got it, I got it!

567
01:00:02,975 --> 01:00:04,685
No! No, no, no.

568
01:00:04,810 --> 01:00:06,145
Shit!

569
01:00:16,280 --> 01:00:17,740
There's gotta be another way.

570
01:00:17,823 --> 01:00:18,991
There's gotta be.

571
01:00:26,832 --> 01:00:29,001
What are you doing? Stop it.

572
01:00:29,084 --> 01:00:30,377
What are you doing?

573
01:00:39,345 --> 01:00:41,639
I need you to step on my forearm.

574
01:00:42,222 --> 01:00:44,141
I need you to re-break it.

575
01:00:44,224 --> 01:00:46,644
- What?
Shit... shit, shit.

576
01:00:46,769 --> 01:00:48,270
Just do it! We don't have much time!

577
01:00:48,354 --> 01:00:50,856
Paz, please. Elena Somebody...

578
01:00:50,981 --> 01:00:52,274
...just fuckin' do it!

579
01:00:52,358 --> 01:00:53,859
Do it!

580
01:00:53,984 --> 01:00:55,069
Do it!

581
01:01:13,962 --> 01:01:16,090
We need the fire department,
right now.

582
01:01:23,806 --> 01:01:25,015
Fuck!

583
01:01:28,769 --> 01:01:30,479
It's working. It's working.

584
01:01:31,146 --> 01:01:32,731
Hurry, hurry, hurry.

585
01:01:37,111 --> 01:01:38,278
Let me reset it.

586
01:01:39,071 --> 01:01:40,072
Give me your arm.

587
01:01:40,155 --> 01:01:40,989
Ready?

588
01:01:41,115 --> 01:01:42,991
- Oh, fuck!
- We can't stay here.

589
01:01:43,283 --> 01:01:44,201
We gotta go.

590
01:01:44,284 --> 01:01:46,829
- You guys get... you guys go.
- We gotta go! Come on! Come on.

591
01:01:48,080 --> 01:01:51,125
All right, you're good.
Come on... let's go. Careful, careful.

592
01:01:58,716 --> 01:01:59,556
Drop down two floors.

593
01:01:59,758 --> 01:02:01,468
Don't look down. Cut the rope.

594
01:02:01,760 --> 01:02:03,095
Don't go all the way.

595
01:02:05,305 --> 01:02:07,057
- Got it?
- Yeah, go.

596
01:02:09,226 --> 01:02:10,436
Shit.

597
01:02:31,248 --> 01:02:32,416
Keep movin'.

598
01:02:37,171 --> 01:02:38,130
This way.

599
01:02:40,299 --> 01:02:42,342
Oh, my God. What...

600
01:02:57,316 --> 01:02:58,484
No!

601
01:04:27,364 --> 01:04:28,866
No!

602
01:04:32,578 --> 01:04:34,913
Get up, Arkin. Get up.

603
01:05:06,153 --> 01:05:07,446
Help us!

604
01:05:09,114 --> 01:05:11,491
Help! We're in here!

605
01:05:12,492 --> 01:05:14,036
We got people in there.

606
01:05:26,381 --> 01:05:29,009
Don't die yet! Get up.

607
01:05:29,092 --> 01:05:30,677
I ain't done with you!

608
01:05:35,349 --> 01:05:36,600
Look at me.

609
01:05:37,267 --> 01:05:38,602
Look at me.

610
01:06:13,679 --> 01:06:14,554
Hurry up!

611
01:06:14,680 --> 01:06:16,390
Open it!

612
01:06:17,349 --> 01:06:18,558
Help us!

613
01:06:21,353 --> 01:06:22,562
Bring in the saws.

614
01:06:27,567 --> 01:06:29,611
Come on! Hurry!

615
01:09:19,406 --> 01:09:20,782
Chief, the coroner's
stationed the bodies

616
01:09:20,866 --> 01:09:22,367
at the south end of the parking lot.

617
01:09:22,450 --> 01:09:24,161
We're waiting for the final count.

618
01:10:43,281 --> 01:10:45,575
We haven't seen anything
like this since the late '60s

619
01:10:45,659 --> 01:10:46,910
and it was at those Bowery murders.

620
01:10:46,993 --> 01:10:48,245
- Do you remember?
- Oh, yeah.

621
01:10:48,328 --> 01:10:49,208
Her father went crazy,

622
01:10:49,287 --> 01:10:51,748
from ingesting all those
chemicals from taxidermy.

623
01:10:51,831 --> 01:10:52,999
Slaughtered his whole family

624
01:10:53,291 --> 01:10:54,834
and sat them
at the Thanksgiving table.

625
01:10:54,918 --> 01:10:57,587
Well, not the whole family.
I believe the little boy...

626
01:12:06,573 --> 01:12:10,535
All those insects
you're quite the collector.

627
01:12:11,369 --> 01:12:14,914
There are 200 mile radius from where
we last saw each other.

628
01:12:15,999 --> 01:12:19,502
There are 14 licensed entomologists

629
01:12:21,004 --> 01:12:23,381
and you were number 12.

630
01:12:24,341 --> 01:12:26,509
Your daddy ran a museum, didn't he?

631
01:12:26,634 --> 01:12:28,678
Fucked you up real good.

632
01:12:30,013 --> 01:12:31,681
Turn around.

633
01:12:40,106 --> 01:12:41,733
Turn around.

634
01:12:50,784 --> 01:12:52,369
Are you here to kill me?

635
01:12:54,913 --> 01:12:58,792
No. That'd be too nice.

636
01:13:00,460 --> 01:13:03,546
First I'm gonna make you
feel everything that I felt

637
01:13:04,422 --> 01:13:06,091
and then I'm gonna kill you.

638
01:13:06,758 --> 01:13:08,635
So that you can never hurt any...

639
01:13:13,390 --> 01:13:14,474
Fuck you!

640
01:13:14,557 --> 01:13:17,143
Fuck you! Fuck you!

641
01:13:35,412 --> 01:13:36,913
You're on his turf now.

642
01:13:44,045 --> 01:13:45,964
He didn't let me out. I got out.

643
01:13:47,006 --> 01:13:49,008
Come on! Hurry!

644
01:14:00,854 --> 01:14:02,647
Daddy! Daddy!

645
01:14:02,981 --> 01:14:04,983
She's all I have. Find her.

646
01:14:11,489 --> 01:14:13,491
What the fuck?

647
01:14:14,742 --> 01:14:16,578
I'm not leaving without her!

648
01:14:24,752 --> 01:14:25,712
Damn it!

649
01:14:26,212 --> 01:14:27,464
Stay down bitch.

650
01:14:28,089 --> 01:14:29,507
Wally!

651
01:14:40,143 --> 01:14:41,561
What the fuck!

652
01:14:50,612 --> 01:14:51,905
Don't get any ideas.

653
01:14:52,155 --> 01:14:54,282
Go now! Go!

654
01:14:59,746 --> 01:15:01,206
We're running out of time.

655
01:15:12,926 --> 01:15:14,802
You're all gonna die!

656
01:15:23,186 --> 01:15:25,647
Hey, Jeff. Can you take me
to your apartment?

657
01:15:36,157 --> 01:15:37,575
What the fuck?

658
01:15:43,540 --> 01:15:44,582
Get out of my way!
