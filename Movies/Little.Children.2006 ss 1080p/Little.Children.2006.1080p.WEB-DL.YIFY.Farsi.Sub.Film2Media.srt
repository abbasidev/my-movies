1
00:00:33,950 --> 00:00:37,386
Want to take a walk with me?

2
00:01:21,159 --> 00:01:25,228
...Continue to protest the
presence of a convicted sex offender

3
00:01:25,229 --> 00:01:28,164
in their midst.
Michelle betler reports.

4
00:01:28,165 --> 00:01:30,967
Thanks, Rick. I'm standing
here on woodward court,

5
00:01:30,968 --> 00:01:32,735
the quiet residential street

6
00:01:32,736 --> 00:01:34,704
that has become
the focus of controversy

7
00:01:34,705 --> 00:01:38,140
ever since 48-year-old Ronald
James mcgorvey returned here

8
00:01:38,141 --> 00:01:40,009
after serving a two-year
prison sentence

9
00:01:40,010 --> 00:01:42,044
for indecent exposure
to a minor.

10
00:01:42,045 --> 00:01:44,113
In the past few days
an organization

11
00:01:44,114 --> 00:01:46,048
known as the Committee
of Concerned Parents

12
00:01:46,049 --> 00:01:49,383
began distributing these notices
throughout the community

13
00:01:49,384 --> 00:01:51,786
warning neighbors
of what they call a quote,

14
00:01:51,787 --> 00:01:53,621
"dangerous predator
in our midst."

15
00:01:53,622 --> 00:01:57,258
I don't really like having
him that close to my family.

16
00:01:57,259 --> 00:02:00,794
I think it's outrageous.
This block has too many children

17
00:02:00,795 --> 00:02:03,997
for a sex offender to, uh, be
moving in the neighborhood.

18
00:02:03,998 --> 00:02:05,698
I... I don't think
it's a good idea.

19
00:02:05,699 --> 00:02:08,301
Makes me very nervous.
Makes me a little enraged.

20
00:02:08,302 --> 00:02:11,303
Um, I'd have a problem
if I see him on the street.

21
00:02:11,304 --> 00:02:13,539
It's like having an
alcoholic work in a bar.

22
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:15,842
They don't mix.
They shouldn't be together.

23
00:02:15,843 --> 00:02:19,211
The conditions of his
parole expressly forbid mcgorvey

24
00:02:19,212 --> 00:02:21,347
to be within 100 yards
of any playground,

25
00:02:21,348 --> 00:02:25,083
school or recreation area
where children normally gather.

26
00:02:25,084 --> 00:02:27,152
These conditions seem
to be of little comfort

27
00:02:27,153 --> 00:02:29,888
to the many parents whose
children play and go to school

28
00:02:29,889 --> 00:02:31,756
in this formerly
tranquil community,

29
00:02:31,757 --> 00:02:35,092
and who in the coming days and
weeks will be hoping for the best

30
00:02:35,093 --> 00:02:38,163
but preparing for the worst.
Rick, back to you.

31
00:02:47,604 --> 00:02:51,875
My husband and I had an
actual spiritual experience.

32
00:02:51,876 --> 00:02:55,078
We did this intense
spa treatment...

33
00:02:55,079 --> 00:02:56,945
- Oh, come on.
- No, listen to me.

34
00:02:56,946 --> 00:03:00,182
It was on our vacation in cabo and
there were eight other couples

35
00:03:00,183 --> 00:03:02,350
and this Mayan woman.

36
00:03:02,351 --> 00:03:04,452
A goddess, just a goddess.

37
00:03:04,453 --> 00:03:06,021
- She had...
- She's due in September.

38
00:03:06,022 --> 00:03:08,489
She thinks she's gonna
take three months off,

39
00:03:08,490 --> 00:03:11,425
then it's Christmas, then she'll be
back to work the first of the year.

40
00:03:11,426 --> 00:03:12,860
Please.

41
00:03:12,861 --> 00:03:15,729
Six months from now she'll be
right here on this bench with us.

42
00:03:15,730 --> 00:03:17,831
My friend Beth said
that the way she did it

43
00:03:17,832 --> 00:03:20,967
was to just take him with her every
time she went to the bathroom.

44
00:03:20,968 --> 00:03:24,437
- I find that strange.
- Yeah, that's what I said to Beth.

45
00:03:24,438 --> 00:03:25,838
It's oedipal.

46
00:03:25,839 --> 00:03:27,640
What's the rush?

47
00:03:27,641 --> 00:03:30,910
Although I will say, when I was
trying to potty-train Christian,

48
00:03:30,911 --> 00:03:33,712
I opened the diaper
and it was huge!

49
00:03:33,713 --> 00:03:35,780
Like a grown man.

50
00:03:35,781 --> 00:03:38,951
Smiling politely to mask
a familiar feeling of desperation,

51
00:03:38,952 --> 00:03:42,921
Sarah reminded herself to think
like an anthropologist.

52
00:03:42,922 --> 00:03:47,158
She was a researcher studying the
behavior of typical suburban women.

53
00:03:47,159 --> 00:03:48,893
They weren't organic?

54
00:03:48,894 --> 00:03:51,862
She was not a typical
suburban woman herself.

55
00:03:51,863 --> 00:03:54,097
Troy, stop that!

56
00:03:54,098 --> 00:03:55,498
Paul and I were having
sex the other night

57
00:03:55,499 --> 00:03:57,834
and I drifted off
right in the middle of it.

58
00:03:57,835 --> 00:03:59,536
It happens.

59
00:03:59,537 --> 00:04:02,872
Yeah, I guess. But when I
woke up and apologized

60
00:04:02,873 --> 00:04:04,740
he said he hadn't even noticed.

61
00:04:04,741 --> 00:04:06,375
You know what you should do?

62
00:04:06,376 --> 00:04:09,145
Set aside a specific
block of time for it.

63
00:04:09,146 --> 00:04:11,813
That's what Louis and I do...
Every Tuesday night at 9:00.

64
00:04:11,814 --> 00:04:13,849
"Whether you want
to or not" Sarah thought,

65
00:04:13,850 --> 00:04:16,518
her eyes straying over
to the play area.

66
00:04:17,786 --> 00:04:20,621
Even at such a tiny
playground as this,

67
00:04:20,622 --> 00:04:23,824
Lucy didn't interact much
with the other children.

68
00:04:23,825 --> 00:04:26,427
Sarah didn't really know why
they even bothered coming here,

69
00:04:26,428 --> 00:04:28,528
except that she'd
probably go crazy

70
00:04:28,529 --> 00:04:30,330
trapped in the house all day

71
00:04:30,331 --> 00:04:32,699
with this unknowable
little person.

72
00:04:39,673 --> 00:04:41,740
Morning snack time
was 10:30 on the dot...

73
00:04:41,741 --> 00:04:43,742
Snack time!

74
00:04:43,743 --> 00:04:46,512
...A regimen established
and maintained by Mary Ann,

75
00:04:46,513 --> 00:04:49,315
who believed that rigid
adherence to a timetable

76
00:04:49,316 --> 00:04:51,249
was not only the key
to a healthy marriage,

77
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:53,118
but to effective
parenting as well.

78
00:04:53,119 --> 00:04:56,222
- I'll take this one!
- I want that one!

79
00:04:58,157 --> 00:05:01,526
- Can I do it?
- Yeah. Ready?

80
00:05:04,429 --> 00:05:06,998
Mommy...

81
00:05:06,999 --> 00:05:09,033
Where's my snack?

82
00:05:09,034 --> 00:05:11,335
I'm sorry, honey,
mommy can't find it.

83
00:05:11,336 --> 00:05:13,403
- I forgot the rice cakes.
- Poor thing.

84
00:05:13,404 --> 00:05:15,671
- I'm sure it's in here somewhere.
- Second time this week.

85
00:05:15,672 --> 00:05:17,707
Well, who's going to keep
track of everything?

86
00:05:17,708 --> 00:05:20,076
- Bad mommy. Bad mommy.
- Just calm down, please.

87
00:05:20,077 --> 00:05:23,912
No calm down! I want my snack!

88
00:05:23,913 --> 00:05:26,215
All right, you know what? It's...

89
00:05:26,216 --> 00:05:29,319
It's just not here, okay?
See for yourself.

90
00:05:32,622 --> 00:05:34,189
Wait!

91
00:05:34,190 --> 00:05:37,358
Troy, honey,
give Lucy your goldfish.

92
00:05:37,359 --> 00:05:38,993
No!

93
00:05:38,994 --> 00:05:40,828
Troy Jonathan,
give me those goldfish!

94
00:05:40,829 --> 00:05:42,363
But, mama, they're mine.

95
00:05:42,364 --> 00:05:44,698
No back talk. You can
share with your sister.

96
00:05:44,699 --> 00:05:47,100
Troy has goldfish for you.
Go sit down.

97
00:05:47,101 --> 00:05:49,236
That's much more than 10.

98
00:05:49,237 --> 00:05:51,638
- That's great.
- Look how big I made my lawn.

99
00:05:51,639 --> 00:05:54,274
Thank you, Mary Ann,
you're a lifesaver.

100
00:05:54,275 --> 00:05:57,710
It's nothing. I just hate to
see her suffer like that.

101
00:05:59,079 --> 00:06:01,780
Maybe you should make a checklist
and tape it to the door

102
00:06:01,781 --> 00:06:04,583
so it's the last thing you
see before leaving the house.

103
00:06:04,584 --> 00:06:06,518
That's what I do.

104
00:06:06,519 --> 00:06:10,388
Yeah, thank you. That's... that's
a really helpful suggestion.

105
00:06:10,389 --> 00:06:13,724
You're welcome.

106
00:06:13,725 --> 00:06:15,893
Drink your juice.

107
00:06:15,894 --> 00:06:17,795
Are you the plane again?

108
00:06:17,796 --> 00:06:19,064
Look.

109
00:06:19,065 --> 00:06:21,665
Now you have to act like me.

110
00:06:21,666 --> 00:06:24,000
The prom king.

111
00:06:24,001 --> 00:06:27,504
Oh my god, he's back.

112
00:06:27,505 --> 00:06:29,373
Sarah followed
the other women's gazes

113
00:06:29,374 --> 00:06:30,974
over to the entrance
of the playground,

114
00:06:30,975 --> 00:06:33,942
eager to finally get a glimpse
of the prom king,

115
00:06:33,943 --> 00:06:36,579
the handsome and mysterious
young father

116
00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:38,781
who had been a regular
at the Walker street playground

117
00:06:38,782 --> 00:06:41,550
for several weeks
this past spring

118
00:06:41,551 --> 00:06:44,619
before abruptly
dropping out of sight.

119
00:06:44,620 --> 00:06:48,223
I don't need a rest.
I need an airplane ride.

120
00:06:48,224 --> 00:06:51,493
His departure had left a
gaping hole in the emotional lives

121
00:06:51,494 --> 00:06:53,861
of Cheryl, Theresa and Mary Ann.

122
00:06:53,862 --> 00:06:56,963
Barely a day went by without one
of them speculating wistfully

123
00:06:56,964 --> 00:07:00,867
about the reason for his absence
and the likelihood of his return.

124
00:07:02,570 --> 00:07:07,006
Here I come. There's no
room for two of us, Diesel.

125
00:07:07,007 --> 00:07:09,375
You've done it again.

126
00:07:09,376 --> 00:07:10,910
I hate steam engines.

127
00:07:10,911 --> 00:07:14,080
When I come back I will
pinch you with my pinchers.

128
00:07:14,081 --> 00:07:17,582
Yeah? Well, when I come back

129
00:07:17,583 --> 00:07:19,351
I'm gonna ram you
with my rammer.

130
00:07:19,352 --> 00:07:21,320
- Ready?
- No, you won't.

131
00:07:23,689 --> 00:07:28,392
Every time you win, Diesel!

132
00:07:28,393 --> 00:07:30,228
I know.

133
00:07:30,229 --> 00:07:33,797
- Hello!
- Mommy's home.

134
00:07:33,798 --> 00:07:36,767
The Jester's cap was
something that truly disturbed Brad.

135
00:07:36,768 --> 00:07:40,036
All day long the boy ate,
played and napped in it.

136
00:07:40,037 --> 00:07:44,073
But the moment his mother stepped in
the house he had no more use for it.

137
00:07:44,074 --> 00:07:46,609
As if the entire day up to that point

138
00:07:46,610 --> 00:07:49,612
had been a pointless
and somewhat useless charade.

139
00:07:49,613 --> 00:07:51,947
You got some sun
today, didn't you?

140
00:07:51,948 --> 00:07:54,550
Did daddy forget
the sunscreen again?

141
00:07:54,551 --> 00:07:58,954
What are you doing?

142
00:07:58,955 --> 00:08:02,757
That's his full name. What's
your favorite thing about him?

143
00:08:02,758 --> 00:08:05,193
Um...

144
00:08:05,194 --> 00:08:07,695
I like to come over
to his house.

145
00:08:07,696 --> 00:08:09,265
Hmm.

146
00:08:11,867 --> 00:08:15,469
I think I'm gonna finally break
down and get a cell phone.

147
00:08:15,470 --> 00:08:17,837
- Really?
- Mmm.

148
00:08:17,838 --> 00:08:19,374
Why?

149
00:08:22,477 --> 00:08:24,578
I have no way of reaching you
when I'm out with Aaron.

150
00:08:24,579 --> 00:08:26,246
You're done, right?

151
00:08:28,248 --> 00:08:30,383
You got one.

152
00:08:30,384 --> 00:08:32,151
Don't you think it's
strange that I don't?

153
00:08:32,152 --> 00:08:36,255
Yeah, I do. You just
never wanted one before.

154
00:08:36,256 --> 00:08:38,523
Yeah, I know.

155
00:08:38,524 --> 00:08:42,395
There's a family plan.
We can talk for free.

156
00:08:44,129 --> 00:08:45,797
Okay.

157
00:08:45,798 --> 00:08:48,699
Let's just see where we are
at the end of the month.

158
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:52,203
Yeah?

159
00:08:52,204 --> 00:08:53,571
Are your hands okay?

160
00:09:08,352 --> 00:09:10,819
As was her custom
each week night after dinner,

161
00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:14,289
the boy's mother sent Brad
down to the municipal library

162
00:09:14,290 --> 00:09:17,226
to study for the bar exam.

163
00:09:17,227 --> 00:09:20,895
But he never quite made it through
the door of the building.

164
00:09:23,298 --> 00:09:26,934
Brad had been watching the
skateboarders for weeks now,

165
00:09:26,935 --> 00:09:29,370
sometimes for as long
as an hour at a stretch.

166
00:09:29,371 --> 00:09:32,940
But he never received the slightest
acknowledgement from any of them.

167
00:09:34,642 --> 00:09:38,411
He'd been the same age as these
boys when his mother died.

168
00:09:38,412 --> 00:09:40,513
- You do that!
- No way!

169
00:09:40,514 --> 00:09:42,415
- Nice.
- Hey, that was nice, dude!

170
00:09:42,416 --> 00:09:45,451
"I must have been like
this," Brad sometimes thought.

171
00:09:45,452 --> 00:09:49,856
"I must have been one of them."

172
00:09:53,226 --> 00:09:54,727
Awful.

173
00:09:56,462 --> 00:09:58,763
He should be castrated.

174
00:09:58,764 --> 00:10:00,598
Quick and clean,
just chop it off.

175
00:10:00,599 --> 00:10:03,033
Then you wouldn't have to worry
about notifying the neighbors.

176
00:10:03,034 --> 00:10:04,735
You know what else
you should do?

177
00:10:04,736 --> 00:10:07,304
Nail his penis above the entrance
to the elementary school.

178
00:10:07,305 --> 00:10:10,607
You know, as a warning to other perverts.

179
00:10:10,608 --> 00:10:12,342
You think this is funny?

180
00:10:12,343 --> 00:10:16,179
I just can't believe you want to
castrate a man for indecent exposure.

181
00:10:16,180 --> 00:10:18,881
My brother used
to expose himself when...

182
00:10:18,882 --> 00:10:21,250
When we were teenagers.
He'd do it in my bedroom,

183
00:10:21,251 --> 00:10:23,919
he'd do it in the dining room, he'd
do it in the back seat of a car.

184
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:27,490
He'd always figure out a way to do it
so that nobody could see him except me.

185
00:10:27,491 --> 00:10:29,692
Didn't you tell anyone?

186
00:10:29,693 --> 00:10:31,693
No, I didn't want
to get him in trouble.

187
00:10:31,694 --> 00:10:33,628
Maybe he should be castrated.

188
00:10:35,498 --> 00:10:38,400
It's not the same thing. He
wasn't doing it to strangers.

189
00:10:38,401 --> 00:10:41,035
Oh my god, there he is.

190
00:10:41,036 --> 00:10:43,970
After all this time,
two days in a row.

191
00:10:43,971 --> 00:10:45,406
Where's the fire?

192
00:10:45,407 --> 00:10:48,174
Maybe he needed a vacation.

193
00:10:48,175 --> 00:10:50,544
From what?

194
00:10:50,545 --> 00:10:52,712
From being the prom king.

195
00:10:52,713 --> 00:10:55,247
It's a dirty job, but
someone's gotta do it.

196
00:10:58,785 --> 00:11:00,953
- Close it?
- Close it.

197
00:11:00,954 --> 00:11:04,389
Close the gate. There you go.

198
00:11:04,390 --> 00:11:06,891
- It's open.
- It's all right.

199
00:11:06,892 --> 00:11:10,396
- Somebody else will close it.
- Are we practicing?

200
00:11:12,164 --> 00:11:15,166
Are we playing up on the swings?

201
00:11:15,167 --> 00:11:17,436
Swing time!

202
00:11:22,173 --> 00:11:23,874
What's he do for a living?

203
00:11:23,875 --> 00:11:27,877
We've never actually
spoken to him.

204
00:11:27,878 --> 00:11:29,078
Really?

205
00:11:29,079 --> 00:11:31,548
We don't even know his name.

206
00:11:31,549 --> 00:11:34,684
I thought you guys said
he was a regular here.

207
00:11:34,685 --> 00:11:36,919
- It was awkward.
- He made us nervous.

208
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:40,088
You had to think about what you
were gonna wear in the morning.

209
00:11:40,089 --> 00:11:43,058
You know, put on makeup.
It was exhausting.

210
00:11:52,267 --> 00:11:54,569
Mommy, push me!

211
00:11:54,570 --> 00:11:58,507
Okay. I'll be right there.

212
00:12:01,642 --> 00:12:02,977
Wait!

213
00:12:04,779 --> 00:12:07,180
Five bucks if you get
his phone number.

214
00:12:15,121 --> 00:12:16,655
How old is she?

215
00:12:16,656 --> 00:12:17,856
Lucy,

216
00:12:17,857 --> 00:12:20,993
tell the nice boy
how old you are.

217
00:12:20,994 --> 00:12:23,362
I'm three.

218
00:12:23,363 --> 00:12:25,630
My grandma lives in New Jersey.

219
00:12:25,631 --> 00:12:28,933
She doesn't have a swim pool.

220
00:12:28,934 --> 00:12:30,402
Do you like to swim?

221
00:12:30,403 --> 00:12:33,705
I don't like sharks.
They eat you up.

222
00:12:33,706 --> 00:12:35,739
Don't listen to him.

223
00:12:35,740 --> 00:12:39,242
We go to the town pool
almost every day.

224
00:12:39,243 --> 00:12:42,746
- I'm Brad, by the way.
- Sarah.

225
00:12:42,747 --> 00:12:45,215
You guys come here a lot?

226
00:12:45,216 --> 00:12:47,750
No, just the last few weeks.

227
00:12:47,751 --> 00:12:49,985
I usually go to the one
over on Harris,

228
00:12:49,986 --> 00:12:52,287
with the big wood things,
you know, and the slide across.

229
00:12:52,288 --> 00:12:55,425
Yeah, we actually rent a house right
around the corner from there on ashforth.

230
00:12:55,426 --> 00:12:58,660
That ice cream truck never leaves.
Such a nightmare.

231
00:12:58,661 --> 00:13:02,230
Yeah, tell me about it.

232
00:13:02,231 --> 00:13:05,435
You know, you're the first person
here who's ever talked to me.

233
00:13:07,136 --> 00:13:10,370
You make 'em nervous.

234
00:13:10,371 --> 00:13:12,706
Oh, right.

235
00:13:12,707 --> 00:13:16,578
I guess they don't see too many
fathers here during the weekdays.

236
00:13:19,681 --> 00:13:22,014
You don't have to be polite.
Go ahead and ask.

237
00:13:22,015 --> 00:13:23,916
What?

238
00:13:23,917 --> 00:13:26,919
You know, what the person who wears the
pants in the family does for a living.

239
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:30,457
Oh. All right,
what does your wife do?

240
00:13:30,458 --> 00:13:33,825
- She makes documentaries.
- Oh, wow.

241
00:13:33,826 --> 00:13:36,995
- Like Michael Moore?
- Uh, like pbs.

242
00:13:36,996 --> 00:13:39,498
Oh.

243
00:13:39,499 --> 00:13:41,332
Well, I think it's
admirable you're here.

244
00:13:41,333 --> 00:13:44,603
There's no reason fathers
can't be primary caregivers.

245
00:13:46,838 --> 00:13:48,606
I finished law school
two years ago,

246
00:13:48,607 --> 00:13:52,276
but I can't seem to pass the bar exam.
Failed it twice now.

247
00:13:53,945 --> 00:13:57,047
Maybe you just don't
want to be a lawyer.

248
00:13:59,617 --> 00:14:01,551
I'll take the test
one more time.

249
00:14:01,552 --> 00:14:03,319
If I mess up now

250
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:07,456
I'll just have to find something
else to do with my life.

251
00:14:07,457 --> 00:14:09,758
- Right, buddy?
- Right.

252
00:14:09,759 --> 00:14:12,995
Sarah was shocked by how
Brad delivered this confession,

253
00:14:12,996 --> 00:14:16,998
with no apparent sense of being in the
least bit embarrassed by his failure.

254
00:14:16,999 --> 00:14:19,767
Most men weren't like this.

255
00:14:19,768 --> 00:14:22,737
Her husband Richard
certainly wasn't.

256
00:14:22,738 --> 00:14:25,339
She wondered if Brad was
always this forthcoming.

257
00:14:25,340 --> 00:14:28,042
If anything,
he seemed a little lonely,

258
00:14:28,043 --> 00:14:31,945
all too ready to open his heart at
the slightest sign of interest,

259
00:14:31,946 --> 00:14:34,615
like a lot of young
mothers she knew.

260
00:14:34,616 --> 00:14:37,350
I couldn't help noticing
your stroller.

261
00:14:37,351 --> 00:14:39,586
Do you have another child?

262
00:14:39,587 --> 00:14:42,287
No, just Aaron.
Got that at a yard sale.

263
00:14:42,288 --> 00:14:45,858
Extra seat comes in handy
for the bear, though.

264
00:14:45,859 --> 00:14:48,994
Lucy refuses to go
in a stroller or a car seat.

265
00:14:48,995 --> 00:14:52,564
We have to walk everywhere. It takes
us half an hour to go three blocks,

266
00:14:52,565 --> 00:14:54,365
unless I carry her.

267
00:14:54,366 --> 00:14:58,202
- Daddy, I'm finished.
- Are you sure? We just got here.

268
00:14:58,203 --> 00:15:00,672
I'm finished right now.

269
00:15:00,673 --> 00:15:03,440
Okay. All right, here we go.

270
00:15:03,441 --> 00:15:06,510
Ready? One, two, three.

271
00:15:06,511 --> 00:15:08,145
- Oops.
- Oh, hold on for a second.

272
00:15:08,146 --> 00:15:09,647
- There, thank you.
- Are you okay?

273
00:15:09,648 --> 00:15:11,615
No problem.

274
00:15:11,616 --> 00:15:14,517
It was then while watching
Brad kneel down at his son's feet

275
00:15:14,518 --> 00:15:19,589
that Sarah found herself gripped
by an unexpected pang of sadness.

276
00:15:19,590 --> 00:15:22,424
"Don't go," she thought.

277
00:15:22,425 --> 00:15:24,795
"Don't leave me here
with the others."

278
00:15:26,696 --> 00:15:30,331
- It was nice talking to you.
- Same here.

279
00:15:30,332 --> 00:15:33,501
Wait! Um...

280
00:15:33,502 --> 00:15:35,503
come here. Just...

281
00:15:35,504 --> 00:15:39,674
Come here.

282
00:15:39,675 --> 00:15:41,709
You see those women over there?

283
00:15:41,710 --> 00:15:43,811
Just, yeah, don't... Don't look.

284
00:15:43,812 --> 00:15:46,981
You know what they call you?

285
00:15:46,982 --> 00:15:48,281
What?

286
00:15:48,282 --> 00:15:50,550
The prom king.

287
00:15:50,551 --> 00:15:52,118
Oh god, really?

288
00:15:52,119 --> 00:15:54,754
Yeah, they mean it
as a compliment.

289
00:15:54,755 --> 00:15:57,323
You're a big character
in their fantasy lives.

290
00:15:57,324 --> 00:15:58,925
Wow.

291
00:15:58,926 --> 00:16:02,027
Um, so one of them bet me $5 I
couldn't get your phone number.

292
00:16:02,028 --> 00:16:04,863
Five bucks, huh?

293
00:16:04,864 --> 00:16:06,799
Yeah.

294
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:09,367
Could we split it 50-50?

295
00:16:09,368 --> 00:16:11,235
It could be arranged.

296
00:16:11,236 --> 00:16:12,937
It doesn't have to be
your real number.

297
00:16:12,938 --> 00:16:15,573
Oh, well, you know, in that case, sure.
You got a pen?

298
00:16:15,574 --> 00:16:18,810
Great. Oh shit, no
I... um, no I don't.

299
00:16:18,811 --> 00:16:20,812
- Uh...
- well...

300
00:16:20,813 --> 00:16:22,879
No wait, just... Wait.

301
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:26,349
You know what'd really be funny?

302
00:16:26,350 --> 00:16:29,219
If you gave me a hug.

303
00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:32,689
- You think?
- Yeah.

304
00:16:32,690 --> 00:16:35,090
- Yeah.
- All right, come here.

305
00:16:35,091 --> 00:16:38,895
Oh my god.

306
00:16:40,130 --> 00:16:43,599
Do you want to really
freak them out?

307
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:44,966
Yeah.

308
00:16:44,967 --> 00:16:47,169
Who's gonna talk in there?

309
00:16:49,004 --> 00:16:50,338
- Oh my god!
- Troy!

310
00:16:50,339 --> 00:16:51,840
- Lucy!
- Isabelle!

311
00:16:51,841 --> 00:16:54,676
Isabelle! Come here, Isabelle.
Okay, we have to go.

312
00:16:54,677 --> 00:16:56,376
- Isabelle!
- Troy!

313
00:16:56,377 --> 00:16:59,512
- I think that worked.
- Yeah, I think so.

314
00:16:59,513 --> 00:17:03,250
- Um, well, it was nice meeting you.
- Yeah.

315
00:17:03,251 --> 00:17:05,886
It's okay, yeah. We're gonna go.

316
00:17:05,887 --> 00:17:08,220
- It's all right.
- Lucy?

317
00:17:08,221 --> 00:17:09,989
We're gonna go home.

318
00:17:09,990 --> 00:17:12,591
Okay, here we go, good girl.

319
00:17:12,592 --> 00:17:14,662
Good girl.

320
00:17:16,730 --> 00:17:19,164
I'm sure your daughter
found that very educational.

321
00:17:19,165 --> 00:17:20,766
His name is Brad. He's a lawyer

322
00:17:20,767 --> 00:17:23,736
and he's really very nice.

323
00:17:27,206 --> 00:17:29,407
For the past few
days Sarah hadn't been able

324
00:17:29,408 --> 00:17:32,142
to concentrate on anything
but the prom king

325
00:17:32,143 --> 00:17:34,244
and the curious thing
that had happened

326
00:17:34,245 --> 00:17:36,381
between them on the playground.

327
00:17:37,749 --> 00:17:40,284
She didn't feel shame or guilt,

328
00:17:40,285 --> 00:17:43,953
only a sense of profound
disorientation,

329
00:17:43,954 --> 00:17:46,155
as if she had been
kidnapped by aliens

330
00:17:46,156 --> 00:17:49,860
then released unharmed
a few hours later.

331
00:18:06,174 --> 00:18:08,442
As he had so often
in recent days,

332
00:18:08,443 --> 00:18:12,313
Brad mentally reenacted
the kiss by the swing set.

333
00:18:12,314 --> 00:18:14,716
He still couldn't believe
it had really happened.

334
00:18:14,717 --> 00:18:17,784
- And with all those women and children watching.
- Troy! Troy!

335
00:18:17,785 --> 00:18:21,054
Aaron had been particularly
curious about what he'd seen.

336
00:18:21,055 --> 00:18:22,723
Why you hugging that lady?

337
00:18:22,724 --> 00:18:25,158
Well, that's what I'm trying
to show you with bozo.

338
00:18:25,159 --> 00:18:28,994
Sometimes it's a game that adults
play to show that they're friends.

339
00:18:28,995 --> 00:18:31,296
You say, "hi, I'm your friend."

340
00:18:31,297 --> 00:18:33,132
Aaron was skeptical.

341
00:18:33,133 --> 00:18:35,634
They returned to the playground
the following morning,

342
00:18:35,635 --> 00:18:38,336
but no one was there.

343
00:18:38,337 --> 00:18:41,072
Sarah hadn't shown up
at the town pool either,

344
00:18:41,073 --> 00:18:43,174
though Brad remembered telling
her that he and Aaron

345
00:18:43,175 --> 00:18:45,609
could be found there
most afternoons.

346
00:18:45,610 --> 00:18:48,713
It didn't seem to matter
that Sarah wasn't his type,

347
00:18:48,714 --> 00:18:52,983
wasn't even that pretty...
At least not compared to Kathy,

348
00:18:52,984 --> 00:18:57,687
who had long legs
and lustrous hair

349
00:18:57,688 --> 00:18:59,923
and perfect breasts.

350
00:18:59,924 --> 00:19:03,392
Sarah was short, boyish,

351
00:19:03,393 --> 00:19:06,764
and had eyebrows that were thicker
than Brad thought necessary.

352
00:19:08,165 --> 00:19:12,467
But even so, she'd walked
into his arms that day

353
00:19:12,468 --> 00:19:14,870
as if she were fulfilling
a secret wish

354
00:19:14,871 --> 00:19:16,973
he hadn't remembered making.

355
00:19:18,775 --> 00:19:20,809
Hey, pervert!

356
00:19:20,810 --> 00:19:22,844
Yeah, you, you pervert!

357
00:19:22,845 --> 00:19:25,312
You like little boys, do ya?

358
00:19:25,313 --> 00:19:28,015
- Larry?
- Yes, it's fucking Larry!

359
00:19:28,016 --> 00:19:29,884
Jesus, man, don't
even joke about that.

360
00:19:29,885 --> 00:19:31,752
What are you doing?
Are you busy?

361
00:19:31,753 --> 00:19:36,055
Uh, actually I'm
supposed to be studying.

362
00:19:36,056 --> 00:19:38,391
Taking the bar exam next month.

363
00:19:38,392 --> 00:19:40,860
I thought you
did that last year.

364
00:19:40,861 --> 00:19:43,763
Yeah. See how well I did?

365
00:19:43,764 --> 00:19:47,833
I got a better idea. Get in.

366
00:19:47,834 --> 00:19:51,070
Come on. Come on, come on,
come on, come on, come on.

367
00:19:52,806 --> 00:19:56,174
Do you mind holding these?
Try to keep them nice.

368
00:19:56,175 --> 00:19:58,876
Oh, uh...

369
00:19:58,877 --> 00:20:03,215
Are you, uh, part
of the committee?

370
00:20:04,616 --> 00:20:06,518
I am the committee.

371
00:20:08,253 --> 00:20:10,854
Wow.

372
00:20:10,855 --> 00:20:12,823
That's... that's
quite a commitment.

373
00:20:12,824 --> 00:20:15,358
Yeah.

374
00:20:15,359 --> 00:20:17,962
Aren't you full-time
on the force already?

375
00:20:20,031 --> 00:20:22,532
Yeah, I'm... I'm taking
a little time off.

376
00:20:27,103 --> 00:20:30,940
You know what they should
do to this bastard?

377
00:20:30,941 --> 00:20:33,341
Just castrate him.
You know, pfft!

378
00:20:33,342 --> 00:20:37,311
Get it over with, right?

379
00:20:37,312 --> 00:20:38,814
Yeah.

380
00:20:48,322 --> 00:20:49,858
You look good.

381
00:20:51,659 --> 00:20:54,827
You've been, uh, working out?

382
00:20:54,828 --> 00:20:58,530
Uh, just push-ups, crunches...

383
00:20:58,531 --> 00:21:00,233
A little light running.

384
00:21:02,802 --> 00:21:05,005
The guys are gonna love this.

385
00:21:06,939 --> 00:21:08,440
What guys?

386
00:21:10,209 --> 00:21:13,578
Wow, this is something.

387
00:21:13,579 --> 00:21:16,814
Yeah, it's pretty, but
doesn't have a lot of give.

388
00:21:16,815 --> 00:21:18,182
It's like playing on cement.

389
00:21:18,183 --> 00:21:19,917
Hey, hold on a second.

390
00:21:19,918 --> 00:21:22,152
Duane, I've really gotta talk
to you about the committee.

391
00:21:22,153 --> 00:21:24,588
I mean, it would mean a lot to
have your support on this thing.

392
00:21:24,589 --> 00:21:27,824
I told you already, Larry, none of us
are gonna get involved in that shit.

393
00:21:27,825 --> 00:21:31,460
We're here to play ball. If that's your
thing, fine, but leave us out of it.

394
00:21:31,461 --> 00:21:33,829
Okay okay, fine. I get it,
I get it, I get it. Guys!

395
00:21:33,830 --> 00:21:36,900
Bring it in!

396
00:21:36,901 --> 00:21:39,935
Come on, come on, hustle up!

397
00:21:39,936 --> 00:21:43,538
I want you all to meet
our new quarterback.

398
00:21:43,539 --> 00:21:46,741
- Quarterback?
- Guy better not be a pussy.

399
00:21:46,742 --> 00:21:48,210
He played in college.

400
00:21:48,211 --> 00:21:50,445
Uh, I'm a little
behind the curve.

401
00:21:50,446 --> 00:21:52,146
Who are you guys?

402
00:21:52,147 --> 00:21:53,847
- We're the guardians!
- We're cops.

403
00:21:53,848 --> 00:21:56,017
Welcome to the tri-county
touch football night league.

404
00:21:56,018 --> 00:21:59,154
Let's just work on some
simple pass patterns.

405
00:22:01,356 --> 00:22:04,124
Brad waited for
his good sense to kick in.

406
00:22:04,125 --> 00:22:07,060
There were lots of excuses
available to him.

407
00:22:07,061 --> 00:22:10,796
But it felt so good to be standing
here beneath the bright lights.

408
00:22:10,797 --> 00:22:13,433
And he was filled with a
feeling similar to the one

409
00:22:13,434 --> 00:22:15,600
he'd had right
before kissing Sarah,

410
00:22:15,601 --> 00:22:17,636
like his world had cracked open

411
00:22:17,637 --> 00:22:21,341
to reveal a thrilling
new possibility.

412
00:22:22,408 --> 00:22:25,509
Okay, just let me
warm up a little.

413
00:22:25,510 --> 00:22:27,878
All right! Let's go!

414
00:22:27,879 --> 00:22:30,614
Set, hut!

415
00:22:36,021 --> 00:22:37,787
What the fuck?

416
00:22:37,788 --> 00:22:39,622
That's a late hit!

417
00:22:39,623 --> 00:22:41,559
This ain't pop Warner, Ace.

418
00:22:43,494 --> 00:22:48,231
You fucking faggot. You call
yourself a quarterback?

419
00:23:00,142 --> 00:23:02,344
Oh, this isn't me.

420
00:23:04,646 --> 00:23:06,914
What are you doing?

421
00:23:06,915 --> 00:23:10,551
What is that? What's that for?

422
00:23:10,552 --> 00:23:13,488
I want the scumbag to know
I'm keeping an eye on him.

423
00:23:18,926 --> 00:23:22,161
Oh, shit. Oh, uh...

424
00:23:22,162 --> 00:23:25,198
I don't think we want
to be here, Larry.

425
00:23:25,199 --> 00:23:28,402
It's not a question of want.

426
00:23:31,738 --> 00:23:34,139
Joanie thinks I'm
obsessed with this creep.

427
00:23:34,140 --> 00:23:37,542
She thinks if I had a job, I wouldn't be
driving past his house five, six times a day.

428
00:23:37,543 --> 00:23:39,944
But you know what?

429
00:23:39,945 --> 00:23:43,148
I kinda think this is my job.

430
00:23:45,517 --> 00:23:48,419
There's a roll of duct tape
in the glove compartment.

431
00:23:48,420 --> 00:23:51,989
Would you grab it for me?

432
00:23:59,363 --> 00:24:02,099
Honey?

433
00:24:04,635 --> 00:24:07,769
Hi!

434
00:24:07,770 --> 00:24:10,506
Where were you?

435
00:24:12,708 --> 00:24:14,376
Oh my god. What happened?

436
00:24:14,377 --> 00:24:17,012
I... I... I joined this group.

437
00:24:17,013 --> 00:24:18,979
The committee
for concerned parents.

438
00:24:18,980 --> 00:24:22,016
We're distributing flyers about
that creep on woodward court.

439
00:24:22,017 --> 00:24:25,120
These guys play a little
touch football after.

440
00:24:26,688 --> 00:24:28,156
This late?

441
00:24:28,157 --> 00:24:30,923
Uh, it's a night league.

442
00:24:30,924 --> 00:24:34,894
So it's gonna
be a regular thing?

443
00:24:34,895 --> 00:24:36,529
No no no no, just once a week,

444
00:24:36,530 --> 00:24:39,866
after I'm done
studying at the library.

445
00:24:39,867 --> 00:24:41,667
Is that okay?

446
00:24:41,668 --> 00:24:44,436
Uh, who are the guys?

447
00:24:44,437 --> 00:24:46,538
You remember Larry hedges?

448
00:24:46,539 --> 00:24:48,774
The guy from the sprinkler
park with the twins?

449
00:24:48,775 --> 00:24:52,010
It's his organization.

450
00:24:52,011 --> 00:24:54,246
I thought you didn't like him.

451
00:24:55,881 --> 00:24:57,748
He's okay.

452
00:24:57,749 --> 00:25:01,186
This committee makes a
lot of sense. I mean it's...

453
00:25:01,187 --> 00:25:03,421
It's pretty scary having
a weirdo like that

454
00:25:03,422 --> 00:25:05,790
living right by the playground.

455
00:25:07,925 --> 00:25:11,128
Mmm. I know.

456
00:25:11,129 --> 00:25:13,264
I hate to even think about it.

457
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:18,367
Guess you'd better
take a shower.

458
00:25:18,368 --> 00:25:21,504
Brad showered quickly,
sensing a rare opportunity

459
00:25:21,505 --> 00:25:24,607
to have sex with his wife.

460
00:25:24,608 --> 00:25:26,742
"This is just what I need,"
he thought.

461
00:25:26,743 --> 00:25:30,112
"Something to take
my mind off that kiss."

462
00:25:30,113 --> 00:25:32,280
Please don't.

463
00:25:32,281 --> 00:25:34,082
Come on, Kathy, we've
been through this before.

464
00:25:34,083 --> 00:25:35,783
He needs to start
sleeping by himself.

465
00:25:35,784 --> 00:25:37,519
I know. He looks so comfy.

466
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:39,320
Well, he'll be just
as comfy in his own bed.

467
00:25:39,321 --> 00:25:41,688
I just miss him so much.

468
00:25:41,689 --> 00:25:44,791
I'm getting a little tired waking
up with his foot in my face.

469
00:25:44,792 --> 00:25:47,528
It's a perfect foot.

470
00:25:47,529 --> 00:25:50,330
Look at him. Just look at him.

471
00:25:50,331 --> 00:25:53,166
He's a handsome devil.

472
00:25:53,167 --> 00:25:56,703
Mmm, he's perfect.

473
00:26:10,183 --> 00:26:11,817
Good night.

474
00:26:16,388 --> 00:26:17,921
Number 2 hillcrest

475
00:26:17,922 --> 00:26:20,258
was an impressive
piece of real estate.

476
00:26:20,259 --> 00:26:22,460
Even so, Sarah was ambivalent

477
00:26:22,461 --> 00:26:24,661
about the house she occupied.

478
00:26:24,662 --> 00:26:27,864
She wasn't involved
with its purchase or design.

479
00:26:27,865 --> 00:26:30,833
The place was a hand-me-down of
sorts from Richard's mother.

480
00:26:30,834 --> 00:26:34,537
And the furnishings were leftovers
from his first marriage.

481
00:26:34,538 --> 00:26:36,505
By the time Sarah arrived here

482
00:26:36,506 --> 00:26:39,007
Richard wasn't all that
interested in redecorating.

483
00:26:39,008 --> 00:26:42,077
And so she decided
to leave it as it was,

484
00:26:42,078 --> 00:26:46,215
with the exception of a single room
that she staked out for her own

485
00:26:46,216 --> 00:26:48,015
and gradually began
to populate it

486
00:26:48,016 --> 00:26:50,586
with the remnants
of her former self.

487
00:26:56,258 --> 00:26:58,057
From the moment Lucy was born

488
00:26:58,058 --> 00:27:01,261
Sarah had refused to hire
someone for child care.

489
00:27:01,262 --> 00:27:03,597
Read me a story?

490
00:27:03,598 --> 00:27:06,433
In a minute, okay?

491
00:27:06,434 --> 00:27:09,134
- Can I sit on your lap?
- I said in a minute!

492
00:27:09,135 --> 00:27:11,103
Go finish your program, go.

493
00:27:11,104 --> 00:27:14,173
She wasn't exactly sure
why she had taken this stance.

494
00:27:14,174 --> 00:27:17,410
The truth was she spent
most afternoons marking time,

495
00:27:17,411 --> 00:27:21,213
waiting desperately for the moment
when her husband returned from work

496
00:27:21,214 --> 00:27:24,081
and she could finally
have a moment to herself.

497
00:27:24,082 --> 00:27:26,451
But even this was not
something she could rely on.

498
00:27:26,452 --> 00:27:28,152
You're ready to roll?

499
00:27:28,153 --> 00:27:29,921
Could you wait a few minutes?

500
00:27:29,922 --> 00:27:32,489
I'm sorry, Richard's barricaded
in the upstairs office

501
00:27:32,490 --> 00:27:35,426
- finishing some stuff for work.
- No problem.

502
00:27:35,427 --> 00:27:37,361
I've got a little surprise
for someone anyway.

503
00:27:37,362 --> 00:27:39,930
She's a terror at night. I
couldn't get her to nap again.

504
00:27:39,931 --> 00:27:43,199
- Oh, the poor thing.
- Poor mom is more like it.

505
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:45,301
Hello.

506
00:27:45,302 --> 00:27:48,271
Is there a cute little
girl in the house?

507
00:27:48,272 --> 00:27:51,006
Oh, my goodness!

508
00:27:51,007 --> 00:27:53,843
What...

509
00:27:53,844 --> 00:27:56,010
What have I found?

510
00:27:56,011 --> 00:27:58,747
- A beanie.
- Oh, a beanie.

511
00:27:58,748 --> 00:28:00,515
Jean, you didn't
need to to that.

512
00:28:00,516 --> 00:28:04,319
Oh, this little dog needed
a girl to take care of him.

513
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:07,187
And I know a little girl
who needed a dog.

514
00:28:09,224 --> 00:28:11,024
Let me see.

515
00:28:11,025 --> 00:28:12,860
Sarah was
beginning to get angry.

516
00:28:12,861 --> 00:28:15,329
Her evening fitness walk
was the one thing

517
00:28:15,330 --> 00:28:18,932
she looked forward to all day,
and Richard knew this.

518
00:28:21,602 --> 00:28:23,803
But if there was one thing
life had taught Richard,

519
00:28:23,804 --> 00:28:25,772
it was that it was ridiculous

520
00:28:25,773 --> 00:28:28,707
to be at war
with your own desires.

521
00:28:28,708 --> 00:28:32,411
He could easily imagine what people
would say if they could see him now...

522
00:28:32,412 --> 00:28:35,581
Exactly the same thing they'd
say if someone had told them

523
00:28:35,582 --> 00:28:39,251
that ray from next door
was a transvestite,

524
00:28:39,252 --> 00:28:40,918
or that Ted from work

525
00:28:40,919 --> 00:28:43,688
had anonymous gay sex
at highway rest stops.

526
00:28:43,689 --> 00:28:46,991
"But we want what we want,"
Richard thought,

527
00:28:46,992 --> 00:28:49,428
"and there's not much
we can do about it."

528
00:28:50,796 --> 00:28:53,663
He had stumbled
on the site 11 months ago

529
00:28:53,664 --> 00:28:56,633
while doing research
for a consulting firm.

530
00:28:56,634 --> 00:28:59,403
His office door was wide open.

531
00:28:59,404 --> 00:29:01,706
But he clicked
on the link anyway.

532
00:29:09,579 --> 00:29:11,780
He was deeply engrossed
in his discovery

533
00:29:11,781 --> 00:29:14,416
when Ted knocked on his door.

534
00:29:14,417 --> 00:29:16,083
I'm taking lunch orders.
You want something?

535
00:29:16,084 --> 00:29:18,085
Casually, but with great haste

536
00:29:18,086 --> 00:29:21,356
Richard banished slutty Kay
from his screen...

537
00:29:21,357 --> 00:29:23,325
Uh, yeah, I'll have
a chicken Caesar.

538
00:29:23,326 --> 00:29:27,261
...And reentered
the flow of an ordinary day.

539
00:29:29,397 --> 00:29:31,598
It wasn't until
several months later

540
00:29:31,599 --> 00:29:35,302
that Richard gave the slightest thought
to the site he had stumbled upon.

541
00:29:38,071 --> 00:29:39,805
Do you need me
for anything else?

542
00:29:39,806 --> 00:29:41,807
Uh, no no, you can head home.

543
00:29:41,808 --> 00:29:43,543
I'm just gonna catch up
on some e-mail.

544
00:29:43,544 --> 00:29:46,612
Well, don't stay too late.
Your dinner will get cold.

545
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:58,923
Lately slutty
Kay had become a problem.

546
00:29:58,924 --> 00:30:01,158
He thought about her
far too often,

547
00:30:01,159 --> 00:30:02,726
and spent hours studying

548
00:30:02,727 --> 00:30:05,563
the thousands of photographs
available to him.

549
00:30:05,564 --> 00:30:08,499
Some of Kay's practices
struck him as bizarre,

550
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:10,468
even off-putting.

551
00:30:10,469 --> 00:30:13,903
She had a thing
about kitchen utensils,

552
00:30:13,904 --> 00:30:16,406
spatulas, and dressing up
like a little girl

553
00:30:16,407 --> 00:30:17,974
and playing with balloons.

554
00:30:17,975 --> 00:30:21,311
But who was Richard to judge?

555
00:30:24,313 --> 00:30:26,214
Oh, that's it.

556
00:30:26,215 --> 00:30:30,018
Though as close as Richard
sometimes felt to slutty Kay,

557
00:30:30,019 --> 00:30:32,253
as much as he believed
that he knew her,

558
00:30:32,254 --> 00:30:35,089
he could never get past
the uncomfortable fact

559
00:30:35,090 --> 00:30:39,628
that she existed for him
solely as a digital image.

560
00:30:49,236 --> 00:30:51,838
The panties were an attempt
to solve this problem.

561
00:30:51,839 --> 00:30:55,875
Maybe a sniff or two
would hurry things along,

562
00:30:55,876 --> 00:30:58,611
so he could get back
downstairs to his real life,

563
00:30:58,612 --> 00:31:00,746
where his wife
was waiting for him...

564
00:31:00,747 --> 00:31:03,816
- -...Her
impatience increasing by the minute.

565
00:31:03,817 --> 00:31:07,019
What are you doing?

566
00:31:59,468 --> 00:32:03,872
Are you almost finished there? 'Cause
I'd really like to go for my walk?

567
00:32:05,439 --> 00:32:08,909
- You could have knocked.
- I did!

568
00:32:10,310 --> 00:32:13,145
We need to talk.

569
00:32:23,756 --> 00:32:25,791
You're awfully quiet
this evening.

570
00:32:25,792 --> 00:32:29,226
- Everything okay?
- What?

571
00:32:29,227 --> 00:32:31,295
Yeah.

572
00:32:31,296 --> 00:32:33,631
You'll have to walk
without me tomorrow night.

573
00:32:33,632 --> 00:32:36,233
I've got a book group meeting.

574
00:32:36,234 --> 00:32:38,102
Okay.

575
00:32:38,103 --> 00:32:40,570
You're sure
everything's all right?

576
00:32:40,571 --> 00:32:44,440
Yeah, sorry.

577
00:32:44,441 --> 00:32:47,844
I guess I'm just a little tired.

578
00:32:47,845 --> 00:32:49,645
So what are you reading?

579
00:32:49,646 --> 00:32:51,346
"Crime and punishment."

580
00:32:51,347 --> 00:32:54,750
Wow. That's pretty
highbrow for a book group.

581
00:32:54,751 --> 00:32:58,386
Well, we have some very
stimulating discussions.

582
00:32:58,387 --> 00:33:01,088
You should come next month.
We're doing "madame bovary."

583
00:33:01,089 --> 00:33:03,424
You could be my little sister.

584
00:33:03,425 --> 00:33:04,926
Little sister?

585
00:33:04,927 --> 00:33:08,663
We're trying to get
younger women involved.

586
00:33:08,664 --> 00:33:10,598
We call them our little sisters.

587
00:33:10,599 --> 00:33:14,501
I don't know, Jean.

588
00:33:14,502 --> 00:33:17,003
I read "madame bovary"
in grad school.

589
00:33:17,004 --> 00:33:19,640
It's a pretty misogynist text.

590
00:33:19,641 --> 00:33:22,776
Well, that's an
interesting perspective.

591
00:33:22,777 --> 00:33:25,645
- You should come.
- Let me think about it.

592
00:33:25,646 --> 00:33:28,681
Oh, would you excuse me, Jean?

593
00:33:28,682 --> 00:33:32,251
Someone's at my door.
I'll call you, okay?

594
00:33:32,252 --> 00:33:34,186
Hi!

595
00:33:37,489 --> 00:33:39,191
Hi!

596
00:33:42,528 --> 00:33:45,329
Wow, god,

597
00:33:45,330 --> 00:33:46,730
this is a surprise.

598
00:33:46,731 --> 00:33:48,699
I haven't seen you since...

599
00:33:48,700 --> 00:33:51,468
I... I hope you don't mind. Your husband
said you'd be back any minute.

600
00:33:51,469 --> 00:33:52,970
Oh, no, not at all.

601
00:33:52,971 --> 00:33:55,272
It's good to see you.

602
00:33:55,273 --> 00:33:59,141
God, um, can I get you
some tea or something?

603
00:33:59,142 --> 00:34:01,711
I can only stay a minute.
I just came to warn you.

604
00:34:01,712 --> 00:34:03,580
You know that guy, the pervert?

605
00:34:03,581 --> 00:34:05,948
- Uh-huh.
- He's been riding his bike near the playground

606
00:34:05,949 --> 00:34:08,618
- checking out the kids.
- Oh, god.

607
00:34:08,619 --> 00:34:11,186
Oh, god, do the police know?

608
00:34:11,187 --> 00:34:13,188
Nothing they can do.
He's not breaking any laws.

609
00:34:13,189 --> 00:34:16,725
I guess they're just waiting
for him to kill someone.

610
00:34:16,726 --> 00:34:18,960
I just thought you should know.

611
00:34:18,961 --> 00:34:22,663
Thanks, that's nice of you.

612
00:34:22,664 --> 00:34:24,932
Let me get you some tea.

613
00:34:24,933 --> 00:34:28,937
I'm sorry. I... I don't
think it's a good idea.

614
00:34:31,372 --> 00:34:33,640
I didn't mean to kiss him.

615
00:34:33,641 --> 00:34:37,011
I don't even know
how it happened.

616
00:34:40,514 --> 00:34:43,683
I'd better go.
Mike's gonna worry.

617
00:34:48,955 --> 00:34:51,489
You wanna talk?

618
00:34:51,490 --> 00:34:53,391
I'm tired.

619
00:36:27,111 --> 00:36:29,512
Hello.

620
00:36:29,513 --> 00:36:31,848
Hey.

621
00:36:31,849 --> 00:36:35,384
No, he's still sleeping.

622
00:36:35,385 --> 00:36:38,988
Yeah, I'm, uh, I'm going
through it right now.

623
00:36:41,958 --> 00:36:45,795
No, I guess I don't need them.

624
00:36:49,031 --> 00:36:50,298
Okay.

625
00:36:51,666 --> 00:36:55,070
All right, bye.

626
00:37:58,861 --> 00:38:00,395
H-hi.

627
00:38:00,396 --> 00:38:02,663
H-hello?

628
00:38:02,664 --> 00:38:05,901
Yes, I'd like to place an order.

629
00:38:05,902 --> 00:38:09,403
Pierce, Sarah, Mrs.

630
00:38:11,406 --> 00:38:12,439
Um...

631
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:16,811
It's the, uh, red bathing suit
on page 29.

632
00:38:16,812 --> 00:38:19,213
The hide-your-tummy halter neck.

633
00:38:21,248 --> 00:38:23,951
Uh, I'm size...

634
00:38:26,086 --> 00:38:30,155
10, eight? I mean, I think.

635
00:38:30,156 --> 00:38:32,057
E-eight.

636
00:39:14,064 --> 00:39:15,830
You want to go in the pool?

637
00:39:15,831 --> 00:39:17,532
You do?

638
00:39:20,635 --> 00:39:24,139
One, two.

639
00:39:29,810 --> 00:39:32,846
Daddy, can I go in the pool now?

640
00:39:32,847 --> 00:39:34,814
In a minute, okay?

641
00:39:34,815 --> 00:39:37,985
Okay.

642
00:39:37,986 --> 00:39:40,920
There you go.

643
00:39:48,128 --> 00:39:50,828
Mommy, I have to go pee-pee.

644
00:39:50,829 --> 00:39:53,098
Just go in the pool.

645
00:39:53,099 --> 00:39:56,634
Huh-uh, I want
to go to the bathroom.

646
00:39:56,635 --> 00:39:58,603
Really?

647
00:39:58,604 --> 00:40:00,539
Okay, come on.

648
00:40:05,076 --> 00:40:06,776
Okay, ready?

649
00:40:06,777 --> 00:40:09,080
There.

650
00:40:36,271 --> 00:40:40,007
Swing down.

651
00:40:42,945 --> 00:40:46,213
Hey, I'm drumming it.

652
00:40:46,214 --> 00:40:47,213
Oh.

653
00:40:47,214 --> 00:40:51,184
Wow.

654
00:40:51,185 --> 00:40:53,886
- It's you.
- Yeah, hey.

655
00:40:53,887 --> 00:40:56,890
- Hi!
- Okay.

656
00:40:58,024 --> 00:41:00,425
I hope you don't mind.
Lucy has sensitive skin.

657
00:41:00,426 --> 00:41:03,162
She's better off in the shade.

658
00:41:03,163 --> 00:41:05,998
Oh no, not at all.

659
00:41:05,999 --> 00:41:07,399
It's nice to see you again.

660
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:09,434
Yeah, you too.

661
00:41:11,903 --> 00:41:14,305
I'm sorry,
would you get my back?

662
00:41:14,306 --> 00:41:17,641
Um... okay, sure.

663
00:41:17,642 --> 00:41:18,943
Thanks.

664
00:41:18,944 --> 00:41:20,477
Right.

665
00:41:20,478 --> 00:41:23,480
* who is knocking on the door? *

666
00:41:23,481 --> 00:41:25,148
- thanks a lot.
- * knocking on the door *

667
00:41:25,149 --> 00:41:27,150
* knocking on the door *

668
00:41:27,151 --> 00:41:30,053
- * who is knocking on the door? *
- it's okay, just...

669
00:41:30,054 --> 00:41:32,454
* a way, hey hey. *

670
00:41:32,455 --> 00:41:34,790
Lucy, say hi to the little boy
from the playground.

671
00:41:34,791 --> 00:41:36,158
Hi.

672
00:41:36,159 --> 00:41:38,727
Hi.

673
00:41:38,728 --> 00:41:41,131
You remember him?

674
00:41:46,135 --> 00:41:48,203
The pool became a ritual.

675
00:41:48,204 --> 00:41:50,972
I was trying to think.
I just didn't know the way.

676
00:41:50,973 --> 00:41:52,673
- Oh oh, okay.
- I'm here, I'm here.

677
00:41:52,674 --> 00:41:55,609
- We have the creature and we have flower.
- Right.

678
00:41:55,610 --> 00:41:58,245
Day after day they
sat together in the shade

679
00:41:58,246 --> 00:42:00,448
getting to know each other.

680
00:42:01,549 --> 00:42:04,218
This needs mustard.

681
00:42:04,219 --> 00:42:06,485
- Mustard?
- Yeah.

682
00:42:06,486 --> 00:42:08,421
Having little
choice in the matter,

683
00:42:08,422 --> 00:42:10,490
Aaron and Lucy formed
a fragile friendship.

684
00:42:16,496 --> 00:42:18,530
Aw, that's perfect.

685
00:42:18,531 --> 00:42:21,700
Sometimes Brad and
Sarah traded offspring.

686
00:42:25,538 --> 00:42:27,672
Mama said, "what papa
told you was right."

687
00:42:27,673 --> 00:42:30,774
It's not a good idea
to talk to strangers."

688
00:42:30,775 --> 00:42:35,147
It was the most
fun Sarah had had in years.

689
00:42:48,392 --> 00:42:51,426
But there was always
that longing to touch,

690
00:42:51,427 --> 00:42:55,097
to be touched by Brad.

691
00:42:55,098 --> 00:42:58,333
And, as badly as
she wanted this,

692
00:42:58,334 --> 00:43:01,936
she wanted just as badly to hold
on to the innocent public life

693
00:43:01,937 --> 00:43:04,605
they'd made for themselves
out in the open.

694
00:43:04,606 --> 00:43:07,341
So she accepted the trade...

695
00:43:07,342 --> 00:43:10,444
The melancholy handshake at 4:00

696
00:43:10,445 --> 00:43:13,547
in exchange for this
little patch of grass,

697
00:43:13,548 --> 00:43:16,283
some sunscreen
and companionship.

698
00:43:16,284 --> 00:43:20,088
One more happy day at the pool.

699
00:43:21,455 --> 00:43:24,291
Okay, no pasta for dinner, okay?

700
00:43:24,292 --> 00:43:26,592
We eat way too much
pasta around here.

701
00:43:26,593 --> 00:43:28,860
I thought you liked my pasta.

702
00:43:28,861 --> 00:43:31,130
No, I do. That's the problem.

703
00:43:31,131 --> 00:43:34,501
Pretty soon I can sell
advertising space on my ass.

704
00:43:35,502 --> 00:43:37,168
No, that's okay. I've got to go.

705
00:43:37,169 --> 00:43:39,170
I've got a 9:00 at taps.

706
00:43:39,171 --> 00:43:41,239
I thought you were
already editing.

707
00:43:41,240 --> 00:43:43,974
Yeah, so did I. It was just...

708
00:43:43,975 --> 00:43:47,813
There's something in this family's
story that really got to me.

709
00:43:50,348 --> 00:43:52,782
The father was...

710
00:43:52,783 --> 00:43:55,552
K-i-l-l-e-d

711
00:43:55,553 --> 00:43:59,089
in a, um, mortar attack,

712
00:43:59,090 --> 00:44:02,226
and, um, left behind
a little boy.

713
00:44:04,494 --> 00:44:06,929
I was talking to the mother
the other day on the phone,

714
00:44:06,930 --> 00:44:10,765
and she was saying she didn't know what
she was going to do next Christmas.

715
00:44:10,766 --> 00:44:14,702
- Jeez, I bet.
- No, it wasn't like that. It was more...

716
00:44:14,703 --> 00:44:17,705
She was wondering, should she
keep this tradition with her son

717
00:44:17,706 --> 00:44:19,474
that began with
the boy's father.

718
00:44:19,475 --> 00:44:22,343
And she was saying
he had this knack

719
00:44:22,344 --> 00:44:25,179
for requesting
odd Christmas gifts...

720
00:44:25,180 --> 00:44:27,148
Scuba gear one year

721
00:44:27,149 --> 00:44:29,683
and rappelling gear the next.

722
00:44:29,684 --> 00:44:33,719
She said he wasn't
afraid to try anything.

723
00:44:33,720 --> 00:44:36,656
Trying new things
made him feel...

724
00:44:36,657 --> 00:44:39,660
More alive.

725
00:44:41,428 --> 00:44:44,896
I've got to go. See you later.

726
00:44:53,573 --> 00:44:56,907
Patch one of your best and
then we'll patch both of them.

727
00:44:56,908 --> 00:44:58,876
Okay?

728
00:45:01,446 --> 00:45:04,014
Hey, I got something.

729
00:45:08,286 --> 00:45:10,920
Hot enough for you?

730
00:45:10,921 --> 00:45:13,656
Yeah.

731
00:45:13,657 --> 00:45:16,559
Yeah, it's so humid.

732
00:45:16,560 --> 00:45:20,196
I've got football
practice tonight.

733
00:45:20,197 --> 00:45:22,198
Be like playing in a sauna.

734
00:45:22,199 --> 00:45:25,701
Watch out for that Italian guy.

735
00:45:25,702 --> 00:45:28,204
What's his name?

736
00:45:28,205 --> 00:45:29,538
Corrente?

737
00:45:29,539 --> 00:45:32,373
Yeah.

738
00:45:32,374 --> 00:45:34,942
Remember what happened
to your knee last week?

739
00:45:34,943 --> 00:45:37,546
You should be careful, Brad.

740
00:45:40,148 --> 00:45:41,981
I'll be careful.

741
00:45:41,982 --> 00:45:44,652
Promise?

742
00:45:46,721 --> 00:45:50,758
Yeah. Yeah, I promise.

743
00:45:53,660 --> 00:45:56,262
Weatherman said
scattered showers.

744
00:45:56,263 --> 00:45:58,465
I don't see scattered showers.

745
00:46:08,106 --> 00:46:11,042
Mom, could I please have
some money for a snack?

746
00:46:11,043 --> 00:46:13,945
No, sweetheart. You guys
just had a snack. No.

747
00:46:13,946 --> 00:46:15,347
Oh, okay.

748
00:46:15,348 --> 00:46:17,348
All they want is sugar.

749
00:46:17,349 --> 00:46:19,384
Constantly.

750
00:47:37,121 --> 00:47:39,324
Oh, no.

751
00:47:46,196 --> 00:47:48,865
It's him.

752
00:47:49,999 --> 00:47:52,001
Oh, Jesus.

753
00:47:59,408 --> 00:48:01,509
Oh my god, it's him.

754
00:48:01,510 --> 00:48:04,245
He's in the pool.

755
00:48:04,246 --> 00:48:06,381
Oh my god!

756
00:48:06,382 --> 00:48:08,483
Jacob, get out of the pool now!

757
00:48:08,484 --> 00:48:10,551
Oh my god. That's him.

758
00:48:10,552 --> 00:48:14,555
- Get away from that man.
- Why is everybody running to the pool?

759
00:48:14,556 --> 00:48:16,357
Brooke? Jake?

760
00:48:16,358 --> 00:48:19,561
Dale, you'd
better get over here.

761
00:48:23,430 --> 00:48:27,368
Get out of the pool!

762
00:48:34,640 --> 00:48:37,743
Where's your sister?

763
00:48:46,117 --> 00:48:50,053
Why'd we have to get out, mom?

764
00:48:50,054 --> 00:48:52,924
I'm scared.

765
00:48:57,995 --> 00:49:01,465
- What did he do?
- What's going on?

766
00:49:16,713 --> 00:49:19,648
I'm scared.

767
00:49:24,753 --> 00:49:27,422
Um, why the police is here?

768
00:49:27,423 --> 00:49:31,425
Um, there's a man over there who
doesn't have a ticket to get in,

769
00:49:31,426 --> 00:49:33,192
so they're asking
him to go home.

770
00:49:33,193 --> 00:49:35,061
Mr. mcgorvey. Mr. mcgorvey.

771
00:49:35,062 --> 00:49:37,398
It'd be wise for you to get
out of the pool at this time.

772
00:49:45,104 --> 00:49:47,205
Did that man go near you?

773
00:49:47,206 --> 00:49:50,376
You're sure he didn't touch you?

774
00:49:54,413 --> 00:49:56,915
Step out of the pool, sir.

775
00:50:15,899 --> 00:50:19,268
I was only trying to cool off.

776
00:50:19,269 --> 00:50:22,806
All right, let's go. Come on.

777
00:50:27,076 --> 00:50:30,480
You can go back in the pool.

778
00:51:02,909 --> 00:51:06,812
May I have your attention,
please? You know what that sound means.

779
00:51:06,813 --> 00:51:10,215
Let's go. Out of the pool.
We're closing her up. Let's go.

780
00:51:10,216 --> 00:51:13,450
Exit the pool and
vacate the grounds immediately.

781
00:51:13,451 --> 00:51:15,252
Okay, I'll see you tomorrow.

782
00:51:15,253 --> 00:51:17,888
You're going to carry her? Come
on, put her in the stroller.

783
00:51:17,889 --> 00:51:19,824
- No, she won't do the stroller.
- Come on, really?

784
00:51:19,825 --> 00:51:21,992
- No, no, she will not do this.
- Lucy, would you like to go in the stroller?

785
00:51:21,993 --> 00:51:24,795
Can I interest you in a stroller?
It appears she'd like a stroller.

786
00:51:25,963 --> 00:51:27,964
It's out of your way.

787
00:51:27,965 --> 00:51:31,367
No, it's fine. You don't
mind, do you, Aaron?

788
00:51:31,368 --> 00:51:33,702
Run!

789
00:51:43,980 --> 00:51:46,949
You'd better come inside.
You can't walk home in this.

790
00:51:49,251 --> 00:51:50,986
Oh!

791
00:51:59,126 --> 00:52:02,964
- You can put him down in Lucy's room.
- Okay.

792
00:52:07,568 --> 00:52:09,569
This is amazing.

793
00:52:09,570 --> 00:52:12,171
She never naps.

794
00:52:12,172 --> 00:52:14,406
Well, he'll be out for
the next two hours.

795
00:52:14,407 --> 00:52:17,176
We'll have to get him out
of that nightgown, though,

796
00:52:17,177 --> 00:52:19,645
before he wakes up
or he'll never forgive me.

797
00:52:30,521 --> 00:52:31,689
Nice place.

798
00:52:31,690 --> 00:52:33,323
- You think so?
- Yeah.

799
00:52:33,324 --> 00:52:35,425
Well, Richard does
all right for himself.

800
00:52:35,426 --> 00:52:37,294
What's he do, again?

801
00:52:37,295 --> 00:52:40,998
Lies. Um, please have a seat.
Make yourself comfortable.

802
00:52:40,999 --> 00:52:42,765
Better not, I might
ruin your furniture.

803
00:52:42,766 --> 00:52:45,902
I'll put these things in the
dryer and get us some towels.

804
00:52:45,903 --> 00:52:47,503
Okay.

805
00:54:51,050 --> 00:54:54,253
Oh, god!

806
00:54:56,255 --> 00:54:58,555
Oh, god!

807
00:55:03,061 --> 00:55:06,530
Do you feel bad about this?

808
00:55:06,531 --> 00:55:09,066
No, I don't.

809
00:55:09,067 --> 00:55:10,934
I do.

810
00:55:10,935 --> 00:55:13,536
I feel really bad.

811
00:55:13,537 --> 00:55:14,637
Okay.

812
00:55:51,205 --> 00:55:52,840
Son?

813
00:55:57,577 --> 00:55:59,712
Son?

814
00:56:02,115 --> 00:56:04,184
Be well.

815
00:56:08,988 --> 00:56:10,688
May knew it wasn't natural

816
00:56:10,689 --> 00:56:12,757
for a grown man to be
living with his mother.

817
00:56:12,758 --> 00:56:14,793
No hobbies, no diversions.

818
00:56:14,794 --> 00:56:17,560
It was like he was
still in prison.

819
00:56:17,561 --> 00:56:19,562
What he needed was a girlfriend,

820
00:56:19,563 --> 00:56:22,365
and may intended to
help him find one.

821
00:56:22,366 --> 00:56:25,568
There are four whole columns
of lonely women here,

822
00:56:25,569 --> 00:56:28,205
and only a handful of men.
The odds are on our side.

823
00:56:28,206 --> 00:56:30,807
Why wouldn't one of
these women want

824
00:56:30,808 --> 00:56:33,575
to meet a nice person like you?

825
00:56:33,576 --> 00:56:36,012
I'm not a nice person.

826
00:56:36,013 --> 00:56:38,380
You did a bad thing.

827
00:56:38,381 --> 00:56:40,882
But that doesn't mean
you're a bad person.

828
00:56:40,883 --> 00:56:43,418
I have a psychosexual disorder.

829
00:56:43,419 --> 00:56:44,652
You're better now.

830
00:56:44,653 --> 00:56:46,822
They wouldn't have let
you out if you weren't.

831
00:56:46,823 --> 00:56:49,157
They let me out
because they had to.

832
00:56:49,158 --> 00:56:51,826
Well, maybe if you found

833
00:56:51,827 --> 00:56:54,094
a girlfriend closer
to your own age

834
00:56:54,095 --> 00:56:57,031
you wouldn't have
the bad urges so often.

835
00:56:57,032 --> 00:56:59,733
I don't want a girlfriend
my own age, mommy.

836
00:56:59,734 --> 00:57:02,437
I wish I did.

837
00:57:05,172 --> 00:57:07,273
What are you going
to do when I'm gone?

838
00:57:07,274 --> 00:57:10,077
Who's going to take care of you?

839
00:57:13,047 --> 00:57:15,248
What's the matter, mommy?

840
00:57:18,051 --> 00:57:19,852
Are you sick or something?

841
00:57:19,853 --> 00:57:22,654
I'm an old woman. I'm not
going to live forever.

842
00:57:22,655 --> 00:57:24,756
Who's going to cook for you?

843
00:57:24,757 --> 00:57:26,557
Who's going to wash the dishes?

844
00:57:26,558 --> 00:57:29,026
I can wash the dishes.

845
00:57:29,027 --> 00:57:30,761
You've never washed
a dish in your life.

846
00:57:30,762 --> 00:57:33,797
I could do it if I had to.
I'm not a retard.

847
00:57:33,798 --> 00:57:36,401
No, you're not.

848
00:57:37,835 --> 00:57:40,537
You're a miracle, Ronnie.

849
00:57:42,406 --> 00:57:45,408
We're all miracles.

850
00:57:45,409 --> 00:57:48,011
You know why?

851
00:57:48,012 --> 00:57:50,212
Because as humans,

852
00:57:50,213 --> 00:57:54,349
everyday we go
about our business,

853
00:57:54,350 --> 00:57:56,886
and all that time

854
00:57:56,887 --> 00:57:59,888
we know, we all know

855
00:57:59,889 --> 00:58:03,124
that the things we love,

856
00:58:03,125 --> 00:58:07,062
the people we love...

857
00:58:08,931 --> 00:58:12,901
At any time, it can
all be taken away.

858
00:58:16,704 --> 00:58:19,639
We live knowing that

859
00:58:19,640 --> 00:58:22,910
and we keep going anyway.

860
00:58:28,115 --> 00:58:30,918
Animals don't do that.

861
00:58:35,054 --> 00:58:38,357
Now I'm not asking you
to get married, Ronnie.

862
00:58:39,791 --> 00:58:43,261
I'm just saying put an ad in
the paper, see what happens.

863
00:58:43,262 --> 00:58:46,830
Fine. I'll do it if
it will make you happy.

864
00:58:46,831 --> 00:58:49,434
But just one date. All right?

865
00:58:52,403 --> 00:58:55,539
You have a nice smile, why
don't we start with that?

866
00:58:55,540 --> 00:58:58,943
What else?

867
00:59:00,777 --> 00:59:04,080
You always eat what I put in front of you.
You never complain.

868
00:59:04,081 --> 00:59:06,983
What else?

869
00:59:06,984 --> 00:59:08,850
You're trying to
get back in shape.

870
00:59:08,851 --> 00:59:10,886
You exercise.

871
00:59:21,829 --> 00:59:23,830
Wait right there, young man.

872
00:59:23,831 --> 00:59:26,167
If you're going out
for some exercise,

873
00:59:26,168 --> 00:59:29,137
you can post this now.

874
00:59:31,738 --> 00:59:34,375
Hmm.

875
01:00:06,404 --> 01:00:08,406
Mmm.

876
01:00:11,042 --> 01:00:13,576
Come on.

877
01:00:13,577 --> 01:00:15,312
Let's do it again.

878
01:00:17,780 --> 01:00:20,183
All right.

879
01:00:21,151 --> 01:00:23,952
God, it's hot as hell up here.

880
01:00:23,953 --> 01:00:26,122
What's wrong with
the laundry room?

881
01:00:26,123 --> 01:00:29,290
No mattress.

882
01:00:29,291 --> 01:00:32,694
Come on. Lie down.

883
01:00:47,375 --> 01:00:49,376
You're nervous, aren't you?

884
01:00:49,377 --> 01:00:51,477
What? What do you mean?

885
01:00:51,478 --> 01:00:53,212
The game.

886
01:00:53,213 --> 01:00:58,052
Don't worry. You'll
be great tonight.

887
01:00:59,253 --> 01:01:02,588
I don't know. I haven't
played in 10 years.

888
01:01:04,390 --> 01:01:07,259
It used to be my whole life.

889
01:01:07,260 --> 01:01:10,128
Then when I stopped, I just...

890
01:01:10,129 --> 01:01:13,498
Stopped. I didn't even miss it.

891
01:01:14,999 --> 01:01:17,601
Now that I'm playing again, I...

892
01:01:17,602 --> 01:01:20,405
Feel I...

893
01:01:22,074 --> 01:01:24,774
I don't know.

894
01:01:24,775 --> 01:01:26,809
You feel alive.

895
01:01:26,810 --> 01:01:28,178
Yeah.

896
01:01:28,179 --> 01:01:30,713
That's good.

897
01:01:30,714 --> 01:01:32,915
That's how you're
supposed to feel.

898
01:01:32,916 --> 01:01:36,385
You're right.

899
01:01:36,386 --> 01:01:40,022
I guess it's just been awhile.

900
01:01:41,391 --> 01:01:43,759
Yeah.

901
01:02:30,202 --> 01:02:32,403
Shake.

902
01:02:53,557 --> 01:02:56,125
- Call it.
- Heads.

903
01:02:57,293 --> 01:02:59,695
Heads it is.

904
01:03:00,729 --> 01:03:04,599
Ready?

905
01:03:13,308 --> 01:03:15,776
- Hello?
- Hi, mom. Did I wake you?

906
01:03:15,777 --> 01:03:17,943
Oh, no honey.
Is everything okay?

907
01:03:17,944 --> 01:03:19,645
Yeah, I'm fine.

908
01:03:19,646 --> 01:03:21,314
You don't sound fine.

909
01:03:21,315 --> 01:03:23,949
No, there's nothing wrong.
I just wanted to say hi.

910
01:03:23,950 --> 01:03:26,286
Well, hi.

911
01:03:26,287 --> 01:03:27,687
Hi.

912
01:03:27,688 --> 01:03:29,288
So how's my little guy?

913
01:03:29,289 --> 01:03:31,556
He's great. He's sleeping
right here next to me.

914
01:03:31,557 --> 01:03:33,325
He's such a cutie.

915
01:03:33,326 --> 01:03:35,327
So where's Brad?

916
01:03:35,328 --> 01:03:37,296
Brad's out.

917
01:03:37,297 --> 01:03:40,298
Oh, I'm surprised the library
stays open this late.

918
01:03:40,299 --> 01:03:42,132
Well, he's not at the library.

919
01:03:42,133 --> 01:03:43,867
He's playing football
with some buddies.

920
01:03:43,868 --> 01:03:46,537
Oh, honey. Do you remember
when your father took up golf?

921
01:03:46,538 --> 01:03:49,240
He's not like dad.

922
01:03:49,241 --> 01:03:51,841
Honey, they're all the same.

923
01:03:51,842 --> 01:03:54,043
Well, he's not.

924
01:03:54,044 --> 01:03:57,146
You work so hard.

925
01:03:57,147 --> 01:03:59,416
Now listen...

926
01:03:59,417 --> 01:04:01,618
I could keep an eye on the
boys when you're at work;

927
01:04:01,619 --> 01:04:04,353
Make sure they're staying out of trouble.
Do you want me to come up for a visit?

928
01:04:04,354 --> 01:04:07,223
- No no, mom, don't come.
- Well, honey, I worry about you kids.

929
01:04:07,224 --> 01:04:09,691
Now what are you going to do
if he fails the test again?

930
01:04:09,692 --> 01:04:11,393
He's not going to fail the test.

931
01:04:11,394 --> 01:04:13,161
Oh, honey, that's what
you said last time.

932
01:04:13,162 --> 01:04:14,995
Now how are you doing for money?

933
01:04:14,996 --> 01:04:17,265
Oh, we're fine.

934
01:04:17,266 --> 01:04:20,668
I'm going to send you a
little extra this month.

935
01:04:20,669 --> 01:04:22,203
- Mom...
- honey, it's no burden.

936
01:04:22,204 --> 01:04:25,905
- Mom... mom, please.
- I'm happy to help.

937
01:04:30,678 --> 01:04:33,714
Aw, shit.

938
01:04:39,286 --> 01:04:41,787
Although the
guardians lost by 26 points,

939
01:04:41,788 --> 01:04:44,990
Brad felt oddly exhilarated
in the bar after the game.

940
01:04:47,026 --> 01:04:49,694
He could feel a new respect in
the way the cops looked at him.

941
01:04:49,695 --> 01:04:53,265
- What you drinking, buddy?
- He wasn't on probation anymore.

942
01:04:53,266 --> 01:04:54,666
He was a member of the team.

943
01:04:54,667 --> 01:04:56,401
Ice and advil.

944
01:04:56,402 --> 01:04:58,603
If all else fails, you can
always see the team physician,

945
01:04:58,604 --> 01:05:00,871
Dr. Daniels. All his
friends call him Jack.

946
01:05:00,872 --> 01:05:03,475
- To the good doctor.
- Hear, hear.

947
01:05:06,143 --> 01:05:09,380
- Larry? Here, you go Larry.
- Oh, thanks.

948
01:05:09,381 --> 01:05:11,682
Let me just grab a chair.

949
01:05:17,521 --> 01:05:21,558
Oh, we just gave you a shot.
We just gave you a shot.

950
01:05:29,465 --> 01:05:32,701
I had no business being
on that field tonight.

951
01:05:32,702 --> 01:05:34,768
I let you down.

952
01:05:34,769 --> 01:05:36,470
I let the whole team down.

953
01:05:36,471 --> 01:05:38,339
I'm slow and I'm fat.

954
01:05:38,340 --> 01:05:40,107
I let that guy piss all over me.

955
01:05:40,108 --> 01:05:43,278
Come on. That guy was
offsides the whole night.

956
01:05:46,447 --> 01:05:49,282
Joanie left me.

957
01:05:49,283 --> 01:05:52,486
Took the kids and went
to her mother's.

958
01:05:53,854 --> 01:05:56,254
Jesus, Larry,
that's a tough break.

959
01:05:56,255 --> 01:05:58,223
Oh, I deserved it.

960
01:05:58,224 --> 01:06:00,258
Me and my big mouth.

961
01:06:00,259 --> 01:06:02,394
I called her a fucking whore,

962
01:06:02,395 --> 01:06:04,597
right in front of the kids.

963
01:06:06,265 --> 01:06:08,599
Why did you do that?

964
01:06:08,600 --> 01:06:10,635
Huh, I don't know.

965
01:06:10,636 --> 01:06:14,505
I was in a bad mood
or something.

966
01:06:14,506 --> 01:06:16,741
Now I'm fucked.

967
01:06:23,548 --> 01:06:25,815
Hey, did you hear
about the pervert?

968
01:06:25,816 --> 01:06:28,051
He went swimming
at the town pool.

969
01:06:28,052 --> 01:06:29,686
- What?
- Yeah.

970
01:06:29,687 --> 01:06:31,987
- Who told you that?
- Nobody. I saw it myself.

971
01:06:31,988 --> 01:06:34,323
- The town pool?
- Yeah, during the heatwave.

972
01:06:34,324 --> 01:06:35,791
- The town pool?
- Yep.

973
01:06:35,792 --> 01:06:37,660
Th-that place is
crawling with kids.

974
01:06:37,661 --> 01:06:39,227
I mean, my boys go there.

975
01:06:39,228 --> 01:06:41,829
Yeah, well, you know what,
it was just that one time.

976
01:06:41,830 --> 01:06:44,298
Um, he... he won't be back.
The cops came.

977
01:06:44,299 --> 01:06:47,268
Cops? What cops?
A... anyone from the team?

978
01:06:47,269 --> 01:06:48,936
Uh uh, no.

979
01:06:48,937 --> 01:06:51,038
You sure?

980
01:06:51,039 --> 01:06:53,607
- Anyone from the team show up there?
- No, no.

981
01:06:53,608 --> 01:06:55,241
- Yes or no!
- I'm saying no.

982
01:06:55,242 --> 01:06:58,912
- No, nobody...
- Jesus Christ, that little fucking weasel.

983
01:06:58,913 --> 01:07:00,313
Larry, slow down.

984
01:07:00,314 --> 01:07:02,784
Slow down, Larry!

985
01:07:09,923 --> 01:07:12,124
- What now?
- Good evening, Mrs. mcgorvey.

986
01:07:12,125 --> 01:07:14,427
- We were wondering if Ronnie was home.
- You leave him alone.

987
01:07:14,428 --> 01:07:16,428
We just want a moment of his time.
Just a little chat.

988
01:07:16,429 --> 01:07:18,363
This is my house.
I pay the mortgage,

989
01:07:18,364 --> 01:07:20,298
and I say who is and isn't...

990
01:07:20,299 --> 01:07:22,033
Yoo-hoo, Ronnie!

991
01:07:22,034 --> 01:07:24,769
- Get your perverted ass down here now.
- I'm calling the police.

992
01:07:24,770 --> 01:07:27,004
I hear they're well-disposed
to child molesters.

993
01:07:27,005 --> 01:07:28,772
It's okay, mommy.
Can I help you, gentlemen?

994
01:07:28,773 --> 01:07:30,441
Ronnie, you go on upstairs.

995
01:07:30,442 --> 01:07:32,943
Larry, let him go. I think he gets
the point. We can go home now.

996
01:07:32,944 --> 01:07:34,945
You listen to me, you
little piece of shit.

997
01:07:34,946 --> 01:07:37,347
You stay the fuck away
from the town pool.

998
01:07:37,348 --> 01:07:39,550
- You hear me?
- You're a bully!

999
01:07:46,757 --> 01:07:50,026
My Ronnie would
never do what he did.

1000
01:07:52,729 --> 01:07:56,433
That poor child at the mall...

1001
01:07:57,434 --> 01:08:00,903
What you did to him.

1002
01:08:17,084 --> 01:08:19,454
Larry?

1003
01:08:23,123 --> 01:08:24,657
Larry?

1004
01:08:24,658 --> 01:08:27,960
Why did she say that?

1005
01:08:27,961 --> 01:08:30,696
Oh, don't pretend you
don't know about me.

1006
01:08:30,697 --> 01:08:32,097
Everybody knows. Everybody!

1007
01:08:32,098 --> 01:08:35,467
Look, h-honestly,
I... I don't know anything.

1008
01:08:35,468 --> 01:08:38,069
I remember hearing something...

1009
01:08:38,070 --> 01:08:42,006
A few years ago when we
first moved here, but...

1010
01:08:42,007 --> 01:08:44,208
Something about a... a shooting

1011
01:08:44,209 --> 01:08:46,377
at the mall.

1012
01:08:46,378 --> 01:08:49,913
That's... that's it. That's all.

1013
01:08:49,914 --> 01:08:52,584
I didn't even know you then.

1014
01:08:56,988 --> 01:08:59,022
I'm sorry.

1015
01:09:01,257 --> 01:09:03,460
Sorry.

1016
01:09:04,260 --> 01:09:06,563
It's okay.

1017
01:09:12,134 --> 01:09:15,870
Dispatch said there was a
shooter loose at the mall.

1018
01:09:15,871 --> 01:09:18,106
It was 10 minutes from
the end of my shift.

1019
01:09:18,107 --> 01:09:20,942
10 minutes and there would
have been someone else.

1020
01:09:23,545 --> 01:09:26,815
I can still see that boy's
face staring up at me.

1021
01:09:27,616 --> 01:09:31,351
Yeah, but...
But it was an accident.

1022
01:09:31,352 --> 01:09:33,419
You were trying to stop a guy,

1023
01:09:33,420 --> 01:09:36,756
and the... the boy g-got caught

1024
01:09:36,757 --> 01:09:38,457
in the crossfire, right?

1025
01:09:38,458 --> 01:09:40,326
No, I panicked.

1026
01:09:40,327 --> 01:09:42,294
There was no shooter.

1027
01:09:42,295 --> 01:09:44,095
Just the boy.

1028
01:09:44,096 --> 01:09:47,465
Antoine Harris was his name.

1029
01:09:47,466 --> 01:09:50,401
He was big for his age,
only 13 years old.

1030
01:09:50,402 --> 01:09:53,104
He was a good kid.
Thought it was a joke,

1031
01:09:53,105 --> 01:09:55,272
waving around an air gun
at his friend

1032
01:09:55,273 --> 01:09:57,041
in the big 5.

1033
01:09:57,042 --> 01:09:59,877
They were acting out some scene
from some movie they liked.

1034
01:09:59,878 --> 01:10:02,112
Shop girl saw it
from across the way,

1035
01:10:02,113 --> 01:10:05,583
called 911.

1036
01:10:05,584 --> 01:10:08,552
Jesus, that's terrible.

1037
01:10:08,553 --> 01:10:11,254
That...

1038
01:10:11,255 --> 01:10:13,757
Well, you didn't know.

1039
01:10:13,758 --> 01:10:15,992
It could have been real.

1040
01:10:15,993 --> 01:10:18,061
But it wasn't.

1041
01:10:23,700 --> 01:10:26,501
His parents...

1042
01:10:26,502 --> 01:10:29,137
Uh, his parents...

1043
01:10:32,007 --> 01:10:34,009
I had to...

1044
01:10:51,192 --> 01:10:53,726
I was diagnosed with
post-traumatic stress syndrome

1045
01:10:53,727 --> 01:10:56,862
by three different
psychiatrists.

1046
01:10:56,863 --> 01:10:59,732
That's why I retired.

1047
01:10:59,733 --> 01:11:02,768
I couldn't do the job anymore.

1048
01:11:07,740 --> 01:11:10,809
- So why don't you do something else?
- Like what?

1049
01:11:10,810 --> 01:11:13,979
Drive a forklift at costco?

1050
01:11:15,680 --> 01:11:19,116
Maybe you could
go back to school.

1051
01:11:19,117 --> 01:11:20,984
I loved my job.

1052
01:11:20,985 --> 01:11:23,622
I don't wanna do anything else.

1053
01:11:35,999 --> 01:11:39,802
You ever think about the term
"homeland security"?

1054
01:11:41,437 --> 01:11:43,640
I mean, really think about it?

1055
01:11:49,344 --> 01:11:51,345
The day that you found out

1056
01:11:51,346 --> 01:11:54,915
that your father had
been killed in Iraq,

1057
01:11:54,916 --> 01:11:56,984
do you remember that day?

1058
01:11:56,985 --> 01:11:58,653
Can you talk about that?

1059
01:11:58,654 --> 01:12:00,955
You feel comfortable
talking about that?

1060
01:12:05,292 --> 01:12:09,228
After the men came

1061
01:12:09,229 --> 01:12:11,730
to tell my mom,

1062
01:12:11,731 --> 01:12:14,266
I cried,

1063
01:12:14,267 --> 01:12:17,736
but she didn't.

1064
01:12:17,737 --> 01:12:20,272
She just went up to her room

1065
01:12:20,273 --> 01:12:24,208
and grabbed the pillows
off the bed,

1066
01:12:24,209 --> 01:12:27,612
cut the tops off of them
with a pair scissors.

1067
01:12:29,715 --> 01:12:33,118
There were feathers
all over the place.

1068
01:12:34,218 --> 01:12:36,754
That must have really
frightened you.

1069
01:12:37,989 --> 01:12:41,392
No, she was trying
to find the crown.

1070
01:12:42,459 --> 01:12:43,994
The crown?

1071
01:12:43,995 --> 01:12:45,995
The crown you leave
in your pillow

1072
01:12:45,996 --> 01:12:48,765
when you've slept on it
for a long time.

1073
01:12:51,101 --> 01:12:53,202
My...

1074
01:12:53,203 --> 01:12:55,971
My father had two crowns.

1075
01:12:55,972 --> 01:12:59,507
Stop there.

1076
01:12:59,508 --> 01:13:02,677
- You hungry?
- No.

1077
01:13:02,678 --> 01:13:04,545
Mind if I get some lunch?

1078
01:13:04,546 --> 01:13:07,416
No, go ahead.

1079
01:13:28,802 --> 01:13:30,936
Brad?

1080
01:13:30,937 --> 01:13:34,539
Honey, you there?

1081
01:13:34,540 --> 01:13:38,076
Pick up. I know you're there.

1082
01:13:38,077 --> 01:13:40,880
It's Aaron's nap time.

1083
01:13:43,982 --> 01:13:46,616
Okay, I guess you guys
are out somewhere.

1084
01:13:46,617 --> 01:13:49,219
Um...

1085
01:13:49,220 --> 01:13:51,756
I love you both.

1086
01:13:51,757 --> 01:13:54,024
Bye.

1087
01:14:41,101 --> 01:14:44,203
I certainly did.

1088
01:14:44,204 --> 01:14:46,406
Here we go.

1089
01:14:47,774 --> 01:14:50,008
I don't know, Jean. I don't
think I'm up for this.

1090
01:14:50,009 --> 01:14:51,876
Well, now don't be silly.

1091
01:14:51,877 --> 01:14:53,878
- It'll be fun.
- Really?

1092
01:14:53,879 --> 01:14:57,015
- You're not the only little sister here tonight.
- Oh, that's good.

1093
01:14:57,016 --> 01:14:59,884
Oh!

1094
01:14:59,885 --> 01:15:01,785
Hi, would you like a glass?

1095
01:15:01,786 --> 01:15:05,755
Did anybody like this book?
Because I really just hated it.

1096
01:15:05,756 --> 01:15:07,424
It's so depressing.

1097
01:15:07,425 --> 01:15:09,559
She cheats on her husband
with two different guys,

1098
01:15:09,560 --> 01:15:12,295
wastes all his money, then
kills herself with rat poison?

1099
01:15:12,296 --> 01:15:14,430
Do I really need to read this?

1100
01:15:14,431 --> 01:15:18,134
Well, there is a lot of
good descriptive writing.

1101
01:15:18,135 --> 01:15:20,336
It's supposed to be depressing.

1102
01:15:20,337 --> 01:15:22,104
It's a tragedy.

1103
01:15:22,105 --> 01:15:25,673
Madame bovary was undone
by a tragic flaw.

1104
01:15:25,674 --> 01:15:27,642
What's her flaw?

1105
01:15:27,643 --> 01:15:29,444
Blindness. She didn't see

1106
01:15:29,445 --> 01:15:31,579
that the men were
just using her.

1107
01:15:31,580 --> 01:15:34,315
She just wants a little
romance in her life.

1108
01:15:34,316 --> 01:15:38,052
- You can't blame her for that.
- It's about women's choices.

1109
01:15:38,053 --> 01:15:40,855
Back then, a woman didn't
have a lot of choices.

1110
01:15:40,856 --> 01:15:43,057
You could be a nun or a wife.

1111
01:15:43,058 --> 01:15:46,792
- That's all there was.
- Or a prostitute.

1112
01:15:46,793 --> 01:15:48,061
She had a choice.

1113
01:15:48,062 --> 01:15:50,463
She had a choice not
to cheat on her husband.

1114
01:15:50,464 --> 01:15:54,533
I found it refreshing
to read about a woman

1115
01:15:54,534 --> 01:15:56,235
reclaiming her sexuality.

1116
01:15:56,236 --> 01:15:58,670
Is that a nice way
of saying she's a slut?

1117
01:15:58,671 --> 01:16:01,206
Madame bovary's not a slut.

1118
01:16:01,207 --> 01:16:05,010
She's one of the great characters
in western literature.

1119
01:16:05,011 --> 01:16:08,847
I was a little puzzled by some
of the sexual references.

1120
01:16:08,848 --> 01:16:10,647
Look, like... like this one.

1121
01:16:10,648 --> 01:16:13,084
Um...

1122
01:16:13,085 --> 01:16:15,819
"He abandoned every last shred"

1123
01:16:15,820 --> 01:16:17,621
of restraint and consideration.

1124
01:16:17,622 --> 01:16:21,224
He turned her
into something compliant,

1125
01:16:21,225 --> 01:16:24,061
"something corrupt."

1126
01:16:27,865 --> 01:16:30,100
Does anyone know
what that means?

1127
01:16:30,101 --> 01:16:31,967
It means she's a slut.

1128
01:16:31,968 --> 01:16:33,969
Is he tying her up

1129
01:16:33,970 --> 01:16:36,271
or something?

1130
01:16:36,272 --> 01:16:38,707
Anal sex.

1131
01:16:38,708 --> 01:16:40,976
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

1132
01:16:40,977 --> 01:16:44,712
Did everyone get that but me?

1133
01:16:44,713 --> 01:16:47,681
Let's set that aside for now.

1134
01:16:47,682 --> 01:16:49,483
I'm really eager to hear what

1135
01:16:49,484 --> 01:16:52,386
our other little sister
has to say.

1136
01:16:52,387 --> 01:16:55,322
I'm not sure if you know
this, but Sarah has a phd

1137
01:16:55,323 --> 01:16:58,091
in english lit.

1138
01:16:58,092 --> 01:17:00,227
Just a masters.

1139
01:17:00,228 --> 01:17:02,229
I never wrote my dissertation.

1140
01:17:02,230 --> 01:17:05,598
Well, you still have
a lot more expertise

1141
01:17:05,599 --> 01:17:08,035
than the rest of us.

1142
01:17:12,472 --> 01:17:15,274
I think I understand your
feelings about this book.

1143
01:17:15,275 --> 01:17:19,010
I used to have some
problems with it myself.

1144
01:17:19,011 --> 01:17:21,012
When I read it in grad school,

1145
01:17:21,013 --> 01:17:24,015
madame bovary just
seemed like a fool.

1146
01:17:24,016 --> 01:17:26,317
She marries the wrong man,

1147
01:17:26,318 --> 01:17:29,853
makes one foolish mistake
after another.

1148
01:17:29,854 --> 01:17:33,890
But when I read it this time,
I just fell in love with her.

1149
01:17:33,891 --> 01:17:36,226
She's trapped.

1150
01:17:36,227 --> 01:17:39,396
She has a choice. She can
either accept a life of misery

1151
01:17:39,397 --> 01:17:43,066
or she can struggle against it.

1152
01:17:43,067 --> 01:17:45,301
And she chooses to struggle.

1153
01:17:45,302 --> 01:17:47,570
Some struggle... Hop into bed

1154
01:17:47,571 --> 01:17:49,572
with every guy who says hello.

1155
01:17:49,573 --> 01:17:53,275
Well, she fails in the end, but
there's something beautiful

1156
01:17:53,276 --> 01:17:56,678
and even heroic
in her rebellion.

1157
01:17:56,679 --> 01:17:59,481
My professors would kill
me for even thinking this,

1158
01:17:59,482 --> 01:18:01,449
but...

1159
01:18:01,450 --> 01:18:04,085
In her own strange way,

1160
01:18:04,086 --> 01:18:06,087
Emma bovary is a feminist.

1161
01:18:06,088 --> 01:18:07,854
Oh, that's nice.

1162
01:18:07,855 --> 01:18:10,958
So now cheating on your
husband makes you a feminist?

1163
01:18:10,959 --> 01:18:13,494
No, no, no.

1164
01:18:13,495 --> 01:18:17,197
It's not the cheating.
It's the hunger.

1165
01:18:17,198 --> 01:18:19,565
The hunger for an alternative,

1166
01:18:19,566 --> 01:18:23,270
and the refusal to accept
a life of unhappiness.

1167
01:18:31,978 --> 01:18:34,380
Maybe I didn't
understand the book.

1168
01:18:35,848 --> 01:18:37,815
She just looks so pathetic.

1169
01:18:37,816 --> 01:18:41,520
Is she pretty?

1170
01:18:42,921 --> 01:18:44,956
Who?

1171
01:18:47,692 --> 01:18:49,226
Your wife.

1172
01:18:49,227 --> 01:18:51,228
Degrading yourself for nothing.

1173
01:18:51,229 --> 01:18:53,763
It's a simple question.

1174
01:18:53,764 --> 01:18:56,467
She's pretty, okay? Do we
have to talk about this now?

1175
01:18:58,269 --> 01:19:02,272
I mean, did she really think a man
like that was gonna run away with her?

1176
01:19:05,908 --> 01:19:08,745
Possibly.

1177
01:19:10,113 --> 01:19:12,113
How pretty is she?

1178
01:19:17,553 --> 01:19:19,555
A knockout.

1179
01:19:23,858 --> 01:19:26,194
Beauty's overrated, Sarah.

1180
01:19:30,831 --> 01:19:33,966
Brad had meant
this to be comforting.

1181
01:19:33,967 --> 01:19:38,172
But at 3:00 in the morning, it had
precisely the opposite effect.

1182
01:19:39,939 --> 01:19:42,007
He had a beautiful wife,

1183
01:19:42,008 --> 01:19:46,212
a knockout, and she was
sleeping beside him right now.

1184
01:19:47,480 --> 01:19:49,614
Only someone who took
his own beauty for granted

1185
01:19:49,615 --> 01:19:52,417
would have been able
to say something so stupid

1186
01:19:52,418 --> 01:19:54,720
and with a straight face.

1187
01:20:18,475 --> 01:20:21,310
Weekends were difficult
for Sarah.

1188
01:20:21,311 --> 01:20:22,844
48-hour prison stretches

1189
01:20:22,845 --> 01:20:25,980
separating one happy blur
of weekdays

1190
01:20:25,981 --> 01:20:28,083
from the rest.

1191
01:20:32,053 --> 01:20:33,354
I'm going to the ocean.

1192
01:20:33,355 --> 01:20:36,157
- You are?
- I'm going to the ocean.

1193
01:20:36,158 --> 01:20:38,626
Is he doing his ocean dance?

1194
01:20:42,963 --> 01:20:45,998
Sarah sometimes let herself
be carried away by fantasies

1195
01:20:45,999 --> 01:20:49,836
of a future very different from
the life she was living now,

1196
01:20:49,837 --> 01:20:52,305
in which she and Brad were
free to love each other

1197
01:20:52,306 --> 01:20:54,206
in broad daylight;

1198
01:20:54,207 --> 01:20:55,974
Where they had no one
to answer to

1199
01:20:55,975 --> 01:20:58,310
but each other.

1200
01:20:58,311 --> 01:21:01,947
It could happen,
she thought. It had to,

1201
01:21:01,948 --> 01:21:04,582
because she wasn't sure she
could keep living like this

1202
01:21:04,583 --> 01:21:07,386
for very much longer.

1203
01:21:13,825 --> 01:21:16,360
Open your mouth again.

1204
01:21:16,361 --> 01:21:19,329
No, I don't want to.

1205
01:21:19,330 --> 01:21:22,299
May your mouth be open.

1206
01:21:22,300 --> 01:21:24,334
May your mouth.

1207
01:21:24,335 --> 01:21:27,137
This is coming into your mouth.

1208
01:21:28,738 --> 01:21:31,707
Open your mouth, little fishy.

1209
01:21:31,708 --> 01:21:34,211
Hungry, hungry.

1210
01:21:35,412 --> 01:21:38,415
Little fishy is not hungry?

1211
01:21:41,116 --> 01:21:43,386
You okay?

1212
01:21:44,820 --> 01:21:47,323
Yeah, fine.

1213
01:21:48,924 --> 01:21:51,526
- How about you?
- Great.

1214
01:21:55,129 --> 01:21:57,365
So how was your weekend?

1215
01:22:00,202 --> 01:22:02,836
You really wanna know?
It sucked.

1216
01:22:04,905 --> 01:22:06,872
How was yours?

1217
01:22:06,873 --> 01:22:09,210
Terrible.

1218
01:22:10,043 --> 01:22:12,512
- Really?
- Yeah.

1219
01:22:14,146 --> 01:22:16,715
Yeah, we went to the beach
and all Kathy and I did

1220
01:22:16,716 --> 01:22:19,751
was argue the whole time.

1221
01:22:19,752 --> 01:22:23,256
Oh, you did?

1222
01:22:25,424 --> 01:22:27,425
Yeah, it was our annual argument

1223
01:22:27,426 --> 01:22:30,428
over taking the bar exam,

1224
01:22:30,429 --> 01:22:32,530
like our whole life
depends on it.

1225
01:22:32,531 --> 01:22:35,098
Get it over with.
You'll feel better.

1226
01:22:35,099 --> 01:22:37,267
It's this whole thing.

1227
01:22:37,268 --> 01:22:39,869
Gotta take a train on Wednesday.

1228
01:22:39,870 --> 01:22:42,605
It's a two-day ordeal.

1229
01:22:42,606 --> 01:22:45,141
I'm not even gonna pass.

1230
01:22:45,142 --> 01:22:47,743
- You'll be fine.
- No.

1231
01:22:47,744 --> 01:22:51,547
No, I won't.

1232
01:22:51,548 --> 01:22:54,251
I haven't cracked
a book all summer.

1233
01:23:03,158 --> 01:23:06,026
I missed you.

1234
01:23:06,027 --> 01:23:08,797
I missed you, too.

1235
01:23:14,034 --> 01:23:16,637
Don't... don't do it.

1236
01:23:17,505 --> 01:23:19,706
- What?
- The test.

1237
01:23:19,707 --> 01:23:22,508
- Oh.
- Blow it off.

1238
01:23:22,509 --> 01:23:25,143
We should go somewhere,

1239
01:23:25,144 --> 01:23:27,179
just for a night, you know?

1240
01:23:27,180 --> 01:23:28,847
Richard's out
of town till Friday,

1241
01:23:28,848 --> 01:23:31,351
and I'm sure I can get
a sitter for Lucy.

1242
01:23:35,053 --> 01:23:37,389
No, I can't do that.

1243
01:23:37,390 --> 01:23:40,293
I gotta take the test.

1244
01:23:50,968 --> 01:23:53,504
That's good.

1245
01:23:53,505 --> 01:23:55,938
- Looks good?
- Yeah.

1246
01:23:55,939 --> 01:23:57,973
Well, I have a good feeling
about this whole thing.

1247
01:23:57,974 --> 01:24:00,976
In fact, I think I'm gonna
go buy a bottle of champagne

1248
01:24:00,977 --> 01:24:03,479
and put it in the fridge, and
we can open it to celebrate

1249
01:24:03,480 --> 01:24:06,147
when we get the good news.

1250
01:24:06,148 --> 01:24:09,217
Don't get your hopes up.

1251
01:24:09,218 --> 01:24:11,219
We've been through this before.

1252
01:24:11,220 --> 01:24:14,255
Huh-uh. This time's
gonna be different.

1253
01:24:14,256 --> 01:24:17,859
I can feel it.

1254
01:24:46,719 --> 01:24:50,088
Can you believe it?
This is our first date.

1255
01:24:50,089 --> 01:24:53,491
Like a date, you know,
without the kids, I mean.

1256
01:24:53,492 --> 01:24:56,894
How was Lucy?
Did she cry or anything?

1257
01:24:56,895 --> 01:24:58,863
No, are you kidding?

1258
01:24:58,864 --> 01:25:01,900
With Jean there, she just
about shoved me out the door.

1259
01:25:06,103 --> 01:25:10,239
I thought we could make
something really beautiful.

1260
01:25:10,240 --> 01:25:13,410
I have so many things here.

1261
01:25:13,411 --> 01:25:16,178
We could make...

1262
01:25:16,179 --> 01:25:18,648
A picture frame.

1263
01:25:20,049 --> 01:25:24,053
Or a jewelry box.

1264
01:25:25,154 --> 01:25:29,358
Or a hat.

1265
01:25:31,126 --> 01:25:34,295
Something for my mommy.

1266
01:25:34,296 --> 01:25:36,499
Okay.

1267
01:25:38,866 --> 01:25:40,501
- Stop it, stop it.
- No, Ronnie.

1268
01:25:40,502 --> 01:25:43,236
Ron... Ron... Ronnie,
just hold on.

1269
01:25:43,237 --> 01:25:46,206
Now there.

1270
01:25:46,207 --> 01:25:49,809
You look handsome.
She won't be disappointed.

1271
01:25:49,810 --> 01:25:52,878
Wait'll she hears
about my criminal record.

1272
01:25:52,879 --> 01:25:55,347
I don't think you need
to get into that just yet.

1273
01:25:55,348 --> 01:25:57,550
Why don't you stick
to small talk?

1274
01:25:57,551 --> 01:26:00,351
What if someone recognizes me?

1275
01:26:00,352 --> 01:26:03,955
That's highly unlikely. I
made the dinner reservation

1276
01:26:03,956 --> 01:26:06,558
at a restaurant over
in haverhill.

1277
01:26:23,474 --> 01:26:25,676
Sheila.

1278
01:26:27,778 --> 01:26:30,448
- Sheila.
- Yeah.

1279
01:26:33,650 --> 01:26:36,419
Something wrong with the food?

1280
01:26:37,854 --> 01:26:39,921
No, it's fine.

1281
01:26:39,922 --> 01:26:44,060
Back at the house you mentioned
you were on medication.

1282
01:26:46,394 --> 01:26:50,030
- What kind?
- All kinds.

1283
01:26:50,031 --> 01:26:52,033
Mostly psychotropic.

1284
01:26:54,936 --> 01:26:58,505
So you had some kind
of a breakdown?

1285
01:26:58,506 --> 01:27:02,341
Mm-hmm, my junior year
in college.

1286
01:27:02,342 --> 01:27:04,612
You were that young?

1287
01:27:06,413 --> 01:27:08,547
What happened?

1288
01:27:08,548 --> 01:27:11,116
I don't really know.

1289
01:27:11,117 --> 01:27:14,654
Well, nervous breakdowns don't
just come out of nowhere.

1290
01:27:15,689 --> 01:27:18,190
Something must have caused it.

1291
01:27:18,191 --> 01:27:20,725
I guess.

1292
01:27:20,726 --> 01:27:23,896
But I was fine before
I left for college.

1293
01:27:25,397 --> 01:27:27,699
I don't know.
Maybe it was the stress

1294
01:27:27,700 --> 01:27:29,601
of being on my own.

1295
01:27:29,602 --> 01:27:32,235
Maybe it's a chemical
imbalance in my brain.

1296
01:27:32,236 --> 01:27:35,706
Every psychiatrist I go to
has a different opinion.

1297
01:27:35,707 --> 01:27:38,842
This one guy, Dr. faris,

1298
01:27:38,843 --> 01:27:42,712
he said I must have been
sexually abused as a child.

1299
01:27:42,713 --> 01:27:44,379
When I told him I wasn't,

1300
01:27:44,380 --> 01:27:46,882
he said I must be
repressing the memory.

1301
01:27:46,883 --> 01:27:50,753
Right, um, so what
happened after that?

1302
01:27:50,754 --> 01:27:52,688
Did you drop out of school?

1303
01:27:52,689 --> 01:27:55,590
Not right away.

1304
01:27:55,591 --> 01:27:57,726
My mother wanted me to go

1305
01:27:57,727 --> 01:27:59,628
to the campus counseling center.

1306
01:27:59,629 --> 01:28:02,263
And they wanted the problem
fixed, like I could just

1307
01:28:02,264 --> 01:28:05,465
snap my fingers and everything
would be okay again.

1308
01:28:05,466 --> 01:28:08,035
Yeah, I know all about that.

1309
01:28:08,036 --> 01:28:11,471
You do?

1310
01:28:11,472 --> 01:28:15,076
Yes, I do.

1311
01:28:17,945 --> 01:28:21,548
So they said
I could leave school

1312
01:28:21,549 --> 01:28:24,551
and get married and have lots
of kids like my sisters,

1313
01:28:24,552 --> 01:28:26,686
and I can't take care of kids.

1314
01:28:26,687 --> 01:28:29,020
I can't even take care of myself

1315
01:28:29,021 --> 01:28:32,357
most of the time. Besides,
who's gonna marry me?

1316
01:28:32,358 --> 01:28:35,961
You're not so bad.

1317
01:28:35,962 --> 01:28:37,964
What?

1318
01:28:38,930 --> 01:28:41,800
You're... you're not so bad.

1319
01:28:47,238 --> 01:28:49,839
I haven't had a real
boyfriend in six years,

1320
01:28:49,840 --> 01:28:52,909
not since my second breakdown.

1321
01:28:52,910 --> 01:28:55,545
I had this thing happen
on a greyhound bus.

1322
01:28:55,546 --> 01:28:59,082
- I was...
- Do you want me to wrap that up?

1323
01:28:59,083 --> 01:29:01,684
Oh, no, thank you.

1324
01:29:01,685 --> 01:29:04,587
No, wrap it up, please.
I'll take it home.

1325
01:29:04,588 --> 01:29:07,122
Folks gonna want dessert?

1326
01:29:07,123 --> 01:29:10,594
What do you say, Sheila? You
wanna share something sweet?

1327
01:29:15,430 --> 01:29:17,799
Let's make a little stop.

1328
01:29:17,800 --> 01:29:19,868
Take the next left.

1329
01:29:26,407 --> 01:29:29,010
Turn off the lights.

1330
01:29:36,449 --> 01:29:38,752
I had a nice time tonight.

1331
01:29:45,592 --> 01:29:48,259
The last guy I went out with,

1332
01:29:48,260 --> 01:29:50,161
you know what he did?

1333
01:29:50,162 --> 01:29:52,864
He ditched me.

1334
01:29:52,865 --> 01:29:56,134
He got up to go
to the men's room,

1335
01:29:56,135 --> 01:29:58,169
never came back.

1336
01:29:59,638 --> 01:30:03,440
Stuck me with the check.

1337
01:30:03,441 --> 01:30:05,843
Never said goodbye.

1338
01:30:05,844 --> 01:30:08,946
Never called to apologize.

1339
01:30:08,947 --> 01:30:12,381
He wasn't my type anyway.
He was a big-shot cpa.

1340
01:30:12,382 --> 01:30:16,186
Super normal guy. Didn't want
to be dating some psycho.

1341
01:30:23,760 --> 01:30:26,162
But you seem like a nice person.

1342
01:30:54,821 --> 01:30:57,857
Better not tell on me.

1343
01:31:01,094 --> 01:31:03,096
You hear me?

1344
01:31:06,531 --> 01:31:09,634
You better not tell,
or I'll fucking get you.

1345
01:32:10,090 --> 01:32:12,759
Hold on, mom. Hold on, dad.

1346
01:32:12,760 --> 01:32:16,694
You should park the car on
the escalator, and back...

1347
01:32:16,695 --> 01:32:19,030
- So?
- What?

1348
01:32:19,031 --> 01:32:23,034
- Up, down and then up.
- Test, dummy. How'd it go?

1349
01:32:23,035 --> 01:32:25,237
It was all right.

1350
01:32:27,138 --> 01:32:29,439
You didn't call home last night.

1351
01:32:29,440 --> 01:32:30,975
I was worried.

1352
01:32:30,976 --> 01:32:33,077
Go on the escalator.

1353
01:32:33,078 --> 01:32:35,313
Guess I could really use
that cell phone.

1354
01:32:36,581 --> 01:32:38,982
Go on the escalator.

1355
01:32:38,983 --> 01:32:41,451
Go on the escalator.

1356
01:33:10,045 --> 01:33:12,913
- Well, look who's back.
- Oh, hi.

1357
01:33:12,914 --> 01:33:15,415
Hi, Jean.

1358
01:33:15,416 --> 01:33:17,417
Thanks.

1359
01:33:17,418 --> 01:33:19,185
You're a lifesaver.

1360
01:33:19,186 --> 01:33:21,387
So how was your old roommate?

1361
01:33:21,388 --> 01:33:22,554
Oh, great.

1362
01:33:22,555 --> 01:33:25,457
Yeah, thanks for doing this
on such short notice.

1363
01:33:25,458 --> 01:33:28,994
Let me give you something
for your time.

1364
01:33:28,995 --> 01:33:31,263
That's not necessary.

1365
01:33:31,264 --> 01:33:34,967
No, really. I insist.

1366
01:33:36,035 --> 01:33:37,937
Please don't.

1367
01:33:40,906 --> 01:33:42,640
Okay.

1368
01:33:42,641 --> 01:33:44,909
Uh, any calls?

1369
01:33:44,910 --> 01:33:46,409
Nope, it was very quiet.

1370
01:33:46,410 --> 01:33:50,013
She's asleep on your bed.
It was a very busy day.

1371
01:33:50,014 --> 01:33:51,915
That's great.

1372
01:33:51,916 --> 01:33:55,153
Um, Jean, is everything okay?

1373
01:33:58,321 --> 01:34:01,158
Yeah, she's a wonderful child.

1374
01:34:20,375 --> 01:34:22,377
Mommy.

1375
01:34:33,387 --> 01:34:35,389
Mommy!

1376
01:34:36,523 --> 01:34:38,024
Yeah.

1377
01:34:38,025 --> 01:34:40,560
Are you coming?

1378
01:34:44,097 --> 01:34:47,732
- I have something.
- What?

1379
01:34:47,733 --> 01:34:50,036
I have something for you.

1380
01:34:54,039 --> 01:34:56,508
Just give me
a second here, okay?

1381
01:35:24,234 --> 01:35:26,336
Brad.

1382
01:35:30,739 --> 01:35:33,342
Brad.

1383
01:35:34,409 --> 01:35:36,411
Hmm.

1384
01:35:37,779 --> 01:35:41,215
Aaron's been telling me
about his new friend Lucy.

1385
01:35:42,016 --> 01:35:44,919
She sounds like
a sweet little girl.

1386
01:35:46,120 --> 01:35:48,356
What's her mother like?

1387
01:35:52,625 --> 01:35:55,727
Nice enough, I guess.

1388
01:35:55,728 --> 01:35:58,465
I can't even remember her name.

1389
01:36:02,101 --> 01:36:04,403
Isn't it Sarah?

1390
01:36:05,704 --> 01:36:08,506
Sarah?

1391
01:36:08,507 --> 01:36:10,808
Yeah, Sarah,

1392
01:36:10,809 --> 01:36:12,343
from the pool.

1393
01:36:12,344 --> 01:36:15,579
Her daughter's name is Lucy.

1394
01:36:15,580 --> 01:36:18,148
Oh, Lucy's mom. Yeah, I forgot.
That's right.

1395
01:36:18,149 --> 01:36:20,985
Her name is Sarah.

1396
01:36:20,986 --> 01:36:24,187
Hmm.

1397
01:36:24,188 --> 01:36:26,322
Yeah, it might be
really nice for Aaron

1398
01:36:26,323 --> 01:36:29,693
if they came over for dinner.

1399
01:36:33,663 --> 01:36:35,965
Okay.

1400
01:36:58,519 --> 01:37:01,221
So you're in advertising?

1401
01:37:01,222 --> 01:37:03,889
No, that's... that's
a common misconception.

1402
01:37:03,890 --> 01:37:06,126
I'm... I'm not in advertising.
I'm in branding.

1403
01:37:06,127 --> 01:37:08,228
And that's... that's
very different.

1404
01:37:08,229 --> 01:37:10,362
Richard's pretty high up
in the company.

1405
01:37:10,363 --> 01:37:12,364
Yeah, yeah, I have these clients

1406
01:37:12,365 --> 01:37:14,233
and they'll come to me
when they have,

1407
01:37:14,234 --> 01:37:16,268
you know, a new product
they wanna sell.

1408
01:37:16,269 --> 01:37:19,804
Like, um, these guys, they
were in a couple weeks ago.

1409
01:37:19,805 --> 01:37:22,906
Th... they're trying to open this
chain of Chinese restaurants, right?

1410
01:37:22,907 --> 01:37:26,477
And they're talking to me and
I... I look down at the table

1411
01:37:26,478 --> 01:37:30,848
and I realize that none of
these guys were Chinese. Hmm?

1412
01:37:30,849 --> 01:37:32,115
Where were they from?

1413
01:37:32,116 --> 01:37:33,850
They're a bunch of fat cats
from Tennessee.

1414
01:37:33,851 --> 01:37:36,853
They think they can start a chain
of Chinese restaurants good enough

1415
01:37:36,854 --> 01:37:38,855
to fool the average
American boob.

1416
01:37:38,856 --> 01:37:40,890
Oh, god.

1417
01:37:40,891 --> 01:37:43,392
Mmm!

1418
01:37:43,393 --> 01:37:45,594
- This is delicious.
- Isn't it?

1419
01:37:45,595 --> 01:37:48,097
Brad's a fantastic cook.

1420
01:37:48,098 --> 01:37:51,400
So you guys see these
fliers with the guy's face

1421
01:37:51,401 --> 01:37:53,069
plastered all over our village?

1422
01:37:53,070 --> 01:37:56,003
Lots of sturm und drang in
our quiet little town, huh?

1423
01:37:56,004 --> 01:37:57,738
Yeah, it's crazy.

1424
01:37:57,739 --> 01:38:00,241
What I want to know is why they let
a creep like that out of prison.

1425
01:38:00,242 --> 01:38:02,943
Some of the people going
after him are just as crazy.

1426
01:38:02,944 --> 01:38:06,146
- What do you mean?
- Well, just today I heard that

1427
01:38:06,147 --> 01:38:08,282
some nut's been spray-painting
the poor guy's house,

1428
01:38:08,283 --> 01:38:11,518
lighting fires on his porch.
God knows what else.

1429
01:38:11,519 --> 01:38:13,520
- Do they know who's doing it?
- Huh-uh.

1430
01:38:13,521 --> 01:38:15,522
They think it's some ex-cop.

1431
01:38:15,523 --> 01:38:17,590
You know, that guy who
killed that kid at the mall.

1432
01:38:17,591 --> 01:38:19,425
Yeah, I don't think it's him.

1433
01:38:19,426 --> 01:38:22,261
You're biased. You're
friends with the guy.

1434
01:38:22,262 --> 01:38:25,498
Well, Brad's on that committee
of concerned parents

1435
01:38:25,499 --> 01:38:27,032
with him.

1436
01:38:27,033 --> 01:38:28,933
I didn't know you were on that.

1437
01:38:28,934 --> 01:38:31,369
I play on his football team.

1438
01:38:31,370 --> 01:38:34,772
He asked me to distribute
some fliers.

1439
01:38:34,773 --> 01:38:36,874
He's on your team.

1440
01:38:36,875 --> 01:38:39,844
You never told me that.

1441
01:38:39,845 --> 01:38:41,579
Yeah.

1442
01:38:43,481 --> 01:38:47,384
You know what's weird? I've
never even seen this mcgorvey guy.

1443
01:38:47,385 --> 01:38:49,620
- We did.
- No, we didn't.

1444
01:38:49,621 --> 01:38:51,654
Not you. Me and Brad.

1445
01:38:51,655 --> 01:38:54,924
That day at the pool, remember?

1446
01:38:54,925 --> 01:38:58,329
Yeah, I-i totally forgot.

1447
01:38:59,996 --> 01:39:03,398
- Well, what happened?
- Sexual tension is an elusive thing,

1448
01:39:03,399 --> 01:39:05,700
but Kathy had
pretty good radar for it.

1449
01:39:05,701 --> 01:39:09,204
It was like someone had turned
a knob a hair to the right,

1450
01:39:09,205 --> 01:39:12,073
and the radio station
clicked in so loud and clear

1451
01:39:12,074 --> 01:39:14,742
it almost knocked her over.

1452
01:39:14,743 --> 01:39:17,111
Once she became aware of the
connection between them,

1453
01:39:17,112 --> 01:39:20,448
it seemed impossible that
she'd missed it before.

1454
01:39:20,449 --> 01:39:22,983
On a hunch,
Kathy dropped her fork

1455
01:39:22,984 --> 01:39:25,153
in the hopes that
while retrieving it

1456
01:39:25,154 --> 01:39:28,488
she would catch Sarah
and Brad playing footsie,

1457
01:39:28,489 --> 01:39:31,023
- but she was mistaken.
- Asked him to leave, and he left.

1458
01:39:31,024 --> 01:39:34,261
But you know what? He didn't
look scary, right? I mean...

1459
01:39:34,262 --> 01:39:37,163
No, it... it wasn't that
big of a deal, you know.

1460
01:39:37,164 --> 01:39:40,132
- No, he's like a regular guy, you know?
- Yeah, I mean...

1461
01:39:40,133 --> 01:39:42,201
Kathy, are you okay?

1462
01:39:42,202 --> 01:39:44,136
Uh, yeah.

1463
01:39:44,137 --> 01:39:47,273
Just a sec.

1464
01:39:47,274 --> 01:39:48,839
Brad had convinced himself

1465
01:39:48,840 --> 01:39:51,242
the dinner party had gone well.

1466
01:39:51,243 --> 01:39:55,112
That he and Sarah had managed to
put Kathy's suspicions to rest,

1467
01:39:55,113 --> 01:39:57,081
at least temporarily.

1468
01:39:57,082 --> 01:39:59,484
She certainly hadn't
accused him of anything,

1469
01:39:59,485 --> 01:40:01,485
or behaved in a way
that made him think

1470
01:40:01,486 --> 01:40:03,721
she'd noticed anything untoward.

1471
01:40:08,693 --> 01:40:12,496
I'm really glad they came over.

1472
01:40:18,134 --> 01:40:21,069
- Good night.
- Good night.

1473
01:40:21,070 --> 01:40:22,670
Two days later, however,

1474
01:40:22,671 --> 01:40:24,939
his mother-in-law showed up
for a surprise visit...

1475
01:40:24,940 --> 01:40:27,942
- Thank you, John. -...Of
ominously indeterminate length.

1476
01:40:27,943 --> 01:40:31,012
And from that moment on,
she accompanied Brad

1477
01:40:31,013 --> 01:40:32,847
AND AARON EVERYWHERE:

1478
01:40:32,848 --> 01:40:34,548
To the playground;

1479
01:40:34,549 --> 01:40:37,551
- We need some butter.
- To the supermarket;

1480
01:40:37,552 --> 01:40:40,153
And to the town pool.

1481
01:40:40,154 --> 01:40:42,923
Hi, Aaron.

1482
01:40:42,924 --> 01:40:46,327
Hi, Lucy.

1483
01:40:47,528 --> 01:40:50,363
The worst of it was the pool.

1484
01:40:50,364 --> 01:40:52,965
Nevertheless,
after threatening all week

1485
01:40:52,966 --> 01:40:56,401
to go the football game, Brad's
mother-in-law decided against it

1486
01:40:56,402 --> 01:40:58,403
at the last minute.

1487
01:40:58,404 --> 01:41:00,472
- So are you coming?
- Well, I'd like to,

1488
01:41:00,473 --> 01:41:02,474
but I'm a little tired.

1489
01:41:02,475 --> 01:41:04,776
You sure? You're welcome to.

1490
01:41:04,777 --> 01:41:06,778
No, go ahead. You and Aaron

1491
01:41:06,779 --> 01:41:09,012
sure kept me hopping
this afternoon.

1492
01:41:09,013 --> 01:41:11,315
Looks like you're on your own.

1493
01:41:11,316 --> 01:41:14,117
Oh, that's my ride.

1494
01:41:14,118 --> 01:41:17,154
- What time are you gonna be home?
- I don't know.

1495
01:41:17,155 --> 01:41:18,756
Pretty late, though.

1496
01:41:18,757 --> 01:41:21,925
Be careful and stay
out of trouble.

1497
01:41:34,871 --> 01:41:37,473
Winds whisper of high hopes,

1498
01:41:37,474 --> 01:41:39,608
victory is in the skies.

1499
01:41:39,609 --> 01:41:42,943
One joins with many
on the summer's green field.

1500
01:41:42,944 --> 01:41:46,113
At 0 and 5, the guardians
were the basement dwellers

1501
01:41:46,114 --> 01:41:49,016
of the tri-county
touch football night league.

1502
01:41:49,017 --> 01:41:52,920
The controllers, a team of young
hotshots from the financial district

1503
01:41:52,921 --> 01:41:55,889
were 4 and 1
with an explosive offense

1504
01:41:55,890 --> 01:41:59,326
that regularly racked up
40 to 50 points a game.

1505
01:41:59,327 --> 01:42:01,261
But from the opening kickoff,

1506
01:42:01,262 --> 01:42:04,897
this ragtag group
of law enforcement officers

1507
01:42:04,898 --> 01:42:07,434
decided to crunch
their own numbers.

1508
01:42:10,804 --> 01:42:13,071
But the controllers scored first

1509
01:42:13,072 --> 01:42:15,308
after recovering
a Bart Williams fumble

1510
01:42:15,309 --> 01:42:19,445
deep in guardians' territory near
the end of the second quarter.

1511
01:42:23,682 --> 01:42:27,319
The guardians evened things up
early in the second half...

1512
01:42:28,786 --> 01:42:31,221
Moving methodically downfield

1513
01:42:31,222 --> 01:42:33,591
on an 80-yard touchdown drive.

1514
01:42:38,229 --> 01:42:41,664
The controllers regained the lead
with a fourth quarter field goal.

1515
01:42:41,665 --> 01:42:45,200
With less than a minute
to go, trailing by three,

1516
01:42:45,201 --> 01:42:47,437
the guardians faced
the extinction of their hopes.

1517
01:42:47,438 --> 01:42:49,904
- Down!
- It was their last chance...

1518
01:42:49,905 --> 01:42:52,507
4th and 5 on their own 35.

1519
01:42:52,508 --> 01:42:55,377
Set!

1520
01:42:55,378 --> 01:42:58,348
Hut, hut!

1521
01:43:30,777 --> 01:43:34,112
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

1522
01:43:34,113 --> 01:43:37,314
Yeah, yeah!

1523
01:43:37,315 --> 01:43:39,651
Yeah, yeah!

1524
01:43:40,852 --> 01:43:43,589
Yeah!

1525
01:43:44,456 --> 01:43:46,156
Oh my god!

1526
01:43:46,157 --> 01:43:49,360
Yeah!

1527
01:43:59,068 --> 01:44:02,406
Brad, Brad!

1528
01:44:03,272 --> 01:44:04,973
What do you want?

1529
01:44:04,974 --> 01:44:08,577
Everyone is waiting for us at the bar.
Are... are... are you coming?

1530
01:44:08,578 --> 01:44:10,745
Why don't you go on ahead?
I'll catch up later.

1531
01:44:10,746 --> 01:44:13,481
You're gonna come, right?
I mean, we gotta celebrate.

1532
01:44:13,482 --> 01:44:15,116
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'll be there.

1533
01:44:15,117 --> 01:44:18,319
- You promise?
- Jesus, Larry, I just told you.

1534
01:44:18,320 --> 01:44:21,789
- Well, you got a ride?
- Yeah.

1535
01:44:23,324 --> 01:44:25,726
Okay.

1536
01:44:25,727 --> 01:44:27,995
I'll have a cold one
waiting for you.

1537
01:44:31,899 --> 01:44:33,899
Larry, you have to go home now.

1538
01:44:33,900 --> 01:44:36,201
Just give me five more minutes.
He promised he was coming.

1539
01:44:36,202 --> 01:44:39,304
I don't care what he
promised, I want to lock up.

1540
01:44:39,305 --> 01:44:41,441
Now get your butt out of here!

1541
01:44:41,442 --> 01:44:44,376
Now!

1542
01:44:50,182 --> 01:44:54,918
When I looked up there
and saw you it was just...

1543
01:44:54,919 --> 01:44:59,022
Wow... wow.

1544
01:44:59,023 --> 01:45:02,493
Thank god you came.

1545
01:45:02,494 --> 01:45:05,729
I don't want to go home.

1546
01:45:05,730 --> 01:45:09,065
I want to stay
right here forever.

1547
01:45:09,066 --> 01:45:10,967
No, I do. For the
first time in my life

1548
01:45:10,968 --> 01:45:14,003
I feel like anything is possible.
Like I can do anything, you know?

1549
01:45:18,407 --> 01:45:20,676
What are we doing?

1550
01:45:20,677 --> 01:45:24,412
What do you mean?

1551
01:45:24,413 --> 01:45:27,483
It's not real, Brad.

1552
01:45:27,484 --> 01:45:29,316
What?

1553
01:45:29,317 --> 01:45:32,086
This. It's wrong and it's weird.

1554
01:45:32,087 --> 01:45:33,888
How long are we gonna
sneak around together?

1555
01:45:33,889 --> 01:45:36,156
How long can that last?
I can't do this anymore.

1556
01:45:36,157 --> 01:45:37,592
No, no don't say that.

1557
01:45:37,593 --> 01:45:41,294
As long as I know that
we're gonna have this...

1558
01:45:41,295 --> 01:45:42,862
Have what?

1559
01:45:42,863 --> 01:45:45,699
What is this?

1560
01:45:45,700 --> 01:45:47,901
Look...

1561
01:45:47,902 --> 01:45:50,770
If that dinner at your
house was any indication,

1562
01:45:50,771 --> 01:45:53,706
you seem pretty happy
with your wife.

1563
01:45:53,707 --> 01:45:55,574
You know, you have
a perfect life

1564
01:45:55,575 --> 01:45:57,677
- and I don't wanna to be the...
- Listen, stop, stop, stop.

1565
01:45:59,779 --> 01:46:02,914
Run away with me.

1566
01:46:02,915 --> 01:46:04,817
What?

1567
01:46:06,919 --> 01:46:09,286
You don't... you don't
mean that.

1568
01:46:09,287 --> 01:46:14,091
You believe in me.

1569
01:46:14,092 --> 01:46:16,459
Come on.

1570
01:46:16,460 --> 01:46:19,596
We'll go away,
figure this thing out.

1571
01:46:19,597 --> 01:46:22,799
It's not weird.

1572
01:46:22,800 --> 01:46:25,801
The kids are comfortable
with each other.

1573
01:46:25,802 --> 01:46:29,138
I know there's more
to it than that, but...

1574
01:46:29,139 --> 01:46:31,674
Let's do this.

1575
01:46:31,675 --> 01:46:35,178
Please. Please, Sarah.

1576
01:46:37,513 --> 01:46:40,414
Oh my god.

1577
01:46:40,415 --> 01:46:44,052
You really mean it, don't you?

1578
01:46:44,053 --> 01:46:46,689
Yes.

1579
01:46:48,456 --> 01:46:52,159
Okay.

1580
01:46:52,160 --> 01:46:54,728
Okay. Okay. Yes!

1581
01:46:54,729 --> 01:46:57,598
Yes! Okay, yes.

1582
01:47:00,968 --> 01:47:04,571
Fucking Brad, I'm so
sick of hearing about Brad.

1583
01:47:04,572 --> 01:47:07,106
I'm fucking over it.

1584
01:47:07,107 --> 01:47:10,577
I don't even like him.
He's a loser.

1585
01:47:10,578 --> 01:47:12,210
"Brad made
the fucking touchdown."

1586
01:47:12,211 --> 01:47:14,112
Yeah, you know why he hasn't
the balls to show up here?

1587
01:47:14,113 --> 01:47:17,315
'Cause I fucking made the block.
It's bullshit.

1588
01:47:17,316 --> 01:47:20,251
That's why he's not even here, he's
fucking embarrassed to see me.

1589
01:47:20,252 --> 01:47:25,123
I don't even like anybody
in this fucking town.

1590
01:47:37,702 --> 01:47:40,036
Wake up, wake up!

1591
01:47:40,037 --> 01:47:43,306
Wake up, woodward court!

1592
01:47:43,307 --> 01:47:45,073
Okay, I'm awake.

1593
01:47:45,074 --> 01:47:49,477
Open your eyes! Get your
goddamn heads out of the sand!

1594
01:47:49,478 --> 01:47:51,814
My heads? My goddamn heads?

1595
01:47:51,815 --> 01:47:53,882
Don't you people
love your children?

1596
01:47:53,883 --> 01:47:57,018
Don't you want
to protect them from evil?

1597
01:47:57,019 --> 01:48:00,154
Woodward court, there's a
pervert in your midst!

1598
01:48:00,155 --> 01:48:02,924
There's a goddamn
pervert in your midst!

1599
01:48:02,925 --> 01:48:06,160
Open your eyes!
Protect the children!

1600
01:48:06,161 --> 01:48:07,994
Save the children!

1601
01:48:07,995 --> 01:48:10,831
Wake up and see the grass!
Open your eyes...

1602
01:48:10,832 --> 01:48:12,966
- Just stay inside, Ronnie.
- Save the children!

1603
01:48:12,967 --> 01:48:14,835
Open your goddamn eyes!

1604
01:48:14,836 --> 01:48:17,570
Wake up and save your children!

1605
01:48:17,571 --> 01:48:21,506
You dirty son of a bitch!
Get off my lawn!

1606
01:48:21,507 --> 01:48:24,777
Who the hell do you think you are, Mr.
High and mighty?

1607
01:48:24,778 --> 01:48:27,112
No perverts in woodward court!

1608
01:48:27,113 --> 01:48:29,081
No perverts in woodward court!

1609
01:48:29,082 --> 01:48:30,849
You think you're god?
Far from it!

1610
01:48:30,850 --> 01:48:33,184
I don't think I'm god!
I never said I was!

1611
01:48:33,185 --> 01:48:35,286
You murderer, you
killed the boy.

1612
01:48:35,287 --> 01:48:37,656
I didn't murder anyone. Now why don't you
go back inside, put some clothes on?

1613
01:48:37,657 --> 01:48:39,791
You shot him through the neck.
I read it in the paper.

1614
01:48:39,792 --> 01:48:42,893
- No perverts in...
- You son of a bitch. Give me that.

1615
01:48:42,894 --> 01:48:45,395
Hey hey!

1616
01:48:45,396 --> 01:48:46,697
Give me that! You're...

1617
01:48:46,698 --> 01:48:48,531
- You need to go home.
- The police are coming.

1618
01:48:48,532 --> 01:48:49,867
I mean, you're scaring my kids.

1619
01:48:49,868 --> 01:48:52,102
Your kids need to be frightened!

1620
01:48:52,103 --> 01:48:53,936
They live across
the street from a pervert!

1621
01:48:56,006 --> 01:48:57,840
Ow! Oh!

1622
01:48:57,841 --> 01:49:00,877
Oh my god, Mrs. mcgorvey.
Are you okay?

1623
01:49:02,579 --> 01:49:05,914
May. May!

1624
01:49:05,915 --> 01:49:08,216
May... I think we should
call an ambulance.

1625
01:49:08,217 --> 01:49:10,686
Karen, call an
ambulance, right now!

1626
01:49:10,687 --> 01:49:12,888
- I'm doing it!
- Oh, fuck.

1627
01:49:12,889 --> 01:49:17,725
- May!
- This is all I need.

1628
01:49:25,166 --> 01:49:28,368
Excuse me, Mr. mcgorvey, we
need to ask you some questions.

1629
01:50:05,269 --> 01:50:07,939
$14.35.

1630
01:50:20,050 --> 01:50:22,752
The fed continuing
its campaign against inflation

1631
01:50:22,753 --> 01:50:26,520
by raising short-term interest
rates for the 10th time yesterday.

1632
01:50:26,521 --> 01:50:30,191
Usually there is a correlation
between inflation and gold prices.

1633
01:50:30,192 --> 01:50:33,327
Let's take you over
to our stocks desk...

1634
01:50:33,328 --> 01:50:37,697
Cafe con leche?

1635
01:50:37,698 --> 01:50:39,466
Thank you.

1636
01:50:42,904 --> 01:50:47,139
Kim Bryson,
please call the operator.

1637
01:50:47,140 --> 01:50:50,277
Kim Bryson, please call
the operator.

1638
01:50:53,080 --> 01:50:54,314
Madre.

1639
01:50:57,484 --> 01:51:01,453
Me too. She's resting.

1640
01:51:45,560 --> 01:51:47,829
Get down, knock it off!

1641
01:51:47,830 --> 01:51:49,763
Quiet.

1642
01:51:49,764 --> 01:51:52,733
Bring him around.

1643
01:52:01,342 --> 01:52:03,277
It's all yours.

1644
01:52:51,421 --> 01:52:53,322
Mr. mcgorvey.

1645
01:52:54,456 --> 01:52:58,026
Mr. mcgorvey.

1646
01:52:58,027 --> 01:53:01,030
I'm afraid we
have some bad news.

1647
01:53:02,164 --> 01:53:05,000
Do you have a mortuary
to make arrangements for you?

1648
01:53:06,801 --> 01:53:10,938
It's not a problem. The hospital has
a list that I can provide you with.

1649
01:53:10,939 --> 01:53:13,073
Here's what's going to happen:

1650
01:53:13,074 --> 01:53:15,808
Your mother's body
will remain in her bed

1651
01:53:15,809 --> 01:53:17,576
for up to three hours.

1652
01:53:17,577 --> 01:53:19,612
Three hours is typical.

1653
01:53:19,613 --> 01:53:23,349
But if there's a request for more
time, depending on our occupancy,

1654
01:53:23,350 --> 01:53:25,518
that's usually not a problem.

1655
01:53:25,519 --> 01:53:29,521
If there's anyone
you need to call...

1656
01:53:29,522 --> 01:53:31,589
Family, friends...

1657
01:53:31,590 --> 01:53:34,226
They're welcome to full
bedside visitation privileges

1658
01:53:34,227 --> 01:53:36,161
before the body is taken
downstairs

1659
01:53:36,162 --> 01:53:38,896
to be prepped for transport.

1660
01:53:38,897 --> 01:53:42,234
Do you have any questions
that come to mind?

1661
01:53:46,972 --> 01:53:48,906
Anything I can help you with?

1662
01:53:51,875 --> 01:53:53,876
- No.
- Okay.

1663
01:53:53,877 --> 01:53:56,846
I'd like to remind you to take your
mother's personal belongings with you

1664
01:53:56,847 --> 01:53:59,049
before you leave
the hospital today.

1665
01:53:59,050 --> 01:54:00,482
And all I need from you now

1666
01:54:00,483 --> 01:54:03,954
is to sign this release-
of-remains form.

1667
01:58:13,147 --> 01:58:15,149
Aaron.

1668
01:58:17,985 --> 01:58:20,819
Hey, hey, buddy.

1669
01:58:20,820 --> 01:58:24,857
Can you wake up?

1670
01:58:28,661 --> 01:58:32,163
Could you take your
hat off for me?

1671
01:58:32,164 --> 01:58:35,201
Just for a second.

1672
01:58:40,272 --> 01:58:43,140
Are you mad at me, daddy?

1673
01:58:43,141 --> 01:58:47,377
No. No, no, no, not at all.

1674
01:58:47,378 --> 01:58:51,415
I just want you to know

1675
01:58:51,416 --> 01:58:54,351
that I love you very much,

1676
01:58:54,352 --> 01:58:59,154
and I would never do
anything to hurt you, okay?

1677
01:58:59,155 --> 01:59:01,891
Okay.

1678
01:59:08,130 --> 01:59:11,400
Now you can go back to sleep.

1679
02:00:10,688 --> 02:00:14,623
Lucy, come on.

1680
02:00:14,624 --> 02:00:17,393
Let's go.

1681
02:00:17,394 --> 02:00:20,196
I will not go in the car seat!

1682
02:00:21,698 --> 02:00:25,200
- You have to go in the car...
- I will not go in the car seat!

1683
02:00:25,201 --> 02:00:27,735
- Yes, you will! You will go in the car seat.
- No, I won't!

1684
02:00:27,736 --> 02:00:29,337
Yes, you will.
Go in the car seat.

1685
02:00:29,338 --> 02:00:33,674
I will not go in the car seat!

1686
02:00:33,675 --> 02:00:35,311
Okay, just...

1687
02:00:37,945 --> 02:00:39,613
You don't have to
go in the car seat.

1688
02:00:39,614 --> 02:00:42,181
You can just go here.
No, actually...

1689
02:00:42,182 --> 02:00:43,783
Go on the floor. Okay.

1690
02:00:43,784 --> 02:00:46,052
Okay, go down on the floor.
You have to stay down, okay?

1691
02:00:46,053 --> 02:00:48,987
Mommy is gonna get arrested.
Just stay down, okay?

1692
02:00:48,988 --> 02:00:50,122
Okay.

1693
02:01:08,674 --> 02:01:12,543
Mommy, I want to go home.

1694
02:01:12,544 --> 02:01:15,278
Yeah, in a minute,

1695
02:01:15,279 --> 02:01:17,482
as soon as Brad gets here.

1696
02:01:31,227 --> 02:01:33,829
Hello?

1697
02:01:36,298 --> 02:01:40,035
Ronnie?

1698
02:02:07,194 --> 02:02:09,596
Oh my god.

1699
02:02:24,843 --> 02:02:27,946
- Are you all right?
- Yeah! Let's do it. Let's go!

1700
02:02:30,416 --> 02:02:33,116
Hey, dude!

1701
02:02:33,117 --> 02:02:36,420
What's the hurry?

1702
02:02:39,690 --> 02:02:43,191
Yeah! Oh!

1703
02:02:43,192 --> 02:02:46,829
- That is so sick.
- Damn.

1704
02:02:46,830 --> 02:02:48,697
- Nice.
- Oh, man.

1705
02:02:48,698 --> 02:02:51,400
Yeah, man.

1706
02:02:51,401 --> 02:02:52,901
- How about you take a run?
- What?

1707
02:02:52,902 --> 02:02:55,470
Yeah, give it a shot.
See what happens.

1708
02:02:55,471 --> 02:02:58,440
You guys are crazy,
I can't do that.

1709
02:02:58,441 --> 02:03:02,110
It's not about that,
it's about skating.

1710
02:03:13,187 --> 02:03:15,656
Whoo!

1711
02:03:15,657 --> 02:03:19,560
Come on. Come on.

1712
02:04:12,609 --> 02:04:14,042
Do you need help?

1713
02:04:23,719 --> 02:04:27,053
She's g... gone.

1714
02:04:27,054 --> 02:04:29,623
She's gone.

1715
02:04:29,624 --> 02:04:33,927
Who? Who's gone?

1716
02:04:33,928 --> 02:04:37,531
Mommy. Mommy's gone.

1717
02:04:41,200 --> 02:04:43,468
I...

1718
02:04:43,469 --> 02:04:46,438
I'm sorry.

1719
02:04:46,439 --> 02:04:48,674
She loved me.

1720
02:04:52,044 --> 02:04:54,647
She's the only one.

1721
02:04:58,449 --> 02:05:00,251
Mommy died.

1722
02:05:02,754 --> 02:05:05,022
Mommy died.

1723
02:05:13,463 --> 02:05:15,566
Lucy?

1724
02:05:17,668 --> 02:05:22,436
Lucy! Lucy!

1725
02:05:22,437 --> 02:05:25,139
Lucy!

1726
02:05:25,140 --> 02:05:27,976
Lucy!

1727
02:05:27,977 --> 02:05:31,212
Lucy! Lucy!

1728
02:05:31,213 --> 02:05:35,683
Lucy! Lucy!

1729
02:05:39,520 --> 02:05:42,255
Lucy!

1730
02:05:42,256 --> 02:05:44,658
Lucy!

1731
02:05:53,366 --> 02:05:57,003
Get in the car seat!
Get in the car seat!

1732
02:06:21,291 --> 02:06:23,761
It's okay, mommy.

1733
02:06:27,431 --> 02:06:29,298
Lucy.

1734
02:06:37,540 --> 02:06:39,708
I'm sorry.

1735
02:06:39,709 --> 02:06:42,310
I'm so sorry.

1736
02:06:47,850 --> 02:06:51,318
Would you like to go home?

1737
02:06:51,319 --> 02:06:53,688
Yeah?

1738
02:07:11,404 --> 02:07:13,973
Brad.

1739
02:07:13,974 --> 02:07:16,941
Brad, can you hear me?

1740
02:07:16,942 --> 02:07:21,112
D... don't move.
The ambulance is on its way.

1741
02:07:21,113 --> 02:07:24,282
Jesus.

1742
02:07:24,283 --> 02:07:26,283
What happened to me?

1743
02:07:26,284 --> 02:07:29,186
These kids say you've been out
cold for the last five minutes.

1744
02:07:29,187 --> 02:07:32,489
- You almost had it.
- Dude, you were awesome.

1745
02:07:32,490 --> 02:07:36,426
- That shit was gnarly, son.
- Back up, back up! Give him some space.

1746
02:07:36,427 --> 02:07:39,830
You just hold still, all right?
Hold still.

1747
02:07:44,101 --> 02:07:45,401
Hey, bro!

1748
02:07:45,402 --> 02:07:48,671
Here, this fell
out of your pocket.

1749
02:07:50,740 --> 02:07:52,741
I don't need it anymore.

1750
02:07:52,742 --> 02:07:55,510
- Hey, Duane.
- Hm?

1751
02:07:55,511 --> 02:07:58,513
Could you call my wife?

1752
02:07:58,514 --> 02:08:00,247
You got it, buddy.

1753
02:08:00,248 --> 02:08:02,616
Here we go.

1754
02:08:23,536 --> 02:08:26,039
I'm so sorry, Ronnie.

1755
02:08:28,274 --> 02:08:30,877
I really am.

1756
02:08:35,848 --> 02:08:40,018
I never wanted anything
like this to happen.

1757
02:08:54,231 --> 02:08:56,699
Are... are you... Are you okay?

1758
02:09:06,977 --> 02:09:11,179
- Oh, no!
- Gonna be good now.

1759
02:09:11,180 --> 02:09:14,149
Oh my god!

1760
02:09:18,720 --> 02:09:21,121
Hold on, Ronnie.

1761
02:09:21,122 --> 02:09:24,091
You hold on.

1762
02:09:24,092 --> 02:09:26,960
I'm not gonna let
anything happen to you.

1763
02:09:26,961 --> 02:09:29,662
You hold on there, okay, buddy?

1764
02:09:32,665 --> 02:09:34,700
In his wildest dreams

1765
02:09:34,701 --> 02:09:38,404
Larry would never have imagined he'd
once again be in this position,

1766
02:09:38,405 --> 02:09:41,940
where precious minutes count.

1767
02:09:41,941 --> 02:09:44,675
Tonight he could save a life.

1768
02:09:44,676 --> 02:09:47,612
He knew Ronnie had done
some bad things in the past,

1769
02:09:47,613 --> 02:09:52,283
but so had Larry.

1770
02:09:52,284 --> 02:09:55,220
You couldn't change the past.

1771
02:09:57,488 --> 02:10:01,893
But the future could
be a different story.

1772
02:10:10,300 --> 02:10:13,103
And it had to start somewhere.
