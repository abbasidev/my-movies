1
00:00:35,265 --> 00:00:37,601
<i>Horsemen! Horsemen!</i>

2
00:00:37,670 --> 00:00:41,204
<i>Horsemen! Horsemen!
Horsemen!</i>

3
00:00:41,271 --> 00:00:46,110
<i>Horsemen! Horsemen!
Horsemen! Horsemen!</i>

4
00:00:47,545 --> 00:00:49,179
<i>Did you think we abandoned you?</i>

5
00:00:54,085 --> 00:00:56,186
<i>Or that we'd run out of magic?</i>

6
00:00:57,756 --> 00:00:59,189
<i>Well, think again,
ladies and gentlemen,</i>

7
00:00:59,256 --> 00:01:01,259
<i>because you are
about to be amazed.</i>

8
00:01:04,328 --> 00:01:06,364
<i>If you're here right now,
then you have</i>

9
00:01:06,430 --> 00:01:08,198
<i>followed the clues
and cracked the code.</i>

10
00:01:10,135 --> 00:01:11,969
<i>Congratulations, and welcome.</i>

11
00:01:15,174 --> 00:01:17,575
<i>It's been 10 years since
the horseman last appeared,</i>

12
00:01:18,543 --> 00:01:20,111
<i>but we are back!</i>

13
00:01:23,816 --> 00:01:27,152
Okay, so, come in close.
Mm, closer.

14
00:01:27,218 --> 00:01:28,920
Because the more
you think you see,

15
00:01:28,986 --> 00:01:31,222
the easier it will be
to dress up old tricks

16
00:01:31,289 --> 00:01:32,890
and fool you that they are new.

17
00:01:35,159 --> 00:01:37,061
So, my name is
J. Daniel Atlas,

18
00:01:37,128 --> 00:01:39,097
and allow me
to speak as I often do

19
00:01:39,164 --> 00:01:41,799
for my less charismatic
colleagues when I say...

20
00:01:41,866 --> 00:01:43,902
Whoo! It is very good
to be back!

21
00:01:48,506 --> 00:01:50,141
Yes. Yes.
We vanished for a while,

22
00:01:50,209 --> 00:01:51,408
but in the world of magic,

23
00:01:51,475 --> 00:01:54,012
everything that disappears,
reappears.

24
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:56,014
Well, at least
if the trick is done right.

25
00:02:00,218 --> 00:02:02,921
I'm Merritt McKinney.

26
00:02:02,987 --> 00:02:06,323
Unlike my, uh, very good
buddy here, Danny,

27
00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:10,328
most of you checked your egos
at the door tonight.

28
00:02:10,394 --> 00:02:13,531
You found this
little underground soiree

29
00:02:13,598 --> 00:02:16,366
because you wanted
to get fooled.

30
00:02:16,433 --> 00:02:18,137
Hey, everyone.
I'm Jack Wilder.

31
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:25,843
Wars, pandemics,
climate change, AI.

32
00:02:25,911 --> 00:02:28,881
Let's face it, we all need
magic more than ever.

33
00:02:30,281 --> 00:02:33,350
So I want you to pay
very close attention.

34
00:02:33,417 --> 00:02:35,485
You are not gonna want
to miss this next trick.

35
00:02:40,224 --> 00:02:42,661
Henley Reeves,
now Henley Reeves Stanley.

36
00:02:42,728 --> 00:02:45,730
Three kids, two dogs
and a master's degree.

37
00:02:45,798 --> 00:02:47,064
It's been a while.

38
00:02:47,132 --> 00:02:48,331
Did you miss us?

39
00:02:52,271 --> 00:02:53,805
Those guys were great
back in the day.

40
00:02:53,872 --> 00:02:55,706
I used to want to be a magician.

41
00:02:55,774 --> 00:02:58,210
And then I turned 12.

42
00:02:58,276 --> 00:03:00,746
Careful,
they might be listening.

43
00:03:00,812 --> 00:03:02,346
Ooh, I'm shaking
in my AllSaints.

44
00:03:02,413 --> 00:03:04,581
What are they gonna do?

45
00:03:04,649 --> 00:03:06,317
Is that real gold?

46
00:03:06,384 --> 00:03:08,419
- What?
- Is that real gold?

47
00:03:08,485 --> 00:03:10,722
Yeah, I'm rich.

48
00:03:10,788 --> 00:03:12,858
This is a magic show, dude.

49
00:03:12,925 --> 00:03:14,860
Every fool here is a pickpocket,

50
00:03:14,926 --> 00:03:16,161
or a pickpocket's fool.

51
00:03:19,097 --> 00:03:20,998
- Was that a haiku?
- What was that?

52
00:03:21,066 --> 00:03:22,567
Each of you
just received a playing card.

53
00:03:22,633 --> 00:03:25,502
If you wouldn't mind, uh,
pulling it out?

54
00:03:25,569 --> 00:03:27,405
Right. Now, we're gonna
shuffle the deck,

55
00:03:27,471 --> 00:03:29,942
so everybody find
a random person near them

56
00:03:30,008 --> 00:03:32,076
and switch cards with them.

57
00:03:32,144 --> 00:03:33,277
And then when you've done that,

58
00:03:33,343 --> 00:03:36,014
find somebody else
and switch with them.

59
00:03:36,081 --> 00:03:37,716
Okay, great. Uh, now...

60
00:03:37,783 --> 00:03:39,751
Uh, duh-duh-duh-duh-duh...
You there, down there.

61
00:03:39,817 --> 00:03:41,519
- Me?
- Yeah. What is your card?

62
00:03:41,586 --> 00:03:43,956
- Ace of diamonds.
- Ace of diamonds. Okay.

63
00:03:44,021 --> 00:03:45,790
Let's make things a little
more complicated here.

64
00:03:45,858 --> 00:03:48,894
Does anybody else here
have the ace of diamonds?

65
00:03:48,961 --> 00:03:50,762
Wait, it's me.
Ace of diamonds!

66
00:03:52,496 --> 00:03:53,865
Ooh!

67
00:03:53,932 --> 00:03:57,269
Looks like we have a Fifth Horseman
not named Lula.

68
00:03:57,336 --> 00:03:59,937
Come up on stage,
you're gonna be our helper.

69
00:04:03,207 --> 00:04:05,376
- Do it!
- Yeah, go!

70
00:04:10,615 --> 00:04:13,818
Now, uh, look into my eyes

71
00:04:13,885 --> 00:04:16,553
and... sleep.

72
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:19,324
Still got it.

73
00:04:19,389 --> 00:04:21,793
Now, this might look like
an ordinary kid to you,

74
00:04:21,860 --> 00:04:25,797
but tonight, he is going to do
extraordinary magic

75
00:04:25,863 --> 00:04:28,266
like a man possessed.

76
00:04:28,332 --> 00:04:29,567
Literally.

77
00:04:29,634 --> 00:04:31,569
- Henley.
- Yes, Merritt.

78
00:04:31,636 --> 00:04:35,072
Would you mind
stepping inside his body?

79
00:04:36,908 --> 00:04:40,511
Yep. And, Jack, uh, why don't you throw
yourself on in there, too?

80
00:04:40,577 --> 00:04:42,247
What I do best.

81
00:04:42,314 --> 00:04:45,615
And... Oh, God help you.

82
00:04:45,683 --> 00:04:48,619
Atlas, why don't you
slither on inside, as well?

83
00:04:51,588 --> 00:04:54,326
And I might as well
wedge myself in there, too.

84
00:04:54,393 --> 00:04:56,961
It takes a village
to make magic.

85
00:05:03,067 --> 00:05:04,702
- Oh!
- Whoa!

86
00:05:04,769 --> 00:05:06,470
J. Daniel Atlas in the house.

87
00:05:06,536 --> 00:05:08,471
So, who wants
to see a magic trick?

88
00:05:13,444 --> 00:05:14,612
Take it away, Merritt.

89
00:05:17,048 --> 00:05:19,718
Hello, you beautiful people.

90
00:05:19,785 --> 00:05:23,021
Now, everyone knows that
Merritt McKinney reads minds.

91
00:05:23,088 --> 00:05:27,225
Well, now, I'm him.
Or he's me. Who knows?

92
00:05:28,559 --> 00:05:32,396
Uh, I'm sensing
someone came here tonight

93
00:05:32,463 --> 00:05:36,233
not to enjoy magic,
but to tear it down.

94
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:40,637
Is there a Brett Finnegan
in the house?

95
00:05:40,706 --> 00:05:42,540
What up?

96
00:05:45,911 --> 00:05:48,045
Now, you and your friends here

97
00:05:48,112 --> 00:05:51,249
set up the
Camp Hobart Crypto Exchange.

98
00:05:51,316 --> 00:05:52,918
- Fact. Yep. Yeah.
- It's what we're about.

99
00:05:52,985 --> 00:05:54,518
Took the good people
of New York's

100
00:05:54,584 --> 00:05:57,555
employee pension
and welfare fund half its cash.

101
00:05:57,620 --> 00:05:59,358
Uh, you're rounding up,

102
00:05:59,423 --> 00:06:01,826
and also, the risks were
laid out very clearly.

103
00:06:01,892 --> 00:06:03,694
Everybody knew what
they were getting into, dude.

104
00:06:03,762 --> 00:06:05,997
Did you hide
the profits offshore?

105
00:06:06,064 --> 00:06:13,038
Account ending in 53297?

106
00:06:14,439 --> 00:06:16,207
You couldn't know that
without my, uh...

107
00:06:18,910 --> 00:06:20,245
Oh, is this real gold?

108
00:06:21,846 --> 00:06:24,581
Brett, you ought to be more
careful with your things, man.

109
00:06:24,648 --> 00:06:26,685
Merritt's a psychic,
but me, Jack,

110
00:06:26,752 --> 00:06:28,519
I'm into sleight of hand.

111
00:06:28,586 --> 00:06:31,622
Ask your friends. They've just done
their part to close the wealth gap.

112
00:06:31,689 --> 00:06:33,624
What? What the...

113
00:06:33,692 --> 00:06:36,560
Now, here's
a little redistribution.

114
00:06:36,627 --> 00:06:38,062
Hey! Hey, hey!

115
00:06:42,834 --> 00:06:44,002
Thank you. Thank you.

116
00:06:44,069 --> 00:06:45,302
Lawyer up, dude!
I'll kick your ass!

117
00:06:45,370 --> 00:06:46,904
Uh-oh!

118
00:06:46,971 --> 00:06:49,540
Someone forgot Henley can fly.

119
00:07:02,187 --> 00:07:04,622
We can take it from here,
but a round of applause

120
00:07:04,689 --> 00:07:06,490
for the best Horseman on stage.

121
00:07:06,557 --> 00:07:09,127
Whoo! Wow.

122
00:07:09,194 --> 00:07:10,593
Hey, hey,
hey. Hey, hey.

123
00:07:10,661 --> 00:07:13,497
Fantastic. So, everybody,
I want you to take your drink,

124
00:07:13,564 --> 00:07:16,468
and I want you to pour it
onto the face of your card.

125
00:07:16,535 --> 00:07:18,836
Can you do that?

126
00:07:18,903 --> 00:07:21,572
Those 12 unique words
on each of your cards

127
00:07:21,639 --> 00:07:24,608
- form the password
to your new crypto wallet. - Oh!

128
00:07:24,675 --> 00:07:28,180
Log on and you'll find Brett's
stolen millions more...

129
00:07:28,245 --> 00:07:29,612
fairly redistributed.

130
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:33,084
Oh, my God. Fifty...
50,000 bucks!

131
00:07:33,151 --> 00:07:34,519
50,000!

132
00:07:37,689 --> 00:07:39,356
You're freaking done, dude!

133
00:07:39,423 --> 00:07:42,194
Whoa, whoa!
Cool your head, gingerbread,

134
00:07:42,259 --> 00:07:44,028
because I am having a vision.

135
00:07:44,096 --> 00:07:48,100
Eh, maybe cops are gonna come
bursting through that door!

136
00:07:48,165 --> 00:07:49,834
So perform a magic trick
of your own

137
00:07:49,901 --> 00:07:53,704
and disappear
in three, two, one.

138
00:08:08,252 --> 00:08:12,156
<i>Now come in close. Mm, closer.</i>

139
00:08:12,223 --> 00:08:14,860
<i>Because the more you think you see,
the easier it will be</i>

140
00:08:14,925 --> 00:08:16,161
<i>- to dress up old tricks...</i>
- What?

141
00:08:16,228 --> 00:08:17,728
<i>...and fool you
that they are new.</i>

142
00:08:19,629 --> 00:08:20,899
Oh, my God, no.

143
00:08:21,432 --> 00:08:22,667
No!

144
00:08:22,733 --> 00:08:24,569
No!

145
00:08:40,251 --> 00:08:43,321
Look, in my opinion,
I think you did a great job.

146
00:08:43,388 --> 00:08:45,157
Uh, I think my Atlas was good.

147
00:08:45,222 --> 00:08:46,490
My Merritt could
probably use some work.

148
00:08:46,557 --> 00:08:48,692
- Mm.
- It's like a San Diego stoner

149
00:08:48,759 --> 00:08:50,394
and a shrimp boat captain
had a baby.

150
00:08:50,461 --> 00:08:51,897
Sure.

151
00:08:51,962 --> 00:08:53,899
No, seriously, Bosco,
I don't know how you do it.

152
00:08:53,965 --> 00:08:56,100
A good impersonation
isn't just about the mimicry.

153
00:08:56,168 --> 00:08:58,135
It's about attention to detail,

154
00:08:58,202 --> 00:08:59,703
personality and nuance.

155
00:08:59,770 --> 00:09:01,373
Okay. Okay.
Let me try, let me try.

156
00:09:01,438 --> 00:09:03,908
Um...
I'm J. Daniel Atlas.

157
00:09:03,975 --> 00:09:06,912
The closer
you look, the less you see.

158
00:09:06,977 --> 00:09:08,013
It was something.

159
00:09:08,078 --> 00:09:09,514
Yep. Uh, you'll work on it.

160
00:09:09,581 --> 00:09:10,682
- I wasn't bad.
- It was a good start.

161
00:09:10,749 --> 00:09:12,551
- But it could use some work.
- Okay, sure.

162
00:09:12,616 --> 00:09:14,351
- What do you keep looking at?
- Nothing, nothing, nothing.

163
00:09:14,418 --> 00:09:17,288
Dude, cheer up.
Guys, come on! Look at us!

164
00:09:17,355 --> 00:09:20,759
Look at how far we've come.
We totally scored tonight.

165
00:09:20,825 --> 00:09:22,693
All right, next time,
you wear the pink wig, okay?

166
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:24,428
No.

167
00:09:24,495 --> 00:09:27,032
- Dude, it's locked again.
- Okay, I'll pick it.

168
00:09:27,097 --> 00:09:28,700
Wait, wait, wait, hold on.
Do the thing.

169
00:09:28,767 --> 00:09:29,868
- No.
- Please do the thing.

170
00:09:29,934 --> 00:09:31,101
- It's so unnecessary.
- It's so cool.

171
00:09:31,168 --> 00:09:32,470
- I'll hold your bag.
- It's so unnecessary.

172
00:09:32,537 --> 00:09:34,072
- Come on, it's fun.
- Okay.

173
00:09:41,479 --> 00:09:42,746
You got this.

174
00:09:46,717 --> 00:09:49,221
- She's like a little Mario.
- She is like Mario.

175
00:09:49,287 --> 00:09:51,088
- Careful, careful.
- Please don't die.

176
00:09:51,155 --> 00:09:52,692
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

177
00:09:55,661 --> 00:09:57,562
If I could do that,
I would only do that.

178
00:09:57,629 --> 00:09:59,597
- It's so cool.
- It's insane.

179
00:09:59,664 --> 00:10:00,666
Happy?

180
00:10:00,731 --> 00:10:01,966
- Yeah, that was awesome.
- Yeah.

181
00:10:02,033 --> 00:10:04,134
Please let us in.
It's cold.

182
00:10:04,201 --> 00:10:05,971
Whoo.

183
00:10:06,037 --> 00:10:07,839
Best apartment
in the whole city.

184
00:10:07,905 --> 00:10:10,274
Yep, and no one
will ever see it but us.

185
00:10:13,611 --> 00:10:14,946
<i>♪ Everybody... ♪</i>

186
00:10:15,013 --> 00:10:16,213
It's such a shame.

187
00:10:17,649 --> 00:10:20,619
<i>♪ But in my armor
I am a man... ♪</i>

188
00:10:20,686 --> 00:10:21,885
<i>Come in close.</i>

189
00:10:22,519 --> 00:10:23,520
<i>Closer.</i>

190
00:10:23,587 --> 00:10:26,991
That guy is so screwed.

191
00:10:28,661 --> 00:10:30,261
Who's rich now?

192
00:10:30,327 --> 00:10:32,297
Charlie, can you turn
that thing off, please?

193
00:10:32,364 --> 00:10:33,764
I think I've had
enough Atlas for one night.

194
00:10:33,831 --> 00:10:34,832
Yeah, I got you.

195
00:10:34,899 --> 00:10:36,533
<i>...disappears, reappears.</i>

196
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:39,037
<i>At least
if the trick is done right.</i>

197
00:10:39,104 --> 00:10:41,306
Bosco, can you check
for pizza? I'm so hungry.

198
00:10:41,373 --> 00:10:42,506
Ugh, me, too.

199
00:10:42,573 --> 00:10:43,475
<i>...Four Horsemen!</i>

200
00:10:43,540 --> 00:10:45,876
No pizza, but we got beer.

201
00:10:45,943 --> 00:10:47,812
- And, no, literally just beer.
<i>- Closer. Because</i>

202
00:10:47,879 --> 00:10:49,313
<i>- the more you think you see...</i>
- Any takers?

203
00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:51,316
Yeah, I'll have one.

204
00:10:51,383 --> 00:10:52,717
Dude, seriously,
turn that thing off.

205
00:10:52,783 --> 00:10:54,451
I did.

206
00:10:54,519 --> 00:10:57,455
Okay. Real funny, guys.
Where's the other projector?

207
00:10:57,522 --> 00:10:58,523
I'm not a hologram.

208
00:10:58,590 --> 00:11:00,524
"I'm not a hologram."
Right. Yes.

209
00:11:00,591 --> 00:11:02,427
Exactly what
a hologram would say.

210
00:11:03,894 --> 00:11:05,797
- Oh, my God, you're real.
- Never touch my face again.

211
00:11:05,864 --> 00:11:07,298
I'm so sorry. I thought
that you were a hologram.

212
00:11:07,365 --> 00:11:09,134
I would never do that.
I'm a huge fan of yours.

213
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:10,402
How are you?

214
00:11:10,467 --> 00:11:12,803
How did you find us?

215
00:11:12,870 --> 00:11:14,572
I don't know.
Took me about 30 seconds.

216
00:11:14,639 --> 00:11:16,073
And if it was this easy
for me to find you,

217
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:17,841
how hard would it be
for the police?

218
00:11:17,908 --> 00:11:20,144
- Whoa, hold on, the police?
- Yeah, the police.

219
00:11:20,211 --> 00:11:22,080
Why would the police
be looking for us?

220
00:11:22,147 --> 00:11:23,181
Uh, I don't know,
what about that

221
00:11:23,248 --> 00:11:24,548
little heist you just pulled?

222
00:11:24,615 --> 00:11:27,018
Or the fact that you're
squatting in this place

223
00:11:27,085 --> 00:11:28,153
or that your electricity
comes from

224
00:11:28,219 --> 00:11:29,654
the circuit box in the corner?

225
00:11:29,721 --> 00:11:31,822
I don't know, it could be anything.
Am I right, Bozo?

226
00:11:31,889 --> 00:11:33,325
Bosco.

227
00:11:33,390 --> 00:11:34,693
- Hmm.
- Bosco Leroy.

228
00:11:34,759 --> 00:11:37,095
Ah, that's right, yeah,
Bosco Leroy.

229
00:11:37,162 --> 00:11:40,331
What, did you type, uh,
"fictional magician name" into ChatGPT?

230
00:11:40,398 --> 00:11:42,900
- No, that's actually my real name, Atlas.
- Hmm.

231
00:11:42,966 --> 00:11:44,436
What, did your mom
have sex with a map?

232
00:11:46,604 --> 00:11:48,707
- That's not funny.
- Hmm.

233
00:11:48,774 --> 00:11:50,008
You don't know
anything about us, dude.

234
00:11:50,075 --> 00:11:51,677
- I know everything about you.
- Oh.

235
00:11:51,744 --> 00:11:54,346
The dubiously named Bosco Leroy,

236
00:11:54,412 --> 00:11:55,846
a promising acting career

237
00:11:55,913 --> 00:11:57,881
cut short
by crippling student loans.

238
00:11:57,948 --> 00:11:59,451
It's a bummer you had to
drop out of Juilliard,

239
00:11:59,517 --> 00:12:02,187
but you never
stopped performing.

240
00:12:02,253 --> 00:12:04,221
Uh, if memory serves,
your last paid gig,

241
00:12:04,288 --> 00:12:06,291
I think, was dressing as Elmo
in Times Square?

242
00:12:06,357 --> 00:12:08,125
Okay, first of all,
I was never Elmo.

243
00:12:08,192 --> 00:12:09,259
It's the red Teletubby.

244
00:12:09,326 --> 00:12:11,129
Po!

245
00:12:11,196 --> 00:12:12,731
- What?
- The red Teletubby.

246
00:12:12,798 --> 00:12:13,965
- Her name is Po.
- Oh, Po!

247
00:12:14,032 --> 00:12:15,100
She's my favorite one.

248
00:12:15,166 --> 00:12:16,201
Right?

249
00:12:16,267 --> 00:12:18,403
- Her name is Po.
- Cute.

250
00:12:19,471 --> 00:12:21,538
And you, June Rouclere.

251
00:12:21,605 --> 00:12:22,974
Kicked out
of every boarding school

252
00:12:23,041 --> 00:12:24,710
your parents
forced you to attend.

253
00:12:24,777 --> 00:12:26,411
Not a big fan
of authority, I take it.

254
00:12:26,477 --> 00:12:27,779
Uh, let me guess.

255
00:12:27,846 --> 00:12:29,880
Uh, you think the "olds"
broke the planet

256
00:12:29,947 --> 00:12:31,950
and it's your generation's
duty to clean up their mess.

257
00:12:32,015 --> 00:12:33,818
- Am I right?
- Am I wrong?

258
00:12:34,854 --> 00:12:35,919
No.

259
00:12:35,986 --> 00:12:37,389
And so, you ran away from home,

260
00:12:37,455 --> 00:12:39,759
made your way to New York,
where you ran into this guy

261
00:12:39,825 --> 00:12:41,993
at Tannin's Magic Shop,
Charlie Gayes.

262
00:12:42,059 --> 00:12:44,129
- Yeah, hi.
- Yeah, hi.

263
00:12:44,195 --> 00:12:45,663
I actually couldn't find
a lot about you online.

264
00:12:45,730 --> 00:12:47,298
Although, I do know
you were an orphan

265
00:12:47,365 --> 00:12:49,334
and you were in and out of foster care
your entire childhood,

266
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:50,668
and that you didn't know
the meaning of family

267
00:12:50,735 --> 00:12:52,336
until you hooked up
with these two.

268
00:12:52,403 --> 00:12:54,572
And so, the three of you
have been working

269
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:56,307
your little Robin Hood act
for years now,

270
00:12:56,374 --> 00:12:58,275
trying to change the world
one trick at a time,

271
00:12:58,342 --> 00:13:01,613
all leading to your riskiest
theft to date, my identity.

272
00:13:01,679 --> 00:13:02,681
You were there?

273
00:13:02,748 --> 00:13:04,081
You had our faces plastered

274
00:13:04,149 --> 00:13:05,817
on every scaffolding
and subway stop in the city.

275
00:13:05,884 --> 00:13:07,184
That's copyright infringement,
by the way.

276
00:13:07,251 --> 00:13:08,285
Of course, I was there.

277
00:13:08,352 --> 00:13:10,221
So, what'd you think?

278
00:13:11,657 --> 00:13:13,158
- I think your Merritt needs work.
- I knew it.

279
00:13:13,224 --> 00:13:14,259
- That's a sensitive topic.
- No.

280
00:13:14,325 --> 00:13:15,460
- You don't even get it.
- He's lying.

281
00:13:15,527 --> 00:13:16,828
But overall design
was impressive.

282
00:13:16,895 --> 00:13:18,831
That's you, I assume,
the quiet guy?

283
00:13:18,898 --> 00:13:20,532
- Textbook, behind the scenes.
- Yeah, well,

284
00:13:20,597 --> 00:13:22,500
- Alexander Herrmann...
- Oh, boy.

285
00:13:22,567 --> 00:13:25,202
...he said that the people who designed
his tricks were the real geniuses.

286
00:13:25,269 --> 00:13:27,538
The fact that you know
that man's name,

287
00:13:27,605 --> 00:13:29,474
"behind the scenes" clearly.

288
00:13:29,541 --> 00:13:31,777
And you, your sleight of hand
was advanced. Good dexterity.

289
00:13:31,844 --> 00:13:33,846
You're quick and nimble on your feet.
Really, I was impressed.

290
00:13:33,913 --> 00:13:35,613
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

291
00:13:35,681 --> 00:13:37,048
Sounds like we're pretty great.

292
00:13:37,115 --> 00:13:38,515
You're far from it.

293
00:13:38,582 --> 00:13:42,486
But, uh, maybe with a little
fine tuning, you could be.

294
00:13:42,553 --> 00:13:44,989
Yeah, I could... I could see
why The Eye sent me to you.

295
00:13:45,056 --> 00:13:46,524
- I'm sorry.
- Wait, did you say "The Eye"?

296
00:13:46,591 --> 00:13:47,625
Yeah, The Eye.

297
00:13:49,293 --> 00:13:50,995
All right, listen.

298
00:13:51,062 --> 00:13:54,331
This card arrived at my apartment
three weeks ago,

299
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:55,668
along with four plane tickets

300
00:13:55,734 --> 00:13:57,201
and instructions
hidden in the lining

301
00:13:57,268 --> 00:13:58,671
for a trick bigger and better

302
00:13:58,736 --> 00:14:01,139
than anything
you have ever seen.

303
00:14:01,206 --> 00:14:04,509
A trick that, for some reason,
includes the three of you.

304
00:14:04,576 --> 00:14:05,845
- Us?
- Mm-hmm.

305
00:14:05,910 --> 00:14:07,544
- Why not the other Horsemen?
- No,

306
00:14:07,611 --> 00:14:08,847
- the other horsemen are dead.
- What?

307
00:14:08,913 --> 00:14:10,716
To me, they're dead to me.
Stop interrupting.

308
00:14:10,783 --> 00:14:13,317
No, things got emotional.
Everyone quit.

309
00:14:13,384 --> 00:14:15,352
I took a walkabout in Australia.
It's a long story.

310
00:14:15,419 --> 00:14:18,056
And now you need us?

311
00:14:18,121 --> 00:14:19,456
According to that card, yes.

312
00:14:20,591 --> 00:14:21,993
Well, we don't need you, so...

313
00:14:22,059 --> 00:14:23,427
Bosco.

314
00:14:23,495 --> 00:14:25,163
What? What do we need this
guy for? We're crushing it.

315
00:14:25,230 --> 00:14:26,563
You're crushing it?
You're stealing

316
00:14:26,630 --> 00:14:27,899
a little money
from some crypto bro.

317
00:14:27,966 --> 00:14:30,100
I'm talking about
big fish here, man.

318
00:14:30,168 --> 00:14:31,436
I'm talking
about something that will

319
00:14:31,503 --> 00:14:33,004
make a real difference.

320
00:14:33,071 --> 00:14:34,205
I thought that's what
you kids are all about.

321
00:14:34,272 --> 00:14:35,273
It is. No, exactly.

322
00:14:35,340 --> 00:14:36,508
Yes, we are.

323
00:14:36,573 --> 00:14:39,076
Yeah, but I think we can
catch our own fish.

324
00:14:39,143 --> 00:14:40,611
- You can?
- No, no, he...

325
00:14:40,678 --> 00:14:41,713
- Good luck with that.
- What? No.

326
00:14:41,779 --> 00:14:43,581
Can you just wait one second?

327
00:14:43,648 --> 00:14:45,850
What are you doing? What's... what's going on?
Are you out of your mind?

328
00:14:45,918 --> 00:14:48,921
- This is J. Daniel Atlas.
- Yeah, I know who he is.

329
00:14:48,988 --> 00:14:50,288
He's a freaking legend.

330
00:14:50,355 --> 00:14:52,289
He was a legend.
Now he's just kind of a dick.

331
00:14:52,356 --> 00:14:53,692
- Can you...
- Yeah, sure.

332
00:14:53,759 --> 00:14:56,594
Bosco, he's kind of a dick,
but he is a Horseman.

333
00:14:56,662 --> 00:14:59,899
I mean, come on,
just trust us on this, please.

334
00:14:59,965 --> 00:15:01,866
Okay. Decision time, kids.
What's it gonna be?

335
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:03,969
Are you in...

336
00:15:04,034 --> 00:15:05,636
...or are you out?

337
00:15:13,278 --> 00:15:14,278
What's the trick?

338
00:15:23,354 --> 00:15:25,957
Welcome,
esteemed community members,

339
00:15:26,024 --> 00:15:29,394
valued press,
friends and colleagues.

340
00:15:29,460 --> 00:15:32,163
We are gathered here
tonight to celebrate

341
00:15:32,230 --> 00:15:34,799
Vanderberg's latest
and greatest mine,

342
00:15:34,866 --> 00:15:37,601
C3, or as we like to call her,

343
00:15:37,669 --> 00:15:41,272
"Amahle," Zulu
for "The Beautiful One."

344
00:15:41,338 --> 00:15:43,240
Because every child is beautiful

345
00:15:43,307 --> 00:15:44,743
in the eyes of its mother.

346
00:15:46,177 --> 00:15:48,013
Our customer can rest assured

347
00:15:48,078 --> 00:15:51,783
that when they buy the world's
greatest symbol of love

348
00:15:51,850 --> 00:15:54,687
that it was produced
with nothing but.

349
00:15:54,753 --> 00:15:58,355
To Amahle, and to all of you.

350
00:16:00,325 --> 00:16:03,761
Well, thank you all so much
for making the trip out here.

351
00:16:03,828 --> 00:16:07,331
Now, I take it you were
all impressed by Amahle.

352
00:16:07,398 --> 00:16:09,033
Sorry, C3.

353
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:11,535
- Oh, it's quite dramatic.
- Yeah, it's amazing.

354
00:16:11,602 --> 00:16:16,274
But I also understand that you have
chosen this fine day to broach some concerns,

355
00:16:16,341 --> 00:16:19,277
which, contrary to your expectations,
I don't begrudge.

356
00:16:20,044 --> 00:16:21,713
Fire away.

357
00:16:21,779 --> 00:16:24,716
Right. Well, um,
the board feels that

358
00:16:24,783 --> 00:16:27,485
projections
might be optimistic...

359
00:16:27,552 --> 00:16:28,721
Mm.

360
00:16:28,787 --> 00:16:30,455
...with increasing competition
from lab grown

361
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:31,823
and, in the event
borrowing rates plum...

362
00:16:31,889 --> 00:16:33,826
William. William.

363
00:16:33,892 --> 00:16:35,894
My father loved you,
but there was

364
00:16:35,961 --> 00:16:38,229
a reason he called you
his dark cloud.

365
00:16:38,764 --> 00:16:40,365
Aw, shame.

366
00:16:40,431 --> 00:16:43,034
The Vanderberg family
does not lose.

367
00:16:43,101 --> 00:16:45,703
As you're well aware,
our motorsports team just won

368
00:16:45,770 --> 00:16:48,841
the Monaco Championship
for the seventh time.

369
00:16:50,207 --> 00:16:51,844
The mine will produce.

370
00:16:52,576 --> 00:16:53,577
Next?

371
00:16:55,047 --> 00:16:56,213
Right.

372
00:16:56,279 --> 00:16:57,514
Pricing. The minimums
that you've set for...

373
00:16:57,581 --> 00:16:58,817
Will you humor me, William?

374
00:16:58,884 --> 00:17:01,754
In a demonstration
about reality?

375
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:06,490
This diamond is say, what,
55 carats?

376
00:17:06,557 --> 00:17:10,627
The AWDC would price it
at 3,000,000 US dollars.

377
00:17:12,931 --> 00:17:14,231
William, will you
open your mouth

378
00:17:14,298 --> 00:17:15,701
and stick out your tongue?

379
00:17:18,971 --> 00:17:20,071
Now.

380
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:24,843
- Really?
- Really.

381
00:17:35,318 --> 00:17:36,788
Now, if William here
were to swallow it,

382
00:17:36,855 --> 00:17:40,458
that selfsame diamond would
tear his throat to shreds.

383
00:17:40,525 --> 00:17:43,461
He would bleed to death
before paramedics arrived.

384
00:17:44,362 --> 00:17:46,798
So, to the AWDC, it's 3,000,000,

385
00:17:46,865 --> 00:17:49,299
but to William, priceless.

386
00:17:50,802 --> 00:17:53,237
Tell me then,
as the CEO responsible

387
00:17:53,304 --> 00:17:55,708
for the world's
last great diamond mines,

388
00:17:55,773 --> 00:17:57,607
should I undercut our profits,

389
00:17:57,675 --> 00:17:59,376
or should I choose prices

390
00:17:59,443 --> 00:18:01,913
that I know
are unique clients will pay?

391
00:18:07,351 --> 00:18:08,385
As I thought.

392
00:18:09,887 --> 00:18:12,790
Now...

393
00:18:12,857 --> 00:18:16,161
...unless there are
more concerns,

394
00:18:16,227 --> 00:18:19,363
I would like to head
to Antwerp with my price list

395
00:18:20,164 --> 00:18:22,701
and show off our stones.

396
00:18:27,637 --> 00:18:31,308
Oh, uh, you know, you probably could have led
with a free trip to Europe?

397
00:18:31,375 --> 00:18:33,577
You know, a little known fact
about Antwerp, is that...

398
00:18:33,644 --> 00:18:35,146
Oh, great, more magic trivia.
This is fun.

399
00:18:35,213 --> 00:18:36,247
No, I was just gonna say that

400
00:18:36,314 --> 00:18:37,615
they make great biscuits.

401
00:18:37,682 --> 00:18:39,117
Oh, do they? Can we
actually get some, please?

402
00:18:39,183 --> 00:18:40,585
- On Atlas, obviously.
- No.

403
00:18:40,652 --> 00:18:42,186
No, no, I'm not
getting you biscuits.

404
00:18:42,252 --> 00:18:44,288
I just got you chocolates, okay?

405
00:18:44,355 --> 00:18:46,090
All right, listen,
this is not a vacation, okay?

406
00:18:46,157 --> 00:18:48,126
We have three days
to prepare an effect

407
00:18:48,192 --> 00:18:51,697
that'll make your barely passable Pepper's Ghost trick
look like a cave painting.

408
00:18:52,865 --> 00:18:53,965
All right, come here.

409
00:18:57,169 --> 00:18:59,805
The Heart Diamond, the most
valuable jewel in history

410
00:18:59,872 --> 00:19:02,507
and the foundation of the
Vanderberg Mining Corporation.

411
00:19:04,442 --> 00:19:06,944
<i>Now, for years, the family's
kept this big rock</i>

412
00:19:07,011 --> 00:19:08,780
<i>hidden inside
their secret vault,</i>

413
00:19:09,614 --> 00:19:12,282
<i>70 stories underground.</i>

414
00:19:12,349 --> 00:19:15,220
<i>And not just any ground.
The Arabian Desert.</i>

415
00:19:26,765 --> 00:19:29,567
<i>No one beyond their most
trusted team has been inside.</i>

416
00:19:31,536 --> 00:19:33,204
<i>Access through
a single elevator,</i>

417
00:19:33,271 --> 00:19:36,040
<i>constantly monitored
by armed guards...</i>

418
00:19:37,209 --> 00:19:38,844
Identity verified.

419
00:19:38,911 --> 00:19:41,645
<i>...and behind a multi-level biometric
security system.</i>

420
00:19:50,788 --> 00:19:52,057
<i>But the world will be watching,</i>

421
00:19:52,124 --> 00:19:55,259
<i>because for the first time
in half a century,</i>

422
00:19:55,326 --> 00:19:57,595
<i>that diamond is
being traveled here</i>

423
00:19:59,230 --> 00:20:01,232
to Antwerp,
to establish credibility

424
00:20:01,299 --> 00:20:03,000
and to spur bidding
at a private auction

425
00:20:03,067 --> 00:20:05,603
for the company's latest finds
in three days' time.

426
00:20:05,671 --> 00:20:06,872
Okay, obviously,
I'm down for stealing.

427
00:20:06,939 --> 00:20:08,605
But what makes
this diamond so special?

428
00:20:08,673 --> 00:20:11,375
Well, because the magical tarot card
told us to, June, right?

429
00:20:11,442 --> 00:20:13,443
Yeah, okay, that's very cute.
But can I please finish?

430
00:20:13,510 --> 00:20:15,279
You're not finished? Jeez,
you've been talking forever.

431
00:20:15,346 --> 00:20:16,446
Yes, and I'm about to talk more.

432
00:20:16,513 --> 00:20:18,083
So, please, pay attention.

433
00:20:18,150 --> 00:20:20,184
For decades, first,
Peter Vanderberg,

434
00:20:20,251 --> 00:20:21,586
now his daughter, Veronika,

435
00:20:21,653 --> 00:20:23,721
have been selling these
diamonds at inflated prices

436
00:20:23,788 --> 00:20:26,692
to arms dealers, traffickers,
warlords the world over,

437
00:20:26,758 --> 00:20:28,625
to, like,
help launder their money.

438
00:20:28,693 --> 00:20:30,194
So, I mean, the cash is dirty.

439
00:20:30,261 --> 00:20:32,395
I mean, in some cases, it's,
like, literally blood-soaked.

440
00:20:32,462 --> 00:20:33,865
But then, <i>voila...</i>

441
00:20:33,932 --> 00:20:35,733
...it's cleaned in exchange
for these precious stones.

442
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:38,769
She makes all the world's
worst people possible.

443
00:20:38,836 --> 00:20:41,205
So, whoever
sent that tarot card...

444
00:20:41,272 --> 00:20:43,909
Are the few truly honorable
people left in this world.

445
00:20:43,976 --> 00:20:45,810
The only people that
still care about justice.

446
00:20:45,877 --> 00:20:47,278
They're people I haven't
spoken to in a long time.

447
00:20:47,346 --> 00:20:49,280
They call themselves "The Eye,"

448
00:20:49,347 --> 00:20:50,548
and they want us to do something

449
00:20:50,615 --> 00:20:51,817
that the Horsemen never could.

450
00:20:52,351 --> 00:20:53,986
This, man,

451
00:20:54,051 --> 00:20:55,419
this is a chance
to drive a stake

452
00:20:55,486 --> 00:20:57,088
through the heart
of the devil herself.

453
00:20:57,154 --> 00:20:58,388
Let's do it.

454
00:21:01,125 --> 00:21:04,494
All eyes will be on me
and the Heart tonight at the auction.

455
00:21:04,561 --> 00:21:06,265
I have to look dazzling.

456
00:21:06,330 --> 00:21:08,066
Do you have
that Kitten Kiss color?

457
00:21:11,568 --> 00:21:12,671
Lethabo.

458
00:21:13,570 --> 00:21:15,106
- Yes?
- Straw.

459
00:21:15,173 --> 00:21:18,509
Who's that British photographer
from <i>Vanity Fair?</i>

460
00:21:18,576 --> 00:21:20,577
Uh, what's his name again?
Marc...

461
00:21:21,212 --> 00:21:22,314
Marc Scriber?

462
00:21:22,381 --> 00:21:24,082
- Schreiber, good God.
- Schreiber.

463
00:21:24,148 --> 00:21:26,084
Confirm him, cancel the others.

464
00:21:26,151 --> 00:21:29,253
We went wide last year.
This year, exclusivity.

465
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:31,256
- All right.
- We're open, transparent.

466
00:21:31,323 --> 00:21:32,691
We have nothing to hide.

467
00:21:32,758 --> 00:21:35,027
Okay, perfect.
I'll have it done.

468
00:21:36,060 --> 00:21:37,494
This is Veronika.

469
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:39,397
<i>♪ Hush little baby ♪</i>

470
00:21:39,462 --> 00:21:40,898
<i>♪ Don't say a word ♪</i>

471
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:42,733
Who is this?

472
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:44,836
<i>♪ Papa's gonna

473
00:21:44,903 --> 00:21:46,171

474
00:21:46,238 --> 00:21:47,505
Vacate.

475
00:21:47,570 --> 00:21:48,538
<i>♪ Don't sing ♪</i>

476
00:21:48,605 --> 00:21:49,942
How did you get this number?

477
00:21:50,008 --> 00:21:53,045
<i>♪ Papa's gonna buy you
a diamond ring ♪</i>

478
00:21:53,111 --> 00:21:56,714
This is a private line,
and that was a bit tone deaf.

479
00:21:58,282 --> 00:21:59,549
I asked who you are.

480
00:21:59,616 --> 00:22:02,119
<i>Ah, Veronika.</i>

481
00:22:02,186 --> 00:22:04,155
<i>The storage unit to your left.</i>

482
00:22:15,099 --> 00:22:16,300
<i>Look familiar?</i>

483
00:22:17,702 --> 00:22:21,173
<i>It belonged to that boy
who died 15 years ago.</i>

484
00:22:22,740 --> 00:22:24,742
This means nothing
to me or anyone.

485
00:22:24,809 --> 00:22:25,911
<i>Really?</i>

486
00:22:25,978 --> 00:22:28,079
<i>You and I both know
what you did.</i>

487
00:22:30,082 --> 00:22:32,017
Look, if you have real evidence

488
00:22:32,084 --> 00:22:34,752
and you're out to get me,
why not just use it?

489
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:40,358
<i>Fifteen years ago, you took
what your father loved most.</i>

490
00:22:40,424 --> 00:22:43,560
<i>Now I'm going to do
the same to you.</i>

491
00:22:43,626 --> 00:22:46,263
<i>I want the Heart Diamond.</i>

492
00:22:47,332 --> 00:22:48,799
<i>You're going to give it to me.</i>

493
00:22:50,134 --> 00:22:52,104
<i>Or I'm going to
hold up a looking glass</i>

494
00:22:52,170 --> 00:22:54,472
<i>for the whole world
to see you as you are.</i>

495
00:22:55,673 --> 00:22:58,442
Go ahead.
I have nothing to hide.

496
00:23:16,127 --> 00:23:17,128
- Oh, my God.
- Hey.

497
00:23:17,194 --> 00:23:18,296
I'm so sorry about that.

498
00:23:19,798 --> 00:23:20,898
Hi. Can you
help me find this?

499
00:23:20,965 --> 00:23:22,200
I've been looking
literally for an hour.

500
00:23:22,267 --> 00:23:24,135
Yes. It's gonna be
right over there, ma'am.

501
00:23:38,215 --> 00:23:40,818
Marc Schreiber, James Winn,
Vanderberg PR.

502
00:23:43,654 --> 00:23:44,990
Huge admirer of your work.

503
00:23:45,057 --> 00:23:46,758
James?
What happened to Dani?

504
00:23:46,825 --> 00:23:49,294
Oh, Dani. Yeah, sadly,
we had to let her go.

505
00:23:49,361 --> 00:23:51,128
Turns out she was racist.

506
00:23:51,195 --> 00:23:54,965
And also, she booked you
into the Radisson Blu

507
00:23:55,032 --> 00:23:58,236
- in a partial view, double.
- Ugh.

508
00:23:58,302 --> 00:24:01,105
Thankfully, I took the liberty
of moving you to the FRANQ.

509
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:04,409
I do love the FRANQ.

510
00:24:04,476 --> 00:24:08,346
Yes, the presidential suite
is befitting of, well,

511
00:24:08,413 --> 00:24:11,249
presidents and talented
photographers like yourself.

512
00:24:11,316 --> 00:24:13,484
Uh, your gala invitation
has been rerouted.

513
00:24:13,551 --> 00:24:15,220
If I could just check
your confirmation?

514
00:24:18,557 --> 00:24:19,758
Thank you.

515
00:24:19,825 --> 00:24:21,093
I also bumped your shoot
from 7:00 to 9:00 p.m.

516
00:24:21,159 --> 00:24:23,728
to give you proper time
to make your magic.

517
00:24:25,163 --> 00:24:27,065
- Someone gets it.
- Yeah.

518
00:24:33,038 --> 00:24:34,506
<i>♪ I'm shinin'
like a supernova ♪</i>

519
00:24:34,573 --> 00:24:37,875
<i>♪ With my hands up high
And my heart wide open... ♪</i>

520
00:24:40,177 --> 00:24:44,082
<i>♪ I shine even more bright
Like a diamond ♪</i>

521
00:24:44,148 --> 00:24:47,285
<i>♪ Brush that fear
right off my shoulder... ♪</i>

522
00:24:47,352 --> 00:24:50,454
Take, for instance, diamonds
created in laboratories.

523
00:24:50,521 --> 00:24:52,124
They purport to have value,

524
00:24:52,190 --> 00:24:54,358
but they're neither
natural nor rare.

525
00:24:54,425 --> 00:24:57,295
What honest woman wants
a falsehood on her finger?

526
00:24:57,362 --> 00:24:58,497
I agree.

527
00:24:58,563 --> 00:25:00,164
One of the great truths left

528
00:25:00,231 --> 00:25:02,500
is the power
behind a natural gem.

529
00:25:02,567 --> 00:25:05,002
Real diamonds
fill people with passion,

530
00:25:05,069 --> 00:25:06,570
as they have for centuries.

531
00:25:06,636 --> 00:25:08,173
That's right.
In fact, Marie-Antoinette,

532
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:10,075
wore the Hope Diamond
for a single day,

533
00:25:10,142 --> 00:25:11,242
and a month later...

534
00:25:11,308 --> 00:25:12,643
...was dragged
to the guillotine

535
00:25:12,711 --> 00:25:14,644
by some very, well,
as you say, passionate folks.

536
00:25:16,114 --> 00:25:17,982
But Marie-Antoinette didn't
die because of a diamond.

537
00:25:18,048 --> 00:25:20,352
She died because of
a monstrous lack of empathy.

538
00:25:20,417 --> 00:25:21,586
Well...

539
00:25:21,653 --> 00:25:23,888
And truth is,
she never even wore the Hope.

540
00:25:23,954 --> 00:25:25,323
People just believe she did.

541
00:25:25,390 --> 00:25:26,758
Really?
That's kind of interesting.

542
00:25:26,825 --> 00:25:28,359
So it was not the mob
that killed her,

543
00:25:28,425 --> 00:25:29,594
and it was not the guillotine,

544
00:25:29,661 --> 00:25:31,328
it was a... a story.

545
00:25:32,564 --> 00:25:34,332
I must not know
my own guest list.

546
00:25:34,398 --> 00:25:35,933
Are you in the diamond business?

547
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,403
No, no, I'm in the
illusion business, like you.

548
00:25:39,770 --> 00:25:41,839
See, for centuries,
diamonds were worthless

549
00:25:41,906 --> 00:25:43,875
until some very smart,
very rich people

550
00:25:43,942 --> 00:25:46,111
like Veronika here,
told us that, not only

551
00:25:46,177 --> 00:25:48,445
are these little shards
of glass rare,

552
00:25:48,512 --> 00:25:50,182
but that
no self-respecting couple

553
00:25:50,248 --> 00:25:51,549
could possibly get married
without one.

554
00:25:51,615 --> 00:25:53,751
No, now, that one is
a good magic trick.

555
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:56,421
The problem
with the trick is, um...

556
00:25:56,488 --> 00:25:59,057
All the good ones
have a little twist in the tale.

557
00:26:00,959 --> 00:26:02,027
Is it you?

558
00:26:03,094 --> 00:26:04,061
Is what me?

559
00:26:05,963 --> 00:26:07,731
- Of course not.
- No, no.

560
00:26:07,798 --> 00:26:09,701
I mean, you wouldn't have let
me in had I not demonstrated

561
00:26:09,768 --> 00:26:12,537
the finest moral fiber, like
some of your other guests.

562
00:26:12,604 --> 00:26:15,707
I notice Luis Briseno,
the arms dealer over there.

563
00:26:15,773 --> 00:26:16,942
Hello, sir.

564
00:26:17,008 --> 00:26:18,576
And of course, Maria Bortnick,
when starstruck,

565
00:26:18,643 --> 00:26:21,313
how she manages to mingle
while monopolizing her state media.

566
00:26:21,378 --> 00:26:23,647
Perhaps you'd care
to reveal yourself.

567
00:26:23,714 --> 00:26:26,218
Then we can apply
the same scrutiny to you.

568
00:26:26,284 --> 00:26:27,818
Hmm.

569
00:26:27,885 --> 00:26:30,055
Not just yet.

570
00:26:30,121 --> 00:26:31,489
I'm sorry for interrupting.

571
00:26:35,794 --> 00:26:36,994
That won't be necessary.

572
00:26:38,195 --> 00:26:39,263
Let him eat cake.

573
00:26:42,334 --> 00:26:44,001
Marc Schreiber.

574
00:26:44,068 --> 00:26:46,337
Veronika Vanderberg.

575
00:26:48,873 --> 00:26:50,307
Let's make this quick, shall we?

576
00:26:50,375 --> 00:26:52,009
Our auction begins shortly.

577
00:26:52,076 --> 00:26:54,078
I trust you can do me
and the Heart justice.

578
00:26:54,144 --> 00:26:57,582
Yes. I only have one rule.
What I say goes.

579
00:26:58,849 --> 00:27:01,219
Well, I'm sure I can
find my submissive side.

580
00:27:02,487 --> 00:27:05,522
Well, if not, I'll find it
for you.

581
00:27:06,590 --> 00:27:08,425
Ooh. I like you.

582
00:27:09,861 --> 00:27:10,929
Right this way, darling.

583
00:27:18,236 --> 00:27:20,337
- I don't want to be too matte.
- Sure. Sure, sure.

584
00:27:20,404 --> 00:27:22,173
And I don't like
the sides of my nose shining.

585
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:23,240
Okay.

586
00:27:23,875 --> 00:27:24,875
- Show me.
- Mm-hmm.

587
00:27:26,443 --> 00:27:28,346
Excuse me,
can the little fruit fly

588
00:27:28,413 --> 00:27:30,682
in my shot please shoo,
shoo, shoo.

589
00:27:30,750 --> 00:27:32,217
Thank you.

590
00:27:32,284 --> 00:27:34,786
The only thing more valuable
than that diamond is my time.

591
00:27:34,853 --> 00:27:37,690
I did my research on you.

592
00:27:37,757 --> 00:27:39,156
Your industry, like mine,

593
00:27:39,223 --> 00:27:41,792
is besieged
by manufacturer lore.

594
00:27:41,859 --> 00:27:45,963
But you, you bring us
beauty as it is.

595
00:27:47,231 --> 00:27:48,532
We're alike in that regard.

596
00:27:48,599 --> 00:27:52,537
We don't sell contrivance,
we sell reality.

597
00:27:52,604 --> 00:27:54,939
Well, I would argue
that we don't sell at all.

598
00:27:55,874 --> 00:27:57,008
Others buy.

599
00:27:57,075 --> 00:27:58,143
Hmm.

600
00:28:01,747 --> 00:28:02,946
Let's see...

601
00:28:04,750 --> 00:28:07,085
Uh... The diamond,
take it out.

602
00:28:07,951 --> 00:28:08,952
Nah, boy.

603
00:28:09,721 --> 00:28:11,588
Absolutely not.

604
00:28:11,656 --> 00:28:13,857
The glare in the glass
will mar the photos.

605
00:28:13,924 --> 00:28:15,527
I don't tolerate imperfections.

606
00:28:15,593 --> 00:28:16,827
I don't imagine
someone as ravishing

607
00:28:16,894 --> 00:28:18,663
as Ms. Vanderberg
does either.

608
00:28:18,730 --> 00:28:22,866
So, take it out or find
yourself a new photographer.

609
00:28:45,356 --> 00:28:47,025
In truth,
I was hoping you'd ask.

610
00:28:47,092 --> 00:28:48,728
I don't remember asking.

611
00:28:54,965 --> 00:28:57,102
There it is.

612
00:28:57,167 --> 00:29:00,070
Beautiful.
Work it. Fabulous.

613
00:29:00,137 --> 00:29:03,307
Fabulous.
Fabulous.

614
00:29:03,375 --> 00:29:04,642
Beautiful.

615
00:29:04,710 --> 00:29:08,380
Yes. Smiling,
we're having fun.

616
00:29:08,445 --> 00:29:10,414
This is what we came for.

617
00:29:12,384 --> 00:29:14,419
Hold it, hold it.

618
00:29:15,119 --> 00:29:17,087
That's the money shot.

619
00:29:17,888 --> 00:29:18,890
Hold it.

620
00:29:19,858 --> 00:29:22,661
And you, ma'am, are far enough.

621
00:29:22,728 --> 00:29:24,496
I'm just trying...
I'm trying to help.

622
00:29:24,561 --> 00:29:25,896
- Her forehead is shinier than the diamond.
- When it comes to the Heart...

623
00:29:25,963 --> 00:29:27,432
Actually, I'm doing my job.

624
00:29:27,499 --> 00:29:28,800
- I don't take orders from you.
- When it comes to the Heart,

625
00:29:28,867 --> 00:29:30,836
- you listen to me. Get out.
- I... I can walk myself.

626
00:29:30,902 --> 00:29:32,002
- Thank you.
- Right.

627
00:29:33,904 --> 00:29:36,173
Mr. Schreiber.

628
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:37,675
If you're all you purport to be,

629
00:29:37,742 --> 00:29:39,744
you should already have
what you need.

630
00:29:41,011 --> 00:29:43,615
- More than enough. Thank you.
- Excellent.

631
00:29:48,385 --> 00:29:52,289
Well, it's been a pleasure,
but I have buyers waiting.

632
00:29:52,356 --> 00:29:53,991
I've had enough
of this of this nonsense.

633
00:29:54,057 --> 00:29:55,093
Make sure it's secured.

634
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:56,961
Yes, Lethabo.

635
00:30:00,030 --> 00:30:02,032
- What the hell, what happened?
- I don't know. I don't know.

636
00:30:02,099 --> 00:30:03,769
Time's ticking. Let's go.

637
00:30:17,281 --> 00:30:21,118
At last, the auction
we've all been waiting for.

638
00:30:21,185 --> 00:30:22,487
Now, if you're here tonight,

639
00:30:22,554 --> 00:30:24,622
you probably think
you've seen everything.

640
00:30:24,690 --> 00:30:27,157
So it is to you that I ask...

641
00:30:28,693 --> 00:30:29,761
Everything?

642
00:30:33,364 --> 00:30:37,201
It's not been seen in person
for a quarter of a century.

643
00:30:37,268 --> 00:30:40,538
Still the largest diamond
ever discovered, the Heart.

644
00:30:47,045 --> 00:30:48,881
Congratulations to all of you

645
00:30:48,948 --> 00:30:51,249
and for getting away
with it for so long.

646
00:30:51,817 --> 00:30:53,518
Well, guess what?

647
00:30:53,585 --> 00:30:54,886
Climate change

648
00:30:54,953 --> 00:30:57,188
doesn't believe in you, either.

649
00:30:57,255 --> 00:30:59,758
You tore your fortunes
from our Mother Earth,

650
00:30:59,825 --> 00:31:02,928
set fire to her skies
in your private jets...

651
00:31:02,993 --> 00:31:04,561
- Okay, she gets it.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

652
00:31:06,096 --> 00:31:07,700
Bled her dry
with your insatiable...

653
00:31:07,766 --> 00:31:10,602
Young man, we all want
to save the world here,

654
00:31:10,669 --> 00:31:14,038
but time is also precious
and you're wasting mine.

655
00:31:14,105 --> 00:31:16,875
Zip it, sparkles.

656
00:31:16,942 --> 00:31:18,375
Why don't you stop sucking

657
00:31:18,442 --> 00:31:20,813
on plastic straws,
and suck on this!

658
00:31:29,420 --> 00:31:31,757
Honored guests.
My name is J. Daniel Atlas.

659
00:31:31,824 --> 00:31:34,192
You may remember me
as your personal favorite

660
00:31:34,259 --> 00:31:36,027
of the Four Horsemen of magic.

661
00:31:36,094 --> 00:31:40,565
Now watch closely as I make the famous
Heart Diamond appear on my palm.

662
00:31:40,632 --> 00:31:42,299
Gee-whiz, he must be as starved

663
00:31:42,366 --> 00:31:44,067
for attention
as Greenpeace here.

664
00:31:45,703 --> 00:31:48,472
Rest assured that the diamond
is completely safe.

665
00:31:49,140 --> 00:31:50,541
Is it?

666
00:31:50,607 --> 00:31:53,377
Now, a wise man once told me,
in the mirror, in fact,

667
00:31:53,443 --> 00:31:57,214
uh, never assume you're the smartest person
in the room, prove it.

668
00:31:57,281 --> 00:31:59,416
Be my guest.

669
00:31:59,483 --> 00:32:01,653
All right, well, let's see
if we can get that case open.

670
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:03,788
Uh... Abracadabra.

671
00:32:03,855 --> 00:32:06,025
Huh. Nope.
Uh... Alakazam.

672
00:32:06,724 --> 00:32:07,759
Wait.

673
00:32:09,294 --> 00:32:10,295
Open sesame.

674
00:32:12,564 --> 00:32:14,531
Ah.

675
00:32:17,836 --> 00:32:18,971
Still safe with me.

676
00:32:21,006 --> 00:32:23,407
No. Relax.
Mm, relax, Veronika.

677
00:32:23,473 --> 00:32:25,242
Now, as your ads
like to remind us,

678
00:32:25,309 --> 00:32:27,511
diamonds are forever.

679
00:32:27,578 --> 00:32:30,515
- Get her to safety. Now!
- You stop him! Stop him!

680
00:32:30,582 --> 00:32:31,583
Stop him!

681
00:32:34,551 --> 00:32:35,688
- Jack.
- Hey.

682
00:32:35,753 --> 00:32:37,957
- What are you doing here?
- Saving your ass.

683
00:32:38,022 --> 00:32:39,257
- Ah.
- You're welcome.

684
00:32:40,157 --> 00:32:41,625
You got one, too. Huh.

685
00:32:41,693 --> 00:32:43,028
- Hi. I'm June.
- Yeah.

686
00:32:43,094 --> 00:32:44,663
- Who's she?
- Sorry, she's with us.

687
00:32:48,032 --> 00:32:50,702
Where is the diamond?

688
00:32:56,607 --> 00:32:57,809
What?

689
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:31,743
I guess you guys don't care
about the environment.

690
00:33:31,809 --> 00:33:33,077
You're stronger than you look.

691
00:33:34,211 --> 00:33:35,212
Hey!

692
00:33:40,384 --> 00:33:41,486
Hey, hey. Hey!

693
00:33:41,551 --> 00:33:43,855
Stop! Don't let
them get away!

694
00:33:43,922 --> 00:33:45,355
Okay, what now?

695
00:33:45,423 --> 00:33:46,825
My card just said to get you
out of there. I don't know.

696
00:33:50,327 --> 00:33:52,497
Henley Reeves?

697
00:33:52,563 --> 00:33:54,265
I have so many posters of you.

698
00:33:54,332 --> 00:33:55,834
- You're my childhood...
- All right, fanboy later.

699
00:33:55,901 --> 00:33:58,368
But it does, uh... You know,
it is really nice to see you.

700
00:33:58,435 --> 00:34:01,204
Fanboy later.
We got to go up.

701
00:34:09,514 --> 00:34:11,115
Put your hands up
and don't move!

702
00:34:11,181 --> 00:34:13,085
This is some bullshit.

703
00:34:16,088 --> 00:34:17,789
What is happening?

704
00:34:17,856 --> 00:34:19,858
Beethoven's Concerto in D major.

705
00:34:21,025 --> 00:34:22,559
Bullshit, bullshit, bullshit!

706
00:34:23,929 --> 00:34:26,699
Whoa. Merritt? What...
What the hell was that?

707
00:34:26,764 --> 00:34:30,702
Atlas, I would like to see you hypnotize
three dudes in Belgian.

708
00:34:30,768 --> 00:34:31,737
You mean Flemish.

709
00:34:32,871 --> 00:34:34,072
Okay, that explains it.

710
00:34:34,139 --> 00:34:36,273
Lovely reunion.
We have to go.

711
00:34:36,340 --> 00:34:38,643
Henley Reeves!

712
00:34:38,710 --> 00:34:40,577
- Welcome back!
- Thanks.

713
00:34:40,644 --> 00:34:42,146
And may I say, you are...

714
00:34:42,213 --> 00:34:44,315
- Okay, come on, let's go!
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!

715
00:34:44,382 --> 00:34:45,918
I was paying her a compliment

716
00:34:45,983 --> 00:34:47,985
because it was nice
to see her, and only her.

717
00:34:48,052 --> 00:34:49,554
- I was...
- We get it!

718
00:34:54,126 --> 00:34:55,326
Up there.

719
00:34:59,630 --> 00:35:01,800
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
Is that for us?

720
00:35:01,867 --> 00:35:04,902
Do you see any other people
trying to escape?

721
00:35:04,969 --> 00:35:06,237
Come on, come on.
Go, go!

722
00:35:46,010 --> 00:35:47,211
Come on, come on.

723
00:35:50,447 --> 00:35:52,315
Uh, it was in my hand

724
00:35:52,382 --> 00:35:54,853
the whole time. It never...

725
00:35:54,920 --> 00:35:56,554
They didn't swap the diamond.

726
00:35:57,688 --> 00:35:59,556
They swapped the case.

727
00:35:59,623 --> 00:36:02,161
And you, ma'am, are far enough.

728
00:36:09,034 --> 00:36:13,336
Why don't you stop sucking
on plastic straws, and suck on this!

729
00:36:32,958 --> 00:36:34,092
Honored guests...

730
00:36:34,159 --> 00:36:35,326
Open sesame.

731
00:36:41,132 --> 00:36:42,201
Still safe with me.

732
00:36:44,434 --> 00:36:46,536
Diamonds are forever.

733
00:36:48,438 --> 00:36:51,375
- Lethabo.
- Yes, ma'am?

734
00:36:51,442 --> 00:36:53,376
We're going to
make them regret this.

735
00:36:54,746 --> 00:36:55,780
And then some.

736
00:36:56,815 --> 00:36:58,784
Marc Schreiber, <i>Vanity Fair.</i>

737
00:37:00,418 --> 00:37:02,221
What did I miss?

738
00:37:11,362 --> 00:37:13,563
You know,
I thought it'd be shinier.

739
00:37:13,630 --> 00:37:15,701
Okay.
All right, give it back.

740
00:37:15,766 --> 00:37:17,568
- Thank... What are you doing?
- Oh. Sorry. It's so slippery.

741
00:37:17,635 --> 00:37:18,635
- Hey. Hey.
- Heads up.

742
00:37:18,704 --> 00:37:19,938
Okay, don't do that again.

743
00:37:20,005 --> 00:37:23,373
Hey, can I address
the, uh, infant in the room?

744
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:25,443
Uh... Who are these guys?

745
00:37:25,509 --> 00:37:28,213
These are the wonderful kids
that deepfaked our show.

746
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:29,947
- What?
- Yeah.

747
00:37:30,014 --> 00:37:31,817
You had the cops
sent to my house?

748
00:37:31,884 --> 00:37:33,251
You freaked out my kids.

749
00:37:33,318 --> 00:37:34,920
- Yeah, sorry. Sorry about that.
- Sorry about that.

750
00:37:34,987 --> 00:37:36,387
How are the kids, though?

751
00:37:36,454 --> 00:37:38,389
How is the whole boring
suburban life you left us for?

752
00:37:38,456 --> 00:37:40,224
- Hey, relax, man. You missed your shot.
- Hmm.

753
00:37:40,291 --> 00:37:41,592
You see the size of that rock?

754
00:37:41,659 --> 00:37:42,927
No, let me see that.

755
00:37:42,994 --> 00:37:44,594
Ooh, it's no Heart diamond,
but it's impressive.

756
00:37:44,663 --> 00:37:46,764
I already told you, Danny.
I didn't feel safe

757
00:37:46,831 --> 00:37:49,634
trying to escape from a straitjacket
hanging upside down.

758
00:37:49,701 --> 00:37:51,235
I was six months pregnant.

759
00:37:51,302 --> 00:37:52,670
Come on, we would have flipped
you right side up at the end.

760
00:37:52,737 --> 00:37:53,838
You'd have been fine.

761
00:37:53,905 --> 00:37:55,273
- Come on.
- You guys didn't even miss me.

762
00:37:55,340 --> 00:37:57,976
How long did it take you
to replace me? An afternoon?

763
00:37:58,043 --> 00:38:00,278
Um, and the better part
of an evening.

764
00:38:00,344 --> 00:38:02,813
Hey, speaking of, how is Lula?

765
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:05,449
- Are you guys still, uh...
- No.

766
00:38:05,516 --> 00:38:06,918
She, uh...
she moved to Paris.

767
00:38:06,985 --> 00:38:09,186
Oh, no. She dumped
the great J. Wilder. My God.

768
00:38:09,253 --> 00:38:10,355
I'm sorry. My apologies.

769
00:38:10,420 --> 00:38:11,621
Don't you need to be
on some, like,

770
00:38:11,690 --> 00:38:12,791
cruise ship somewhere
humiliating yourself?

771
00:38:12,858 --> 00:38:14,358
- Humiliating myself?
- Yeah.

772
00:38:14,425 --> 00:38:16,695
I make five figures
per cruise, plus perks.

773
00:38:16,762 --> 00:38:18,297
"Plus perks."
He said, "plus perks."

774
00:38:18,362 --> 00:38:19,597
And I thought
Merritt drinking himself

775
00:38:19,664 --> 00:38:21,032
to death in Mexico
was depressing. Ooh.

776
00:38:21,099 --> 00:38:22,967
Speaking of,
I got to get back to it.

777
00:38:23,034 --> 00:38:25,536
This liver's
not gonna destroy itself.

778
00:38:26,737 --> 00:38:28,539
Uh, can we dry dock this thing?

779
00:38:28,606 --> 00:38:29,974
Wait, wait, wait.
You're leaving?

780
00:38:30,041 --> 00:38:32,277
Well, yeah, I mean,
great catching up.

781
00:38:32,344 --> 00:38:35,545
Um, I don't know, what,
see you in another ten?

782
00:38:35,612 --> 00:38:37,715
Nice to meet you,
little tadpoles.

783
00:38:37,782 --> 00:38:39,217
<i>Adios.</i>

784
00:38:39,284 --> 00:38:41,219
Yeah, you know what?
I'm out of here, too.

785
00:38:41,286 --> 00:38:42,320
I have a gig to get to.

786
00:38:42,387 --> 00:38:43,487
Really?
They're covering your Uber?

787
00:38:43,554 --> 00:38:45,423
Signed an NDA.
Can't say a word.

788
00:38:46,291 --> 00:38:47,490
What are you doing?

789
00:38:47,557 --> 00:38:49,559
Six handles
and none of them open it.

790
00:38:49,626 --> 00:38:51,461
Who do you think
you're talking to? Move.

791
00:38:51,528 --> 00:38:52,831
I'm sorry,
but I don't really know

792
00:38:52,898 --> 00:38:54,498
what's going on with you guys.

793
00:38:54,565 --> 00:38:56,001
I'm getting the feeling
there's a lot of weird history here,

794
00:38:56,068 --> 00:38:57,802
and things are a little awkward.

795
00:38:57,869 --> 00:39:00,905
Yeah, you guys,
you used to be the Horsemen.

796
00:39:02,206 --> 00:39:04,141
I don't get it.
Why did you break up?

797
00:39:04,208 --> 00:39:05,543
Ask them.
Ask them why we broke up.

798
00:39:05,608 --> 00:39:06,978
If it was up to me,
we wouldn't have.

799
00:39:10,547 --> 00:39:12,483
- The Eye wanted us to...
- No, no.

800
00:39:12,550 --> 00:39:15,019
...expose a Russian
arms dealer.

801
00:39:15,086 --> 00:39:16,887
Do we really have
to live through this again?

802
00:39:16,954 --> 00:39:19,358
We made some
huge mistakes, we got...

803
00:39:19,423 --> 00:39:21,693
- Sloppy.
- Cocky.

804
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:23,561
Because of us,
Dylan Shrike will never see

805
00:39:23,626 --> 00:39:25,262
the outside
of a Russian prison again.

806
00:39:25,329 --> 00:39:27,431
- Who?
- Dylan Shrike. Okay?

807
00:39:27,498 --> 00:39:29,668
He's a Horseman. Come on.
Do your homework, man.

808
00:39:29,735 --> 00:39:32,838
I'm so sorry.
Guys, I had no idea.

809
00:39:32,903 --> 00:39:34,239
What, he's stuck
in there forever?

810
00:39:34,306 --> 00:39:35,706
Which is obviously a tragedy

811
00:39:35,773 --> 00:39:36,875
and something
I'll never forgive myself.

812
00:39:36,942 --> 00:39:37,943
- Nor will I.
- Yeah, fine, man.

813
00:39:38,010 --> 00:39:39,077
But it didn't mean
you have to quit.

814
00:39:39,143 --> 00:39:42,014
Man, that is, uh...

815
00:39:42,079 --> 00:39:43,949
It's really a bummer, guys.
Sorry about that.

816
00:39:45,784 --> 00:39:46,985
"A bummer"?

817
00:39:48,152 --> 00:39:49,454
I... I... I love the way

818
00:39:49,519 --> 00:39:53,523
your generation
sums things up so eloquently.

819
00:39:53,590 --> 00:39:55,393
I mean, someone explain to me

820
00:39:55,460 --> 00:39:57,461
why these pre-pubes
are even here.

821
00:39:57,527 --> 00:39:59,130
Same reason you are, man.

822
00:39:59,998 --> 00:40:01,166
The Eye wanted 'em.

823
00:40:02,199 --> 00:40:03,467
Well, we got the Heart.

824
00:40:03,534 --> 00:40:05,202
What does The Eye
want us to do next?

825
00:40:05,269 --> 00:40:07,271
- No idea.
- I know one thing.

826
00:40:07,338 --> 00:40:10,574
You've got a half a billion
dollar diamond in your hands.

827
00:40:10,641 --> 00:40:12,643
- They're gonna get in touch.
- Yeah, probably.

828
00:40:12,710 --> 00:40:15,012
Whoa, wait, wait.
Atlas, can I see your card?

829
00:40:15,545 --> 00:40:16,579
Yeah.

830
00:40:22,387 --> 00:40:23,722
Hmm.

831
00:40:23,789 --> 00:40:25,056
- Whoa.
- It's a map.

832
00:40:25,123 --> 00:40:28,393
- Hey, Atlas, it's your dad.
- No, it's...

833
00:40:28,460 --> 00:40:30,094
It's a map that
only reveals itself

834
00:40:30,161 --> 00:40:32,664
when the Horsemen are together.

835
00:40:34,498 --> 00:40:36,768
- Fat chance.
- Really, dude?

836
00:40:36,835 --> 00:40:40,137
I mean, come on, The Eye obviously wants
you guys to do this.

837
00:40:40,204 --> 00:40:42,373
You're the Horsemen.
Start acting like it.

838
00:40:47,311 --> 00:40:48,447
All right.

839
00:40:48,512 --> 00:40:51,248
I suppose Rosarito
can wait a couple days.

840
00:40:53,385 --> 00:40:56,188
I... I can try to reschedule
this gig.

841
00:40:56,253 --> 00:40:58,523
It's not gonna be easy,
but I'll figure it out.

842
00:40:59,990 --> 00:41:01,960
I mean, I have kind of missed
running for my life

843
00:41:02,027 --> 00:41:03,762
and jumping off roofs
with you guys.

844
00:41:03,829 --> 00:41:06,331
- It's good to have you back.
- Thanks.

845
00:41:06,398 --> 00:41:08,333
Okay, so where is this place?

846
00:41:19,077 --> 00:41:20,945
What are we
supposed to be doing here?

847
00:41:21,012 --> 00:41:23,347
The Eye will let us know.

848
00:41:23,414 --> 00:41:25,182
- All right, picture time.
- What are you doing?

849
00:41:25,250 --> 00:41:26,550
Taking a photo.
That's what couples do now.

850
00:41:26,617 --> 00:41:27,952
Please don't post photos

851
00:41:28,018 --> 00:41:28,786
- of the top secret location.
- Don't be jealous.

852
00:41:28,853 --> 00:41:29,954
I know you want to be in it.

853
00:41:30,021 --> 00:41:31,322
Yeah.
I don't want to be in it.

854
00:41:31,389 --> 00:41:32,891
- Because it can be used for...
- For memories.

855
00:41:32,958 --> 00:41:34,226
No, not memories.
Evidence.

856
00:41:38,262 --> 00:41:40,599
Huh. I've never
seen a door like this.

857
00:41:42,467 --> 00:41:44,969
Okay, I can't open it.

858
00:41:45,769 --> 00:41:47,172
You got this, Jack?

859
00:41:47,239 --> 00:41:49,074
Wait.
Don't you mean "June"?

860
00:41:49,141 --> 00:41:51,543
- Jack's our lockpick.
- Whoa.

861
00:41:51,610 --> 00:41:54,246
Looks like a little
healthy competish.

862
00:41:54,311 --> 00:41:55,646
Come on, this isn't fair.

863
00:41:55,713 --> 00:41:57,315
I've been picking locks
since before she was born.

864
00:41:59,583 --> 00:42:01,085
Let me find the keyhole.

865
00:42:01,152 --> 00:42:04,054
- Maybe the other side.
- Yeah, it's underneath.

866
00:42:04,121 --> 00:42:06,056
You're not inspiring
confidence right now, Jack.

867
00:42:06,123 --> 00:42:07,559
- He's got it.
- Hmm.

868
00:42:07,626 --> 00:42:09,094
- He's got it.
- Feeling rusty?

869
00:42:09,161 --> 00:42:10,161
Don't rush me.

870
00:42:11,295 --> 00:42:14,099
When does he start
the lock picking?

871
00:42:14,166 --> 00:42:16,735
Hey, Jack, I don't think
this is a lock you pick.

872
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:19,003
I think it's a lock
you solve. So...

873
00:42:23,175 --> 00:42:24,909
Show him how it's done.

874
00:42:24,976 --> 00:42:26,277
Whoa.

875
00:42:26,344 --> 00:42:28,045
Do you mind if I just figure
this out real quickly?

876
00:42:30,648 --> 00:42:31,949
Okay.

877
00:42:36,621 --> 00:42:38,690
If you've ever done
an escape room,

878
00:42:38,757 --> 00:42:41,726
you'd know there are all kinds
of different puzzles.

879
00:42:42,860 --> 00:42:45,230
It's not just about
locks and keys.

880
00:42:45,297 --> 00:42:46,565
- Whoa.
- Huh.

881
00:42:46,630 --> 00:42:48,266
You might want to
update your game, Jack.

882
00:42:48,333 --> 00:42:49,367
Whoa.

883
00:42:49,434 --> 00:42:52,170
But, by all means, lead the way.

884
00:42:54,438 --> 00:42:56,574
I think he loosened it
for her, ultimately.

885
00:42:57,375 --> 00:42:58,809
- Huh.
- Ooh.

886
00:42:59,710 --> 00:43:01,146
- Whoa.
- Wow.

887
00:43:01,213 --> 00:43:02,380
Uh, what is this place?

888
00:43:02,981 --> 00:43:04,416
Magic nerd heaven.

889
00:43:04,481 --> 00:43:06,016
P.T. Selbit's coffin?

890
00:43:07,985 --> 00:43:08,987
See?

891
00:43:09,054 --> 00:43:11,056
Guys, Houdini's straitjacket.

892
00:43:11,121 --> 00:43:12,324
Yes, it is.

893
00:43:12,389 --> 00:43:14,559
Hey, can I put you in here
for old time's sake?

894
00:43:14,626 --> 00:43:16,094
- No.
- No?

895
00:43:16,161 --> 00:43:17,161
I thought it was funny.

896
00:43:17,228 --> 00:43:18,429
Thanks a lot.
You wanna come in?

897
00:43:19,231 --> 00:43:21,132
- No.
- Right.

898
00:43:24,568 --> 00:43:26,471
Charlie, check this out, dude.

899
00:43:26,538 --> 00:43:27,539
What is it?

900
00:43:28,072 --> 00:43:29,173
Bullet catch.

901
00:43:29,240 --> 00:43:30,407
No way!

902
00:43:31,009 --> 00:43:33,210
Yo!

903
00:43:48,159 --> 00:43:50,094
- Dead end?
- Yeah, dead end.

904
00:43:50,161 --> 00:43:52,463
Hey, guys, dead end.

905
00:43:52,530 --> 00:43:54,365
- Or, is it?
- Hmm.

906
00:43:57,601 --> 00:43:58,802
Oh, my God.

907
00:44:01,373 --> 00:44:02,373
Yeah, it is.

908
00:44:06,043 --> 00:44:07,045
Hmm, that's weird.

909
00:44:10,047 --> 00:44:14,152
The die should be here
and the ball should be here.

910
00:44:19,724 --> 00:44:21,826
- Whoa.
- Well played.

911
00:44:21,893 --> 00:44:22,893
It's nothing.

912
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:24,028
Four rows.

913
00:44:24,094 --> 00:44:27,498
One, five, eight, four?
Is it a code?

914
00:44:27,565 --> 00:44:29,967
- One, one, five, six, 18...
- Minus four.

915
00:44:30,034 --> 00:44:31,036
- One, eight, nine?
- Fifteen, eighty-four.

916
00:44:31,101 --> 00:44:32,637
- 1584.
- Wha...

917
00:44:32,704 --> 00:44:34,204
<i>The Discoverie of Witchcraft.</i>

918
00:44:34,271 --> 00:44:35,507
It's the first book
on stage magic.

919
00:44:35,572 --> 00:44:36,574
It's when it was published.

920
00:44:36,641 --> 00:44:38,143
God, how does he know that?

921
00:44:38,208 --> 00:44:40,478
Uh, he's basically a computer
full of useless information.

922
00:44:40,545 --> 00:44:41,813
Huh.

923
00:44:52,757 --> 00:44:53,824
"Useless"?

924
00:44:58,329 --> 00:44:59,530
This is cool.

925
00:45:02,967 --> 00:45:05,302
- Unreal.
- Nice.

926
00:45:16,581 --> 00:45:18,949
Hey, guys, it's the floor plan
of the chateau.

927
00:45:19,784 --> 00:45:21,786
But it's different somehow.

928
00:45:23,954 --> 00:45:25,489
Up is down.

929
00:45:26,659 --> 00:45:28,693
Left is right.

930
00:45:30,695 --> 00:45:32,297
Even the rooms are tricks.

931
00:45:35,532 --> 00:45:36,634
My Horsemen.

932
00:45:36,702 --> 00:45:38,436
Thaddeus!

933
00:45:39,871 --> 00:45:41,905
- So good to see you.
- So good to see you, darling.

934
00:45:41,972 --> 00:45:44,608
You could've just checked the Ring camera
and buzzed us in.

935
00:45:44,677 --> 00:45:46,643
Now, where's the fun in that?

936
00:45:46,711 --> 00:45:48,713
Sir. Hi, I'm Charlie.

937
00:45:48,780 --> 00:45:51,416
- I'm such a big fan of yours.
- Hi, Charlie.

938
00:45:51,483 --> 00:45:52,751
Um...

939
00:45:52,818 --> 00:45:54,918
I've never seen a Lubor Lens
this big in person.

940
00:45:54,985 --> 00:45:57,655
Really? Well, you ain't
seen nothing yet.

941
00:45:59,958 --> 00:46:01,659
So you sent the tarot cards?

942
00:46:01,726 --> 00:46:02,927
No.

943
00:46:02,994 --> 00:46:05,597
No, I've long since given up
such foolishness,

944
00:46:05,664 --> 00:46:07,733
and your collective dysfunction.

945
00:46:08,900 --> 00:46:11,135
No, the only magic I do nowadays

946
00:46:11,202 --> 00:46:12,603
is for my grandchildren.

947
00:46:14,371 --> 00:46:16,240
Some weeks ago, however,

948
00:46:16,306 --> 00:46:18,677
a card did appear
on my doorstep,

949
00:46:20,210 --> 00:46:23,181
warning me to prepare
this chateau

950
00:46:23,248 --> 00:46:28,619
for the arrival of seven soon-to-be
fugitives from the law.

951
00:46:28,686 --> 00:46:30,088
- That tracks.
- Yeah.

952
00:46:30,155 --> 00:46:31,856
Wait, so why does
The Eye want us here?

953
00:46:31,922 --> 00:46:33,925
Well, I can only assume
that whatever it is

954
00:46:33,992 --> 00:46:35,760
they want you to do next,

955
00:46:35,827 --> 00:46:37,896
is hidden somewhere
in these walls.

956
00:46:39,264 --> 00:46:43,268
See, this chateau,
Chateau Roussillon

957
00:46:43,333 --> 00:46:44,670
used to be their home.

958
00:46:44,737 --> 00:46:47,204
In 1943,

959
00:46:47,271 --> 00:46:51,608
the Allies needed military
miracles from every source.

960
00:46:53,077 --> 00:46:55,380
They enlisted the aid

961
00:46:55,447 --> 00:46:58,615
of some of the most talented
magicians of the time.

962
00:46:58,684 --> 00:47:03,121
They built a whole city
using mud, cardboard, lights,

963
00:47:03,188 --> 00:47:06,157
thousands
of inflatable rubber tanks

964
00:47:06,224 --> 00:47:08,326
to misdirect the Germans.

965
00:47:08,393 --> 00:47:10,295
The genius of Jasper Maskelyne.

966
00:47:10,360 --> 00:47:13,465
Somebody knows his history.

967
00:47:13,530 --> 00:47:16,134
Wait, so, what do the Nazis
have to do with the diamond?

968
00:47:17,469 --> 00:47:19,170
That, I do not know.

969
00:47:19,237 --> 00:47:21,840
But the answer
is here somewhere.

970
00:47:23,541 --> 00:47:25,076
We just have to start looking.

971
00:47:27,813 --> 00:47:29,414
Ms. Vanderberg.
Ms. Vanderberg.

972
00:47:29,481 --> 00:47:31,215
How do you respond to
the rumors that your company

973
00:47:31,282 --> 00:47:33,050
is nothing but a front
for money laundering?

974
00:47:33,117 --> 00:47:34,318
The Horsemen are thieves

975
00:47:34,385 --> 00:47:37,222
posing as
anti-capitalist entertainers,

976
00:47:37,288 --> 00:47:40,492
and they have unfairly targeted me
and my good company.

977
00:47:40,557 --> 00:47:43,327
I challenge anyone
who maligns us to look

978
00:47:43,393 --> 00:47:45,664
closely at our operations
and our books.

979
00:47:45,731 --> 00:47:48,365
And I challenge police
to put those magicians

980
00:47:48,432 --> 00:47:50,601
back where they belong,
in the past.

981
00:47:51,836 --> 00:47:53,271
All right, no more questions.

982
00:47:53,338 --> 00:47:55,507
No more questions, please!
Thank you!

983
00:48:09,822 --> 00:48:13,056
Interpol said
it was an inside job.

984
00:48:13,123 --> 00:48:15,293
Thieves knew exactly
where the blind spots were.

985
00:48:20,264 --> 00:48:22,233
<i>- How was it?</i>
- Let me guess.

986
00:48:22,300 --> 00:48:23,601
You're the one
behind these Horsemen

987
00:48:23,668 --> 00:48:25,704
and their little stable hands.

988
00:48:25,771 --> 00:48:26,972
<i>No. Why would I ask
for the diamond</i>

989
00:48:27,038 --> 00:48:28,172
<i>and then try to steal it?</i>

990
00:48:29,541 --> 00:48:31,409
<i>If I were you,
I'd figure out a way</i>

991
00:48:31,476 --> 00:48:32,978
<i>to get it back, and fast.</i>

992
00:48:34,177 --> 00:48:35,880
<i>I understand that
you and your race team</i>

993
00:48:35,947 --> 00:48:37,614
<i>will be in Abu Dhabi
later this week.</i>

994
00:48:37,682 --> 00:48:39,583
<i>A perfect neutral ground.</i>

995
00:48:39,650 --> 00:48:40,885
<i>I'll bring my evidence.</i>

996
00:48:40,952 --> 00:48:43,588
<i>You bring your Heart,
if you have one.</i>

997
00:48:43,655 --> 00:48:45,222
I...

998
00:48:47,324 --> 00:48:49,929
- Have you found them yet?
- We do have a few leads.

999
00:48:49,994 --> 00:48:52,429
They were seen headed
south out of Belgium.

1000
00:48:52,496 --> 00:48:53,498
Now they're saying the Horsemen

1001
00:48:53,565 --> 00:48:56,400
have been seen in France
one hour ago.

1002
00:48:56,467 --> 00:48:58,469
The head of the
French police owes me.

1003
00:48:58,536 --> 00:49:02,206
Just call him and say that I want these
Horsemen's heads served up on a platter.

1004
00:49:02,273 --> 00:49:05,409
The gendarme will find them.
I'm sure of it.

1005
00:49:07,012 --> 00:49:08,512
Thaddeus told us
to look for something.

1006
00:49:08,579 --> 00:49:09,914
What do you think it is?

1007
00:49:13,184 --> 00:49:14,786
Oh, wow. This is cool.

1008
00:49:16,688 --> 00:49:18,389
You are not a big talker.

1009
00:49:19,257 --> 00:49:20,592
Oh. Sorry.

1010
00:49:20,659 --> 00:49:22,661
But you are a big apologizer.

1011
00:49:22,728 --> 00:49:24,963
Sorry.
I just did it again.

1012
00:49:25,030 --> 00:49:26,998
Sorry. I mean...
I'm just nervous.

1013
00:49:27,065 --> 00:49:28,833
I'm a big fan of you guys.

1014
00:49:28,900 --> 00:49:31,635
And I got the cops called in,
and I'm really...

1015
00:49:32,704 --> 00:49:34,472
I'm really...
I'm not gonna say it.

1016
00:49:34,539 --> 00:49:36,675
You're forgiven.

1017
00:49:36,742 --> 00:49:39,177
And you guys made
the Horsemen look good.

1018
00:49:39,242 --> 00:49:42,179
But I didn't see you.
Why weren't you in it?

1019
00:49:42,246 --> 00:49:45,483
Oh, I just... I prefer to be
behind the scenes, you know.

1020
00:49:46,416 --> 00:49:47,952
I design all of our tricks.

1021
00:49:48,019 --> 00:49:50,454
Um, where are we going?
I feel like we're lost.

1022
00:49:50,521 --> 00:49:53,123
Do you really prefer that, or is that
just something you hide behind?

1023
00:49:53,925 --> 00:49:55,661
Uh, what do you mean?

1024
00:49:56,460 --> 00:49:58,496
Well, I... Whoa.

1025
00:49:58,563 --> 00:50:01,666
For years, I told myself
I wanted to be an assistant,

1026
00:50:01,733 --> 00:50:03,835
that I didn't mind
being upstaged by Atlas,

1027
00:50:03,902 --> 00:50:05,036
'cause he's so brilliant.

1028
00:50:05,103 --> 00:50:07,972
But really, I just...
I was afraid.

1029
00:50:09,239 --> 00:50:12,143
I was afraid
to take the spotlight.

1030
00:50:15,981 --> 00:50:19,182
Ooh. Thaddeus was right.
Up is down.

1031
00:50:29,927 --> 00:50:32,429
Upside down room. Cool.

1032
00:50:33,463 --> 00:50:34,900
Cool?

1033
00:50:34,967 --> 00:50:36,835
Is nothing impressive to you?

1034
00:50:36,902 --> 00:50:39,038
That's why I said "cool."

1035
00:50:39,103 --> 00:50:40,773
Do you not know what cool means?

1036
00:50:40,838 --> 00:50:43,340
All right, let's just try to figure out
how this room works, okay?

1037
00:50:43,809 --> 00:50:44,809
Yeah.

1038
00:50:50,481 --> 00:50:51,784
Figured it out.

1039
00:50:51,849 --> 00:50:53,851
Of course. That's right.
You know everything already.

1040
00:50:53,918 --> 00:50:55,353
So what did I
do wrong this time?

1041
00:50:55,420 --> 00:50:57,722
Ah, nothing.
My apologies.

1042
00:50:57,789 --> 00:50:59,356
You're amazing.
It's an honor to watch you.

1043
00:51:01,126 --> 00:51:03,061
Has anyone ever told you
that you're a control freak?

1044
00:51:03,128 --> 00:51:04,163
Yep. Many times.

1045
00:51:09,934 --> 00:51:11,436
Whoa! Hey!

1046
00:51:14,706 --> 00:51:16,007
I did figure it out.

1047
00:51:23,648 --> 00:51:25,516
Whoa. Wow.

1048
00:51:38,396 --> 00:51:39,697
Gummies kicked in.

1049
00:51:44,635 --> 00:51:46,304
I wonder what we're looking for.

1050
00:51:46,369 --> 00:51:48,005
Anything weird.

1051
00:51:48,072 --> 00:51:50,007
This is all weird.
Jesus.

1052
00:51:51,009 --> 00:51:52,010
Look at this.

1053
00:51:56,748 --> 00:51:59,016
You know, I have always
looked up to you.

1054
00:51:59,083 --> 00:52:00,351
Oh, yeah?

1055
00:52:00,418 --> 00:52:02,820
Yeah, before you became
a cruise ship magician.

1056
00:52:02,887 --> 00:52:04,621
Hey, I also do corporate events.

1057
00:52:04,690 --> 00:52:06,257
Oh, no way.
I couldn't tell.

1058
00:52:08,059 --> 00:52:10,360
So that was
a total waste. What now?

1059
00:52:10,427 --> 00:52:11,963
One trick. Okay? No charm,

1060
00:52:12,030 --> 00:52:13,798
no gifts of gabs.
Just one trick.

1061
00:52:13,865 --> 00:52:15,967
Dude, I do not
have to prove myself to you.

1062
00:52:16,034 --> 00:52:17,135
I mean, you kind of do.

1063
00:52:17,202 --> 00:52:18,402
Show me why The Eye picked you.

1064
00:52:19,536 --> 00:52:21,338
You know what?

1065
00:52:21,405 --> 00:52:23,440
Prove to me that
you don't need a babysitter.

1066
00:52:25,744 --> 00:52:27,813
Oh, what,
now you stop performing?

1067
00:52:27,880 --> 00:52:30,114
You're done showing off
because your misfit friends aren't here?

1068
00:52:30,181 --> 00:52:32,016
- They're my family.
- Mm-hmm.

1069
00:52:32,083 --> 00:52:33,786
Don't you dare.
I don't have to impress them.

1070
00:52:33,851 --> 00:52:34,987
All right, fine.
Forget it.

1071
00:52:35,052 --> 00:52:36,286
I just wanted to see
what you were capable of

1072
00:52:36,353 --> 00:52:37,822
when you weren't trying
to win cheap applause,

1073
00:52:37,889 --> 00:52:40,159
but I guess
the answer is nothing.

1074
00:52:43,027 --> 00:52:46,297
All right.
You wanna see a magic trick?

1075
00:52:46,364 --> 00:52:47,900
See, the problem
with you, Atlas,

1076
00:52:47,965 --> 00:52:50,802
is that you just like to
overcomplicate things, man.

1077
00:52:50,869 --> 00:52:55,139
It is a lot easier to find
a diamond than you think.

1078
00:52:55,206 --> 00:52:57,407
- Ooh.
- And to make it...

1079
00:52:57,976 --> 00:52:59,010
...disappear.

1080
00:52:59,077 --> 00:53:00,510
- Nice.
- Check your pocket.

1081
00:53:00,577 --> 00:53:01,579
- Really?
- Yeah.

1082
00:53:01,646 --> 00:53:03,248
Hmm.

1083
00:53:03,313 --> 00:53:06,184
Ooh, not bad.
Card to impossible location.

1084
00:53:06,251 --> 00:53:07,686
But don't play checkers
on a chessboard

1085
00:53:07,753 --> 00:53:09,855
because I'm already
five steps ahead of you.

1086
00:53:09,922 --> 00:53:10,956
Check your pocket.

1087
00:53:12,657 --> 00:53:13,858
Hey.

1088
00:53:13,925 --> 00:53:16,561
- Those are priceless antiques.
- Yeah.

1089
00:53:16,626 --> 00:53:18,362
This room is where old relics

1090
00:53:18,429 --> 00:53:20,164
go to their final resting place.

1091
00:53:20,231 --> 00:53:23,835
Yep. You are, uh... You're
probably right, Thaddeus.

1092
00:53:23,902 --> 00:53:27,773
But, uh, not before they have
one last shot at glory.

1093
00:53:27,840 --> 00:53:29,208
- What's going on here?
- Pretty good,

1094
00:53:29,273 --> 00:53:31,409
but you should try to do
things a little more slow.

1095
00:53:31,474 --> 00:53:34,679
- Really?
- Let your audience enjoy the real magic.

1096
00:53:34,746 --> 00:53:35,880
Okay,

1097
00:53:35,947 --> 00:53:37,014
- not bad. Not bad.
- Wow.

1098
00:53:37,081 --> 00:53:38,217
Nice one, Bosco.

1099
00:53:38,282 --> 00:53:39,885
I've never been great at poker,

1100
00:53:39,952 --> 00:53:44,188
but is a diamond
trumped by a heart?

1101
00:53:45,324 --> 00:53:47,458
- Ooh. There it is.
- Whoo.

1102
00:53:47,525 --> 00:53:49,862
Nice misdirection,
but, let's not forget

1103
00:53:49,927 --> 00:53:51,461
- what this is really about.
- I wasn't done.

1104
00:53:51,528 --> 00:53:54,398
- Show 'em, Charlie.
- Making a jewel disappear.

1105
00:53:54,465 --> 00:53:55,733
- Let's see this one.
- All right.

1106
00:53:55,800 --> 00:53:57,902
Keep your eye on the prize.

1107
00:53:57,969 --> 00:54:01,739
Round and round they go,
where they stop, nobody knows.

1108
00:54:01,806 --> 00:54:04,076
- Good as gone.
- Ooh.

1109
00:54:04,141 --> 00:54:06,978
Black art, table's rigged,
saw it when I came in.

1110
00:54:07,045 --> 00:54:09,248
- Time for a clean escape.
- Oh, yeah.

1111
00:54:09,313 --> 00:54:11,481
- Where is he going?
- I know what he's doing.

1112
00:54:13,150 --> 00:54:15,353
Jack in the box?
That's a trick?

1113
00:54:16,621 --> 00:54:18,757
Ah, it's old stuff.

1114
00:54:18,824 --> 00:54:21,226
If I had known he was that
easy to get rid of.

1115
00:54:21,293 --> 00:54:22,894
- Not that easy.
- Yeah, Jack.

1116
00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:25,463
Ohh! Okay, enough
of the warm up act,

1117
00:54:25,528 --> 00:54:26,965
time for the headliner.

1118
00:54:27,032 --> 00:54:30,168
I want you to think
of one of these cards,

1119
00:54:30,235 --> 00:54:34,273
but don't think of the one you
think I want you to think of.

1120
00:54:34,338 --> 00:54:35,840
- Got one?
- Yeah, I got one.

1121
00:54:37,407 --> 00:54:39,577
- What was your card?
- Four of hearts.

1122
00:54:40,878 --> 00:54:42,179
Ha-ha.

1123
00:54:42,246 --> 00:54:45,150
Nice one, professor.
I'm impressed. I'm impressed.

1124
00:54:45,217 --> 00:54:47,485
Hey. Hey. That whiskey
is older than you.

1125
00:54:47,550 --> 00:54:49,788
Sorry, boss. So sorry.

1126
00:54:49,855 --> 00:54:51,088
Look, you guys,
I'm not gonna lie.

1127
00:54:51,155 --> 00:54:52,456
This has been really cool.

1128
00:54:52,523 --> 00:54:53,992
- Really, really cool.
- Go show 'em.

1129
00:54:54,059 --> 00:54:57,427
But, uh, I think I just want
to make it a little cooler.

1130
00:54:57,494 --> 00:54:58,931
- Come on now, yeah!
- Hey.

1131
00:54:58,996 --> 00:55:00,865
- There she goes.
- Yes! Snow storm in China.

1132
00:55:03,001 --> 00:55:04,434
There we are.
Beautiful.

1133
00:55:05,568 --> 00:55:07,672
I always wear white
in winter, guys.

1134
00:55:07,739 --> 00:55:10,375
Snow is rare
in this part of France,

1135
00:55:10,440 --> 00:55:13,945
but, ice,
that is just impossible.

1136
00:55:16,914 --> 00:55:18,282
- Classic.
- Nice.

1137
00:55:18,349 --> 00:55:19,449
How do you do a vanish so good?

1138
00:55:19,516 --> 00:55:21,320
- Oh, a magician never tells.
- Hmm?

1139
00:55:22,086 --> 00:55:23,487
- Ooh. Hmm.
- Check.

1140
00:55:24,289 --> 00:55:25,289
Mate?

1141
00:55:25,757 --> 00:55:27,525
Shit.

1142
00:55:27,590 --> 00:55:31,528
Face it, Bosco. Wisdom and skill
overcome youth and arrogance every time.

1143
00:55:31,594 --> 00:55:34,699
Thank you. Never assume
you're the smartest guy in the room. Prove it.

1144
00:55:34,766 --> 00:55:36,867
Give me a break, man.
You didn't prove anything.

1145
00:55:36,934 --> 00:55:38,036
Hey, can I just remind everyone

1146
00:55:38,103 --> 00:55:39,304
we still haven't figured out

1147
00:55:39,371 --> 00:55:41,539
why we're even in this
World War II relic.

1148
00:55:41,605 --> 00:55:42,807
Wait!

1149
00:55:44,141 --> 00:55:45,344
Jasper Maskelyne,

1150
00:55:45,409 --> 00:55:47,378
the... the magician
who vanquished the Nazis.

1151
00:55:47,445 --> 00:55:50,849
He built fake cities,
fake tanks.

1152
00:55:50,916 --> 00:55:52,851
I mean... I wonder...

1153
00:56:05,130 --> 00:56:06,398
- Whoa.
- Oh.

1154
00:56:06,465 --> 00:56:07,530
Oh, wow.

1155
00:56:11,836 --> 00:56:13,405
Oh, my God, I was right?

1156
00:56:13,472 --> 00:56:15,340
Hey, Magic 101, man,
never act surprised

1157
00:56:15,407 --> 00:56:16,875
when the trick actually works.

1158
00:56:16,942 --> 00:56:18,275
Oh, sorry.

1159
00:56:24,849 --> 00:56:26,784
- Oh, my goodness.
- What is all that?

1160
00:56:26,851 --> 00:56:28,853
Encyclopedia
of Nazi war criminals.

1161
00:56:28,920 --> 00:56:32,190
Uh, which apparently includes
Veronika's dad.

1162
00:56:32,257 --> 00:56:34,960
After World War II, surviving
Nazis fled around the world.

1163
00:56:35,027 --> 00:56:37,561
I'm not an accountant, but looks like
Peter Vanderberg

1164
00:56:37,628 --> 00:56:39,764
got rich cleaning
their dirty money.

1165
00:56:39,831 --> 00:56:41,298
Yeah, and apparently
Veronika took over

1166
00:56:41,365 --> 00:56:43,567
right where he left off
using his criminal network.

1167
00:56:43,634 --> 00:56:45,137
But...
But I don't understand.

1168
00:56:45,202 --> 00:56:46,536
What does The Eye
want us to do with this?

1169
00:56:46,603 --> 00:56:48,639
Well, if I'm not mistaken,

1170
00:56:50,007 --> 00:56:53,643
The Eye wants us
to unmask the Vanderbergs,

1171
00:56:53,711 --> 00:56:56,947
bring down
two generations of criminals

1172
00:56:57,014 --> 00:56:58,581
with a single sleight of hand.

1173
00:56:58,648 --> 00:56:59,985
I've read
some interesting rumors

1174
00:57:00,052 --> 00:57:02,119
about the Vanderbergs online.

1175
00:57:02,186 --> 00:57:05,456
Looks like 15 years ago,
Veronika's mom killed herself,

1176
00:57:05,523 --> 00:57:07,992
and a week later, their housekeeper's
brakes failed.

1177
00:57:09,061 --> 00:57:11,128
Her car crashed,
she and her son died.

1178
00:57:11,195 --> 00:57:13,065
There was some suspicion
of foul play,

1179
00:57:13,130 --> 00:57:15,166
but nothing was ever proven.

1180
00:57:15,233 --> 00:57:16,567
Hmm.

1181
00:57:16,634 --> 00:57:18,402
- Whoa.
- Oh, shit.

1182
00:57:26,643 --> 00:57:27,644
Police!

1183
00:57:27,711 --> 00:57:29,815
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

1184
00:57:29,880 --> 00:57:31,349
Listen closely.

1185
00:57:31,416 --> 00:57:33,985
- Split up, find a way out.
- Okay.

1186
00:57:34,052 --> 00:57:35,686
- Come on, let's go.
- Go. Go.

1187
00:57:35,753 --> 00:57:36,822
- He's right. Everybody split up.
- Okay, let's go.

1188
00:57:57,141 --> 00:57:58,210
This way, this way!

1189
00:58:01,079 --> 00:58:02,481
Stop!

1190
00:58:08,219 --> 00:58:09,753
- Turn around.
- Turn around.

1191
00:58:12,257 --> 00:58:14,893
You heard him, Bosco.
Turn around.

1192
00:58:24,369 --> 00:58:25,336
Here they come!

1193
00:58:51,963 --> 00:58:53,030
<i>Adios, mon ami.</i>

1194
00:59:16,655 --> 00:59:17,657
Sorry!

1195
00:59:19,925 --> 00:59:23,360
<i>Bonjour, monsieur. Bonjour.</i>

1196
00:59:23,427 --> 00:59:25,063
You know,
normally, I like to give

1197
00:59:25,130 --> 00:59:26,864
a proper tour to new guests.

1198
00:59:28,766 --> 00:59:30,568
I suspect you've discovered

1199
00:59:30,635 --> 00:59:33,137
that this house
holds many secrets.

1200
00:59:33,204 --> 00:59:34,206
Thaddeus!

1201
00:59:41,045 --> 00:59:42,047
Thaddeus!

1202
00:59:45,115 --> 00:59:46,585
Would you like to see
a magic trick?

1203
00:59:48,786 --> 00:59:51,623
How about if I make myself...

1204
00:59:51,690 --> 00:59:53,257
disappear?

1205
00:59:53,324 --> 00:59:54,525
Don't move!

1206
00:59:56,994 --> 00:59:57,996
Thaddeus!

1207
01:00:12,844 --> 01:00:14,612
Thaddeus!

1208
01:00:23,387 --> 01:00:24,755
Hurry! This way!

1209
01:00:26,090 --> 01:00:27,092
Thaddeus?

1210
01:00:28,059 --> 01:00:29,193
Oh, thank God.

1211
01:00:29,260 --> 01:00:30,730
Hey, which is
the fastest way out of here?

1212
01:00:32,030 --> 01:00:34,199
- Around this bend...
- Yeah.

1213
01:00:34,266 --> 01:00:37,335
...there's a passageway.

1214
01:00:37,402 --> 01:00:40,438
Just follow the creek
through the forest.

1215
01:00:41,706 --> 01:00:43,141
- Whoa.
- Oh!

1216
01:00:43,208 --> 01:00:45,443
Oh, no. Oh, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no. No, no, no.

1217
01:00:45,510 --> 01:00:47,445
This can't be happening.
Come on, Thaddeus, stand up.

1218
01:00:47,512 --> 01:00:48,847
We're gonna go now.

1219
01:00:48,913 --> 01:00:50,382
We need to get you help.

1220
01:00:51,248 --> 01:00:52,884
Please, stand up.

1221
01:00:54,085 --> 01:00:56,722
You have to stop
Veronika Vanderberg.

1222
01:00:56,788 --> 01:00:59,623
No, we can't do it
without you, Thaddeus.

1223
01:01:01,425 --> 01:01:02,728
You don't need me.

1224
01:01:04,730 --> 01:01:06,264
But you do need each other.

1225
01:01:08,432 --> 01:01:09,735
Never forget that.

1226
01:01:14,039 --> 01:01:16,307
I knew when I came here,
this was...

1227
01:01:17,909 --> 01:01:21,512
probably my final trick.

1228
01:01:24,750 --> 01:01:28,320
Now, don't let me die in vain.

1229
01:01:31,389 --> 01:01:32,523
There's work to be done.

1230
01:01:37,929 --> 01:01:41,199
Go. Go now, go. Please.

1231
01:01:42,768 --> 01:01:43,768
Before it's...

1232
01:01:45,269 --> 01:01:47,137
too late.

1233
01:02:02,519 --> 01:02:03,954
Let's go. We gotta go.

1234
01:02:08,492 --> 01:02:09,561
Atlas!

1235
01:02:36,822 --> 01:02:38,623
The police
took June into custody.

1236
01:02:38,690 --> 01:02:40,425
Well, what about
Jack and Merritt?

1237
01:02:40,492 --> 01:02:42,460
- Them, too.
- Okay, so we break them out.

1238
01:02:42,527 --> 01:02:43,961
Whoa, uh-uh. Let's just talk
about this for a second.

1239
01:02:44,027 --> 01:02:45,063
Talk about what?

1240
01:02:45,130 --> 01:02:46,264
Listen to me.
We need to be smart.

1241
01:02:46,331 --> 01:02:48,065
No. We gotta get
my friend out of jail.

1242
01:02:48,132 --> 01:02:49,900
- Bosco... - Look, when you were
researching all that stuff

1243
01:02:49,967 --> 01:02:51,704
about us, you know
what didn't come up?

1244
01:02:53,204 --> 01:02:54,405
Charlie and June
are my only friends.

1245
01:02:55,572 --> 01:02:56,974
You know what
I really love about them?

1246
01:02:57,041 --> 01:02:58,844
They don't make me
feel like an asshole.

1247
01:02:58,909 --> 01:03:00,110
- I'm getting June.
- Bosco, wait...

1248
01:03:00,177 --> 01:03:01,679
- Listen to me. Hey.
- Just one second, dude.

1249
01:03:01,746 --> 01:03:02,782
Listen to me.
You can't.

1250
01:03:02,847 --> 01:03:03,849
Why? Tell me.

1251
01:03:03,914 --> 01:03:05,516
They're looking for you, Bosco.

1252
01:03:05,583 --> 01:03:06,951
They're looking for all of us.

1253
01:03:07,018 --> 01:03:09,086
- Yes. Yes, you're gonna
get arrested, too. - Yes.

1254
01:03:09,153 --> 01:03:10,655
- Shit.
- Exactly.

1255
01:03:10,722 --> 01:03:11,824
If only there was somebody else

1256
01:03:11,891 --> 01:03:13,123
crazy enough
to stage a jailbreak

1257
01:03:13,190 --> 01:03:15,592
with no resources,
no protection.

1258
01:03:15,661 --> 01:03:16,896
- Atlas.
- Yeah?

1259
01:03:18,496 --> 01:03:20,097
Maybe there is.

1260
01:03:37,382 --> 01:03:41,652
Thaddeus Marcus Bradley,
in case you're interested

1261
01:03:41,719 --> 01:03:44,722
in the name of the man
you just murdered.

1262
01:03:45,690 --> 01:03:47,492
Ah, yes,

1263
01:03:48,726 --> 01:03:49,994
that was unfortunate.

1264
01:03:51,528 --> 01:03:53,798
You know, when this
whole thing started,

1265
01:03:53,865 --> 01:03:57,534
I didn't give a shit about you
or your diamond,

1266
01:03:57,601 --> 01:04:03,708
but you just went
and made it deeply personal.

1267
01:04:03,775 --> 01:04:08,480
And now, I am really looking
forward to taking you down.

1268
01:04:08,545 --> 01:04:11,483
My father would have loved you.

1269
01:04:11,548 --> 01:04:13,351
He was quite fond of magic.

1270
01:04:13,418 --> 01:04:14,920
When I was five or six,

1271
01:04:14,985 --> 01:04:17,454
in one of the few moments
that I had him to myself,

1272
01:04:18,422 --> 01:04:19,925
he taught me a trick.

1273
01:04:19,990 --> 01:04:22,527
He would make a red silk
handkerchief disappear

1274
01:04:22,594 --> 01:04:24,262
and then come back
out of his mouth.

1275
01:04:24,329 --> 01:04:26,197
I loved it!

1276
01:04:26,264 --> 01:04:28,766
It had just
the right amount of flair.

1277
01:04:28,833 --> 01:04:31,871
And I practiced
that trick for months.

1278
01:04:31,936 --> 01:04:34,438
I thought that
if I could do it just right,

1279
01:04:34,505 --> 01:04:36,039
I would earn more of...

1280
01:04:37,675 --> 01:04:38,844
of him.

1281
01:04:39,911 --> 01:04:42,213
But that was the illusion.

1282
01:04:42,280 --> 01:04:44,516
I've hated magic ever since.

1283
01:04:44,581 --> 01:04:47,418
The camp, the cheese,
not to say anything

1284
01:04:47,485 --> 01:04:50,889
of con artists like you
with your mentalism.

1285
01:04:53,358 --> 01:04:57,061
Neither one of us has
psychic powers, Mr. McKinney.

1286
01:04:57,128 --> 01:05:00,297
But you don't have to.
You know where my Heart is.

1287
01:05:00,364 --> 01:05:01,967
And I don't have to,

1288
01:05:02,032 --> 01:05:03,501
because you're going to tell me.

1289
01:05:05,003 --> 01:05:07,137
I think you're smart enough
to know that

1290
01:05:07,204 --> 01:05:10,574
I ain't telling you shit,
as we say in Texas.

1291
01:05:10,641 --> 01:05:12,945
And, you're wrong
about mentalism.

1292
01:05:13,012 --> 01:05:17,882
People wear their entire
life story on their face.

1293
01:05:17,949 --> 01:05:20,385
You just have to know
how to read it.

1294
01:05:20,451 --> 01:05:22,253
Take yours, for example.

1295
01:05:23,454 --> 01:05:25,824
- May I?
- With pleasure.

1296
01:05:27,391 --> 01:05:28,927
This is gonna be fun.

1297
01:05:28,994 --> 01:05:32,130
Well, you've already shared,

1298
01:05:32,195 --> 01:05:35,768
in excruciating detail,
your daddy issues,

1299
01:05:35,833 --> 01:05:38,903
but I'm curious about your mom.

1300
01:05:40,039 --> 01:05:43,407
Why did she commit suicide?

1301
01:05:44,809 --> 01:05:47,012
Was she as desperate

1302
01:05:47,077 --> 01:05:50,213
for your father's attention
as you were?

1303
01:05:51,916 --> 01:05:53,184
Ooh...

1304
01:05:53,251 --> 01:05:54,284
She was.

1305
01:05:54,351 --> 01:05:56,989
And why was that?

1306
01:05:57,056 --> 01:06:00,625
Did your father give his
attention to someone else?

1307
01:06:03,161 --> 01:06:06,297
When you tuck your hair
behind your ear, that's a tell.

1308
01:06:07,532 --> 01:06:09,434
He was.

1309
01:06:09,500 --> 01:06:13,503
So, was he
banging his secretary?

1310
01:06:13,570 --> 01:06:16,139
No, that's too cliche.

1311
01:06:16,206 --> 01:06:19,543
But it had to be someone close
to your mom for her to...

1312
01:06:20,945 --> 01:06:23,782
A good friend?
Hairdresser?

1313
01:06:26,184 --> 01:06:28,119
It wasn't the housekeeper,
was it?

1314
01:06:29,387 --> 01:06:32,222
No, not the housekeeper.

1315
01:06:32,289 --> 01:06:34,358
I don't have time for this.

1316
01:06:34,425 --> 01:06:37,161
And that's what people usually
say when I'm getting hot.

1317
01:06:37,228 --> 01:06:40,297
Should we crank up the AC,
maybe open a window?

1318
01:06:40,364 --> 01:06:45,670
Now, if my dad was having sex
with my housekeeper

1319
01:06:45,737 --> 01:06:48,840
and my mom found out
and committed suicide,

1320
01:06:48,907 --> 01:06:54,545
I probably wouldn't cut the brakes
on my housekeeper's car.

1321
01:06:54,612 --> 01:06:58,615
But then again,
I'm not a psychopath.

1322
01:07:00,119 --> 01:07:02,954
You are a sad and pathetic man.

1323
01:07:04,056 --> 01:07:05,791
I can see
why you want to end it.

1324
01:07:07,291 --> 01:07:09,862
Uh, hey, uh, Veronika...

1325
01:07:09,927 --> 01:07:10,996
You know,

1326
01:07:11,063 --> 01:07:13,965
walking away is also a tell.

1327
01:07:40,826 --> 01:07:41,827
Ooh-la-la.

1328
01:07:54,940 --> 01:07:57,076
<i>Monsieur, monsieur, monsieur.</i>

1329
01:08:46,925 --> 01:08:48,259
Where is she?
Where's the girl?

1330
01:08:48,326 --> 01:08:50,427
Shit!

1331
01:08:50,494 --> 01:08:51,628
She escaped.

1332
01:09:02,940 --> 01:09:04,109
<i>Bonsoir.</i>

1333
01:09:11,615 --> 01:09:14,484
That's pretty disgusting,
even for you.

1334
01:09:17,454 --> 01:09:20,091
I think I may have
overdone it on the wine.

1335
01:09:20,625 --> 01:09:22,194
Hi, Lula.

1336
01:09:22,261 --> 01:09:23,426
You look great, by the way.

1337
01:09:24,061 --> 01:09:25,764
Okay, one...

1338
01:09:27,231 --> 01:09:28,833
I didn't think
I'd ever see you again.

1339
01:09:28,900 --> 01:09:29,902
How did you find us?

1340
01:09:31,103 --> 01:09:33,371
A little birdie told me.

1341
01:09:33,436 --> 01:09:35,539
Imagine my surprise.

1342
01:09:35,605 --> 01:09:38,143
You guys all got
back together without me.

1343
01:09:38,210 --> 01:09:40,478
What? No, it's not like that.
You don't understand.

1344
01:09:40,545 --> 01:09:41,979
It wasn't? No?

1345
01:09:42,046 --> 01:09:43,314
You're free. Dick.

1346
01:09:47,286 --> 01:09:49,154
The cavalry.

1347
01:09:50,922 --> 01:09:52,858
- Miss me?
- Oh, a lot.

1348
01:09:52,925 --> 01:09:54,827
Oh, hello there.
It's me, Lula...

1349
01:09:56,127 --> 01:09:57,360
Teeth! Lula!

1350
01:09:57,427 --> 01:09:59,096
Remember?
I too was once a Horseman.

1351
01:09:59,163 --> 01:10:01,532
Yeah, I asked about you.
I was the only one.

1352
01:10:01,599 --> 01:10:04,269
Oh, you were the...
He was the only one. Really?

1353
01:10:09,506 --> 01:10:11,275
Shit. Okay.

1354
01:10:15,079 --> 01:10:17,048
We have to get to the meet up.
Okay, here's the plan.

1355
01:10:17,114 --> 01:10:18,917
I have the getaway car.
It's all ready to go.

1356
01:10:18,984 --> 01:10:20,384
I just need Jack to hotwire it.

1357
01:10:20,451 --> 01:10:22,054
Wait, your plan is
for me to steal a car?

1358
01:10:22,119 --> 01:10:23,255
Uh-huh!

1359
01:10:23,322 --> 01:10:25,023
Okay, I'll hotwire the car.
You get June.

1360
01:10:25,090 --> 01:10:26,190
Do not leave without her,
all right?

1361
01:10:26,257 --> 01:10:27,926
- Meet us outside.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay.

1362
01:10:27,993 --> 01:10:30,528
Oh! Uh, watch for
flashing lights!

1363
01:10:30,595 --> 01:10:31,595
Okay.

1364
01:10:31,662 --> 01:10:32,797
You know, I can hotwire the...

1365
01:10:56,487 --> 01:10:58,724
- You can let go of me now.
- Right. Sorry.

1366
01:11:25,716 --> 01:11:27,051
Whoa!

1367
01:11:30,621 --> 01:11:32,056
<i>♪ Viva la France ♪</i>

1368
01:11:32,123 --> 01:11:33,490
<i>♪ I love the fries
and the toast ♪</i>

1369
01:11:42,701 --> 01:11:43,868
Come here.

1370
01:11:43,935 --> 01:11:45,770
Where is the diamond?

1371
01:11:45,837 --> 01:11:48,273
Merritt, thank you.

1372
01:11:48,340 --> 01:11:50,207
Got your back, kiddo.

1373
01:11:51,409 --> 01:11:52,542
But who's got yours?

1374
01:11:53,744 --> 01:11:54,746
Flashing lights.

1375
01:11:56,414 --> 01:11:57,448
Run!

1376
01:12:02,787 --> 01:12:03,822
Look into my eyes,

1377
01:12:03,889 --> 01:12:05,488
watch and wonder
why I whisper words

1378
01:12:05,555 --> 01:12:08,126
that weaken your will,
and sleep.

1379
01:12:12,096 --> 01:12:13,530
Not everyone's susceptible.

1380
01:12:18,770 --> 01:12:21,305
I said, "Sleep!"

1381
01:12:31,882 --> 01:12:33,484
Easy does it <i>s'il vous plait.</i>

1382
01:12:36,587 --> 01:12:37,587
Ta-da!

1383
01:12:51,770 --> 01:12:52,770
Hello?

1384
01:12:53,636 --> 01:12:55,073
Jack?

1385
01:12:55,140 --> 01:12:57,074
You could have told us
you were coming in a police car.

1386
01:12:57,141 --> 01:12:58,609
Thank you very much.

1387
01:12:58,676 --> 01:13:00,444
And, look, we made
the Fifth Horseman reappear.

1388
01:13:00,511 --> 01:13:02,046
- Hello, Lula.
- Hi.

1389
01:13:02,113 --> 01:13:03,948
Okay.

1390
01:13:04,015 --> 01:13:06,184
- Are you okay?
- Yeah. No, I'm okay. I'm okay.

1391
01:13:07,319 --> 01:13:09,552
- But they have Merritt.
- Shit.

1392
01:13:09,619 --> 01:13:11,622
- Yeah, I escaped, he couldn't.
- Yeah, yeah.

1393
01:13:11,689 --> 01:13:13,524
Very emotional time
for everybody here.

1394
01:13:13,591 --> 01:13:15,027
Clearly a lot going on.

1395
01:13:15,092 --> 01:13:18,363
And I'm really trying not to
take any of this personally.

1396
01:13:18,430 --> 01:13:20,265
But, please, can you tell me,

1397
01:13:20,332 --> 01:13:23,100
did The Eye
contact you directly?

1398
01:13:23,167 --> 01:13:24,435
- Yeah.
- You, too?

1399
01:13:24,502 --> 01:13:26,438
- Yes.
- Well, why didn't you call me sooner?

1400
01:13:26,505 --> 01:13:28,472
- I'm so sorry. I had to find a babysitter.
- Come on!

1401
01:13:28,538 --> 01:13:29,774
Everything happened like that.

1402
01:13:29,841 --> 01:13:31,810
Wait, sorry.
You two know each other?

1403
01:13:31,877 --> 01:13:32,877
- Yeah.
- Yeah, we know...

1404
01:13:32,944 --> 01:13:34,112
How many female magicians
do you think

1405
01:13:34,179 --> 01:13:35,780
- there are in the world?
- I mean, the fact

1406
01:13:35,846 --> 01:13:37,248
that there are three of us
in the room right now...

1407
01:13:37,314 --> 01:13:39,117
- Shocking. Shocking.
- ...it's, like, mind blown.

1408
01:13:39,184 --> 01:13:41,551
- That's true. - I'm surprised the universe
isn't folding in on itself.

1409
01:13:41,618 --> 01:13:43,020
- Exactly.
- Abu Dhabi!

1410
01:13:44,322 --> 01:13:46,091
- Does he just do that?
- Mm-hmm.

1411
01:13:46,158 --> 01:13:48,393
Sorry, I just... I'm a big fan of yours,
by the way.

1412
01:13:48,460 --> 01:13:51,095
I was trying to figure out
where Veronika was gonna be next.

1413
01:13:51,162 --> 01:13:55,599
And, apparently, Vanderberg Global
has a motorsports team.

1414
01:13:55,667 --> 01:13:59,569
They're introducing a new car
this weekend in Abu Dhabi.

1415
01:13:59,636 --> 01:14:01,773
- So we can get Merritt back
and expose her. - Yeah. Yeah.

1416
01:14:01,840 --> 01:14:02,940
No, no, no.
I am not exposing her.

1417
01:14:03,007 --> 01:14:04,475
I am not exposing anyone, okay?

1418
01:14:04,542 --> 01:14:06,144
I don't care
what The Eye wants. No.

1419
01:14:06,211 --> 01:14:07,979
We are swapping this for
Merritt, and then we are done.

1420
01:14:08,046 --> 01:14:09,448
We're saving our friend,
we're not saving the world.

1421
01:14:09,514 --> 01:14:10,815
- And then what?
- What?

1422
01:14:10,881 --> 01:14:12,350
We just go back to our lives
and let her walk away?

1423
01:14:12,417 --> 01:14:14,453
After Russia, you said,
"Magicians are entertainers,

1424
01:14:14,519 --> 01:14:15,921
- "not superheroes."
- Oh, my God. Here we go.

1425
01:14:15,987 --> 01:14:17,288
And I'm starting to think
that you were right.

1426
01:14:17,354 --> 01:14:19,024
She doesn't just launder money
like her father.

1427
01:14:19,091 --> 01:14:20,826
You saw
what happened to Thaddeus.

1428
01:14:20,891 --> 01:14:23,161
Obviously, I'm playing
a bit of catch up here, right?

1429
01:14:23,228 --> 01:14:24,627
I don't have
all of the information,

1430
01:14:24,695 --> 01:14:26,832
but I don't think that
that should stop me

1431
01:14:26,898 --> 01:14:28,667
from having an opinion
about what we do next.

1432
01:14:28,733 --> 01:14:30,335
- Of course it should.
- Exactly.

1433
01:14:30,402 --> 01:14:32,970
No, it shouldn't, Atlas.
And I think we should expose Vanessa.

1434
01:14:33,037 --> 01:14:34,038
- Veronika.
- Veronika.

1435
01:14:34,105 --> 01:14:35,273
For murder and...

1436
01:14:35,340 --> 01:14:36,341
- What is the other thing?
- Money laundering.

1437
01:14:36,408 --> 01:14:37,442
And for money laundering.

1438
01:14:37,509 --> 01:14:39,176
For murder
and for money laundering.

1439
01:14:39,243 --> 01:14:40,311
- Yeah. Yeah.
- We should tie her up...

1440
01:14:40,377 --> 01:14:42,546
No, no!
No, it is too dangerous!

1441
01:14:42,613 --> 01:14:43,948
- And Atlas is right.
- What?

1442
01:14:44,015 --> 01:14:45,117
We are done
sacrificing ourselves.

1443
01:14:45,182 --> 01:14:46,184
- Yeah.
- I'm sorry. It's not worth it.

1444
01:14:46,251 --> 01:14:47,551
That's bullshit!

1445
01:14:47,618 --> 01:14:48,987
- What?
- You're wrong.

1446
01:14:49,054 --> 01:14:51,021
- Am I?
- Sorry.

1447
01:14:51,088 --> 01:14:52,923
No. Don't be sorry.
Say it.

1448
01:14:54,225 --> 01:14:56,161
You are.
You're wrong. It's just...

1449
01:14:57,962 --> 01:15:00,631
Before I discovered
the Horsemen,

1450
01:15:00,698 --> 01:15:02,167
I didn't give a shit
about anything.

1451
01:15:02,234 --> 01:15:04,168
I... My family gave me up.

1452
01:15:05,203 --> 01:15:06,438
I hated the whole world.

1453
01:15:07,939 --> 01:15:11,376
And then,
I saw a video of you guys,

1454
01:15:11,443 --> 01:15:14,011
and you were trying
to make the world

1455
01:15:14,078 --> 01:15:18,250
less corrupt, less terrible.

1456
01:15:19,649 --> 01:15:23,587
And that made me give a shit.

1457
01:15:30,895 --> 01:15:31,997
So what's the trick?

1458
01:15:35,900 --> 01:15:37,435
I promise this is gonna work.

1459
01:15:37,502 --> 01:15:39,069
But is that enough misdirection?

1460
01:15:39,136 --> 01:15:42,340
As long as
she's here and not there.

1461
01:15:42,407 --> 01:15:43,608
We can take care of that.

1462
01:15:43,675 --> 01:15:45,543
If you're even
just five minutes late...

1463
01:15:45,609 --> 01:15:47,712
- Five? I'd say one.
- One minute late.

1464
01:15:47,779 --> 01:15:49,780
How do we know enough people
are gonna show up?

1465
01:15:49,847 --> 01:15:51,515
You guys, it's already viral.

1466
01:15:51,582 --> 01:15:53,451
I guarantee there'll be a crowd.

1467
01:15:53,518 --> 01:15:55,252
This is nuts.
There's too many variables.

1468
01:15:55,319 --> 01:15:57,354
Hey, we'll be in constant contact
with you if something goes awry...

1469
01:15:57,421 --> 01:15:59,957
Hey, hey, hey, there's, like,
no margin for error here, man.

1470
01:16:00,024 --> 01:16:01,225
Okay? Zero.

1471
01:16:01,292 --> 01:16:02,927
We're going to have to be
absolutely flawless

1472
01:16:02,993 --> 01:16:04,462
if we're gonna
pull something this risky off

1473
01:16:04,529 --> 01:16:05,963
with this many moving parts

1474
01:16:06,030 --> 01:16:07,431
in this ridiculously
short amount of time.

1475
01:16:07,498 --> 01:16:08,699
- Okay?
- Yes.

1476
01:16:08,766 --> 01:16:11,469
- Yeah.
- But speaking for myself, at least,

1477
01:16:11,536 --> 01:16:13,704
I think the seven of us have
a better chance than most.

1478
01:16:13,771 --> 01:16:15,207
Oh.

1479
01:16:15,273 --> 01:16:16,975
Would you look at this.

1480
01:16:17,042 --> 01:16:19,476
When did the great
Bosco Leroy go soft?

1481
01:16:20,712 --> 01:16:22,881
Okay, guys,
are we doing this or what?

1482
01:16:24,048 --> 01:16:26,083
It has
a ten million to one shot.

1483
01:16:26,885 --> 01:16:28,319
Those are my kind of odds.

1484
01:16:39,163 --> 01:16:42,634
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
the time has come.</i>

1485
01:16:42,702 --> 01:16:44,703
<i>Tonight, for one night only.</i>

1486
01:16:46,003 --> 01:16:49,106
<i>- Come in close.
- Closer.</i>

1487
01:16:49,173 --> 01:16:51,176
<i>Because the more
you think you see...</i>

1488
01:16:51,243 --> 01:16:53,578
<i>The easier it will be
to fool you.</i>

1489
01:16:53,645 --> 01:16:56,747
<i>The countdown
begins in only two hours.</i>

1490
01:16:56,814 --> 01:16:59,149
<i>The Four Horsemen
will be on stage together</i>

1491
01:16:59,216 --> 01:17:01,418
<i>for the first time in ten years.</i>

1492
01:17:02,386 --> 01:17:04,154
<i>J. Daniel Atlas.</i>

1493
01:17:09,394 --> 01:17:10,628
<i>Henley Reeves.</i>

1494
01:17:16,368 --> 01:17:17,534
<i>Jack Wilder.</i>

1495
01:17:22,742 --> 01:17:24,341
<i>And Lula May.</i>

1496
01:17:28,412 --> 01:17:31,882
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
the Four Horsemen.</i>

1497
01:17:31,949 --> 01:17:35,353
<i>That's right, the Horsemen
are back for one night only.</i>

1498
01:17:35,420 --> 01:17:37,722
<i>Now, last week,
we stole the Heart Diamond,</i>

1499
01:17:37,788 --> 01:17:40,225
<i>and tonight, in two hours' time,</i>

1500
01:17:40,292 --> 01:17:42,293
<i>we're going to return it
to its rightful owner,</i>

1501
01:17:42,894 --> 01:17:43,895
<i>all of you.</i>

1502
01:17:46,898 --> 01:17:48,166
Do you think
that got her attention?

1503
01:17:48,233 --> 01:17:49,533
If that didn't,
I don't know what will.

1504
01:17:49,600 --> 01:17:50,635
All right, listen,
now that you know

1505
01:17:50,703 --> 01:17:52,069
how bad things can actually get,

1506
01:17:52,136 --> 01:17:54,139
can you please just try
playing it safe this one time?

1507
01:17:56,073 --> 01:17:57,141
- No.
- Okay.

1508
01:17:57,207 --> 01:17:59,010
Oh.

1509
01:17:59,077 --> 01:18:00,845
Here she is.
Right on time.

1510
01:18:00,912 --> 01:18:02,514
You enjoying the show?

1511
01:18:02,579 --> 01:18:04,515
<i>Eh, it's a little tacky
for my taste.</i>

1512
01:18:04,582 --> 01:18:08,819
I assume you chose your venue
for its proximity to my own.

1513
01:18:08,886 --> 01:18:10,220
Well, good news for you.

1514
01:18:10,287 --> 01:18:13,224
I've placed you
on our guest list.

1515
01:18:13,291 --> 01:18:16,695
Bring me my Heart.
We'll make an exchange.

1516
01:18:16,761 --> 01:18:18,764
Mr. McKinney
for the diamond.

1517
01:18:18,829 --> 01:18:21,565
- Mm-hmm.
<i>- Outside, under the lights,</i>

1518
01:18:21,632 --> 01:18:24,435
and not the first hint of magic.

1519
01:18:24,502 --> 01:18:26,503
One rabbit comes out of a hat,

1520
01:18:26,570 --> 01:18:28,774
one ace slides out of a sleeve,

1521
01:18:28,840 --> 01:18:31,842
and your friend goes poof.

1522
01:18:33,211 --> 01:18:35,346
Just trying to use parlance
you'll understand.

Welcome to the W Yas Island.

1530
01:19:05,443 --> 01:19:07,145
The Orlando of the Middle East.

1531
01:19:07,212 --> 01:19:08,313
Ha.

1532
01:19:11,015 --> 01:19:14,452
Now, finally, thank you to Yas Island
for hosting an event

1533
01:19:14,519 --> 01:19:17,722
worthy of the fastest team
in motorsports.

1534
01:19:18,957 --> 01:19:20,792
This track is elite,

1535
01:19:20,859 --> 01:19:22,894
but it will soon provide
our competitors

1536
01:19:22,961 --> 01:19:25,663
with the most common view
in racing,

1537
01:19:25,730 --> 01:19:27,998
the rear wings of our cars.

1538
01:19:29,533 --> 01:19:31,002
Thank you.

1539
01:19:31,069 --> 01:19:33,738
- Thank you.
- Holy shit. That's Veronika?

1540
01:19:35,140 --> 01:19:38,076
She has a very
commanding presence.

1541
01:19:38,143 --> 01:19:40,145
Our magical friends
have arrived.

1542
01:19:40,211 --> 01:19:41,747
Why don't you go and greet them?

1543
01:19:41,814 --> 01:19:44,416
Thank you so much for coming.
I hope you enjoy the race.

1544
01:19:44,481 --> 01:19:46,819
Okay, Atlas said
to create a distraction.

1545
01:19:46,886 --> 01:19:48,118
How are we gonna pull this off?

1546
01:19:48,185 --> 01:19:49,854
There is security everywhere.

1547
01:19:50,921 --> 01:19:52,690
Okay, guys, calm down.
I got this.

1548
01:19:53,658 --> 01:19:55,092
Hello. Hi.

1549
01:19:55,159 --> 01:19:57,628
Uh, David. Cool.
I'm from media relations.

1550
01:19:57,695 --> 01:19:59,197
I was just checking in.

1551
01:19:59,264 --> 01:20:01,498
Do you think you guys could do
a different camera placement?

1552
01:20:01,565 --> 01:20:02,934
Okay, thanks. Continue.

1553
01:20:03,001 --> 01:20:03,967
Who is that?

1554
01:20:04,569 --> 01:20:05,569
Your turn.

1555
01:20:06,738 --> 01:20:07,739
Let's do this.

1556
01:20:08,707 --> 01:20:10,140
Make sure you confirm

1557
01:20:10,207 --> 01:20:11,844
the authenticity of the diamond.

1558
01:20:11,911 --> 01:20:13,978
These people are very tricky.

1559
01:20:15,246 --> 01:20:16,815
I'm so glad you came.

1560
01:20:16,881 --> 01:20:18,818
What do you say
we bury the hatchet?

1561
01:20:18,884 --> 01:20:20,984
- In each other's necks?
- Ha! He's funny.

1562
01:20:21,051 --> 01:20:24,288
We each possess something
beneficial to the other.

1563
01:20:24,354 --> 01:20:25,957
Perfect reason to do business.

1564
01:20:26,024 --> 01:20:27,391
Only, there's one caveat.

1565
01:20:27,458 --> 01:20:30,729
I fervently hope our mutual
dealings are at a close.

1566
01:20:30,796 --> 01:20:32,396
- She's so poised.
- Not now.

1567
01:20:32,463 --> 01:20:34,097
- I hate her... Ugh.
- Lula. Shh.

1568
01:20:35,265 --> 01:20:36,967
- How's it going?
- Bro, can I help you?

1569
01:20:37,034 --> 01:20:38,569
Yeah, we're here
to shoot the car.

1570
01:20:38,636 --> 01:20:40,872
- ID?
- Oh, right. Of course.

1571
01:20:40,939 --> 01:20:43,073
Obviously. There you are.

1572
01:20:43,140 --> 01:20:44,743
- And you?
- Uh, yeah,

1573
01:20:44,810 --> 01:20:46,109
it's in my jacket somewhere.

1574
01:20:48,847 --> 01:20:51,315
There it is.
We're with <i>Checkered Flags,</i> the doc series.

1575
01:20:51,381 --> 01:20:52,717
Next season's on
Vanderberg Motorsports.

1576
01:20:52,784 --> 01:20:54,385
They seriously didn't
give you guys a heads-up?

1577
01:20:54,452 --> 01:20:56,020
Typical.

1578
01:20:56,087 --> 01:20:58,489
We're just gonna get some
inserts, maybe some B-roll

1579
01:20:58,555 --> 01:21:01,326
and some party people
gawking at this beauty.

1580
01:21:01,391 --> 01:21:02,993
- All right, whenever you're...
- Oi, don't touch the car.

1581
01:21:03,060 --> 01:21:04,561
- We got to shoot the interior.
- Yeah.

1582
01:21:04,628 --> 01:21:06,264
I can actually get you
a cameo in this thing.

1583
01:21:06,331 --> 01:21:09,434
- Save it. I've got my orders.
- Yeah, and so do we.

1584
01:21:10,467 --> 01:21:11,936
Good evening,
Ms. Vanderberg.

1585
01:21:12,002 --> 01:21:14,605
Yeah. We're trying to get
that footage you asked for,

1586
01:21:14,672 --> 01:21:17,007
but we ran into
a little bit of a problem.

1587
01:21:17,074 --> 01:21:19,143
- You're gonna be in trouble.
- She wants to talk to you.

1588
01:21:19,210 --> 01:21:22,012
That's not good, my guy.
Mm-mm. Not good.

1589
01:21:22,914 --> 01:21:24,381
Hello.

1590
01:21:24,448 --> 01:21:25,751
<i>Listen, my father always said</i>

1591
01:21:25,818 --> 01:21:28,753
<i>no one buys
a diamond sight unseen.</i>

1592
01:21:28,820 --> 01:21:32,189
<i>And at this very moment,
my car is the diamond.</i>

1593
01:21:32,256 --> 01:21:34,726
So, you can
either let them do their job,

1594
01:21:34,792 --> 01:21:37,261
or you can
find yourself a new one.

1595
01:21:37,328 --> 01:21:38,831
Sorry for the holdup, ma'am.

1596
01:21:42,033 --> 01:21:43,903
- You're good.
- You're the best.

1597
01:21:43,969 --> 01:21:45,738
If you could just back up
for me really quick?

1598
01:21:45,804 --> 01:21:47,538
Just for the light.
Thanks, man.

1599
01:21:51,275 --> 01:21:53,176
- Well, shall we get on with it?
- Please.

1600
01:21:55,345 --> 01:21:57,247
Oh. Of course, you have
a goon. Forgive me.

1601
01:21:59,685 --> 01:22:00,886
Ah, come on, you don't trust us?

1602
01:22:00,953 --> 01:22:02,820
After all we've been through?

1603
01:22:07,057 --> 01:22:08,961
Is there a problem?

1604
01:22:09,028 --> 01:22:10,127
Double check
if you're not certain.

1605
01:22:10,194 --> 01:22:12,564
- It's the Heart.
- Yes, of course it is.

1606
01:22:12,630 --> 01:22:14,033
Now, please,
can you get our friend?

1607
01:22:15,466 --> 01:22:16,902
Come on.

1608
01:22:21,538 --> 01:22:23,608
There he is. Okay.

1609
01:22:23,676 --> 01:22:25,275
- Ah!
- Hey.

1610
01:22:25,342 --> 01:22:26,578
Whew.

1611
01:22:26,644 --> 01:22:28,012
You okay?

1612
01:22:28,078 --> 01:22:29,847
Well, now that I know I'm
worth half a billion dollars.

1613
01:22:29,914 --> 01:22:31,515
I still think we got ripped off,
but it's good to see you.

1614
01:22:31,582 --> 01:22:33,350
Signed, sealed, delivered.

1615
01:22:33,417 --> 01:22:35,653
See, I'm a woman of my word.

1616
01:22:35,720 --> 01:22:38,023
Stick around if you want,
enjoy the party.

1617
01:22:39,356 --> 01:22:41,359
What in God's name?

1618
01:22:45,730 --> 01:22:46,998
Shit!

1619
01:22:47,065 --> 01:22:48,867
Come on, come on, how do you
make this thing go?

1620
01:22:48,934 --> 01:22:50,268
Look out!

1621
01:22:50,335 --> 01:22:52,337
I can't concentrate
with you yelling at me!

1622
01:22:52,403 --> 01:22:54,006
Don't let him get away!

1623
01:22:56,274 --> 01:22:57,274
Excuse me!

1624
01:22:59,610 --> 01:23:00,645
Call the police!

1625
01:23:00,712 --> 01:23:02,180
You enjoying the show?

1626
01:23:02,246 --> 01:23:04,750
You just gonna stand there gawking
or get my car back?

1627
01:23:07,217 --> 01:23:08,219
You did this.

1628
01:23:13,024 --> 01:23:14,359
Okay, here we go.

1629
01:23:16,060 --> 01:23:18,328
Okay, Atlas, you wanted a distraction,
you got a distraction.

1630
01:23:21,599 --> 01:23:23,134
Man, this thing is tail happy.

1631
01:23:29,942 --> 01:23:31,810
Oh, man, what the hell?

1632
01:23:31,877 --> 01:23:34,813
We fell through
a trapdoor or something.

1633
01:23:34,880 --> 01:23:36,015
Is everybody okay?

1634
01:23:36,081 --> 01:23:37,414
- Where are we?
- No.

1635
01:23:39,384 --> 01:23:41,586
When I woke up this morning,
there was only one thing

1636
01:23:41,653 --> 01:23:43,689
I wanted more than my diamond.

1637
01:23:43,756 --> 01:23:46,091
My Horsemen under lock and key.

1638
01:23:46,157 --> 01:23:48,393
And now that I have both,

1639
01:23:48,458 --> 01:23:51,663
I must admit, I'm feeling
a little bit spoiled.

1640
01:23:51,729 --> 01:23:53,731
While you were prepping
your little performance,

1641
01:23:53,798 --> 01:23:56,068
I curated a trick of my own.

1642
01:23:56,135 --> 01:23:58,936
Five Horsemen trapped,
no escape.

1643
01:23:59,003 --> 01:24:01,073
You five may be
national treasures,

1644
01:24:01,140 --> 01:24:03,240
but we have those here, too.

1645
01:24:03,306 --> 01:24:05,510
Only they're hard to find,

1646
01:24:05,576 --> 01:24:07,779
because they're buried in sand.

1647
01:24:11,582 --> 01:24:13,551
To the world,
it will appear you died

1648
01:24:13,618 --> 01:24:16,287
in a failed escape act.

1649
01:24:16,354 --> 01:24:19,556
Now, let's see some magic.

1650
01:24:22,027 --> 01:24:24,128
Fuck magic!
Somebody call for backup!

1651
01:24:24,194 --> 01:24:26,296
- Jack, call June.
- Anyone have service?

1652
01:24:26,363 --> 01:24:28,033
God, she must have scrambled
the cell signal.

1653
01:24:28,100 --> 01:24:29,300
She thought of everything!

1654
01:24:29,367 --> 01:24:31,036
Lula, whose side are you on?

1655
01:24:31,103 --> 01:24:33,304
I'm on our side, obviously,
but she also thought of everything.

1656
01:24:33,371 --> 01:24:34,806
Both things can be true
at one time.

1657
01:24:34,872 --> 01:24:36,875
The sand is getting higher.
The sand is getting bigger.

1658
01:24:36,942 --> 01:24:38,408
There's more sand
and it's getting larger.

1659
01:24:38,475 --> 01:24:40,478
Henley, Henley, uh,
first principle of escape.

1660
01:24:40,545 --> 01:24:42,613
Uh, how long
is it survivable? Right.

1661
01:24:42,680 --> 01:24:44,414
Right. Great. Judging from
the rate of the flow,

1662
01:24:44,481 --> 01:24:45,751
the volume of the box...

1663
01:24:45,818 --> 01:24:47,251
- Uh, yeah, we're screwed.
- Oh, amazing.

1664
01:24:47,318 --> 01:24:49,420
Okay, how about the second
principle of escape then?

1665
01:24:49,487 --> 01:24:50,922
Okay, so that's the box itself.

1666
01:24:50,988 --> 01:24:52,157
Is there a flaw?
Is there a weakness?

1667
01:24:52,222 --> 01:24:53,256
Is there a back door?

1668
01:24:53,323 --> 01:24:55,094
Everybody just needs to check!

1669
01:24:55,159 --> 01:24:56,293
This side's sealed.

1670
01:24:56,359 --> 01:24:58,261
Shit. No, it's sealed,
sealed, sealed.

1671
01:25:00,865 --> 01:25:02,100
Everything's sealed.

1672
01:25:06,636 --> 01:25:08,207
Any chance
there's a third principle?

1673
01:25:14,880 --> 01:25:17,115
I have what you're after.

1674
01:25:17,181 --> 01:25:18,416
<i>Perfect.</i>

1675
01:25:18,483 --> 01:25:20,350
<i>I will meet you
where the Heart resides.</i>

1676
01:25:21,753 --> 01:25:23,055
I can hardly wait.

1677
01:25:28,226 --> 01:25:29,594
Straight to the vault.

1678
01:25:32,197 --> 01:25:34,532
No, no, no, no! Yes!

1679
01:25:36,367 --> 01:25:38,636
Help me, Ricky Bobby!
Help me!

1680
01:25:43,274 --> 01:25:44,609
Is this really gonna
happen right now?

1681
01:25:44,676 --> 01:25:47,179
We're just gonna die here
in this box? Really?

1682
01:25:47,246 --> 01:25:50,515
It's funny. A week ago,
I wanted to die,

1683
01:25:50,581 --> 01:25:53,051
and then... then I get
my reason to live back,

1684
01:25:53,118 --> 01:25:55,286
and now,
we're actually gonna die.

1685
01:25:55,353 --> 01:25:57,387
How is that funny?

1686
01:25:57,454 --> 01:25:59,457
Well, I mean,
it was funnier in my head.

1687
01:25:59,524 --> 01:26:00,792
It's... You know,
it's peculiar funny.

1688
01:26:00,859 --> 01:26:02,627
No. Uh-uh. No.

1689
01:26:02,694 --> 01:26:04,162
We're out of options.

1690
01:26:04,229 --> 01:26:05,663
God, I never should have
been that horrible

1691
01:26:05,730 --> 01:26:09,167
about your website
and your costumes and the logo.

1692
01:26:09,234 --> 01:26:10,735
- Okay.
- It's not embarrassing

1693
01:26:10,802 --> 01:26:13,371
that the "I" in "Wilder"
is a little magic wand.

1694
01:26:13,436 --> 01:26:14,505
I got it.
That's... Thank you.

1695
01:26:14,572 --> 01:26:15,807
It's not. It's cute
and it's charming.

1696
01:26:15,873 --> 01:26:18,176
- That's enough.
- And I... I missed you.

1697
01:26:18,243 --> 01:26:20,945
Listen, I know I don't
always show it, but, um...

1698
01:26:21,012 --> 01:26:22,546
I really do think
the world of all of you.

1699
01:26:24,817 --> 01:26:27,318
I cannot believe
we're getting buried alive.

1700
01:26:27,385 --> 01:26:29,755
- I mean, it's like a Western.
- Wait, wait. Buried alive.

1701
01:26:29,822 --> 01:26:31,756
That's, like,
an old magic tradition.

1702
01:26:31,823 --> 01:26:33,192
Sorry, who do we know
who did that?

1703
01:26:33,257 --> 01:26:35,894
Bill Shirk nearly died
doing that. Remember?

1704
01:26:35,961 --> 01:26:39,430
He got into a Plexiglas coffin
and had it covered in sand.

1705
01:26:39,497 --> 01:26:41,733
But didn't the Plexiglas break?

1706
01:26:41,800 --> 01:26:43,234
- The sand got wet.
- The sand got wet.

1707
01:26:43,301 --> 01:26:45,671
I remember now.
It rained the night before.

1708
01:26:45,737 --> 01:26:47,939
Okay, wet sand is heavier
than dry. It broke the glass.

1709
01:26:48,006 --> 01:26:50,876
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
If we broke that pipe,

1710
01:26:50,943 --> 01:26:52,176
then it would wet the sand,

1711
01:26:52,243 --> 01:26:54,212
and then it'll...
it'll break the box, right?

1712
01:26:54,279 --> 01:26:56,280
If I could... If I could
wrap something around it,

1713
01:26:56,346 --> 01:26:57,448
I might be able
to get some leverage.

1714
01:26:57,515 --> 01:26:59,051
Okay.

1715
01:26:59,117 --> 01:27:00,219
Merritt, give me your belt.

1716
01:27:00,284 --> 01:27:01,418
Okay.

1717
01:27:01,484 --> 01:27:03,121
- Okay, you got it. You got it.
- Yep, yeah.

1718
01:27:03,188 --> 01:27:04,421
Good, good, good.

1719
01:27:04,488 --> 01:27:07,693
- Wrap it, wrap it.
- Come on, come on, come on.

1720
01:27:07,759 --> 01:27:09,393
- Yes! Yes!
- Yes, yes, yes.

1721
01:27:11,662 --> 01:27:13,097
Help me! Help me!
Pull me down!

1722
01:27:13,164 --> 01:27:15,432
- Okay, okay. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- It's made up of metal.

1723
01:27:21,206 --> 01:27:23,640
Nice, nice, nice, okay.

1724
01:27:26,144 --> 01:27:27,145
Pull over.

1725
01:27:27,212 --> 01:27:28,779
You have been surrounded.

1726
01:27:28,846 --> 01:27:30,082
I'd love to pull over,

1727
01:27:30,148 --> 01:27:32,382
but I'm finally getting
the hang of it.

1728
01:27:36,654 --> 01:27:38,756
I'm the
greatest driver in the world!

1729
01:27:52,337 --> 01:27:53,436
No, no, no, no.

1730
01:27:55,207 --> 01:27:56,942
Watch out!

1731
01:27:59,011 --> 01:28:00,712
Damn it!

1732
01:28:00,779 --> 01:28:02,180
Turn off the engine
and exit the vehicle.

1733
01:28:02,247 --> 01:28:04,115
We've got you surrounded.

1734
01:28:04,181 --> 01:28:05,751
Put your hands up
and don't move!

1735
01:28:05,817 --> 01:28:08,418
I'm sorry. Did I forget
to use my blinker?

1736
01:28:08,485 --> 01:28:09,552
You're under arrest.

1737
01:28:11,055 --> 01:28:14,025
Thank you, gentlemen.
Excellent work.

1738
01:28:14,091 --> 01:28:16,862
We've had a red notice
for one Bosco Leroy.

1739
01:28:16,929 --> 01:28:18,561
- Thank you.
- No problem.

1740
01:28:19,664 --> 01:28:21,465
Yep, Atlas is gonna kill me.

1741
01:28:23,201 --> 01:28:26,503
- Water's coming in too fast.
- And the glass won't break.

1742
01:28:26,569 --> 01:28:28,873
- All this for a diamond.
- We could use that now.

1743
01:28:28,940 --> 01:28:30,541
Nothing cuts glass
like a diamond.

1744
01:28:30,608 --> 01:28:33,845
Wait. Wait, Henley. Henley.

1745
01:28:33,912 --> 01:28:36,847
Yes! I can hold my breath
for eight minutes.

1746
01:28:36,914 --> 01:28:39,051
If anyone can get us
out of this, we can.

1747
01:29:01,739 --> 01:29:03,175
We're crossing into
the desert, ma'am.

1748
01:29:03,240 --> 01:29:04,909
The dust storm is getting worse.

1749
01:29:13,118 --> 01:29:14,585
What's he doing here?

1750
01:29:14,652 --> 01:29:17,520
Ms. Vanderberg's diamond that
you and your friends stole?

1751
01:29:35,172 --> 01:29:36,942
Lost something?

1752
01:29:54,926 --> 01:29:56,127
That was fun.

1753
01:30:03,634 --> 01:30:05,636
- It's working!
- It's working.

1754
01:30:05,703 --> 01:30:06,805
Everybody help!

1755
01:30:06,872 --> 01:30:08,907
- Everybody help!
- Let's do it! Come on!

1756
01:30:37,868 --> 01:30:39,070
Henley, way to go!

1757
01:30:39,136 --> 01:30:40,570
- Oh, my God!
- Nice job!

1758
01:30:40,637 --> 01:30:42,673
All right,
we got a show to catch.

1759
01:30:42,740 --> 01:30:44,641
I hope we're not too late.

1760
01:30:44,708 --> 01:30:45,777
- You all right?
- Yeah.

1761
01:31:02,194 --> 01:31:03,295
<i>Identity verified.</i>

1762
01:31:24,216 --> 01:31:25,449
You made it.

1763
01:31:27,185 --> 01:31:28,787
Do you have what I want?

1764
01:31:28,854 --> 01:31:31,222
If you have what I want.

1765
01:31:34,859 --> 01:31:35,961
Where's the evidence?

1766
01:31:43,467 --> 01:31:44,469
Right here.

1767
01:31:46,203 --> 01:31:47,238
I'm the evidence.

1768
01:31:47,305 --> 01:31:49,274
No.

1769
01:31:50,640 --> 01:31:53,411
Charlie, I... I don't...

1770
01:31:54,945 --> 01:31:55,947
You're dead.

1771
01:31:58,048 --> 01:31:59,184
Now you see me.

1772
01:32:03,421 --> 01:32:07,259
It's quite fascinating
the things people do

1773
01:32:07,324 --> 01:32:10,862
to make something or someone...

1774
01:32:12,296 --> 01:32:13,364
disappear.

1775
01:32:18,403 --> 01:32:19,371
Ah.

1776
01:32:27,112 --> 01:32:29,413
I taught you that trick.

1777
01:32:29,480 --> 01:32:31,315
Just like our father taught you.

1778
01:32:32,484 --> 01:32:34,418
And now,
after 15 years, you're...

1779
01:32:34,485 --> 01:32:35,787
you're trying to ruin me?

1780
01:32:35,854 --> 01:32:36,854
No.

1781
01:32:38,088 --> 01:32:39,890
All 15 years.

1782
01:32:41,661 --> 01:32:43,795
I didn't know
you'd be in that car.

1783
01:32:43,862 --> 01:32:46,631
But you must have been
relieved to hear I was.

1784
01:32:47,765 --> 01:32:49,734
When we hit the water,

1785
01:32:49,801 --> 01:32:52,871
I couldn't unbuckle
my seat belts.

1786
01:32:52,938 --> 01:32:55,573
Mom freed me
with her dying breath.

1787
01:32:56,807 --> 01:32:59,043
I had nothing but fondness
for you, Charlie.

1788
01:33:01,613 --> 01:33:03,948
Let me finally treat you
like a brother.

1789
01:33:04,015 --> 01:33:05,216
I am your brother!

1790
01:33:08,520 --> 01:33:10,521
Father's blood is in both of us,

1791
01:33:11,957 --> 01:33:15,092
though he'd never
acknowledge mine.

1792
01:33:15,859 --> 01:33:17,229
God knows Mother begged.

1793
01:33:17,295 --> 01:33:19,664
And the shame drove
my mother to her grave.

1794
01:33:19,730 --> 01:33:22,067
Then you sent mine to hers!

1795
01:33:24,703 --> 01:33:25,704
Fine.

1796
01:33:26,404 --> 01:33:27,404
You're right.

1797
01:33:30,507 --> 01:33:31,909
It should be yours.

1798
01:33:33,712 --> 01:33:34,713
Here.

1799
01:33:36,981 --> 01:33:37,948
Take it.

1800
01:34:05,210 --> 01:34:07,612
Bullet catch.

1801
01:34:07,680 --> 01:34:11,115
- That's impossible.
- No. Just magic.

1802
01:34:14,286 --> 01:34:15,487
Ah.

1803
01:34:16,020 --> 01:34:16,988
Hmm.

1804
01:34:26,197 --> 01:34:28,300
Hello, everyone.

1805
01:34:28,768 --> 01:34:30,735
Thank you.

1806
01:34:30,801 --> 01:34:32,738
All right, thank you.

1807
01:34:32,804 --> 01:34:34,572
Earlier tonight,
J. Daniel Atlas

1808
01:34:34,639 --> 01:34:36,676
promised to return
the Heart Diamond

1809
01:34:36,742 --> 01:34:37,876
to its rightful owner.

1810
01:34:39,577 --> 01:34:41,112
But before we do that,

1811
01:34:41,179 --> 01:34:43,247
some introductions are in order.

1812
01:34:43,314 --> 01:34:47,918
First, let's say hello
to the fierce force of nature,

1813
01:34:47,985 --> 01:34:50,889
the extraordinary June Rouclere!

1814
01:34:53,490 --> 01:34:54,993
Yeah, June!

1815
01:34:55,060 --> 01:34:57,362
Wow. Hello, everyone.
Thank you.

1816
01:34:58,663 --> 01:35:00,864
Thank you so much.
Thank you.

1817
01:35:00,931 --> 01:35:04,034
And give it up
for the indomitable

1818
01:35:04,101 --> 01:35:06,738
Bosco Leroy!

1819
01:35:07,905 --> 01:35:09,940
The pleasure is ours.

1820
01:35:10,007 --> 01:35:12,077
Hello, gorgeous.

1821
01:35:15,613 --> 01:35:18,182
And, of course,
we could not have done

1822
01:35:18,248 --> 01:35:19,752
any of this in the first place

1823
01:35:19,819 --> 01:35:23,421
without the help of the world's
greatest magicians.

1824
01:35:23,488 --> 01:35:24,588
The Four...

1825
01:35:24,657 --> 01:35:27,559
Sorry, make that Five Horsemen!

1826
01:35:40,805 --> 01:35:41,939
Thank you, everyone.

1827
01:35:42,006 --> 01:35:45,042
Wow. Uh...

1828
01:35:45,109 --> 01:35:47,045
You know,
we have entertained, well,

1829
01:35:47,112 --> 01:35:49,948
dazzled audiences
all over the world,

1830
01:35:50,014 --> 01:35:53,283
but we have never been
part of a trick like this.

1831
01:35:53,350 --> 01:35:55,052
And you may be asking yourself,

1832
01:35:55,119 --> 01:35:57,154
"How did they
pull this off?"

1833
01:35:57,221 --> 01:36:00,826
Okay, well, every magician
needs an assistant. Veronika?

1834
01:36:03,127 --> 01:36:04,595
You may think Veronika here,

1835
01:36:05,563 --> 01:36:07,931
as Peter Vanderberg's sole heir,

1836
01:36:07,998 --> 01:36:10,100
is the rightful owner
of this diamond.

1837
01:36:10,167 --> 01:36:12,302
But, here's the twist.

1838
01:36:12,369 --> 01:36:14,939
Peter didn't have one child.
He had two.

1839
01:36:15,006 --> 01:36:16,274
That's right.

1840
01:36:16,341 --> 01:36:18,909
And that other child
cheated death.

1841
01:36:18,976 --> 01:36:20,944
And landed in New York City.

1842
01:36:24,082 --> 01:36:26,719
<i>Where vengeance
became his life's work.</i>

1843
01:36:28,887 --> 01:36:31,122
<i>But he would need help.</i>

1844
01:36:31,189 --> 01:36:33,358
Oh. Found the scotch.
Thanks.

1845
01:36:34,225 --> 01:36:35,661
<i>So he recruited.</i>

1846
01:36:35,728 --> 01:36:36,761
...when to stop,
tell me when.

1847
01:36:36,828 --> 01:36:37,829
Stop.

1848
01:36:37,896 --> 01:36:38,962
- Is that your card?
- Yes.

1849
01:36:39,029 --> 01:36:40,666
Yeah? You want to know
how I did it?

1850
01:36:40,733 --> 01:36:41,801
<i>Enticed...</i>

1851
01:36:43,868 --> 01:36:46,203
<i>and lured some of the most</i>

1852
01:36:46,270 --> 01:36:48,038
<i>brilliant minds
he could assemble,</i>

1853
01:36:49,506 --> 01:36:53,043
<i>laying the groundwork
for a trick unlike any other.</i>

1854
01:36:55,246 --> 01:36:57,850
<i>Which brings us to tonight.</i>

1855
01:36:57,917 --> 01:37:01,152
Make some noise for the mastermind
behind all of this.

1856
01:37:01,219 --> 01:37:02,720
Our best friend.

1857
01:37:02,787 --> 01:37:05,724
- A ghost...
- Until this very moment.

1858
01:37:05,791 --> 01:37:07,693
Charlie Vanderberg!

1859
01:37:11,061 --> 01:37:12,898
- Wow.
- Whoo!

1860
01:37:16,266 --> 01:37:18,203
I know I said
I'd enjoy taking you down,

1861
01:37:18,269 --> 01:37:20,171
but this is more fun
than I anticipated.

1862
01:37:20,238 --> 01:37:22,875
You are still a sad
and pathetic man.

1863
01:37:22,942 --> 01:37:24,208
And you are nothing.

1864
01:37:24,274 --> 01:37:26,043
Oh, hold on, everyone.
One sec.

1865
01:37:26,109 --> 01:37:27,511
- And you never will be.
- What's that?

1866
01:37:27,578 --> 01:37:28,881
I don't understand
how you pulled this off.

1867
01:37:28,948 --> 01:37:30,047
You don't understand?

1868
01:37:30,113 --> 01:37:32,484
Veronika doesn't
seem to understand

1869
01:37:32,550 --> 01:37:34,485
how she found herself
in this position.

1870
01:37:34,551 --> 01:37:36,689
Well, let's explain it to her.

1871
01:37:36,755 --> 01:37:42,193
You see, the finest magic
preys on assumptions.

1872
01:37:42,260 --> 01:37:43,695
<i>That the car waiting for you</i>

1873
01:37:43,761 --> 01:37:45,395
<i>was the same one
that dropped you off.</i>

1874
01:37:45,462 --> 01:37:46,497
Let's go.

1875
01:37:50,234 --> 01:37:53,671
<i>That an act of
Mother Nature is nothing but.</i>

1876
01:38:05,315 --> 01:38:06,952
<i>And that a vault in the desert</i>

1877
01:38:07,018 --> 01:38:08,485
<i>isn't just smoke and mirrors.</i>

1878
01:38:13,490 --> 01:38:16,662
<i>That a gun
isn't filled with blanks.</i>

1879
01:38:17,762 --> 01:38:18,963
<i>And that an elevator</i>

1880
01:38:19,029 --> 01:38:22,199
<i>is just simply
descending into earth.</i>

1881
01:38:22,266 --> 01:38:25,537
If you want to trick
the master of deception,

1882
01:38:25,603 --> 01:38:27,872
you have to
manipulate her reality.

1883
01:38:28,841 --> 01:38:30,375
And for our last trick,

1884
01:38:30,440 --> 01:38:32,711
why don't we make
Veronika disappear?

1885
01:38:34,645 --> 01:38:35,646
No.

1886
01:38:36,180 --> 01:38:37,314
You don't win.

1887
01:38:37,381 --> 01:38:39,752
- I'm the Vanderberg family!
- There she is.

1888
01:38:39,818 --> 01:38:41,085
Miss you already.

1889
01:38:41,152 --> 01:38:43,087
- Final reveal!
- Do you hear me?

1890
01:38:43,154 --> 01:38:44,588
The real Veronika Vanderberg.

1891
01:38:44,657 --> 01:38:46,759
The Vanderbergs do not lose!

1892
01:38:46,824 --> 01:38:49,127
The world is full of illusions.

1893
01:38:49,193 --> 01:38:51,261
One of the biggest
is that this diamond

1894
01:38:51,328 --> 01:38:54,097
belongs to
the Vanderbergs at all.

1895
01:38:54,164 --> 01:38:57,670
As my father's only
un-incarcerated next of kin,

1896
01:38:57,735 --> 01:39:00,972
I'll make sure every one
of our illicit buyers

1897
01:39:01,039 --> 01:39:03,507
faces legal repercussions.

1898
01:39:03,574 --> 01:39:06,011
And then
I'll gift all our assets,

1899
01:39:06,077 --> 01:39:07,912
including the Heart

1900
01:39:07,979 --> 01:39:11,114
to the South African
communities they came from

1901
01:39:11,181 --> 01:39:14,152
with a few extra dollars
left for all of you.

1902
01:39:15,720 --> 01:39:18,957
Horsemen crowds always leave
with deeper pockets.

1903
01:39:19,024 --> 01:39:21,192
- Nice trick.
- I learn from the best.

1904
01:39:23,094 --> 01:39:24,095
Thank you.

1905
01:39:25,262 --> 01:39:27,131
Thank you.

1906
01:39:27,198 --> 01:39:29,868
Thank you for joining us,
all of us.

1907
01:39:31,168 --> 01:39:32,369
And please remember,

1908
01:39:32,436 --> 01:39:35,372
no matter what cards
life deals you,

1909
01:39:35,439 --> 01:39:38,609
you have to learn
to make your own magic.

1910
01:39:39,409 --> 01:39:40,645
Ladies and gentlemen...

1911
01:39:40,712 --> 01:39:43,347
We are the Horsemen.
Good night.

1912
01:40:19,449 --> 01:40:22,319

1914
01:40:25,256 --> 01:40:28,894
All right, what do you want,
pomegranate or boysenberry?

1915
01:40:28,961 --> 01:40:30,929
Dude, I said I wanted a drink.

1916
01:40:30,996 --> 01:40:32,596
Just give it a try.

1917
01:40:34,667 --> 01:40:36,367
Kids today.

1918
01:40:41,140 --> 01:40:42,506
- Mm!
- Of course.

1919
01:40:42,573 --> 01:40:44,175
That's pretty good.

1920
01:40:44,242 --> 01:40:45,443
- You wanna try?
- No.

1921
01:40:45,510 --> 01:40:46,779
I think you dropped this.

1922
01:40:47,779 --> 01:40:49,514
Oh. My old card.

1923
01:40:49,579 --> 01:40:50,581
Just in case you wanna frame it.

1924
01:40:50,648 --> 01:40:52,751
Thanks. I might.

1925
01:40:52,818 --> 01:40:55,087
You know, I still cannot
believe you're a Vanderberg.

1926
01:40:55,154 --> 01:40:56,520
Neither could she.

1927
01:40:56,587 --> 01:40:57,789
I was thinking I feel like

1928
01:40:57,855 --> 01:40:59,423
we should start
our own group, you guys.

1929
01:40:59,489 --> 01:41:01,025
- A girls magic group?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1930
01:41:01,092 --> 01:41:03,729
- Yes.
- The Hor... Horsegirls.

1931
01:41:03,796 --> 01:41:06,363
- No. Not that.
- Wait, Horsewomen.

1932
01:41:06,430 --> 01:41:07,699
- Not that.
- Ladies of the Horse.

1933
01:41:07,765 --> 01:41:08,900
- It wouldn't be that.
- Ponies!

1934
01:41:08,966 --> 01:41:09,967
- That's really bad.
- Yeah?

1935
01:41:10,034 --> 01:41:11,435
Can I talk to you real quick?

1936
01:41:11,502 --> 01:41:12,871
Ooh!

1937
01:41:12,938 --> 01:41:14,872
I'm not trying to infiltrate
the Horsewomen.

1938
01:41:14,939 --> 01:41:16,474
What... what's up?

1939
01:41:17,442 --> 01:41:18,643
Um...

1940
01:41:19,677 --> 01:41:21,279
- It's just...
- Speak.

1941
01:41:21,345 --> 01:41:22,447
What is the matter with you?
What's wrong?

1942
01:41:22,512 --> 01:41:24,917
It's hard because I don't...

1943
01:41:24,983 --> 01:41:26,250
I don't know how you feel.

1944
01:41:26,317 --> 01:41:27,318
So...

1945
01:41:27,385 --> 01:41:29,287
Hey, uh, everybody.

1946
01:41:29,353 --> 01:41:31,923
Everybody, come on
over here, please.

1947
01:41:31,989 --> 01:41:33,926
Yeah? Come on, guys.

1948
01:41:33,992 --> 01:41:37,729
Hey, can you grab some more of those
delicious things, Bosco?

1949
01:41:37,796 --> 01:41:41,565
You are gonna love this stuff.
It is slap.

1950
01:41:41,631 --> 01:41:43,634
- No, Merritt, please.
- It slaps.

1951
01:41:43,702 --> 01:41:45,136
What I meant to say is
it's good.

1952
01:41:45,203 --> 01:41:46,270
Yeah. Right.

1953
01:41:46,337 --> 01:41:48,506
Yes, and I will be
the one to say it.

1954
01:41:48,573 --> 01:41:50,007
I'm going to miss you guys.

1955
01:41:51,375 --> 01:41:52,677
I was just thinking
the same thing.

1956
01:41:52,744 --> 01:41:53,746
Yeah. Me, too.

1957
01:41:54,747 --> 01:41:56,279
Damn it, I love you guys.

1958
01:41:56,346 --> 01:41:57,815
- Aw.
- We love you, too.

1959
01:41:57,882 --> 01:41:59,717
We love you.

1960
01:42:00,719 --> 01:42:01,953
- Adorable.
- Me, too.

1961
01:42:02,020 --> 01:42:03,287
Very sweet.
Even me?

1962
01:42:03,354 --> 01:42:05,288
Really?
You must be very drunk.

1963
01:42:05,355 --> 01:42:06,692
Whoa.

1964
01:42:06,759 --> 01:42:07,792
My God.

1965
01:42:07,859 --> 01:42:09,027
Can we just talk
about something else?

1966
01:42:09,094 --> 01:42:10,863
Go back to what...

1967
01:42:10,929 --> 01:42:12,329
- we all love each other.
- I mean, come on, you love him, he loves her.

1968
01:42:12,395 --> 01:42:13,765
You guys love each other more.

1969
01:42:13,832 --> 01:42:15,100
Oh.

1970
01:42:15,167 --> 01:42:17,301
You guys expecting someone?

1971
01:42:17,368 --> 01:42:18,904
No one's supposed
to know where we are.

1972
01:42:36,621 --> 01:42:38,657
- Who's it from?
- Doesn't say.

1973
01:42:38,724 --> 01:42:40,057
Open it.

1974
01:42:40,125 --> 01:42:41,359
You open it.

1975
01:42:41,425 --> 01:42:42,426
Okay.

1976
01:42:49,600 --> 01:42:51,368
Oh, that's the... that's
the thing from the door.

1977
01:42:51,435 --> 01:42:52,837
- Yeah, from the chateau.
- Oh, yeah!

1978
01:42:52,904 --> 01:42:55,207
Do you, uh... You mind if
I take another crack at it?

1979
01:42:55,274 --> 01:42:56,640
- Yeah, yeah, go for it.
- Yeah?

1980
01:42:58,408 --> 01:43:01,479
I think I can handle it
this time.

1981
01:43:15,560 --> 01:43:16,828
Hello, Horsemen.

1982
01:43:17,962 --> 01:43:19,198
Did you miss me?

1983
01:43:19,264 --> 01:43:21,265
Dylan.

1984
01:43:21,332 --> 01:43:23,068
But he's supposed
to be in prison.

1985
01:43:23,135 --> 01:43:26,070
I know what you're thinking.
"He lied to us."

1986
01:43:26,137 --> 01:43:27,505
But I...
I didn't lie to you.

1987
01:43:27,572 --> 01:43:30,042
I just led you to believe
something that wasn't true.

1988
01:43:30,108 --> 01:43:33,078
But it was
for your own good, trust me.

1989
01:43:33,145 --> 01:43:35,247
There's more to this mystery
than you realize.

1990
01:43:35,314 --> 01:43:38,615
And the end result is that the Horsemen
are back together again.

1991
01:43:38,684 --> 01:43:39,818
It warms my heart.

1992
01:43:41,752 --> 01:43:43,822
Now, for you three imposters,

1993
01:43:45,090 --> 01:43:46,891
brazenly pretending like

1994
01:43:46,958 --> 01:43:49,261
you're part of our
top secret organization?

1995
01:43:49,328 --> 01:43:51,896
You think you're gonna
get away with it

1996
01:43:51,963 --> 01:43:54,733
with no consequences
or repercussions?

1997
01:43:55,632 --> 01:43:56,634
Well...

1998
01:43:57,368 --> 01:43:58,770
you thought right.

1999
01:43:58,837 --> 01:44:00,637
- Hey!
- Welcome.

2000
01:44:01,439 --> 01:44:02,841
Welcome to The Eye.

2001
01:44:04,877 --> 01:44:06,345
As for the rest of you,

2002
01:44:07,345 --> 01:44:09,479
you thought your work was done.

2003
01:44:10,948 --> 01:44:12,216
Think again, team.

2004
01:44:13,318 --> 01:44:15,153
You're just getting started.

2005
01:44:18,389 --> 01:44:20,158
