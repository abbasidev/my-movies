1
00:01:05,416 --> 00:01:07,249
Shots fired, shots fired!

2
00:01:07,250 --> 00:01:08,790
Repeat, we've got shots fired!

3
00:01:10,083 --> 00:01:13,040
Requesting backup.
We had shots fired.

4
00:01:13,041 --> 00:01:16,291
Jesus Christ. I think someone's
just jumped the Albanians. Go.

5
00:01:37,708 --> 00:01:39,665
Where is my backup?

6
00:01:43,958 --> 00:01:45,208
Oh! No, no, no, no, no!

7
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:08,082
Well, you know how it is.

8
00:02:10,375 --> 00:02:12,665
That swag, just how I like it.

9
00:02:16,833 --> 00:02:19,624
And I said, "Well, who? Me, or
the mugs who shorted the stock?"

10
00:02:19,625 --> 00:02:22,374
It's like please take
stock of how shit you are.

11
00:02:23,916 --> 00:02:26,666
Or like, uh...

12
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,415
stock, stoc... stock up

13
00:02:32,416 --> 00:02:37,165
on, um, knowledge
about the situation?

14
00:02:37,166 --> 00:02:39,791
Just don't make mistakes.

15
00:02:41,541 --> 00:02:44,749
So, hang on, what did you do when
they asked about day trading?

16
00:02:44,750 --> 00:02:47,207
Oh. I said, "Oh, hmm, fuck off."

17
00:02:49,333 --> 00:02:50,916
Hugh. Did you
update that server?

18
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,958
Oh. Hmm... fuck off?

19
00:03:01,833 --> 00:03:04,915
I mean, it wasn't sort of fuck
off in a sort of nasty way,

20
00:03:04,916 --> 00:03:06,249
just sort of fuck off joking.

21
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:09,040
Well, I can't say I quite
get the "joke" myself,

22
00:03:09,041 --> 00:03:12,874
and this isn't the first time we've
had to talk about your "soft skills."

23
00:03:12,875 --> 00:03:15,790
Look, Hugh. Keep
in your lane, hmm?

24
00:03:15,791 --> 00:03:19,041
Stay on top of the Wi-Fi and stop
trying to be part of the team.

25
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:21,832
Is your Wi-Fi okay?

26
00:03:21,833 --> 00:03:23,165
-It's fine.
-Okay.

27
00:03:23,166 --> 00:03:25,749
-State your name.
-Marlon Swift.

28
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:27,749
You had a chance
to see the script?

29
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:29,540
Would it be okay if I
went a bit off-piste?

30
00:03:29,541 --> 00:03:34,832
I always find improv helps me
find the truth of a character.

31
00:03:34,833 --> 00:03:36,250
Uh, yeah. Sure.

32
00:03:39,625 --> 00:03:44,374
It's not hard... it's
impossible, Jennifer.

33
00:03:44,375 --> 00:03:48,500
Impossible to be in a body that
won't give you what you want.

34
00:03:49,583 --> 00:03:54,041
No. Don't, Jennifer. Please.

35
00:03:56,250 --> 00:03:57,875
Don't you dare cry.

36
00:03:59,291 --> 00:04:01,332
Don't you do that, Jen.

37
00:04:01,333 --> 00:04:04,290
This isn't about you. I want
you so much, but my body...

38
00:04:04,291 --> 00:04:10,000
Sorry, I think... Marlon?
Maybe just one on... script?

39
00:04:15,708 --> 00:04:19,165
It's not hard... to stay hard

40
00:04:19,166 --> 00:04:21,916
with "Rocket Power For Men."

41
00:04:24,291 --> 00:04:26,457
I can't do this anymore,
Terry. I want proper work.

42
00:04:26,458 --> 00:04:28,040
Says the Pizza Knight.

43
00:04:28,041 --> 00:04:29,249
<i>I didn't spend three
years of drama school</i>

44
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:31,124
<i>-to end up selling frozen dinners.</i>
-Fuck sake.

45
00:04:31,125 --> 00:04:33,540
No more ads. Acting.
Authentic, gritty characters.

46
00:04:33,541 --> 00:04:36,290
I wanna plumb the depths
of the human condition.

47
00:04:36,291 --> 00:04:38,207
<i>We've been down
this road before.</i>

48
00:04:38,208 --> 00:04:42,207
Feedback's always the same, they don't buy
you as the intense guy who's seen horrors.

49
00:04:42,208 --> 00:04:44,082
I'm an actor, I can be anything.

50
00:04:44,083 --> 00:04:47,290
<i>You're from The Cotswolds,
you're not Al Pacino.</i>

51
00:04:47,291 --> 00:04:50,374
Look, I've got something that's much more
your wheelhouse: fresh in this morning,

52
00:04:50,375 --> 00:04:53,290
<i>-West End venue.</i>
-West End. Okay.

53
00:04:53,291 --> 00:04:55,332
Character is an elven messenger

54
00:04:55,333 --> 00:04:58,375
who directs kids to the
toy store of their dreams.

55
00:04:59,583 --> 00:05:02,457
-Is this standing about with a sign?
-In the West End.

56
00:05:02,458 --> 00:05:04,915
I really think you can
bring something to this.

57
00:05:04,916 --> 00:05:08,249
<i>Only thing is, they need someone
to commit for the whole season.</i>

58
00:05:28,916 --> 00:05:30,957
-Can I use your toilet?
-Sorry.

59
00:05:30,958 --> 00:05:32,665
Toilets are only for
paying customers.

60
00:05:32,666 --> 00:05:34,915
-Please. I'm desperate.
-I'm afraid it's a strict rule.

61
00:05:34,916 --> 00:05:36,082
You'll have to get something.

62
00:05:36,083 --> 00:05:37,124
Oh, fine, fine.

63
00:05:37,125 --> 00:05:41,207
Uh, just do me a Celtic
symbol. But be quick.

64
00:05:45,166 --> 00:05:47,165
Nice! Great escalation.

65
00:05:47,166 --> 00:05:50,749
See that was funny because they
weren't trying to be funny.

66
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:53,415
They just committed to their
characters and rolled with it.

67
00:05:53,416 --> 00:05:56,000
-Um, yup. Trish and Dave, you're up.
-Oh.

68
00:05:59,791 --> 00:06:03,875
Okay, okay. Scene title:
"Customer Service."

69
00:06:05,625 --> 00:06:06,915
How can I help you, sir?

70
00:06:06,916 --> 00:06:08,332
I've got a rash.

71
00:06:08,333 --> 00:06:12,040
-Oh. Well, lucky for you, I'm a doctor.
-No, you're not. You're a plumber.

72
00:06:12,041 --> 00:06:14,249
A plum... No.

73
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:17,165
-No, I'm a doctor. I do doctoring...
-Oh, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.

74
00:06:17,166 --> 00:06:18,499
Dave, Dave, Dave, Dave.

75
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:22,457
If she says she's a doctor,
she's a doctor. Right?

76
00:06:22,458 --> 00:06:27,082
"Yes, and"? "Yes, and" always
"yes, and," and then build on it.

77
00:06:27,083 --> 00:06:28,999
Never hang your
partner out to dry.

78
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,874
See, improv is all about
being in the moment,

79
00:06:32,875 --> 00:06:36,290
even if the moment
is completely insane.

80
00:06:36,291 --> 00:06:41,207
Because when you're on that
stage, there are no mistakes...

81
00:06:41,208 --> 00:06:43,749
Only opportunity.

82
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:45,415
Sorry, I'm so sorry.

83
00:06:45,416 --> 00:06:48,165
No, it's okay. Are you here
for class? Oh, that's great.

84
00:06:48,166 --> 00:06:50,708
Let's get you to
jump in with Marlon.

85
00:06:52,291 --> 00:06:53,291
Marlon?

86
00:06:54,375 --> 00:06:58,332
I'm just working on my
character. Maybe a war veteran.

87
00:06:58,333 --> 00:07:01,624
Yeah, you don't know what the
scene is yet, Marlon. Come on.

88
00:07:01,625 --> 00:07:03,957
-Yeah. Come on.
-Okay. Um...

89
00:07:03,958 --> 00:07:05,457
Just trust your gut.

90
00:07:05,458 --> 00:07:09,790
-And when in doubt, "yes, and."
-"And."

91
00:07:09,791 --> 00:07:10,957
Yes.

92
00:07:10,958 --> 00:07:12,832
"And."

93
00:07:12,833 --> 00:07:15,207
Oh, I was just saying "yes,"

94
00:07:15,208 --> 00:07:18,665
but yes. And.

95
00:07:18,666 --> 00:07:20,665
Yeah. You can just wait
till the scene starts.

96
00:07:20,666 --> 00:07:23,875
Okay. Scene title:
"Bad Babysitter."

97
00:07:30,791 --> 00:07:32,790
Uh, sorry I'm late.

98
00:07:32,791 --> 00:07:36,165
I was just remembering
what happened over there.

99
00:07:36,166 --> 00:07:37,250
Carnage.

100
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,665
So where's my boy?

101
00:07:40,666 --> 00:07:41,999
Don't overthink it.

102
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,124
Uh, crikey...

103
00:07:43,125 --> 00:07:44,415
Where's little Timmy?

104
00:07:44,416 --> 00:07:48,499
-First thing that pops into your head.
-I... really have no clue.

105
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:50,040
You lost my son?

106
00:07:55,958 --> 00:07:57,290
Thanks, Kat.

107
00:07:57,291 --> 00:07:59,082
-See you next week.
-Mm-hmm.

108
00:07:59,083 --> 00:08:02,333
Hey, Kat. Did you get that
my war vet was anti-vax?

109
00:08:03,666 --> 00:08:05,290
Yeah.

110
00:08:05,291 --> 00:08:06,375
Good.

111
00:08:07,416 --> 00:08:10,291
Signed up to the rest
of the class, and...

112
00:08:13,625 --> 00:08:16,124
sorry, just trying to improvise
something around the word "class."

113
00:08:16,125 --> 00:08:17,332
I wouldn't force it.

114
00:08:17,333 --> 00:08:20,249
Right, right. Just
relax. Oh, my... Christ!

115
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:22,624
-I'm so sorry.
-Uh, no, it's fine. Leave it.

116
00:08:22,625 --> 00:08:24,124
-Are you sure? Okay. Thank you.
-Yeah, yeah, I got it, I got it.

117
00:08:24,125 --> 00:08:26,000
-No problem. I'll see you next week.
-Okay.

118
00:08:27,166 --> 00:08:29,874
Hey, Kat. Could we
have some advice?

119
00:08:29,875 --> 00:08:31,332
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Of course.

120
00:08:31,333 --> 00:08:33,749
'Cause we've got some agents
coming to the showcase next week.

121
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:37,832
What? Wow, that was fast.

122
00:08:37,833 --> 00:08:40,915
So, are there any
questions we should ask?

123
00:08:40,916 --> 00:08:44,290
Oh. Well, um, see,
you could ask,

124
00:08:44,291 --> 00:08:49,124
are they looking for a 39-year-old
redhead with an expiring work visa?

125
00:08:49,125 --> 00:08:50,874
No, no, no, no, no.

126
00:08:50,875 --> 00:08:55,999
I would ask how they're gonna
handle it when the auditions dry up.

127
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,749
When you've been hustling for
years and years and years,

128
00:08:58,750 --> 00:09:03,249
and you've got nothing to show
for it other than, uh, two lines

129
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:05,790
as "Sassy Barista"
in a shitty sitcom.

130
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:08,250
I mean, that's the
question, right?

131
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:12,833
Are they gonna stick around
when things get fucking dark?

132
00:09:17,333 --> 00:09:18,707
Thanks, Kat.

133
00:09:18,708 --> 00:09:20,791
Yeah. Anytime.

134
00:09:25,958 --> 00:09:27,499
What the fuck?!

135
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:30,707
I mean, obviously, life
is hell at the moment.

136
00:09:30,708 --> 00:09:34,207
Since Paul and I sold the company,
we're stuck having sex again.

137
00:09:34,208 --> 00:09:36,790
Hence this nightmare.

138
00:09:36,791 --> 00:09:38,665
As if having baby number
four wasn't enough,

139
00:09:38,666 --> 00:09:41,374
planning this one's hen-do
has been an absolute mindfuck.

140
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:42,915
God, nothing crazy,
guys, please.

141
00:09:42,916 --> 00:09:45,540
Oh, no, don't worry. Super
chill vibe, budget's 500 each.

142
00:09:45,541 --> 00:09:47,665
Each?

143
00:09:47,666 --> 00:09:50,124
Yeah, but that covers literally
everything except food and drink.

144
00:09:50,125 --> 00:09:51,707
Where are we going, Dubai?

145
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:54,499
You are so funny, Kat.

146
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:57,207
Look, I'm not saying I'm getting
married just so we can see you again,

147
00:09:57,208 --> 00:10:00,290
-but babes, it's been too long. Crazy.
-Way too long.

148
00:10:00,291 --> 00:10:03,332
And you all look so
perfect and professional,

149
00:10:03,333 --> 00:10:06,374
and just, um... and this place?

150
00:10:06,375 --> 00:10:08,249
Remember our flat in Brixton?

151
00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:11,624
We were crazy. I do
kind of miss those days.

152
00:10:11,625 --> 00:10:13,249
Oh, I don't. Perma hangover.

153
00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:15,374
Greasy takeaway at 5:00 AM.

154
00:10:15,375 --> 00:10:17,583
You know, I still
order from Zing Palace.

155
00:10:18,875 --> 00:10:19,875
Why?

156
00:10:21,666 --> 00:10:23,707
Oh, are you joking? Okay.

157
00:10:23,708 --> 00:10:25,624
Yeah.

158
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:29,916
Yeah. I mean, I do
sometimes, but, you know.

159
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,625
How is it going with the comedy?

160
00:10:34,666 --> 00:10:37,999
-Someone said that you're teaching?
-You're a teacher?

161
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,207
-Oh, so good to give back.
-Oh, no, no, no.

162
00:10:39,208 --> 00:10:41,582
I'm not like, um,
a teacher-teacher.

163
00:10:41,583 --> 00:10:43,832
I'm just doing it for
right now, you know?

164
00:10:43,833 --> 00:10:46,165
You know, if you need money,
we can always lend you.

165
00:10:46,166 --> 00:10:49,415
-Oh, yes!
-Oh, no, no, no. I'm fine, I'm fine.

166
00:10:49,416 --> 00:10:51,540
I'm gonna be rewriting
my solo show.

167
00:10:51,541 --> 00:10:54,665
And, you know, if I get
it produced, that is...

168
00:10:54,666 --> 00:10:59,040
Babes... you're
obviously crazy talented,

169
00:10:59,041 --> 00:11:04,624
but it feels like it's been 10
years of rewriting this solo show

170
00:11:04,625 --> 00:11:10,708
and we're just worried that the
world is never gonna see what we see.

171
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,082
Right.

172
00:11:16,083 --> 00:11:20,915
Well, what I see
is empty glasses!

173
00:11:28,458 --> 00:11:29,790
Terry?

174
00:11:29,791 --> 00:11:33,040
So the Boner Pill guys tell me
you went full Daniel Day-Lewis.

175
00:11:33,041 --> 00:11:34,415
Did they like it?

176
00:11:34,416 --> 00:11:36,457
<i>Marlon, this actor
you're trying to be,</i>

177
00:11:36,458 --> 00:11:38,207
<i>sorry, but you don't
have it in you.</i>

178
00:11:38,208 --> 00:11:40,166
I think maybe it's
time we parted ways.

179
00:11:46,208 --> 00:11:48,708
Fuck... this.

180
00:11:50,833 --> 00:11:51,957
Hugo...

181
00:11:51,958 --> 00:11:54,165
-Oh, Sam, it's Hugh.
-A quick one, yeah?

182
00:11:54,166 --> 00:11:56,766
Uh, I'm just heading out for a
pint and I wondered if you're free.

183
00:11:57,666 --> 00:12:00,582
Who, me? Yeah, I got...
sure, yeah, of course.

184
00:12:00,583 --> 00:12:02,249
Oh, sweet. Would you mind
popping over to my desk

185
00:12:02,250 --> 00:12:04,040
and sorting out the
tangled wires and shit?

186
00:12:04,041 --> 00:12:06,082
Cheers, mate. Thanks.

187
00:12:13,583 --> 00:12:16,665
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
Kat Boyles</i>.

188
00:12:18,583 --> 00:12:21,415
Thank you. Thank you, thank
you so much, everyone.

189
00:12:21,416 --> 00:12:23,040
Again, I'm Kat. I
coach improv here,

190
00:12:23,041 --> 00:12:25,749
which you can tell from how
well I moved that chair.

191
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,874
These guys have worked so
hard over the last two weeks

192
00:12:29,875 --> 00:12:33,290
and they are ready to rock,
so shall we get them in?

193
00:12:33,291 --> 00:12:36,082
-Yeah!
-Come on in, everyone!

194
00:12:37,666 --> 00:12:39,375
Isn't it?

195
00:12:41,625 --> 00:12:42,625
Hey.

196
00:12:44,666 --> 00:12:46,333
Done a great job with this lot.

197
00:12:48,666 --> 00:12:50,915
-Thanks.
-Listen, uh...

198
00:12:50,916 --> 00:12:53,207
I don't know what your
availabilities are,

199
00:12:53,208 --> 00:12:56,750
but, um, I'm looking to work
with someone just like you.

200
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:02,250
Oh. Are you like an
agent, producer, or...

201
00:13:04,541 --> 00:13:05,958
Detective Sergeant.

202
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,457
It's a program the Met have
been running for the last year.

203
00:13:11,458 --> 00:13:15,790
Using improvisers for low-level
stings to bust counterfeiters,

204
00:13:15,791 --> 00:13:18,957
unlicensed bookies, you
know, that kind of thing.

205
00:13:18,958 --> 00:13:22,624
-Why improvisers?
-Crooks spot the police a mile off,

206
00:13:22,625 --> 00:13:25,916
plus, we're not so good at
thinking on our feet. But you are.

207
00:13:27,041 --> 00:13:29,915
In fact, I've been watching
you for a while now,

208
00:13:29,916 --> 00:13:32,082
and I can see you're
one of the best.

209
00:13:33,833 --> 00:13:36,957
You'd have backup, so
it's negligible risk.

210
00:13:36,958 --> 00:13:38,832
So is this like a
volunteer thing?

211
00:13:38,833 --> 00:13:42,207
Two hundred quid a pop. Each.

212
00:13:42,208 --> 00:13:43,374
Each?

213
00:13:43,375 --> 00:13:47,000
Operatives work in threes.
Your call who to bring in.

214
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,333
Think it over.

215
00:13:56,166 --> 00:13:59,832
Well, this is the craziest
safari I've ever been on!

216
00:13:59,833 --> 00:14:01,749
Is this ride definitely safe?

217
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:04,665
Have no complaints.
Just funerals.

218
00:14:05,916 --> 00:14:08,665
Hey. So, I've got exciting news.

219
00:14:08,666 --> 00:14:12,082
We know. Never thought it would
happen literally on the night.

220
00:14:12,083 --> 00:14:14,582
-What? What happened?
-We got signed!

221
00:14:14,583 --> 00:14:16,291
That's what you meant, right?

222
00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:20,082
Yes. Yeah!

223
00:14:20,083 --> 00:14:23,874
-She's taking us to Soho House!
-Thank you for everything, Kat.

224
00:14:23,875 --> 00:14:26,749
-You are an amazing teacher.
-You're the best.

225
00:14:46,625 --> 00:14:48,749
Okay. So here's the deal.

226
00:14:48,750 --> 00:14:52,540
Two hundred each, and we'd
be doing a public service.

227
00:14:52,541 --> 00:14:56,124
I dunno. I got into improv to help
my character work, not the cops.

228
00:14:56,125 --> 00:14:57,749
This is character work.

229
00:14:57,750 --> 00:14:58,833
Well, I suppose...

230
00:15:00,083 --> 00:15:02,040
we're sort of going undercover.

231
00:15:02,041 --> 00:15:04,457
Well, we just go
and buy something.

232
00:15:04,458 --> 00:15:06,249
I could write a whole backstory.

233
00:15:06,250 --> 00:15:07,540
You could.

234
00:15:07,541 --> 00:15:09,124
"Who is this guy?

235
00:15:09,125 --> 00:15:13,332
Why is he buying fake
handbags, what does he know?"

236
00:15:13,333 --> 00:15:17,040
Uh-huh. Hugh? You in?

237
00:15:17,041 --> 00:15:19,374
Oh, gosh. Police.

238
00:15:19,375 --> 00:15:22,457
Gets your blood pumping just
saying the word, doesn't it?

239
00:15:22,458 --> 00:15:25,332
I don't know, it might be
tricky getting time off work.

240
00:15:25,333 --> 00:15:28,457
Dude. Can you imagine the
stories you can tell at work

241
00:15:28,458 --> 00:15:31,166
once you've done
stings for the police?

242
00:15:34,250 --> 00:15:35,957
What are we thinking
for costume?

243
00:15:52,791 --> 00:15:55,124
The fuck's that on your face?

244
00:15:55,125 --> 00:15:58,082
Too much? Fine,
I can take notes.

245
00:15:58,083 --> 00:15:59,874
Right, super simple.

246
00:15:59,875 --> 00:16:04,124
There's been a citywide uptick in
the sale of counterfeit cigarettes.

247
00:16:04,125 --> 00:16:09,040
Chock-full of all sorts of cheap
nasties. Health crisis in the making.

248
00:16:09,041 --> 00:16:13,707
We've got intel the shop
down the road is in on it.

249
00:16:13,708 --> 00:16:17,707
Pay them a visit, ask for
"something more affordable,"

250
00:16:17,708 --> 00:16:21,124
that's the code-phrase,
then buy a brick and leave.

251
00:16:21,125 --> 00:16:23,207
So we each buy one? Or...

252
00:16:23,208 --> 00:16:27,707
Oh, I forgot you're
virgins. Point. Wing. Nest.

253
00:16:27,708 --> 00:16:29,124
Point makes the order.

254
00:16:29,125 --> 00:16:31,540
Wing browses nearby,
there if needed.

255
00:16:31,541 --> 00:16:34,165
Nest is in the
doorway, on lookout.

256
00:16:34,166 --> 00:16:36,665
Here. Take this.

257
00:16:36,666 --> 00:16:39,874
Call me before entry so
I can get them on tape.

258
00:16:39,875 --> 00:16:41,332
Don't we need a wire?

259
00:16:41,333 --> 00:16:43,790
You'll get them later with the
snipers and proximity mines.

260
00:16:43,791 --> 00:16:46,874
Fucking hell. Go on, fuck off.

261
00:16:49,375 --> 00:16:53,249
Okay. So this is just
another round of improv, yes?

262
00:16:53,250 --> 00:16:55,540
So remember the
fundamentals. "Yes, and."

263
00:16:55,541 --> 00:16:57,165
What character are
you bringing in?

264
00:16:57,166 --> 00:16:58,749
I don't think we need
to bring in characters.

265
00:16:58,750 --> 00:17:01,999
Maybe a single mom, desperate 'cause
she can't afford her Marlboro reds?

266
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,915
-Sure.
-And I'm your brother.

267
00:17:03,916 --> 00:17:05,374
-Right.
-In-law.

268
00:17:05,375 --> 00:17:07,082
A cobbler who got
addicted to the shoe glue

269
00:17:07,083 --> 00:17:09,415
and lost it all on the
back streets of Manchester.

270
00:17:09,416 --> 00:17:11,249
-That got dark.
-That's cobbling.

271
00:17:11,250 --> 00:17:14,624
What about you, Hugh? Any
accents up your sleeve?

272
00:17:14,625 --> 00:17:16,249
-"Aye up y'fokin pillock!"
-Jesus Christ.

273
00:17:16,250 --> 00:17:17,832
-I think just leave it.
-I'm... I agree.

274
00:17:17,833 --> 00:17:20,124
-I'm sorry, it's just I'm nervous.
-Listen, listen, don't, don't, don't.

275
00:17:20,125 --> 00:17:24,665
Relax, relax, relax. Just
follow my lead. Okay?

276
00:17:24,666 --> 00:17:29,790
"Easiest 200 quid ever."

277
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:12,082
It's freezing outside.

278
00:18:12,083 --> 00:18:13,707
What can I get you?

279
00:18:13,708 --> 00:18:15,500
You think this is cold?

280
00:18:17,083 --> 00:18:18,500
Try winter in Manchester.

281
00:18:21,375 --> 00:18:24,749
<i>You can't resole a boot in
subzero, let me tell you.</i>

282
00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:26,083
You know him?

283
00:18:29,833 --> 00:18:33,124
Brother-in-law. Wish I didn't.

284
00:18:33,125 --> 00:18:34,415
Can I get some smokes.

285
00:18:34,416 --> 00:18:35,790
Camel, Marlboro?

286
00:18:35,791 --> 00:18:38,499
I'm looking for
something more...

287
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:40,332
Drat! Drat it! Drats.

288
00:18:40,333 --> 00:18:42,624
Sorry, Kat. No, sorry, everyone.

289
00:18:42,625 --> 00:18:45,457
What's going on, eh?
You guys all together?

290
00:18:45,458 --> 00:18:47,499
That a problem, lad?

291
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:49,750
<i>We're looking for
something more</i>...

292
00:18:51,666 --> 00:18:52,958
affordable.

293
00:18:57,375 --> 00:18:59,916
Something more affordable.

294
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:06,000
Anything else?

295
00:19:07,083 --> 00:19:08,874
Yes.

296
00:19:08,875 --> 00:19:12,458
And something...

297
00:19:15,333 --> 00:19:17,040
even more affordable.

298
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,249
<i>Something spicier, yeah?</i>

299
00:19:21,250 --> 00:19:23,582
A bit of weed?

300
00:19:23,583 --> 00:19:26,749
We look like the sort of melts
that get high on baby food?

301
00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:28,332
What the fuck?

302
00:19:28,333 --> 00:19:31,124
How do I know
you're not coppers?

303
00:19:39,791 --> 00:19:44,541
Call that strike one, eh? Ask again and
I'll take your tongue out your head.

304
00:19:46,041 --> 00:19:49,540
-You heard the man.
-How much you looking to spend?

305
00:19:49,541 --> 00:19:51,874
-How much you got?
-Buying to sell?

306
00:19:51,875 --> 00:19:54,833
-Smarter than you look.
-Let me make a call, yeah?

307
00:19:58,125 --> 00:19:59,790
What the fuck are you doing?

308
00:19:59,791 --> 00:20:01,832
It's not my fault, Hugh's
the one who escalated it.

309
00:20:01,833 --> 00:20:04,457
-They were slippery crisps!
-Let's just buy the cigarettes and go.

310
00:20:04,458 --> 00:20:06,082
And block the scene? That's
not what you you taught us.

311
00:20:06,083 --> 00:20:08,291
-He's coming. He's coming.
-Shit.

312
00:20:10,291 --> 00:20:11,207
Not here.

313
00:20:11,208 --> 00:20:12,458
Follow me, yeah.

314
00:20:18,125 --> 00:20:20,290
Fucking idiots.

315
00:20:35,375 --> 00:20:36,915
Pump the sounds, lad.

316
00:20:57,875 --> 00:21:00,083
Buying in bulk. I've
cleared it with him.

317
00:21:01,125 --> 00:21:02,374
Weapons in the box.

318
00:21:13,916 --> 00:21:15,458
Oh, Jesus Christ.

319
00:21:17,041 --> 00:21:19,749
-All right. We're square. It's done.
-Yeah.

320
00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:21,708
Yeah. Come on. Pull
yourself together.

321
00:21:23,625 --> 00:21:25,499
Good boy... good boy.

322
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:27,374
No doctors, yeah?

323
00:21:27,375 --> 00:21:28,457
Buyers are here.

324
00:21:28,458 --> 00:21:30,500
All right. Take him out of here.

325
00:21:41,375 --> 00:21:42,750
Buyers, eh?

326
00:21:44,041 --> 00:21:45,875
He looks like a
fucking accountant.

327
00:21:47,541 --> 00:21:49,832
He's our "in" to the city crowd.

328
00:21:49,833 --> 00:21:51,665
Got his start in
securities fraud

329
00:21:51,666 --> 00:21:54,832
then pivoted to after-hours
supply when regulators got wise.

330
00:21:54,833 --> 00:21:57,416
First name terms with
every CEO in London.

331
00:21:58,791 --> 00:22:02,166
They call him "The Squire."

332
00:22:05,875 --> 00:22:07,790
Good day, sir.

333
00:22:07,791 --> 00:22:10,250
So, that's why he's dressed
like a fucking cunt?

334
00:22:11,750 --> 00:22:14,415
Yeah, exactly.

335
00:22:14,416 --> 00:22:15,624
The Yank?

336
00:22:15,625 --> 00:22:18,749
-I had to get out of Chicago.
-Oh. Too much heat?

337
00:22:18,750 --> 00:22:19,999
Not enough.

338
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,290
Oh.

339
00:22:21,291 --> 00:22:23,207
Sick of the small time.

340
00:22:23,208 --> 00:22:25,290
So, you're big timers?

341
00:22:25,291 --> 00:22:28,790
-How come I've never heard of you?
-Clients demand discretion.

342
00:22:28,791 --> 00:22:30,749
Oh.

343
00:22:30,750 --> 00:22:34,457
We're only off-patch 'cause we
had some bad shit that went down.

344
00:22:34,458 --> 00:22:36,749
Few toffs snuffed
it, who gives a fuck?

345
00:22:36,750 --> 00:22:37,958
It's bad for business.

346
00:22:39,458 --> 00:22:40,999
We need a new supply.

347
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,166
All right.

348
00:22:43,416 --> 00:22:45,415
Small operation,

349
00:22:45,416 --> 00:22:47,250
targeted market.

350
00:22:52,083 --> 00:22:53,166
Name's Fly.

351
00:22:54,333 --> 00:22:55,999
Bonnie.

352
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,125
I'm guessing you're
the brains, Bonnie.

353
00:23:00,416 --> 00:23:02,958
Roach. The muscle.

354
00:23:04,166 --> 00:23:05,499
The Squire.

355
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:07,999
The...

356
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,083
squire.

357
00:23:12,166 --> 00:23:13,166
Shosh.

358
00:23:24,625 --> 00:23:26,124
Albanian hookup.

359
00:23:26,125 --> 00:23:29,165
Got a good rate, if you follow,

360
00:23:29,166 --> 00:23:31,374
so I need it gone.

361
00:23:31,375 --> 00:23:34,583
Three bricks. Call it 50K?

362
00:23:35,958 --> 00:23:38,541
It's legit. 70%.

363
00:23:40,791 --> 00:23:42,375
Who's your nose?

364
00:23:44,625 --> 00:23:46,499
Squire? Come on.

365
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:48,290
Um...

366
00:23:48,291 --> 00:23:50,041
Come on. Have a seat.

367
00:23:58,166 --> 00:24:01,582
-Go ahead.
-Oh, I don't... I don't really do...

368
00:24:01,583 --> 00:24:03,832
do the whole kind of key thing.

369
00:24:03,833 --> 00:24:05,165
-All right.
-Mm-hmm.

370
00:24:05,166 --> 00:24:06,999
You want a proper line?

371
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,249
Um...

372
00:24:08,250 --> 00:24:11,374
Little Lord Fauntleroy
wants a proper line.

373
00:24:11,375 --> 00:24:13,666
-All right.
-Sure.

374
00:24:15,541 --> 00:24:16,583
Go on.

375
00:24:18,833 --> 00:24:22,082
Oh, thank you very
much. That's very kind.

376
00:24:22,083 --> 00:24:23,166
Thank you.

377
00:24:28,541 --> 00:24:29,625
Okay.

378
00:24:33,333 --> 00:24:36,999
Oh, shit.

379
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,708
Oh, my God.

380
00:24:39,708 --> 00:24:43,999
Very nice... very
nice. Yeah, good.

381
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,874
Happy days?

382
00:24:45,875 --> 00:24:48,041
How do we know the
rest ain't flour?

383
00:24:53,583 --> 00:24:54,625
Go on.

384
00:25:03,125 --> 00:25:07,999
No, that's definitely
not flour, is it?

385
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,665
That is cocaine. Yeah.

386
00:25:09,666 --> 00:25:10,665
Yup.

387
00:25:10,666 --> 00:25:12,040
Good to confirm.

388
00:25:12,041 --> 00:25:15,041
That is cocaine.

389
00:25:16,250 --> 00:25:17,540
Just one more.

390
00:25:17,541 --> 00:25:20,832
-Mm-hmm.
-Okay.

391
00:25:30,166 --> 00:25:31,166
Skender...

392
00:25:32,875 --> 00:25:34,374
good to see you again.

393
00:25:34,375 --> 00:25:35,499
You take our coke?

394
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:37,082
Huh?

395
00:25:37,083 --> 00:25:39,832
You take our fucking coke?

396
00:25:39,833 --> 00:25:40,833
This is it?

397
00:25:42,333 --> 00:25:45,457
Where is the rest, huh?

398
00:25:45,458 --> 00:25:48,708
Up his nose?

399
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:52,040
That's our coke.

400
00:25:52,041 --> 00:25:53,665
They didn't steal from you.

401
00:25:53,666 --> 00:25:55,374
They're buying from us.

402
00:25:55,375 --> 00:25:56,790
Let him go.

403
00:25:56,791 --> 00:25:58,458
You're embarrassing yourself.

404
00:26:00,791 --> 00:26:02,374
And who the fuck are you?

405
00:26:02,375 --> 00:26:03,915
Skender, that's a
bit disrespectful.

406
00:26:03,916 --> 00:26:09,165
Boys, this is not my beef.

407
00:26:09,166 --> 00:26:13,457
But if you're, uh,
looking to buy,

408
00:26:13,458 --> 00:26:15,832
your competition here
just offered us 50.

409
00:26:15,833 --> 00:26:17,916
So, do we have another bidder?

410
00:26:21,708 --> 00:26:24,082
All right, 50's fair.

411
00:26:24,083 --> 00:26:25,500
He ain't gonna raise.

412
00:26:28,083 --> 00:26:29,374
I'll give you 60.

413
00:26:29,375 --> 00:26:32,166
Call it 80 or fuck off.

414
00:26:33,208 --> 00:26:34,208
What?

415
00:26:36,083 --> 00:26:37,083
Do it.

416
00:26:38,875 --> 00:26:41,207
Make me feel alive.

417
00:26:41,208 --> 00:26:43,665
It is so good to feel alive,
like really buzzing and light

418
00:26:43,666 --> 00:26:46,207
and connected on the cellular
level. 'Cause like what is life?

419
00:26:46,208 --> 00:26:49,165
Is time really linear, or in a way,
we're just living through everything

420
00:26:49,166 --> 00:26:50,374
that ever happened
all at the same time?

421
00:26:50,375 --> 00:26:51,541
Shut the fuck up!

422
00:27:04,916 --> 00:27:06,041
It's all there.

423
00:27:07,833 --> 00:27:10,750
Fuck you, bitch.

424
00:27:20,416 --> 00:27:25,541
Fucking hell.

425
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,541
You sold him back his own coke.

426
00:27:32,250 --> 00:27:34,041
You're fucking mad.

427
00:27:41,041 --> 00:27:42,415
All right. Listen.

428
00:27:42,416 --> 00:27:44,290
If your bad batch
spooked your customers,

429
00:27:44,291 --> 00:27:46,249
there's work for you here.

430
00:27:46,250 --> 00:27:49,166
I could do with people who
can think on their feet, huh.

431
00:27:59,583 --> 00:28:00,915
-Ow!
-Whoo, that was real.

432
00:28:00,916 --> 00:28:02,165
My heart's going haywire.

433
00:28:02,166 --> 00:28:03,582
Fuck. What the fuck?

434
00:28:03,583 --> 00:28:07,874
Guys. Guys. I'm so sorry. I
think I'm actually gonna die.

435
00:28:07,875 --> 00:28:10,124
Hey, hey, you were so good.

436
00:28:10,125 --> 00:28:12,415
-No, no, you don't understand.
-You've committed. It was inspiring.

437
00:28:12,416 --> 00:28:14,457
-I don't do drugs.
-Jesus Christ! What the fuck?

438
00:28:14,458 --> 00:28:15,458
What the fuck?

439
00:28:17,166 --> 00:28:20,124
All you had to do was
buy the cigarettes.

440
00:28:20,125 --> 00:28:24,040
But no, you come back bleeding,
coked up, and covered in sick.

441
00:28:24,041 --> 00:28:25,790
Fly could have killed you.

442
00:28:25,791 --> 00:28:27,416
I'm really sorry.

443
00:28:30,458 --> 00:28:31,625
But he didn't.

444
00:28:35,250 --> 00:28:36,749
You have to go back in.

445
00:28:36,750 --> 00:28:37,874
What?

446
00:28:37,875 --> 00:28:40,290
You could infiltrate his crew.

447
00:28:40,291 --> 00:28:42,707
Fly moves 10 mil a year.

448
00:28:42,708 --> 00:28:46,957
If you get tabs on
his next deal, my God,

449
00:28:46,958 --> 00:28:48,624
that'll be huge for the Met.

450
00:28:48,625 --> 00:28:51,249
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa. We almost died.

451
00:28:51,250 --> 00:28:53,915
-I think I still might.
-I mean, we were pretty damn good.

452
00:28:53,916 --> 00:28:56,665
Marlon, no fucking way. This is
getting completely out of control.

453
00:28:56,666 --> 00:28:59,249
Okay. Okay. Forget the police.

454
00:28:59,250 --> 00:29:00,708
This could be huge for you.

455
00:29:02,458 --> 00:29:05,207
"Improv comics take
down criminal empire."

456
00:29:05,208 --> 00:29:09,207
You heard of Donnie
Brasco? Serpico? Yeah?

457
00:29:09,208 --> 00:29:10,791
You'd be heroes.

458
00:29:12,375 --> 00:29:14,333
How many rejections
have you faced?

459
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:18,791
How many times have you been
made to feel like a nobody?

460
00:29:20,041 --> 00:29:23,041
Today, I saw what you could do.

461
00:29:26,208 --> 00:29:28,041
Don't you want the world to see?

462
00:29:45,458 --> 00:29:50,332
Penetrating Fly's gang takes you well
beyond the remit of this program.

463
00:29:50,333 --> 00:29:52,332
You're going deep cover.

464
00:29:52,333 --> 00:29:53,999
To all intents and purposes,

465
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,540
you are Bonnie,

466
00:29:56,541 --> 00:29:59,249
Roach, and The Squire.

467
00:29:59,250 --> 00:30:03,332
The only person who knows
your real identities is me.

468
00:30:03,333 --> 00:30:06,665
<i>Now, the rules of undercover
policing are simple.</i>

469
00:30:06,666 --> 00:30:08,874
<i>Never break character. Say yes.</i>

470
00:30:08,875 --> 00:30:11,499
<i>And always, always
trust your partner.</i>

471
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:15,208
<i>Remember, we need info on
Fly's next supply deal.</i>

472
00:30:17,583 --> 00:30:18,915
I need to frisk ya.

473
00:30:18,916 --> 00:30:21,457
-<i>So, trust your skills.</i>
-You need to fuck off.

474
00:30:21,458 --> 00:30:22,999
<i>Trust each other.</i>

475
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,040
-He stutter?
-<i>And trust me,</i>

476
00:30:25,041 --> 00:30:26,791
you will be heroes.

477
00:30:31,125 --> 00:30:32,125
Thank you.

478
00:30:40,250 --> 00:30:41,333
Fly's back there.

479
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:48,915
A lady in need.

480
00:30:48,916 --> 00:30:50,582
'Cause I need a man?

481
00:30:50,583 --> 00:30:55,333
No. God, no. You are a
fantastic, strong, uh, bull.

482
00:30:57,375 --> 00:31:01,874
No, I just meant, uh, a lady in
need of a... of a bigger challenge.

483
00:31:01,875 --> 00:31:03,249
That's what I...

484
00:31:04,416 --> 00:31:07,708
Yeah.

485
00:31:08,833 --> 00:31:11,500
Ah, it's the city slickers.

486
00:31:12,625 --> 00:31:13,790
Wondered if you'd show.

487
00:31:13,791 --> 00:31:16,082
Yeah. We're gonna close
up shop for a while.

488
00:31:16,083 --> 00:31:17,874
Lay low.

489
00:31:17,875 --> 00:31:20,666
Well, there's nothing
really doing right now.

490
00:31:21,791 --> 00:31:22,791
But...

491
00:31:24,458 --> 00:31:28,207
this prick owes me 20 grand.

492
00:31:28,208 --> 00:31:30,625
I want you to go
and shake him down.

493
00:31:33,583 --> 00:31:35,207
Oh, Pinot noir, lovely drop.

494
00:31:35,208 --> 00:31:37,874
Yeah, it's smooth, with
a chocolate finish.

495
00:31:37,875 --> 00:31:40,082
You're strange.

496
00:31:40,083 --> 00:31:41,874
But also polite.

497
00:31:41,875 --> 00:31:43,290
And well dressed.

498
00:31:43,291 --> 00:31:45,540
You remind me of that movie.

499
00:31:45,541 --> 00:31:47,124
Bond?

500
00:31:47,125 --> 00:31:49,457
<i>Paddington.</i>

501
00:31:49,458 --> 00:31:50,957
Yes.

502
00:31:50,958 --> 00:31:52,832
Yeah. Uh, so we're going.

503
00:31:52,833 --> 00:31:57,041
Um, for what it's worth,
you're quite strange, too.

504
00:31:59,125 --> 00:32:01,124
So, we don't actually do this?

505
00:32:01,125 --> 00:32:02,332
<i>Of course, you do.</i>

506
00:32:02,333 --> 00:32:05,540
Pass the test, go
deeper, gain Fly's trust.

507
00:32:05,541 --> 00:32:07,707
I really don't like the sound
of it, what if he's got a gun?

508
00:32:07,708 --> 00:32:09,582
Mm. Maybe we should
go in strapped.

509
00:32:09,583 --> 00:32:11,582
"Strapped," Marlon? What
are you talking about?

510
00:32:11,583 --> 00:32:14,374
It's what Roach would say. Please
don't pull me out of character.

511
00:32:14,375 --> 00:32:17,124
Listen, this bozo's not
gonna fuck with Fly.

512
00:32:17,125 --> 00:32:20,249
And I'm on standby in case
it goes south, but it won't.

513
00:32:20,250 --> 00:32:22,374
Worst case, we've
got The Squire.

514
00:32:22,375 --> 00:32:23,915
That doesn't even mean anything.

515
00:32:23,916 --> 00:32:26,832
<i>You're gonna be fine.
Low risk, high reward.</i>

516
00:32:26,833 --> 00:32:29,000
Now, shut the fuck up and go.

517
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,582
<i>What if he doesn't pay?</i>

518
00:32:31,583 --> 00:32:34,832
I'll make him. This fuck's
crossed me too many times.

519
00:32:34,833 --> 00:32:36,457
Do you know him?
Is he violent?

520
00:32:36,458 --> 00:32:38,124
Just ignore him.
He's being method.

521
00:32:38,125 --> 00:32:40,540
I'm sorry. What happened to
"commit to your character"?

522
00:32:40,541 --> 00:32:43,207
If things go sideways,
just throw in a grenade.

523
00:32:43,208 --> 00:32:45,040
-A grenade?
-A curveball.

524
00:32:45,041 --> 00:32:46,540
Something he won't see coming.

525
00:32:46,541 --> 00:32:48,790
Hey, hey, hey, hey,
hey, listen, listen.

526
00:32:48,791 --> 00:32:51,874
But most important is
trust your gut, remember?

527
00:32:51,875 --> 00:32:53,249
Mm-hmm.

528
00:32:53,250 --> 00:32:54,665
Right.

529
00:32:54,666 --> 00:32:57,583
Time to get revenge for
what happened in Milan.

530
00:33:00,041 --> 00:33:01,416
It's this way.

531
00:33:03,208 --> 00:33:07,749
Roach has no sense of
direction. Interesting.

532
00:33:22,541 --> 00:33:24,415
Where's the fucking cash, Sagar?

533
00:33:24,416 --> 00:33:25,832
Hey, hey, hey, easy, easy.

534
00:33:25,833 --> 00:33:27,957
Give us the money and
we leave you in peace.

535
00:33:27,958 --> 00:33:29,332
Tell Fly I'm good for it.

536
00:33:29,333 --> 00:33:31,458
Oh. So we're doing
this the hard way?

537
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:33,957
You want The Squire?

538
00:33:33,958 --> 00:33:35,250
Who's The Squire?

539
00:33:36,750 --> 00:33:37,958
Um...

540
00:33:45,750 --> 00:33:47,416
Sorry.

541
00:33:51,041 --> 00:33:52,582
What the fuck?

542
00:33:52,583 --> 00:33:55,290
Hold him down.
Take his dick out.

543
00:33:55,291 --> 00:33:57,499
-Whoa. Whoa. Whoa.
-Hold him down.

544
00:33:57,500 --> 00:34:00,416
-Take his fucking dick out!
-Wait, wait, wait. Stop. Stop. Stop.

545
00:34:01,708 --> 00:34:02,875
I have it.

546
00:34:05,666 --> 00:34:07,249
Where'd you think you're going?

547
00:34:07,250 --> 00:34:09,458
The cash is in my gym bag.

548
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,208
Oh, yeah?

549
00:34:14,791 --> 00:34:15,791
This gym bag?

550
00:34:16,875 --> 00:34:17,957
Holy shit.

551
00:34:17,958 --> 00:34:19,749
Were you gonna shank us, Sagar?

552
00:34:19,750 --> 00:34:21,374
Youse lot need to calm down.

553
00:34:21,375 --> 00:34:23,374
Hey, I ain't going nowhere.

554
00:34:23,375 --> 00:34:25,416
But there's something
you should know.

555
00:34:32,416 --> 00:34:35,208
-Shit.
-Fuck you, idiots.

556
00:34:36,875 --> 00:34:38,707
Ooh.

557
00:34:38,708 --> 00:34:40,083
Fuck.

558
00:34:45,250 --> 00:34:47,208
Hey, maybe he's not dead.

559
00:34:48,708 --> 00:34:51,082
-Sagar, Sagar, mate.
-He's definitely dead.

560
00:34:51,083 --> 00:34:52,707
What the fuck did we do?

561
00:34:52,708 --> 00:34:56,124
No, no, no, no, no. Christ. No.

562
00:34:56,125 --> 00:34:59,416
Come on. Let's get
this cash back to Fly.

563
00:35:01,250 --> 00:35:02,624
Marlon.

564
00:35:02,625 --> 00:35:04,166
Need proof of death.

565
00:35:09,750 --> 00:35:13,416
Mess with the bull,
you get the horns.

566
00:35:16,500 --> 00:35:18,415
Stay calm, these things happen.

567
00:35:18,416 --> 00:35:20,290
No. Sorry, this has
never happened to me.

568
00:35:20,291 --> 00:35:21,540
That's what you signed up for.

569
00:35:21,541 --> 00:35:23,499
We did not sign
up to kill people.

570
00:35:23,500 --> 00:35:25,207
He chose to run and we just...

571
00:35:25,208 --> 00:35:27,082
Threatened to iron his dick?

572
00:35:27,083 --> 00:35:29,749
-I told you not to escalate.
-It's where the scene went.

573
00:35:29,750 --> 00:35:32,957
It's not a scene anymore,
Marlon. This is real.

574
00:35:32,958 --> 00:35:34,082
<i>Exactly.</i>

575
00:35:34,083 --> 00:35:36,582
So, get your head
straight, the lot of you.

576
00:35:36,583 --> 00:35:40,332
'Cause otherwise you won't die
on stage, you'll fucking die.

577
00:35:40,333 --> 00:35:43,290
<i>I'll clean things up this
end. You go back to Fly,</i>

578
00:35:43,291 --> 00:35:45,624
take responsibility for the hit.

579
00:35:45,625 --> 00:35:46,624
He'll trust you now.

580
00:35:46,625 --> 00:35:48,333
<i>Eyes on the prize, Bonnie.</i>

581
00:35:50,916 --> 00:35:53,249
That's not good for
your sleep pattern.

582
00:35:53,250 --> 00:35:56,000
We saw a man die, Hugh,
pick your battles.

583
00:35:59,791 --> 00:36:01,749
What we got?

584
00:36:01,750 --> 00:36:04,041
Hit-and-run. Unknown male.

585
00:36:08,833 --> 00:36:10,082
He's not unknown.

586
00:36:10,083 --> 00:36:11,582
I'm sorry I'm late.

587
00:36:11,583 --> 00:36:12,999
Over or under?

588
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:14,374
Under, surely.

589
00:36:14,375 --> 00:36:16,833
Yes. Okay. Hello.

590
00:36:19,708 --> 00:36:21,957
Hi, uh, Inspector.

591
00:36:21,958 --> 00:36:23,832
I'm Robin Beverly,

592
00:36:23,833 --> 00:36:25,791
I'm your new deputy.

593
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,665
Just wait till City Hall
get a load of this, huh?

594
00:36:29,666 --> 00:36:30,708
What?

595
00:36:32,083 --> 00:36:34,749
Uh, wait till City Hall
get a load of this?

596
00:36:34,750 --> 00:36:37,250
Just as in, "quite serious."

597
00:36:38,625 --> 00:36:40,457
I mean, someone's dead, right?

598
00:36:40,458 --> 00:36:42,916
Not just someone. The Iceman.

599
00:36:44,083 --> 00:36:47,165
A notorious gangland assassin who's
had us chasing shadows for years.

600
00:36:47,166 --> 00:36:49,624
"Chasing shadows." This
is too wet to write on,

601
00:36:49,625 --> 00:36:51,915
so that's actually...
there's the culprit.

602
00:36:51,916 --> 00:36:54,291
And then he gets mown
down by some random drunk?

603
00:36:56,083 --> 00:36:57,750
What aren't we seeing?

604
00:36:59,833 --> 00:37:01,916
Jesus.

605
00:37:03,458 --> 00:37:05,500
So, this is where
you've been hiding.

606
00:37:09,750 --> 00:37:12,750
He was chased by assailants.

607
00:37:17,166 --> 00:37:18,375
Persuasive ones.

608
00:37:20,166 --> 00:37:21,790
-Twisted.
-Sir,

609
00:37:21,791 --> 00:37:24,665
neighbors saw three figures
standing over the body

610
00:37:24,666 --> 00:37:26,916
taking pictures of
it and talking to it.

611
00:37:28,416 --> 00:37:29,457
Who are these psychos?

612
00:37:29,458 --> 00:37:30,790
A redheaded woman,

613
00:37:30,791 --> 00:37:33,082
a thug in an army jacket,

614
00:37:33,083 --> 00:37:35,625
and a smartly dressed
South Asian male.

615
00:37:37,708 --> 00:37:40,582
No one in town would
dare go after The Iceman.

616
00:37:40,583 --> 00:37:41,875
These guys are new.

617
00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:44,666
These guys are different.

618
00:37:48,125 --> 00:37:51,415
He wouldn't pay.
He tried to run.

619
00:37:51,416 --> 00:37:55,500
So, The Squire offered him a bottle
of something nice and broken.

620
00:37:57,500 --> 00:37:59,707
Hmm. You iced The Iceman.

621
00:37:59,708 --> 00:38:01,291
-Who's that?
-The Iceman?

622
00:38:02,666 --> 00:38:04,499
Sagar was a hitman.

623
00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:06,416
In his prime, he
was one of the best.

624
00:38:07,708 --> 00:38:09,957
I had to check you
were the real deal.

625
00:38:09,958 --> 00:38:11,499
And clearly you are.

626
00:38:11,500 --> 00:38:13,499
That's your cut.

627
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:16,207
I'm glad we've got the
foreplay out of the way.

628
00:38:16,208 --> 00:38:21,540
So, you're giving us a when and
where for the major league shit?

629
00:38:21,541 --> 00:38:24,041
Maybe we should go
work for the Albanians.

630
00:38:25,250 --> 00:38:27,999
When the next shipment firms up,

631
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,458
you'll know about it.

632
00:38:30,541 --> 00:38:31,666
Yeah. That all?

633
00:38:32,916 --> 00:38:33,916
No.

634
00:38:37,208 --> 00:38:38,457
It's my birthday,

635
00:38:38,458 --> 00:38:40,415
so go and get cleaned up,

636
00:38:40,416 --> 00:38:42,624
because tonight we're
going fucking big.

637
00:38:46,541 --> 00:38:51,082
Okay. Remember,
these guys go hard.

638
00:38:51,083 --> 00:38:52,957
So, don't try to match
them drink for drink.

639
00:38:52,958 --> 00:38:56,165
Exactly. It's the pills
and lines they'll notice.

640
00:38:56,166 --> 00:38:57,726
Let's hope it's not
that kind of night.

648

It's always one who

649
00:39:47,083 --> 00:39:48,707
And it's the fucking yank!

650
00:39:48,708 --> 00:39:51,665
-Yeah, it is drama.
-You're getting all silly.

651
00:39:51,666 --> 00:39:53,500
-Kat?
-Well, wait.

652
00:39:54,916 --> 00:39:58,499
Harriet, hi. Shit. Oh, my. Hi.

653
00:39:58,500 --> 00:40:00,082
Hello.

654
00:40:00,083 --> 00:40:03,124
Are you... are you okay?

655
00:40:03,125 --> 00:40:04,374
Yeah, I'm great.

656
00:40:04,375 --> 00:40:08,124
I'm just... tonight I'm
out with some colleagues.

657
00:40:08,125 --> 00:40:11,249
Thought you said you couldn't come
tonight because you had an audition?

658
00:40:11,250 --> 00:40:14,332
-Audition?
-Yeah.

659
00:40:14,333 --> 00:40:17,124
You know, the Iceman.

660
00:40:17,125 --> 00:40:19,832
"The Iceman Cometh"?
Eugene O'Neill?

661
00:40:19,833 --> 00:40:21,999
-Oh, lovely.
-Who are these birds?

662
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,625
Birds? Wow.

663
00:40:24,875 --> 00:40:28,165
Um, they're just, you know,
some random banker bitches.

664
00:40:28,166 --> 00:40:30,957
-Huh?
-Well, off you pop, girls.

665
00:40:30,958 --> 00:40:34,415
-She's not selling tonight.
-Kat, why don't you come with us?

666
00:40:34,416 --> 00:40:36,915
The fuck do they
keep saying Kat?

667
00:40:36,916 --> 00:40:38,665
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

668
00:40:38,666 --> 00:40:41,415
It's a nickname, Ket,
like, you know, Ketamine.

669
00:40:41,416 --> 00:40:43,249
You're doing Ketamine?

670
00:40:43,250 --> 00:40:45,249
-Oh, my God.
-No. No.

671
00:40:45,250 --> 00:40:47,540
No. You should just...

672
00:40:47,541 --> 00:40:49,500
you should just...
you should go.

673
00:40:51,541 --> 00:40:54,082
Kat, don't turn to drugs

674
00:40:54,083 --> 00:40:56,665
just 'cause life hasn't
turned out how you hoped.

675
00:40:56,666 --> 00:40:58,582
No one can make a
living in comedy.

676
00:40:58,583 --> 00:41:01,040
Oh, fuck off.

677
00:41:01,041 --> 00:41:06,999
I'm actually doing something
incredible right now.

678
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:11,040
Kat, this isn't a joke. These
aren't our kind of people.

679
00:41:12,208 --> 00:41:13,457
She told you nice.

680
00:41:17,083 --> 00:41:19,999
Come on. We're going. Going.

681
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,624
Fucking fiends.

682
00:41:26,916 --> 00:41:28,500
Happy birthday, boss.

683
00:41:31,625 --> 00:41:32,625
Right.

684
00:41:34,083 --> 00:41:36,624
So how'd you get
in the game anyway?

685
00:41:36,625 --> 00:41:38,083
You?

686
00:41:39,208 --> 00:41:41,249
I've got bodies
buried in 15 states.

687
00:41:41,250 --> 00:41:42,958
I don't really do backstory.

688
00:41:44,625 --> 00:41:45,625
I do.

689
00:41:46,916 --> 00:41:50,207
Oh, yeah? What's
your story, Roach?

690
00:41:50,208 --> 00:41:51,666
I've traveled, brother.

691
00:41:53,541 --> 00:41:56,041
Ran away from my
parents when I was five.

692
00:41:57,375 --> 00:42:01,791
By the time acne was kicking in,
I was a stable boy in Zurich.

693
00:42:03,666 --> 00:42:05,665
That's where I grew entranced

694
00:42:05,666 --> 00:42:08,125
by those beasts' ancient power.

695
00:42:09,666 --> 00:42:10,666
They spoke to me.

696
00:42:11,958 --> 00:42:13,874
I became their agent
of destruction,

697
00:42:13,875 --> 00:42:17,415
burning rival barns,
spoiling their smithies.

698
00:42:17,416 --> 00:42:20,040
By the time I'd learned
to palm an ace of spades,

699
00:42:20,041 --> 00:42:23,833
well, Monte Carlo couldn't
come quick enough.

700
00:42:27,375 --> 00:42:28,708
Except it did.

701
00:42:29,708 --> 00:42:32,582
But you sound like
you're from the North?

702
00:42:32,583 --> 00:42:34,541
Then I lived in
Manchester for years.

703
00:42:37,666 --> 00:42:39,666
If I didn't know you
were the real deal,

704
00:42:40,750 --> 00:42:42,791
I'd still think you
were full of shit.

705
00:42:49,666 --> 00:42:50,958
What about you, Squire?

706
00:42:52,583 --> 00:42:55,290
Well, I worked somewhere

707
00:42:55,291 --> 00:42:58,290
where people treated
me like shit.

708
00:42:58,291 --> 00:42:59,999
Banker scum.

709
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:01,915
Yeah.

710
00:43:01,916 --> 00:43:04,457
I guess I felt pretty alone.

711
00:43:04,458 --> 00:43:07,290
Then I met these guys.

712
00:43:07,291 --> 00:43:09,790
I decided to try something new,

713
00:43:09,791 --> 00:43:14,249
something dangerous,

714
00:43:14,250 --> 00:43:15,958
and now I'm not so alone.

715
00:43:18,041 --> 00:43:20,124
How about you, Fly?

716
00:43:20,125 --> 00:43:21,999
My old man was in the game.

717
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:23,165
Hmm.

718
00:43:23,166 --> 00:43:24,791
He got shot by a copper.

719
00:43:26,125 --> 00:43:29,707
My mom went with this
right piece of shit.

720
00:43:29,708 --> 00:43:31,499
Horrible bastard he was.

721
00:43:31,500 --> 00:43:32,874
Proper bully.

722
00:43:32,875 --> 00:43:35,082
I left home when I was 14.

723
00:43:35,083 --> 00:43:38,957
I'd thought I'll make
my own way in the world

724
00:43:38,958 --> 00:43:42,999
so my little girl never has to go
through all the shit that I had to.

725
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:44,250
You have a daughter?

726
00:43:45,750 --> 00:43:46,957
Yeah.

727
00:43:46,958 --> 00:43:48,416
She's in Portugal.

728
00:43:49,458 --> 00:43:50,957
It's a different life.

729
00:43:50,958 --> 00:43:53,540
It's like the beach after school

730
00:43:53,541 --> 00:43:55,332
and fishing at the weekends.

731
00:43:55,333 --> 00:43:56,790
You got the sunshine.

732
00:43:56,791 --> 00:43:57,875
Hmm.

733
00:43:59,708 --> 00:44:01,916
I don't really like
people knowing about her.

734
00:44:03,375 --> 00:44:04,791
Then why'd you tell us?

735
00:44:11,416 --> 00:44:13,165
It's Metcalfe.

736
00:44:13,166 --> 00:44:14,540
Metcalfe?

737
00:44:14,541 --> 00:44:16,165
Who's Metcalfe?

738
00:44:16,166 --> 00:44:17,540
The boss.

739
00:44:17,541 --> 00:44:19,499
He wants to talk.

740
00:44:19,500 --> 00:44:20,750
With all of us.

741
00:44:22,291 --> 00:44:23,582
Let's get cleaned up.

742
00:44:51,208 --> 00:44:52,208
No!

743
00:44:53,791 --> 00:44:55,457
No!

744
00:44:55,458 --> 00:44:58,291
When we get in there,
don't talk to him.

745
00:45:00,083 --> 00:45:02,083
You don't even look
at him, all right?

746
00:45:11,750 --> 00:45:17,082
<i>♪ Jenga, Jenga, Jenga, Jenga ♪</i>

747
00:45:17,083 --> 00:45:20,249
What a wonderful game, eh?

748
00:45:20,250 --> 00:45:22,124
A minute to learn,

749
00:45:22,125 --> 00:45:24,332
a lifetime to master.

750
00:45:24,333 --> 00:45:27,290
And tell me, how many
other games are suitable

751
00:45:27,291 --> 00:45:31,374
for teaching important truths
about the human condition?

752
00:45:31,375 --> 00:45:35,041
Order is delicate.

753
00:45:36,833 --> 00:45:38,166
Come on, Fly. Your turn.

754
00:45:45,875 --> 00:45:49,208
Just remember,
slightest miscalculation

755
00:45:50,333 --> 00:45:52,582
and everything you've built

756
00:45:52,583 --> 00:45:54,500
comes tumbling down.

757
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:03,000
Another one.

758
00:46:05,791 --> 00:46:08,874
I heard you pinched
from the Albanians.

759
00:46:08,875 --> 00:46:11,749
And then with the help of
the three stooges here,

760
00:46:11,750 --> 00:46:13,290
you sold it back to them?

761
00:46:13,291 --> 00:46:14,707
Bit of a result actually.

762
00:46:14,708 --> 00:46:16,040
No.

763
00:46:16,041 --> 00:46:20,915
Until they ran it through their
labs and found out it was theirs.

764
00:46:20,916 --> 00:46:23,457
Miscalculation, Fly.

765
00:46:23,458 --> 00:46:25,291
-How'd you know?
-They told me.

766
00:46:26,291 --> 00:46:27,999
I'm in business with them.

767
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,291
-You made peace with the Albanians?
-Mm-hmm.

768
00:46:31,833 --> 00:46:33,415
Another one.

769
00:46:33,416 --> 00:46:37,124
I was brokering a deal to make
them my exclusive coke people,

770
00:46:37,125 --> 00:46:38,290
triple my supply.

771
00:46:38,291 --> 00:46:41,165
But suddenly my phone calls
are not being answered.

772
00:46:41,166 --> 00:46:44,915
And I found out it's
because of youse,

773
00:46:44,916 --> 00:46:47,500
youse, and youse.

774
00:46:51,291 --> 00:46:53,915
Who the fuck are they?

775
00:46:53,916 --> 00:46:55,499
They're legit.

776
00:46:55,500 --> 00:46:56,915
They did in the Iceman.

777
00:46:56,916 --> 00:47:00,040
Oh, a pensioner who could
barely do his own shoelaces.

778
00:47:00,041 --> 00:47:02,040
Whoopty fucking do.

779
00:47:02,041 --> 00:47:05,582
All right. Look, I
fucked up, right?

780
00:47:05,583 --> 00:47:07,165
I'll talk to the Albanians.

781
00:47:07,166 --> 00:47:10,457
That'd be a short conversation,
Fly, 'cause they want you dead.

782
00:47:10,458 --> 00:47:13,165
I'll talk to them.

783
00:47:13,166 --> 00:47:17,040
But just in case I'm not as
charming as I used to be,

784
00:47:17,041 --> 00:47:19,125
you'll find me a new supply.

785
00:47:29,375 --> 00:47:31,915
What, you never
seen a rat before?

786
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:36,624
Pull us out. We're done.

787
00:47:36,625 --> 00:47:37,790
I need a gun.

788
00:47:37,791 --> 00:47:41,707
Listen, you got deeper in two days
than we've managed in two years.

789
00:47:41,708 --> 00:47:44,915
-You can't quit now.
-Metcalfe's fucking insane.

790
00:47:44,916 --> 00:47:47,290
He just killed someone
right in front of us.

791
00:47:47,291 --> 00:47:49,249
-Tell him I need a gun.
-<i>I'm escalating this end.</i>

792
00:47:49,250 --> 00:47:51,082
<i>Full tactical unit on standby.</i>

793
00:47:51,083 --> 00:47:53,499
This is gonna be even
bigger than we imagined.

794
00:47:53,500 --> 00:47:55,625
-No.
-Stay in.

795
00:48:02,500 --> 00:48:04,165
Sir?

796
00:48:04,166 --> 00:48:05,916
You're gonna wanna
take a look at this.

797
00:48:09,041 --> 00:48:12,332
Sorry. I just always
wanted to say that, so...

798
00:48:12,333 --> 00:48:14,749
Oh, God. What a hoot.

799
00:48:14,750 --> 00:48:16,332
Which department
did you come from?

800
00:48:16,333 --> 00:48:18,332
Waterways.

801
00:48:18,333 --> 00:48:21,207
Yeah, rivers, streams.

802
00:48:21,208 --> 00:48:22,874
That's a hell of a promotion.

803
00:48:22,875 --> 00:48:24,915
Is your dad the
commissioner or something?

804
00:48:24,916 --> 00:48:29,166
No. Um, it's my uncle.

805
00:48:31,250 --> 00:48:32,582
It's from Surveillance.

806
00:48:32,583 --> 00:48:34,665
What have we got here?

807
00:48:34,666 --> 00:48:36,290
Hello, Skender.

808
00:48:36,291 --> 00:48:38,374
-Baddie?
-He killed my last partner.

809
00:48:38,375 --> 00:48:39,540
Baddie.

810
00:48:39,541 --> 00:48:41,582
Goes into Fly's.

811
00:48:41,583 --> 00:48:43,208
Comes out in one piece.

812
00:48:46,291 --> 00:48:47,541
So does Fly.

813
00:48:50,708 --> 00:48:53,040
It was a sit-down. That makes
no sense. They hate each other.

814
00:48:53,041 --> 00:48:54,457
Nobody could make them...

815
00:48:56,833 --> 00:48:58,541
Oh, shit.

816
00:49:06,083 --> 00:49:09,000
Are they in charge?

817
00:49:10,125 --> 00:49:12,332
They execute the Iceman
to make a statement.

818
00:49:12,333 --> 00:49:15,332
Then broker a deal between two
rivals to let everyone know

819
00:49:15,333 --> 00:49:17,250
-that they're the new...
-Top boy.

820
00:49:19,625 --> 00:49:20,833
Yeah, and girl.

821
00:49:22,375 --> 00:49:23,874
-And another boy.
-I understood what you meant.

822
00:49:23,875 --> 00:49:26,708
-Yes. Yeah.
-These guys are not just guns for hire.

823
00:49:28,500 --> 00:49:30,165
They're pulling the strings.

824
00:49:38,958 --> 00:49:40,040
Right.

825
00:49:40,041 --> 00:49:42,124
Metcalfe wants a new supply.

826
00:49:42,125 --> 00:49:44,915
Someone we know Stratford
way's had a shipment come in.

827
00:49:44,916 --> 00:49:46,540
-K-Lash?
-Yeah.

828
00:49:46,541 --> 00:49:48,374
What's the deal with K-Lash?

829
00:49:48,375 --> 00:49:51,915
Well, let's just
say we have history.

830
00:49:51,916 --> 00:49:53,290
So you're gonna do the deal.

831
00:49:53,291 --> 00:49:54,665
You have a little taste.

832
00:49:54,666 --> 00:49:57,416
If it's good, you buy
the lot, all right?

833
00:49:58,916 --> 00:50:00,000
Shosh will drop you.

834
00:50:04,250 --> 00:50:06,458
Are we sure this is it?
Where are street signs?

835
00:50:07,791 --> 00:50:09,874
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
What the hell is that?

836
00:50:09,875 --> 00:50:12,124
If things go sideways,
throw in a grenade.

837
00:50:12,125 --> 00:50:14,165
Not a literal grenade.

838
00:50:14,166 --> 00:50:16,749
Out here, what's the difference?

839
00:50:16,750 --> 00:50:19,083
Hey. Are you good?

840
00:50:20,291 --> 00:50:21,333
Look at me.

841
00:50:24,333 --> 00:50:25,790
Are you good?

842
00:50:25,791 --> 00:50:27,874
Yeah, Bonnie. I'm good.

843
00:50:27,875 --> 00:50:29,790

You want food, yeah?

853

No food. Drugs.

-Laughing gas.
-No, no.

861
00:51:13,833 --> 00:51:16,540
-We need coke.
-We ain't got no coke. Just nangs.

862
00:51:16,541 --> 00:51:18,457
Oi, buy the gear or fuck off.

863
00:51:18,458 --> 00:51:19,790
Is that even illegal?

864
00:51:19,791 --> 00:51:21,540
Not to possess. Just to supply.

like feds. Are you lot feds?

866

867
00:51:26,875 --> 00:51:27,958
What are you sayin'?

868
00:51:29,666 --> 00:51:30,666
What are you sayin'?

869
00:51:34,583 --> 00:51:38,165
I'm saying we're here for
class As, not party balloons.

870
00:51:38,166 --> 00:51:39,832
So unless you've got
something serious to share,

871
00:51:39,833 --> 00:51:42,540
we'll leave you pricks to
your fucking sleepover.

872
00:51:47,875 --> 00:51:49,041
What you sayin' now?

873
00:51:50,333 --> 00:51:51,333
Hmm?

874
00:51:52,416 --> 00:51:54,207
What are you saying now?

875
00:51:54,208 --> 00:51:56,041
Here's what I'm saying now.

876
00:51:58,541 --> 00:51:59,665
Roach.

877
00:51:59,666 --> 00:52:02,041
Roach, fucking chill.

878
00:52:03,916 --> 00:52:05,875
It's a fucking grenade, guys.

879
00:52:23,458 --> 00:52:25,707
Oh, mate.

880
00:52:25,708 --> 00:52:27,165
Okay. Run!

881
00:52:44,958 --> 00:52:46,665
It's locked.

882
00:52:49,083 --> 00:52:50,958
I can't hold them. Go!

883
00:53:00,958 --> 00:53:02,165
Are you lost?

884
00:53:02,166 --> 00:53:03,291
What the hell?

885
00:53:08,375 --> 00:53:09,499
They're coming! They're coming!

886
00:53:09,500 --> 00:53:10,665
-They're coming!
-Go, go, go, go, go!

887
00:53:10,666 --> 00:53:11,750
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go!

888
00:53:28,208 --> 00:53:29,625
Oh, shit!

889
00:53:31,833 --> 00:53:32,957
What the fuck?

890
00:53:32,958 --> 00:53:34,457
How did this pass
Building Control?

891
00:53:34,458 --> 00:53:35,957
-I always knew it would end like this.
-Okay. Okay. You got us.

892
00:53:35,958 --> 00:53:37,332
Don't shank me. Don't shank
her. Just don't shank any of us.

893
00:53:37,333 --> 00:53:40,250
-Just stop it.
-Shh.

894
00:53:46,208 --> 00:53:48,290
We're done, yeah?

895
00:53:48,291 --> 00:53:50,249
Police! Hit the ground!

896
00:53:58,000 --> 00:53:59,207
Finally.

897
00:53:59,208 --> 00:54:02,041
Where's the coke, huh?

898
00:54:05,750 --> 00:54:06,874
Nangs?

899
00:54:06,875 --> 00:54:08,999
We need help. Marlon's cut.

900
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:10,415
-Stay still. Stay still.
-Leave it. Leave it.

901
00:54:10,416 --> 00:54:12,582
It only scars if
you let it bleed.

902
00:54:12,583 --> 00:54:14,250
What the fuck's this?

903
00:54:15,583 --> 00:54:16,665
Where is the money?

904
00:54:16,666 --> 00:54:18,125
It's here. Jesus Christ.

905
00:54:20,875 --> 00:54:21,916
That's it?

906
00:54:23,875 --> 00:54:25,165
I thought this was big.

907
00:54:25,166 --> 00:54:26,582
It was just a taste.

908
00:54:26,583 --> 00:54:28,750
Oh, fuckin' hell.

909
00:54:30,666 --> 00:54:31,666
Wait.

910
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:36,165
Where's the tactical unit?

911
00:54:36,166 --> 00:54:37,915
Uh, it's complicated.

912
00:54:37,916 --> 00:54:40,083
Now, get out of here. I've
got to clean this lot up.

913
00:54:41,083 --> 00:54:42,583
No, no, no, no, no.

914
00:54:43,791 --> 00:54:46,458
We're not putting our lives
on the line for a dirty cop.

915
00:54:50,708 --> 00:54:53,250
Oh. You want out, do you?

916
00:54:54,791 --> 00:54:57,875
Go back to comedy like there's
no dead body in the morgue?

917
00:54:58,958 --> 00:55:00,957
You killed a man.

918
00:55:00,958 --> 00:55:02,249
Working for you.

919
00:55:02,250 --> 00:55:04,957
They don't know that.
You're deep cover.

920
00:55:04,958 --> 00:55:07,083
As far as they're
concerned, you work for Fly.

921
00:55:08,416 --> 00:55:10,415
Fucking idiots.

922
00:55:10,416 --> 00:55:12,916
And I sent you back in
to pay for my retirement.

923
00:55:14,083 --> 00:55:16,332
And I chose actors

924
00:55:16,333 --> 00:55:20,041
because you're the only ones
desperate enough to say yes.

925
00:55:21,208 --> 00:55:24,832
So until I see a real payday,

926
00:55:24,833 --> 00:55:26,207
you're staying in.

927
00:55:26,208 --> 00:55:28,333
-Fuck off!
-You got no choice.

928
00:55:29,458 --> 00:55:31,332
All the files that ID you

929
00:55:31,333 --> 00:55:34,583
as legitimate moles are
encrypted right here.

930
00:55:36,333 --> 00:55:37,583
Go ahead. Take it.

931
00:55:39,291 --> 00:55:42,332
Yeah.

932
00:55:42,333 --> 00:55:44,707
So we understand each other.

933
00:55:44,708 --> 00:55:46,457
I'm getting what I need,

934
00:55:46,458 --> 00:55:50,207
and until then if I say
"jump," you say "how..."

935
00:56:05,500 --> 00:56:06,500
Fucking cops.

936
00:56:13,375 --> 00:56:14,458
Let's get him out of here.

937
00:56:16,791 --> 00:56:19,999
Fucking laughing gas?

938
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:21,290
I had bad intel.

939
00:56:21,291 --> 00:56:24,957
Unlike the piggie wiggie here
who somehow knew to be there.

940
00:56:24,958 --> 00:56:26,458
I think he was tipped.

941
00:56:27,875 --> 00:56:28,957
That's why I went in.

942
00:56:28,958 --> 00:56:31,333
I saw his car outside
the club last week.

943
00:56:33,166 --> 00:56:34,624
Someone's flipped.

944
00:56:34,625 --> 00:56:36,415
Ooh.

945
00:56:36,416 --> 00:56:38,583
Hunting season.

946
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:44,707
The Glorious 12th for Grouse,

947
00:56:44,708 --> 00:56:47,957
and the Partridge in September,
and Pheasants in October,

948
00:56:47,958 --> 00:56:52,125
and it's any fucking time
for rats, right, Fly?

949
00:56:53,458 --> 00:56:54,458
Right.

950
00:56:55,666 --> 00:56:57,624
You know what they say?

951
00:56:57,625 --> 00:57:01,249
Longer the tail,
louder the squeak.

952
00:57:01,250 --> 00:57:03,416
What you gotta say for
yourself, young man?

953
00:57:05,333 --> 00:57:07,541
I've got something
swinging between my legs

954
00:57:09,750 --> 00:57:11,250
but it ain't no tail.

955
00:57:13,625 --> 00:57:14,999
And you, young lady, huh?

956
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:17,958
Obviously, the
brains of the outfit.

957
00:57:21,458 --> 00:57:22,833
Charming.

958
00:57:24,625 --> 00:57:27,666
And you, wee man?

959
00:57:28,791 --> 00:57:31,915
Looking forward to your
next bit of cheese, huh?

960
00:57:31,916 --> 00:57:33,957
It's actually an urban
myth that rats like cheese.

961
00:57:33,958 --> 00:57:36,749
Mice do, but rats are
actually omnivores.

962
00:57:36,750 --> 00:57:39,665
But you got the fucking
mouth for it, eh?

963
00:57:39,666 --> 00:57:41,332
Stop.

964
00:57:41,333 --> 00:57:43,207
My guys almost died in there.

965
00:57:43,208 --> 00:57:44,374
It's not them.

966
00:57:44,375 --> 00:57:47,374
Then who's been squeaking
to this one, eh?

967
00:57:47,375 --> 00:57:50,916
You dirty piece of... oh.

968
00:57:53,291 --> 00:57:55,249
Hello.

969
00:57:55,250 --> 00:57:56,333
Oh.

970
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:08,416
He only ever called one number.

971
00:58:10,500 --> 00:58:11,583
Phones out.

972
00:58:19,291 --> 00:58:22,625
Now, who have you been
talking to, piggie wiggie?

973
00:58:24,333 --> 00:58:27,249
<i>It has not been possible
to connect your call.</i>

974
00:58:27,250 --> 00:58:29,750
<i>It has not been possible
to connect your call.</i>

975
00:58:36,916 --> 00:58:38,625
I'll find the rat.

976
00:58:39,708 --> 00:58:42,333
Meantime, chop him.

977
00:58:51,375 --> 00:58:53,332
Okay. I'll incinerate
the clothes.

978
00:58:53,333 --> 00:58:55,165
You hack. I'll help you dump.

979
00:58:55,166 --> 00:58:57,624
I'll meet you at Rainham
Marshes in an hour.

980
00:58:57,625 --> 00:58:59,874
You okay to jack the ride?

981
00:58:59,875 --> 00:59:01,707
Of course.

982
00:59:01,708 --> 00:59:02,791
Do you need a caddick?

983
00:59:04,083 --> 00:59:07,999
Yeah. Yes, if you got one.

984
00:59:11,500 --> 00:59:13,207
Oh, yeah.

985
00:59:13,208 --> 00:59:15,707
Good old caddick.

986
00:59:15,708 --> 00:59:19,124
-Thank you very much.
-That one is weighted for me.

987
00:59:19,125 --> 00:59:20,499
Do you want a lighter one?

988
00:59:20,500 --> 00:59:21,833
Um...

989
00:59:26,333 --> 00:59:29,582
No. I think that should
be... should be fab.

990
00:59:29,583 --> 00:59:31,208
-Do you wanna check?
-Check?

991
00:59:32,250 --> 00:59:34,915
On... on the body?

992
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:44,083
Just checking the proportions.

993
00:59:45,458 --> 00:59:47,040
You all right? That's
how you use a caddick<i>?</i>

994
00:59:47,041 --> 00:59:48,999
Yeah, it's a house...
a house style.

995
00:59:51,250 --> 00:59:52,250
Bye.

996
00:59:54,375 --> 00:59:56,249
I can't do this.
I can't do this.

997
00:59:56,250 --> 00:59:58,415
-I cannot do this.
-Okay. Just stay calm.

998
00:59:58,416 --> 01:00:00,082
I should have never done any of this.
I should have never listened to you!

999
01:00:00,083 --> 01:00:01,249
Keep your voice down.

1000
01:00:01,250 --> 01:00:03,624
Or followed this psycho into a
drug deal waving a knife about

1001
01:00:03,625 --> 01:00:06,165
-thinking he's fucking Robert De Niro.
-Bob's an incredible actor.

1002
01:00:06,166 --> 01:00:08,665
-You're a liability!
-I had to go all in, Hugh<i>.</i>

1003
01:00:08,666 --> 01:00:10,290
Or what? Someone would get hurt?

1004
01:00:10,291 --> 01:00:12,415
All I wanted to do was
learn some people skills.

1005
01:00:12,416 --> 01:00:15,874
-I didn't wanna put a spike in a body.
-So it's my acting? Right.

1006
01:00:15,875 --> 01:00:17,999
'Cause it's really convincing
when you start talking about

1007
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:20,833
-French cocaine!
-Will you both shut the fuck up!

1008
01:00:22,041 --> 01:00:24,082
We need the evidence
on the phone, okay?

1009
01:00:24,083 --> 01:00:27,082
Until then, we... play along.

1010
01:00:27,083 --> 01:00:30,582
-I can't. I can't anymore.
-Well, you've got to.

1011
01:00:30,583 --> 01:00:33,332
You have got to 'cause
they are sniffing for rats

1012
01:00:33,333 --> 01:00:35,582
and if we stop now, we're dead.

1013
01:00:35,583 --> 01:00:39,208
So, someone needs to...

1014
01:00:40,500 --> 01:00:42,082
chop this body up.

1015
01:01:02,958 --> 01:01:05,875
Let's see De Niro do this.

1016
01:01:10,708 --> 01:01:12,124
Yes.

1017
01:01:12,125 --> 01:01:15,457
-Yes, yes, yes, yes.
-Was the printer not working before?

1018
01:01:15,458 --> 01:01:17,957
Officer at the K-Lash
scene confirm a homicide,

1019
01:01:17,958 --> 01:01:20,040
and they found prints
that match those

1020
01:01:20,041 --> 01:01:22,374
at the Iceman's flat,
our trio were there.

1021
01:01:22,375 --> 01:01:26,290
-Forensics coming good for once, huh?
-Our team is world class, man.

1022
01:01:26,291 --> 01:01:28,540
-Oh, really?
-I think just generally stop saying...

1023
01:01:28,541 --> 01:01:30,832
Saying stuff like that.
Yes, I know what you mean.

1024
01:01:30,833 --> 01:01:33,874
In fact, the lab worked overtime and
got us a positive ID on the splatter.

1025
01:01:33,875 --> 01:01:35,499
-Sorry.
-He was one of our own.

1026
01:01:35,500 --> 01:01:37,540
Poor guy is only one year
away from retirement.

1027
01:01:37,541 --> 01:01:39,249
-Always the way.
-You said you'd stop.

1028
01:01:39,250 --> 01:01:40,415
That's the last one.

1029
01:01:40,416 --> 01:01:43,415
These guys killed a police
officer, they are going down.

1030
01:01:43,416 --> 01:01:45,541
Now, we just need to find
these cold-hearted fuckers.

1031
01:01:47,958 --> 01:01:49,958
Oh, finally.

1032
01:01:51,458 --> 01:01:52,708
Which bit next?

1033
01:01:53,916 --> 01:01:55,625
Oh, no.

1034
01:01:56,958 --> 01:01:59,082
Shit.

1035
01:01:59,083 --> 01:02:00,582
Shit, shit.

1036
01:02:02,791 --> 01:02:05,582
-<i>Kat, you're alive.</i>
-Yeah.

1037
01:02:05,583 --> 01:02:07,457
Hey. Hey. Don't call the cops.

1038
01:02:07,458 --> 01:02:09,416
So, you're okay?

1039
01:02:12,666 --> 01:02:13,957
I'm great.

1040
01:02:13,958 --> 01:02:17,124
Is that... sounds like sawing?

1041
01:02:17,125 --> 01:02:20,082
Yeah, just doing
some, um, woodworking.

1042
01:02:20,083 --> 01:02:22,790
Well, tools down, babes,

1043
01:02:22,791 --> 01:02:25,332
'cause me and the girls
wanna make up with you.

1044
01:02:25,333 --> 01:02:27,499
<i>Dinner at mine?</i>

1045
01:02:27,500 --> 01:02:29,207
Yeah, sounds great.

1046
01:02:29,208 --> 01:02:30,957
-Uh...
-Spot of Din Dins?

1047
01:02:30,958 --> 01:02:34,624
I gotta, uh, run some errands.

1048
01:02:34,625 --> 01:02:38,165
Uh, so maybe later? Don't call
the cops is the main thing.

1049
01:02:38,166 --> 01:02:40,165
<i>You shouldn't waste police time.</i>

1050
01:02:40,166 --> 01:02:41,665
Okay, love you.

1051
01:02:41,666 --> 01:02:42,833
-<i>Okay, bye.</i>
-Bye.

1052
01:02:44,625 --> 01:02:45,707
Done.

1053
01:02:45,708 --> 01:02:47,666
Now, how the fuck
can we jack a ride?

1054
01:02:49,166 --> 01:02:51,458
There's one little
trick I've used before.

1055
01:02:53,666 --> 01:02:55,249
I was thinking more of a car,

1056
01:02:55,250 --> 01:02:58,124
-to be honest.
-Is it really jacking if you pay for it?

1057
01:02:58,125 --> 01:03:01,415
Well, I used the company card,
so it still feels a bit naughty.

1058
01:03:01,416 --> 01:03:04,082
Hmm, surveillance
aren't so bad after all.

1059
01:03:04,083 --> 01:03:05,999
That is our guys.

1060
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:08,582
Let's give them a chance
to do this the easy way.

1061
01:03:10,083 --> 01:03:12,582
-Shit.
-Go, go, go!

1062
01:03:12,583 --> 01:03:14,375
Oh, they're doing
it the hard way.

1063
01:03:16,791 --> 01:03:18,832
<i>Stop! It's the police!</i>

1064
01:03:18,833 --> 01:03:20,249
<i>As in you stop!</i>

1065
01:03:20,250 --> 01:03:22,833
<i>We're the police. Obviously
not "stop the police."</i>

1066
01:03:24,125 --> 01:03:25,458
Follow me.

1067
01:03:28,708 --> 01:03:30,249
And we've lost one of them.

1068
01:03:30,250 --> 01:03:32,290
We've got runners.
Hot on their tails.

1069
01:03:32,291 --> 01:03:33,875
-That's not plugged in.
-Fine.

1070
01:03:38,583 --> 01:03:39,583
Fuck.

1071
01:03:42,916 --> 01:03:43,916
Split up.

1072
01:03:45,750 --> 01:03:48,749
All right, you follow the
little guy, I'll take this one.

1073
01:03:48,750 --> 01:03:50,249
Belt. Fucking safety belt.

1074
01:03:50,250 --> 01:03:52,457
Get out, get out, get out.

1075
01:03:52,458 --> 01:03:53,999
Go.

1076
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:55,707
Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit.

1077
01:03:55,708 --> 01:03:57,916
-Come back now.
-Shit, fuck!

1078
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:00,125
Stop, stop cycling.

1079
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:09,624
Go back. Go back.

1080
01:04:09,625 --> 01:04:13,582
Reverse! Reverse! What do you
think the blue lights are?

1081
01:04:13,583 --> 01:04:15,874
You think I'm an ice cream
van? Fucking reverse!

1082
01:04:15,875 --> 01:04:18,290
All right, no, you win.

1083
01:04:18,291 --> 01:04:20,666
You win. Jesus Christ.

1084
01:04:21,708 --> 01:04:23,082
Go on then. Away you go.

1085
01:04:23,083 --> 01:04:25,707
Fill your boots. It's only
a fucking police chase.

1086
01:04:25,708 --> 01:04:26,958
Get back in here.

1087
01:04:29,666 --> 01:04:30,875
I got you now.

1088
01:04:33,750 --> 01:04:34,832
What the fuck?

1089
01:04:34,833 --> 01:04:36,416
Ow, ow, oh.

1090
01:04:39,541 --> 01:04:41,165
-I'm good.
-You okay?

1091
01:04:41,166 --> 01:04:42,415
I'm okay.

1092
01:04:42,416 --> 01:04:44,124
Yup, get out of the way then.

1093
01:04:44,125 --> 01:04:47,041
He went that way. He's
faster than he looks.

1094
01:05:04,833 --> 01:05:06,416
Oh, fuck!

1095
01:05:08,875 --> 01:05:09,958
Sorry!

1096
01:05:14,541 --> 01:05:16,333
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1097
01:05:20,083 --> 01:05:21,125
For fuck's sake!

1098
01:05:29,416 --> 01:05:30,916
Damn, this guy's good.

1099
01:05:59,125 --> 01:06:01,957
Jesus. What happened?

1100
01:06:01,958 --> 01:06:03,957
It's hard to explain.

1101
01:06:03,958 --> 01:06:05,582
You fell in the canal?

1102
01:06:05,583 --> 01:06:07,374
Oh, I guess not that hard.

1103
01:06:07,375 --> 01:06:10,540
So, what now? I mean, we can't
go to the dump spot like this.

1104
01:06:10,541 --> 01:06:13,374
-The fuzz are looking for bikes.
-Hmm.

1105
01:06:13,375 --> 01:06:14,958
I know where we can get a car.

1106
01:06:16,250 --> 01:06:19,082
She's expecting me for
one of her bougie dinners.

1107
01:06:19,083 --> 01:06:20,625
It should almost be over.

1108
01:06:21,625 --> 01:06:22,957
I'm gonna find the keys.

1109
01:06:22,958 --> 01:06:24,832
Stay out of sight.

1110
01:06:24,833 --> 01:06:26,040
You need a wingman.

1111
01:06:26,041 --> 01:06:27,582
Point, wing, nest.

1112
01:06:27,583 --> 01:06:28,999
No.

1113
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:31,458
Stay with the body,
look out for trouble.

1114
01:06:37,333 --> 01:06:39,208
Katty, you came.

1115
01:06:45,291 --> 01:06:46,833
Is it cool I brought a friend?

1116
01:06:47,916 --> 01:06:50,916
Well, we're all friends here.

1117
01:06:53,666 --> 01:06:56,000
You distract them,
I'll get the keys.

1118
01:07:04,875 --> 01:07:06,916
Oh, thank God. I'm starving.

1119
01:07:09,166 --> 01:07:12,124
<i>Has it started? Let us
know when she's here.</i>

1120
01:07:12,125 --> 01:07:13,415
Wait, what?

1121
01:07:13,416 --> 01:07:16,290
-Mom, is that...
-Kat, this isn't an intervention.

1122
01:07:16,291 --> 01:07:17,999
<i>Wendy, I think it's started.</i>

1123
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:21,707
Now, Kat, we're all here because
we really care about you.

1124
01:07:21,708 --> 01:07:23,165
Sorry, who are you?

1125
01:07:23,166 --> 01:07:24,957
This is Lotta.

1126
01:07:24,958 --> 01:07:28,415
She's an award-winning Harley
Street psychotherapist.

1127
01:07:28,416 --> 01:07:30,415
Hi.

1128
01:07:30,416 --> 01:07:32,040
Ooh. Thanks.

1129
01:07:32,041 --> 01:07:34,749
We just had no idea
how bad things had got.

1130
01:07:34,750 --> 01:07:37,540
Nothing's bad.
Everything is fine.

1131
01:07:37,541 --> 01:07:40,957
-Is that blood on your face?
-<i>Oh, Evan.</i>

1132
01:07:40,958 --> 01:07:44,290
<i>-I'll get your inhaler.</i>
-Kat, your drinking is out of control.

1133
01:07:44,291 --> 01:07:48,291
And the company you keep, I mean,
he's clearly stealing something.

1134
01:07:49,333 --> 01:07:50,665
I thought it was mine.

1135
01:07:50,666 --> 01:07:52,374
The brunch was worrying enough,

1136
01:07:52,375 --> 01:07:54,249
and then the next
time we see you...

1137
01:07:54,250 --> 01:07:56,332
You admitted to taking ketamine.

1138
01:07:56,333 --> 01:07:59,665
I know you're trying to give
me the keys to my freedom,

1139
01:07:59,666 --> 01:08:01,540
but look at me.

1140
01:08:01,541 --> 01:08:03,541
Seriously, look at me.

1141
01:08:08,250 --> 01:08:11,832
-I'm an addict.
-Yes. Well done.

1142
01:08:19,041 --> 01:08:21,415
-Oh, no.
-He likes you.

1143
01:08:21,416 --> 01:08:22,957
Nope. Yup. Yeah.

1144
01:08:22,958 --> 01:08:25,207
-I have never seen him like this.
-Mm-hmm.

1145
01:08:25,208 --> 01:08:27,415
-What have you got in those bags?
-It's...

1146
01:08:27,416 --> 01:08:29,540
Nope, just meat.

1147
01:08:29,541 --> 01:08:31,332
That's a lot of meat, innit?

1148
01:08:31,333 --> 01:08:33,124
Yeah, it's a lot of meat.

1149
01:08:33,125 --> 01:08:37,957
Um, I... uh, a
butcher gave it to me.

1150
01:08:37,958 --> 01:08:40,999
I think he was retiring.

1151
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:44,000
Oh, you wouldn't mind chuckin'
him a scrap then, would you?

1152
01:08:45,708 --> 01:08:48,540
I sprained my ankle and
I couldn't quit the meds.

1153
01:08:48,541 --> 01:08:51,749
And so, you know, I got
my hands on whatever.

1154
01:08:51,750 --> 01:08:55,040
Um, codeine, Vicodin.

1155
01:08:55,041 --> 01:08:57,541
Tramadol, Demerol.

1156
01:08:58,666 --> 01:09:02,040
Percocet, whiffle
dust, monkey tranq,

1157
01:09:02,041 --> 01:09:05,582
white girl, all chased
down with cough syrup

1158
01:09:05,583 --> 01:09:07,707
and Uncle Jack, and...

1159
01:09:07,708 --> 01:09:10,415
Ruth, can you come sit by me?

1160
01:09:10,416 --> 01:09:12,457
Of course, darling.

1161
01:09:12,458 --> 01:09:14,124
Uh, I need a hug.

1162
01:09:14,125 --> 01:09:15,332
Oh, sweetheart.

1163
01:09:15,333 --> 01:09:17,415
-Come here.
-I'm so glad. Thank you.

1164
01:09:17,416 --> 01:09:18,874
-Oh.
-Oh.

1165
01:09:18,875 --> 01:09:20,665
Thank you. Thank you.

1166
01:09:20,666 --> 01:09:21,957
I need to save it.

1167
01:09:21,958 --> 01:09:23,207
But you've got loads.

1168
01:09:23,208 --> 01:09:25,332
I know but I've
got a big family.

1169
01:09:25,333 --> 01:09:27,249
Hugh, we've got the keys.

1170
01:09:27,250 --> 01:09:28,582
-Let's go.
-Let it go.

1171
01:09:28,583 --> 01:09:30,582
-Sorry.
-Let's go.

1172
01:09:30,583 --> 01:09:32,957
Oh, it's my Uber.

1173
01:09:32,958 --> 01:09:35,374
-Oh.
-To rehab.

1174
01:09:35,375 --> 01:09:37,874
I called it the second
I saw your faces.

1175
01:09:37,875 --> 01:09:39,999
<i>Finish this, sweetie.</i>

1176
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:41,999
I will, Dad.

1177
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:44,957
-Let's go! Go, go, go, go!
-Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!

1178
01:09:44,958 --> 01:09:46,166
Get in! Get in! Get in!

1179
01:09:49,666 --> 01:09:51,582
-Hugh?
-Yeah, I'm in! I'm in!

1180
01:09:51,583 --> 01:09:52,666
Drive!

1181
01:10:12,166 --> 01:10:13,375
I'm sorry, man.

1182
01:10:14,750 --> 01:10:15,958
Where have you been?

1183
01:10:18,416 --> 01:10:19,915
Let's get to work.

1184
01:10:19,916 --> 01:10:22,957
Ugh, after we bury this body,

1185
01:10:22,958 --> 01:10:25,415
we need to work out how
to get the car back,

1186
01:10:25,416 --> 01:10:26,790
wipe off fingerprints,

1187
01:10:26,791 --> 01:10:28,624
remove any tracking devices,

1188
01:10:28,625 --> 01:10:32,541
and somehow get the keys back
inside the house without ever...

1189
01:10:37,083 --> 01:10:39,416
Or that. That works.

1190
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:42,500
I'll drive you home.

1191
01:10:49,541 --> 01:10:53,125
Cop's phone's at an electrics shop
in Tottenham Hale, getting hacked.

1192
01:10:55,500 --> 01:10:57,499
So, um...

1193
01:10:57,500 --> 01:11:00,540
how long does that
take to hack a phone?

1194
01:11:00,541 --> 01:11:02,207
Not long.

1195
01:11:02,208 --> 01:11:04,333
We'll know who grassed
on us soon enough.

1196
01:11:07,791 --> 01:11:10,374
So, where am I
dropping you guys?

1197
01:11:10,375 --> 01:11:11,625
Uh...

1198
01:11:13,041 --> 01:11:14,250
up here's fine.

1199
01:11:21,500 --> 01:11:22,625
Stay.

1200
01:11:24,250 --> 01:11:26,166
I wanna show you my place.

1201
01:11:28,375 --> 01:11:29,375
Brilliant.

1202
01:11:36,833 --> 01:11:39,457
He's fine. He can handle it.

1203
01:11:39,458 --> 01:11:40,750
You sure?

1204
01:11:42,083 --> 01:11:43,541
Come on. We need that phone.

1205
01:11:50,541 --> 01:11:52,457
We're here for the pig's phone.

1206
01:11:52,458 --> 01:11:54,749
These fucks need
to hand it over.

1207
01:11:54,750 --> 01:11:57,332
-Metcalfe's orders.
-First I've heard.

1208
01:11:57,333 --> 01:12:02,415
How about I call up Metcalfe so you can
explain to him that you're in charge now?

1209
01:12:09,125 --> 01:12:11,583
-Fine.
-<i>Can I take your order?</i>

1210
01:12:12,416 --> 01:12:13,666
Upstairs.

1211
01:12:18,125 --> 01:12:20,000
Ugh.

1212
01:12:21,333 --> 01:12:23,999
That was a fucking day.

1213
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:25,041
Yeah.

1214
01:12:30,791 --> 01:12:32,791
So, do you live here alone then?

1215
01:12:33,958 --> 01:12:35,541
I'm gonna pour us a glass.

1216
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:38,166
Pinot noir?

1217
01:12:39,666 --> 01:12:42,666
Oh, yeah, that would be lovely.

1218
01:12:44,500 --> 01:12:48,082
Um, yeah, do you mind
if I go and freshen up?

1219
01:12:48,083 --> 01:12:50,457
-Sure.
-Okay.

1220
01:12:50,458 --> 01:12:51,957
Gun.

1221
01:12:51,958 --> 01:12:53,083
Just a gun.

1222
01:12:58,750 --> 01:13:00,916
Oh, thank you.

1223
01:13:02,125 --> 01:13:03,416
So...

1224
01:13:05,708 --> 01:13:07,415
what do you like?

1225
01:13:07,416 --> 01:13:10,499
Oh, well, um, close-up
magic obviously.

1226
01:13:10,500 --> 01:13:13,708
Um, any type of smoked
fish, uh, games with maths.

1227
01:13:25,083 --> 01:13:27,125
Save yourselves a lot of bother.

1228
01:13:28,208 --> 01:13:31,708
Last time a worm said no
to me was Afghanistan.

1229
01:13:32,875 --> 01:13:35,165
You fought in Afghanistan?

1230
01:13:35,166 --> 01:13:37,707
How do you think I got this?

1231
01:13:37,708 --> 01:13:39,999
How recently were you there?

1232
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:42,374
Some wounds never heal.

1233
01:13:42,375 --> 01:13:44,415
That should have.

1234
01:13:44,416 --> 01:13:48,499
Not when it was inflicted by the
sickest torturer in Guantanamo.

1235
01:13:48,500 --> 01:13:49,583
Guant...

1236
01:13:52,416 --> 01:13:55,207
So, you were fighting
with the Taliban?

1237
01:13:55,208 --> 01:13:57,874
Beginning to work it out?

1238
01:13:57,875 --> 01:14:00,249
I'm the sickest
motherfucker you ever met.

1239
01:14:00,250 --> 01:14:01,582
<i>Here we go.</i>

1240
01:14:01,583 --> 01:14:05,166
<i>We don't want beans. We
want the Pizza Knight.</i>

1241
01:14:06,416 --> 01:14:09,582
<i>Yay! He's here.</i>

1242
01:14:09,583 --> 01:14:13,457
<i>By royal decree, you have
summoned the Pizza Knight.</i>

1243
01:14:13,458 --> 01:14:16,415
<i>Monday Night Football is
sponsored by the Pizza Knight.</i>

1244
01:14:16,416 --> 01:14:19,457
<i>From frozen to delicious
in only three minutes.</i>

1245
01:14:19,458 --> 01:14:21,374
<i>In the name of the Queen...</i>

1246
01:14:21,375 --> 01:14:22,666
<i>we feast.</i>

1247
01:14:24,083 --> 01:14:27,000
That guy, he looks
just like you.

1248
01:14:28,791 --> 01:14:32,124
That guy looks like a knob.

1249
01:14:32,125 --> 01:14:34,707
Are you saying I
look like a knob?

1250
01:14:34,708 --> 01:14:37,832
I'm saying what I'm saying.

1251
01:14:37,833 --> 01:14:39,915
Then, we have a problem.

1252
01:14:39,916 --> 01:14:40,915
<i>Magnificent.</i>

1253
01:14:40,916 --> 01:14:42,458
You wanna go, big man?

1254
01:14:47,458 --> 01:14:48,458
Oi!

1255
01:14:50,041 --> 01:14:51,874
What you doing up here?

1256
01:14:51,875 --> 01:14:54,624
Oh, I'm a... I, uh,
I work for Metcalfe.

1257
01:14:54,625 --> 01:14:56,915
-You what?
-It's fine. I work for Metcalfe... whoa!

1258
01:14:56,916 --> 01:14:59,707
-Out! Move, bitch, now!
-Excuse me.

1259
01:14:59,708 --> 01:15:02,332
You don't need to
touch me or anything.

1260
01:15:02,333 --> 01:15:03,333
Ah!

1261
01:15:10,250 --> 01:15:12,000

Walked right into it.

1277
01:16:34,125 --> 01:16:36,040
That's what I love
about coppers.

1278
01:16:36,041 --> 01:16:37,291
Thick as shite.

1279
01:16:38,708 --> 01:16:41,916
Oh, you're on a
roll you are, Fly.

1280
01:16:43,833 --> 01:16:46,124
How could I see this coming?

1281
01:16:46,125 --> 01:16:47,707
The Old Bill must have
changed their rules

1282
01:16:47,708 --> 01:16:49,707
'cause this lot have been going
around fucking killing people.

1283
01:16:49,708 --> 01:16:53,957
You vouched for them. They
are your responsibility.

1284
01:16:53,958 --> 01:16:56,457
Why don't you come over tomorrow
night and make a cup of tea for me

1285
01:16:56,458 --> 01:16:58,582
and the Albanians?

1286
01:16:58,583 --> 01:17:00,790
What? The deal's back on?

1287
01:17:00,791 --> 01:17:03,707
I bent to their demands.

1288
01:17:03,708 --> 01:17:05,375
And in the meantime...

1289
01:17:06,791 --> 01:17:08,833
Ratatouille.

1290
01:17:12,333 --> 01:17:14,874
Before my old man died,

1291
01:17:14,875 --> 01:17:18,207
he used to work on
motors in the garage.

1292
01:17:18,208 --> 01:17:21,415
In the winter,
rats would come in.

1293
01:17:21,416 --> 01:17:24,915
They chewed all the wires
in his transmission,

1294
01:17:24,916 --> 01:17:27,790
fucked everything he'd
worked on that summer.

1295
01:17:27,791 --> 01:17:29,333
But he didn't get angry.

1296
01:17:30,750 --> 01:17:32,790
I asked him why. He said,

1297
01:17:32,791 --> 01:17:35,250
"The rats are just doing
what they've got to do."

1298
01:17:37,041 --> 01:17:38,915
And later that night,

1299
01:17:38,916 --> 01:17:42,457
I saw him drowning
rats in a bucket.

1300
01:17:42,458 --> 01:17:46,166
And I said, " I thought
you didn't mind the rats?"

1301
01:17:48,583 --> 01:17:49,583
And he said,

1302
01:17:51,291 --> 01:17:53,291
"I'm just doin'
what I've got to."

1303
01:17:57,291 --> 01:17:58,583
You understand?

1304
01:18:06,708 --> 01:18:07,708
Oh, God.

1305
01:18:09,333 --> 01:18:11,707
Oh, fuck, guys.

1306
01:18:11,708 --> 01:18:13,290
I'm...

1307
01:18:13,291 --> 01:18:14,541
It's okay.

1308
01:18:15,541 --> 01:18:17,375
I pushed you into it.

1309
01:18:18,416 --> 01:18:21,207
We're all gonna die because
I needed to prove to myself

1310
01:18:21,208 --> 01:18:24,999
that I hadn't thrown my life
away. How fucking stupid is that<i>?</i>

1311
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:28,749
No, you might have pulled
this off if it wasn't for me.

1312
01:18:28,750 --> 01:18:30,541
Going too far all the time.

1313
01:18:32,291 --> 01:18:36,207
I'm no De Niro.

1314
01:18:36,208 --> 01:18:40,166
I'm no Brando. My name's not
even Marlon, it's Tristan.

1315
01:18:42,083 --> 01:18:43,833
My dad's a dentist.

1316
01:18:45,583 --> 01:18:47,416
And I played regional cricket.

1317
01:18:50,291 --> 01:18:51,750
I'm the Pizza Knight.

1318
01:18:53,416 --> 01:18:55,208
Well, now that's
all I'll ever be.

1319
01:18:56,458 --> 01:18:59,332
I've just been generally shit.

1320
01:18:59,333 --> 01:19:02,707
Literally, I have no
idea what I'm doing.

1321
01:19:02,708 --> 01:19:05,499
All in a pathetic
attempt to make friends.

1322
01:19:05,500 --> 01:19:08,833
I should've just been myself.
I should've worked in wine.

1323
01:19:18,583 --> 01:19:19,583
Rat!

1324
01:19:23,333 --> 01:19:25,040
Get up!

1325
01:19:25,041 --> 01:19:26,041
Up!

1326
01:19:27,208 --> 01:19:28,208
Over there.

1327
01:20:06,083 --> 01:20:09,916
The Squire needed two.

1328
01:20:12,541 --> 01:20:15,332
I don't blame you, trying
to bring Metcalfe down.

1329
01:20:15,333 --> 01:20:17,124
The man's an animal.

1330
01:20:17,125 --> 01:20:20,000
I might be a crook,
but I'm not villain.

1331
01:20:21,083 --> 01:20:24,375
And I'm not gonna put another three
bodies in the ground for no good reason.

1332
01:20:30,708 --> 01:20:35,124
You know, I knew there was
something up with you lot.

1333
01:20:35,125 --> 01:20:38,000
For one thing, I liked you.

1334
01:20:41,750 --> 01:20:44,332
Now, you get going. Long gone.

1335
01:20:44,333 --> 01:20:47,332
You show your faces around here
again, we're all fucking dead.

1336
01:20:47,333 --> 01:20:49,207
All right?

1337
01:20:49,208 --> 01:20:51,374
Gone. Now.

1338
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:03,915
Okay. So, I found an 11:30
from Gatwick to Costa Rica.

1339
01:21:03,916 --> 01:21:05,499
Do we really have to leave?

1340
01:21:05,500 --> 01:21:08,082
You wanna spend the rest of your
life looking over your shoulder?

1341
01:21:08,083 --> 01:21:11,915
But it's Costa Rica, we can't
just... can't we go to Devon?

1342
01:21:11,916 --> 01:21:14,707
This is our opportunity,
Hugh, for a fresh start.

1343
01:21:14,708 --> 01:21:17,208
To do whatever we want,
to go wherever we want.

1344
01:21:18,500 --> 01:21:22,125
So, you mean we'd
have to say goodbye?

1345
01:21:28,458 --> 01:21:33,000
Hey, Hugh. What matters most
is that we're alive, right?

1346
01:21:34,875 --> 01:21:36,957
We're safe now.

1347
01:21:36,958 --> 01:21:40,332
Down on your knees.
Down on your knees.

1348
01:21:40,333 --> 01:21:42,582
Stay where you are.

1349
01:21:42,583 --> 01:21:43,875
Cuff these bastards.

1350
01:21:52,625 --> 01:21:54,249
Remember this moment.

1351
01:21:54,250 --> 01:21:57,665
This is what it feels like
to take down the big guys.

1352
01:21:57,666 --> 01:22:00,165
"Improv comic destroys heckler."

1353
01:22:00,166 --> 01:22:01,665
Do you believe us now?

1354
01:22:01,666 --> 01:22:02,957
We're not criminals.

1355
01:22:02,958 --> 01:22:05,000
Okay. Found it. Here we go.

1356
01:22:09,333 --> 01:22:11,999
Um, if you're on YouTube, it's less of
a claim to fame, but I actually asked...

1357
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:14,165
-Yeah. So, can you turn off...
-Yes, sorry. Yes, I will do.

1358
01:22:14,166 --> 01:22:15,874
If you're on YouTube, I
actually asked a question

1359
01:22:15,875 --> 01:22:18,415
at the 2015 Leicester
Security Conference.

1360
01:22:18,416 --> 01:22:20,207
Oh, fuck's sake.

1361
01:22:20,208 --> 01:22:22,749
Billings realized we were
his ticket to a payday.

1362
01:22:22,750 --> 01:22:24,957
That's why there's no
evidence in your system.

1363
01:22:24,958 --> 01:22:27,665
The thing about there being no
evidence being your evidence,

1364
01:22:27,666 --> 01:22:30,665
is that there's no evidence.

1365
01:22:30,666 --> 01:22:33,374
Whereas I do have
you on car theft,

1366
01:22:33,375 --> 01:22:36,124
drug trafficking,
manslaughter, dismemberment.

1367
01:22:36,125 --> 01:22:38,249
We've even got a guy who
says you upset his dog.

1368
01:22:38,250 --> 01:22:40,957
-I was under duress.
-Duress or no, you did it.

1369
01:22:40,958 --> 01:22:44,416
-I could charge you all right now.
-Go on then, big man.

1370
01:22:47,083 --> 01:22:48,083
What?

1371
01:22:49,750 --> 01:22:53,208
He told our bosses that we're about
to bring in three major players.

1372
01:22:54,541 --> 01:22:55,707
Not a bunch of clowns.

1373
01:22:55,708 --> 01:22:58,374
-Clowning is an art.
-Okay.

1374
01:22:58,375 --> 01:22:59,707
Here's what we're gonna do.

1375
01:22:59,708 --> 01:23:02,290
-I'm gonna give you one chance.
-Yes.

1376
01:23:02,291 --> 01:23:05,207
-You don't know what the plan is.
-Carry on.

1377
01:23:05,208 --> 01:23:09,124
Blend back in with Fly's crew and go
to the exchange tonight wearing a wire.

1378
01:23:09,125 --> 01:23:11,749
Get Metcalfe on tape
confirming his deal

1379
01:23:11,750 --> 01:23:15,665
with the Albanians, and maybe
we can talk about immunity.

1380
01:23:15,666 --> 01:23:16,666
We can't.

1381
01:23:17,583 --> 01:23:21,915
Our cover's blown. Metcalfe
told Fly to whack us.

1382
01:23:21,916 --> 01:23:25,375
Then, it looks like this is
the end of the road for you.

1383
01:23:27,416 --> 01:23:28,416
No.

1384
01:23:29,791 --> 01:23:31,583
We can still get
the deal on tape.

1385
01:23:33,208 --> 01:23:34,208
How?

1386
01:23:35,458 --> 01:23:37,374
<i>Fly is looking for a way out.</i>

1387
01:23:37,375 --> 01:23:40,540
<i>He's tired of killing,
tired of the game.</i>

1388
01:23:40,541 --> 01:23:43,665
<i>Right now, he thinks
we're undercover cops.</i>

1389
01:23:43,666 --> 01:23:45,957
<i>Who are we to tell
him any different?</i>

1390
01:23:45,958 --> 01:23:48,958
<i>First rule of improv,
always say yes.</i>

1391
01:23:53,375 --> 01:23:55,165
We just need to talk.

1392
01:23:55,166 --> 01:23:57,415
Okay. So, here's the deal.

1393
01:23:57,416 --> 01:23:59,624
You record Metcalfe
confirming the terms,

1394
01:23:59,625 --> 01:24:01,165
and we'll take him down,

1395
01:24:01,166 --> 01:24:03,750
the Albanians, all of them.

1396
01:24:05,208 --> 01:24:07,124
It's hard to catch
it on the wire.

1397
01:24:07,125 --> 01:24:09,499
Ain't a lot of chat
goes down at a handover.

1398
01:24:09,500 --> 01:24:11,374
Okay.

1399
01:24:11,375 --> 01:24:13,665
Make it happen and
we let you disappear.

1400
01:24:13,666 --> 01:24:15,250
Go be with your daughter.

1401
01:24:19,458 --> 01:24:21,375
Turn rat for the rats, eh?

1402
01:24:34,875 --> 01:24:37,290
Ah, the "stakeout."

1403
01:24:37,291 --> 01:24:38,958
A tale as old as time.

1404
01:24:42,208 --> 01:24:43,374
Nice costumes.

1405
01:24:43,375 --> 01:24:44,458
Fly's set?

1406
01:24:46,250 --> 01:24:49,999
Okay. That's our
Albanian friends

1407
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:52,624
and Metcalfe's crew.

1408
01:24:52,625 --> 01:24:54,540
Fly is right there with them.

1409
01:24:54,541 --> 01:24:56,165
What if they frisk him?

1410
01:24:56,166 --> 01:24:58,749
All units be advised,
our players have arrived.

1411
01:24:58,750 --> 01:25:00,915
Await my call,
repeat, await my call.

1412
01:25:00,916 --> 01:25:04,290
<i>I'm so glad we could carry
on with our arrangement.</i>

1413
01:25:04,291 --> 01:25:06,749
<i>-Eh, money is money.
-So, a taste?</i>

1414
01:25:06,750 --> 01:25:08,665
<i>H</i> ow <i>much of this are
you fucking buying?</i>

1415
01:25:08,666 --> 01:25:11,332
<i>That's my business. Let's
just get on with it.</i>

1416
01:25:11,333 --> 01:25:12,916
All units standby.

1417
01:25:16,625 --> 01:25:19,207
-Yeah, it's pure.
-Mm-hmm. Okay.

1418
01:25:19,208 --> 01:25:20,916
<i>What about the other
part of our deal?</i>

1419
01:25:22,875 --> 01:25:24,540
<i>Oh, he's all yours.</i>

1420
01:25:24,541 --> 01:25:26,415
<i>-Sorry, Fly.</i>
-Shit.

1421
01:25:26,416 --> 01:25:29,416
<i>Became too expensive
to keep you.</i>

1422
01:25:31,791 --> 01:25:32,791
No.

1423
01:25:35,833 --> 01:25:37,040
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1424
01:25:37,041 --> 01:25:38,540
-Shit.
-Send your guys in.

1425
01:25:38,541 --> 01:25:40,124
-Not until the exchange.
-They're gonna kill him.

1426
01:25:40,125 --> 01:25:41,124
Yeah. Well, unless
they exchange,

1427
01:25:41,125 --> 01:25:42,499
I've got fuck all and I'm not
about to blow this operation.

1428
01:25:42,500 --> 01:25:43,499
We can't let him die.
He saved our lives.

1429
01:25:43,500 --> 01:25:44,665
Not until we have it on tape.

1430
01:25:44,666 --> 01:25:46,540
-Don't we need him alive?
-No, the tape's enough.

1431
01:25:46,541 --> 01:25:48,124
But not even as like...
as like a witness?

1432
01:25:48,125 --> 01:25:49,245
Well, we've got these three.

1433
01:25:52,291 --> 01:25:54,165
-What are we doing?
-Improvising.

1434
01:25:54,166 --> 01:25:56,749
-What the fuck are they doing?
-Oh, my God.

1435
01:25:59,500 --> 01:26:01,291
Could've let me
go out on my feet.

1436
01:26:04,958 --> 01:26:08,957
Nobody move! Nobody
fucking move!

1437
01:26:08,958 --> 01:26:11,040
Police! Freeze!

1438
01:26:11,041 --> 01:26:14,124
Lower you weapons! Please!

1439
01:26:14,125 --> 01:26:15,499
What... how do they
got these guns?

1440
01:26:15,500 --> 01:26:16,875
They're fake guns.

1441
01:26:19,958 --> 01:26:21,332
You let them go.

1442
01:26:21,333 --> 01:26:22,832
Why wouldn't he?

1443
01:26:22,833 --> 01:26:24,458
We pay better.

1444
01:26:27,041 --> 01:26:29,040
Do it! I beg you.

1445
01:26:29,041 --> 01:26:30,540
Cheeky fucker's got two guns.

1446
01:26:30,541 --> 01:26:33,290
I will end you right
here, right now.

1447
01:26:33,291 --> 01:26:35,582
Stand down, Sergeant Petrides.

1448
01:26:35,583 --> 01:26:39,040
Inspector, why put me through sharpshooter
training if you never let me...

1449
01:26:39,041 --> 01:26:41,665
'Cause I don't want a
repeat of the Dutch Embassy!

1450
01:26:41,666 --> 01:26:43,874
This is bullshit, McClary.

1451
01:26:43,875 --> 01:26:47,790
Then you, wee man.

1452
01:26:47,791 --> 01:26:50,875
You're very quiet and you
look like you're gonna puke.

1453
01:26:56,166 --> 01:27:00,790
Yeah. 'Cause I'm imagining the slop
they're gonna feed you in the clink,

1454
01:27:00,791 --> 01:27:02,041
you piece of shit.

1455
01:27:03,458 --> 01:27:08,249
In fact, wee man, I'm
your only way out of here.

1456
01:27:08,250 --> 01:27:11,290
Now I don't care what you
small fry are up to tonight.

1457
01:27:11,291 --> 01:27:14,082
You throw us a sweetener from both
ends and I'll turn a blind eye.

1458
01:27:14,083 --> 01:27:17,790
But that guy, he's our star
witness for much bigger players.

1459
01:27:17,791 --> 01:27:19,125
So he's coming with us.

1460
01:27:20,416 --> 01:27:24,832
Why don't I just
have him shoot you?

1461
01:27:24,833 --> 01:27:28,040
Because I wouldn't be able
to stand down the snipers

1462
01:27:28,041 --> 01:27:30,707
ogling all of your
fucking ugly foreheads!

1463
01:27:35,291 --> 01:27:37,415
-Snipe... he just said snipers.
-I'm aware he just said snipers.

1464
01:27:37,416 --> 01:27:40,216
-Have we got snipers out there?
-No, we've not got snipers out there.

1465
01:27:50,416 --> 01:27:52,624
Jesus Christ, this
might actually work.

1466
01:27:52,625 --> 01:27:55,457
They haven't confirmed it. He
hasn't actually said it yet.

1467
01:27:55,458 --> 01:27:59,374
Hey, out of curiosity, what
do we got here, 50 kilos,

1468
01:27:59,375 --> 01:28:01,415
five million quid?

1469
01:28:01,416 --> 01:28:03,957
Are you a fucking amateur?

1470
01:28:03,958 --> 01:28:06,999
This is half a ton
for ten million.

1471
01:28:07,000 --> 01:28:08,915
-We got him. All units go. All units go.
-Woo.

1472
01:28:08,916 --> 01:28:10,458
-Yes!
-Go, go, go, go, go!

1473
01:28:13,083 --> 01:28:16,540
Why am I thinking
more and more that

1474
01:28:16,541 --> 01:28:21,083
they're just making this
up as they go along, eh?

1475
01:28:26,208 --> 01:28:27,791
If things go sideways.

1476
01:28:29,625 --> 01:28:30,666
The fuck?

1477
01:29:30,208 --> 01:29:31,665
I can't believe that worked.

1478
01:29:31,666 --> 01:29:33,874
You think I was too rude?

1479
01:29:33,875 --> 01:29:36,082
What? That wasn't
part of the plan.

1480
01:29:47,708 --> 01:29:52,500
Ah, Fly, pull the wrong piece,
it all comes tumbling down.

1481
01:29:54,916 --> 01:29:56,958
I always knew you'd...

1482
01:30:08,500 --> 01:30:11,999
Fly, I'm sorry. Fuck,
I had no choice.

1483
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:13,083
It's all right.

1484
01:30:17,041 --> 01:30:20,375
I'd have turned on you
too. Well, I did, didn't I?

1485
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:25,957
We got him immunity but I
think you're on your own.

1486
01:30:25,958 --> 01:30:28,333
You should go,
Shosh. You should go.

1487
01:30:36,125 --> 01:30:37,125
Wait.

1488
01:30:46,666 --> 01:30:48,915
So long, Squire.

1489
01:31:00,125 --> 01:31:01,916
In another life, brother.

1490
01:31:03,166 --> 01:31:05,500
We did... we did actually
kiss. It was... it was...

1491
01:31:09,083 --> 01:31:10,083
Hey.

1492
01:31:12,416 --> 01:31:15,457
So what kind of police
carry fake guns?

1493
01:31:15,458 --> 01:31:16,541
Uh...

1494
01:31:19,625 --> 01:31:21,665
fake police.

1495
01:31:23,958 --> 01:31:26,791
I knew there was something
double fucked about you lot.

1496
01:31:28,041 --> 01:31:31,791
So come on then,
who are you, really?

1497
01:31:37,208 --> 01:31:39,416
We're improv comedians.

1498
01:31:42,666 --> 01:31:44,291
Well, that's fucking weird.

1499
01:31:45,875 --> 01:31:47,332
It's mad actually.

1500
01:31:47,333 --> 01:31:48,665
I'm more of an actor.

1501
01:31:48,666 --> 01:31:51,500
Fucking actors, eh?

1502
01:31:54,125 --> 01:31:55,250
Here.

1503
01:31:56,791 --> 01:31:58,749
You're gonna need this.

1504
01:31:58,750 --> 01:32:01,458
Fuck.

1505
01:32:02,583 --> 01:32:03,665
Are you good?

1506
01:32:03,666 --> 01:32:04,833
Yes.

1507
01:32:07,125 --> 01:32:10,207
<i>Congratulations. Fly touches
down in Portugal this afternoon,</i>

1508
01:32:10,208 --> 01:32:13,457
<i>and the heads of London's two
major criminal organizations</i>

1509
01:32:13,458 --> 01:32:15,332
<i>have been well
and truly severed.</i>

1510
01:32:15,333 --> 01:32:18,249
But like a Hydra, a
head will regrow...

1511
01:32:18,250 --> 01:32:20,290
-I said no to the Hydra...
-It seemed like you were setting it up.

1512
01:32:20,291 --> 01:32:21,749
-Just leave it.
-Fine.

1513
01:32:21,750 --> 01:32:24,124
Did anyone get away or...?

1514
01:32:24,125 --> 01:32:25,915
Shosh, uh, slipped the net.

1515
01:32:25,916 --> 01:32:27,332
Oh, good.

1516
01:32:27,333 --> 01:32:31,040
Good that you got everyone else.

1517
01:32:31,041 --> 01:32:32,874
That's good, isn't it?

1518
01:32:32,875 --> 01:32:36,124
So, uh, cheers basically.
This shit got us promoted.

1519
01:32:36,125 --> 01:32:38,082
You're now speaking with
Superintendent Dawes.

1520
01:32:38,083 --> 01:32:42,249
And Detective Inspector Beverly.

1521
01:32:42,250 --> 01:32:44,707
I mean, we didn't really
know your ranks before, so...

1522
01:32:44,708 --> 01:32:45,749
These are higher.

1523
01:32:45,750 --> 01:32:47,874
So how do you keep us safe?
Do we get new identities?

1524
01:32:47,875 --> 01:32:51,707
Well, the challenge is to make
sure that no one knows who you are.

1525
01:32:51,708 --> 01:32:56,541
So in this case, just, yeah, go
back to what you were doing before.

1526
01:32:59,458 --> 01:33:03,415
So this is Marlon reading for
our biker gang leader, Duke.

1527
01:33:03,416 --> 01:33:06,249
Nice idea but do you
mind losing the scar?

1528
01:33:06,250 --> 01:33:07,541
If only I could.

1529
01:33:09,375 --> 01:33:13,165
So I just turned to my boss
and said, "Uh, fuck off."

1530
01:33:15,250 --> 01:33:17,874
Well, now, I'm my own boss.

1531
01:33:17,875 --> 01:33:23,541
He said, "Those rats are just
doing what they've got to do."

1532
01:33:24,666 --> 01:33:29,290
Later that night, I saw him
drowning rats in a bucket.

1533
01:33:29,291 --> 01:33:31,291
I said, "I thought you
didn't mind the rats?"

1534
01:33:32,500 --> 01:33:34,300
He said, "I'm just doin'
what I've got to do."

1535
01:33:36,458 --> 01:33:39,333
Call Francis, tell
him we found our Duke.

1536
01:33:52,500 --> 01:33:54,499
Is it true, the
undercover mission?

1537
01:33:54,500 --> 01:33:57,041
Everybody's talking about
it. You're kind of a legend.

1538
01:33:58,833 --> 01:34:02,999
Okay. I'm Kat, I'm your teacher.

1539
01:34:03,000 --> 01:34:05,874
Let's just jump right in.
Okay. You two, get up here.

1540
01:34:05,875 --> 01:34:07,249
Woohoo!

1541
01:34:07,250 --> 01:34:09,665
When I clap my hands,
the scene begins.

1542
01:34:09,666 --> 01:34:12,249
Don't overthink it,
just stay in the moment.

1543
01:34:12,250 --> 01:34:16,790
And remember, always,
always trust your partner.

1544
01:34:16,791 --> 01:34:19,333
-Yes?
-Yes.

1545
01:34:20,916 --> 01:34:22,458
And...

1546
01:34:35,208 --> 01:34:39,500
