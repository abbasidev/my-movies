00:05:26,538 --> 00:05:29,768
<i>And by the way,
honey, with all this decolletage</i>

3
00:05:29,849 --> 00:05:33,203
<i>you should be getting a lot more
dickoletage than what he has to offer.</i>

4
00:05:33,238 --> 00:05:35,027
<i>And as I can recall it,</i>

5
00:05:35,062 --> 00:05:36,913
<i>you were the one that
told me that when he came,</i>

6
00:05:36,937 --> 00:05:38,876
<i>it was as thin as coconut water.</i>

7
00:05:38,911 --> 00:05:40,580
<i>Honey, that's a deal breaker for me.</i>

8
00:05:40,629 --> 00:05:41,712
<i>It was that thin.</i>

9
00:05:41,736 --> 00:05:44,180
<i>Well, I see we're
settling for less nowadays.</i>

10
00:05:47,553 --> 00:05:48,988
That's beyond.

11
00:05:53,785 --> 00:05:55,741
Mrs. Morrow,
a package arrived for you.

12
00:05:55,765 --> 00:05:57,698
I found it in the mailbox this morning.

13
00:05:57,771 --> 00:06:00,563
May I ask you who you'd
like on duty this weekend?

14
00:06:00,598 --> 00:06:03,501
Um, actually, why don't you
give everybody the weekend off?

15
00:06:03,564 --> 00:06:04,676
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, yeah.

16
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:06,669
We might go to the beach house and, uh,

17
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:08,971
if not, it might be nice
to have a weekend alone.

18
00:06:09,527 --> 00:06:11,567
- I'll let everyone know.
- Thank you.

19
00:06:15,787 --> 00:06:17,208
Oh, damn it.

20
00:06:18,109 --> 00:06:19,332
- Christopher?
- Yes?

21
00:06:19,356 --> 00:06:22,053
I'm sorry. Can you help me open
this? I just got a paper cut.

22
00:06:22,113 --> 00:06:24,417
- Yeah, of course. Here, let me do it.
- Thank you.

23
00:06:24,688 --> 00:06:27,091
Yeah, yeah. I just... A paper cut.

24
00:06:32,030 --> 00:06:34,458
- There's a note.
- You can read it.

25
00:06:35,469 --> 00:06:36,400
_

26
00:06:36,435 --> 00:06:39,040
"Dear Susan, I've written a novel
that will be published in the spring.

27
00:06:39,064 --> 00:06:40,663
"It's different from the kind
of things that I was writing

28
00:06:40,687 --> 00:06:42,273
"when we were together."

29
00:06:44,834 --> 00:06:45,834
Go ahead.

30
00:06:46,798 --> 00:06:48,423
"In the end you left me with
the inspiration that I needed

31
00:06:48,447 --> 00:06:49,830
"to write from the heart.

32
00:06:49,894 --> 00:06:52,798
"I wanted you to be the first to
read it, so I'm sending along a proof.

33
00:06:52,852 --> 00:06:54,572
"I will be in LA until
Wednesday on business

34
00:06:54,611 --> 00:06:56,870
"and it would be good
to see you after so long.

35
00:06:56,950 --> 00:06:59,931
"My cell number and email
address are below. Edward."

36
00:07:02,152 --> 00:07:03,152
Thanks.

37
00:07:14,792 --> 00:07:16,565
- Morning.
- Good morning.

38
00:07:17,910 --> 00:07:21,039
- What's that?
- It's a manuscript Edward sent me.

39
00:07:21,093 --> 00:07:22,445
He wrote a novel.

40
00:07:23,082 --> 00:07:24,310
Edward who?

41
00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:27,444
Edward, my first husband. You remember him.

42
00:07:27,518 --> 00:07:29,310
I didn't know he could write.

43
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:31,842
Yes, you did. He was writing a
novel when you and I got together.

44
00:07:31,866 --> 00:07:33,401
You just don't remember.

45
00:07:33,645 --> 00:07:35,812
Have you guys even talked in 20 years?

46
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:37,833
19.

47
00:07:38,361 --> 00:07:42,879
No. I tried calling him a couple
of years back, but he hung up on me.

48
00:07:43,294 --> 00:07:46,398
I think he's teaching English
at some prep school in Dallas.

49
00:07:46,511 --> 00:07:48,400
It's sad, really. He never remarried.

50
00:07:49,828 --> 00:07:52,385
Where were you last night?
You didn't come by the gallery.

51
00:07:54,845 --> 00:07:56,581
I'm sorry. Really, I...

52
00:07:56,616 --> 00:07:58,604
By the time I left the office,
I was late for my dinner and...

53
00:07:58,628 --> 00:08:00,997
It would have taken you 15 minutes.

54
00:08:01,083 --> 00:08:03,219
Fifteen minutes, and it
would have meant a lot to me.

55
00:08:04,657 --> 00:08:05,994
Never mind.

56
00:08:07,790 --> 00:08:10,527
- You didn't come to bed last night.
- I didn't wanna wake you.

57
00:08:11,594 --> 00:08:12,642
Yeah.

58
00:08:13,724 --> 00:08:18,639
Well, I wasn't asleep. I was
too wound up from the opening.

59
00:08:19,741 --> 00:08:22,559
It went well, by the way. Apparently.

60
00:08:22,885 --> 00:08:24,355
- Good.
- Yeah.

61
00:08:27,444 --> 00:08:30,547
Look, why don't you and I go to the beach?

62
00:08:30,904 --> 00:08:33,784
We can go tonight and come back on Monday.

63
00:08:34,957 --> 00:08:37,894
Maybe if we just spent some
time, just the two of us?

64
00:08:43,405 --> 00:08:46,307
Why are you wearing this
blazer on a Saturday?

65
00:08:47,314 --> 00:08:49,621
Because I gotta go back to the office,

66
00:08:49,669 --> 00:08:53,072
and then I gotta go to the airport,
and then I gotta go back to New York.

67
00:08:53,107 --> 00:08:55,545
- You just came from there.
- Yes, I know.

68
00:08:55,580 --> 00:08:58,515
But I have to go again if
I wanna get this deal done,

69
00:08:58,550 --> 00:09:00,670
and I don't wanna have
to sell anything else.

70
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:02,586
- Shit.
- It's okay.

71
00:09:06,290 --> 00:09:08,552
You know, the strange thing is is,

72
00:09:08,818 --> 00:09:11,066
I don't really care about all this art.

73
00:09:13,288 --> 00:09:16,626
- That doesn't sound like you.
- I know, but it's true.

74
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:19,472
I care.

75
00:09:20,330 --> 00:09:21,865
It pisses me off.

76
00:09:23,207 --> 00:09:24,587
I know you do.

77
00:09:25,550 --> 00:09:28,365
Don't worry, I can fill the
walls with some new LA artists

78
00:09:28,430 --> 00:09:31,986
and people will think we're ahead
of the curve instead of going broke.

79
00:09:32,048 --> 00:09:33,657
You won't have to be embarrassed.

80
00:09:48,744 --> 00:09:50,151
Are things a little better?

81
00:09:50,209 --> 00:09:52,700
He's just having a hard time
with his business right now.

82
00:09:52,757 --> 00:09:54,580
Carlos told me.

83
00:09:54,690 --> 00:09:57,376
I'm surprised. I thought we
were hiding it pretty well.

84
00:09:58,095 --> 00:10:00,221
Hutton would be very upset
to find out anybody knew.

85
00:10:00,276 --> 00:10:02,811
He just hates not to win.

86
00:10:02,892 --> 00:10:04,280
Are you sleeping?

87
00:10:05,382 --> 00:10:07,945
Did you call my psychopharmacologist?
Did you call him?

88
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:10,034
You should call him, because he's a genius.

89
00:10:10,876 --> 00:10:13,057
I'm worried about you, seriously.

90
00:10:13,150 --> 00:10:15,339
Just look at me for a second. Look at me.

91
00:10:17,333 --> 00:10:19,961
You scared me the last time we talked.

92
00:10:20,036 --> 00:10:21,466
I'm fine.

93
00:10:21,550 --> 00:10:24,267
I am fine. I am...

94
00:10:24,533 --> 00:10:28,225
I am. I just can't believe that
I told you all of those things.

95
00:10:28,305 --> 00:10:31,262
I'm just kind of embarrassed, you know.

96
00:10:31,493 --> 00:10:35,397
Because what right do I have to
not be happy? I have everything.

97
00:10:35,670 --> 00:10:38,101
I feel ungrateful not to be happy.

98
00:10:38,187 --> 00:10:40,292
As much right as anyone,
Susan, as much right as anyone,

99
00:10:40,316 --> 00:10:42,052
because it's all relative.

100
00:10:45,382 --> 00:10:49,520
You're just awfully hard on yourself.

101
00:10:50,678 --> 00:10:51,893
How do you do it?

102
00:10:53,439 --> 00:10:56,802
You mean with Carlos? I just...
It's... I'm totally cool with it.

103
00:10:56,873 --> 00:11:00,595
And having a gay husband is
not such a bad thing, you know?

104
00:11:02,867 --> 00:11:06,663
We're best friends. We
love each other completely.

105
00:11:06,698 --> 00:11:08,936
I'm certainly the only woman in his life.

106
00:11:09,002 --> 00:11:12,012
And that lasts longer
than lust, doesn't it?

107
00:11:12,066 --> 00:11:13,756
It's forever, really.

108
00:11:14,637 --> 00:11:16,388
Hutton and I don't have that.

109
00:11:16,439 --> 00:11:17,864
Did you ever?

110
00:11:18,794 --> 00:11:21,824
I think we just want different
things, or I want different things.

111
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:25,866
Do you still love him?

112
00:11:30,368 --> 00:11:32,080
I'm being summoned. Pardon me.

113
00:11:32,129 --> 00:11:34,103
He has to catch a plane.
I'm gonna say goodbye.

114
00:11:40,753 --> 00:11:42,780
I hope this deal works out for you.

115
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:46,147
- I really do. I know you need it.
- We need this.

116
00:11:46,369 --> 00:11:48,768
No. You need this.

117
00:11:53,277 --> 00:11:54,478
- Bye.
- Bye.

118
00:12:04,228 --> 00:12:05,054
<i>So I said,</i>

119
00:12:05,089 --> 00:12:07,099
"Well, my mother always told me

120
00:12:07,157 --> 00:12:10,221
"if you massage your pussy
with Pam cooking spray

121
00:12:10,267 --> 00:12:11,836
"a month before the baby comes,

122
00:12:11,871 --> 00:12:13,846
"you don't need vaginal rejuvenation."

123
00:12:15,765 --> 00:12:17,501
I've gotta get some Pam.

124
00:12:19,066 --> 00:12:21,631
And she is going to get
a nomination this year.

125
00:12:21,672 --> 00:12:23,692
A nomination? She's gonna win.

126
00:12:25,809 --> 00:12:28,097
Let's talk about your opening.

127
00:12:28,203 --> 00:12:31,463
- My favorite subject.
- Not mine.

128
00:12:31,552 --> 00:12:35,552
The opening was spectacular last night.

129
00:12:35,587 --> 00:12:37,348
Really? That's what you thought?

130
00:12:37,422 --> 00:12:39,048
- What, you didn't?
- No.

131
00:12:39,109 --> 00:12:41,530
I thought the work was incredibly strong.

132
00:12:41,622 --> 00:12:45,563
So perfect with all this
junk culture that we live in.

133
00:12:45,595 --> 00:12:48,431
It's junk. It is junk.

134
00:12:48,523 --> 00:12:51,101
Total junk.

135
00:12:51,134 --> 00:12:55,374
Darling, you are a big success.

136
00:12:55,484 --> 00:13:00,396
- No one really likes what they do.
- Then why do we do it?

137
00:13:00,431 --> 00:13:01,905
Because we're driven.

138
00:13:03,412 --> 00:13:05,181
Maybe a bit insecure.

139
00:13:06,816 --> 00:13:09,672
We get into things when we're young

140
00:13:09,725 --> 00:13:12,906
and because we think they mean something.

141
00:13:12,963 --> 00:13:14,948
And then we find
out that they don't.

142
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:22,505
Oh, Susan, enjoy the
absurdity of our world.

143
00:13:22,666 --> 00:13:24,470
It's a lot less painful.

144
00:13:24,927 --> 00:13:30,628
And believe me, our world is a lot
less painful than the real world.

145
00:14:00,495 --> 00:14:01,882
_

146
00:14:22,445 --> 00:14:25,074
Yeah, why are we driving
this old thing to Marfa?

147
00:14:25,149 --> 00:14:28,455
Because I just had it completely
rebuilt. It's a classic.

148
00:14:28,531 --> 00:14:30,609
It has a terrible sound system.

149
00:14:30,673 --> 00:14:32,672
Well, you're gonna have
to suffer through that.

150
00:14:32,788 --> 00:14:34,631
You have two sets of boots, India?

151
00:14:34,691 --> 00:14:37,622
Do we really have to stop
tonight? I'd rather just get there.

152
00:14:37,761 --> 00:14:39,861
All right, ask your mother. She's the boss.

153
00:14:43,086 --> 00:14:44,607
I set the alarm.

154
00:15:02,205 --> 00:15:04,726
India, you've been on that thing for hours.

155
00:15:08,158 --> 00:15:10,341
I thought you were the one
who wanted to drive all night.

156
00:15:10,365 --> 00:15:14,824
I did, but what are we supposed to
do, sing campfire songs or something?

157
00:15:21,923 --> 00:15:23,834
- How much longer?
- I don't know.

158
00:15:25,581 --> 00:15:28,338
Like three, three and a half hours.

159
00:15:28,968 --> 00:15:30,652
Well, Dad, you're
gonna get your wish.

160
00:15:30,676 --> 00:15:32,595
My cell service just went out.

161
00:15:32,762 --> 00:15:35,027
Jesus, can you believe
there's no service here?

162
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:36,733
How is that even possible?

163
00:15:36,826 --> 00:15:39,266
Two of the things I
love most about west Texas,

164
00:15:39,328 --> 00:15:41,198
no phones and no people.

165
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:53,092
Oh, come on.

166
00:17:21,396 --> 00:17:23,705
- Total jerks.
- Are we rid of them?

167
00:17:24,408 --> 00:17:26,470
- India, don't do that.
- What?

168
00:17:26,505 --> 00:17:28,671
- What? What'd she do?
- She just gave 'em the finger.

169
00:17:31,413 --> 00:17:33,648
- Mom. Mom, I'm scared.
- Tony.

170
00:17:33,723 --> 00:17:34,815
Speed up.

171
00:17:34,888 --> 00:17:37,165
- It's all right, it's all right.
- No, I don't like this.

172
00:17:37,189 --> 00:17:38,897
It's all right.

173
00:17:38,921 --> 00:17:41,356
Speed up. Tony.

174
00:17:41,391 --> 00:17:43,079
Shit. Oh, good.

175
00:17:43,114 --> 00:17:45,299
Just let 'em go. Let 'em go.

176
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:51,790
India, don't look at them.

177
00:17:51,858 --> 00:17:54,139
- But, they're...
- Just don't give them any reason.

178
00:17:57,056 --> 00:17:58,826
Why is he smiling like that?

179
00:17:58,875 --> 00:18:01,355
I don't know, sweetheart.
It's all right. It's all right.

180
00:18:06,697 --> 00:18:08,611
Whoo!

181
00:18:08,691 --> 00:18:09,897
He's crazy.

182
00:18:10,511 --> 00:18:12,071
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, my God.

183
00:18:17,393 --> 00:18:18,458
Shit.

184
00:18:23,352 --> 00:18:26,329
Hey, motherfucker, pull
over. Pull the fuck over!

185
00:18:26,436 --> 00:18:27,938
Oh, God, Tony.

186
00:18:35,791 --> 00:18:38,494
India. Is your phone working yet, India?

187
00:18:38,569 --> 00:18:40,930
No, no, but I took down the license number.

188
00:18:48,263 --> 00:18:49,373
No.

189
00:18:53,067 --> 00:18:54,334
No.

190
00:18:54,898 --> 00:18:56,233
Oh, no.

191
00:19:00,103 --> 00:19:02,873
- Pull over. Pull the fuck over!
- Dad. Dad.

192
00:19:02,931 --> 00:19:04,867
Hey, asshole, pull over. Pull over.

193
00:19:06,301 --> 00:19:08,354
- Oh, no.
- What do you want from us?

194
00:19:08,422 --> 00:19:10,425
Easy, easy. Easy, easy!

195
00:19:11,794 --> 00:19:12,862
Stop it!

196
00:19:16,919 --> 00:19:17,919
Shit.

197
00:19:19,588 --> 00:19:21,258
Hey, come on!

198
00:19:42,070 --> 00:19:44,669
Don't worry, honey. It's okay.

199
00:19:52,629 --> 00:19:54,415
They probably have a gun.

200
00:19:54,492 --> 00:19:56,214
Please, Tony, pull out.

201
00:19:56,308 --> 00:19:58,092
I can't move. He's blocked the car.

202
00:19:59,662 --> 00:20:00,761
What's he doing?

203
00:20:12,728 --> 00:20:15,289
It's okay. Don't get out the car.

204
00:20:15,337 --> 00:20:17,057
I'm not getting out of the car, sweetheart.

205
00:20:25,848 --> 00:20:27,286
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

206
00:20:27,344 --> 00:20:29,400
You know you're supposed to stop
when there's an accident, right?

207
00:20:29,424 --> 00:20:32,195
- Yeah, I know that.
- Why didn't you stop, then?

208
00:20:35,184 --> 00:20:36,573
That won't work.

209
00:20:37,507 --> 00:20:39,070
No signal here.

210
00:20:40,937 --> 00:20:43,522
You're not supposed to leave the
scene of an accident. It's a crime.

211
00:20:43,546 --> 00:20:46,537
- After the way you were driving...
- I'm sorry, what'd you say?

212
00:20:46,619 --> 00:20:48,856
Just the way you
were driving was crazy.

213
00:20:49,490 --> 00:20:50,650
Hey, Turk.

214
00:20:54,776 --> 00:20:56,646
- Don't come any closer.
- All right, sweetheart. It's all right.

215
00:20:56,670 --> 00:21:00,135
You know, please just get back in
your car now and leave us alone.

216
00:21:00,196 --> 00:21:02,542
Calm down. We got an accident
to report, that's all.

217
00:21:02,589 --> 00:21:05,773
- Calm down. Hey, lady, lady, lady.
- It's a flashlight, sweetheart.

218
00:21:05,855 --> 00:21:08,079
It's just a flashlight. It's all right.

219
00:21:08,838 --> 00:21:12,743
- Jesus Christ.
- Okay, so let's exchange information.

220
00:21:12,864 --> 00:21:14,380
- Information?
- Yeah.

221
00:21:14,434 --> 00:21:16,603
- Let's exchange information.
- Get it out of the glove compartment.

222
00:21:16,627 --> 00:21:19,842
Okay, I'm a Gemini. My
favorite color's pale pink.

223
00:21:19,903 --> 00:21:22,307
I like long walks and kittens.

224
00:21:36,364 --> 00:21:39,432
We should... You know what?
We should call the police.

225
00:21:39,507 --> 00:21:42,382
- Oh, oh? Really?
- Yeah. Yeah.

226
00:21:42,417 --> 00:21:43,806
That's a great idea.

227
00:21:43,841 --> 00:21:45,896
- It was your fucking fault, right?
- What?

228
00:21:45,968 --> 00:21:48,578
It doesn't matter whose
fault it was. Let's get going.

229
00:21:48,652 --> 00:21:50,135
Hey, Ray, these
guys have got a flat tire.

230
00:21:50,159 --> 00:21:52,574
- They sure do.
- Well, what do you know?

231
00:21:52,711 --> 00:21:55,292
- What'd he say?
- Don't believe it, Dad.

232
00:21:56,264 --> 00:21:58,126
- He said we had a flat tire.
- What did he say?

233
00:21:58,150 --> 00:21:59,990
Don't believe
him. We don't have a flat.

234
00:22:04,391 --> 00:22:05,588
- What?
- What?

235
00:22:05,688 --> 00:22:08,393
Yep, your left tire's flat. It sure is.

236
00:22:09,572 --> 00:22:12,039
Must have bust it when you
were shoving us off the road.

237
00:22:12,096 --> 00:22:15,006
We did not shove you off the
road. You shoved us off the road.

238
00:22:15,059 --> 00:22:17,941
- It's a lie.
- You think I'm a liar?

239
00:22:18,099 --> 00:22:19,335
It's okay. It's okay.

240
00:22:19,414 --> 00:22:21,537
- She's just a child.
- You think I'm a liar?

241
00:22:21,598 --> 00:22:24,786
No, she's not saying that,
man. She's just a child.

242
00:22:26,740 --> 00:22:30,591
You don't got a flat, go on, drive.

243
00:22:31,270 --> 00:22:34,292
- Start the engine and drive.
- Please drive. Just drive.

244
00:22:34,364 --> 00:22:37,653
Just drive on it, asshole.
Nobody's stopping you. Drive away.

245
00:22:37,700 --> 00:22:39,475
Go. Fuck off.

246
00:22:39,510 --> 00:22:41,180
Stupid motherfucker.

247
00:22:41,479 --> 00:22:45,161
- Shit. God damn it!
- Oh, God. Oh, God.

248
00:22:45,322 --> 00:22:47,363
- Oh, God.
- It's okay. It's all right.

249
00:22:47,554 --> 00:22:49,836
It's not okay. We're
in the middle of nowhere.

250
00:22:49,918 --> 00:22:52,439
What are we gonna do,
Tony? What are we gonna do?

251
00:22:52,553 --> 00:22:54,195
What are we gonna do, Tony?

252
00:22:54,990 --> 00:22:56,094
I tell you what.

253
00:22:57,906 --> 00:22:59,608
We'll fix it for you, won't we, guys?

254
00:22:59,716 --> 00:23:01,060
Yeah, sure.

255
00:23:03,809 --> 00:23:04,736
- Really?
- Yeah.

256
00:23:04,808 --> 00:23:06,863
Just to show you we're
okay, we'll fix it for you.

257
00:23:06,944 --> 00:23:08,546
You won't have to do a thing.

258
00:23:08,634 --> 00:23:11,129
Then we'll go to the cops together, right?

259
00:23:11,195 --> 00:23:13,815
- You and me, report your accident.
- All right.

260
00:23:13,868 --> 00:23:15,080
- Thank you.
- Sound good?

261
00:23:15,147 --> 00:23:16,226
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

262
00:23:16,258 --> 00:23:17,773
- You got tools, mister?
- Um, I actually, I...

263
00:23:17,797 --> 00:23:19,865
No need. Use ours. Come
on, let's get going.

264
00:23:20,979 --> 00:23:22,192
No, it's fine, it's just fine.

265
00:23:22,216 --> 00:23:25,934
I can't fix a tire, so I
can't... I need their help.

266
00:23:25,969 --> 00:23:28,237
Please don't make
eye contact with them.

267
00:23:38,648 --> 00:23:40,232
You got a spare tire, man?

268
00:23:42,645 --> 00:23:44,502
Can't change a tire without a spare.

269
00:23:46,113 --> 00:23:47,705
You wanna give me
the keys to the trunk?

270
00:23:47,729 --> 00:23:49,843
- No, don't.
- Who the fuck do you think you are?

271
00:23:51,119 --> 00:23:52,716
Just pop the trunk, honey.

272
00:23:54,398 --> 00:23:55,638
I got it.

273
00:23:56,637 --> 00:23:58,540
That's all right, I got that. That's fine.

274
00:23:58,811 --> 00:24:01,118
It's right underneath here. There you go.

275
00:24:01,226 --> 00:24:02,595
Just right under there.

276
00:24:03,451 --> 00:24:05,323
Just got a lot of things in here.

277
00:24:10,982 --> 00:24:12,738
It's just right under there.

278
00:24:13,796 --> 00:24:16,291
- Sorry.
- Get the women out of the car.

279
00:24:16,604 --> 00:24:17,686
Come on, get 'em out.

280
00:24:20,289 --> 00:24:21,715
Come on, man.

281
00:24:21,862 --> 00:24:24,131
Gotta lift your car up on
the jack, so get 'em out.

282
00:24:28,432 --> 00:24:32,067
Dude. Has he gotta lift your
wife and your child and the car?

283
00:24:32,112 --> 00:24:33,903
- Right, right.
- Get your women out the car.

284
00:24:33,967 --> 00:24:36,926
It's all right, honey. Just get out
of the car. They need to fix the car.

285
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:40,042
They're fine. They're just fixing the tire.

286
00:24:45,180 --> 00:24:46,180
Come over here.

287
00:24:47,609 --> 00:24:50,501
Come on, here. Have you
seen what you did to my car?

288
00:24:51,782 --> 00:24:54,822
- You think you're fucking hot shit, don't you?
- What are you talking about?

289
00:24:55,629 --> 00:24:57,891
They definitely think
they're fucking hot shit.

290
00:24:58,062 --> 00:24:59,169
- Who?
- Are you serious?

291
00:24:59,241 --> 00:25:01,567
- Your bitches, man. Who else?
- Look...

292
00:25:01,669 --> 00:25:05,194
No, you think you're so special, you
can just bump another guy's car...

293
00:25:05,258 --> 00:25:09,545
No, we were just trying to get... You
were playing some kind of crazy game.

294
00:25:09,992 --> 00:25:12,908
Hey!

295
00:25:18,658 --> 00:25:20,349
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, God.

296
00:25:20,384 --> 00:25:21,405
Oh, my...

297
00:25:27,356 --> 00:25:29,073
There goes your cops.

298
00:25:30,658 --> 00:25:32,463
You should have tried harder to stop 'em.

299
00:25:33,315 --> 00:25:36,085
That's okay. It's okay.
We'll take good care of you.

300
00:25:39,340 --> 00:25:42,053
Fucking bitch. Uppity rich bitch.

301
00:25:42,143 --> 00:25:44,133
I'll teach you a fucking thing or two.

302
00:25:46,843 --> 00:25:47,844
It's okay.

303
00:25:52,762 --> 00:25:54,865
What? What you looking at?

304
00:25:55,150 --> 00:25:56,692
- Hotshot.
- What do you mean?

305
00:25:56,749 --> 00:25:58,869
What are you trying to
do there on the road, huh?

306
00:25:59,241 --> 00:26:02,044
What? I... What are you talking about?

307
00:26:02,632 --> 00:26:04,394
Look, look, look...

308
00:26:05,273 --> 00:26:10,557
We... We are... We are just trying
to get where... Where we are going.

309
00:26:10,652 --> 00:26:11,754
Where's that?

310
00:26:13,889 --> 00:26:15,843
- I said where you going?
- To Marfa.

311
00:26:15,951 --> 00:26:17,757
What exactly is in Marfa?

312
00:26:19,308 --> 00:26:20,509
- Hey, motherfucker...
- Hey!

313
00:26:20,573 --> 00:26:22,841
- Leave my dad alone, asshole!
- Leave me alone, man.

314
00:26:22,865 --> 00:26:23,426
Fuck you, baby.

315
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:24,922
She didn't mean that. She's just a kid.

316
00:26:24,946 --> 00:26:26,042
Your daddy won't
tell me, so why don't you?

317
00:26:26,066 --> 00:26:29,087
Let me go! What's it to you anyway?

318
00:26:29,122 --> 00:26:31,489
- Look, we're nice guys.
- Don't touch my daughter!

319
00:26:31,513 --> 00:26:33,440
We're just trying to
get to where we're going.

320
00:26:35,554 --> 00:26:37,827
You wanna dance? Wanna dance?

321
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:39,577
Oh, is that it? That all?

322
00:26:39,612 --> 00:26:42,839
Baby, look at your daddy. He thinks
he's so much better than me, huh?

323
00:26:42,907 --> 00:26:44,284
What do you think? What do you think?

324
00:26:44,308 --> 00:26:46,934
- Well, he is.
- I mean, seriously, look at him.

325
00:26:47,028 --> 00:26:48,145
Let her go!

326
00:26:49,110 --> 00:26:50,833
You're scum, you know!

327
00:26:52,241 --> 00:26:54,787
- No! No!
- Hey! Hey, get off.

328
00:26:58,060 --> 00:27:01,096
Hey, watch it, you fucking assholes.

329
00:27:01,691 --> 00:27:04,005
You got no fucking right
talking to me like that.

330
00:27:04,636 --> 00:27:08,164
Christ's sake! Fixing your goddamn tire.

331
00:27:08,459 --> 00:27:10,538
Let's go and get the
fuck out of here, y'all.

332
00:27:10,958 --> 00:27:11,958
India.

333
00:27:13,669 --> 00:27:15,692
Don't cry, sweetie. It's fine.

334
00:27:16,232 --> 00:27:18,430
You all right over
there? Need a tissue?

335
00:27:20,205 --> 00:27:22,754
God damn, that looks bad. You might need...

336
00:27:22,789 --> 00:27:25,106
- I'm fine.
- Hey, honey, you got a tampon?

337
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:27,244
- Your nose looks like shit.
- All right, I'm fine.

338
00:27:27,316 --> 00:27:30,012
- I mean it looks like shit.
- I'm fine.

339
00:27:30,479 --> 00:27:33,002
This is bad news. We good?

340
00:27:33,219 --> 00:27:34,251
We're good. We're set.

341
00:27:34,316 --> 00:27:35,507
- We're good to go.
- Let's go.

342
00:27:35,531 --> 00:27:36,353
- All right.
- We're good.

343
00:27:36,385 --> 00:27:38,101
- All right.
- Yeah.

344
00:27:39,687 --> 00:27:42,170
How far up the road
till we can get a signal?

345
00:27:42,324 --> 00:27:43,894
Why do you wanna get further up the road?

346
00:27:43,918 --> 00:27:45,821
So you can leave the
scene of an accident again?

347
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:47,458
Leave him alone.

348
00:27:51,839 --> 00:27:54,264
- There's service up by Bailey.
- All right.

349
00:27:54,370 --> 00:27:56,210
How do you think we're
gonna get there, though?

350
00:27:56,279 --> 00:27:58,408
- In our cars.
- Which car?

351
00:27:58,511 --> 00:27:59,802
In both cars.

352
00:27:59,900 --> 00:28:02,522
- Mister, don't try no fucking shit with me.
- What?

353
00:28:02,610 --> 00:28:05,667
You heard me. I know what you're
doing. I know what your plan is.

354
00:28:05,734 --> 00:28:07,925
- What is the matter?
- Don't try no fucking shit with me.

355
00:28:07,949 --> 00:28:11,485
No, what is the matter, man?
What the fuck is wrong with you?

356
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:15,242
How do I know you ain't just gonna
floor the gas and leave me in the dust?

357
00:28:15,357 --> 00:28:17,673
You get in your car and we'll get
in ours and we'll follow you there.

358
00:28:17,697 --> 00:28:20,254
- Fuck you! No way. You go in my car.
- What?

359
00:28:20,354 --> 00:28:22,722
You come with us.
Lou can drive your car.

360
00:28:22,789 --> 00:28:24,792
No, I'm not gonna do that. No.

361
00:28:24,859 --> 00:28:28,123
Okay, fine, you drive your
car and the girl comes with us.

362
00:28:28,195 --> 00:28:30,802
- What? No!
- You come with us, baby.

363
00:28:30,866 --> 00:28:31,705
Listen, honey, I ain't
after your fucking ass.

364
00:28:31,768 --> 00:28:33,123
No, don't touch me.

365
00:28:34,349 --> 00:28:35,618
You are not doing that.

366
00:28:39,615 --> 00:28:42,517
- Yeah, baby. You like it like that, huh?
- Let me go!

367
00:28:42,552 --> 00:28:45,059
No. Hey, wait!

368
00:28:45,094 --> 00:28:46,822
What are you doing?

369
00:28:46,904 --> 00:28:48,076
Stop! Get off her, please!

370
00:28:48,100 --> 00:28:49,735
Go over there.

371
00:28:49,932 --> 00:28:51,395
Get your hands off her!

372
00:28:51,774 --> 00:28:52,941
India.

373
00:28:53,013 --> 00:28:56,225
Bye-bye, sweetheart. I love you.

374
00:28:56,336 --> 00:28:57,470
India...

375
00:28:57,538 --> 00:29:00,602
- Let go of me, please.
- Get your hands off her.

376
00:29:01,336 --> 00:29:02,338
Shit.

377
00:29:02,485 --> 00:29:03,686
India...

378
00:29:04,707 --> 00:29:06,179
Look what you gone and did.

379
00:29:08,429 --> 00:29:09,822
Hey, hey. It's okay.

380
00:29:09,902 --> 00:29:12,547
She the boss? Is she
the boss of your family?

381
00:29:12,582 --> 00:29:15,091
- Laura?
- Have you got a vagina?

382
00:29:15,142 --> 00:29:17,045
Have you got a fucking vagina there?

383
00:29:17,592 --> 00:29:18,592
Hey!

384
00:29:18,653 --> 00:29:19,452
- Laura!
- Vagina boy!

385
00:29:19,487 --> 00:29:22,146
- Just get her in the car. Get her in the car.
- Vagina boy!

386
00:29:22,198 --> 00:29:24,936
- Stay away!
- You want fucking something, boy?

387
00:29:24,971 --> 00:29:25,669
- Tony.
- You want something?

388
00:29:25,757 --> 00:29:27,024
- Tony.
- Laura.

389
00:29:27,473 --> 00:29:29,462
- Get in the car.
- Okay, here we go.

390
00:29:29,925 --> 00:29:31,675
We're goin' in both cars. Hey, Lou.

391
00:29:32,287 --> 00:29:33,655
No.

392
00:29:40,013 --> 00:29:41,470
Dad. Dad.

393
00:29:41,505 --> 00:29:43,021
- Hey!
- Dad. Dad.

394
00:29:43,088 --> 00:29:45,010
Hey! Wait! No.

395
00:29:45,148 --> 00:29:48,837
No! Please, no! No! No! Please...

396
00:30:07,879 --> 00:30:08,879
Susan?

397
00:30:09,106 --> 00:30:11,576
Why didn't you call me and
let me know you got in safely?

398
00:30:11,611 --> 00:30:14,134
'Cause it's 4:00 in the
morning. I didn't wanna wake you.

399
00:30:14,203 --> 00:30:16,665
<i>If you can't sleep, why don't
you take one of your pills?</i>

400
00:30:18,300 --> 00:30:19,200
Where are you?

401
00:30:19,247 --> 00:30:21,969
I'm just walking in the door of the hotel.

402
00:30:22,035 --> 00:30:24,179
- What floor, sir?
- 31, please.

403
00:30:24,214 --> 00:30:25,808
That's not our usual floor.

404
00:30:27,523 --> 00:30:29,976
No, our regular room wasn't available.

405
00:30:30,011 --> 00:30:32,277
<i>You should have seen the
scene I caused in the lobby.</i>

406
00:30:36,031 --> 00:30:38,102
I hope you got some sleep on the plane.

407
00:30:38,161 --> 00:30:41,097
<i>I do worry about you. Even though
you think that I don't, I do.</i>

408
00:30:42,510 --> 00:30:44,512
You must be exhausted.

409
00:30:44,620 --> 00:30:46,989
- I hate that flight. It's really not...
- 31, madam.

410
00:30:49,124 --> 00:30:52,918
<i>I'm at my floor. I gotta run.
I'll call you later, okay? Susan?</i>

411
00:30:58,153 --> 00:30:59,512
<i>Susan, can you hear me?</i>

412
00:31:02,691 --> 00:31:06,416
Yes. Yes, I heard you.

413
00:31:09,332 --> 00:31:10,806
Get some sleep.

414
00:31:36,011 --> 00:31:37,378
You're driving.

415
00:31:49,038 --> 00:31:50,930
- Is this the exit?
- Exit for what?

416
00:31:50,997 --> 00:31:52,659
- Well, for Bailey.
- Keep going.

417
00:32:02,698 --> 00:32:03,871
Keep going. Speed up.

418
00:32:12,292 --> 00:32:16,214
- What the fuck are you doing to us?
- Here. Turn down here.

419
00:32:16,899 --> 00:32:19,557
No, fuck you. I am not
going down that road.

420
00:32:19,636 --> 00:32:22,700
Listen, mister, you wanna
see your wife and kid?

421
00:32:24,546 --> 00:32:26,548
Then turn down the road.

422
00:32:28,138 --> 00:32:29,473
You gonna cry now?

423
00:33:01,690 --> 00:33:03,092
That's my car we just passed.

424
00:33:03,127 --> 00:33:05,440
It ain't your car, man. Keep going.

425
00:33:06,574 --> 00:33:09,179
I don't think you need to
worry about your wife and kid.

426
00:33:11,995 --> 00:33:13,835
Like I say, you don't
need to worry about them.

427
00:33:13,908 --> 00:33:17,011
What do you mean, I don't need to worry
about them? What the fuck does that mean?

428
00:33:17,035 --> 00:33:20,039
Calm down. He ain't never killed
nobody yet, that's all I mean.

429
00:33:20,363 --> 00:33:21,938
Least as far as I know he ain't.

430
00:33:21,973 --> 00:33:23,591
Killed? What are you
talking about, killing?

431
00:33:23,615 --> 00:33:25,785
I said he ain't killed nobody yet.

432
00:33:26,621 --> 00:33:29,590
If you'd listen to me,
you'd hear what I was saying.

433
00:33:55,797 --> 00:34:00,469
Well, looks like we've run out
of road and they ain't here.

434
00:34:01,089 --> 00:34:03,467
I wonder if I made a mistake.

435
00:34:03,545 --> 00:34:05,281
It's time for you to get out now, okay?

436
00:34:06,229 --> 00:34:08,575
- Get out!
- What are you... What are you doing?

437
00:34:12,105 --> 00:34:14,408
- You'll get killed if you don't watch it.
- Wait.

438
00:34:15,161 --> 00:34:16,861
Wait!

439
00:34:16,918 --> 00:34:19,340
No, wait. Wait, wait, wait!

440
00:34:19,413 --> 00:34:20,947
No! No!

441
00:35:13,100 --> 00:35:15,036
What did you fucking
leave him out here for?

442
00:35:19,405 --> 00:35:20,886
Hey, mister!

443
00:35:23,158 --> 00:35:24,694
Your wife wants you!

444
00:35:27,274 --> 00:35:28,576
Get in the fucking car.

445
00:35:29,869 --> 00:35:32,849
Hey, mister! Your wife!

446
00:35:35,049 --> 00:35:36,652
Mister!

447
00:35:38,246 --> 00:35:39,449
Shit.

448
00:37:28,716 --> 00:37:29,951
Hey.

449
00:37:33,642 --> 00:37:34,877
Hey!

450
00:37:36,132 --> 00:37:38,201
Hey! Hey!

451
00:37:53,134 --> 00:37:54,136
Hey.

452
00:37:56,231 --> 00:37:57,488
May I use your phone?

453
00:38:15,136 --> 00:38:16,956
<i>Mr. Hastings,
there's no town</i>

454
00:38:17,007 --> 00:38:19,362
near here called Bailey.

455
00:38:19,433 --> 00:38:20,401
I was afraid of that.

456
00:38:20,436 --> 00:38:23,973
There's a motel across
the street. You got money?

457
00:38:24,551 --> 00:38:26,766
I have... I have credit cards.

458
00:38:26,849 --> 00:38:29,604
It's still early, Mr. Hastings.

459
00:38:29,775 --> 00:38:32,708
But we'll call if we get anything.

460
00:38:32,807 --> 00:38:34,075
All right, thank you.

461
00:39:37,672 --> 00:39:38,715
Hello?

462
00:39:39,313 --> 00:39:41,798
<i>This is Lieutenant Graves.</i>

463
00:39:42,555 --> 00:39:46,112
<i>They found your car over in a
dried-out arroyo at Topping.</i>

464
00:39:46,306 --> 00:39:49,143
- What about my wife and daughter?
- <i>Still no news.</i>

465
00:39:49,222 --> 00:39:50,607
<i>They weren't in the car.</i>

466
00:39:51,546 --> 00:39:54,666
<i>We're turning the case
over to Lieutenant Andes.</i>

467
00:39:54,754 --> 00:39:57,425
<i>He wants to know if he can
pick you up in a few minutes.</i>

468
00:39:57,658 --> 00:39:59,060
Yeah, I'm ready now.

469
00:40:11,968 --> 00:40:14,616
- Morning.
- Oh, glad to meet you.

470
00:40:14,981 --> 00:40:17,738
I'm Bobby Andes. I look
into things around here.

471
00:40:18,392 --> 00:40:21,549
- You found my car?
- They found it in a creek bed.

472
00:40:25,278 --> 00:40:27,454
Tell you what, we take you back
to the house we picked you up at,

473
00:40:27,478 --> 00:40:29,054
you think you could backtrack from there?

474
00:40:29,078 --> 00:40:30,260
I could try.

475
00:40:32,393 --> 00:40:34,663
Okay, then, you try. Let's go.

476
00:40:40,481 --> 00:40:43,743
It's my understanding these
fellas didn't have any guns.

477
00:40:45,085 --> 00:40:46,085
No.

478
00:40:49,323 --> 00:40:50,409
All right.

479
00:40:51,853 --> 00:40:54,084
So let me get this straight,
you say some fella named Lou

480
00:40:54,108 --> 00:40:56,653
just drove you out into the
brush and left you there?

481
00:40:56,749 --> 00:40:59,820
- No, he made me drive.
- He made you drive.

482
00:41:00,055 --> 00:41:03,426
And then when you started to walk
out, you saw 'em coming in again.

483
00:41:03,592 --> 00:41:06,395
- Yes.
- Hmm. Whose car were they in?

484
00:41:06,449 --> 00:41:08,188
I think it was mine.

485
00:41:08,263 --> 00:41:10,929
You think? What makes you think that?

486
00:41:10,984 --> 00:41:14,102
By the look of it and the sound
of it. It sounded like my car.

487
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:15,729
Could you see 'em in the dark?

488
00:41:19,241 --> 00:41:21,924
- Not very well.
- Did they say anything?

489
00:41:22,004 --> 00:41:24,741
They said, "Mister, your wife wants you."

490
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:30,448
You didn't go to 'em.
Why didn't you go to 'em?

491
00:41:33,675 --> 00:41:35,744
I don't know why I didn't go. I was...

492
00:41:45,964 --> 00:41:48,036
Okay.

493
00:41:48,395 --> 00:41:49,629
Can you take it from here?

494
00:41:50,952 --> 00:41:54,735
Yeah, I came down the highway
and I walked for a long time,

495
00:41:54,803 --> 00:41:56,476
'cause no one stopped for me.

496
00:41:59,413 --> 00:42:01,761
Sergeant, back up slowly down the shoulder.

497
00:42:01,796 --> 00:42:03,435
Put your signal lights on.

498
00:42:18,787 --> 00:42:21,374
Stop the car. Stop the car!

499
00:42:21,455 --> 00:42:23,948
I came out of that
barbwire fence right there.

500
00:42:24,084 --> 00:42:26,087
Right by the reflector. I remember that.

501
00:42:26,140 --> 00:42:28,662
Let's get out and walk. You
said you walked out, right?

502
00:42:33,755 --> 00:42:35,707
I came up... I came up right here,

503
00:42:35,765 --> 00:42:38,701
'cause I walked along
that arroyo over there.

504
00:42:38,916 --> 00:42:40,935
This is part of
the old Valdes place.

505
00:42:41,011 --> 00:42:43,065
There's an old cattle
station down that way a bit

506
00:42:43,151 --> 00:42:44,602
next to where they burn their garbage.

507
00:42:44,626 --> 00:42:46,248
This road leads to it.

508
00:43:42,122 --> 00:43:43,589
Is she all right?

509
00:44:12,014 --> 00:44:15,201
<i>Mom? Is that you?
Is everything all right?</i>

510
00:44:15,259 --> 00:44:18,570
<i>Yeah, yeah, it's fine. I
just wanted to hear your voice.</i>

511
00:44:18,684 --> 00:44:19,786
I miss you.

512
00:44:21,348 --> 00:44:25,152
<i>You woke me up. I'm still in
bed. It's Sunday morning, Mom.</i>

513
00:44:25,555 --> 00:44:26,995
<i>Can I call you later?</i>

514
00:44:27,835 --> 00:44:31,431
Yeah. Yeah, call me later.
Go back to bed, sweetheart.

515
00:44:33,039 --> 00:44:35,351
You sound weird. Are you okay?

516
00:44:36,998 --> 00:44:39,802
I'm fine. I'm fine.

517
00:44:40,646 --> 00:44:42,974
Go back to bed.

518
00:44:43,064 --> 00:44:44,332
I love you.

519
00:44:45,166 --> 00:44:46,248
Me too.

520
00:44:46,453 --> 00:44:48,597
- <i>I'll call you later.</i>
- Okay.

521
00:45:15,357 --> 00:45:17,927
<i>Edward? Edward?</i>

522
00:45:19,347 --> 00:45:20,485
- Hi.
- Susan.

523
00:45:20,549 --> 00:45:22,206
- Hi. God.
- How are you?

524
00:45:22,243 --> 00:45:25,620
- It's good to see someone I know.
- It's good to see you.

525
00:45:26,527 --> 00:45:29,964
You look beautiful, as always.

526
00:45:30,158 --> 00:45:32,457
What are you doing in New York City?

527
00:45:33,460 --> 00:45:37,431
I'm here for an interview
for a scholarship at Columbia.

528
00:45:37,598 --> 00:45:40,169
Columbia? I thought that you
were at the University of Texas

529
00:45:40,201 --> 00:45:41,727
becoming a great writer.

530
00:45:41,762 --> 00:45:44,849
A great writer? I mean, I
don't... I don't think so.

531
00:45:44,884 --> 00:45:46,553
Well, I am...

532
00:45:47,709 --> 00:45:50,446
But aren't you at Yale
becoming a great artist?

533
00:45:50,502 --> 00:45:53,530
Graduated Yale, but I'm at
Columbia getting my master's degree.

534
00:45:53,600 --> 00:45:55,503
- Oh, wow.
- Yeah, art history.

535
00:45:55,608 --> 00:45:57,685
- That's great.
- Yeah.

536
00:45:57,917 --> 00:46:00,119
Listen, do you know
anybody else in New York?

537
00:46:01,454 --> 00:46:02,953
- Just you.
- Just me.

538
00:46:02,988 --> 00:46:04,723
Okay, well, would you like to go to dinner?

539
00:46:06,381 --> 00:46:08,199
- Absolutely.
- Okay.

540
00:46:08,300 --> 00:46:13,699
Okay, great. Just let me... Just let
me drop off my packages at my apartment.

541
00:46:13,734 --> 00:46:15,779
All right, do you want me to grab
them for you? I can hold that.

542
00:46:15,803 --> 00:46:18,279
Yeah, great. Thank you.
Oh... I miss Texas men.

543
00:46:18,340 --> 00:46:20,029
You don't have blizzards
like this in Texas.

544
00:46:20,053 --> 00:46:21,053
No, you don't.

545
00:46:35,621 --> 00:46:38,583
You know that you were my first
crush when we were at Hastings?

546
00:46:39,742 --> 00:46:43,288
I only spent so much time around
your brother just to be around you.

547
00:46:43,704 --> 00:46:45,507
Well, you were his first crush.

548
00:46:46,494 --> 00:46:48,428
- What?
- Yeah.

549
00:46:48,593 --> 00:46:50,738
Well, I had no idea Cooper was gay.

550
00:46:50,910 --> 00:46:54,205
I don't think he knew back then,
but he was obsessed with you.

551
00:46:54,280 --> 00:46:55,280
Mmm.

552
00:46:56,578 --> 00:46:58,814
- Wow.
- Yeah.

553
00:46:59,026 --> 00:47:00,663
If I hadn't caught you
staring at me so much,

554
00:47:00,687 --> 00:47:03,283
I would have thought you
were sleeping with him.

555
00:47:04,785 --> 00:47:06,754
I, actually... I feel terrible.

556
00:47:07,057 --> 00:47:09,020
I haven't called him in a few years.

557
00:47:09,095 --> 00:47:12,366
I feel like I've been a bad
friend. I hope I didn't hurt him.

558
00:47:15,207 --> 00:47:16,698
You're good, you know that?

559
00:47:16,795 --> 00:47:18,601
No, you are. Most guys
would have freaked out

560
00:47:18,671 --> 00:47:20,526
if they found out their best
friend was in love with them.

561
00:47:20,550 --> 00:47:21,838
You're very sweet.

562
00:47:24,084 --> 00:47:27,855
You should call him. He would like that.

563
00:47:27,961 --> 00:47:30,543
My parents have basically disowned him.

564
00:47:30,578 --> 00:47:32,714
They're not really talking anymore.

565
00:47:32,828 --> 00:47:35,417
- Why?
- Why? Are you serious?

566
00:47:35,569 --> 00:47:36,839
Well, you know my parents, right?

567
00:47:36,863 --> 00:47:40,762
They're religious,
conservative, sexist, racist,

568
00:47:41,361 --> 00:47:45,341
Republican, materialistic,
narcissistic, racist.

569
00:47:45,416 --> 00:47:49,345
- I could keep going...
- I'm just wondering what you really think, Susan.

570
00:47:49,415 --> 00:47:51,146
It's true, I know.

571
00:47:51,259 --> 00:47:53,849
But they just see us as a
reflection of themselves,

572
00:47:53,936 --> 00:47:56,906
so they can't accept Cooper for who he is.

573
00:47:57,137 --> 00:48:00,140
I'm not sure how I'm gonna fare.

574
00:48:00,300 --> 00:48:02,326
Aren't you being a little hard on them?

575
00:48:03,178 --> 00:48:04,453
No.

576
00:48:04,518 --> 00:48:07,177
They have an antiquated idea
of how I should live my life.

577
00:48:07,224 --> 00:48:08,825
Especially my mother.

578
00:48:11,275 --> 00:48:13,501
I understand. I've always loved your mom.

579
00:48:13,536 --> 00:48:15,286
- Really?
- Oh, yeah.

580
00:48:15,360 --> 00:48:17,824
She was great with me when my dad died.

581
00:48:18,064 --> 00:48:19,561
Mmm.

582
00:48:19,619 --> 00:48:22,289
You both have the same kind
of sadness in your eyes.

583
00:48:24,751 --> 00:48:26,753
- What?
- You and your mother.

584
00:48:28,175 --> 00:48:30,071
That is a weird thing to say, Edward.

585
00:48:30,146 --> 00:48:32,397
Oh, I'm sorry. I don't mean to offend you.

586
00:48:32,471 --> 00:48:35,475
I just... She just always seemed sad to me.

587
00:48:36,504 --> 00:48:38,479
She has sad eyes.

588
00:48:38,521 --> 00:48:40,522
And I've thought that
since I was a little boy.

589
00:48:41,193 --> 00:48:43,162
You have the same eyes.

590
00:48:45,038 --> 00:48:49,054
They're beautiful.

591
00:48:57,210 --> 00:49:00,081
Just don't say I'm like my mom,
okay? I don't wanna be like her.

592
00:49:04,285 --> 00:49:06,125
It's funny, 'cause I
always envied your family.

593
00:49:06,191 --> 00:49:09,463
I felt like such an impostor at school.

594
00:49:09,638 --> 00:49:13,013
You did? I thought I was the
only one who felt like that.

595
00:49:13,048 --> 00:49:14,240
- You?
- Yeah.

596
00:49:14,301 --> 00:49:16,404
I was so busy trying to be perfect and...

597
00:49:16,491 --> 00:49:19,106
- And you don't feel that way?
- No.

598
00:49:19,193 --> 00:49:21,668
That's exactly what makes you so perfect.

599
00:49:24,480 --> 00:49:26,152
You are gonna be a great novelist,

600
00:49:26,250 --> 00:49:30,320
'cause you have created a fictitious
character in your head about...

601
00:49:30,531 --> 00:49:31,632
- No.
- Yes.

602
00:49:31,698 --> 00:49:33,401
- No.
- Yes.

603
00:49:33,435 --> 00:49:34,603
No.

604
00:49:35,469 --> 00:49:37,238
I don't believe that.

605
00:49:39,779 --> 00:49:42,037
Why'd you give up on becoming an artist?

606
00:49:45,700 --> 00:49:48,294
Because I'm too cynical to be an artist.

607
00:49:49,088 --> 00:49:50,537
I think that to be really, really good,

608
00:49:50,561 --> 00:49:54,266
you have to come from someplace
inside that I'm just not sure I have.

609
00:49:55,316 --> 00:49:57,375
You underestimate yourself.

610
00:49:59,165 --> 00:50:00,513
Do you know that?

611
00:50:08,068 --> 00:50:10,505
Edward, um,

612
00:50:13,553 --> 00:50:15,001
will you come home with me?

613
00:50:17,416 --> 00:50:19,312
Well, that's a bit forward.

614
00:50:19,357 --> 00:50:20,811
Yeah.

615
00:50:20,872 --> 00:50:23,387
It's not what I'd expect
from a Texas debutante.

616
00:50:23,457 --> 00:50:25,905
Well, you know all
debutantes are sluts, so...

617
00:50:25,985 --> 00:50:27,589
Hmm.

618
00:50:27,655 --> 00:50:29,175
- Hmm.
- Hmm.

619
00:50:30,118 --> 00:50:32,093
And you were my first crush too.

620
00:50:33,687 --> 00:50:34,687
I know.

621
00:51:01,847 --> 00:51:04,046
We got a report from Ozona.

622
00:51:04,584 --> 00:51:08,231
Someone else harassed on the
highway last night just like you.

623
00:51:14,366 --> 00:51:17,277
If you don't mind, we
could use your fingerprints.

624
00:51:17,348 --> 00:51:17,962
Mine?

625
00:51:18,013 --> 00:51:20,185
There's just a bunch of
prints on the trunk of the car.

626
00:51:20,234 --> 00:51:21,781
It could help us sort 'em out.

627
00:51:26,821 --> 00:51:28,168
There's something else.

628
00:51:28,832 --> 00:51:30,051
Yeah?

629
00:51:30,225 --> 00:51:32,254
We have the cause of death.

630
00:51:36,692 --> 00:51:40,687
Your wife had a fractured skull.

631
00:51:40,770 --> 00:51:44,033
She was probably struck with
a hammer or a baseball bat,

632
00:51:44,094 --> 00:51:46,230
probably just once or twice, so...

633
00:51:48,722 --> 00:51:51,577
Your daughter had a
much more difficult time.

634
00:51:51,839 --> 00:51:53,683
She was suffocated.

635
00:51:57,417 --> 00:51:59,372
She also had a broken arm.

636
00:52:01,675 --> 00:52:03,579
And they had both been raped.

637
00:52:07,887 --> 00:52:11,347
It turns out you were right
about that trailer, too.

638
00:52:12,199 --> 00:52:12,813
How?

639
00:52:12,887 --> 00:52:14,978
Those fellas, they took
your folks in there,

640
00:52:15,069 --> 00:52:16,205
just like you thought.

641
00:52:18,258 --> 00:52:19,212
How do you know that?

642
00:52:19,279 --> 00:52:22,255
We found your wife's
fingerprints on the bedpost.

643
00:52:23,530 --> 00:52:25,927
- Whose trailer is it?
- It's clear.

644
00:52:26,480 --> 00:52:29,223
Guy doesn't even live
here. He's in El Paso.

645
00:52:29,303 --> 00:52:32,000
Trailer's been broken into.
Somebody's been living in it.

646
00:52:32,081 --> 00:52:33,439
There's prints all over the place.

647
00:52:33,463 --> 00:52:35,259
We're gonna have to check
'em against the owner's,

648
00:52:35,283 --> 00:52:37,085
see if we can separate 'em out.

649
00:52:37,179 --> 00:52:38,133
- Right.
- I'm hopeful, though.

650
00:52:38,201 --> 00:52:41,033
The owner hasn't been
there since last fall, so...

651
00:52:42,669 --> 00:52:44,157
Looks promising.

652
00:52:48,248 --> 00:52:49,450
Prom...

653
00:52:51,618 --> 00:52:52,891
Promising?

654
00:53:05,071 --> 00:53:07,339
<i>Why didn't you
tell me this before?</i>

655
00:53:07,587 --> 00:53:10,100
<i>You're actually
gonna leave New York,</i>

656
00:53:10,254 --> 00:53:13,760
move to Austin and go to the
goddamn University of Texas?

657
00:53:14,881 --> 00:53:16,157
Why are you doing this?

658
00:53:16,985 --> 00:53:18,454
I mean, where is this gonna go?

659
00:53:18,573 --> 00:53:19,849
What do you mean, where
is this going to go?

660
00:53:19,873 --> 00:53:22,455
I'm going to marry Edward.
That's where this is going to go.

661
00:53:22,490 --> 00:53:24,421
This is a ridiculous conversation.

662
00:53:25,098 --> 00:53:26,879
You're too young to get married.

663
00:53:27,582 --> 00:53:28,864
Really?

664
00:53:29,189 --> 00:53:32,810
Mom, last summer you tried to
convince me that I had to marry Bass.

665
00:53:32,887 --> 00:53:34,822
That is different.

666
00:53:35,422 --> 00:53:37,366
Bass is your equal.

667
00:53:37,401 --> 00:53:40,430
Oh, my God. Did you just say
that? You really just said that.

668
00:53:40,518 --> 00:53:42,721
That came out of your mouth. That's...

669
00:53:44,671 --> 00:53:47,002
Why do you always think the worst of me?

670
00:53:49,563 --> 00:53:51,592
That is not what I meant.

671
00:53:52,017 --> 00:53:57,486
What I meant is that you
are very strong-willed,

672
00:53:57,581 --> 00:54:00,584
and Edward, as sweet as he
is, he's too weak for you.

673
00:54:00,767 --> 00:54:03,895
Weak is not a word that I
would use to describe Edward.

674
00:54:03,987 --> 00:54:05,468
Sensitive is a word that I would use,

675
00:54:05,561 --> 00:54:08,776
which isn't a word I would use to
describe anyone else in this family,

676
00:54:08,824 --> 00:54:09,918
except maybe Cooper.

677
00:54:09,974 --> 00:54:11,876
Don't bring Cooper into this.

678
00:54:12,670 --> 00:54:13,670
Sorry.

679
00:54:15,032 --> 00:54:16,930
Come on, Susan.

680
00:54:17,968 --> 00:54:20,515
I know you think that we don't
care about the same things,

681
00:54:20,589 --> 00:54:22,032
but you're wrong.

682
00:54:22,106 --> 00:54:25,475
In a few years, all these bourgeois
things, as you so like to call them,

683
00:54:25,586 --> 00:54:27,593
are gonna be very important to you,

684
00:54:27,657 --> 00:54:29,811
and Edward's not gonna be
able to give them to you.

685
00:54:31,608 --> 00:54:32,973
He has no money.

686
00:54:35,465 --> 00:54:37,602
He's not driven. He's not ambitious.

687
00:54:38,661 --> 00:54:40,567
And I can promise you, if you marry Edward,

688
00:54:40,644 --> 00:54:42,660
your father's not gonna
give them to you either.

689
00:54:43,339 --> 00:54:45,558
No, you're right. He's not driven

690
00:54:45,660 --> 00:54:47,544
the way that you would like him to be.

691
00:54:48,479 --> 00:54:50,396
But he is strong.

692
00:54:50,431 --> 00:54:52,800
He's stronger than I am in a lot of ways.

693
00:54:52,909 --> 00:54:56,546
Just... He just has a different
kind of strength is all.

694
00:54:56,581 --> 00:54:58,652
"A different kind of strength."

695
00:54:58,687 --> 00:55:01,123
And what kind of strength is that?

696
00:55:01,211 --> 00:55:05,171
He has the strength to believe in himself

697
00:55:05,963 --> 00:55:07,293
and believe in me.

698
00:55:08,892 --> 00:55:09,983
Susan,

699
00:55:11,161 --> 00:55:12,963
keep seeing him if you have to,

700
00:55:13,090 --> 00:55:14,210
live with him, I don't care,

701
00:55:14,261 --> 00:55:16,009
but do not marry him.

702
00:55:16,859 --> 00:55:21,002
I understand what
you see in Edward. I get it.

703
00:55:21,037 --> 00:55:22,749
- No.
- No, wait, I do.

704
00:55:22,878 --> 00:55:24,847
- No, you don't. No, you don't.
- Yes, I do.

705
00:55:24,902 --> 00:55:26,837
He is a romantic.

706
00:55:28,047 --> 00:55:30,232
But he is also very fragile.

707
00:55:30,300 --> 00:55:32,176
I saw that when his father died.

708
00:55:34,349 --> 00:55:35,474
Don't...

709
00:55:36,940 --> 00:55:38,441
Don't do this.

710
00:55:40,310 --> 00:55:41,770
You'll regret it.

711
00:55:43,065 --> 00:55:45,539
And you'll only hurt Edward in the end.

712
00:55:47,638 --> 00:55:50,501
The things you love about him
now are the things you'll hate

713
00:55:50,575 --> 00:55:51,932
in a few years.

714
00:55:53,731 --> 00:55:55,588
You may not realize it,

715
00:55:55,662 --> 00:56:00,278
but you and I are a lot
more alike than you think.

716
00:56:03,046 --> 00:56:07,259
No. You're wrong. You
and I are nothing alike.

717
00:56:07,937 --> 00:56:09,129
Really?

718
00:56:11,413 --> 00:56:12,815
Just wait.

719
00:56:14,144 --> 00:56:16,689
We all eventually turn into our mothers.

720
00:56:25,094 --> 00:56:33,094
_

721
00:56:58,956 --> 00:57:01,145
<i>- Yeah?</i>
- Tony Hastings?

722
00:57:03,237 --> 00:57:04,733
Yes. Who is this?

723
00:57:04,791 --> 00:57:09,212
Roberto Andes. I've sent
you an email. You get it?

724
00:57:09,294 --> 00:57:09,908
Yes.

725
00:57:09,966 --> 00:57:11,497
Well, you recognize the guy?

726
00:57:12,322 --> 00:57:14,359
- No.
- <i>Shit.</i>

727
00:57:14,878 --> 00:57:16,914
God damn it. You sure?

728
00:57:16,947 --> 00:57:19,717
Yeah. The whole thing's just a blur.

729
00:57:19,751 --> 00:57:21,515
<i>Well, his prints are
all over your car.</i>

730
00:57:21,578 --> 00:57:24,444
They found 'em at the trailer
too. His name's Steve Adams.

731
00:57:24,479 --> 00:57:26,788
<i>He's got a record in
California. A stolen car,</i>

732
00:57:26,856 --> 00:57:29,693
acquittal on a rape charge.
I put out an APB on him.

733
00:57:29,807 --> 00:57:31,651
<i>He's the only lead we got, Tony,</i>

734
00:57:31,686 --> 00:57:34,221
and I sure as hell don't
have any other witnesses.

735
00:57:35,984 --> 00:57:37,553
<i>You sure you don't recognize him?</i>

736
00:57:39,711 --> 00:57:40,344
No.

737
00:57:40,399 --> 00:57:41,926
Fuck. What's wrong with you, man?

738
00:57:41,972 --> 00:57:43,658
<i>Don't you wanna put these guys away?</i>

739
00:57:43,705 --> 00:57:45,304
Yeah, of course I do.

740
00:57:46,283 --> 00:57:48,308
The whole thing is just some...

741
00:57:50,108 --> 00:57:51,637
Just a blank.

742
00:58:11,171 --> 00:58:12,874
I know it was him.

743
00:58:12,938 --> 00:58:15,684
<i>Well, that may be, but
nobody's seen him around here lately.</i>

744
00:58:15,746 --> 00:58:17,049
<i>Listen, I gotta be honest with you.</i>

745
00:58:17,073 --> 00:58:18,807
<i>Right now it's not looking good.</i>

746
00:58:18,895 --> 00:58:22,779
<i>Sometimes these cases go months
or even years without a break.</i>

747
00:58:22,840 --> 00:58:24,438
<i>You need to prepare
yourself for that.</i>

748
00:59:06,942 --> 00:59:08,737
<i>Why are you
so driven to write?</i>

749
00:59:09,798 --> 00:59:12,763
<i>I guess it's a way
of keeping things alive.</i>

750
00:59:15,085 --> 00:59:18,531
<i>You know, saving things
that will eventually die.</i>

751
00:59:20,518 --> 00:59:22,238
<i>And if I write it down, then,</i>

752
00:59:23,560 --> 00:59:24,956
<i>it'll last forever.</i>

753
00:59:44,708 --> 00:59:46,462
_

754
00:59:53,850 --> 00:59:55,873
- Afternoon.
- Hey, there.

755
00:59:55,908 --> 00:59:58,400
Sorry I'm late. There was
traffic on the interstate.

756
00:59:58,501 --> 00:59:59,636
That's all right.

757
01:00:00,484 --> 01:00:01,837
You look different.

758
01:00:01,885 --> 01:00:02,954
No beard.

759
01:00:05,296 --> 01:00:07,052
You look... You look different too.

760
01:00:08,237 --> 01:00:11,609
Yeah. So I'll tell you what we got.

761
01:00:11,676 --> 01:00:13,107
We had an attempted hold-up

762
01:00:13,142 --> 01:00:16,429
at the supermarket in the mall
last night just before closing.

763
01:00:16,504 --> 01:00:18,238
We caught one of the guys,

764
01:00:18,273 --> 01:00:20,582
one got killed and one got away.

765
01:00:21,498 --> 01:00:23,167
What do you, what do you want me to do?

766
01:00:24,281 --> 01:00:26,341
See if you recognize the guy we caught.

767
01:00:27,698 --> 01:00:29,187
You can look at the dead one too,

768
01:00:29,246 --> 01:00:31,462
although I don't really
think it's necessary.

769
01:00:31,511 --> 01:00:33,432
We know who he is.

770
01:00:33,496 --> 01:00:34,498
Who?

771
01:00:35,238 --> 01:00:36,728
Steve Adams.

772
01:00:38,256 --> 01:00:41,480
The one you called Turk that
I emailed you about last year?

773
01:00:47,765 --> 01:00:48,967
Come on in.

774
01:00:54,512 --> 01:00:57,565
Are you afraid to look this
fella in the eye? Let him see you?

775
01:00:57,600 --> 01:00:58,602
No.

776
01:00:59,517 --> 01:01:01,729
That's good. I think it will help him talk.

777
01:01:15,745 --> 01:01:17,734
That's him, that guy on the left.

778
01:01:17,795 --> 01:01:19,230
On the far left. That's him.

779
01:01:22,286 --> 01:01:24,954
No, no, no, no,
no, no. Hold up, son.

780
01:01:25,061 --> 01:01:26,563
You ain't that lucky. Get over here.

781
01:01:30,698 --> 01:01:32,260
- This fella?
- Yes.

782
01:01:32,295 --> 01:01:35,298
I see. Right. I don't think he understands.

783
01:01:35,351 --> 01:01:37,888
Lou. Lou. Hey, you.

784
01:01:39,159 --> 01:01:41,395
- Your name Lou?
- You know my name. I told you.

785
01:01:41,451 --> 01:01:42,953
- Yeah?
- Yeah. What's going on?

786
01:01:46,108 --> 01:01:49,325
Well, I guess I want you to tell me
if you've ever seen this man before.

787
01:01:50,052 --> 01:01:52,513
Think carefully. You ever seen him?

788
01:01:54,978 --> 01:01:56,446
No, I don't know him.

789
01:01:56,526 --> 01:01:57,595
- Hmm?
- Who is he?

790
01:01:57,683 --> 01:02:00,645
Why don't you tell him,
Tony? Tell him who he is.

791
01:02:00,724 --> 01:02:02,542
Last summer, this man,
Lou, and his friends,

792
01:02:02,580 --> 01:02:04,315
they forced us off the
road on the interstate

793
01:02:04,339 --> 01:02:07,804
and two of them forced their way into
my car with my wife and my daughter.

794
01:02:07,902 --> 01:02:10,252
- And then this man...
- This man? This man Lou?

795
01:02:10,307 --> 01:02:12,543
Yes. Lou, he made me drive his car,

796
01:02:12,928 --> 01:02:15,109
he took me to the middle of
the desert and he left me there.

797
01:02:15,133 --> 01:02:18,478
And later my wife and
daughter were found dead

798
01:02:19,528 --> 01:02:20,908
near the same place.

799
01:02:25,309 --> 01:02:26,603
Well, that ain't right.

800
01:02:36,273 --> 01:02:39,010
What you got to say about
this man's wife and daughter?

801
01:02:39,089 --> 01:02:40,075
I don't know nothing about that.

802
01:02:40,110 --> 01:02:42,213
I've never seen him before in my life.

803
01:02:42,445 --> 01:02:44,566
What you gonna tell me about Ray and Turk?

804
01:02:44,847 --> 01:02:46,579
- Who?
- Who?

805
01:02:48,217 --> 01:02:52,174
What, are you an owl? You an owl, Lou?

806
01:02:52,903 --> 01:02:55,070
- I never heard of 'em.
- You never heard of 'em?

807
01:02:55,650 --> 01:02:56,651
No, sir.

808
01:03:01,424 --> 01:03:02,426
Hmm.

809
01:03:03,154 --> 01:03:04,261
Mmm-hmm.

810
01:03:09,752 --> 01:03:10,754
All right.

811
01:03:14,383 --> 01:03:16,185
Officer.

812
01:03:16,266 --> 01:03:18,036
Put him up.

813
01:03:21,657 --> 01:03:24,882
- Are you sure this is the man?
- Absolutely, yes.

814
01:03:24,947 --> 01:03:27,494
You'll swear in a court of
law under penalty of perjury?

815
01:03:27,542 --> 01:03:28,544
Yes.

816
01:03:34,417 --> 01:03:35,486
Good.

817
01:03:37,380 --> 01:03:40,419
Well, we got Lou.

818
01:03:41,432 --> 01:03:43,112
I'm gonna charge him with murder.

819
01:03:43,179 --> 01:03:44,473
What, do you have enough evidence?

820
01:03:44,497 --> 01:03:47,680
Oh, you bet, between you and the
prints in the car and the trailer.

821
01:03:47,744 --> 01:03:49,744
What, he went back to the
trailer after he left me?

822
01:03:49,821 --> 01:03:53,398
Yeah, looks like it. Uh, he probably
just went back to tell 'em where you were.

823
01:03:54,191 --> 01:03:55,878
That's why they came back with the bodies.

824
01:03:55,948 --> 01:03:57,850
They were, they were gonna kill you.

825
01:03:58,947 --> 01:04:00,738
You see? Yeah.

826
01:04:00,797 --> 01:04:03,726
I bet your friend Ray's the
third fella in the hold-up.

827
01:04:04,814 --> 01:04:08,458
- What now?
- Well, you're gonna wait for trial.

828
01:04:11,371 --> 01:04:13,499
And I'm gonna go find Ray.

829
01:04:20,657 --> 01:04:23,720
Don't forget you have a
board meeting at the museum at 3:00.

830
01:04:25,335 --> 01:04:26,598
I'm sorry. What was that?

831
01:04:31,849 --> 01:04:33,540
You didn't sleep again, did you?

832
01:04:37,178 --> 01:04:40,272
You know me. I never sleep.

833
01:04:42,030 --> 01:04:44,792
My ex-husband used to
call me a nocturnal animal.

834
01:04:44,847 --> 01:04:46,349
What ex-husband?

835
01:04:47,242 --> 01:04:49,221
I didn't know you had an
ex-husband. Since when?

836
01:04:49,256 --> 01:04:51,744
A couple of years in graduate school.

837
01:04:53,597 --> 01:04:55,832
It's weird, I've been thinking
about him a lot lately,

838
01:04:55,900 --> 01:04:58,321
and then recently he sent me
this book that he's written

839
01:04:58,389 --> 01:04:59,402
and it's

840
01:05:00,677 --> 01:05:02,063
violent and it's sad,

841
01:05:02,131 --> 01:05:05,752
and he titled it <i>Nocturnal
Animals</i> and he dedicated it to me.

842
01:05:07,364 --> 01:05:08,587
Did you love him?

843
01:05:08,678 --> 01:05:10,114
Yeah, I loved him.

844
01:05:11,395 --> 01:05:15,487
He was a writer and, uh,
I didn't have faith in him.

845
01:05:16,545 --> 01:05:18,704
I panicked and I did
something horrible to him.

846
01:05:18,768 --> 01:05:21,210
Something unforgivable, really.

847
01:05:21,964 --> 01:05:24,267
- You left him?
- I left him.

848
01:05:25,641 --> 01:05:28,485
I left him in a brutal way,

849
01:05:29,258 --> 01:05:31,764
for the handsome and dashing Hutton.

850
01:05:31,851 --> 01:05:34,184
- Who is very handsome and dashing.
- ...and dashing. Yes.

851
01:05:36,233 --> 01:05:38,238
Do you ever feel like your
life has turned into something

852
01:05:38,262 --> 01:05:39,581
you never intended?

853
01:05:46,995 --> 01:05:47,995
No.

854
01:05:48,979 --> 01:05:51,062
Of course not. You just
started living your life.

855
01:05:53,611 --> 01:05:55,698
You really didn't get any sleep, did you?

856
01:05:59,381 --> 01:06:00,383
No.

857
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:34,547
_

858
01:06:50,046 --> 01:06:51,686
Where did this painting come from?

859
01:06:52,302 --> 01:06:53,527
What do you mean, where did it come from?

860
01:06:53,551 --> 01:06:55,205
You bought it for us, remember?

861
01:06:55,306 --> 01:06:57,309
It was part of the series
like eight years ago.

862
01:06:57,461 --> 01:06:59,293
- It's great, isn't it?
- Yeah.

863
01:06:59,396 --> 01:07:01,832
What is that?

864
01:07:01,984 --> 01:07:03,867
Oh, my God, it's so cool.

865
01:07:03,922 --> 01:07:07,493
It's this app that lets me watch
Willow while she's in her crib.

866
01:07:07,770 --> 01:07:10,574
Really? Do you not trust your nanny?

867
01:07:10,633 --> 01:07:12,735
No, no, I do. I just hate her, so...

868
01:07:12,770 --> 01:07:13,868
And I would like to be more involved

869
01:07:13,892 --> 01:07:15,699
with Willow throughout the day, so...

870
01:07:16,425 --> 01:07:18,973
Look. There she is.

871
01:07:19,254 --> 01:07:21,975
And the sound's incredible. You
can actually hear her breathing.

872
01:07:22,010 --> 01:07:23,487
And I can talk to her if I want to.

873
01:07:25,893 --> 01:07:29,910
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I'm...

874
01:07:29,945 --> 01:07:31,829
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

875
01:07:32,071 --> 01:07:33,406
Yeah, I just...

876
01:07:34,718 --> 01:07:36,080
I thought I saw someone.

877
01:07:39,026 --> 01:07:40,200
Well, you did see someone.

878
01:07:40,262 --> 01:07:41,935
That's Willow and she's in her crib.

879
01:07:41,982 --> 01:07:43,252
She's sleeping.

880
01:07:43,335 --> 01:07:46,725
I'm really sorry about
your phone. I can, um...

881
01:07:46,760 --> 01:07:49,099
It's fine. A new one comes
out next week anyway, so...

882
01:07:49,160 --> 01:07:50,162
Thanks.

883
01:07:50,740 --> 01:07:52,168
Shall we?

884
01:07:53,643 --> 01:07:54,893
They're all waiting for us.

885
01:07:58,293 --> 01:08:02,464
We're under no contractual
obligations. Which is good.

886
01:08:02,499 --> 01:08:04,900
I know we all have different,
you know, opinions about this,

887
01:08:04,947 --> 01:08:06,544
but as far as I'm concerned...

888
01:08:16,419 --> 01:08:18,489
Anyways, I think we should cut her loose.

889
01:08:18,550 --> 01:08:20,510
She isn't who she sold herself
to be when we hired her.

890
01:08:20,534 --> 01:08:22,718
I disagree. I think
we should keep her for now.

891
01:08:22,753 --> 01:08:25,352
- Why is that?
- Because she's great and we all like her.

892
01:08:25,376 --> 01:08:28,012
She just needs our support and
a little bit of time, that's all.

893
01:08:28,099 --> 01:08:30,569
But it's not
working. We need to fire her.

894
01:08:30,643 --> 01:08:32,823
There's an awesome candidate that
we could steal from the Hammer

895
01:08:32,847 --> 01:08:34,585
if we move fast.

896
01:08:34,643 --> 01:08:38,297
I agree with Linda. We hired
her. We should support her.

897
01:08:38,814 --> 01:08:39,885
New doctor?

898
01:08:42,318 --> 01:08:44,285
No. New haircut.

899
01:08:45,740 --> 01:08:47,920
But, Susan, you were the
one who brought it up last meeting

900
01:08:47,944 --> 01:08:50,035
that you were looking for a change.

901
01:08:50,072 --> 01:08:52,248
I know, but now I think we should keep her.

902
01:08:52,668 --> 01:08:54,110
Sometimes it's...

903
01:08:56,965 --> 01:08:59,494
Sometimes maybe it's not such a good idea

904
01:08:59,575 --> 01:09:01,403
to change things quite so much.

905
01:10:17,900 --> 01:10:20,841
I don't get it. What are we doing here?

906
01:10:20,931 --> 01:10:22,600
Shit.

907
01:10:25,359 --> 01:10:26,394
Are you okay?

908
01:10:28,557 --> 01:10:31,427
Yeah. I'm fine. Follow me.

909
01:10:42,786 --> 01:10:44,498
That's Ray Marcus.

910
01:10:44,559 --> 01:10:46,356
He's been named as a frequent companion

911
01:10:46,423 --> 01:10:48,348
of Lou Bates and Steve Adams.

912
01:10:48,978 --> 01:10:51,073
Part-time electrician,
part-time plumber,

913
01:10:51,160 --> 01:10:53,701
hence the clever toilet facilities.

914
01:10:53,756 --> 01:10:55,473
He's not a bad match to your description

915
01:10:55,537 --> 01:10:57,708
and the fella at the hold-up.

916
01:10:57,782 --> 01:11:00,151
No fingerprints, but we knew that before.

917
01:11:00,237 --> 01:11:02,152
I wonder why there aren't any fingerprints.

918
01:11:02,217 --> 01:11:04,305
Well, his hands
were probably on your wife.

919
01:11:06,055 --> 01:11:10,456
His record's clean, except for
a rape charge that got dropped.

920
01:11:10,495 --> 01:11:12,880
I heard from this barman at
this place, Line Camp Bar,

921
01:11:12,948 --> 01:11:14,771
that Ray lives here with a girl named Leila

922
01:11:14,806 --> 01:11:16,316
but he also keeps another spot

923
01:11:16,357 --> 01:11:18,173
to take girls she don't know about,

924
01:11:18,231 --> 01:11:21,123
probably your murder trailer
before it got notorious.

925
01:11:23,660 --> 01:11:25,449
Does he look like he could be the guy?

926
01:11:25,521 --> 01:11:27,157
Yes, that's him.

927
01:11:27,277 --> 01:11:28,479
Good.

928
01:11:29,512 --> 01:11:30,905
Let's talk to him.

929
01:11:43,986 --> 01:11:47,082
- Hey, Ray.
- What the fuck?

930
01:11:47,369 --> 01:11:48,685
Who the hell are you?

931
01:11:49,358 --> 01:11:50,694
Get off my property, man.

932
01:11:53,021 --> 01:11:54,438
Shit, I'll call you back.

933
01:11:54,473 --> 01:11:56,112
I wanna ask you some questions.

934
01:11:56,253 --> 01:11:57,690
Fuck you.

935
01:11:58,295 --> 01:12:00,133
I'm occupied at the moment.

936
01:12:02,157 --> 01:12:04,429
- What's that?
- Just a few questions, that's all.

937
01:12:04,481 --> 01:12:08,242
- We need you to come with us.
- What for? I ain't done nothin'.

938
01:12:08,326 --> 01:12:10,923
- I ain't saying you did.
- Well, ask me here.

939
01:12:10,958 --> 01:12:13,552
No, we need you to take
a little drive with us.

940
01:12:13,587 --> 01:12:15,623
Come on, finish up what
you're doing and let's go.

941
01:12:15,730 --> 01:12:16,832
Do you mind turning round?

942
01:12:20,470 --> 01:12:22,469
Believe me, I wish I could, but...

943
01:12:25,559 --> 01:12:27,182
Fucking unbelievable.

944
01:12:34,122 --> 01:12:36,298
All right, that's enough. Come on.

945
01:12:36,999 --> 01:12:38,052
Come on, now.

946
01:12:39,401 --> 01:12:41,717
All right, come on. Get dressed. Come on.

947
01:12:50,899 --> 01:12:52,220
- You questioning me?
- Yeah.

948
01:12:52,244 --> 01:12:55,803
- Yeah, that's what we're doing, ain't it?
- You ain't read me my rights.

949
01:13:01,729 --> 01:13:04,349
- You know your rights, Ray.
- You're supposed to read 'em to me.

950
01:13:06,268 --> 01:13:08,337
I read you your rights, didn't I, Tony?

951
01:13:10,032 --> 01:13:11,602
Uh-huh.

952
01:13:11,634 --> 01:13:12,930
I read you your rights.

953
01:13:12,972 --> 01:13:15,480
This ain't legal, man. I'm supposed
to have a lawyer or something.

954
01:13:15,504 --> 01:13:17,062
Calm down, sunshine.

955
01:13:17,113 --> 01:13:20,014
This is just informal
questioning, that's all.

956
01:13:20,071 --> 01:13:22,842
You're helping me out. I ain't
charged you with nothing yet.

957
01:13:22,930 --> 01:13:25,567
Now, if you want a lawyer, I
can take you down to the station

958
01:13:25,648 --> 01:13:26,848
and charge you with something.

959
01:13:26,884 --> 01:13:29,467
Oh, come on, man, listen,
you ain't gotta take me in.

960
01:13:29,519 --> 01:13:31,177
I'm answering the
questions, ain't I? Come on.

961
01:13:31,201 --> 01:13:33,890
Give me some
questions. I'll answer your questions.

962
01:13:33,941 --> 01:13:36,823
I don't know any more about this
hold-up than I did before I met you.

963
01:13:36,858 --> 01:13:37,607
I tell you what,

964
01:13:37,668 --> 01:13:38,972
I'm gonna ask you a different question.

965
01:13:38,996 --> 01:13:41,875
- You recognize this car?
- What car?

966
01:13:41,930 --> 01:13:44,303
This one. The one we're driving around in.

967
01:13:44,347 --> 01:13:46,107
Why should I recognize this fucking car?

968
01:13:46,182 --> 01:13:47,526
It ain't familiar to you?

969
01:13:47,587 --> 01:13:49,387
It don't remind you of
nothing, take you back?

970
01:13:49,412 --> 01:13:51,648
- Why should it?
- You don't remember driving it?

971
01:13:51,768 --> 01:13:54,722
- I think I'd know.
- Yeah. How about the driver?

972
01:13:54,837 --> 01:13:56,007
- What?
- This fella?

973
01:13:56,058 --> 01:13:59,066
This fella sitting behind the
steering wheel. My friend Tony?

974
01:13:59,154 --> 01:14:00,290
You remember him?

975
01:14:02,925 --> 01:14:06,444
I can't see him. Make him turn around.

976
01:14:07,132 --> 01:14:08,543
Stop the car, Tony.

977
01:14:13,502 --> 01:14:15,533
Turn around and
look at this piece of shit.

978
01:14:18,815 --> 01:14:20,828
- Who is this guy?
- You don't remember him?

979
01:14:22,953 --> 01:14:25,122
- Can't say I do.
- You remember him, Tony?

980
01:14:25,241 --> 01:14:27,675
- Yes.
- Well, refresh his memory.

981
01:14:27,769 --> 01:14:29,205
Last summer on the interstate.

982
01:14:29,280 --> 01:14:31,276
Tell him what you remember he did.

983
01:14:31,333 --> 01:14:33,336
You killed my wife and my daughter.

984
01:14:33,416 --> 01:14:35,743
That's crazy. I never killed nobody.

985
01:14:35,818 --> 01:14:37,962
- Tell him the whole thing.
- Mmm-mmm.

986
01:14:38,013 --> 01:14:40,658
You and your buddies on the
interstate, you forced us off the road.

987
01:14:40,716 --> 01:14:42,486
- Tell him who his buddies are.
- Lou and Turk.

988
01:14:42,510 --> 01:14:43,342
You remember that, Ray?

989
01:14:43,377 --> 01:14:45,897
You remember horsing around on
the interstate with your buddies,

990
01:14:45,938 --> 01:14:47,358
playing chicken with the other cars?

991
01:14:47,382 --> 01:14:49,866
You're crazy. That's crazy.

992
01:14:49,931 --> 01:14:52,935
You made us stop and we had a
flat tire and Lou and Turk fixed it.

993
01:14:52,970 --> 01:14:55,079
Then you and Turk got in my
car with my wife and my daughter

994
01:14:55,103 --> 01:14:58,474
- and you forced me in your car with Lou.
- What then, Tony?

995
01:14:58,547 --> 01:15:00,500
Lou took me out into the
brush and kicked me out.

996
01:15:01,483 --> 01:15:03,518
And you came back in my car

997
01:15:03,553 --> 01:15:05,677
and you called out for me,
trying to lure me into your trap.

998
01:15:05,701 --> 01:15:08,237
You came back where Lou had left me

999
01:15:08,351 --> 01:15:10,286
Oh, is that why
you went back there, Ray?

1000
01:15:17,935 --> 01:15:20,766
- You're fucking crazy!
- Tell him what we found there, Tony.

1001
01:15:21,723 --> 01:15:24,680
- You tell him.
- Do I have to? Don't you know, Ray?

1002
01:15:27,636 --> 01:15:29,771
Y'all are crazy. It's crazy.

1003
01:15:29,806 --> 01:15:32,409
The bodies of my wife and child

1004
01:15:33,755 --> 01:15:37,442
which you took back there and dumped.

1005
01:15:39,474 --> 01:15:42,244
You're the one. I know you.

1006
01:15:42,831 --> 01:15:44,766
What do you say, Ray?

1007
01:15:44,835 --> 01:15:47,308
You're crazy. You're making a big mistake.

1008
01:15:47,382 --> 01:15:49,952
Mmm. I don't think so.

1009
01:15:50,003 --> 01:15:53,771
I don't think so, Ray. Put
your hands out in front of you.

1010
01:15:53,881 --> 01:15:56,184
- You got no right.
- Got no right?

1011
01:15:56,265 --> 01:15:58,771
Rights, rights, rights.
You and your goddamn rights.

1012
01:15:58,852 --> 01:16:00,452
Speaking of rights, I
just wanna let you know

1013
01:16:00,476 --> 01:16:02,741
I'm recording this entire conversation.

1014
01:16:03,084 --> 01:16:05,187
There. You clear?

1015
01:16:05,342 --> 01:16:07,357
- Mmm-hmm.
- All right, let's go, Tony.

1016
01:16:10,692 --> 01:16:12,894
Now, we're going to
a place you might remember,

1017
01:16:12,929 --> 01:16:15,499
and you can help yourself
out by telling me about it.

1018
01:16:15,737 --> 01:16:17,373
But if you don't remember,

1019
01:16:17,559 --> 01:16:20,178
Tony does, all right?

1020
01:16:20,256 --> 01:16:22,498
Hey, I'm sorry you
lost your folks, man.

1021
01:16:22,558 --> 01:16:25,883
It's a shame. But I didn't
have nothin' to do with it.

1022
01:16:45,327 --> 01:16:47,429
- What's this place?
- You know this place.

1023
01:16:47,517 --> 01:16:49,612
- Honest to God, I don't.
- You wanna get out, Tony?

1024
01:16:49,667 --> 01:16:51,625
- Shall we have a look inside, Ray?
- What for?

1025
01:16:51,649 --> 01:16:53,009
Come on, let's take a look.

1026
01:17:07,998 --> 01:17:09,946
All right, all right.

1027
01:17:14,958 --> 01:17:16,825
Oh, you raped them on the bed, I suppose.

1028
01:17:16,913 --> 01:17:18,913
- I never raped nobody.
- Stop fucking around, Ray.

1029
01:17:18,977 --> 01:17:21,379
We seen your record. We know
about that girl in Lubbock.

1030
01:17:21,414 --> 01:17:23,801
The charges were dropped.
I never raped nobody.

1031
01:17:23,845 --> 01:17:24,938
I wanna know, Ray.

1032
01:17:26,821 --> 01:17:29,172
I wanna know the exact
story, what you did to them.

1033
01:17:31,528 --> 01:17:34,297
- You'll have to ask somebody else.
- I wanna know what they said.

1034
01:17:37,052 --> 01:17:38,622
I wanna know what my wife said

1035
01:17:38,685 --> 01:17:40,392
and I wanna know what my daughter said.

1036
01:17:50,787 --> 01:17:52,368
I wanna know how you killed them.

1037
01:17:53,420 --> 01:17:55,836
And I wanna know if they
knew it was happening to them.

1038
01:17:55,919 --> 01:17:57,574
I wanna know what they felt!

1039
01:18:01,197 --> 01:18:03,094
I wanna know if they hurt.

1040
01:18:07,002 --> 01:18:08,005
Answer me!

1041
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:11,001
Answer me!

1042
01:18:14,271 --> 01:18:16,503
Answer me, you fucking bastard!

1043
01:18:34,690 --> 01:18:35,692
Is it better?

1044
01:18:36,932 --> 01:18:39,352
You're gonna take this
the wrong way, but, um,

1045
01:18:40,088 --> 01:18:43,001
I think that you should write
about something other than yourself.

1046
01:18:47,137 --> 01:18:49,048
Nobody writes about
anything but themselves.

1047
01:18:49,084 --> 01:18:51,248
I just, my mind started to
wander when I was reading it,

1048
01:18:51,272 --> 01:18:53,389
and that's not good, right?

1049
01:18:53,456 --> 01:18:54,547
I don't know what to do. Maybe, you know,

1050
01:18:54,571 --> 01:18:56,329
maybe I don't have a book in me.

1051
01:18:56,410 --> 01:18:58,945
Maybe give yourself some
space. Just do something else.

1052
01:18:59,022 --> 01:18:59,932
- Can you not do that?
- What?

1053
01:18:59,989 --> 01:19:02,216
Because it... That makes me feel
like you don't believe in me.

1054
01:19:02,240 --> 01:19:04,985
- Edward, that's not what I said.
- No, you didn't say that.

1055
01:19:05,075 --> 01:19:06,337
But you're saying it with your face

1056
01:19:06,361 --> 01:19:07,774
and you're saying it when you sigh.

1057
01:19:07,824 --> 01:19:10,405
Whatever, you're saying it when you
say you want me to go back to school.

1058
01:19:10,429 --> 01:19:11,912
Well, yeah, I do want
you to go back to school.

1059
01:19:11,936 --> 01:19:13,111
I don't see what's wrong with that.

1060
01:19:13,135 --> 01:19:14,593
I mean, I'm just being a realist.

1061
01:19:14,633 --> 01:19:17,555
I mean, you're gonna work at a
book store and just write a novel,

1062
01:19:17,599 --> 01:19:20,175
like that's what you
wanna do with your life?

1063
01:19:22,657 --> 01:19:25,994
I mean, that's really romantic,
but, like, what? This is it?

1064
01:19:26,115 --> 01:19:28,435
- This is it? This is what...
- You sound like your mother.

1065
01:19:31,133 --> 01:19:35,104
Well, you always said that I
reminded you so much of her, so...

1066
01:19:35,451 --> 01:19:37,391
You know, this is exactly why
I don't wanna read your work

1067
01:19:37,415 --> 01:19:39,250
because you always get
so fucking defensive.

1068
01:19:39,320 --> 01:19:41,052
Yeah, of course I'm defensive!

1069
01:19:41,188 --> 01:19:44,258
Do you know what it feels like to put
yourself out on the line creatively

1070
01:19:44,293 --> 01:19:47,516
and then have someone you love tell
you that they don't understand it?

1071
01:19:47,570 --> 01:19:49,548
No, I don't, because I'm not creative...

1072
01:19:49,583 --> 01:19:51,303
That's because
you choose not to be.

1073
01:19:54,209 --> 01:19:57,314
I don't wanna fight.
I'm tired and I'm edgy.

1074
01:19:57,349 --> 01:20:00,623
I've been writing all night. I just
wanted you to like it, all right?

1075
01:20:09,038 --> 01:20:10,039
Thanks.

1076
01:20:20,916 --> 01:20:22,997
<i>I got some news
you're not gonna like.</i>

1077
01:20:23,932 --> 01:20:25,923
They're letting Ray Marcus go.

1078
01:20:25,958 --> 01:20:28,056
<i>What? What do you
mean, they're letting him go?</i>

1079
01:20:28,636 --> 01:20:31,167
The D.A. says we don't
have enough hard evidence,

1080
01:20:31,281 --> 01:20:32,966
what we have is circumstantial.

1081
01:20:33,683 --> 01:20:35,564
He needs corroboration.

1082
01:20:38,840 --> 01:20:40,406
I'm real sorry, Tony.

1083
01:20:41,884 --> 01:20:43,494
It's a goddamn shame.

1084
01:20:45,307 --> 01:20:47,027
At least you got to lay a good belt on him.

1085
01:20:47,072 --> 01:20:50,132
<i>No, that's not enough.
What else can we do?</i>

1086
01:20:51,686 --> 01:20:52,956
I can think of something.

1087
01:20:54,262 --> 01:20:55,832
You'd better get here quick, though.

1088
01:20:55,917 --> 01:20:57,603
He ain't gonna stick around for long.

1089
01:20:58,285 --> 01:20:59,839
<i>Okay, all right, I'm leaving now.</i>

1090
01:21:03,705 --> 01:21:04,706
What?

1091
01:21:06,108 --> 01:21:09,877
I told you, I got lung
cancer. It's metastasized.

1092
01:21:10,874 --> 01:21:14,431
- But you smoke all the time.
- Yeah, well, that's how it works.

1093
01:21:14,936 --> 01:21:17,263
What's the point in quitting
now? I'll be dead in a year.

1094
01:21:17,333 --> 01:21:19,169
It's this fella named Jenks.

1095
01:21:19,240 --> 01:21:21,136
He's the lawyer the
court appointed for Ray.

1096
01:21:21,196 --> 01:21:23,472
He's a little smartass from Dallas.

1097
01:21:23,819 --> 01:21:26,732
He and the D.A. made a deal
and Ray got off. Politics.

1098
01:21:26,793 --> 01:21:28,836
When did you tell me you were sick?

1099
01:21:28,871 --> 01:21:30,941
See, they're trying to force me out.

1100
01:21:31,046 --> 01:21:33,452
They already got another
fella lined up for the job.

1101
01:21:33,542 --> 01:21:34,773
I don't understand what
you're talking about.

1102
01:21:34,797 --> 01:21:36,537
They'd drop a murder case to do that?

1103
01:21:36,620 --> 01:21:40,714
Oh, yeah. Give 'em the reason, ammunition.

1104
01:21:41,197 --> 01:21:44,867
They said my case wasn't well-prepared,
was a sloppy job, slapdash,

1105
01:21:44,902 --> 01:21:47,873
no evidence and evidence
improperly gathered,

1106
01:21:48,001 --> 01:21:49,383
won't stand up in court.

1107
01:21:51,159 --> 01:21:55,098
The D.A.'s too much of a chickenshit
to take a case he might lose.

1108
01:21:58,653 --> 01:22:00,092
They're not dropping Lou.

1109
01:22:02,770 --> 01:22:05,483
Well, it's no fucking
good if we don't get Ray.

1110
01:22:06,977 --> 01:22:08,873
Good.

1111
01:22:08,964 --> 01:22:10,993
That's what I was hoping you'd say.

1112
01:22:11,733 --> 01:22:16,205
They want me to retire and enjoy the
benefits of my cancer somewhere else.

1113
01:22:16,264 --> 01:22:18,800
- Fuck that.
- You never told me about the cancer.

1114
01:22:18,841 --> 01:22:20,606
The problem with Ray is his alibi.

1115
01:22:20,647 --> 01:22:21,783
You have a family?

1116
01:22:21,924 --> 01:22:24,227
- Ray claims he was with that little...
- Bobby. Bobby.

1117
01:22:24,912 --> 01:22:25,915
What?

1118
01:22:27,703 --> 01:22:29,591
Do you have anyone in your life?

1119
01:22:35,785 --> 01:22:38,288
No. No wife or...

1120
01:22:41,409 --> 01:22:43,356
I have a daughter in Corpus.

1121
01:22:47,201 --> 01:22:48,760
Has she been a help?

1122
01:22:52,915 --> 01:22:55,134
She doesn't know. What can she do about it?

1123
01:23:00,308 --> 01:23:02,152
Anyway, Ray claims

1124
01:23:02,238 --> 01:23:04,893
he was with that little girl,
Leila whatever her name is,

1125
01:23:04,943 --> 01:23:06,765
and she backs him up.

1126
01:23:06,835 --> 01:23:08,304
Her aunt backs her up.

1127
01:23:08,543 --> 01:23:09,802
What are we gonna do?

1128
01:23:12,689 --> 01:23:16,820
It's a question of how serious
you are about seeing justice done.

1129
01:23:19,140 --> 01:23:20,410
You get me?

1130
01:23:26,589 --> 01:23:29,110
I can't eat. Gonna throw up.

1131
01:23:29,189 --> 01:23:31,305
How are you gonna get
anything done if you can't eat?

1132
01:23:31,340 --> 01:23:34,714
Sometimes I can, sometimes I
can't. This place is terrible.

1133
01:23:34,776 --> 01:23:36,064
I need you to eat something.

1134
01:23:47,703 --> 01:23:49,833
So let me ask you a personal question.

1135
01:23:51,359 --> 01:23:53,382
Off the record, between you and me.

1136
01:23:54,451 --> 01:23:56,687
What do you want me to do with Ray Marcus?

1137
01:23:56,745 --> 01:23:58,447
Well, what can you do with him?

1138
01:23:58,507 --> 01:24:01,377
Anything you goddamn like.

1139
01:24:05,841 --> 01:24:09,278
But I thought you said that...

1140
01:24:09,464 --> 01:24:10,464
Listen,

1141
01:24:12,435 --> 01:24:14,305
I got nothin' to lose.

1142
01:24:14,340 --> 01:24:17,611
I'm not gonna let this asshole
D.A. fuck up my last case.

1143
01:24:17,799 --> 01:24:20,463
I'm also not gonna stand by
and watch a murderer go free.

1144
01:24:20,516 --> 01:24:25,027
I've seen too many sick fucks like
Ray Marcus get off over the years.

1145
01:24:25,554 --> 01:24:28,542
Now, are you willing to go outside
of strict procedure on this?

1146
01:24:28,577 --> 01:24:29,852
Yes.

1147
01:24:30,051 --> 01:24:31,454
- You sure?
- Yes.

1148
01:24:38,713 --> 01:24:39,734
Andes here.

1149
01:24:42,071 --> 01:24:44,286
You're kidding? All right, thanks.

1150
01:24:48,149 --> 01:24:50,319
Ray just showed up at Line Camp.

1151
01:24:51,385 --> 01:24:53,743
I'm gonna let that little
idiot get nice and liquored up

1152
01:24:53,811 --> 01:24:56,970
and then I'm gonna go grab his
ass and take him to my camp.

1153
01:24:57,665 --> 01:24:59,233
And I want you to come with me.

1154
01:24:59,350 --> 01:25:01,911
We're gonna keep him for a
little while, work him over a bit,

1155
01:25:01,943 --> 01:25:04,499
get a little rough, make him suffer.

1156
01:25:05,527 --> 01:25:07,574
And then we'll see what he does.

1157
01:25:09,256 --> 01:25:10,507
Would you like that?

1158
01:25:15,951 --> 01:25:19,555
<i>You have to realize
that this is not working.</i>

1159
01:25:19,614 --> 01:25:21,483
We are not working. We are too different.

1160
01:25:21,563 --> 01:25:24,152
- We are not right for each other.
- Susan, stop.

1161
01:25:24,800 --> 01:25:25,811
We're not right for each other?

1162
01:25:25,835 --> 01:25:27,181
No, we're not right for each other.

1163
01:25:27,205 --> 01:25:30,376
- We are perfect for each other.
- No, we're not perfect for each other, Edward.

1164
01:25:30,906 --> 01:25:32,539
We may be perfect for each other

1165
01:25:32,574 --> 01:25:34,034
if we didn't live in the real world,

1166
01:25:34,107 --> 01:25:37,147
but I live in the real world and I
need a life that is more structured.

1167
01:25:37,247 --> 01:25:38,851
- I need a future that is more structured.
- Hey.

1168
01:25:38,875 --> 01:25:41,883
I want to be the person that you
want me to be, but I just can't.

1169
01:25:41,918 --> 01:25:44,151
- You are. You are.
- I can't be that.

1170
01:25:44,239 --> 01:25:45,823
Hey, no, stop.

1171
01:25:45,867 --> 01:25:50,172
I, I really wanted to be this
person that you thought I was,

1172
01:25:50,207 --> 01:25:51,927
I really did, but I'm just not that person.

1173
01:25:51,962 --> 01:25:53,967
- I'm, I'm cynical, I'm pragmatic.
- No, look...

1174
01:25:54,002 --> 01:25:56,363
- No, I am. I'm a realist.
- You're afraid. You're afraid.

1175
01:25:56,450 --> 01:25:57,161
No, I'm not afraid.

1176
01:25:57,216 --> 01:25:59,478
- We've been through this so many times before.
- I'm not scared.

1177
01:25:59,502 --> 01:26:01,471
- I'm not scared. I'm unhappy.
- All right.

1178
01:26:05,475 --> 01:26:07,530
I'm just really, really unhappy.

1179
01:26:13,735 --> 01:26:14,804
You're so...

1180
01:26:16,172 --> 01:26:18,681
You really are so
wonderful and you're just so

1181
01:26:19,922 --> 01:26:22,036
sensitive and romantic and...

1182
01:26:22,125 --> 01:26:25,380
- Weak. That's right, yeah.
- What? I did not say you were weak.

1183
01:26:25,415 --> 01:26:27,638
- You've said it so many times before.
- I did not call you weak.

1184
01:26:27,662 --> 01:26:29,674
You've said it before, so
why don't you say it again?

1185
01:26:29,698 --> 01:26:31,867
- Weak.
- I did not say you were weak.

1186
01:26:31,901 --> 01:26:34,703
- I did not say you were weak.
- Do you love me?

1187
01:26:34,769 --> 01:26:36,614
- That's not the point.
- No, that is the point.

1188
01:26:36,638 --> 01:26:37,975
- No, it is not the point.
- That is the point!

1189
01:26:37,999 --> 01:26:39,879
- That is not the point.
- You didn't answer me.

1190
01:26:42,658 --> 01:26:44,933
- Yes, I love you.
- Well, when you love someone,

1191
01:26:46,014 --> 01:26:47,310
you work it out.

1192
01:26:47,942 --> 01:26:49,945
You don't just throw it away.

1193
01:26:50,085 --> 01:26:51,387
You have to be careful with it.

1194
01:26:51,487 --> 01:26:53,020
You might never get it again.

1195
01:26:54,188 --> 01:26:56,554
I can't do this with you anymore, Edward.

1196
01:26:57,171 --> 01:26:59,480
I just can't keep doing this.

1197
01:27:00,255 --> 01:27:01,255
Susan...

1198
01:27:02,317 --> 01:27:04,197
You can't just walk away from things

1199
01:27:04,272 --> 01:27:05,641
<i>all the time.</i>

1200
01:27:15,431 --> 01:27:18,034
- Come on. Come on.
- Oh, shit. Come on.

1201
01:27:18,089 --> 01:27:21,165
I told you, I don't know
nothin' about this situation.

1202
01:27:21,200 --> 01:27:22,612
Why don't you go ask in there, man?

1203
01:27:22,647 --> 01:27:24,298
I'll see you in a minute, okay?

1204
01:27:25,433 --> 01:27:26,434
Okay, sweetie?

1205
01:27:39,067 --> 01:27:40,900
We're going to my camp.

1206
01:27:41,883 --> 01:27:45,470
It's in White Creek near the
trailer where they took your folks.

1207
01:27:45,961 --> 01:27:47,129
You follow.

1208
01:28:02,858 --> 01:28:03,858
Sit up.

1209
01:28:08,231 --> 01:28:11,323
Oh, Jesus. I'm gonna be
sick. Tony, get over here, quick.

1210
01:28:11,738 --> 01:28:13,574
Here, you use this, right?

1211
01:28:13,709 --> 01:28:15,589
You shoot him if he gets out of line.

1212
01:28:24,404 --> 01:28:25,915
Boo.

1213
01:28:25,981 --> 01:28:28,083
Hey, man, this ain't
legal. If this were legal,

1214
01:28:28,150 --> 01:28:30,728
you'd have taken me to the
station, not this fucking place.

1215
01:28:30,871 --> 01:28:32,729
It's all the legal we need, boy.

1216
01:28:36,479 --> 01:28:38,848
- There ain't no new evidence.
- Oh, yeah?

1217
01:28:38,994 --> 01:28:42,238
Why don't you take me in if
you got new evidence? Huh?

1218
01:28:43,063 --> 01:28:45,427
I like it better here. It's more relaxed.

1219
01:28:47,042 --> 01:28:49,678
It seems to me you
tried this trick already.

1220
01:28:49,752 --> 01:28:51,272
If you think this guy's
gonna break me down,

1221
01:28:51,296 --> 01:28:53,308
- you already seen that don't work.
- Oh, yeah,

1222
01:28:54,110 --> 01:28:55,675
but what would you say if I told you

1223
01:28:55,770 --> 01:28:57,675
your friend Lou Bates implicated you

1224
01:28:57,719 --> 01:28:59,520
in the Hastings murders?

1225
01:29:00,662 --> 01:29:02,672
If Lou had done that, you
would have taken me in.

1226
01:29:02,766 --> 01:29:05,602
Well, don't worry, we'll
get you to the station.

1227
01:29:05,720 --> 01:29:07,936
Don't worry. Oh, who's this?

1228
01:29:10,012 --> 01:29:12,581
- Well, looky here.
- You son of a bitch.

1229
01:29:13,414 --> 01:29:14,716
All right.

1230
01:29:15,456 --> 01:29:18,208
Okay, come on, boy. Get over there.

1231
01:29:18,819 --> 01:29:21,044
- Lou, what'd you fucking tell this guy?
- I didn't tell him nothin'.

1232
01:29:21,068 --> 01:29:23,816
No, he said you told him I was the
one who killed this guy's wife and kid.

1233
01:29:23,840 --> 01:29:25,714
What? That's what he told me about you.

1234
01:29:26,120 --> 01:29:28,640
You're supposed to be the lawman.
What kind of bullshit is this?

1235
01:29:28,711 --> 01:29:29,712
Fuck off

1236
01:29:30,278 --> 01:29:31,825
both of you.

1237
01:29:31,920 --> 01:29:35,336
Now, do you two have any last
words you wanna say to each other?

1238
01:29:38,466 --> 01:29:40,201
I think what we should do, Tony,

1239
01:29:40,236 --> 01:29:41,957
is we should just kill them right now.

1240
01:29:42,924 --> 01:29:44,978
It's gonna be rough for 'em out there,

1241
01:29:45,726 --> 01:29:47,890
not knowing how it's gonna come.

1242
01:29:48,509 --> 01:29:52,228
Maybe Ray'll get killed
for resisting arrest, huh?

1243
01:29:57,813 --> 01:29:59,889
Coming home late at night,

1244
01:30:01,277 --> 01:30:03,361
he might get shot by a burglar.

1245
01:30:08,226 --> 01:30:09,899
Oh, you feeling uncomfortable, boy?

1246
01:30:10,853 --> 01:30:13,225
Ooh. Come on up here.

1247
01:30:14,294 --> 01:30:16,464
Yeah, you look like you're
feeling uncomfortable.

1248
01:30:17,449 --> 01:30:18,771
- What?
- Sorry. I'm sorry.

1249
01:30:18,827 --> 01:30:19,827
What's that?

1250
01:30:21,149 --> 01:30:22,893
I ain't gonna kill you, son.

1251
01:30:23,103 --> 01:30:24,205
I'm a policeman.

1252
01:30:26,140 --> 01:30:27,573
What, you gonna cry?

1253
01:30:27,755 --> 01:30:29,224
Are you gonna cry?

1254
01:30:30,846 --> 01:30:35,190
Aw, okay. Well, since you're
feeling so uncomfortable...

1255
01:30:35,272 --> 01:30:36,474
Tony, get over here.

1256
01:30:37,112 --> 01:30:38,247
Take this.

1257
01:30:39,421 --> 01:30:41,140
- Go on, right here, okay?
- Please don't.

1258
01:30:41,193 --> 01:30:43,370
- Fuck.
- Right here, right here.

1259
01:30:43,484 --> 01:30:45,251
Right here, okay?

1260
01:30:45,343 --> 01:30:46,539
- Right.
- Hey, hey.

1261
01:30:46,627 --> 01:30:48,797
What about me? I might be
feeling uncomfortable too.

1262
01:30:49,436 --> 01:30:50,498
Oh, yeah?

1263
01:30:51,026 --> 01:30:52,595
Okay, come on up.

1264
01:30:55,523 --> 01:30:58,207
There you go. Free as a bird.

1265
01:30:58,679 --> 01:31:00,982
Okay? How about it?

1266
01:31:01,170 --> 01:31:04,127
What do you say, Tony? Now,
what shall we do with these two?

1267
01:31:06,145 --> 01:31:07,309
What you gonna do?

1268
01:31:08,310 --> 01:31:09,978
What you gonna do, son?

1269
01:31:11,372 --> 01:31:12,375
Come on.

1270
01:31:13,419 --> 01:31:14,655
Come on.

1271
01:31:19,473 --> 01:31:20,473
Let's go...

1272
01:31:20,532 --> 01:31:21,622
He's got a gun.

1273
01:31:22,550 --> 01:31:24,839
- Bobby?
- Shoot 'em, Tony. Shoot 'em.

1274
01:31:24,980 --> 01:31:26,714
Come back here, you little fuckers!

1275
01:31:47,790 --> 01:31:50,166
No. No.

1276
01:31:51,779 --> 01:31:52,779
No, please.

1277
01:32:23,611 --> 01:32:25,013
Are you okay?

1278
01:32:27,403 --> 01:32:29,529
I'm gonna live to regret this.

1279
01:32:32,239 --> 01:32:33,742
I regret it now.

1280
01:32:36,430 --> 01:32:39,356
You know, I'm Catholic. I
don't even believe in abortions.

1281
01:32:41,249 --> 01:32:42,441
I'm so sorry.

1282
01:32:43,917 --> 01:32:45,549
I feel so useless.

1283
01:32:48,069 --> 01:32:51,244
You're anything but useless. You
always know exactly what to do.

1284
01:32:52,754 --> 01:32:53,756
Thank you.

1285
01:32:59,985 --> 01:33:02,285
I just don't think I'm ever gonna
be able to look at Edward again

1286
01:33:02,309 --> 01:33:04,011
after what I did to his child.

1287
01:33:04,159 --> 01:33:05,674
He'll never find out.

1288
01:33:13,607 --> 01:33:16,311
What did I do? What did I do?

1289
01:33:16,735 --> 01:33:18,540
I promise it'll be okay.

1290
01:33:19,721 --> 01:33:21,216
I'll make it okay.

1291
01:33:28,690 --> 01:33:30,026
Oh, my God, no.

1292
01:33:36,151 --> 01:33:37,319
Edward.

1293
01:33:42,811 --> 01:33:43,946
Tony.

1294
01:33:45,134 --> 01:33:46,134
Mmm.

1295
01:33:47,475 --> 01:33:48,475
Hey.

1296
01:33:50,458 --> 01:33:52,427
You know I had to shoot him, right?

1297
01:33:55,384 --> 01:33:59,155
I don't give a goddamn
fuck that you shot him!

1298
01:33:59,214 --> 01:34:00,581
I'm glad that you shot him!

1299
01:34:00,648 --> 01:34:03,114
I'm fucking glad that he's dead!

1300
01:34:10,452 --> 01:34:12,252
I should have stopped it!

1301
01:34:14,843 --> 01:34:16,018
I should have protected them.

1302
01:34:16,091 --> 01:34:17,940
I should have seen it coming.

1303
01:34:19,215 --> 01:34:20,565
I should have stopped it.

1304
01:34:20,600 --> 01:34:21,847
Hey, now. Hey, now.

1305
01:34:21,902 --> 01:34:23,037
I should have stopped it.

1306
01:34:23,111 --> 01:34:24,196
Shh.

1307
01:34:25,746 --> 01:34:27,573
- It's okay.
- I should have stopped it.

1308
01:34:27,644 --> 01:34:28,913
It's okay.

1309
01:34:29,745 --> 01:34:30,980
Hey.

1310
01:34:32,046 --> 01:34:33,414
You're okay.

1311
01:34:33,673 --> 01:34:35,891
I should have stopped it, Bobby.

1312
01:34:36,143 --> 01:34:37,143
Look at me.

1313
01:34:38,498 --> 01:34:39,967
You're a good man.

1314
01:34:42,543 --> 01:34:43,979
You're a good man.

1315
01:34:50,105 --> 01:34:52,374
Come on. We gotta get up.

1316
01:34:52,467 --> 01:34:54,187
Ray gets to the road, he's gonna hitchhike.

1317
01:34:54,224 --> 01:34:55,958
We gotta catch him before he gets a ride.

1318
01:34:56,046 --> 01:34:56,978
Now, listen to me.

1319
01:34:57,039 --> 01:34:59,459
When you get to the fork in
the road, you veer to the left.

1320
01:34:59,494 --> 01:35:01,791
That's gonna take you back
towards where he took your folks.

1321
01:35:01,815 --> 01:35:03,979
I suspect he's gonna go for the highway.

1322
01:35:04,076 --> 01:35:05,806
I'll go that direction.

1323
01:35:05,856 --> 01:35:08,393
You take this. I got
another one in the car.

1324
01:35:08,951 --> 01:35:10,358
- Bobby...
- What?

1325
01:35:11,733 --> 01:35:13,345
Are you in trouble for all this?

1326
01:35:14,788 --> 01:35:18,524
Hell, I don't know. I
don't really give a shit.

1327
01:35:18,658 --> 01:35:20,627
I'm dying, remember?

1328
01:37:05,103 --> 01:37:06,105
Fuck.

1329
01:37:06,485 --> 01:37:08,555
You. Where's your pal?

1330
01:37:08,803 --> 01:37:10,172
He's on his way.

1331
01:37:12,214 --> 01:37:13,534
Your cop friends?

1332
01:37:17,150 --> 01:37:18,306
They're around.

1333
01:37:20,715 --> 01:37:21,717
They here?

1334
01:37:24,557 --> 01:37:26,243
It's just me for the moment.

1335
01:37:27,563 --> 01:37:28,564
Oh.

1336
01:37:29,824 --> 01:37:32,835
You and that fucking gun
you don't know how to use.

1337
01:37:35,531 --> 01:37:36,962
What happened to Lou?

1338
01:37:38,953 --> 01:37:39,851
He's dead.

1339
01:37:39,924 --> 01:37:41,600
What?

1340
01:37:41,742 --> 01:37:43,773
Fucking son of a bitch.

1341
01:37:43,805 --> 01:37:46,306
That's big trouble for your
friend, you know that, right?

1342
01:37:47,707 --> 01:37:48,707
I don't think so.

1343
01:37:48,741 --> 01:37:50,176
You don't think so?

1344
01:37:51,104 --> 01:37:52,935
Well, then, what the fuck do you want?

1345
01:37:55,110 --> 01:37:57,054
You and that silly gun.

1346
01:37:58,653 --> 01:38:00,479
I've seen how handy
you are with that thing.

1347
01:38:00,581 --> 01:38:02,185
Sit down. Sit down.

1348
01:38:03,810 --> 01:38:05,821
You sit down or I'll fucking kill you.

1349
01:38:11,730 --> 01:38:13,466
Listen, man...

1350
01:38:15,836 --> 01:38:18,146
Why does a nice guy like you

1351
01:38:18,211 --> 01:38:22,138
hang out with a guy like
Andes who kills people?

1352
01:38:23,644 --> 01:38:24,989
You kill people.

1353
01:38:32,140 --> 01:38:35,566
They had it coming to 'em, your
fucking wife and that kid, but you...

1354
01:38:35,777 --> 01:38:37,816
You got me wrong, it was an accident.

1355
01:38:37,851 --> 01:38:39,465
It was an accident?

1356
01:38:39,500 --> 01:38:42,653
I got a certain pride
in how people talk to me.

1357
01:38:43,684 --> 01:38:46,075
There are certain things
I don't put up with.

1358
01:38:46,833 --> 01:38:49,676
When someone accuses me of something,

1359
01:38:49,711 --> 01:38:51,679
that's a fucking insult.

1360
01:38:52,847 --> 01:38:54,596
It gives me the right.

1361
01:38:55,455 --> 01:38:58,545
If my woman accuses me
of fucking somebody else,

1362
01:38:58,606 --> 01:39:01,036
well, then, I'll go fuck somebody else.

1363
01:39:02,884 --> 01:39:06,081
If your daughter thinks I'm
a rapist, then she gets raped.

1364
01:39:10,732 --> 01:39:13,936
Nobody gets away with
what you did to us. Nobody.

1365
01:39:15,215 --> 01:39:16,160
Nobody.

1366
01:39:16,229 --> 01:39:17,565
They don't?

1367
01:39:17,730 --> 01:39:18,733
Nobody.

1368
01:39:21,081 --> 01:39:22,116
Nobody.

1369
01:39:23,498 --> 01:39:24,872
Nobody.

1370
01:39:24,907 --> 01:39:26,845
Well, then, you should just kill me, then.

1371
01:39:28,570 --> 01:39:29,705
Right?

1372
01:39:30,857 --> 01:39:32,494
You should fucking kill me.

1373
01:39:36,724 --> 01:39:38,393
Man, you know nothing.

1374
01:39:40,494 --> 01:39:42,505
It's fun to kill people.

1375
01:39:43,124 --> 01:39:45,719
You of all people should try it sometime.

1376
01:39:45,754 --> 01:39:46,755
Fun?

1377
01:39:50,098 --> 01:39:51,794
It's fun to kill people?

1378
01:39:56,750 --> 01:39:57,575
Did you have fun

1379
01:39:57,610 --> 01:39:59,104
killing my wife and daughter?

1380
01:40:02,569 --> 01:40:03,569
Get up.

1381
01:40:04,700 --> 01:40:06,482
Get up. Go on, now.

1382
01:40:06,536 --> 01:40:08,195
Go on. Go on.

1383
01:40:10,070 --> 01:40:11,272
Go on.

1384
01:40:13,166 --> 01:40:14,168
Go on.

1385
01:40:27,335 --> 01:40:29,771
I remember your fucking wife.

1386
01:40:29,804 --> 01:40:33,913
I remember fucking your wife.

1387
01:40:35,382 --> 01:40:37,030
You're too weak.

1388
01:40:37,612 --> 01:40:40,339
Too fucking weak, you know.

1389
01:40:40,681 --> 01:40:43,649
You're too weak to do anything about it.

1390
01:40:46,293 --> 01:40:48,150
Son of a bitch!

1391
01:44:59,734 --> 01:45:00,920
Edward.

1392
01:45:23,756 --> 01:45:26,136
_

1393
01:45:28,927 --> 01:45:31,273
_

1394
01:48:00,040 --> 01:48:01,409
Right this way, sir.

1395
