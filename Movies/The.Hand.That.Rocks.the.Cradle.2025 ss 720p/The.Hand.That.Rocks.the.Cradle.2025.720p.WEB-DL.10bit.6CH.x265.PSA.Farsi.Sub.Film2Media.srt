1
00:02:03,542 --> 00:02:05,062
I'm sorry. Okay. Keep going.

2
00:02:07,125 --> 00:02:08,917
Well, then things got really bad.

3
00:02:09,833 --> 00:02:12,708
The family that I was nannying for,
they had to move.

4
00:02:12,792 --> 00:02:14,917
And that's what you do?
You're in child care?

5
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,667
Yeah. Well, that's what I love.

6
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:21,625
Um, I was going to school for it.
Uh, early education.

7
00:02:21,708 --> 00:02:23,833
But then, you know, losing this job,

8
00:02:23,917 --> 00:02:25,583
uh, it's just really hard financially.

9
00:02:25,667 --> 00:02:27,125
Yeah, for sure.

10
00:02:27,208 --> 00:02:29,292
But then I get this email
from my landlord saying,

11
00:02:29,375 --> 00:02:31,208
"We're raising your rent. Good day."

12
00:02:31,292 --> 00:02:32,583
I'm glad you came today.

13
00:02:33,542 --> 00:02:37,083
You know, cases like yours are
exactly why my firm does these events.

14
00:02:41,125 --> 00:02:44,708
So, this is what you do?
Pick fights with landlords?

15
00:02:44,792 --> 00:02:48,708
My firm handles all kinds of housing
and real estate issues.

16
00:02:50,042 --> 00:02:52,625
Keeping landlords honest, we do that...

17
00:02:52,708 --> 00:02:53,917
We do that pro bono.

18
00:02:55,958 --> 00:02:57,958
It's like a perk.

19
00:02:59,167 --> 00:03:00,417
Um...

20
00:03:07,042 --> 00:03:08,458
So, what are you doing here?

21
00:03:09,542 --> 00:03:11,042
What do you mean?

22
00:03:11,875 --> 00:03:13,083
You're about to pop.

23
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:17,500
Shouldn't you be home
drinking raspberry tea?

24
00:03:18,333 --> 00:03:22,500
Well, that sounds very nice,
but, um, I'm managing.

25
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:24,750
People do it.

26
00:03:32,583 --> 00:03:36,042
LA Law. There she goes.

27
00:03:36,125 --> 00:03:37,125
Hi, Henry.

28
00:03:43,333 --> 00:03:47,875
Please, Daddy.
I promise that Mama's home. I promise.

29
00:03:55,625 --> 00:03:57,958
-Hi, Caitlin.
-Hey, Alison.

30
00:03:58,042 --> 00:04:00,417
Um, where's the contract? I need it.

31
00:04:01,417 --> 00:04:03,042
He says he's still proofreading.

32
00:04:03,625 --> 00:04:04,833
I can call him again.

33
00:04:06,375 --> 00:04:07,500
Uh...

34
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:10,750
I-I think we're gonna
have to pick this up later.

35
00:04:10,833 --> 00:04:13,125
Oh. Is everything okay?

36
00:04:13,208 --> 00:04:15,458
Uh, yeah. Um...

37
00:04:15,542 --> 00:04:17,208
Yeah, I just think I'm going into labor.

38
00:04:17,292 --> 00:04:18,500
Oh.

39
00:04:27,917 --> 00:04:30,042
Just tell me. How are they not real?

40
00:04:30,125 --> 00:04:32,542
-Where are my keys?
-Mom?

41
00:04:32,625 --> 00:04:35,125
-Earth to Mom.
-Can you hold this a second?

42
00:04:36,042 --> 00:04:37,042
Mom.

43
00:04:37,125 --> 00:04:38,875
-What, the baby animals?
-Yeah.

44
00:04:38,958 --> 00:04:41,083
-Because they're in a video game.
-It costs money.

45
00:04:41,167 --> 00:04:42,875
Why would they cost money
if they're not real?

46
00:04:42,958 --> 00:04:44,542
Yeah, that's exactly my question.

47
00:04:50,167 --> 00:04:52,750
Let's make some space.

48
00:04:52,833 --> 00:04:54,208
Mom, this is serious to me.

49
00:04:54,292 --> 00:04:55,667
I know, honey. I know.

50
00:04:55,750 --> 00:04:57,750
I know.
You're saying it's serious to you.

51
00:04:57,833 --> 00:04:59,250
And I get it. But we need to go.

52
00:04:59,333 --> 00:05:01,833
-Can you get in the car?
-I'm helping.

53
00:05:01,917 --> 00:05:04,917
Okay. There we go.

54
00:05:10,708 --> 00:05:13,208
-What are you doing?
-What are you doing?

55
00:05:13,292 --> 00:05:14,792
You leave your baby
in the street?

56
00:05:14,875 --> 00:05:17,250
You can't just
drive down here that fast.

57
00:05:17,333 --> 00:05:19,542
Oh, you're lucky that stroller
didn't damage my car.

58
00:05:19,625 --> 00:05:21,292
-Come on.
-Dumb bitch.

59
00:05:24,417 --> 00:05:26,667
Oh, come on.

60
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:29,750
-Are we ready to do this?
-Dad.

61
00:05:29,833 --> 00:05:31,667
-Jesus.
-What the hell?

62
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:34,292
-What happened?
-This woman...

63
00:05:34,375 --> 00:05:36,833
She just came speeding down here.

64
00:05:36,917 --> 00:05:38,875
-What a fucking idiot.
-Dad.

65
00:05:38,958 --> 00:05:42,333
What? If it's true, you can say "fuck."

66
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,583
There should be a stop sign there.

67
00:05:45,667 --> 00:05:48,500
-Yeah, well, LA.
-What does that mean?

68
00:05:49,042 --> 00:05:50,958
-People don't stop in LA.
-Oh...

69
00:05:54,167 --> 00:05:55,792
No, there should be a stop sign.

70
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Thank you.

71
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:03,167
Okay. Tomatoes...

72
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:08,875
Okay, we're not buying those today.

73
00:06:09,458 --> 00:06:11,792
Let's check out the apples over there.

74
00:06:13,042 --> 00:06:14,208
Hmm.

75
00:06:22,375 --> 00:06:23,417
Caitlin.

76
00:06:27,833 --> 00:06:30,042
-Polly. Yeah.
-Polly. Right.

77
00:06:30,125 --> 00:06:31,500
Wow. How are you?

78
00:06:32,042 --> 00:06:33,667
I'm good. Yeah, I'm good.

79
00:06:34,333 --> 00:06:36,083
What happened with your landlord?

80
00:06:36,167 --> 00:06:38,083
Um, I sent him a letter,

81
00:06:38,167 --> 00:06:40,667
but he said something about, you know,
the law with rent increase,

82
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:42,333
that unfortunately it doesn't apply.

83
00:06:42,417 --> 00:06:44,125
Well, he's wrong.

84
00:06:44,208 --> 00:06:46,292
-What you need to do is...
-It's fine.

85
00:06:46,375 --> 00:06:48,333
You know, I'm-I'm getting by.

86
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:50,250
Got pesto.

87
00:06:51,875 --> 00:06:55,083
Um, yeah, it has palm oil.

88
00:06:56,125 --> 00:06:57,125
Is that bad?

89
00:06:57,750 --> 00:07:01,292
Well, it's 50% saturated fat, so...

90
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:03,292
I thought fat was
a good thing now.

91
00:07:03,375 --> 00:07:06,083
It... There's different kinds.
Can you take it back?

92
00:07:06,167 --> 00:07:08,250
Sure. I just thought, for pasta, it'd...

93
00:07:08,333 --> 00:07:10,167
Mom.

94
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:13,250
-So, what's your plan, then, as far as...
-Mom? Mom.

95
00:07:13,333 --> 00:07:15,000
I'm speaking, Emma, okay?

96
00:07:15,083 --> 00:07:17,250
-Can we go now?
-We just got here.

97
00:07:17,333 --> 00:07:20,375
-I'm hungry. Mom.
-We're gonna get food, okay?

98
00:07:20,458 --> 00:07:21,583
Um...

99
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:27,250
If you ever needed a babysitter,
even just for an afternoon

100
00:07:27,333 --> 00:07:31,167
to really, you know,
nail the farmers' market...

101
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:34,583
-And you're in childcare?
-I am. Um...

102
00:07:34,667 --> 00:07:38,042
I had mentioned it, you know,
but that was a long time ago.

103
00:07:38,125 --> 00:07:39,375
I remember, yeah.

104
00:07:40,917 --> 00:07:42,750
Let me see if I have your number.

105
00:07:42,833 --> 00:07:43,833
Okay.

106
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:46,792
I mean,
she's had a rough go of it.

107
00:07:48,208 --> 00:07:53,958
It's just easier to talk to her than,
like, half the moms at Emma's school.

108
00:07:54,042 --> 00:07:56,542
She's just like an actual person.

109
00:07:57,750 --> 00:08:00,500
But she has experience with kids?

110
00:08:00,583 --> 00:08:02,792
Yeah. Yeah, I'll get a reference from her.

111
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:07,083
-Mom, not too short.
-I know. There you go.

112
00:08:07,167 --> 00:08:09,125
-And you said you wanted a break.
-I do.

113
00:08:09,208 --> 00:08:13,667
I could... I could go a bit easier
this time, and, um...

114
00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:16,667
take care of myself,
like everybody's always demanding.

115
00:08:20,375 --> 00:08:21,542
Okay.

116
00:08:24,208 --> 00:08:25,208
Okay.

117
00:08:30,417 --> 00:08:31,417
Right.

118
00:08:32,917 --> 00:08:34,583
What do you think?

119
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:38,750
Perfect.

120
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:40,750
Gold star.

121
00:08:40,833 --> 00:08:42,875
Ooh. Why, thank you.

122
00:08:52,333 --> 00:08:54,625
-Hello.
-Hi, Rosanna?

123
00:08:55,333 --> 00:08:58,000
-Uh, yes.
-Hi. My name's Caitlin.

124
00:08:58,083 --> 00:09:01,042
I... I got your number from Polly Murphy.

125
00:09:01,125 --> 00:09:04,083
-Oh. Hi.
-Hi. Yeah.

126
00:09:04,167 --> 00:09:06,208
We're considering hiring her as a nanny

127
00:09:06,292 --> 00:09:09,708
and I was just curious
about your experience with her.

128
00:09:09,792 --> 00:09:11,250
Oh, um...

129
00:09:12,042 --> 00:09:14,292
She's amazing.

130
00:09:14,375 --> 00:09:16,208
Really became a part of our family.

131
00:09:16,292 --> 00:09:18,083
That's great to hear.

132
00:09:18,167 --> 00:09:20,792
Sorry. How long
did she work for you?

133
00:09:22,542 --> 00:09:26,125
-Gosh, a couple of years.
-Uh-huh.

134
00:09:26,208 --> 00:09:28,125
Okay. Wow. That's great.

135
00:09:28,208 --> 00:09:30,625
That's a... That's a really long time.

136
00:09:30,708 --> 00:09:35,250
Yeah. Really wonderful with the kids.

137
00:09:46,292 --> 00:09:47,292
Hi.

138
00:09:50,333 --> 00:09:53,458
So, clean go here, and then
dirties straight in the dishwasher.

139
00:09:53,542 --> 00:09:55,667
-There's a sterilized cycle.
-Okay.

140
00:09:56,208 --> 00:09:57,500
And just glass bottles.

141
00:09:58,125 --> 00:10:00,000
Right. Hold on the micro plastics.

142
00:10:00,875 --> 00:10:05,958
Exactly. Yes, I know we're a lost cause,
but, you know, hopefully for them.

143
00:10:08,167 --> 00:10:10,000
Uh, okay. Here.

144
00:10:10,083 --> 00:10:13,208
-Oh, wow.
-Yeah, I've stocked up quite a lot.

145
00:10:13,292 --> 00:10:15,667
So we've got left to right,
older to newer.

146
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:18,667
-So you can just pull from the left.
-And no formula?

147
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:21,375
For... Oh. No, that stuff is just sugar.

148
00:10:21,458 --> 00:10:23,667
So once she has that... you know.

149
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:25,542
-Got it. Yeah.
-Okay.

150
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:27,208
Josie.

151
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,708
Josie, it's your new nanny, Polly.

152
00:10:29,792 --> 00:10:31,083
-Want to say hi?
-Hi.

153
00:10:31,167 --> 00:10:32,167
Hi.

154
00:10:34,917 --> 00:10:36,417
Mommy says no sugar.

155
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:37,542
Mommy says no sugar.

156
00:10:39,917 --> 00:10:41,292
Hi, baby.

157
00:10:41,417 --> 00:10:43,208
Hi baby.

158
00:11:18,292 --> 00:11:21,417
So, I think, um,
I'm gonna go run some errands.

159
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:22,667
Great. Yeah.

160
00:11:25,625 --> 00:11:26,750
Um...

161
00:11:27,708 --> 00:11:29,792
-We'll be fine.
-Right.

162
00:11:31,625 --> 00:11:32,625
Okay.

163
00:11:34,375 --> 00:11:35,458
Bye.

164
00:11:48,208 --> 00:11:52,792
♪ She talks to birds
She talks to angels ♪

165
00:11:52,875 --> 00:11:56,625

169
00:12:41,292 --> 00:12:43,500
-Hello.
-Hello.

170
00:12:43,583 --> 00:12:45,667
-Food's here.
-Great.

171
00:12:51,042 --> 00:12:53,542
-Josie's asleep, so I'm gonna head home.
-Great. Okay.

172
00:12:53,625 --> 00:12:55,375
Uh, do you want dinner?

173
00:12:55,458 --> 00:12:57,375
-Yeah.
-I mean, there's plenty.

174
00:12:58,458 --> 00:12:59,542
Please, stay.

175
00:13:01,417 --> 00:13:03,667
-Stay.
-Okay.

176
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:05,250
I'll go get another plate.

177
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,333
Here you go.

178
00:13:07,417 --> 00:13:08,542
Oh, I don't drink.

179
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:12,583
Cool. Um, my love.

180
00:13:13,458 --> 00:13:15,833
Great. Thank you. Okay.

181
00:13:16,917 --> 00:13:19,083
All right. This looks good.

182
00:13:19,167 --> 00:13:22,000
-Emma, you want the chicken?
-Have whatever you want, just dig in.

183
00:13:22,083 --> 00:13:23,333
Okay.

184
00:13:30,417 --> 00:13:31,500
I need space!

185
00:13:31,583 --> 00:13:33,167
Emma...

186
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:35,625
You can have space,
but you cannot speak to me in that...

187
00:13:35,708 --> 00:13:37,250
My God! Leave me alone!

188
00:13:39,542 --> 00:13:41,292
Should you just give her a second?

189
00:13:43,375 --> 00:13:46,042
Yeah.

190
00:13:46,917 --> 00:13:50,042
She thinks I'm this controlling,
like, scold.

191
00:13:50,708 --> 00:13:53,500
It's 'cause all the other parents
are scared of their own kids.

192
00:13:53,583 --> 00:13:54,875
I see that a lot.

193
00:13:56,208 --> 00:14:00,167
Emma's smart, but she is super willful.

194
00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:03,250
Ever since she was a baby,
if I set her down even for one second,

195
00:14:03,333 --> 00:14:05,083
she would just scream.

196
00:14:05,167 --> 00:14:08,000
-Scream.
-Sounds so hard.

197
00:14:12,333 --> 00:14:15,875
Yeah, that first year was,
um, was something.

198
00:14:21,958 --> 00:14:24,208
Hey, you know what?
Don't let me keep you. Really.

199
00:14:24,292 --> 00:14:27,000
-If you need to...
-Oh. No, it's just, um...

200
00:14:28,542 --> 00:14:29,667
this girl.

201
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:31,375
We've been sort of talking.

202
00:14:32,458 --> 00:14:35,208
Oh, yeah? You like her?

203
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:37,833
I'm not sure yet.

204
00:14:40,542 --> 00:14:41,583
It's, um...

205
00:14:42,167 --> 00:14:45,000
It's funny. I was dating a woman
when I met Miguel.

206
00:14:46,458 --> 00:14:47,875
I think I could tell that.

207
00:14:51,292 --> 00:14:52,542
Really?

208
00:14:52,625 --> 00:14:53,708
About me?

209
00:14:54,583 --> 00:14:57,333
Yeah. You have that vibe to you.

210
00:15:03,333 --> 00:15:05,833
-I think this is going back.
-I like it.

211
00:15:08,333 --> 00:15:09,417
Do you want it?

212
00:15:10,083 --> 00:15:12,292
I mean, maybe it looks better on you.

213
00:15:15,250 --> 00:15:16,333
Okay.

214
00:15:19,333 --> 00:15:20,333
Let's see.

215
00:15:21,083 --> 00:15:22,292
Oh, yeah.

216
00:15:26,333 --> 00:15:28,042
I'm sorry. Is that weird? I...

217
00:15:28,125 --> 00:15:31,000
No. No, I... I love it.

218
00:15:38,833 --> 00:15:40,750
You know what?
Um, I'll grab you some scissors.

219
00:15:40,833 --> 00:15:41,875
Cut the tag.

220
00:16:35,042 --> 00:16:36,333
Miguel, um,

221
00:16:37,292 --> 00:16:39,125
can we try tonight?

222
00:16:39,833 --> 00:16:41,833
Maybe? I'm just not... I'm not...

223
00:16:44,333 --> 00:16:46,458
-Right now.
-Okay.

224
00:16:50,792 --> 00:16:54,125
I'm sorry. I've missed you, too, you know?

225
00:16:55,667 --> 00:16:57,875
I've missed you, too.
It's just Josie, and...

226
00:16:58,625 --> 00:16:59,750
It's fine.

227
00:17:00,250 --> 00:17:01,333
It's okay.

228
00:17:14,250 --> 00:17:18,333
Oh, you know what, I have that, um...
stop sign meeting this afternoon.

229
00:17:19,042 --> 00:17:20,125
Mm-hmm.

230
00:17:21,208 --> 00:17:23,333
Could you take Emma to basketball?

231
00:17:24,083 --> 00:17:26,167
I can't. I'm meeting with the builders.

232
00:17:27,583 --> 00:17:28,583
Okay.

233
00:17:29,958 --> 00:17:31,875
Why don't you ask Polly to take her?

234
00:17:31,958 --> 00:17:33,083
It's walking distance.

235
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,042
Oh, yeah.

236
00:17:35,708 --> 00:17:36,708
Okay.

237
00:17:43,458 --> 00:17:45,000
I have a surprise for you.

238
00:17:53,208 --> 00:17:55,458
-Don't tell.
-I won't.

239
00:17:59,875 --> 00:18:02,875
Do you want some, Josie? I bet you do.

240
00:18:04,333 --> 00:18:06,333
Here. Mm.

241
00:18:09,625 --> 00:18:10,750
Give her some.

242
00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:14,083
It's so much sugar.

243
00:18:14,208 --> 00:18:15,542
It's good for you.

244
00:18:24,167 --> 00:18:26,458
Mm.

245
00:18:27,667 --> 00:18:29,167
Did your mom let you eat sugar?

246
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:30,333
She did.

247
00:18:31,875 --> 00:18:33,250
She made the best cupcakes.

248
00:18:36,583 --> 00:18:39,042
But before I got too old,
she had to go away.

249
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:42,042
But your dad could stay?

250
00:18:43,333 --> 00:18:44,417
Nope.

251
00:18:47,417 --> 00:18:48,667
The place I went to live,

252
00:18:49,417 --> 00:18:51,792
the only thing they had to eat
was tuna fish.

253
00:18:51,875 --> 00:18:54,375
-That's silly.
-It is.

254
00:18:55,542 --> 00:18:57,333
But it gets even sillier than that.

255
00:18:58,792 --> 00:19:01,583
There was no mayonnaise, no lettuce,

256
00:19:02,625 --> 00:19:03,750
no bread even.

257
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,917
I had to eat the tuna
out of a can, like a cat.

258
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:12,375
And when there was no more left...

259
00:19:18,250 --> 00:19:19,833
there was nothing left to eat.

260
00:19:34,375 --> 00:19:37,792
Whoa! Whoo!

261
00:19:37,875 --> 00:19:39,167
Whee!

262
00:19:39,250 --> 00:19:41,625
Whoa!

263
00:19:42,375 --> 00:19:43,750
Oh, my goodness.

264
00:19:43,833 --> 00:19:46,250
Whoa. Wow.

265
00:20:02,667 --> 00:20:03,833
She's so beautiful.

266
00:20:10,417 --> 00:20:11,500
She is.

267
00:20:16,333 --> 00:20:17,417
Ready?

268
00:20:27,167 --> 00:20:30,125
Emergency.
There's smoke in the kitchen.

269
00:20:30,208 --> 00:20:32,750
-Smoke alarm detected in the kitchen.
-Okay.

270
00:20:36,667 --> 00:20:37,667
What are you making?

271
00:20:38,333 --> 00:20:39,833
Uh, cioppino.

272
00:20:40,708 --> 00:20:42,208
It's like a fish stew.

273
00:20:43,417 --> 00:20:44,458
Huh.

274
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,083
Hey, I can cook.

275
00:20:47,875 --> 00:20:50,083
Okay? I'm cooking. I can cook.

276
00:20:51,125 --> 00:20:53,042
It's just Stewart coming, right?

277
00:20:53,125 --> 00:20:55,875
Uh, I think he's bringing Bethany.

278
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:00,083
I mean, we could just get In-N-Out
and tacos or something.

279
00:21:00,167 --> 00:21:04,583
You can't invite people over to dinner
and then just get In-N-Out.

280
00:21:04,667 --> 00:21:06,625
-Come on.
-Oh, I think this is burning.

281
00:21:06,708 --> 00:21:08,958
-Okay. Shit.
-Oh, boy.

282
00:21:09,042 --> 00:21:11,750
Out of my kitchen. Out.
Everybody out of my kitchen.

283
00:21:11,833 --> 00:21:13,125
Okay, chapino.

284
00:21:13,208 --> 00:21:16,208
Cioppino. We're getting banished.

285
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:25,167
But that's assuming
that a police presence reduces crime.

286
00:21:25,250 --> 00:21:28,292
Or that it helps at all
at resolving disputes.

287
00:21:28,375 --> 00:21:31,833
I mean, there are studies
that show the opposite.

288
00:21:31,917 --> 00:21:33,167
-What studies?
-What?

289
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:34,333
What studies?

290
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,125
There are multiple.

291
00:21:36,208 --> 00:21:37,542
I can't cite one.

292
00:21:37,625 --> 00:21:39,667
Okay, so say somebody
broke into your house,

293
00:21:39,750 --> 00:21:40,833
you would, what?

294
00:21:41,708 --> 00:21:45,042
Honestly, I mean, I would grab my bat

295
00:21:45,125 --> 00:21:47,417
before I would call the police
or do anything.

296
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:48,917
-Stewart.
-I'm serious.

297
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:53,333
Obviously, the first priority
would be my partner and I's safety.

298
00:21:53,417 --> 00:21:56,417
But take the cash, take the TV.
The stuff isn't...

299
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:59,708
But, Stewart, what if they wanted
your Ted Williams rookie card?

300
00:21:59,792 --> 00:22:00,917
What would you do?

301
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:04,458
Well, then I would know
that the person under the ski mask is you.

302
00:22:05,333 --> 00:22:06,708
You bitch.

303
00:22:06,792 --> 00:22:09,125
Apologies, to everyone at the table.

304
00:22:10,625 --> 00:22:13,500
Polly, I hear you guys met
at one of our tenants' rights events.

305
00:22:16,083 --> 00:22:17,167
-Yeah.
-Mm.

306
00:22:19,292 --> 00:22:20,458
Um...

307
00:22:21,250 --> 00:22:22,625
Where is your place?

308
00:22:22,708 --> 00:22:24,292
Oh, I live in Boyle Heights.

309
00:22:25,208 --> 00:22:28,458
Oh, nice. Uh, why way out there?

310
00:22:30,542 --> 00:22:32,125
Well, that's what I can afford.

311
00:22:32,208 --> 00:22:33,667
Oh, I get you.

312
00:22:35,417 --> 00:22:38,333
-Where do you live?
-Oh, Silver Lake.

313
00:22:39,708 --> 00:22:40,833
Mm.

314
00:22:40,917 --> 00:22:41,917
I get ya.

315
00:22:43,333 --> 00:22:45,417
Anyways, I'm actually
thinking about moving.

316
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:47,542
Just, LA's so expensive.

317
00:22:49,958 --> 00:22:52,333
You mean, like, outside of Los Angeles?

318
00:22:52,417 --> 00:22:53,542
Yeah.

319
00:22:53,625 --> 00:22:56,542
I just... I don't know
how long I can stay here for.

320
00:22:56,625 --> 00:22:57,750
Can I be done?

321
00:23:00,083 --> 00:23:02,958
Well, you're not watching TV,
if that's what you're after.

322
00:23:03,042 --> 00:23:04,750
-I can go hang with her.
-Yeah.

323
00:23:05,792 --> 00:23:07,917
Yeah. Okay, great. Thank you.

324
00:23:10,542 --> 00:23:12,084
The soup is so good, by the way.

325
00:23:12,167 --> 00:23:13,667
-Mm-hmm.
-Oh, good.

326
00:23:13,750 --> 00:23:17,250
Oh, my God.
Look at this little angel eating soup.

327
00:23:17,333 --> 00:23:18,792
Yeah. It's really interesting.

328
00:23:18,875 --> 00:23:21,542
The sooner you start them
on real food, the better.

329
00:23:21,625 --> 00:23:23,708
You know, because baby food
can be such a crutch.

330
00:23:23,792 --> 00:23:27,542
Ugh, tell me about it. I've been trying
to wean myself off baby food for a while.

331
00:23:28,083 --> 00:23:29,167
I want one.

332
00:23:30,417 --> 00:23:32,208
-Can we talk about this later?
-Mm-hmm.

333
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,083
Thank you.

334
00:23:58,792 --> 00:24:00,042
Mommy!

335
00:24:01,625 --> 00:24:03,083
Oh, God.

336
00:24:05,417 --> 00:24:06,792
Oh, God.

337
00:24:06,875 --> 00:24:09,500
-Oh, she threw up.
-Oh, no. I know, baby.

338
00:24:09,583 --> 00:24:11,375
I'm sorry, baby.

339
00:24:12,042 --> 00:24:13,667
Oh, God, I'm gonna...

340
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:18,708
I don't know what happened.

341
00:24:18,792 --> 00:24:20,250
I figure it was the food.

342
00:24:20,333 --> 00:24:21,458
Yeah, no shit.

343
00:24:23,083 --> 00:24:26,000
Should we call Stewart?

344
00:24:26,083 --> 00:24:27,125
Oh, no.

345
00:24:27,958 --> 00:24:30,292
Oh, God, Josie. Oh, God.

346
00:24:47,125 --> 00:24:48,250
How's Emma?

347
00:24:48,333 --> 00:24:50,792
She's doing better. She's with Miguel now.

348
00:24:51,583 --> 00:24:52,667
How is she?

349
00:24:53,292 --> 00:24:54,958
They need to get her hydrated.

350
00:24:58,792 --> 00:25:00,708
It just doesn't matter how hard I try.

351
00:25:02,833 --> 00:25:05,167
How careful I am.
I just always fuck everything up.

352
00:25:05,250 --> 00:25:06,333
I fuck everything up.

353
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:09,583
You're wrong.

354
00:25:11,083 --> 00:25:12,292
Yeah, you don't know me.

355
00:25:15,583 --> 00:25:16,667
Yes, I do.

356
00:25:19,958 --> 00:25:21,625
You think if you try hard enough,

357
00:25:22,875 --> 00:25:24,708
you can stop bad things from happening.

358
00:25:26,333 --> 00:25:27,333
But you can't.

359
00:25:28,708 --> 00:25:29,792
Nobody can.

360
00:25:38,250 --> 00:25:40,583
God, you're so cold. Here.

361
00:25:43,833 --> 00:25:45,875
-Oh, thank you.
-Here, okay.

362
00:25:54,833 --> 00:25:56,125
I don't want you to go.

363
00:25:59,167 --> 00:26:00,417
I don't want to either.

364
00:26:01,292 --> 00:26:02,333
I just...

365
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:05,083
I don't think I have a choice.

366
00:26:27,208 --> 00:26:28,208
Bye, Polly.

367
00:26:35,125 --> 00:26:40,500
♪ The sun, the sun
The sun was rising from the field ♪

368
00:26:49,333 --> 00:26:55,042

373
00:27:25,750 --> 00:27:27,292
So what? You don't think we should?

374
00:27:27,375 --> 00:27:28,625
It's not that.

375
00:27:30,042 --> 00:27:32,042
If you think it'll help having her here...

376
00:27:32,125 --> 00:27:33,125
Yeah, I do.

377
00:27:37,542 --> 00:27:38,875
What? What is it?

378
00:27:38,958 --> 00:27:42,167
I'm just thinking about
after Emma was born.

379
00:27:42,250 --> 00:27:44,792
Okay. I was spiraling out.

380
00:27:44,875 --> 00:27:47,875
-It happens to a lot of women after birth.
-I know. I know.

381
00:27:48,667 --> 00:27:49,833
It's just...

382
00:27:51,292 --> 00:27:53,292
What?

383
00:27:53,875 --> 00:27:56,250
You have this confidence about you,

384
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,583
and I really didn't know

385
00:28:01,208 --> 00:28:02,834
what a hard time you were having until...

386
00:28:02,917 --> 00:28:05,250
I think you're making a bigger deal
out of it than it was.

387
00:28:05,333 --> 00:28:07,458
You ripped the kitchen apart, Caitlin.

388
00:28:08,042 --> 00:28:09,333
-I ripped it apart?
-Yeah.

389
00:28:09,417 --> 00:28:10,792
-Okay.
-At 4:00 in the morning,

390
00:28:10,875 --> 00:28:13,333
you had everything on the floor
and a bottle of bleach.

391
00:28:13,417 --> 00:28:14,875
Fine. Fine.

392
00:28:15,917 --> 00:28:17,667
Do you remember what you said to me?

393
00:28:17,750 --> 00:28:21,500
I think I said something like,
there was a smell, which there was,

394
00:28:21,583 --> 00:28:23,250
and that it could have been mold.

395
00:28:24,333 --> 00:28:25,917
You said our lives were in danger.

396
00:28:30,167 --> 00:28:32,667
And, I don't know, I guess
if you're feeling that way again...

397
00:28:32,750 --> 00:28:34,042
I'm not.

398
00:28:36,750 --> 00:28:37,750
Miguel...

399
00:28:39,458 --> 00:28:41,000
I'm not, okay? I'm okay.

400
00:28:44,958 --> 00:28:46,042
Okay.

401
00:28:49,750 --> 00:28:51,542
Are you okay?

402
00:28:51,625 --> 00:28:52,750
Because I'm okay.

403
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:55,750
I'm just saying.

404
00:28:58,750 --> 00:29:00,417
It's a really
sweet little space.

405
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:01,667
I think you'll like it.

406
00:29:01,750 --> 00:29:04,042
-It's, um, got its own kitchen.
-Okay.

407
00:29:04,125 --> 00:29:07,875
And its own entrance up here,
so you can come and go as you like.

408
00:29:07,958 --> 00:29:10,250
And you just have to make it your own.

409
00:29:10,792 --> 00:29:12,500
Okay, this is it.

410
00:29:14,583 --> 00:29:17,792
Miguel really wanted his parents
to move here, you know, to be safer.

411
00:29:17,875 --> 00:29:21,417
But, um, his mom's not
the biggest fan of the States.

412
00:29:22,542 --> 00:29:23,625
Who is?

413
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,083
What do you think?

414
00:29:32,458 --> 00:29:33,542
It's perfect.

415
00:29:34,792 --> 00:29:35,875
Great.

416
00:29:37,708 --> 00:29:41,167
Um, yes, you've got
a closet here, shelves.

417
00:29:54,083 --> 00:29:55,833
This a good spot for your coffee?

418
00:29:55,917 --> 00:29:57,667
Yeah, that's fine. It's perfect. Yeah.

419
00:30:09,375 --> 00:30:10,375
Emma.

420
00:30:33,042 --> 00:30:34,250
Say bye-bye.

421
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,000
Bye-bye.

422
00:30:38,625 --> 00:30:39,792
Yeah.

423
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:07,583
Hey.

424
00:32:07,667 --> 00:32:09,833
Oh, I'm so sorry.

425
00:32:09,917 --> 00:32:13,625
Um, it's 8:30, so I just was wondering
if I should put Emma to bed.

426
00:32:15,042 --> 00:32:16,917
-Wow, it's 8:30?
-Yeah.

427
00:32:22,125 --> 00:32:23,333
Is something tight?

428
00:32:23,958 --> 00:32:25,750
-Yeah.
-Um...

429
00:32:26,458 --> 00:32:28,417
I know this technique
that might help.

430
00:32:31,958 --> 00:32:34,833
-Okay.
-Okay. Just turn around.

431
00:32:38,625 --> 00:32:39,708
Let's see.

432
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,417
Okay. It's gonna hurt a little bit.

433
00:32:58,708 --> 00:32:59,792
There you go.

434
00:33:05,167 --> 00:33:06,250
Thank you.

435
00:33:07,042 --> 00:33:08,250
Yeah.

436
00:33:10,750 --> 00:33:13,000
I should... I should put Emma to bed.

437
00:33:13,083 --> 00:33:14,208
Okay. Yeah.

438
00:34:01,250 --> 00:34:03,500
I'm sorry.
I just... I couldn't resist.

439
00:34:09,625 --> 00:34:12,250
Hey, go back to sleep.
I can listen up for Josie.

440
00:34:12,333 --> 00:34:13,542
It's fine.

441
00:34:13,625 --> 00:34:14,625
It's okay.

442
00:34:23,625 --> 00:34:24,708
What?

443
00:34:29,167 --> 00:34:30,250
Nothing.

444
00:34:35,333 --> 00:34:36,417
Okay.

445
00:35:03,250 --> 00:35:04,333
What do you think?

446
00:35:06,250 --> 00:35:07,292
I love it.

447
00:35:09,417 --> 00:35:12,375
Just like the one you made for Emma.

448
00:35:13,792 --> 00:35:15,352
She wouldn't let her friends sit in it.

449
00:35:20,167 --> 00:35:21,333
Is that formula?

450
00:35:23,583 --> 00:35:24,667
Yeah.

451
00:35:28,375 --> 00:35:31,083
I know. I know
most people don't care about that.

452
00:35:36,875 --> 00:35:37,917
Hi.

453
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,208
Um...

454
00:35:40,125 --> 00:35:41,833
I found this in the trash.

455
00:35:43,292 --> 00:35:44,375
You haven't...

456
00:35:45,083 --> 00:35:47,583
I mean, you didn't
feed this to Josie, right?

457
00:35:47,667 --> 00:35:51,292
Oh. Yeah. I've been having a hard time
getting her to drink the breast milk.

458
00:35:51,375 --> 00:35:52,417
So...

459
00:35:53,083 --> 00:35:56,542
I'm just confused because we had talked
about not feeding her sugar at all.

460
00:35:58,083 --> 00:35:59,208
We did?

461
00:36:01,042 --> 00:36:02,125
Yes.

462
00:36:03,167 --> 00:36:04,917
Oh, I'm so sorry, Caitlin.

463
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,792
I-I didn't remember that.

464
00:36:09,750 --> 00:36:11,875
-You...
-It's...

465
00:36:11,958 --> 00:36:12,958
Whatever you want.

466
00:36:13,042 --> 00:36:15,083
It's just, she might drink
a little bit less.

467
00:36:17,625 --> 00:36:20,083
-It's just, I clearly remember that we...
-Mom...

468
00:36:21,708 --> 00:36:22,917
We were playing.

469
00:36:30,458 --> 00:36:31,625
Right. Sorry.

470
00:36:38,833 --> 00:36:41,167
Recently.
Where should we begin?

471
00:36:41,833 --> 00:36:44,833
We've been focusing on the secrets,

472
00:36:45,917 --> 00:36:48,458
the stuff we push under the rug,

473
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:52,750
conversations that we are known to have,

474
00:36:52,833 --> 00:36:55,083
and certainly not in the public square.

475
00:36:55,792 --> 00:36:56,833
The forbidden.

476
00:37:24,042 --> 00:37:26,083
Well, multiple times a week.

477
00:37:26,167 --> 00:37:27,417
Right. Otherwise...

478
00:37:27,500 --> 00:37:30,667
Otherwise, well, a lot of things.

479
00:37:31,708 --> 00:37:34,833
Depression, anxiety,

480
00:37:34,917 --> 00:37:36,167
prostate cancer.

481
00:37:36,250 --> 00:37:37,458
-Cancer?
-Mm-hmm.

482
00:37:37,542 --> 00:37:40,458
And your source on this
is some high school boyfriend?

483
00:37:44,667 --> 00:37:46,375
-Hey.
-Hey.

484
00:37:49,125 --> 00:37:50,958
This is my friend, Amelia.

485
00:37:51,917 --> 00:37:53,000
Nice to meet you.

486
00:37:53,750 --> 00:37:55,167
Caitlin. Mm.

487
00:37:58,958 --> 00:38:02,000
They, um... They got burgers.
I'm stealing some.

488
00:38:02,667 --> 00:38:03,917
Yeah. Yeah, I see that.

489
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,958
You're really treating yourselves.

490
00:38:10,708 --> 00:38:13,667
Uh, I mean,
we have more if you want some.

491
00:38:15,917 --> 00:38:17,750
No, no, no. I'm good.

492
00:38:17,833 --> 00:38:19,542
-You sure?
-Yeah.

493
00:38:21,292 --> 00:38:24,833
Uh, I'm just gonna take a shower, I think.

494
00:38:25,583 --> 00:38:26,625
Night.

495
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:35,917
What about women?

496
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:39,042
-Ah, it's different.
-No, they're not.

497
00:38:40,958 --> 00:38:43,792
I have to ask more questions for that one.

498
00:40:45,667 --> 00:40:47,917
-Can you follow instructions?
-Mm-hmm.

499
00:40:51,583 --> 00:40:52,667
Don't move.

500
00:41:13,458 --> 00:41:15,250
You're gonna make me fucking cum.

501
00:41:19,250 --> 00:41:22,750
Choke me.

502
00:41:47,958 --> 00:41:49,125
Who's Olivia?

503
00:41:52,542 --> 00:41:53,708
She's my little sister.

504
00:41:54,208 --> 00:41:55,375
Mm.

505
00:42:05,583 --> 00:42:07,000
-Good morning.
-Hi.

506
00:42:08,250 --> 00:42:09,333
Your coffee's ready.

507
00:42:15,250 --> 00:42:16,917
Guess who got four ounces in?

508
00:42:19,167 --> 00:42:20,167
What?

509
00:42:21,792 --> 00:42:22,875
Of breast milk.

510
00:42:24,667 --> 00:42:25,750
We're back on track.

511
00:42:30,167 --> 00:42:31,208
Great.

512
00:42:36,167 --> 00:42:38,042
Okay. I think it's looking better.

513
00:42:41,875 --> 00:42:43,875
Perfect. Gold star.

514
00:42:47,250 --> 00:42:51,208
♪ Happy birthday to you ♪

515
00:42:51,292 --> 00:42:52,958
-Whoo!
-Whoo!

516
00:42:56,917 --> 00:42:58,458
What does "depressed" mean?

517
00:43:02,458 --> 00:43:05,167
It means that you're sad,
that you don't like yourself.

518
00:43:06,125 --> 00:43:07,208
Is that like my mom?

519
00:43:08,375 --> 00:43:09,750
No.

520
00:43:09,833 --> 00:43:10,875
She's angry.

521
00:43:11,375 --> 00:43:13,458
-At me?
-No.

522
00:43:14,875 --> 00:43:17,250
-At me.
-Why?

523
00:43:20,375 --> 00:43:21,917
I know a secret about her.

524
00:43:23,083 --> 00:43:26,250
And when you know a secret about someone,
you hold power over them.

525
00:43:26,333 --> 00:43:27,500
People don't like that.

526
00:43:28,042 --> 00:43:29,500
What's the secret?

527
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,000
She's pretending to be someone else.

528
00:43:37,208 --> 00:43:38,458
Who is she?

529
00:43:40,875 --> 00:43:42,583
Not who she's pretending to be.

530
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,208
Hi, Leah.
Sorry to keep you waiting.

531
00:44:26,333 --> 00:44:27,417
This is Caitlin.

532
00:44:28,042 --> 00:44:29,417
Of course. Caitlin.

533
00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:30,500
Sorry about that.

534
00:44:31,583 --> 00:44:35,625
Uh, I've been having a weird reaction
to my medication lately.

535
00:44:35,708 --> 00:44:38,417
It's been making me feel
a little bit jittery.

536
00:44:39,500 --> 00:44:40,833
Well, we could lower the dose.

537
00:44:41,583 --> 00:44:45,292
You want to try taking half a pill
for a week and see how that goes?

538
00:44:46,375 --> 00:44:49,750
So you just want to lower the dose
based on that one comment?

539
00:44:50,958 --> 00:44:53,417
Well, it's whatever
you're comfortable with, Caitlin.

540
00:44:54,083 --> 00:44:55,083
Shit.

541
00:44:59,083 --> 00:45:02,375
And right in the middle
of his science lecture...

542
00:45:02,458 --> 00:45:04,833
...Mr. Hutcherson sneezed

543
00:45:04,917 --> 00:45:08,250
and he spat all over Nicole's face.

544
00:45:08,333 --> 00:45:10,875
And she tried,
like, wiping it off with her T-shirt.

545
00:45:10,958 --> 00:45:13,417
That's so gross. Mmh-mmh.

546
00:45:13,500 --> 00:45:14,875
Yeah, it was hilarious.

547
00:45:19,667 --> 00:45:20,875
Mom?

548
00:45:22,417 --> 00:45:23,500
Mm-hmm?

549
00:45:25,417 --> 00:45:28,125
I've been having these feelings.

550
00:45:29,875 --> 00:45:33,417
You know, in a movie,
when people are getting married

551
00:45:33,500 --> 00:45:36,458
or when they're kissing
or trying to make a baby?

552
00:45:38,333 --> 00:45:41,250
When I watch that, I want to be
the daddy, the husband.

553
00:45:44,625 --> 00:45:46,250
Okay, um...

554
00:45:47,750 --> 00:45:49,875
So, are you saying
you wish you were a man?

555
00:45:49,958 --> 00:45:51,667
No. I wish...

556
00:45:53,250 --> 00:45:54,833
I want to be kissing the woman.

557
00:45:54,917 --> 00:45:56,958
I want her to love me, not him.

558
00:45:59,250 --> 00:46:03,417
Listen, um, you're getting into that age

559
00:46:03,500 --> 00:46:07,042
where you're gonna start having
all kinds of feelings, um,

560
00:46:07,125 --> 00:46:11,250
-and I think whatever decision you make...
-No, it's not a decision.

561
00:46:12,250 --> 00:46:13,708
Okay? We're not saying that.

562
00:46:13,792 --> 00:46:15,958
No, but I have. I've decided.

563
00:46:16,042 --> 00:46:18,542
When I grow up, I want to have a wife,
not a husband.

564
00:46:24,583 --> 00:46:27,042
Is this something
that you two have talked about?

565
00:46:28,958 --> 00:46:30,042
Um...

566
00:46:31,375 --> 00:46:33,875
Well, she just had asked me
about, you know, marriage

567
00:46:33,958 --> 00:46:35,958
and the types of couples that there are.

568
00:46:38,625 --> 00:46:41,167
She's never said
anything like this to me before.

569
00:46:41,250 --> 00:46:42,417
So I think that maybe...

570
00:46:42,500 --> 00:46:44,000
Mom, I think this.
I'm saying this.

571
00:46:44,083 --> 00:46:45,875
Of course. And we hear you.

572
00:46:46,750 --> 00:46:49,292
But maybe you overheard Polly
saying this and you're...

573
00:46:49,375 --> 00:46:51,208
Caitlin, it wasn't that, okay?

574
00:46:51,292 --> 00:46:52,667
Can you stop talking for a second?

575
00:46:52,750 --> 00:46:55,958
You want me to stay a baby forever,
but I'm not! I'm not a baby!

576
00:46:57,750 --> 00:46:58,833
I hate you!

577
00:47:06,542 --> 00:47:07,542
I'm...

578
00:47:08,417 --> 00:47:09,917
I'm so sorry, Caitlin.

579
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:13,292
-I did not think you'd have a problem...
-I don't have a problem with it!

580
00:47:15,333 --> 00:47:16,417
Obviously.

581
00:47:19,333 --> 00:47:21,750
Well, um, I'm gonna go check on her.

582
00:47:32,917 --> 00:47:34,417
It's okay. She'll get over it.

583
00:47:37,833 --> 00:47:39,292
You don't think it's strange?

584
00:47:41,333 --> 00:47:43,875
-She's getting older. She's...
-She's ten.

585
00:47:45,292 --> 00:47:47,792
-How old were you when you started...
-Why are you asking me that?

586
00:47:47,875 --> 00:47:50,500
-I'm just trying to understand.
-It has nothing to do with me.

587
00:47:50,583 --> 00:47:52,833
She's... She's too young. That's it.

588
00:47:52,917 --> 00:47:55,542
And you're not here.
You don't see what's been happening.

589
00:47:55,625 --> 00:47:57,958
They go into her room.
They're in there for hours,

590
00:47:58,042 --> 00:48:00,708
and we don't know what they're doing
or what they're talking about.

591
00:48:06,083 --> 00:48:07,167
You're saying...

592
00:48:08,917 --> 00:48:12,125
all the attention
that Emma has been giving her,

593
00:48:12,208 --> 00:48:13,708
how close they've gotten,

594
00:48:15,625 --> 00:48:16,833
it's making you jealous.

595
00:48:20,042 --> 00:48:21,167
Well, that sounds bad.

596
00:48:21,250 --> 00:48:24,125
-Like...
-No, no, no. It's not bad at all.

597
00:48:24,208 --> 00:48:25,292
It's not bad.

598
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,458
It's just been us the whole time.

599
00:48:28,542 --> 00:48:30,958
Now there's this new person in the house.

600
00:48:32,708 --> 00:48:33,917
It's weird.

601
00:48:35,250 --> 00:48:36,708
Honey, I get it.

602
00:48:43,958 --> 00:48:46,333
I guess there's just
this part of me that's like...

603
00:48:46,958 --> 00:48:48,000
What?

604
00:48:49,292 --> 00:48:51,542
I don't want her to grow up, you know?

605
00:48:54,542 --> 00:48:57,125
I just want her to stay mine.
I want her to be mine.

606
00:49:01,458 --> 00:49:02,542
Um...

607
00:49:03,833 --> 00:49:05,083
That's just...

608
00:49:06,083 --> 00:49:07,125
sick.

609
00:49:14,500 --> 00:49:16,792
Oh, honey.

610
00:50:56,042 --> 00:50:57,750
That one looks so cool.

611
00:50:57,833 --> 00:50:59,833
-It's huge.
-The red and orange ones?

612
00:50:59,917 --> 00:51:01,750
-Wow.
-Yeah. Those are beautiful.

613
00:51:10,125 --> 00:51:11,833
You wanna go check out over there?

614
00:51:12,375 --> 00:51:13,875
Oh, okay.

615
00:51:15,083 --> 00:51:16,417
We're gonna go for a walk.

616
00:51:16,958 --> 00:51:17,958
Okay.

617
00:51:32,250 --> 00:51:33,333
You okay?

618
00:51:34,958 --> 00:51:35,958
Yeah.

619
00:51:37,125 --> 00:51:38,125
It's nice.

620
00:52:00,417 --> 00:52:02,000
Do you want some help cleaning up?

621
00:52:02,875 --> 00:52:03,875
Sure.

622
00:52:11,958 --> 00:52:12,958
You're, um...

623
00:52:14,375 --> 00:52:16,042
You're wearing the dress I gave you.

624
00:52:17,208 --> 00:52:18,208
Yeah.

625
00:52:22,042 --> 00:52:23,125
Looks nice.

626
00:52:24,292 --> 00:52:25,833
Oh, thanks.

627
00:52:38,958 --> 00:52:41,875
Mom! Mom!

628
00:52:41,958 --> 00:52:44,125
-Mom! Fireworks!
-Get down! Get down!

629
00:52:49,167 --> 00:52:50,500
What happened? What happened?

630
00:52:51,167 --> 00:52:53,375
Where did you get that from? Answer me!

631
00:52:53,458 --> 00:52:54,875
-I don't know.
-Caitlin, don't.

632
00:52:54,958 --> 00:52:57,542
Do you have any idea
what could have happened?

633
00:52:57,625 --> 00:52:59,625
Stop it! Look at her. She's terrified.

634
00:52:59,708 --> 00:53:01,250
-Polly!
-It's okay. It's okay.

635
00:53:01,333 --> 00:53:03,042
I'm sorry. I got them at the park.

636
00:53:03,125 --> 00:53:04,750
Why would you do that?

637
00:53:04,833 --> 00:53:06,750
I thought it'd be fun.
I didn't think she...

638
00:53:06,833 --> 00:53:08,417
-Fun?
-It was an accident, okay?

639
00:53:08,500 --> 00:53:10,083
-What's the matter with you?
-What?

640
00:53:10,167 --> 00:53:12,458
She did it on purpose.
Why can't you see that?

641
00:53:12,542 --> 00:53:14,875
-Why would she do that?
-She knew what would happen.

642
00:53:14,958 --> 00:53:16,959
-She wanted this to happen.
-I just think...

643
00:53:17,042 --> 00:53:18,708
You know, maybe I should go.

644
00:53:18,792 --> 00:53:20,333
Yeah? Yeah. Leave!

645
00:53:20,417 --> 00:53:21,834
Let's take a break and we can all...

646
00:53:21,917 --> 00:53:23,333
No, no. Leave!

647
00:53:23,417 --> 00:53:24,417
Leave this house!

648
00:53:24,500 --> 00:53:26,125
Mom, it was my fault.

649
00:53:27,792 --> 00:53:30,792
I mean, if that's what you want.

650
00:53:30,875 --> 00:53:32,917
-Wait. Let's just please...
-No, no.

651
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:35,208
Do you need me to do this myself?
Because I will.

652
00:53:35,292 --> 00:53:37,667
-Where is she gonna go?
-I don't care!

653
00:53:37,750 --> 00:53:38,750
Not here!

654
00:53:40,500 --> 00:53:42,500
What are you doing? Go! Pack!

655
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:47,583
-Okay. It's okay. All right? I'm sorry.
-No, Polly.

656
00:53:47,667 --> 00:53:48,667
I'm sorry.

657
00:53:51,250 --> 00:53:53,625
Polly...

658
00:54:09,417 --> 00:54:10,417
Miguel.

659
00:54:18,708 --> 00:54:19,708
What?

660
00:54:20,917 --> 00:54:21,917
Do you believe me?

661
00:54:23,208 --> 00:54:24,708
Por Dios, no puede ser.

662
00:54:24,792 --> 00:54:25,917
Do you?

663
00:54:27,458 --> 00:54:29,833
Believe you about what?

664
00:54:29,917 --> 00:54:32,625
That she did it on purpose,

665
00:54:32,708 --> 00:54:34,708
that she knew what would happen.

666
00:54:34,792 --> 00:54:36,583
No, that's...

667
00:54:36,667 --> 00:54:39,417
What? You think she just gave her
fucking fireworks and it's fine?

668
00:54:39,500 --> 00:54:40,917
I think it was a mistake.

669
00:54:42,375 --> 00:54:43,417
Okay?

670
00:54:44,125 --> 00:54:46,458
-She just wanted to have fun.
-Ugh.

671
00:54:46,542 --> 00:54:48,208
Yeah, of course you'd think that.

672
00:54:49,250 --> 00:54:50,250
What?

673
00:54:51,542 --> 00:54:52,583
Why?

674
00:54:52,667 --> 00:54:54,042
Because I'm Mexican?

675
00:54:54,625 --> 00:54:56,500
I can't help myself?
I fucking love fireworks?

676
00:54:56,583 --> 00:54:57,583
No.

677
00:54:57,667 --> 00:55:00,000
No. Because no matter what I say,
you won't listen to me

678
00:55:00,083 --> 00:55:02,958
because you think I'm a fucking nutcase
that you need to handle.

679
00:55:03,042 --> 00:55:04,208
No, no, no.

680
00:55:10,875 --> 00:55:11,958
You're...

681
00:55:15,500 --> 00:55:18,667
You're struggling again.

682
00:55:25,292 --> 00:55:26,750
It's not your fault.

683
00:55:28,208 --> 00:55:29,833
But I can't help you

684
00:55:29,917 --> 00:55:33,333
if you're not willing to see
the possibility that you could be wrong.

685
00:55:34,417 --> 00:55:36,000
Can you see that possibility?

686
00:55:42,875 --> 00:55:43,875
I don't know.

687
00:55:47,708 --> 00:55:48,958
I need you to try.

688
00:55:54,500 --> 00:55:55,583
Or what?

689
00:56:00,875 --> 00:56:01,875
Miguel.

690
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:05,000
Or what?

691
00:56:09,208 --> 00:56:10,208
Okay.

692
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:16,167
Do you...

693
00:56:18,542 --> 00:56:19,917
Do you know where she went?

694
00:56:22,583 --> 00:56:24,917
Happy fucking new year to you!

695
00:56:26,333 --> 00:56:28,125
Why do you do this to me?

696
00:57:25,875 --> 00:57:27,917
Hey, come on, man.

697
00:57:34,583 --> 00:57:36,708
Hey, man. I'm fucking serious.

698
00:57:36,792 --> 00:57:38,000
Hey, hey!

699
00:58:00,875 --> 00:58:02,083
Shut up!

700
00:58:36,708 --> 00:58:37,708
I'm sorry.

701
00:58:40,583 --> 00:58:41,583
I, um...

702
00:58:43,958 --> 00:58:46,458
I've had some issues in the past, and I...

703
00:58:47,708 --> 00:58:49,750
I thought
that I had dealt with them, but...

704
00:58:54,250 --> 00:58:55,250
I understand.

705
00:58:58,500 --> 00:59:01,000
But I have a handle on that now, so...

706
00:59:16,875 --> 00:59:18,542
Caitlin, you're not crazy.

707
00:59:19,708 --> 00:59:22,167
You know what we need?
More data.

708
00:59:26,292 --> 00:59:28,417
It's getting better. I, um...

709
00:59:28,500 --> 00:59:29,917
I just need to keep focusing...

710
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:33,625
What do you know about her?
I mean, besides what she's told you?

711
00:59:34,417 --> 00:59:35,583
I mean, you can...

712
00:59:36,458 --> 00:59:38,583
You can think something,
but that doesn't...

713
00:59:39,292 --> 00:59:40,625
That doesn't make it real.

714
00:59:41,208 --> 00:59:42,917
Look, what are we gonna find out?

715
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:45,083
Probably that everything's normal.

716
00:59:45,167 --> 00:59:47,458
So why not just take a look. All right?

717
01:00:05,708 --> 01:00:07,042
You're my favorite psycho.

718
01:00:50,375 --> 01:00:51,375
Hi.

719
01:00:53,167 --> 01:00:54,167
Hi.

720
01:00:55,208 --> 01:00:57,458
They finally finished
the renovations in here.

721
01:00:58,125 --> 01:00:59,333
They did a good job.

722
01:01:02,208 --> 01:01:03,417
Glad you approve.

723
01:01:05,625 --> 01:01:08,292
-Sorry. I'll get out of your hair.
-Listen.

724
01:01:10,333 --> 01:01:12,167
I know this is their house, and,

725
01:01:12,917 --> 01:01:15,458
well, you're their friend, but...

726
01:01:16,042 --> 01:01:17,625
Well, this feels like...

727
01:01:18,792 --> 01:01:20,542
my space, so...

728
01:01:23,625 --> 01:01:25,583
And you don't want people
just coming in and out.

729
01:01:30,667 --> 01:01:31,750
Have a good day.

730
01:03:27,417 --> 01:03:29,459
You have reached the voice mailbox

731
01:03:29,542 --> 01:03:33,375
for 515-177-3...

732
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:38,250
Oh.

733
01:03:38,333 --> 01:03:40,375
-Here you are.
-Hi.

734
01:03:40,458 --> 01:03:43,833
Uh, is there more breast milk?
I looked in the freezer, there's nothing.

735
01:03:44,917 --> 01:03:46,125
Oh, uh...

736
01:03:46,875 --> 01:03:48,625
What are you doing in here anyway?

737
01:03:49,750 --> 01:03:52,083
Nothing. I just need to finish something.

738
01:03:52,875 --> 01:03:54,667
Okay.

739
01:03:55,208 --> 01:03:56,542
Should I give her formula?

740
01:03:57,208 --> 01:03:59,250
Don't give her... No, can... Um...

741
01:03:59,333 --> 01:04:02,208
Can you just take her for five minutes
and I'll be right in?

742
01:04:03,292 --> 01:04:04,292
Sure.

743
01:04:56,417 --> 01:04:58,583
-Oh, my God.
-Found a week later.

744
01:04:58,667 --> 01:04:59,667
Rosanna?

745
01:05:00,333 --> 01:05:03,083
-Yes.
-Hi, um, I'm Caitlin.

746
01:05:03,167 --> 01:05:05,458
I called you a while back about Polly.

747
01:05:05,542 --> 01:05:06,750
She nannied for you.

748
01:05:06,833 --> 01:05:07,958
I know who you are.

749
01:05:08,542 --> 01:05:10,125
Can I talk to you for a second?

750
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:12,000
Sure.

751
01:05:13,750 --> 01:05:16,250
-Is Polly okay?
-Yeah, she's fine.

752
01:05:16,917 --> 01:05:20,958
She's been involved in some dangerous
incidents with my children, so...

753
01:05:23,125 --> 01:05:26,792
Listen, Polly hasn't returned
my calls for a while.

754
01:05:27,667 --> 01:05:30,958
If she's using again,
her behavior probably is erratic.

755
01:05:31,042 --> 01:05:34,167
So, she met you here then, is that right?

756
01:05:34,250 --> 01:05:36,542
And she told you what?
She told you she's an addict?

757
01:05:38,042 --> 01:05:39,042
Yes.

758
01:05:39,542 --> 01:05:42,292
And I made a promise to help her
however I could.

759
01:05:44,667 --> 01:05:46,292
Did she ever even work for you?

760
01:05:47,208 --> 01:05:49,667
-Did she take care of your kids?
-Sh...

761
01:05:50,875 --> 01:05:52,667
Yes, she did.

762
01:05:56,042 --> 01:05:57,125
You're lying.

763
01:05:58,083 --> 01:06:02,000
You know, if you had any idea
what Polly's been through...

764
01:06:02,083 --> 01:06:03,083
Really? Like what?

765
01:06:03,167 --> 01:06:05,333
Like when I met her,
she was living in her car,

766
01:06:05,417 --> 01:06:08,750
and had a boyfriend who beat her up
so bad she had to go to the hospital.

767
01:06:08,833 --> 01:06:10,500
Okay. And you just believed her,
is that right?

768
01:06:10,583 --> 01:06:13,250
What? Listen, I have a meeting here.

769
01:06:13,333 --> 01:06:15,875
I'm so sorry about your meeting.
You lied to me.

770
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:18,417
You put my children in danger!

771
01:06:18,500 --> 01:06:20,209
-Do you even care about that?
-I do.

772
01:06:20,292 --> 01:06:23,208
-And I'm trying...
-What if nothing she told you is true?

773
01:06:23,292 --> 01:06:24,292
What then?

774
01:06:25,542 --> 01:06:26,583
What then?

775
01:06:28,250 --> 01:06:29,542
Are you gonna answer me?

776
01:06:29,625 --> 01:06:32,000
-Okay. I'm gonna ask you to leave.
-I'm going!

777
01:06:42,542 --> 01:06:45,667
Hey, uh, it's Stewart.

778
01:06:47,125 --> 01:06:49,500
Um, give me a call when you get this.

779
01:06:50,583 --> 01:06:53,333
I, uh... I think we should talk.

780
01:07:20,333 --> 01:07:21,333
Hey.

781
01:07:22,083 --> 01:07:23,292
I need to talk to you.

782
01:07:27,042 --> 01:07:28,083
Where'd you go?

783
01:07:28,167 --> 01:07:30,083
Out. I needed to check on something.

784
01:07:34,125 --> 01:07:35,917
Okay. What?

785
01:07:40,833 --> 01:07:42,292
She's lying to us.

786
01:07:43,417 --> 01:07:46,542
That reference she gave,
she never even worked for her.

787
01:07:48,083 --> 01:07:49,167
How do you know?

788
01:07:50,125 --> 01:07:53,250
Because I chased the woman down
and I spoke to her.

789
01:07:53,333 --> 01:07:56,167
And what?
She said, "Polly didn't work for me"?

790
01:07:56,250 --> 01:07:58,583
No. No, of course not.

791
01:07:58,667 --> 01:08:00,833
I-I cornered her at this AA meeting,

792
01:08:00,917 --> 01:08:02,958
which is where they met, by the way,

793
01:08:03,042 --> 01:08:04,875
and then she lied to me again...

794
01:08:07,833 --> 01:08:09,208
That's what you were doing?

795
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:11,000
Your baby's hungry.

796
01:08:11,083 --> 01:08:13,625
-Oh, my God, I'm sorry...
-And she's sleeping.

797
01:08:15,500 --> 01:08:17,708
I'm fucking done. Let's talk tomorrow.

798
01:08:39,667 --> 01:08:40,667
Hi.

799
01:08:41,833 --> 01:08:42,833
You want to come in?

800
01:08:43,917 --> 01:08:44,917
Um...

801
01:08:45,417 --> 01:08:47,333
Could you tell me
what this is about first?

802
01:08:49,458 --> 01:08:51,000
I owe you an apology.

803
01:08:52,333 --> 01:08:53,333
I had you wrong.

804
01:08:54,208 --> 01:08:56,292
And if you're okay with it,

805
01:08:56,375 --> 01:08:59,042
I would like the opportunity to explain.

806
01:09:05,833 --> 01:09:07,458
You can have a seat anywhere.

807
01:09:09,250 --> 01:09:11,917
-Can I get you something to drink?
-I'm good.

808
01:09:17,417 --> 01:09:18,417
Uh...

809
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:20,083
What's that?

810
01:09:23,333 --> 01:09:26,250
Well, it's information.

811
01:09:28,375 --> 01:09:29,375
About me?

812
01:09:30,583 --> 01:09:31,583
Yeah.

813
01:09:34,250 --> 01:09:35,250
Like what?

814
01:09:36,042 --> 01:09:37,917
Well, I know your real name,

815
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:39,250
Rebecca.

816
01:09:41,958 --> 01:09:43,458
So, you went through my things.

817
01:09:45,750 --> 01:09:47,750
Yes, I did.

818
01:09:51,500 --> 01:09:55,458
And I know that you grew up
in San Bernardino, like Caitlin.

819
01:09:55,542 --> 01:09:57,708
But her name wasn't Caitlin.

820
01:09:57,792 --> 01:09:59,083
It was Jennifer.

821
01:10:00,833 --> 01:10:01,833
Jenny.

822
01:10:05,083 --> 01:10:07,458
And I know when you were seven,

823
01:10:08,333 --> 01:10:09,542
you lost everything,

824
01:10:09,625 --> 01:10:11,917
your whole family, in a fire.

825
01:10:14,875 --> 01:10:16,208
Yes.

826
01:10:16,292 --> 01:10:18,292
I can't begin to imagine...

827
01:10:20,167 --> 01:10:21,917
what that must have been like.

828
01:10:23,292 --> 01:10:24,292
No.

829
01:10:25,500 --> 01:10:28,167
In context here, it's important.

830
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:30,000
I mean,

831
01:10:31,375 --> 01:10:35,500
there's no true version of the story
that leaves out what you've been through.

832
01:10:35,583 --> 01:10:36,583
Yes, there is.

833
01:10:39,208 --> 01:10:40,292
That's what happened.

834
01:10:43,708 --> 01:10:45,083
She killed my parents,

835
01:10:47,417 --> 01:10:48,708
my baby sister,

836
01:10:50,875 --> 01:10:52,292
and nothing happened to her.

837
01:10:55,042 --> 01:10:57,833
They changed her name and sent her away.

838
01:11:03,458 --> 01:11:08,125
I mean, something happened to her
before the fire.

839
01:11:08,208 --> 01:11:09,292
No, that's not true.

840
01:11:13,083 --> 01:11:19,583
Regardless, I hope we can agree
that what you're doing to her now,

841
01:11:19,667 --> 01:11:23,250
to her husband, to her daughters,

842
01:11:24,417 --> 01:11:28,917
that is not right either, is it?

843
01:11:37,875 --> 01:11:38,875
Did you tell her?

844
01:11:46,042 --> 01:11:48,958
No. I wanted to talk to you first.

845
01:11:49,042 --> 01:11:51,375
But if you don't, I will.

846
01:11:52,792 --> 01:11:54,000
Uh...

847
01:11:55,542 --> 01:11:56,542
I feel sick.

848
01:11:57,250 --> 01:11:59,750
Um, can I use the bathroom?

849
01:11:59,833 --> 01:12:01,125
Yeah, of course. Um...

850
01:12:01,208 --> 01:12:04,208
It's straight through the doorway here,
just straight ahead.

851
01:12:14,958 --> 01:12:16,708
Buddy.

852
01:12:19,958 --> 01:12:21,042
You got this.

853
01:12:26,375 --> 01:12:27,917
Rebecca... Polly,

854
01:12:29,917 --> 01:12:31,167
can I get you anything?

855
01:12:34,500 --> 01:12:35,500
If it were me,

856
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:40,583
I would want the same thing you want,
to see her suffer. But...

857
01:12:42,250 --> 01:12:45,000
I would hope that
there would be someone there

858
01:12:45,083 --> 01:12:46,583
to just sympathize,

859
01:12:47,167 --> 01:12:49,208
and end the cycle of...

860
01:13:27,875 --> 01:13:29,292
Had to get in there.

861
01:13:30,833 --> 01:13:32,458
Had to be the savior.

862
01:13:56,583 --> 01:13:57,875
You made me do this.

863
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:00,583
I hope you realize that.

864
01:14:43,583 --> 01:14:45,750
-Hello?
-Caitlin, it's Bethany.

865
01:14:46,583 --> 01:14:48,375
-I'm at the hospital.
-What is it? What...

866
01:14:48,458 --> 01:14:50,417
It's Stewart.
There was a break-in. He's...

867
01:14:51,125 --> 01:14:52,625
-Oh, my God.
-He's really hurt.

868
01:14:52,708 --> 01:14:55,208
Okay, I'm coming.
I'm coming now. I'm coming.

869
01:14:58,583 --> 01:14:59,583
What's going on?

870
01:15:00,333 --> 01:15:01,708
-It's Stewart.
-What happened?

871
01:15:02,583 --> 01:15:04,500
-He's been attacked. Just...
-Oh, my God.

872
01:15:04,583 --> 01:15:06,208
-Stay with the kids, okay?
-Okay.

873
01:15:33,792 --> 01:15:35,583
-Hi.
-What's going on?

874
01:15:36,458 --> 01:15:37,875
I'm sorry. Who are you?

875
01:15:37,958 --> 01:15:39,708
I'm his best friend. How is he?

876
01:15:40,583 --> 01:15:42,042
-He...
-He's in a tough situation,

877
01:15:42,125 --> 01:15:43,167
given how he came in.

878
01:15:43,250 --> 01:15:45,500
So I went to his house
and I opened the door,

879
01:15:45,583 --> 01:15:46,667
and then he was just...

880
01:15:47,208 --> 01:15:50,375
He was just lying there on the ground,
and there was so much blood.

881
01:15:50,458 --> 01:15:52,667
-And then his jaw was just...
-The head trauma?

882
01:15:52,750 --> 01:15:54,208
-Yes.
-The break-in?

883
01:15:54,292 --> 01:15:56,125
-Yes.
-Uh...

884
01:15:56,208 --> 01:15:58,458
Sorry, officer.
I need to speak with you.

885
01:15:58,542 --> 01:15:59,792
Let me get your number,

886
01:15:59,875 --> 01:16:02,250
and then I can put you in contact
with the detective in charge.

887
01:16:02,333 --> 01:16:04,917
Stewart thought that a woman
named Polly Murphy,

888
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:08,000
that she was lying to me
and lying to my family.

889
01:16:08,708 --> 01:16:10,625
-And he was looking into her.
-Wait. Polly?

890
01:16:10,708 --> 01:16:12,167
-You mean your nanny?
-Yes.

891
01:16:12,833 --> 01:16:15,583
He believed me, Stewart.
He believed me, and she knew that.

892
01:16:15,667 --> 01:16:18,083
I'll get you in contact with the officer.
I need you...

893
01:16:18,167 --> 01:16:20,292
I'm trying to tell you
what's going on here!

894
01:16:20,375 --> 01:16:21,750
Please, listen to me.

895
01:16:21,833 --> 01:16:23,750
Ma'am, please lower your voice. Thank you.

896
01:16:23,833 --> 01:16:24,917
Come with me. Let's go.

897
01:16:25,708 --> 01:16:27,833
I'm really sorry.

898
01:16:28,833 --> 01:16:31,833
I'm... I'm gonna go to the chapel, okay?

899
01:16:32,833 --> 01:16:33,833
I'll be back.

900
01:17:08,833 --> 01:17:10,042
How is he?

901
01:17:10,833 --> 01:17:11,917
Ask her.

902
01:17:13,708 --> 01:17:15,833
-Okay. What do you...
-Get out!

903
01:17:16,708 --> 01:17:18,667
-Stop it.
-You can go, too, if you want.

904
01:17:18,750 --> 01:17:19,792
Mom.

905
01:17:19,875 --> 01:17:21,458
She's just upset about her friend.

906
01:17:21,542 --> 01:17:24,500
Stop talking to her and get out!

907
01:17:24,583 --> 01:17:25,583
Now!

908
01:17:30,167 --> 01:17:32,375
Oh, fine. Fine.

909
01:17:59,292 --> 01:18:00,500
Caitlin.

910
01:18:01,875 --> 01:18:03,833
-Caitlin, listen to me.
-No.

911
01:18:03,917 --> 01:18:05,292
I'm done. I'm done!

912
01:18:05,375 --> 01:18:07,708
Caitlin, stop! Will you...
What are you doing?

913
01:18:07,792 --> 01:18:09,500
-You, stop it!
-Will you...

914
01:18:09,583 --> 01:18:11,500
-Will you stop?
-Let me do it!

915
01:18:16,583 --> 01:18:18,083
You get away from her!

916
01:18:19,292 --> 01:18:21,292
-Caitlin, stop!
-Mom, what are you doing?

917
01:18:21,375 --> 01:18:22,708
-Stop! Get off!
-Get off me!

918
01:18:23,583 --> 01:18:24,583
No! No.

919
01:18:27,583 --> 01:18:28,750
You okay?

920
01:18:31,208 --> 01:18:32,375
Let me see. Let me see.

921
01:18:33,208 --> 01:18:35,042
You're hurt, Emma.
I wanna see. Let me.

922
01:18:35,583 --> 01:18:37,125
Let me see. Let me see. You okay?

923
01:18:41,792 --> 01:18:44,292
Come on. We'll get you up. Come on.

924
01:18:44,875 --> 01:18:46,583
Let's get you in the house.

925
01:18:58,667 --> 01:19:02,000
What we need to do is
separate the incident with Polly and Emma,

926
01:19:02,917 --> 01:19:05,042
which could lead to a restraining order.

927
01:19:05,125 --> 01:19:06,167
What about Stewart?

928
01:19:06,250 --> 01:19:08,708
Caitlin, I'm very sorry
you lost your friend,

929
01:19:08,792 --> 01:19:11,708
-but it's not going to help us.
-He texted me.

930
01:19:11,792 --> 01:19:14,958
And then he called her,
the last person, before he died.

931
01:19:15,042 --> 01:19:16,958
-She has to...
-That's being investigated.

932
01:19:17,042 --> 01:19:19,042
-We just need you to be patient.
-Fine.

933
01:19:20,958 --> 01:19:23,083
Fine. I just want to see my kids now.

934
01:19:23,167 --> 01:19:24,792
Today. I want to see them today.

935
01:19:25,667 --> 01:19:28,958
The good news is,
Miguel is willing to make that happen.

936
01:19:29,042 --> 01:19:30,917
But you need to understand,

937
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:33,250
he does still need her
to help with the kids.

938
01:19:35,875 --> 01:19:37,917
You did the right thing
moving out last week,

939
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:40,667
but honestly, Caitlin,
in light of what happened,

940
01:19:40,750 --> 01:19:43,625
the judge could raise the issue
of the children's safety

941
01:19:43,708 --> 01:19:46,583
-when they're in your care.
-They're unsafe now!

942
01:19:47,417 --> 01:19:48,917
They are with her now!

943
01:20:54,792 --> 01:20:55,917
No!

944
01:21:04,042 --> 01:21:05,282
It's okay, sweetheart.

945
01:21:05,917 --> 01:21:06,958
Mom's here.

946
01:21:09,375 --> 01:21:11,042
All right. Come on, baby. Let's go.

947
01:21:11,708 --> 01:21:12,708
Come on, go.

948
01:21:14,167 --> 01:21:15,167
Come on.

949
01:21:20,917 --> 01:21:22,750
-Hey.
-Hey.

950
01:21:26,458 --> 01:21:27,458
Did you stretch?

951
01:21:29,042 --> 01:21:30,042
Not yet.

952
01:21:32,125 --> 01:21:33,625
-Here's this.
-Thanks.

953
01:21:35,417 --> 01:21:36,458
Where's Josie?

954
01:21:39,625 --> 01:21:41,042
She was napping.

955
01:21:42,583 --> 01:21:45,042
-We agreed I could see her.
-You will.

956
01:21:46,458 --> 01:21:48,458
Dad, you staying for my game?

957
01:21:51,167 --> 01:21:52,167
That's fine with me.

958
01:21:53,583 --> 01:21:54,583
Okay.

959
01:21:55,208 --> 01:21:57,458
I'll, um... I'll go get us seats.

960
01:22:10,458 --> 01:22:11,458
You're mad at me.

961
01:22:14,208 --> 01:22:16,042
That's good. That's good. You should be.

962
01:22:20,667 --> 01:22:22,958
I'm hard on you, Emma.

963
01:22:23,042 --> 01:22:25,042
And I know I watch you too closely.

964
01:22:27,667 --> 01:22:29,875
I think because
nobody really watched out for me.

965
01:22:31,708 --> 01:22:34,458
But that's not your fault, okay?

966
01:22:35,917 --> 01:22:37,042
It's not your fault.

967
01:22:39,833 --> 01:22:41,542
Nobody watched out for you?

968
01:22:44,042 --> 01:22:45,042
No.

969
01:22:49,833 --> 01:22:51,500
I found this in Polly's room.

970
01:22:59,625 --> 01:23:00,875
I actually stole it.

971
01:23:16,542 --> 01:23:19,542
Mom... Look...

972
01:23:20,792 --> 01:23:22,542
It says a different name, but...

973
01:23:24,333 --> 01:23:25,417
that's Polly.

974
01:23:26,458 --> 01:23:27,458
See?

975
01:23:28,333 --> 01:23:30,125
She's from where you're from.

976
01:23:30,667 --> 01:23:32,333
She's an orphan.

977
01:23:32,417 --> 01:23:35,083
That's why she tries so hard
to be in our family.

978
01:23:46,333 --> 01:23:47,750
So you can come back now?

979
01:23:51,958 --> 01:23:52,958
Is that what you want?

980
01:23:53,042 --> 01:23:54,875
Players to the court.

981
01:24:00,208 --> 01:24:01,500
I'm trying, honey.

982
01:24:12,667 --> 01:24:14,417
Come on. Come on, let's go.

983
01:25:09,542 --> 01:25:10,625
Hi.

984
01:25:11,917 --> 01:25:13,583
-Josie's still sleeping.
-Rebecca.

985
01:25:18,875 --> 01:25:20,042
Do you want to come in?

986
01:25:22,042 --> 01:25:24,000
You look like you could use some water.

987
01:25:27,167 --> 01:25:28,333
Okay.

988
01:26:22,458 --> 01:26:23,542
Way to box it out.

989
01:26:26,875 --> 01:26:28,584
Hi, this is Caitlin.

990
01:26:28,667 --> 01:26:31,027
I can't come to the phone right now.
Please leave a message.

991
01:26:35,083 --> 01:26:36,792
Come on, guys. Whoo!

992
01:26:40,667 --> 01:26:43,333
Emma. Emma, we need to go home.

993
01:26:43,958 --> 01:26:45,500
-Why?
-Come on. We gotta go.

994
01:26:46,208 --> 01:26:48,042
Nice, Kayla, nice.

995
01:27:00,542 --> 01:27:01,708
I've dreamt about this.

996
01:27:04,583 --> 01:27:05,667
Meeting you.

997
01:27:11,250 --> 01:27:13,500
But I guess you've dreamt
about it even more.

998
01:27:16,792 --> 01:27:17,875
Yes.

999
01:27:22,792 --> 01:27:23,875
What should I say?

1000
01:27:29,083 --> 01:27:32,250
I'm sorry for what happened.

1001
01:27:38,458 --> 01:27:39,542
For what I did.

1002
01:27:44,792 --> 01:27:48,167
I, uh... I told the school

1003
01:27:49,708 --> 01:27:52,542
and I told my dad...

1004
01:27:53,333 --> 01:27:55,333
...what your father was doing to me,

1005
01:27:56,833 --> 01:27:58,125
and nobody believed me.

1006
01:28:00,750 --> 01:28:02,625
-Because you were lying.
-No.

1007
01:28:05,208 --> 01:28:06,417
No, he hurt me.

1008
01:28:08,125 --> 01:28:09,250
And he wouldn't stop.

1009
01:28:09,958 --> 01:28:12,417
That's bullshit.

1010
01:28:18,375 --> 01:28:20,458
You pretend like you're this good person.

1011
01:28:23,125 --> 01:28:24,125
But you're not.

1012
01:28:24,208 --> 01:28:25,833
I've tried to be but...

1013
01:28:25,917 --> 01:28:27,375
But you're trying to hide it

1014
01:28:28,625 --> 01:28:30,792
from everyone, from your family.

1015
01:28:32,625 --> 01:28:33,708
But you can't.

1016
01:28:36,833 --> 01:28:38,500
You don't know anything about me.

1017
01:28:40,500 --> 01:28:42,125
You never even met me back then.

1018
01:28:42,708 --> 01:28:44,042
Oh, but I saw you...

1019
01:28:46,375 --> 01:28:47,375
that night.

1020
01:29:36,750 --> 01:29:37,875
My parents.

1021
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:46,667
My sister was a baby.

1022
01:29:50,958 --> 01:29:54,375
And you cried and whined
about what happened to you.

1023
01:29:57,125 --> 01:29:58,958
They believed you then, didn't they?

1024
01:30:00,833 --> 01:30:02,875
-They did.
-You know what I got?

1025
01:30:02,958 --> 01:30:04,792
I got seven different houses.

1026
01:30:04,875 --> 01:30:06,625
-It wasn't right...
-Because of you!

1027
01:30:08,292 --> 01:30:10,583
Because of what you did to me.

1028
01:30:12,833 --> 01:30:13,917
Look at me.

1029
01:30:16,375 --> 01:30:18,042
Do you know

1030
01:30:18,125 --> 01:30:22,500
how much pain you caused me?

1031
01:30:29,125 --> 01:30:30,750
But you know I wasn't lying.

1032
01:30:33,917 --> 01:30:35,000
You know.

1033
01:30:35,500 --> 01:30:36,875
Because he did it to you, too.

1034
01:30:42,792 --> 01:30:43,792
He told me.

1035
01:30:46,042 --> 01:30:47,167
No.

1036
01:30:48,167 --> 01:30:49,583
How much we looked alike.

1037
01:30:51,500 --> 01:30:54,083
-That we could be sisters.
-No.

1038
01:30:57,208 --> 01:30:59,250
I've thought about you every single day.

1039
01:31:01,125 --> 01:31:02,500
What you've suffered,

1040
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:05,292
what I took from you.

1041
01:31:07,750 --> 01:31:10,333
You were alone with nothing.

1042
01:31:10,417 --> 01:31:11,542
Stop.

1043
01:31:11,625 --> 01:31:13,958
Just please believe me.
I know how that feels.

1044
01:31:17,708 --> 01:31:18,792
I'm here now.

1045
01:31:21,958 --> 01:31:23,875
I'm here for whatever you want to say.

1046
01:31:27,917 --> 01:31:29,083
What...

1047
01:31:32,042 --> 01:31:33,167
What I want...

1048
01:31:44,750 --> 01:31:47,667
...is for you to rot in hell...

1049
01:31:48,958 --> 01:31:50,708
...while I sleep in your bed...

1050
01:31:53,542 --> 01:31:55,250
...and fuck your husband,

1051
01:31:56,625 --> 01:31:58,792
and raise your beautiful daughters.

1052
01:33:03,417 --> 01:33:04,458
Okay, baby.

1053
01:33:36,042 --> 01:33:37,667
Hi. This is Caitlin.

1054
01:33:37,750 --> 01:33:39,167
-I can't come to the phone...
-Dad.

1055
01:33:39,292 --> 01:33:40,375
Come on, Emma.

1056
01:33:40,917 --> 01:33:42,000
What's happening?

1057
01:34:10,875 --> 01:34:11,875
It's okay, baby.

1058
01:34:15,667 --> 01:34:17,750
It's okay. It's okay.

1059
01:34:19,500 --> 01:34:22,833
Get out! Get out of the car!

1060
01:34:25,333 --> 01:34:26,417
It's okay.

1061
01:34:28,958 --> 01:34:30,833
Stop! No!

1062
01:34:48,083 --> 01:34:49,542
Oh, my God! Caitlin!

1063
01:34:57,750 --> 01:34:58,958
Oh, my God.

1064
01:34:59,958 --> 01:35:01,042
Oh, God.

1065
01:35:01,917 --> 01:35:03,750
Oh, God. Caitlin.

1066
01:35:07,375 --> 01:35:09,042
-I'm okay.
-You're hurt.

1067
01:35:09,125 --> 01:35:10,250
I'm okay.

1068
01:35:13,250 --> 01:35:14,542
She's okay.

1069
01:35:14,625 --> 01:35:15,708
I'm so sorry.

1070
01:35:17,958 --> 01:35:19,042
I'm sorry.

1071
01:35:19,708 --> 01:35:21,375
Let me help you. Let me help you.

1072
01:35:25,708 --> 01:35:26,750
Give me the baby.

1073
01:35:26,833 --> 01:35:28,458
Come here, sweetheart. I got you.

1074
01:35:31,250 --> 01:35:32,500
I saw her.

1075
01:35:32,583 --> 01:35:34,000
I'm so sorry.

1076
01:35:34,083 --> 01:35:35,167
Forgive me.

1077
01:35:35,750 --> 01:35:37,250
I should have listened to you.

1078
01:35:40,250 --> 01:35:41,292
It's okay.

1079
01:35:41,375 --> 01:35:42,417
It's okay.

1080
01:35:44,792 --> 01:35:46,458
Please. Send help.

1081
01:35:48,292 --> 01:35:49,375
We need an ambulance.

1082
01:37:26,542 --> 01:37:27,625
Is she coming?

1083
01:37:29,917 --> 01:37:31,000
She's with Josie.

1084
01:37:35,458 --> 01:37:37,042
This kid, she knows everything.

1085
01:37:42,417 --> 01:37:43,500
It's gonna be okay.

1086
01:37:45,833 --> 01:37:46,917
We're gonna be okay.

1087
01:38:06,833 --> 01:38:11,750
So, it was her, her parents,
and her baby sister, Olivia.

1088
01:38:13,417 --> 01:38:16,042
But then one day she had to go
live all on her own.

1089
01:38:17,958 --> 01:38:19,458
And the place Rebecca went to,

1090
01:38:20,292 --> 01:38:22,250
there was nothing to eat but tuna fish.

1091
01:38:24,333 --> 01:38:25,917
It gets even sillier than that.

1092
01:38:26,917 --> 01:38:30,875
There was no mayonnaise,
no lettuce, no bread even.

1093
01:38:31,833 --> 01:38:34,292
She had to eat the tuna
out of a can like a cat.

1094
01:38:35,667 --> 01:38:37,458
Meow.

1095
01:38:38,792 --> 01:38:40,208
When there was no more left...

1096
01:38:45,333 --> 01:38:46,833
there was nothing left to eat.
