1
00:01:09,267 --> 00:01:10,502
I love you.

2
00:01:13,238 --> 00:01:14,406
I love you.

3
00:01:37,131 --> 00:01:38,331
Love you.

4
00:02:13,569 --> 00:02:15,071
<i>How does Daddy use you?</i>

5
00:02:15,171 --> 00:02:16,673
<i>Any way he pleases.</i>

6
00:02:16,773 --> 00:02:17,573
<i>Louder.</i>

7
00:02:17,674 --> 00:02:19,241
<i>Any way he pleases.</i>

8
00:02:22,712 --> 00:02:24,446
<i>What do you do for his cum?</i>

9
00:02:24,748 --> 00:02:26,649
<i>Anything he wants me to do.</i>

10
00:02:47,371 --> 00:02:48,640
<i>Back up here.</i>

11
00:02:49,708 --> 00:02:51,643
<i>Come here.</i>

12
00:03:13,498 --> 00:03:15,067
<i>Do you like this kind of sex?</i>

13
00:03:55,810 --> 00:03:57,079
In e-commerce.

14
00:03:57,179 --> 00:03:59,915
Due to an increase in e-commerce
and fast shipping expectations

15
00:04:00,015 --> 00:04:02,117
and in the face of real estate
and labor shortages.

16
00:04:02,218 --> 00:04:06,956
Due to an increase
in e-commerce and
fast shipping expectations...

17
00:04:07,289 --> 00:04:09,390
An increase in e-commerce.

18
00:04:15,699 --> 00:04:17,067
We need to understand
what it means to be good.

19
00:04:17,167 --> 00:04:20,103
We need to learn
what it means
to protect and nurture.

20
00:04:45,796 --> 00:04:46,631
Who's Ed?

21
00:04:46,731 --> 00:04:48,531
The homeless woman downstairs.

22
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,037
I don't need them.
I'm a dancer not a hiker.

23
00:04:52,137 --> 00:04:54,773
Yeah, but we go hiking
all the time,
so you <i>do</i> need them.

24
00:04:54,873 --> 00:04:57,376
Why do you keep
wearing that apron?
It's so weird.

25
00:04:57,475 --> 00:04:58,710
-No, no. Not you. Sorry.
-You don't like it?

26
00:04:58,810 --> 00:05:00,411
-If you don't have your shoes...
-No, no, to my wife.

27
00:05:00,511 --> 00:05:02,047
...you can't come with us.
You'll be left behind.

28
00:05:02,147 --> 00:05:04,983
Did you say that you
gave your shoes away
to a homeless person?

29
00:05:05,083 --> 00:05:06,417
-Yes.
-To Ed.

30
00:05:06,517 --> 00:05:08,154
-They made me look weird.
-Well, did they fit him?

31
00:05:08,254 --> 00:05:09,956
-Her.
-Her.

32
00:05:10,056 --> 00:05:12,091
Mom, can Mary sleep over?

33
00:05:13,259 --> 00:05:13,993
Uh-uh.

34
00:05:14,093 --> 00:05:15,460
Why?

35
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:17,596
Because your mom is busy
with her company right now.

36
00:05:17,697 --> 00:05:20,465
We need peace and quiet.
These are scary times.

37
00:05:20,633 --> 00:05:22,268
No, it's not scary.
It's exciting.

38
00:05:22,368 --> 00:05:24,003
No, it's not scary.
It's exciting.

39
00:05:24,103 --> 00:05:26,407
Listen, I made some
small changes over this.

40
00:05:26,506 --> 00:05:27,775
Come on, eat your breakfast.

41
00:05:27,875 --> 00:05:30,344
-Oh.
-You're gonna be fine.

42
00:05:30,443 --> 00:05:32,279
- Hmm.
- Oh.

43
00:05:39,019 --> 00:05:40,154
Hey!

44
00:05:40,354 --> 00:05:42,423
Hey, what the fuck?
Hey, get off me!

45
00:05:42,522 --> 00:05:44,159
- Hey, get off me!
- Someone help him!

46
00:05:44,259 --> 00:05:45,592
- Oh, my God!
- Ow!

47
00:05:45,694 --> 00:05:47,362
Stop!
No, no, no, no, no!
Stop, stop, stop!

48
00:05:47,461 --> 00:05:48,730
Please!

49
00:05:48,830 --> 00:05:50,432
No, no, no, watch out!

50
00:05:50,531 --> 00:05:51,232
Come here.

51
00:05:52,767 --> 00:05:54,703
Oh, my God. Jesus Christ!

52
00:06:00,608 --> 00:06:02,244
Good girl. Good girl.

53
00:06:03,879 --> 00:06:04,647
Good girl.

54
00:06:08,050 --> 00:06:09,352
Is this your dog?

55
00:06:09,652 --> 00:06:11,954
Thank you so, so much.
I'm so sorry.

56
00:06:12,054 --> 00:06:13,189
Here you go.

57
00:06:20,364 --> 00:06:22,165
Great. Oh, I was texting you.

58
00:06:22,265 --> 00:06:23,166
-Are you okay?
-Yeah, I'm okay.

59
00:06:23,967 --> 00:06:25,369
Good. All right.

60
00:06:25,534 --> 00:06:26,937
-Do it.
-We're not late.

61
00:06:27,536 --> 00:06:29,206
<i>Amit Ray said,</i>

62
00:06:29,306 --> 00:06:32,242
"As more and more
artificial intelligence
is entering into the world,

63
00:06:32,342 --> 00:06:36,914
more and more
emotional intelligence
must enter into leadership."

64
00:06:37,015 --> 00:06:39,751
<i>We engineer accountability</i>
<i>into our products</i>

65
00:06:39,851 --> 00:06:43,388
<i>and they are changing</i>
<i>the way we live every day.</i>

66
00:06:43,488 --> 00:06:45,723
I am delighted
to introduce to you

67
00:06:45,823 --> 00:06:48,226
the newest asset
to our fleet:

68
00:06:48,326 --> 00:06:49,293
Harvest.

69
00:06:50,328 --> 00:06:51,528
-Yeah?
-Hey.

70
00:06:52,463 --> 00:06:54,033
Their response was great I hear.

71
00:06:54,133 --> 00:06:57,302
Yeah. The quote about
emotional intelligence
was very good.

72
00:06:57,403 --> 00:06:59,505
Jacob's idea.

73
00:07:00,139 --> 00:07:03,742
Uh, is now a good time
for me to introduce the interns?

74
00:07:03,842 --> 00:07:05,811
-Uh, now is good.
-Okay.

75
00:07:05,911 --> 00:07:07,279
-It's their first day, so...
-Yeah.

76
00:07:09,815 --> 00:07:11,217
Come in.

77
00:07:11,317 --> 00:07:13,386
This is our CEO, Romy Mathis.

78
00:07:13,486 --> 00:07:15,321
Hello. Welcome.

79
00:07:16,623 --> 00:07:17,891
Don't be nervous.

80
00:07:17,991 --> 00:07:20,493
We are so happy
to have you here.

81
00:07:21,127 --> 00:07:25,231
And if you have any questions,
please just let us know.

82
00:07:25,331 --> 00:07:27,566
I have a question.
Um...

83
00:07:27,667 --> 00:07:30,938
Do you really think automation
can provide a path
to sustainability

84
00:07:31,038 --> 00:07:34,875
or is that just
something people say
to make you like robots?

85
00:07:35,042 --> 00:07:37,311
Okay. Uh, let's--
Uh, let's go.

86
00:07:37,411 --> 00:07:40,181
Uh, Mrs. Mathis
is very busy today.
So, let's please go.

87
00:07:40,281 --> 00:07:41,715
Go. You. Out.

88
00:07:41,816 --> 00:07:43,517
It's her company.

89
00:07:43,951 --> 00:07:46,221
I am so sorry about that.
Do you want me to...

90
00:07:48,589 --> 00:07:49,925
Uh...

91
00:07:50,025 --> 00:07:51,093
Ah.

92
00:07:51,193 --> 00:07:52,260
-Hold on.
-Okay.

93
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:56,231
Yes. Yes. We were very happy.

94
00:07:56,498 --> 00:07:57,799
How did you feel?

95
00:08:00,535 --> 00:08:03,138
I think it was an excellent day.

96
00:08:04,974 --> 00:08:06,608
Yeah, if that's what you want

97
00:08:06,709 --> 00:08:09,512
but I think it was
a very successful beginning.

98
00:08:13,850 --> 00:08:17,453
Um, I'm sorry. Excuse me.
Um, who can apply?

99
00:08:17,553 --> 00:08:18,588
- For what?
- Oh, uh...

100
00:08:18,688 --> 00:08:20,490
Everyone.
It's a company-wide program.

101
00:08:20,590 --> 00:08:23,393
You'll receive a list of names
by email at the end of the day.

102
00:08:23,494 --> 00:08:26,897
I highly recommend it.
A mentor makes a huge difference

103
00:08:26,997 --> 00:08:28,632
in how you get
to experience the company.

104
00:08:28,732 --> 00:08:31,668
And you're all invited
to the holiday party
this Friday.

105
00:08:31,768 --> 00:08:33,370
Yes! There will be a DJ,

106
00:08:33,470 --> 00:08:36,340
so, you know,
make sure you bring
your best dancing shoes.

107
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:43,281
Good morning, Mrs. Mathis.

108
00:08:43,381 --> 00:08:44,249
Morning, Ari.

109
00:08:46,017 --> 00:08:48,353
<i>He's a problem</i>
<i>and we don't need him.</i>

110
00:08:48,453 --> 00:08:52,090
<i>It's just investor appetite</i>
<i>is huge and he can just--</i>

111
00:08:53,992 --> 00:08:54,959
Right.

112
00:08:55,126 --> 00:08:56,896
Yeah. Uh...

113
00:08:56,996 --> 00:08:59,965
Yeah, okay.
Well, whatever you decide.

114
00:09:00,499 --> 00:09:01,635
I'll play along.

115
00:09:01,734 --> 00:09:05,137
Um, hey, can you get me
a cup of coffee?

116
00:09:05,237 --> 00:09:06,505
-Yeah.
-Mm-hmm.

117
00:09:06,605 --> 00:09:08,841
Safe navigation. Flexibility.

118
00:09:15,515 --> 00:09:18,185
And? Tell him.

119
00:09:18,485 --> 00:09:21,588
I mean, technology alone
can't handle everything, can it?

120
00:09:21,788 --> 00:09:24,291
Anyway, I have to go.
All right. All right.
I've got to go. Bye.

121
00:09:24,391 --> 00:09:25,725
Um.

122
00:09:25,825 --> 00:09:29,262
Hey, how'd you get that dog
to calm down?

123
00:09:31,531 --> 00:09:33,401
I gave it a cookie.

124
00:09:33,868 --> 00:09:35,303
You always have cookies on you?

125
00:09:38,439 --> 00:09:39,407
Yeah.

126
00:09:41,309 --> 00:09:42,243
Why? Do you want one?

127
00:09:44,145 --> 00:09:45,179
No.

128
00:09:50,219 --> 00:09:52,921
You shouldn't
drink coffee after lunch.

129
00:09:53,922 --> 00:09:55,257
How many do you drink a day?

130
00:09:57,526 --> 00:09:59,761
None of your business. Seven.

131
00:10:01,664 --> 00:10:02,898
Yeah?

132
00:10:05,867 --> 00:10:07,035
All right. Tell him yes.

133
00:10:16,446 --> 00:10:18,781
Hey. Hey.

134
00:10:19,549 --> 00:10:21,217
Hmm?

135
00:10:32,596 --> 00:10:34,098
I want to see you.

136
00:10:42,974 --> 00:10:45,277
Hey, hey. Look at me. Hey.

137
00:10:54,352 --> 00:10:55,721
Oh!

138
00:11:02,663 --> 00:11:04,196
Hey.

139
00:11:04,765 --> 00:11:09,201
I want to watch porn
while you have sex with me.

140
00:11:10,771 --> 00:11:11,871
What?

141
00:11:12,639 --> 00:11:13,973
I want to.

142
00:11:21,649 --> 00:11:22,684
Okay.

143
00:11:40,468 --> 00:11:41,836
Feels weird.

144
00:11:45,606 --> 00:11:49,544
No, like this. Touch me.
I prefer this.

145
00:11:50,679 --> 00:11:52,046
You touch me.

146
00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:25,382
Yes, do it.

147
00:12:27,984 --> 00:12:30,221
Come on.

148
00:12:32,089 --> 00:12:34,091
-You do it.
-I can't like this.

149
00:12:34,191 --> 00:12:37,361
-Why?
-It makes me feel
like a villain.

150
00:12:42,466 --> 00:12:44,168
Okay. Okay.

151
00:13:09,128 --> 00:13:12,432
Being a CEO means being
a collaborator and a nurturer.

152
00:13:12,532 --> 00:13:17,303
I mean, I see myself
as a strategy expert,
but also a human expert.

153
00:13:17,403 --> 00:13:19,172
At the same time,
one-day shipping

154
00:13:19,272 --> 00:13:22,209
has dramatically upped
the stakes for all of us.

155
00:13:22,309 --> 00:13:25,379
And there's huge demand
for what we do.

156
00:13:25,479 --> 00:13:28,248
And everyone is just waiting
for us to buckle
under the pressure

157
00:13:28,348 --> 00:13:33,153
but I say, "Look up. Smile.
And never show your weakness."

158
00:13:33,253 --> 00:13:36,023
Oh, don't use "weakness"
to describe yourself.

159
00:13:36,123 --> 00:13:39,260
It's a positive
to be vulnerable,
not a negative.

160
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:40,395
Got it.

161
00:13:40,495 --> 00:13:41,563
Hey! How are you?

162
00:13:42,698 --> 00:13:44,999
Oh, look at you.

163
00:13:45,099 --> 00:13:46,634
You wore this for me?

164
00:13:46,735 --> 00:13:48,838
-Yeah. Of course.
-Beautiful.

165
00:13:49,504 --> 00:13:53,541
Come on.
How did you get her to--
You did it for me?

166
00:13:53,641 --> 00:13:56,277
-Come on.
-You guys want
a drink or anything?

167
00:13:56,578 --> 00:13:58,481
Romy, I got you a drink.

168
00:14:00,416 --> 00:14:01,250
No, thanks.

169
00:14:03,285 --> 00:14:07,089
You know, I love your name.

170
00:14:07,189 --> 00:14:09,358
-You do?
-Yeah. Where does it come from?

171
00:14:09,458 --> 00:14:10,993
Is it Polish?

172
00:14:13,562 --> 00:14:15,098
I was named by a guru.

173
00:14:15,733 --> 00:14:16,701
Seriously?

174
00:14:19,369 --> 00:14:22,372
-I grew up
in communes and cults.
-No!

175
00:14:23,406 --> 00:14:24,574
Huh.

176
00:14:24,675 --> 00:14:28,178
Oh, my God. You know,
I would never have guessed that.

177
00:14:28,278 --> 00:14:32,818
I mean, I thought that
you were raised by soldiers
or something. Or robots.

178
00:14:32,918 --> 00:14:34,318
Or something.

179
00:14:38,456 --> 00:14:41,058
I'm joking, of course.

180
00:15:01,681 --> 00:15:04,817
Do you have a lighter?
Can I borrow your lighter?

181
00:15:06,853 --> 00:15:08,187
Thanks.

182
00:15:30,411 --> 00:15:33,414
I don't like Christmas. Do you?

183
00:15:35,349 --> 00:15:36,785
-I mean,
I don't really have any--
-I was reading some-- Oh.

184
00:15:37,986 --> 00:15:39,286
-Sorry, go ahead.
-No, no. You.

185
00:15:39,386 --> 00:15:40,655
-No, no. Go ahead.
-No.

186
00:15:41,388 --> 00:15:42,156
Go.

187
00:15:49,665 --> 00:15:50,833
Oh.

188
00:15:51,734 --> 00:15:53,268
I chose you as my mentor.

189
00:15:54,704 --> 00:15:55,705
What?

190
00:15:55,805 --> 00:15:57,305
I chose you as my mentor.

191
00:15:59,742 --> 00:16:01,878
I'm not a part
of that program, so...

192
00:16:01,979 --> 00:16:03,145
Oh, you are.

193
00:16:03,814 --> 00:16:05,247
No, I'm not.

194
00:16:05,414 --> 00:16:08,085
Oh, no, you are.
You're on the list.
You're on the, um--

195
00:16:08,184 --> 00:16:10,286
I got an email
and I clicked on your name.

196
00:16:13,824 --> 00:16:15,358
You're on the list.

197
00:16:17,426 --> 00:16:18,730
Thanks for the light.

198
00:16:34,879 --> 00:16:37,382
Come on. Yeah!

199
00:16:44,355 --> 00:16:46,859
When was
the last time we danced?

200
00:16:46,959 --> 00:16:49,494
-I don't know.
-A long time ago.

201
00:16:49,594 --> 00:16:52,430
-I can't dance
with you right now.
-But they know we are married.

202
00:17:26,332 --> 00:17:29,671
Scarlett doesn't understand
<i>Hedda Gabler</i> at all.

203
00:17:30,038 --> 00:17:34,408
She thinks it's about desire.
It's not about desire.
It's about suicide.

204
00:17:35,077 --> 00:17:36,477
Mm-hmm.

205
00:17:36,577 --> 00:17:39,981
Hedda's life is over
even before the play begins.

206
00:17:40,082 --> 00:17:43,785
Before it begins. Yeah.
That makes sense. I think I...

207
00:17:43,985 --> 00:17:46,621
What are you mumbling about?
You're not making any sense.

208
00:17:46,723 --> 00:17:48,825
Are you having
a seizure or something?

209
00:17:49,158 --> 00:17:50,592
You're so rude.

210
00:17:50,693 --> 00:17:54,897
And who are you texting
the whole time?

211
00:17:54,997 --> 00:17:56,598
I'm not texting. I'm emailing.

212
00:17:56,699 --> 00:17:59,334
-As if that is a good excuse.
-Yes!

213
00:17:59,434 --> 00:18:01,037
-That is the whole problem.
-It is--

214
00:18:01,137 --> 00:18:03,005
-Come here, please. Come here.
-Okay.

215
00:18:08,846 --> 00:18:10,681
-Romy.
-What?

216
00:18:12,482 --> 00:18:16,285
Am I relevant
to you as a director?

217
00:18:16,787 --> 00:18:19,555
We are all irrelevant.

218
00:18:20,858 --> 00:18:23,194
We have to pay more attention
to the avalanche

219
00:18:23,293 --> 00:18:25,897
that is gonna cover us
all very soon.

220
00:18:56,595 --> 00:18:59,331
<i>We were a little cautious.</i>
<i>We were leery about markets.</i>

221
00:18:59,431 --> 00:19:02,301
<i>And financials are clearly</i>
<i>higher beta stocks.</i>

222
00:19:02,401 --> 00:19:04,738
<i>Uh, but those</i>
<i>who are more optimistic</i>

223
00:19:04,838 --> 00:19:08,641
<i>and those who</i>
<i>are gonna make plans,</i>
<i>who are gonna act upon a dip</i>

224
00:19:08,742 --> 00:19:12,411
<i>we would point out</i>
<i>big financials,</i>
<i>big banks, big insurance,</i>

225
00:19:12,511 --> 00:19:16,483
<i>big asset managers, uh,</i>
<i>big brokers, big exchanges.</i>

226
00:19:16,717 --> 00:19:19,687
<i>The results that are coming out</i>
<i>these companies are good.</i>

227
00:19:19,787 --> 00:19:22,924
<i>Capital markets activity is good</i>

228
00:19:23,024 --> 00:19:26,359
<i>and, uh, has potential to,</i>
<i>you know, speed up even more.</i>

229
00:19:26,459 --> 00:19:30,330
<i>But I think "big"</i>
<i>is the key theme</i>
<i>when it comes to financials.</i>

230
00:19:30,430 --> 00:19:33,836
<i>These big institutions</i>
<i>have the deposit base,</i>

231
00:19:33,936 --> 00:19:37,338
<i>they've got the confidence</i>
<i>of those who buy</i>
<i>their securities</i>

232
00:19:37,438 --> 00:19:40,641
<i>and they are</i>
<i>the ones in the position</i>
<i>to continue to invest...</i>

233
00:20:11,809 --> 00:20:13,210
<i>You're sure you don't</i>
<i>want numbing cream?</i>

234
00:20:13,376 --> 00:20:15,478
No. I'll be fine.

235
00:20:15,746 --> 00:20:17,413
This might bruise a little bit.

236
00:20:52,584 --> 00:20:55,087
<i>Five, four...</i>

237
00:20:56,155 --> 00:20:57,455
<i>three...</i>

238
00:20:58,090 --> 00:20:59,424
<i>two...</i>

239
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:01,560
<i>one.</i>

240
00:21:04,497 --> 00:21:06,499
What are you noticing now?

241
00:21:08,135 --> 00:21:09,202
What?

242
00:21:09,303 --> 00:21:10,704
What are you noticing now?

243
00:21:12,239 --> 00:21:14,308
-What are you seeing?
-Nothing.

244
00:21:14,408 --> 00:21:15,809
Okay.

245
00:21:16,076 --> 00:21:17,879
No feelings in your body?

246
00:21:22,083 --> 00:21:23,117
Come on, Isabel. Please.

247
00:21:23,217 --> 00:21:25,753
-Come on.
-Oh my God.

248
00:21:28,588 --> 00:21:30,657
Okay. Well, we got that.

249
00:21:30,758 --> 00:21:33,962
So, let's have
a look here, Emily.

250
00:21:34,062 --> 00:21:36,198
Thank you. Good.

251
00:21:36,298 --> 00:21:38,566
Do you want
to go get changed now,
please, Isabel?

252
00:21:38,834 --> 00:21:41,170
Come on. Let her wear
what she wants. It's fine.

253
00:21:41,971 --> 00:21:43,305
Come on, honey.

254
00:21:43,638 --> 00:21:44,974
You look really weird.

255
00:21:45,774 --> 00:21:47,575
Like a dead fish.

256
00:21:47,676 --> 00:21:49,778
-Hey, baby.
-You're just,
like, you know, the--

257
00:21:49,878 --> 00:21:51,080
No, come on. Enough. Enough.

258
00:21:52,547 --> 00:21:54,351
-I'm sorry, Dad. It looks awful!
-Enough! Come on!

259
00:21:54,451 --> 00:21:56,152
Go and get changed,
please, Isabel.

260
00:21:56,252 --> 00:21:57,187
Why do you do that to yourself?

261
00:21:57,287 --> 00:21:58,487
-Come on, come on.
-All right.

262
00:21:58,587 --> 00:21:59,756
Oh, fuck off.

263
00:22:01,291 --> 00:22:02,759
Will you change too, baby?

264
00:22:02,859 --> 00:22:03,793
Sure.

265
00:22:07,063 --> 00:22:10,499
Good. All right, Emily,
how about one
of just the two of us

266
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:13,104
-while we're
waiting for her to change.
-Yeah. Yeah, let's go. Okay.

267
00:22:24,782 --> 00:22:26,083
Wait. Hold the door.

268
00:22:28,787 --> 00:22:29,855
Hey.

269
00:22:29,955 --> 00:22:30,956
Hey.

270
00:22:37,029 --> 00:22:39,530
Oh, um,
I'm looking forward to Tuesday.

271
00:22:40,631 --> 00:22:42,566
Tuesday? Why?

272
00:22:42,934 --> 00:22:45,170
I got an email saying
they scheduled
the first meeting.

273
00:22:45,270 --> 00:22:46,406
The what?

274
00:22:46,506 --> 00:22:47,672
The 10-minute
introduction meeting.

275
00:22:47,774 --> 00:22:50,076
I don't know
who sent that email, but I--

276
00:22:50,176 --> 00:22:52,445
I definitely
don't have time for that.

277
00:22:52,544 --> 00:22:53,880
It's just 10 minutes.

278
00:22:57,884 --> 00:22:59,584
What's that? What is that?

279
00:23:00,286 --> 00:23:01,254
What's what?

280
00:23:02,455 --> 00:23:04,091
There's no need for the--

281
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:07,194
It looks good on you.

282
00:23:40,628 --> 00:23:44,166
Who decided to make me a part
of that mentor program,
by the way?

283
00:23:45,201 --> 00:23:47,136
Hazel thought
it'd be good for you

284
00:23:47,236 --> 00:23:51,574
to take part in some
extra activities internally.

285
00:23:51,673 --> 00:23:53,742
They say there's a talent war...

286
00:23:54,343 --> 00:23:55,744
so, I don't know

287
00:23:55,845 --> 00:23:59,249
I guess it's important to make
new talent feel involved.

288
00:23:59,549 --> 00:24:01,318
Show you're
an approachable leader.

289
00:24:03,820 --> 00:24:06,056
A talent war.

290
00:24:09,625 --> 00:24:11,995
Think we could talk
about my promotion soon?

291
00:24:13,597 --> 00:24:14,799
Of course.

292
00:24:29,646 --> 00:24:31,015
-Hey.
-Hi.

293
00:24:31,249 --> 00:24:32,284
How are you?

294
00:24:32,384 --> 00:24:33,919
You have seven minutes.

295
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:36,121
Ten. I think.

296
00:24:37,589 --> 00:24:40,225
Thanks for making the time.

297
00:24:41,126 --> 00:24:42,394
I was forced.

298
00:24:42,494 --> 00:24:43,395
What?

299
00:24:43,495 --> 00:24:44,963
Um... What?

300
00:24:46,365 --> 00:24:49,201
I didn't say anything.
Why did you want to meet here?

301
00:24:49,302 --> 00:24:50,503
You don't like this room?

302
00:24:50,603 --> 00:24:53,840
No, no, no, I like the room.
It's a nice room. It's very--

303
00:24:54,307 --> 00:24:57,944
It's got a nice vibe. I think--
It's sound-proof, which is good.

304
00:25:00,079 --> 00:25:03,383
-If I were you I'd hurry up.
-Yeah. Of course. Sorry.

305
00:25:05,518 --> 00:25:08,455
How... did...

306
00:25:08,989 --> 00:25:11,292
it... start?

307
00:25:12,693 --> 00:25:13,928
What?

308
00:25:14,161 --> 00:25:15,763
The warehouse automation dream?

309
00:25:15,863 --> 00:25:17,198
That is your question?

310
00:25:17,298 --> 00:25:18,265
Yeah.

311
00:25:18,365 --> 00:25:19,200
Google it.

312
00:25:19,300 --> 00:25:20,901
No, I just wanted
to hear it from you.

313
00:25:21,001 --> 00:25:23,771
-Why?
-Because the internet's
not reliable.

314
00:25:26,575 --> 00:25:30,946
I graduated Yale <i>cum laude.</i>
I was recruited
by an investment firm.

315
00:25:31,046 --> 00:25:32,581
The selection
process was grueling.

316
00:25:32,681 --> 00:25:35,250
There were six rooms,
they took me
into six different rooms.

317
00:25:35,350 --> 00:25:37,619
I had to answer certain
questions in each room

318
00:25:37,719 --> 00:25:39,754
and solve math formulas.

319
00:25:39,854 --> 00:25:41,691
One of the questions was
how many ping pong balls

320
00:25:41,790 --> 00:25:43,326
would fit in that specific room.

321
00:25:43,426 --> 00:25:45,428
Huh, what is--
How many would fit in here,
do you think?

322
00:25:45,528 --> 00:25:48,564
At the end, they wanted me
to solve a hypothetical case

323
00:25:48,664 --> 00:25:50,266
of a company
that was in deep trouble.

324
00:25:50,366 --> 00:25:52,735
I spent a week
trying to solve it.
I couldn't.

325
00:25:52,835 --> 00:25:55,706
So I went back in
and I told them
they could go fuck themselves.

326
00:25:55,805 --> 00:25:57,974
Did you? What did they say?

327
00:25:58,207 --> 00:25:59,375
They hired me.

328
00:25:59,475 --> 00:26:00,978
Because you were bold?

329
00:26:01,078 --> 00:26:03,313
I guess because
they were looking
for certain personalities.

330
00:26:03,547 --> 00:26:04,314
What kind?

331
00:26:08,986 --> 00:26:12,556
After five years,
I started my own company.

332
00:26:12,724 --> 00:26:14,891
I wanted
to automate repetitive tasks

333
00:26:14,992 --> 00:26:16,994
and give people their time back
by limiting--

334
00:26:17,094 --> 00:26:18,563
Power hungry personalities?

335
00:26:18,663 --> 00:26:19,664
You think that's what I am?

336
00:26:19,764 --> 00:26:22,267
No. No.

337
00:26:23,935 --> 00:26:25,704
I think the opposite.

338
00:26:25,937 --> 00:26:27,205
You think I don't like power?

339
00:26:27,305 --> 00:26:29,474
No, I think you like
to be told what to do.

340
00:26:33,511 --> 00:26:35,281
Sorry. I didn't mean to--

341
00:26:38,250 --> 00:26:40,919
Sorry, that was inappropriate.

342
00:26:41,487 --> 00:26:43,489
That was incredibly
inappropriate. I'm...

343
00:26:50,529 --> 00:26:52,164
I just want to see if I can...

344
00:26:57,003 --> 00:27:00,273
Just let me write this out.

345
00:27:00,741 --> 00:27:02,242
Okay.

346
00:27:09,316 --> 00:27:12,788
Your seven minutes is up.
Oh, this stupid pen.

347
00:27:12,887 --> 00:27:14,955
But we can definitely
have another session if--

348
00:27:15,056 --> 00:27:16,223
I mean, if that's...

349
00:27:16,324 --> 00:27:17,158
Yeah.

350
00:27:17,258 --> 00:27:20,061
...what you were hoping for.

351
00:27:20,161 --> 00:27:22,863
I have your number
already so, um...

352
00:27:22,963 --> 00:27:26,400
1,824,000 is the answer.

353
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:29,504
That's how many ping pong balls
fit in the room.

354
00:27:29,604 --> 00:27:30,906
I was just working it out.

355
00:27:33,308 --> 00:27:36,578
Wait, wait.
Just wait a second. Wait.

356
00:27:39,881 --> 00:27:41,416
- I have to go. I--
- Just wait.

357
00:27:41,516 --> 00:27:43,885
Close the door a second.
Just close the door a second.

358
00:28:31,704 --> 00:28:33,938
No. No, no.

359
00:28:34,038 --> 00:28:36,441
-No?
-I'm so sorry.

360
00:28:36,674 --> 00:28:38,176
That shouldn't have happened.

361
00:28:38,276 --> 00:28:40,847
-It's okay.
-It's not okay. I'm so sorry.

362
00:28:40,980 --> 00:28:44,016
It's fine. It's okay. It's okay.

363
00:28:47,319 --> 00:28:49,688
Shit. Um, great. Thank you.

364
00:28:49,790 --> 00:28:51,123
Okay. Thank you.

365
00:28:54,761 --> 00:28:56,296
<i>Mom!</i>

366
00:28:57,431 --> 00:28:58,999
<i>Mom!</i>

367
00:29:56,292 --> 00:29:58,428
-Can you do that?
-Mm.

368
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:17,414
Watch out.

369
00:30:18,182 --> 00:30:20,184
-Ew.
-Oh, God.

370
00:30:24,154 --> 00:30:26,124
Do you like
the girl from next door?

371
00:30:28,828 --> 00:30:30,195
What are you talking about?

372
00:30:32,264 --> 00:30:34,199
How old is she? 17?

373
00:30:37,235 --> 00:30:39,170
I thought you were
in love with Mary.

374
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:44,176
I am in love with Mary.

375
00:30:44,510 --> 00:30:46,612
I was just having fun
with Ophelia.

376
00:30:49,750 --> 00:30:52,385
<i>At Tensile, we care</i>

Oh, wait.

383
00:31:17,077 --> 00:31:18,847
Hey, wait, wait, wait.
Can I ask you something?

384
00:31:18,948 --> 00:31:20,582
Sorry. Why didn't you respond?

385
00:31:20,682 --> 00:31:22,450
Um, to what?

386
00:31:22,550 --> 00:31:24,619
We're supposed to meet weekly,
but you didn't respond
to the email.

387
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:25,754
They sent an email.

388
00:31:25,854 --> 00:31:27,522
I'm sorry. I have to go.
I have an appointment.

389
00:31:27,622 --> 00:31:29,557
No, no. It's really--
It's very, very simple.

390
00:31:29,657 --> 00:31:31,659
There's a--
There should have been
a link in your email,

391
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:34,262
you click on it and select
the date and time
for the second appointment.

392
00:31:34,362 --> 00:31:36,332
I'm sorry. I have to go.

393
00:31:36,565 --> 00:31:41,037
If you don't want
to be my mentor,
I understand, but...

394
00:31:41,136 --> 00:31:43,505
but I do want one
because it makes...

395
00:31:43,606 --> 00:31:45,274
- Hello, Mrs. Mathis.
- A big difference.

396
00:31:45,374 --> 00:31:47,376
And so there's lots
of other people
I can ask.

397
00:31:47,476 --> 00:31:49,045
You know what I mean?
So it just--

398
00:31:49,144 --> 00:31:50,346
Are you done?

399
00:31:50,714 --> 00:31:52,147
With?

400
00:31:52,682 --> 00:31:56,721
Do you understand your behavior
is totally out of line?

401
00:31:58,121 --> 00:31:59,122
Is it?

402
00:31:59,824 --> 00:32:01,058
Yes.

403
00:32:01,391 --> 00:32:03,094
Well, we're supposed
to meet weekly.

404
00:32:03,193 --> 00:32:05,228
I didn't make the rules on that.
You know?

405
00:32:07,064 --> 00:32:09,165
Okay, sure. I'll think about it.

406
00:32:09,265 --> 00:32:10,334
-Okay.
-Good.

407
00:32:10,434 --> 00:32:13,071
Perfect. Thank you.

408
00:32:13,270 --> 00:32:14,372
Appreciate that.

409
00:32:25,216 --> 00:32:27,218
<i>Wait. Wait.</i>

410
00:32:30,222 --> 00:32:32,224
<i>Wait. Wait.</i>

411
00:32:35,762 --> 00:32:38,296
That's what comes of sneaking in
by the back way.

412
00:32:38,931 --> 00:32:41,000
Are you out of your senses?

413
00:32:41,266 --> 00:32:42,935
I'm shooting at you,
Judge Brack!

414
00:32:43,036 --> 00:32:45,237
No! No! Do not shoot at me!

415
00:32:45,337 --> 00:32:47,941
Did I happen to hit you? Whoops.

416
00:32:50,844 --> 00:32:51,945
I wish you would leave
these pranks alone.

417
00:32:58,752 --> 00:33:02,388
You're not really happy.
That's what's
at the bottom of it.

418
00:33:03,758 --> 00:33:05,259
Hey!

419
00:33:05,659 --> 00:33:07,095
I know of no reason
why I shouldn't be happy.

420
00:33:07,194 --> 00:33:08,963
It's amazing!

421
00:33:09,164 --> 00:33:10,497
-Uh, uh...
-Perhaps you can give me one?

422
00:33:10,597 --> 00:33:11,565
Thank you.

423
00:33:15,937 --> 00:33:17,337
What are you doing here?

424
00:33:18,338 --> 00:33:20,843
Watching you
in your natural habitat.

425
00:33:22,677 --> 00:33:23,713
Oh, good.

426
00:33:24,180 --> 00:33:25,748
Wow.

427
00:33:26,148 --> 00:33:27,883
Last time you did that was...

428
00:33:29,719 --> 00:33:33,089
1997, when you thought
I was having an affair

429
00:33:33,189 --> 00:33:35,356
with a lighting technician.

430
00:33:35,457 --> 00:33:37,592
- What's going on?
- I'm coming!

431
00:33:38,694 --> 00:33:40,296
Don't you have to be at work?

432
00:33:40,931 --> 00:33:41,732
Mm...

433
00:33:45,035 --> 00:33:46,569
Okay, let's do this thing again.

434
00:33:46,669 --> 00:33:48,471
This thing with the gun.
It's almost like a--

435
00:33:50,941 --> 00:33:53,009
- Hi.
- Hi.

436
00:33:55,478 --> 00:33:56,748
Your party's right there.

437
00:33:59,183 --> 00:34:00,852
-I'm Natalie.
-Natalie.

438
00:34:03,087 --> 00:34:04,454
We here?

439
00:34:09,060 --> 00:34:11,661
-You finally came! Hi.
-I did.

440
00:34:11,763 --> 00:34:13,697
You know,
we have been begging her

441
00:34:13,799 --> 00:34:16,769
to come get a drink with us
for over a year.

442
00:34:16,869 --> 00:34:18,937
Really?

443
00:34:19,037 --> 00:34:21,173
-Hazel.
-Yes.

444
00:34:21,272 --> 00:34:25,177
There is something
I wanted to run past you.

445
00:34:25,744 --> 00:34:27,913
I don't know, I was thinking
wouldn't it be...

446
00:34:29,313 --> 00:34:32,417
amazing to focus more
on recruiting women?

447
00:34:32,518 --> 00:34:34,120
We are. And we do.

448
00:34:34,220 --> 00:34:36,122
-No, I know. I know.
-Listen to her.

449
00:34:36,222 --> 00:34:38,390
But, I don't know,
wouldn't it be cool

450
00:34:38,490 --> 00:34:40,860
if there was some sort
of program within the company

451
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:43,462
to, I don't know,
help young female employees

452
00:34:43,562 --> 00:34:45,664
-find their way
to the top easier?
-Got you.

453
00:34:45,765 --> 00:34:48,567
You know what,
let me tell you this,
write a proposal for me.

454
00:34:48,667 --> 00:34:49,469
Of course! Sorry.
It's all right.

455
00:34:49,569 --> 00:34:50,838
I know you didn't, but--

456
00:34:50,938 --> 00:34:53,774
But just put it in an email
and we'll figure it out.

457
00:34:53,874 --> 00:34:54,942
-Okay.
-See?

458
00:34:55,042 --> 00:34:57,945
-Email me. You have my email.
-Okay. Okay.

459
00:34:59,445 --> 00:35:01,347
-She's the best.
I'm telling you.
-I understand.

460
00:35:01,447 --> 00:35:03,083
She is adorable.

461
00:35:03,184 --> 00:35:05,886
She's enthusiastic.
 I don't have enough going on right now--

462
00:35:05,986 --> 00:35:08,223
- I--
You really don't, okay?

463
00:35:08,322 --> 00:35:09,657
We can go toe-to-toe.

464
00:35:11,927 --> 00:35:12,961
What is this?

465
00:35:15,030 --> 00:35:16,564
Did you order this?

466
00:35:17,132 --> 00:35:20,302
Uh, no, I did not.
I'll get him to take it away.

467
00:35:20,401 --> 00:35:21,970
- No, it's--
- Excuse me.

468
00:35:29,045 --> 00:35:33,049
Are you gonna drink that?
Don't drink that.

469
00:35:37,253 --> 00:35:38,386
Should we all do one?

470
00:35:46,096 --> 00:35:46,964
I'm impressed.

471
00:35:57,908 --> 00:35:58,942
Thank you.

472
00:36:01,813 --> 00:36:02,914
Good girl.

473
00:36:07,551 --> 00:36:09,087
<i>And what will I do</i>
<i>in the evenings?</i>

474
00:36:09,187 --> 00:36:11,189
<i>Oh, I dare say</i>
<i>Judge Brack will be so kind</i>

475
00:36:11,289 --> 00:36:13,324
<i>as to look in now and then.</i>

476
00:36:13,423 --> 00:36:15,226
<i>Happily. We'll have a ball.</i>

477
00:36:15,326 --> 00:36:18,731
<i>Oh, yes, you'd love that,</i>
<i>wouldn't you, Judge Brack?</i>

478
00:36:18,831 --> 00:36:21,166
<i>To be the only cock in my run.</i>

479
00:36:21,267 --> 00:36:22,935
<i>Oh, now she's playing</i>
<i>with those pistols again.</i>

480
00:37:01,541 --> 00:37:03,510
-It was so good.
-Thank you.

481
00:37:07,782 --> 00:37:11,485
Congratulations.
You should be so happy.

482
00:37:12,254 --> 00:37:14,156
Romy! Hey!

483
00:37:14,256 --> 00:37:17,759
Hi, Stephen. You were wonderful!

484
00:37:17,859 --> 00:37:21,129
Thank you. Thank you.
So how's things
in the robot business?

485
00:37:22,731 --> 00:37:25,267
Do you have a phone addiction?
You know, that's a thing.

486
00:37:25,367 --> 00:37:27,235
No, Stephen I have a job.

487
00:37:28,670 --> 00:37:32,375
-I loved it. I just loved it.
-You did? Good.

488
00:37:32,474 --> 00:37:33,608
-Huge success.
-Say hello to her.

489
00:37:33,709 --> 00:37:36,611
-Hi, how are you?
-Yes. You were amazing.

490
00:37:36,712 --> 00:37:39,415
-Thank you. Thank you.
-Amazing. You made me cry.

491
00:37:39,715 --> 00:37:42,385
I have to go because
I have this work emergency.

492
00:37:42,484 --> 00:37:46,457
Hold on, hold on.
It's the one night
that I need you by my side.

493
00:37:46,556 --> 00:37:48,826
-I know. I'm so sorry.
-Baby. Baby.

494
00:37:48,926 --> 00:37:50,127
I have to go.

495
00:37:50,361 --> 00:37:55,565
Uh, it was wonderful, everyone!
I loved it. Absolutely loved it.

496
00:38:00,070 --> 00:38:02,006
Bye. So good to see you.

497
00:39:01,069 --> 00:39:02,036
Hello?

498
00:39:54,358 --> 00:39:55,392
Oh, you're here.

499
00:40:02,066 --> 00:40:03,100
Sit down.

500
00:40:13,178 --> 00:40:15,713
We need to have
a conversation about this...

501
00:40:15,814 --> 00:40:17,616
This is... It's...

502
00:40:17,715 --> 00:40:20,718
What you're doing is wrong.

503
00:40:21,553 --> 00:40:23,889
Your behavior is unacceptable.

504
00:40:23,989 --> 00:40:25,558
-What behavior?
-That's all I have to say.

505
00:40:25,657 --> 00:40:29,929
That's the only reason I'm here.
To stop this
and your wild behavior.

506
00:40:30,363 --> 00:40:31,264
What are you talking about?

507
00:40:32,532 --> 00:40:34,400
What am I talking about?

508
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:38,670
Leaving me notes. Texting me.
Calling me. Sending me milk.

509
00:40:38,771 --> 00:40:41,174
-Are you fucking insane?
-You drank it all.

510
00:40:41,274 --> 00:40:45,711
Keeping me waiting
in this disgusting hotel.

511
00:40:45,812 --> 00:40:48,015
-I mean,
I don't wait for anything.
-Sorry, no.

512
00:40:48,115 --> 00:40:49,850
-And that may not be
what you mean.
-I'm confused though

513
00:40:49,950 --> 00:40:52,920
because you want me to--
I don't really know how to--

514
00:40:53,020 --> 00:40:57,424
What do you want
from me because...
you show up here--

515
00:40:57,958 --> 00:41:00,727
You don't know me,
I'm a stranger--
Dressed like this.

516
00:41:01,095 --> 00:41:03,298
You expect me
to just look at you
and not do anything?

517
00:41:03,398 --> 00:41:06,634
I'm not some thing
you can just pick up
and play with.

518
00:41:06,733 --> 00:41:09,337
Shut the fuck up. Just shut up.

519
00:41:11,639 --> 00:41:14,209
-Get on your knees.
-No! What?

520
00:41:14,309 --> 00:41:15,243
Get on your knees now.

521
00:41:15,877 --> 00:41:17,446
No!

522
00:41:21,617 --> 00:41:23,586
I don't know how to-- I'm just--

523
00:41:23,686 --> 00:41:28,123
Is that what you want?
I don't know.
Is that-- Be honest.

524
00:41:32,194 --> 00:41:33,329
I don't know.

525
00:41:35,098 --> 00:41:37,500
You're very young.
I don't want to hurt you.

526
00:41:37,601 --> 00:41:38,802
Hurt me?

527
00:41:43,773 --> 00:41:46,476
I think I have power over you

528
00:41:46,576 --> 00:41:49,512
because I could make one call
and you lose everything.

529
00:41:54,018 --> 00:41:55,786
What? Does that turn you on
when I say that?

530
00:41:59,390 --> 00:42:00,458
Get on your knees.

531
00:42:18,477 --> 00:42:20,946
No, I have to go.

532
00:42:21,046 --> 00:42:22,881
This is unacceptable.

533
00:42:22,981 --> 00:42:24,483
-Unacceptable?
-I have to go. Yes.

534
00:42:30,223 --> 00:42:31,858
Oh...

535
00:42:31,958 --> 00:42:33,793
No. I don't like that.
Not like that.

536
00:42:33,893 --> 00:42:35,061
-Not like that.
-What?

537
00:42:35,161 --> 00:42:36,963
Not like that.
I don't want it like that.

538
00:42:54,381 --> 00:42:55,349
Stop!

539
00:42:57,985 --> 00:43:01,455
Open your eyes. Please.

540
00:43:10,699 --> 00:43:12,867
Here. Get up.

541
00:43:17,439 --> 00:43:18,873
Hold my hand.

542
00:43:41,598 --> 00:43:44,634
Maybe take your clothes off.
Can you do that?

543
00:43:44,735 --> 00:43:45,569
Uh-uh.

544
00:43:45,669 --> 00:43:47,604
-I don't want to.
-Why?

545
00:43:48,004 --> 00:43:50,006
I don't know. I don't want to.

546
00:43:50,808 --> 00:43:51,942
That's okay.

547
00:43:53,577 --> 00:43:54,644
It's fine.

548
00:43:58,082 --> 00:44:00,218
Just, maybe, come sit here?

549
00:44:03,354 --> 00:44:04,389
Come sit here.

550
00:44:17,002 --> 00:44:18,971
Yeah, that's it.

551
00:44:27,513 --> 00:44:29,081
Maybe could you, um...

552
00:44:31,618 --> 00:44:33,319
get on all fours?

553
00:44:34,889 --> 00:44:36,089
Why?

554
00:44:36,289 --> 00:44:38,491
Can you just try it
and stop asking why?

555
00:44:38,591 --> 00:44:41,561
Can you just try, maybe,
for the sake of what we're...

556
00:44:58,012 --> 00:44:59,280
Go back.

557
00:45:28,711 --> 00:45:30,246
-Mm-hmm.
-Mm-hmm.

558
00:45:42,426 --> 00:45:43,393
Spit it out.

559
00:45:46,831 --> 00:45:48,031
Spit it out.

560
00:46:14,860 --> 00:46:15,693
All right.

561
00:47:46,091 --> 00:47:49,060
-No, I can't. I can't. I can't.
-No. No. No. It's okay.

562
00:47:49,159 --> 00:47:51,629
-No, I can't. I can't.
-Just wait. Hold on.

563
00:47:51,729 --> 00:47:53,230
Just a second.

564
00:48:01,171 --> 00:48:05,443
I'm gonna pee.
I don't want to pee.

565
00:48:05,610 --> 00:48:06,812
I can't let--

566
00:48:09,714 --> 00:48:10,783
I can't.

567
00:49:55,459 --> 00:49:56,862
Hey, good morning.

568
00:49:57,695 --> 00:49:59,363
Whoop! Ah!

569
00:49:59,798 --> 00:50:02,600
Sorry.

570
00:50:06,671 --> 00:50:08,473
-You wanted to see me?
-Yes. Just for a minute.

571
00:50:08,573 --> 00:50:09,574
Can you close the door?

572
00:50:18,383 --> 00:50:19,618
Oh, yeah.

573
00:50:19,718 --> 00:50:20,987
Oh, Samuel!

574
00:50:22,721 --> 00:50:26,592
Okay, um,
Havest is surpassing
all of our expectations.

575
00:50:26,692 --> 00:50:28,829
We're super excited about it.

576
00:51:01,763 --> 00:51:02,730
I want you.

577
00:51:19,282 --> 00:51:20,583
Why don't you clean that up?

578
00:52:02,560 --> 00:52:05,931
It was so rude.
Oh, my God. She's dancing.

579
00:52:06,031 --> 00:52:06,865
It's where I get it from.

580
00:52:06,965 --> 00:52:09,567
- I can't dance.
- Too much.

581
00:52:10,236 --> 00:52:13,505
-You're incredible.
-All right, everyone,
<i>bon appetit.</i>

582
00:52:13,772 --> 00:52:16,209
She was helping.
She's never done that.

583
00:52:16,309 --> 00:52:19,279
I know. Yeah, I know.

584
00:52:19,444 --> 00:52:22,115
They seem so happy together.
It's wonderful.

585
00:52:22,215 --> 00:52:23,615
-Yes.
-I like Mary, too.

586
00:52:23,715 --> 00:52:26,418
I think she's a great girl.
Good for her.

587
00:52:26,518 --> 00:52:28,521
-Yes.
-Nice.

588
00:53:18,274 --> 00:53:19,809
Where'd you go to school?

589
00:53:20,410 --> 00:53:22,545
What's your favorite color?
- Purple.

590
00:53:22,645 --> 00:53:24,281
-Yes, me too!
-Yeah?

591
00:53:24,381 --> 00:53:27,451
Yeah!
What does your mom do?

592
00:53:27,550 --> 00:53:28,885
She was a teacher.

593
00:53:28,986 --> 00:53:31,421
And your dad's
in, like, security?

594
00:53:31,520 --> 00:53:32,956
Yeah, yeah.

595
00:53:33,056 --> 00:53:35,624
Well, he was a fighter first.
Like a professional fighter.

596
00:53:35,725 --> 00:53:38,762
And then he became
like private security for VIPs

597
00:53:38,863 --> 00:53:40,764
and political leaders,
things like that.

598
00:53:41,899 --> 00:53:43,633
Yeah, he did that for a while.

599
00:53:43,734 --> 00:53:46,104
Worked for some pretty
high-profile people.

600
00:53:46,204 --> 00:53:48,072
And then, um, yeah,

601
00:53:48,172 --> 00:53:52,010
he retrained,
became a philosophy teacher,
up in Illinois.

602
00:53:52,110 --> 00:53:54,846
So I used to go
visit him quite a lot.

603
00:53:54,946 --> 00:53:56,015
But, uh...

604
00:53:56,115 --> 00:53:58,450
yeah, he was a really smart man.
You know?

605
00:53:58,549 --> 00:54:00,986
Really complicated,
incredibly tough.

606
00:54:01,086 --> 00:54:05,124
You know, he was impressive.
He used to write
these beautiful poems.

607
00:54:05,224 --> 00:54:06,325
Hey.

608
00:54:06,657 --> 00:54:08,626
Oh, hey.
You forgot your laptop
at the office.

609
00:54:08,726 --> 00:54:10,362
Esme told me to bring it to you.

610
00:54:10,462 --> 00:54:14,000
Oh, she couldn't organize
a messenger?

611
00:54:14,100 --> 00:54:16,836
We thought better
in person because
of sensitive information.

612
00:54:17,037 --> 00:54:18,038
I took the train.

613
00:54:18,138 --> 00:54:20,407
Is that a new dress?
You look hot.

614
00:54:20,507 --> 00:54:24,244
-Ew! Hot?
That's disgusting, Dad.
-Do you work with the robots?

615
00:54:24,344 --> 00:54:26,578
No, no. Not directly.
I'm only an intern.
I'm not allowed.

616
00:54:26,678 --> 00:54:28,081
Do you get paid?

617
00:54:28,181 --> 00:54:30,417
Yeah, yeah. Of course I do.
And I work at a bar.

618
00:54:30,517 --> 00:54:32,053
-What bar?
-The Nines.

619
00:54:32,153 --> 00:54:35,022
I'm a dancer. Do you want
to see me dance
the tarantella? Yay!

620
00:54:35,122 --> 00:54:38,159
No, no. Come on.
We've got plans now.
Sit. Nora, please.

621
00:54:38,259 --> 00:54:40,895
-You should come hiking with us.
-No, no, that's okay.

622
00:54:40,995 --> 00:54:43,730
-No, I'll leave you guys to it.
-No, no. He needs to leave.

623
00:54:43,831 --> 00:54:45,632
-No, no, you're gonna
love the property.
-It's fun.

624
00:54:53,707 --> 00:54:55,609
Save me! Help!

625
00:54:55,944 --> 00:54:57,711
You are never safe!

626
00:54:57,813 --> 00:55:00,348
<i>I really like your family.</i>
<i>They're so nice.</i>

627
00:55:00,449 --> 00:55:02,484
That's something I want later.

628
00:55:02,583 --> 00:55:04,752
Don't ever show up at my house
like that again.

629
00:55:04,853 --> 00:55:05,619
Huh?

630
00:55:06,322 --> 00:55:08,224
I was just doing my job.

631
00:55:08,324 --> 00:55:12,995
My family is everything to me.
Don't you ever,
ever do that again.

632
00:55:18,334 --> 00:55:20,803
-Wait. Wait, wait. Just wait.
-Will you unlock the car?

633
00:55:20,903 --> 00:55:22,472
-Would you just wait, please?
-Please just unlock the car.

634
00:55:22,572 --> 00:55:24,740
-Okay.
I need you to listen to me.
-Let me out. I want to get out.

635
00:55:24,842 --> 00:55:27,244
We just have to calm down.
And we have to talk about this

636
00:55:27,344 --> 00:55:32,516
because I feel like
I wasn't expecting you
to show up at my house.

637
00:55:34,684 --> 00:55:36,652
And I don't think we can...

638
00:55:39,490 --> 00:55:42,994
I don't think
we can see each other
outside of work anymore.

639
00:55:48,699 --> 00:55:50,135
Get off me. Don't touch me.

640
00:55:57,708 --> 00:56:00,146
Romy, you know
I don't want a--

641
00:56:00,513 --> 00:56:01,580
I don't want a girlfriend,

642
00:56:01,679 --> 00:56:03,015
if that's what you're afraid of.

643
00:56:03,115 --> 00:56:03,849
-No.
-Okay?

644
00:56:03,949 --> 00:56:05,251
Because you look like a mother

645
00:56:05,351 --> 00:56:06,819
-and I'm not interested in that.
-Thank you.

646
00:56:06,919 --> 00:56:09,355
Well, it's true,
so I'm not interested in that.

647
00:56:14,759 --> 00:56:17,998
I thought what
we were doing, was like,
you know, in my mind...

648
00:56:18,298 --> 00:56:21,201
I see it as this thing
where we're like...

649
00:56:21,902 --> 00:56:23,503
you know,
we're two children playing
and that's natural.

650
00:56:23,603 --> 00:56:24,838
Come on,
you're not a fucking child.

651
00:56:24,938 --> 00:56:27,340
-Oh, whatever.
Let me out the car.
-No.

652
00:56:28,275 --> 00:56:29,843
-Unlock the car.
-No.

653
00:56:29,943 --> 00:56:31,311
-Unlock the car.
-No.

654
00:56:31,411 --> 00:56:32,612
-Unlock the car.
-No.

655
00:56:32,711 --> 00:56:33,980
Unlock the fucking car!

656
00:56:34,080 --> 00:56:35,650
-Okay, it's okay.
-Now you're making me mad.

657
00:56:35,749 --> 00:56:36,651
All right. Shh!

658
00:56:36,750 --> 00:56:38,085
I don't want to feel like this.

659
00:56:38,186 --> 00:56:39,320
-Okay, shh!
-Why are you
making me like this?

660
00:56:44,025 --> 00:56:46,227
- Okay, listen.
- No, you make--

661
00:56:46,327 --> 00:56:49,230
Yeah. It's confusing.

662
00:56:49,430 --> 00:56:50,798
-Yeah. Yeah, it is.
-Yeah.

663
00:56:50,898 --> 00:56:54,870
For you. For me.
Whatever this is, I don't know.

664
00:56:54,970 --> 00:56:57,439
So, you're very young.

665
00:56:57,673 --> 00:56:59,041
-No, I'm not.
-You are.

666
00:56:59,141 --> 00:57:00,142
No, I'm not.

667
00:57:01,443 --> 00:57:02,811
I'm not gonna--

668
00:57:04,613 --> 00:57:06,181
I mean, I'm not gonna fire you.

669
00:57:07,282 --> 00:57:08,749
But we have
to keep it professional.

670
00:57:08,850 --> 00:57:10,153
What the fuck does that mean?

671
00:57:11,221 --> 00:57:13,423
I'm just trying
to take care of you here.

672
00:57:13,523 --> 00:57:15,291
-You're taking care of me?
-Yeah.

673
00:57:15,992 --> 00:57:16,859
No.

674
00:57:24,701 --> 00:57:25,734
Oh.

675
00:57:41,285 --> 00:57:43,587
<i>Welcome back in arguably</i>
<i>one of the most exciting</i>

676
00:57:43,687 --> 00:57:45,557
<i>developments</i>
<i>in warehouse robotics.</i>

677
00:57:45,657 --> 00:57:49,461

678
00:57:49,561 --> 00:57:51,563
<i>to their newest product Harvest.</i>

679
00:58:38,246 --> 00:58:40,415
-Good morning.
-Hey, good morning.

680
00:58:40,515 --> 00:58:42,517
-Thank you so much.
I appreciate it.
-Oh, thank you.

681
00:58:42,617 --> 00:58:44,118
-Good morning.
-Morning.

682
00:58:44,218 --> 00:58:49,524
Look at this.
I didn't even ask for it.
Very bright kid.

683
00:58:49,824 --> 00:58:52,226
Anyway, I want to talk to you

684
00:58:52,327 --> 00:58:55,497
about the tapes
that Hazel sent us.

685
00:58:55,798 --> 00:58:58,200
Um, you--
you can relax a little.

686
00:58:58,300 --> 00:59:00,502
You don't have
to be scared of their questions.

687
00:59:00,602 --> 00:59:05,341
Yes. Yes, I was a little tense.
I get that. Um...

688
00:59:05,441 --> 00:59:06,942
No need. No need.

689
00:59:07,042 --> 00:59:09,311
You've done it
a million times before.

690
00:59:11,280 --> 00:59:15,452
Uh, excuse me.
I am gonna have
to take this, Sebastian.

691
00:59:19,155 --> 00:59:20,090
Hey.

692
00:59:23,626 --> 00:59:25,729
-Are you okay?
-Yeah.

693
00:59:26,096 --> 00:59:27,597
-What's wrong?
-I'm fine.

694
00:59:27,697 --> 00:59:28,998
I just, um--

695
00:59:29,099 --> 00:59:31,135
I don't feel comfortable
working for you anymore.

696
00:59:33,170 --> 00:59:34,438
I'm gonna talk to someone.

697
00:59:34,538 --> 00:59:36,907
Ask to be transferred
to a different department.

698
00:59:37,341 --> 00:59:38,943
-You can't do that.
-I can.

699
00:59:39,043 --> 00:59:40,678
You can't.
They'll ask questions.

700
00:59:40,778 --> 00:59:42,279
They'll investigate.
They can't--

701
00:59:42,380 --> 00:59:44,816
You can't do that.
They could fire me.

702
00:59:45,116 --> 00:59:47,051
It's for the best.
For both of us.

703
00:59:47,151 --> 00:59:51,690
What? What? Come on.
Wait! Wait!

704
00:59:51,790 --> 00:59:53,291
Shit.

705
01:00:26,427 --> 01:00:28,295
You want to play a little bit?

706
01:00:29,430 --> 01:00:30,431
Yeah.

707
01:00:33,200 --> 01:00:34,601
Just a little bit.

708
01:00:53,421 --> 01:00:54,656
Get out.

709
01:00:56,658 --> 01:00:57,759
Why did you do that?

710
01:01:02,933 --> 01:01:06,702
I have never
had an orgasm with you.

711
01:01:08,604 --> 01:01:09,538
What?

712
01:01:11,842 --> 01:01:13,042
What? Baby.

713
01:01:13,142 --> 01:01:15,578
Don't fucking touch me.

714
01:01:17,280 --> 01:01:18,482
I can't.

715
01:01:20,116 --> 01:01:21,819
I can't come with you.

716
01:01:23,753 --> 01:01:26,289
Are you all right? Hey.

717
01:01:26,958 --> 01:01:28,124
No.

718
01:01:57,723 --> 01:01:58,690
Hey.

719
01:02:19,679 --> 01:02:21,581
Josh. Come here a second.

720
01:02:26,854 --> 01:02:28,155
Okay.

721
01:02:31,525 --> 01:02:33,394
I think it's time to leave.

722
01:02:35,362 --> 01:02:38,232
I need to talk to him.

723
01:02:38,332 --> 01:02:41,135
I'm sorry,
but he says you need to leave.

724
01:02:41,235 --> 01:02:43,170
-He said that?
-Yes. Right now.

725
01:03:15,638 --> 01:03:18,741
Did you order the headphones
for Isabel's birthday?

726
01:03:18,842 --> 01:03:19,809
Mm-hmm.

727
01:03:20,477 --> 01:03:21,445
Good.

728
01:03:23,113 --> 01:03:24,448
Did you, uh...

729
01:03:26,483 --> 01:03:29,152
Did you mean
what you said about never...

730
01:03:31,823 --> 01:03:35,059
I was just taking it out on you.
I didn't know what I was saying.

731
01:03:35,158 --> 01:03:38,363
I was stressed.
Of course I didn't mean it.

732
01:03:39,832 --> 01:03:41,532
It's been 19 years.

733
01:03:41,633 --> 01:03:45,971
It's just normally women,
you know that--

734
01:03:46,071 --> 01:03:49,942
I'm not normal.
I'm not other women.

735
01:03:50,042 --> 01:03:51,877
Look at me. I'm not normal.

736
01:03:53,177 --> 01:03:54,445
No, you're not.

737
01:04:07,259 --> 01:04:09,029
All right. Hi.

738
01:04:11,163 --> 01:04:12,498
I have seven minutes.

739
01:04:12,598 --> 01:04:13,633
Oh.

740
01:04:13,733 --> 01:04:14,902
Yeah.

741
01:04:16,169 --> 01:04:17,671
Did you talk to them already?

742
01:04:19,840 --> 01:04:20,908
You're sweating.

743
01:04:21,008 --> 01:04:24,644
Oh, sorry. Shit.

744
01:04:25,112 --> 01:04:27,148
-Do you want to lose everything?
-What?

745
01:04:27,480 --> 01:04:28,581
You give that impression.

746
01:04:30,350 --> 01:04:32,586
What do you mean?

747
01:04:32,787 --> 01:04:36,657
The way you look at me.
As if you're expecting me
to do that.

748
01:04:36,757 --> 01:04:38,126
To take it all away.

749
01:04:38,325 --> 01:04:39,493
Oh...

750
01:04:39,593 --> 01:04:40,628
No.

751
01:04:40,862 --> 01:04:42,864
-Are you using me to do that?
-No, of course not.

752
01:04:42,964 --> 01:04:45,934
-Because that scares
the shit out of me.
-No. I'm not doing that. I--

753
01:04:46,600 --> 01:04:49,972
I just think
because you're young
and I'm older than you

754
01:04:50,073 --> 01:04:54,010
I want to be protective
and I don't want to hurt you.

755
01:04:54,110 --> 01:04:55,711
You keep saying that. But I'm--

756
01:04:55,811 --> 01:04:56,812
I'm-- I'm okay.

757
01:04:59,281 --> 01:05:00,950
I think you're
the one that's hurting.

758
01:05:07,024 --> 01:05:09,126
You don't have
to worry about it.
It's not--

759
01:05:09,225 --> 01:05:10,928
It's--

760
01:05:13,696 --> 01:05:15,199
What we do is--

761
01:05:15,298 --> 01:05:17,734
If we continue
to do this, it's normal.

762
01:05:17,901 --> 01:05:19,335
As long as it's consensual.

763
01:05:19,435 --> 01:05:20,636
What does that mean?

764
01:05:20,737 --> 01:05:22,638
Well, it's about giving
and taking power, no?

765
01:05:22,739 --> 01:05:25,877
Come on. What did you do?
Go to a library, look that up?

766
01:05:25,977 --> 01:05:27,277
Oh no. It's--

767
01:05:27,377 --> 01:05:28,947
I'm just saying it has nothing
to do with your business

768
01:05:29,047 --> 01:05:30,982
or your family.
It's between us.

769
01:05:31,082 --> 01:05:34,284
I'm sorry. I'm...

770
01:05:34,384 --> 01:05:35,920
I'm nervous.

771
01:05:36,020 --> 01:05:36,921
-You're nervous?
-Yes.

772
01:05:37,021 --> 01:05:38,322
Yeah. You look nervous.

773
01:05:39,289 --> 01:05:41,426
You're all-- You're acting all--

774
01:05:45,030 --> 01:05:48,633
Why are you nervous?
Why are you so nervous?

775
01:05:53,705 --> 01:05:57,042
Just to be safe,
if we're going to do this,
we need to set some rules

776
01:05:57,143 --> 01:05:58,643
that you and I both agree on.

777
01:05:58,879 --> 01:06:00,412
I think. Um...

778
01:06:02,348 --> 01:06:04,583
Like, I don't know,
starting with...

779
01:06:06,752 --> 01:06:08,654
I tell you what
to do and you do it.

780
01:06:08,754 --> 01:06:11,024
-Oh, come on.
Jesus Christ! Okay.
-Oh, look, this is what I mean.

781
01:06:11,124 --> 01:06:13,492
-This is what I'm talking about.
-No, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

782
01:06:13,592 --> 01:06:16,229
No, no, no, no, no. Wait.
Come on. Sit down.

783
01:06:16,328 --> 01:06:20,034
Come on. It's okay.
Sit back down. Please.

784
01:06:29,844 --> 01:06:32,213
You have to be
the one to say it out loud.
That's how it works.

785
01:06:32,345 --> 01:06:35,716
-How what works? I don't--
-This. The dynamic.
It's about trust.

786
01:06:35,817 --> 01:06:37,685
I thought you said
it had to be consensual.

787
01:06:37,785 --> 01:06:41,156
Yeah, that's what
consent is, Romy.
That's what it is.

788
01:06:41,256 --> 01:06:45,393
That's what consent is.
You have to agree to it.
You have to--

789
01:06:46,028 --> 01:06:49,330
Both parties have
to agree to it.
That's what consent is.

790
01:06:54,037 --> 01:06:56,306
-And if I don't?
-Then I'll go talk to someone.

791
01:06:56,405 --> 01:06:57,941
No, don't do that. Please.

792
01:06:59,976 --> 01:07:01,777
Oh, come on.
Just admit that this
is what you want.

793
01:07:01,878 --> 01:07:02,811
Be honest.

794
01:07:08,918 --> 01:07:12,990
You don't look
comfortable at all.
I think you should sit there.

795
01:07:13,456 --> 01:07:15,658
Sit on the table.
On the edge. Right there.

796
01:07:34,145 --> 01:07:35,914
Okay, you need to say it,

797
01:07:36,014 --> 01:07:38,316
otherwise I'm gonna have
to go talk to someone
and asked to be transferred.

798
01:07:38,415 --> 01:07:39,817
-No, wait. Wait.
-I'll go talk to--

799
01:07:39,918 --> 01:07:41,052
-No. What are the words?
What are the words?

800
01:07:41,152 --> 01:07:42,686
-You know the words.
-I don't.

801
01:07:42,786 --> 01:07:44,421
-I don't know them.
-You do.

802
01:07:44,588 --> 01:07:46,959
-Just say it.
-Okay. What? I'll say it.

803
01:07:50,930 --> 01:07:52,932
- I need you to just say it.
- Okay.

804
01:07:54,867 --> 01:07:56,501
What do you want me to say?

805
01:07:57,435 --> 01:07:58,703
-I will do...
-I will do...

806
01:07:58,803 --> 01:08:00,472
...whatever you tell me to do.

807
01:08:00,572 --> 01:08:02,408
Whatever you tell me...

808
01:08:04,177 --> 01:08:07,747
...to do.
I will do whatever
you tell me to do.

809
01:08:07,848 --> 01:08:10,716
-Say it again.
-I'll do whatever
you tell me to do.

810
01:08:11,385 --> 01:08:12,551
Good.

811
01:08:51,459 --> 01:08:52,827
-Hey.
-Hi.

812
01:09:01,503 --> 01:09:03,940
Oh, hey, there's
a whole living room in here.

813
01:09:19,622 --> 01:09:21,058
Nope. Stay.

814
01:09:32,371 --> 01:09:33,738
Take your panties off.

815
01:09:37,508 --> 01:09:38,609
Okay.

816
01:09:53,126 --> 01:09:54,093
Open your legs.

817
01:10:01,700 --> 01:10:02,935
Take your hands away.

818
01:10:05,737 --> 01:10:08,008
-How does that make you feel?
-Um, scared.

819
01:10:08,108 --> 01:10:08,942
Really?

820
01:10:11,378 --> 01:10:14,647
Okay, you want
to take your dress off
for me now so I can see?

821
01:10:15,849 --> 01:10:16,850
Mm-mm.

822
01:10:17,951 --> 01:10:19,286
But you're gonna do it anyway.

823
01:10:20,387 --> 01:10:21,288
Yes.

824
01:10:22,256 --> 01:10:23,525
Yes, what?

825
01:10:23,824 --> 01:10:25,692
Yeah, I'll take my dress off.

826
01:11:13,844 --> 01:11:15,345
You're so beautiful.

827
01:11:15,445 --> 01:11:16,347
-No, I'm not.
-You are.

828
01:11:16,447 --> 01:11:17,248
No.

829
01:11:24,489 --> 01:11:25,722
You are.

830
01:11:30,094 --> 01:11:31,095
No, I'm not.

831
01:11:31,195 --> 01:11:32,497
-Yeah.
-I'm not.

832
01:11:32,597 --> 01:11:33,730
You are.

833
01:11:37,903 --> 01:11:39,271
You're my babygirl.

834
01:11:48,447 --> 01:11:49,414
Go ahead.

835
01:13:55,047 --> 01:13:56,349
What's the safe word?

836
01:13:56,750 --> 01:13:57,684
Hmm?

837
01:13:57,783 --> 01:13:58,852
Shouldn't we have a safe word?

838
01:14:00,620 --> 01:14:01,921
Um...

839
01:14:03,456 --> 01:14:04,391
Jacob.

840
01:14:06,493 --> 01:14:07,394
Your husband's name?

841
01:14:09,795 --> 01:14:10,964
Okay.

842
01:15:30,849 --> 01:15:32,384
Will you do your, um...

843
01:15:32,484 --> 01:15:33,518
...your therapy on me?

844
01:15:34,919 --> 01:15:36,554
- No.
- Why?

845
01:15:36,654 --> 01:15:40,392
I'm not--
Because I'm not
a therapist and...

846
01:15:40,825 --> 01:15:42,628
You're afraid
of what might come up?

847
01:15:50,903 --> 01:15:52,471
You think I'm a bad person?

848
01:15:55,207 --> 01:15:57,443
No, I think you're
a lovely person.

849
01:16:00,046 --> 01:16:03,683
And I think you know things.
You sense things...

850
01:16:05,385 --> 01:16:08,422
...about people.
What they want. What they need.

851
01:16:12,159 --> 01:16:14,361
Sometimes I scare myself.

852
01:16:17,665 --> 01:16:19,434
I'm not scared of you.

853
01:16:21,335 --> 01:16:22,170
No.

854
01:16:27,842 --> 01:16:29,343
What star sign are you?

855
01:16:34,016 --> 01:16:35,551
I don't believe in that shit.

856
01:16:43,425 --> 01:16:44,593
Can you hold me?

857
01:17:22,868 --> 01:17:24,201
Your mother's gonna
cut the cake.

858
01:17:24,301 --> 01:17:25,871
I'm gonna cut it for you.
You wanna do the first one?

859
01:17:26,070 --> 01:17:27,105
-Oh, come on.
-Oh, come on.

860
01:17:27,205 --> 01:17:28,707
You wanna do it.
You wanna do it.

861
01:17:30,275 --> 01:17:32,979
Yes! Good!
Don't touch the bottom.

862
01:17:33,078 --> 01:17:34,513
-Go for it! Go for it!
-Don't touch--

863
01:17:35,780 --> 01:17:37,182
-That's okay.
-That's okay.

864
01:17:37,282 --> 01:17:39,184
Yeah, yeah, I got it.

865
01:17:39,284 --> 01:17:42,854
No. No.
I couldn't recognize you.
For Christ sake.

866
01:17:45,625 --> 01:17:47,326
Yeah. Wait there.

867
01:17:53,733 --> 01:17:54,800
Oh, hey.

868
01:17:54,902 --> 01:17:56,736
-Hi.
-Hi. Come in.

869
01:17:57,603 --> 01:17:59,238
Oh...

870
01:17:59,338 --> 01:18:01,975
-For Isabel, of course.
-Hey.

871
01:18:02,442 --> 01:18:05,445
-How are you?
-Yes. You brought her a gift.

872
01:18:05,646 --> 01:18:06,713
Come through.

873
01:18:06,813 --> 01:18:08,348
You don't mind, do you?

874
01:18:08,917 --> 01:18:10,018
Um, no.

875
01:18:11,785 --> 01:18:15,389
There she is.
There's the girl of the moment.

876
01:18:15,489 --> 01:18:19,560
- Isabel, look who's here!
Say hi.
- Hi, gorgeous.

877
01:19:00,437 --> 01:19:01,237
What?

878
01:19:03,373 --> 01:19:04,574
What are you doing here?

879
01:19:05,609 --> 01:19:06,610
What do you mean?

880
01:19:07,344 --> 01:19:08,478
Why are you here?

881
01:19:09,779 --> 01:19:10,714
You're with her?

882
01:19:11,348 --> 01:19:12,750
We see each other.

883
01:19:13,051 --> 01:19:15,453
What does that mean? What?

884
01:19:15,553 --> 01:19:17,154
Well, what did
you want me to say?
"No, I can't come..."

885
01:19:17,254 --> 01:19:19,057
Are you dating her?

886
01:19:19,156 --> 01:19:21,059
Isn't that man
in there your husband?

887
01:19:21,158 --> 01:19:23,227
I don't want you
seeing other women.

888
01:19:23,327 --> 01:19:27,099
I don't want--
You're mine. You're mine.

889
01:19:27,198 --> 01:19:28,332
Hey.

890
01:19:30,134 --> 01:19:31,603
Everything okay?

891
01:19:31,703 --> 01:19:34,339
Yeah. Yeah. I was just seeing
if I could help with anything.

892
01:19:34,439 --> 01:19:36,976
Yes, please.
Can you clean that up?

893
01:19:37,076 --> 01:19:40,612
I think, um...
this needs a sweep.

894
01:19:41,446 --> 01:19:43,649
Uh, it's a lovely party.

895
01:19:43,749 --> 01:19:44,951
-It is a lovely party.
-It is. Isn't it?

896
01:19:45,051 --> 01:19:46,251
She's having such a great time.

897
01:19:46,351 --> 01:19:47,419
Such a nice party.

898
01:19:47,519 --> 01:19:49,123
Yeah, it's lovely.

899
01:19:49,288 --> 01:19:52,859
-Really nice. You need anything?
-No, I'm good.

900
01:20:06,707 --> 01:20:07,741
Come in.

901
01:20:09,476 --> 01:20:11,046
Hi. You wanted to see me?

902
01:20:11,146 --> 01:20:12,546
Mm-hmm.

903
01:20:13,647 --> 01:20:15,516
- Sit down.
- Okay.

904
01:20:17,118 --> 01:20:21,089
Yeah, I just wanted to check in.

905
01:20:21,188 --> 01:20:22,690
How are you?

906
01:20:22,790 --> 01:20:24,793
Uh, I'm well. Thank you.

907
01:20:24,894 --> 01:20:25,627
Mm.

908
01:20:26,628 --> 01:20:27,629
How's Samuel?

909
01:20:29,664 --> 01:20:30,432
Um...

910
01:20:30,532 --> 01:20:31,700
What?

911
01:20:33,601 --> 01:20:35,104
I thought we were gonna talk--

912
01:20:35,203 --> 01:20:36,538
Mm-hmm.

913
01:20:36,638 --> 01:20:40,241
But I just wanted to see
if you're okay because, um...

914
01:20:40,341 --> 01:20:42,244
...we're gonna be talking
about your future soon.

915
01:20:42,344 --> 01:20:43,446
No, yeah. No, I know. That's--

916
01:20:43,546 --> 01:20:45,581
And you have
to be careful, Esme.

917
01:20:46,682 --> 01:20:48,284
He's an intern.

918
01:20:48,651 --> 01:20:51,787
I don't want
to dramatize this, but, uh...

919
01:20:53,289 --> 01:20:55,825
...you're in a position
of power over him.

920
01:20:56,960 --> 01:20:58,896
Is this because of the party?

921
01:20:58,996 --> 01:21:00,831
Because I-- I genuinely

922
01:21:00,932 --> 01:21:03,266
didn't think that
it would be a problem and...

923
01:21:04,135 --> 01:21:06,436
Sorry. I guess I just hadn't

924
01:21:06,536 --> 01:21:08,672
thought about it
in that way before.

925
01:21:08,772 --> 01:21:11,441
It's all good.
I just want to protect you,
that's all.

926
01:21:19,283 --> 01:21:20,886
It never stops.

927
01:21:23,688 --> 01:21:26,691
Uh, this is Isabel,
I just have to--

928
01:21:26,791 --> 01:21:27,926
Hey, um...

929
01:21:28,026 --> 01:21:29,962
- Hey.
<i>- I want to see you tonight.</i>

930
01:21:39,638 --> 01:21:42,307
<i>I'm gonna have to,</i>
<i>uh, work late.</i>

931
01:21:43,442 --> 01:21:45,511
<i>No, you don't have to wait up.</i>

932
01:21:47,046 --> 01:21:51,684
<i>Would you tell Isabel that, um,</i>
<i>she has soccer tomorrow?</i>

933
01:21:53,319 --> 01:21:55,522
<i>And Nora is doing dance, right?</i>

934
01:21:59,226 --> 01:22:01,061
She can sleep in.
I'll wake her up.

935
01:22:06,299 --> 01:22:08,735
Okay. Well, I'll just sneak in.

936
01:22:12,873 --> 01:22:13,741
Bye.

937
01:22:14,910 --> 01:22:15,911
Love you.

938
01:25:32,084 --> 01:25:35,854
You know that cuckoo birds,
they lay eggs
in others birds' nests?

939
01:25:35,955 --> 01:25:37,089
What?

940
01:25:41,161 --> 01:25:45,731
The cuckoo chicks,
they grow up thinking...

941
01:25:46,033 --> 01:25:48,368
- ...they're in
a different place.

942
01:25:48,468 --> 01:25:51,171
And they create chaos.
Total chaos.

943
01:25:51,271 --> 01:25:53,140
-You're not a bird.
-I am.

944
01:25:56,243 --> 01:25:59,981
<i>Do you do with her,</i>
<i>what you do with me?</i>

945
01:26:01,115 --> 01:26:02,083
No.

946
01:26:04,252 --> 01:26:05,685
She's not like that.

947
01:26:07,055 --> 01:26:11,159
That's why I like her
differently from you.

948
01:26:11,259 --> 01:26:14,896
That's why
I like myself differently
when I'm with her.

949
01:26:34,317 --> 01:26:35,318
Hey.

950
01:26:40,589 --> 01:26:42,225
You're still up.

951
01:26:53,471 --> 01:26:54,939
I'm worried about you.

952
01:26:55,239 --> 01:26:58,242
Oh, I'm fine. I'm fine.

953
01:26:58,708 --> 01:27:01,312
It's just been very busy
the past few weeks.

954
01:27:02,179 --> 01:27:03,314
But it's done.

955
01:27:04,381 --> 01:27:06,317
We've accomplished a lot.

956
01:27:07,650 --> 01:27:08,954
Are you okay?

957
01:27:10,322 --> 01:27:11,356
Yes.

958
01:27:14,226 --> 01:27:15,527
Are you okay?

959
01:27:15,626 --> 01:27:17,395
Yeah.

960
01:27:18,662 --> 01:27:21,066
- How's Mary?
- Good.

961
01:27:22,234 --> 01:27:23,201
She's good.

962
01:27:25,604 --> 01:27:27,140
Oh.

963
01:27:28,975 --> 01:27:30,042
Bedtime.

964
01:27:33,546 --> 01:27:35,481
Here. Did you want some more?
Come on.

965
01:27:36,582 --> 01:27:38,184
Finish the bacon, would you?

966
01:27:39,519 --> 01:27:40,652
I got it.

967
01:27:40,752 --> 01:27:42,854
-I'll get it.
-No, no. No. It's fine.

968
01:27:44,824 --> 01:27:46,859
You know we never win.

969
01:27:47,961 --> 01:27:49,930
It's also just practice today.

970
01:27:54,067 --> 01:27:55,369
Who is it?

971
01:27:55,701 --> 01:27:56,836
Esme.

972
01:27:56,937 --> 01:27:57,905
Hi.

973
01:27:58,138 --> 01:28:00,274
All right, ladies. We are late.

974
01:28:00,374 --> 01:28:01,208
-Hey.
-Come on.

975
01:28:02,243 --> 01:28:03,144
Um...

976
01:28:03,244 --> 01:28:04,646
-Bye, Mom.
-Bye.

977
01:28:05,013 --> 01:28:06,680
Bye-bye, baby.
Hey, nice to see you.

978
01:28:06,780 --> 01:28:07,949
-Yeah, you too.
-Bye.

979
01:28:09,017 --> 01:28:09,716
Yeah.

980
01:28:09,816 --> 01:28:10,884
Are you all right?

981
01:28:16,157 --> 01:28:17,691
Romy, uh...

982
01:28:20,728 --> 01:28:23,265
I-- I genuinely...

983
01:28:24,732 --> 01:28:26,701
...believed that...

984
01:28:27,102 --> 01:28:29,471
...women with power
would behave differently.

985
01:28:32,608 --> 01:28:33,775
What does that mean?

986
01:28:35,544 --> 01:28:36,679
I just-- I--

987
01:28:36,778 --> 01:28:39,583
I tried so many times
to talk to you

988
01:28:39,683 --> 01:28:42,152
about my future
at the company and...

989
01:28:43,886 --> 01:28:46,156
Yes. Of course. I'm sorry.

990
01:28:47,157 --> 01:28:48,091
Oh...

991
01:28:50,126 --> 01:28:52,696
I mean, we can discuss it now.

992
01:28:52,795 --> 01:28:54,431
It's been
a very hard time, Esme--

993
01:28:54,531 --> 01:28:59,704
Romy, I-- I don't want you
to make any promises

994
01:28:59,803 --> 01:29:02,106
because you're afraid of me.

995
01:29:03,474 --> 01:29:05,042
Why would I be afraid of you?

996
01:29:09,813 --> 01:29:13,452
I know what's going on
between you and Samuel.

997
01:29:16,655 --> 01:29:20,259
And I only want what I deserve.

998
01:29:20,758 --> 01:29:23,629
Okay? Not what's given to me
to silence me.

999
01:29:23,729 --> 01:29:25,397
That's-- that's--

1000
01:29:25,497 --> 01:29:28,333
And it's how
it might have worked
when you were younger, but...

1001
01:29:28,700 --> 01:29:29,935
What are you talking about?

1002
01:29:31,770 --> 01:29:33,373
You will never see Samuel again.

1003
01:29:35,408 --> 01:29:37,776
You will be a good leader.

1004
01:29:38,344 --> 01:29:42,015
You will create
more opportunities for women
within this company.

1005
01:29:42,482 --> 01:29:45,285
And you will be a good example
and role model to us all.

1006
01:29:48,522 --> 01:29:52,226
You're confusing ambition
with morality.
They're very different.

1007
01:29:53,994 --> 01:29:56,829
I have no interest
in taking you down.

1008
01:29:57,331 --> 01:30:02,236
Okay? Fuck,
you're one of the few women
who actually made it to the top.

1009
01:30:02,736 --> 01:30:04,538
My interest is
in keeping you there.

1010
01:30:08,076 --> 01:30:10,011
Not as you are now, but...

1011
01:30:11,246 --> 01:30:13,982
...as a version of you
that I can look up to.

1012
01:30:18,720 --> 01:30:20,588
-Okay?
-Okay. Thank you.

1013
01:30:29,332 --> 01:30:31,167
Hey. Here you are.

1014
01:30:33,536 --> 01:30:34,537
What's going on?

1015
01:30:37,306 --> 01:30:38,240
Are you okay?

1016
01:30:40,677 --> 01:30:42,079
I need to, um...

1017
01:30:45,315 --> 01:30:46,350
Tell me. Tell me.

1018
01:30:49,019 --> 01:30:51,054
Ever since I was, um...

1019
01:30:51,154 --> 01:30:53,390
Ever since I was very little...

1020
01:30:53,490 --> 01:30:54,558
Ever... little...

1021
01:30:54,658 --> 01:30:56,426
like, since I can remember,

1022
01:30:56,526 --> 01:31:01,566
I've had these specific thoughts
in my head.

1023
01:31:03,301 --> 01:31:04,302
What thoughts?

1024
01:31:04,736 --> 01:31:06,237
Um...

1025
01:31:07,605 --> 01:31:09,941
Dark. Dark thoughts.

1026
01:31:10,041 --> 01:31:12,343
Dark ideas. Disgusting.

1027
01:31:12,443 --> 01:31:16,915
And I would do anything
to be able to get rid of them.

1028
01:31:18,250 --> 01:31:21,620
Because I see myself
as this smart woman.

1029
01:31:21,720 --> 01:31:24,089
This very smart,
strong woman who--

1030
01:31:25,924 --> 01:31:29,094
Getting things done. In control.

1031
01:31:29,361 --> 01:31:31,463
-I'm very loving...
-I know.

1032
01:31:31,563 --> 01:31:34,768
...and caring, and responsible,
and I-- I want to--

1033
01:31:34,868 --> 01:31:36,069
I want to--

1034
01:31:36,169 --> 01:31:39,072
I want to work on myself
and be a good person.

1035
01:31:39,172 --> 01:31:41,408
I want to be-- But I'm--

1036
01:31:42,675 --> 01:31:44,377
I'm not. I'm not.

1037
01:31:44,477 --> 01:31:47,213
-What are you trying to say?
-I'm just saying--
I'm saying every--

1038
01:31:47,313 --> 01:31:50,316
I've tried.
I've tried everything.
I've tried all this therapy.

1039
01:31:50,417 --> 01:31:52,653
I thought it was connected
to my childhood.

1040
01:31:52,753 --> 01:31:55,222
My fucking childhood
and all the--

1041
01:31:55,322 --> 01:31:58,626
-But it's not.
I was born-- I was--
-What do you mean?

1042
01:31:58,726 --> 01:32:00,461
I was born like this.

1043
01:32:00,561 --> 01:32:01,462
What do you mean?

1044
01:32:03,998 --> 01:32:07,601
I wanted you to do,
maybe, something,

1045
01:32:07,701 --> 01:32:09,037
but you're not into it.

1046
01:32:09,137 --> 01:32:10,505
I know you're--

1047
01:32:10,605 --> 01:32:12,541
-Into what exactly, Romy?
-I just want to be normal.

1048
01:32:12,641 --> 01:32:14,709
I want to be normal.

1049
01:32:15,143 --> 01:32:19,147
-Hey. Come on.
-You. I want to be
what <i>you</i> like.

1050
01:32:19,247 --> 01:32:22,117
I want to be the woman <i>you</i> like.

1051
01:32:22,217 --> 01:32:24,519
-This is all very confusing.
-I know.

1052
01:32:24,619 --> 01:32:27,089
-Can you be
a little bit more specific?
-Yes.

1053
01:32:27,190 --> 01:32:33,596
I've never experienced any
of these fantasies in my head

1054
01:32:33,696 --> 01:32:35,898
in real life.

1055
01:32:35,998 --> 01:32:38,401
I haven't because I-- I--

1056
01:32:38,501 --> 01:32:39,669
Until I...

1057
01:32:40,703 --> 01:32:42,538
I met this...

1058
01:32:43,372 --> 01:32:45,108
You met...

1059
01:32:45,944 --> 01:32:47,678
Who? Who did you meet?

1060
01:32:49,313 --> 01:32:51,048
Uh... I--

1061
01:32:55,018 --> 01:32:57,187
-Do I know this person?
-No.

1062
01:32:59,924 --> 01:33:02,627
-No, you don't.
-It's no one at your...

1063
01:33:02,727 --> 01:33:04,996
No. It was just a man.

1064
01:33:05,096 --> 01:33:06,898
Uh, just--

1065
01:33:06,998 --> 01:33:08,366
Just a stranger.

1066
01:33:10,068 --> 01:33:12,470
-How many times?
-Just once.

1067
01:33:12,770 --> 01:33:13,939
Are you in love with him?

1068
01:33:14,038 --> 01:33:16,441
No, I'm not. It's just...

1069
01:33:18,610 --> 01:33:20,346
Oh, this is so...

1070
01:33:21,447 --> 01:33:22,581
Uh...

1071
01:33:24,450 --> 01:33:28,654
It's not about a safe word,
or a safe place,
or consent, or--

1072
01:33:28,754 --> 01:33:33,192
or the kink, kind of.
It's not that. It has to be--

1073
01:33:33,292 --> 01:33:37,297
There has to be danger.
Like, things have
to be at stake.

1074
01:33:37,397 --> 01:33:39,199
Really at stake
and it's obscene.

1075
01:33:39,299 --> 01:33:42,536
And it's as if this monster
is just sort of there.

1076
01:33:42,636 --> 01:33:45,505
So what did he do to you?
- That will destroy us, and me--

1077
01:33:45,605 --> 01:33:48,875
-What did he do to you?
-It's over now.
That's what I'm saying.

1078
01:33:48,976 --> 01:33:53,713
I don't even know
what his name is
because it's not about us.

1079
01:33:53,813 --> 01:33:56,684
It's not. It is not me.

1080
01:33:56,784 --> 01:34:00,254
-This is not about our family.
-It has everything
to do with you, Romy.

1081
01:34:00,354 --> 01:34:02,690
-It's a good thing.
-You know that it's not
excuse for this.

1082
01:34:02,790 --> 01:34:05,059
-Not your mom.
Not your childhood.
-It's out of my system.

1083
01:34:05,159 --> 01:34:07,194
-You just fucking lied to me.
-I've done it. No.

1084
01:34:07,295 --> 01:34:09,263
-To us.
-Jacob, you're not
listening to me.

1085
01:34:09,363 --> 01:34:12,901
-I love you. Only you.
-"Something has to be at stake"?

1086
01:34:13,002 --> 01:34:16,638
For Christ's sake!
What the fuck, Romy!

1087
01:34:17,506 --> 01:34:18,574
You know what?

1088
01:34:18,674 --> 01:34:21,643
I don't give a shit about your--
your pathetic,

1089
01:34:21,743 --> 01:34:25,847
banal sexual fantasies
because it's not about that!

1090
01:34:29,318 --> 01:34:32,121
You jeopardized
the most important thing.

1091
01:34:32,689 --> 01:34:34,123
Our children!

1092
01:34:36,492 --> 01:34:37,594
For what?

1093
01:34:38,194 --> 01:34:39,997
I love you.

1094
01:34:40,096 --> 01:34:42,432
You know all of this is--
is making me sick.

1095
01:34:45,069 --> 01:34:46,502
I want you...

1096
01:34:48,006 --> 01:34:50,407
I want you out of this house.

1097
01:34:51,208 --> 01:34:53,544
Out! Now!

1098
01:34:55,779 --> 01:34:56,880
Fuck that!

1099
01:36:07,288 --> 01:36:08,556
You have to go!

1100
01:36:09,490 --> 01:36:10,692
What?

1101
01:36:10,792 --> 01:36:12,560
You have to leave.

1102
01:36:12,827 --> 01:36:13,895
Help me out then.

1103
01:36:23,106 --> 01:36:24,573
I could drown you right here.

1104
01:36:25,641 --> 01:36:26,742
You should.

1105
01:36:28,011 --> 01:36:29,645
No one would even
know it was me.

1106
01:36:39,789 --> 01:36:41,257
<i>Did I mess with your head?</i>

1107
01:36:42,159 --> 01:36:43,293
Yeah.

1108
01:36:44,461 --> 01:36:46,596
Yeah, you did, but, um...

1109
01:36:47,064 --> 01:36:51,535
...but I messed with yours too,
so we're equally responsible.

1110
01:36:51,635 --> 01:36:52,903
No.

1111
01:36:53,171 --> 01:36:57,408
I mean...
that doesn't make it okay.

1112
01:36:58,642 --> 01:37:00,745
I think we're okay. We're even.

1113
01:37:01,213 --> 01:37:02,981
But it's not okay
what I've done.

1114
01:37:13,291 --> 01:37:15,460
Just, just-- No, just--

1115
01:37:16,028 --> 01:37:18,764
Leave me alone
with him a second.
No, no, no!

1116
01:37:18,864 --> 01:37:19,765
-Just give me five minutes,
please.

1117
01:37:19,865 --> 01:37:21,633
-Calm down.
You need to calm down.

1118
01:37:21,733 --> 01:37:23,602
-and step outside with me.
-Don't do that!
Please don't do that.

1119
01:37:23,702 --> 01:37:25,303
-I'm asking you
for five minutes.
-Just come with me.

1120
01:37:25,403 --> 01:37:27,174
-I want you to step outside--
-Jacob. Jacob.

1121
01:37:27,273 --> 01:37:28,942
No, no! Stop! Stop it!

1122
01:37:29,042 --> 01:37:31,911
-You motherfucker! Stay back!
-Please! Okay!

1123
01:37:34,847 --> 01:37:36,415
God, no, no!

1124
01:37:36,984 --> 01:37:37,951
Please! Don't!

1125
01:37:43,992 --> 01:37:45,626
Stop! No!

1126
01:37:45,859 --> 01:37:47,394
No, no, no. Please.

1127
01:37:51,166 --> 01:37:53,268
No, no. Please.

1128
01:37:53,767 --> 01:37:55,903
I felt sorry for you,
motherfucker!

1129
01:37:56,004 --> 01:37:57,138
No!

1130
01:38:08,683 --> 01:38:09,684
Thanks.

1131
01:38:21,298 --> 01:38:23,833
No, no, no.
Sit down. Sit down. Sit down.

1132
01:38:25,035 --> 01:38:26,535
Sit down, please.

1133
01:38:30,739 --> 01:38:31,874
Yeah.

1134
01:38:40,151 --> 01:38:41,685
What did you do to him?

1135
01:38:45,488 --> 01:38:46,923
She used you.

1136
01:38:49,293 --> 01:38:51,862
She abused you.
You know that, right?

1137
01:38:53,930 --> 01:38:58,237
Humiliation, submission,
domination, whatever
you want to call it.

1138
01:38:58,337 --> 01:39:01,039
It's just neurotic, right?

1139
01:39:01,472 --> 01:39:05,344
Female masochism
is nothing but a male fantasy.

1140
01:39:05,443 --> 01:39:08,013
-It's a male construct--
-No. No, you're wrong.

1141
01:39:08,113 --> 01:39:09,413
It's, uh...

1142
01:39:10,349 --> 01:39:11,883
That's a dated idea.

1143
01:39:13,253 --> 01:39:14,486
A dated idea?

1144
01:39:14,586 --> 01:39:16,990
Yeah, it's a dated idea
of sexuality.

1145
01:39:18,557 --> 01:39:20,659
I'm sorry,
but you don't understand.

1146
01:39:32,973 --> 01:39:34,041
Are you okay?

1147
01:39:34,275 --> 01:39:35,575
Oh, shit.

1148
01:39:37,244 --> 01:39:39,313
-Jacob.
-No. No. Not you.

1149
01:39:42,849 --> 01:39:44,751
Here. Drink some water. Come on.

1150
01:39:44,851 --> 01:39:46,686
What's happening?
You can't breathe?

1151
01:39:46,786 --> 01:39:48,123
Drink some water. Come on.

1152
01:39:52,193 --> 01:39:53,928
What is it?
Are you having
a panic attack right now?

1153
01:39:55,763 --> 01:39:58,366
You need to breathe.
You're not breathing properly.
Come here.

1154
01:40:01,602 --> 01:40:03,204
Hey, hey, it's all right.

1155
01:40:08,610 --> 01:40:12,480
Hey, hey, hey.
Hey. No, no, no.

1156
01:40:20,222 --> 01:40:21,523
I'm really sorry.

1157
01:40:26,762 --> 01:40:27,965
Okay, I'm really sorry.

1158
01:40:45,950 --> 01:40:48,086
<i>It is such a huge honor</i>

1159
01:40:48,186 --> 01:40:51,621
<i>to have been guided</i>
<i>by a woman like Romy Mathis.</i>

1160
01:40:52,323 --> 01:40:56,160
She understands the importance
of being a voice for your peers

1161
01:40:56,461 --> 01:40:58,297
and an advocate
for women around the world

1162
01:40:58,397 --> 01:41:02,867
who might not have
the same opportunities that us,
sitting here, have.

1163
01:41:03,135 --> 01:41:07,772
<i>So to be lifted up</i>
<i>by a hero like her</i>

1164
01:41:07,872 --> 01:41:10,575
<i>makes this experience</i>
<i>so much more exceptional.</i>

1165
01:41:12,643 --> 01:41:15,748
Who are we, as women?

1166
01:41:16,116 --> 01:41:19,185
<i>Modern leaders aren't afraid</i>
<i>to take chances</i>

1167
01:41:19,285 --> 01:41:22,956
<i>embrace change,</i>
<i>and usher a team</i>
<i>into the unknown.</i>

1168
01:41:23,223 --> 01:41:27,127
<i>Sincerity, vulnerability,</i>
<i>and radical self-honesty</i>

1169
01:41:27,227 --> 01:41:31,064
<i>will create a work environment</i>
<i>of shared learning, compassion,</i>

1170
01:41:31,164 --> 01:41:33,066
<i>and true connection.</i>

1171
01:41:33,166 --> 01:41:35,069
Now, how do we do that?

1172
01:41:35,336 --> 01:41:38,506
By making changes
from top to bottom
to support women

1173
01:41:38,605 --> 01:41:41,075
at every level
across the company.

1174
01:41:42,742 --> 01:41:44,844
<i>If we dare to let go</i>
<i>of expectations</i>

1175
01:41:44,944 --> 01:41:47,547
<i>and move towards what scares us,</i>

1176
01:41:47,647 --> 01:41:50,117
<i>we can often find</i>
<i>unexpected strengths.</i>

1177
01:41:50,583 --> 01:41:53,522
<i>Today, we celebrate</i>
<i>genuine authenticity</i>

1178
01:41:53,621 --> 01:41:57,691
<i>and true uniqueness</i>
<i>in every individual</i>
<i>that works at Tensile.</i>

1179
01:41:58,126 --> 01:42:02,264
<i>We invite each other</i>
<i>to show the world</i>
<i>who we really are</i>

1180
01:42:02,364 --> 01:42:06,201
<i>regardless of people's</i>
<i>assumptions and without fear.</i>

1181
01:42:27,991 --> 01:42:29,159
Hmm?

1182
01:42:31,128 --> 01:42:32,895
Oh, hey.

1183
01:42:34,597 --> 01:42:35,898
You okay?

1184
01:42:37,733 --> 01:42:39,635
You look like Grandma.

1185
01:42:43,874 --> 01:42:45,310
How did you get here?

1186
01:42:46,478 --> 01:42:47,811
I got a car.

1187
01:42:48,313 --> 01:42:49,347
You did?

1188
01:42:50,315 --> 01:42:51,949
That's expensive.

1189
01:42:53,650 --> 01:42:54,918
Mom...

1190
01:42:55,886 --> 01:42:57,788
...you have to come home.

1191
01:42:59,591 --> 01:43:01,059
Dad needs you.

1192
01:43:03,661 --> 01:43:06,198
He won't leave the theatre.

1193
01:43:06,698 --> 01:43:10,102
He won't eat,
and he's reading the Bible.

1194
01:43:11,936 --> 01:43:13,805
He'll forgive you, Mom.

1195
01:43:13,905 --> 01:43:15,374
What did he tell you?

1196
01:43:16,375 --> 01:43:17,376
Nothing.

1197
01:43:19,513 --> 01:43:21,248
Mary forgave me.

1198
01:43:28,687 --> 01:43:30,390
It's okay, Mom.

1199
01:43:33,393 --> 01:43:34,827
It's okay.

1200
01:43:38,599 --> 01:43:39,699
God.

1201
01:43:40,601 --> 01:43:41,969
Okay.

1202
01:43:49,243 --> 01:43:50,810
Please come home.

1203
01:44:16,206 --> 01:44:17,706
It's all my fault.

1204
01:44:19,275 --> 01:44:22,579
I told you that
I was someone else
and I got angry

1205
01:44:22,679 --> 01:44:25,148
because you didn't know
who I really was.

1206
01:44:25,448 --> 01:44:30,621
And I'm so sorry.
It's my problem.
It's my problem.

1207
01:44:31,188 --> 01:44:35,892
Hey. What a great way
to start the year, huh?

1208
01:44:38,429 --> 01:44:39,796
Um...

1209
01:44:41,798 --> 01:44:43,534
Whatever happened
to that intern?

1210
01:44:43,634 --> 01:44:46,437
The one who bought me
the coffee?

1211
01:44:46,803 --> 01:44:50,075
I heard he took
a job at Kawasaki?
In Tokyo?

1212
01:44:51,343 --> 01:44:52,344
Mm-hmm.

1213
01:44:53,744 --> 01:44:55,180
Good for him.

1214
01:44:55,280 --> 01:44:56,448
Good for you, too.

1215
01:44:58,949 --> 01:45:01,286
You didn't have anything
to do with that, did you?

1216
01:45:03,488 --> 01:45:05,924
Why don't you come over
next week for drinks?

1217
01:45:06,025 --> 01:45:08,227
I've got the house to myself.

1218
01:45:09,362 --> 01:45:10,829
We can talk about it.

1219
01:45:16,768 --> 01:45:18,770
Why don't you fuck off,
Sebastian?

1220
01:45:18,870 --> 01:45:21,107
Hey, careful, Romy.

1221
01:45:21,207 --> 01:45:25,145
I'm not afraid of you,
whatever the fuck
you're capable of.

1222
01:45:25,245 --> 01:45:28,515
Of what you know,
of what you don't know.
I don't give a shit.

1223
01:45:29,016 --> 01:45:32,818
Just don't ever talk to me
like that again.

1224
01:45:33,086 --> 01:45:36,922
If I want to be humiliated,
I'm gonna pay someone to do it.

1225
01:45:39,859 --> 01:45:42,063
Now get the fuck
out of my office.

1226
01:45:53,840 --> 01:45:55,076
<i>Five...</i>

1227
01:45:57,211 --> 01:45:58,147
<i>four...</i>

1228
01:46:00,349 --> 01:46:01,517
<i>three...</i>

1229
01:46:03,485 --> 01:46:04,553
<i>two...</i>

1230
01:46:06,655 --> 01:46:07,889
one...

1231
01:47:05,450 --> 01:47:06,551
Mm-hmm.
