347
00:16:49,633 --> 00:16:51,593
-[imperceptible]
-Guess who just

348
00:16:51,677 --> 00:16:52,928
spent the last half hour

349
00:16:53,012 --> 00:16:54,471
with the coolest guy in school.

350
00:16:54,555 --> 00:16:55,889
Oh, my God.

351
00:16:55,973 --> 00:16:57,683
-Really?
-[mouths]

352
00:16:57,766 --> 00:17:00,561
Mm-hmm. I helped him move
a city limits sign-- don't ask.

353
00:17:00,644 --> 00:17:03,439
And I gave him a ride home.
We hung out in his bedroom.

354
00:17:03,522 --> 00:17:05,566
-And now he's following me.
-[mouths] Bedroom!

355
00:17:05,649 --> 00:17:08,527
-That's so exciting.
-[Clara] Yeah.

356
00:17:08,610 --> 00:17:09,945
Should I follow him back?

357
00:17:10,029 --> 00:17:11,655
I mean, he told his girlfriend

358
00:17:11,739 --> 00:17:13,449
that "some dude"
gave him a ride home, so...

359
00:17:13,532 --> 00:17:15,367
clearly they've got
a messed-up thing going on.

360
00:17:15,451 --> 00:17:17,161
-Wait, he has a girlfriend?
-[Clara] Yeah.

361
00:17:17,244 --> 00:17:19,163
Yeah, she graduated last year.

362
00:17:19,246 --> 00:17:21,582
No, um, don't do that.

363
00:17:21,665 --> 00:17:24,334
You have to stay away,
Clare Bear. He's taken.

364
00:17:24,418 --> 00:17:25,919
Yeah, okay.

365
00:17:26,003 --> 00:17:28,005
Hey, listen,
don't tell my mom about this.

366
00:17:28,088 --> 00:17:29,506
You know how she gets.

367
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:31,550
Yeah. No, of course I won't.
Don't worry.

368
00:17:31,633 --> 00:17:34,053
-Okay, see you soon.
-[Clara] Bye.

369
00:17:36,805 --> 00:17:39,433
Sometimes it scares me
how good of a liar you are.

370
00:17:39,516 --> 00:17:43,187
-Well... boo!
-[Morgan chuckles]

371
00:17:43,270 --> 00:17:45,647
-You want some?
-[Morgan] Stop! No!

372
00:17:45,731 --> 00:17:47,441
[Chris] Lexie, can you hand me
some more of those chips?

373
00:17:47,524 --> 00:17:48,859
-[Lexie] Yes.
-[Chris] Thanks.

374
00:17:48,942 --> 00:17:50,402
-[chuckles]
-[baby exclaims]

375
00:17:50,486 --> 00:17:51,779
[Clara gasps]

376
00:17:51,862 --> 00:17:54,281
[Jonah] What is that?
What is that, dude?

377
00:17:54,364 --> 00:17:56,742
-[Jonah chuckles]
-Lexie, phone down.

378
00:17:56,825 --> 00:17:58,702
It's my Tinder date,
Mr. Grant.

379
00:17:58,786 --> 00:18:00,454
Don't you have to be 18
to be on that app?

380
00:18:00,537 --> 00:18:01,914
I am 18...

381
00:18:02,956 --> 00:18:04,374
on Tinder.

382
00:18:05,626 --> 00:18:06,960
So, back at it tomorrow, huh?

383
00:18:07,044 --> 00:18:10,047
-Excited?
-Mmm! Oh, yes. You have no idea.

384
00:18:10,130 --> 00:18:12,508
-What's tomorrow?
-She's coming back to work.

385
00:18:12,591 --> 00:18:15,094
Yeah, maternity leave
is officially over.

386
00:18:15,177 --> 00:18:17,513
I feel like I figured out
that I am not cut out

387
00:18:17,596 --> 00:18:18,972
to be a stay-at-home mom.

388
00:18:19,056 --> 00:18:20,474
That's what I've realized.
[chuckles]

389
00:18:20,557 --> 00:18:22,142
Thank you for watching Elijah.

390
00:18:22,226 --> 00:18:23,852
And don't worry,
he'll be in day care next week.

391
00:18:23,936 --> 00:18:26,688
Oh, my gosh, don't be silly.
I'm so excited.

392
00:18:26,772 --> 00:18:28,232
He's my favorite guy
to hang out with,

393
00:18:28,315 --> 00:18:30,025
-right?
-[Elijah coos]

394
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:32,361
I think he looks exactly like
Clara did when she was his age.

395
00:18:32,444 --> 00:18:34,571
Exactly. Don't you think?

396
00:18:34,655 --> 00:18:37,157
[gasps] Do you?
Are you a pretty boy?

397
00:18:37,241 --> 00:18:39,785
I think he looks
just like his gorgeous daddy.

398
00:18:39,868 --> 00:18:41,703
-Right?
-[Elijah coos]

399
00:18:41,787 --> 00:18:43,163
You want cake?

400
00:18:43,247 --> 00:18:45,207
Yep, sure. I'm down for cake.

401
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:46,416
I'll get it!

402
00:18:50,754 --> 00:18:53,590
Oh, my God! Miller Adams
is following you?

403
00:18:55,259 --> 00:18:57,136
I gave him a ride today.

404
00:18:57,219 --> 00:18:59,972
[Lexie] Oh, got it.
So you were in your car

405
00:19:00,055 --> 00:19:01,640
with him alone
and you didn't tell me.

406
00:19:01,723 --> 00:19:03,600
-Can we talk about it later?
-Okay, please.

407
00:19:03,684 --> 00:19:05,144
Why do I know that name?

408
00:19:05,227 --> 00:19:06,854
Miller Adams. Wait.

409
00:19:06,937 --> 00:19:08,480
Is that Hank's kid?

410
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:12,568
You remember Hank.

411
00:19:13,402 --> 00:19:15,154
-No.
-I remember Hank.

412
00:19:15,237 --> 00:19:17,156
There's still people
named Hank?

413
00:19:17,239 --> 00:19:18,740
He sold drugs
and went to prison.

414
00:19:18,824 --> 00:19:20,951
Someone we know
was Hank's best customer.

415
00:19:21,034 --> 00:19:24,454
Wait a minute. Hank's son
is the coolest guy in school?

416
00:19:24,538 --> 00:19:26,707
And it was just
the two of you today?

417
00:19:26,790 --> 00:19:29,251
Miller's a student of mine.
He's actually a really good kid.

418
00:19:29,334 --> 00:19:31,336
No offense, but you have him
for 45 minutes a day,

419
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:32,880
and he's on his best behavior.

420
00:19:32,963 --> 00:19:34,548
You don't really know
what kind of kid he is.

421
00:19:34,631 --> 00:19:37,217
We're not dating anyone
whose father's a felon.

422
00:19:37,301 --> 00:19:39,219
My God, I just gave him a ride.

423
00:19:39,303 --> 00:19:41,471
Okay, relax.
Nobody's dating anybody.

424
00:19:41,555 --> 00:19:44,600
Clara is staying away because
the boy has a girlfriend.

425
00:19:45,809 --> 00:19:47,019
I don't know.
My mom always said

426
00:19:47,102 --> 00:19:48,687
that just because
there's a goalie

427
00:19:48,770 --> 00:19:50,063
doesn't mean
you can't score.

428
00:19:51,064 --> 00:19:53,483
-What?
-Your mom always says that?

429
00:19:53,567 --> 00:19:56,028
-Yeah.
-[both giggle]

430
00:19:58,739 --> 00:20:00,991
Oh. Thank you. You can just
put those right there.

431
00:20:01,074 --> 00:20:02,201
Okay.

432
00:20:09,333 --> 00:20:10,459
What?

433
00:20:11,585 --> 00:20:13,170
Oh, my God, just say it!

434
00:20:13,253 --> 00:20:14,838
You can't look at me like that
and not say anything.

435
00:20:14,922 --> 00:20:16,506
My being here bothers you.

436
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:17,841
Jonah.

437
00:20:17,925 --> 00:20:20,552
Just, I want things
to be okay with us.

438
00:20:20,636 --> 00:20:24,139
[sighs] Okay, should we do this?
Should we just do this now?

439
00:20:24,223 --> 00:20:26,099
Yes! Tell me. Just say it.

440
00:20:26,183 --> 00:20:27,726
Okay.

441
00:20:27,809 --> 00:20:31,021
You graduated and you dumped
Jenny and you disappeared.

442
00:20:31,104 --> 00:20:33,523
You just left. You didn't
give us any explanation.

443
00:20:33,607 --> 00:20:34,900
Where you were going,

444
00:20:34,983 --> 00:20:36,401
when we would hear
from you next, nothing.

445
00:20:36,485 --> 00:20:38,487
Do you have any idea
how many times I called you?

446
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:40,280
You didn't respond once!

447
00:20:40,364 --> 00:20:42,115
-I thought we were friends.
-We are.

448
00:20:42,199 --> 00:20:45,452
No, no, no. You get my sister
pregnant, move back to town,

449
00:20:45,535 --> 00:20:47,204
and I'm supposed to be,
like, fine with it,

450
00:20:47,287 --> 00:20:49,539
but it's taking me a minute.
Okay?

451
00:20:49,623 --> 00:20:52,960
That's fair. And I'm sorry.

452
00:20:53,043 --> 00:20:55,629
But Jenny's so happy,

453
00:20:55,712 --> 00:20:57,631
and you've really
stepped up as a dad.

454
00:20:58,674 --> 00:21:00,259
And I guess
that's all that matters.

455
00:21:09,768 --> 00:21:11,103
Hey, before I forget.

456
00:21:12,145 --> 00:21:13,480
Happy birthday.

457
00:21:16,650 --> 00:21:18,485
Can't stay mad at me
forever.

458
00:21:22,781 --> 00:21:24,283
-Bye, guys.
-Happy birthday.

459
00:21:24,366 --> 00:21:26,410
Bye, Jenny, Jonah.
You're wobbly.

460
00:21:26,493 --> 00:21:28,412
-[Chris] Do not let her drive.
-Absolutely not. I got her.

461
00:21:28,495 --> 00:21:30,372
I'm just unlocking the car.
I'll see you in the morning!

462
00:21:30,455 --> 00:21:32,791
-[Jonah] I got it. Thank you. Happy birthday.
-[sighs]

463
00:21:32,874 --> 00:21:35,544
[singing]
♪ Happy birthday to you ♪

464
00:21:35,627 --> 00:21:38,380
♪ Happy birthday to you ♪

465
00:21:38,463 --> 00:21:41,049
Aww, I think I might have
sabotaged my own birthday.

466
00:21:41,133 --> 00:21:42,467
What? Why?

467
00:21:42,551 --> 00:21:44,219
I feel like the Hank thing
just threw me off

468
00:21:44,303 --> 00:21:46,722
and I think we might've been
too hard on her. Were we?

469
00:21:46,805 --> 00:21:49,391
No! No. We have
to nip that in the bud.

470
00:21:49,474 --> 00:21:51,310
-Okay. Yes.
-Okay?

471
00:21:51,393 --> 00:21:53,854
-Happy birthday.
-Aww...

472
00:21:53,937 --> 00:21:56,315
-Thank you.
-I'll do the dishes, okay?

473
00:21:57,858 --> 00:21:59,276
I already did them.

474
00:21:59,943 --> 00:22:00,944
[sighs]

475
00:22:01,028 --> 00:22:02,696
-Mom.
-Yeah?

476
00:22:02,779 --> 00:22:03,989
It's that time.

477
00:22:04,072 --> 00:22:06,491
-Oh, my gosh. Of course it is.
-Mm-hmm.

478
00:22:09,494 --> 00:22:11,288
And there we go. Yay me!

479
00:22:11,371 --> 00:22:14,624
-Big one. Congratulations.
-Thank you very much.

480
00:22:14,708 --> 00:22:16,793
[chuckles]
Watermelon's the best.

481
00:22:16,877 --> 00:22:19,296
Yes, it's the only flavor
worth the cavities.

482
00:22:19,379 --> 00:22:21,173
I'm proud of how many of these
I've checked off.

483
00:22:21,256 --> 00:22:22,382
I know.

484
00:22:22,466 --> 00:22:25,135
"Get a phone.
Any phone is good."

485
00:22:25,218 --> 00:22:26,887
[laughs]

486
00:22:26,970 --> 00:22:28,638
I regret that one.

487
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:33,143
-But you don't like that one.
-I didn't say anything.

488
00:22:34,227 --> 00:22:36,772
-Mmm, you didn't have to.
-It's just...

489
00:22:36,855 --> 00:22:38,357
the world is so hard.

490
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:40,025
That world is even harder.

491
00:22:40,108 --> 00:22:41,401
The odds are
stacked against you.

492
00:22:41,485 --> 00:22:42,694
I think it's smart
if you just--

493
00:22:42,778 --> 00:22:44,196
Yeah, get a degree
in something more...

494
00:22:44,738 --> 00:22:46,114
realistic.

495
00:22:46,198 --> 00:22:48,450
Just as a backup.

496
00:22:48,533 --> 00:22:50,035
But whenever
you were my age,

497
00:22:50,118 --> 00:22:51,870
didn't you have anything
that you were, like...

498
00:22:51,953 --> 00:22:53,538
actually passionate about?

499
00:22:53,622 --> 00:22:56,666
I went from raising Aunt Jenny
to being pregnant with you

500
00:22:56,750 --> 00:22:58,210
and then raising you and...

501
00:22:58,293 --> 00:23:01,797
I never had time in there
for my passions.

502
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:04,925
Well, that's... sad.

503
00:23:05,008 --> 00:23:06,051
I don't know.

504
00:23:06,134 --> 00:23:07,511
I think...

505
00:23:08,595 --> 00:23:10,138
that your goal this year
should be...

506
00:23:10,222 --> 00:23:11,598
Okay.

507
00:23:12,224 --> 00:23:14,309
"Find your...

508
00:23:15,268 --> 00:23:17,270
-passion!"
-Mm-hmm.

509
00:23:17,354 --> 00:23:19,064
[Morgan] Okay,
I have a question for you.

510
00:23:19,147 --> 00:23:20,607
Mm-hmm...

511
00:23:20,690 --> 00:23:24,069
When you think of me,
what one word comes to mind?

512
00:23:24,152 --> 00:23:25,987
Not something
like "mom" or "wife,"

513
00:23:26,071 --> 00:23:27,697
but something descriptive.

514
00:23:27,781 --> 00:23:29,699
Right now? "Overprotective."

515
00:23:29,783 --> 00:23:31,868
Overprotective?

516

Didn't know this movie
was a tearjerker.

878
00:46:18,150 --> 00:46:20,152
Yeah, uh...

879
00:46:20,235 --> 00:46:22,237
my dad loved movies.

880
00:46:23,614 --> 00:46:25,783
We used to come here a lot.

881
00:46:26,742 --> 00:46:28,285
That's why I was crying.

882
00:46:28,994 --> 00:46:30,704
You know, um...

883
00:46:30,788 --> 00:46:33,207
Refuge Coffee plays, like,
old horror movies once a month.

884
00:46:33,290 --> 00:46:35,542
So, you know, if you want to...

885
00:46:38,879 --> 00:46:40,547
I should probably get going.

886
00:46:43,884 --> 00:46:45,886
I'm sorry,
did I say something wrong?

887
00:46:45,969 --> 00:46:48,180
No, um, just...

888
00:46:48,263 --> 00:46:50,474
smiling feels wrong right now.
[sniffles]

889
00:46:50,557 --> 00:46:52,643
But I'll see you at school.

890
00:46:52,726 --> 00:46:53,852
Yeah.

891
00:46:58,273 --> 00:46:59,608
Thank you.

892
00:47:02,569 --> 00:47:03,904
How are you so calm?

893
00:47:04,780 --> 00:47:07,199
Trust me, I'm not, but...

894
00:47:08,659 --> 00:47:11,328

they cut you deeper than me.

Clara can never know.

896
00:47:16,625 --> 00:47:20,420
She's been through enough already.
Just promise me.

897
00:47:21,547 --> 00:47:23,632
She worshipped them.

898
00:47:24,633 --> 00:47:27,761
It would absolutely
destroy her.

00:48:28,906 --> 00:48:31,700

did you not understand?

908
00:48:31,783 --> 00:48:35,495

I don't want to talk about this.

Who would do that?
Did you call the cops?

-It's trashed!
-You are grounded!

914
00:48:45,005 --> 00:48:46,924
Just go to your room!
Be in your room!

915
00:48:47,007 --> 00:48:48,634

from the kitchen now?

cheering me up tonight.

It's the middle of the night.

I can't do this.

-He's fine, I'm not.

-What?

Hi, bubba.

930
00:49:59,746 --> 00:50:01,039
Do you mind
taking him for a second?

931
00:50:01,123 --> 00:50:02,541
-I'm just gonna talk to Jonah.
-Yeah.

-And here, take this. Jonah!

is going on with you?

-What? What happened?

935
00:50:14,344 --> 00:50:16,596
He has Chris's fucking smile.

Um, Jonah's
just not feeling well.

940
00:50:24,938 --> 00:50:26,940
But do you mind feeding Elijah?
I think he's hungry.

941
00:50:27,024 --> 00:50:29,067
Check if there's
a bottle in the bag.

942
00:50:29,151 --> 00:50:30,277
Sure.

943
00:50:30,360 --> 00:50:31,653
Thank you.

00:50:31,737 --> 00:50:33,530
So what is your plan?

00:50:33,613 --> 00:50:35,365
I don't know.
I need to clear my head.

00:50:35,449 --> 00:50:37,117
Oh, okay. Uh, when
will you be back?

I don't know.

948
00:50:39,327 --> 00:50:42,581
Okay, I see.
So you're leaving again.

949
00:50:42,664 --> 00:50:44,499
You're just gonna
dump your son on me

950
00:50:44,583 --> 00:50:47,711
and then you're just gonna
come back who knows when?

No, but he's going to. Soon.

1022

never gonna get back.

01:04:51,262 --> 01:04:53,931
-[Morgan] Mmm...
-No, it's fine. Yeah. Okay.

1218
01:04:57,351 --> 01:05:01,022
I swear, I have no idea what's
going on with my mom lately.

1219
01:05:04,358 --> 01:05:06,485
Yeah, give her time.
She's dealing with a lot.

1220
01:05:11,198 --> 01:05:13,117
[Lexie] Whoa, hey!

1221
01:05:13,200 --> 01:05:15,411
Find a boyfriend for me yet?

1222
01:05:15,494 --> 01:05:17,788
Actually, yeah. Um...

1223
01:05:17,872 --> 01:05:19,957
-You know Efren?
-[Lexie] The AV nerd?

1224
01:05:20,041 --> 01:05:21,334
Yo, Efren!

1225
01:05:21,417 --> 01:05:22,919
[Efren] Ow! Oh...

1226
01:05:23,002 --> 01:05:24,420
Hey, hey, hey.

1227
01:05:24,503 --> 01:05:25,796
Oh...

1228
01:05:25,880 --> 01:05:27,965
-Uh, come here, man.
-[grunts]

1229
01:05:28,049 --> 01:05:29,759
[softly] Okay, hey.

1230
01:05:31,010 --> 01:05:32,345
He's really nice.

1231
01:05:32,428 --> 01:05:33,804
[Lexie] Don't tell him
to come over here.

1232
01:05:33,888 --> 01:05:35,723
No, you'll love him.
What's up, dude?

1233
01:05:35,806 --> 01:05:37,099
[sighs]

1234
01:05:37,183 --> 01:05:38,476
-Hi, Efren.
-[Efren] Hi, Clara.

1235
01:05:38,559 --> 01:05:40,144
-What's up, dude?
-What's up?

1236
01:05:40,937 --> 01:05:42,605
Do you know Lexie?

1237
01:05:42,688 --> 01:05:44,148
Uh, not really.

1238
01:05:44,231 --> 01:05:46,943
No. No offense, though!
It's just that, um...

1239
01:05:47,944 --> 01:05:49,862
you always seemed
kind of scary.

1240
01:05:49,946 --> 01:05:51,322
I am scary.

1241
01:05:51,405 --> 01:05:53,157
Yeah, uh... [clears throat]

1242
01:05:53,240 --> 01:05:54,742
Do you have any tattoos?

1243
01:05:54,825 --> 01:05:57,036
[scoffing]
Hell, no! No! What?

1244
01:05:58,996 --> 01:06:00,790
Wait, why? Should I?

1245
01:06:00,873 --> 01:06:04,377
Don't you have to be, like, 18?
[mumbles, chuckles awkwardly]

1246
01:06:04,460 --> 01:06:06,963
I don't want
to do that, so, uh...

1247
01:06:10,925 --> 01:06:12,760
[knocking on door]

1248
01:06:16,639 --> 01:06:18,015
-Hey.
-Something's wrong.

1249
01:06:18,099 --> 01:06:19,392
-He feels really hot...
-[Elijah fussing]

1250
01:06:19,475 --> 01:06:20,977
...and he's not acting
like himself.

1251
01:06:21,060 --> 01:06:23,813
Okay, let's see. Oh, bubba.

1252
01:06:23,896 --> 01:06:26,232
Oh, yeah, looks like
he's got a little bug.

1253
01:06:26,315 --> 01:06:27,608
Feel the back of his neck.

1254
01:06:27,692 --> 01:06:29,527
-Yeah. Buddy.
-Yeah.

1255
01:06:29,610 --> 01:06:31,612
Oh, we're gonna take
care of you. Come here.

1256
01:06:31,696 --> 01:06:32,822
Okay.

1257
01:06:34,740 --> 01:06:37,702
Uh, acetaminophen
always helps.

1258
01:06:37,785 --> 01:06:39,954
It does.
But firsts are the worst.

1259
01:06:40,037 --> 01:06:42,456
-First fall. First fever.
-[Elijah fussing]

1260
01:06:42,540 --> 01:06:43,833
First tooth.

1261
01:06:43,916 --> 01:06:45,793
Oh. This is a cold.

1262
01:06:45,876 --> 01:06:47,503
God, how am I gonna
do this, buddy?

1263
01:06:47,586 --> 01:06:49,046
Oh, you just will.

1264
01:06:50,131 --> 01:06:51,882
Hey. Is Elijah all right?

1265
01:06:51,966 --> 01:06:53,718
Yeah, it's just a cold.

1266
01:06:53,801 --> 01:06:55,761
Yeah, I'm still new at this.
Your mom's helping me out.

1267
01:06:55,845 --> 01:06:56,846
Where are you going?

1268
01:06:56,929 --> 01:06:59,306
Um, to the movies with Lexie.

1269
01:06:59,390 --> 01:07:02,727
Oh, weird. I didn't realize Miller
had changed his name to Lexie.

1270
01:07:04,103 --> 01:07:05,563
Doesn't he have
a girlfriend?

1271
01:07:05,646 --> 01:07:07,690
-They broke up.
-Oh, okay.

1272
01:07:07,773 --> 01:07:09,692
And 30 seconds later,
he's with you.

1273
01:07:09,775 --> 01:07:11,986
-Mom.
-I'm just saying.

1274
01:07:12,069 --> 01:07:15,448
He's not the kind of guy that's worth
throwing your life away for, Clara.

1275
01:07:15,531 --> 01:07:17,908
[scoffing]
Throwing my life away?

1276
01:07:17,992 --> 01:07:20,286
Jesus, Mom,
I'm going to the movies.

1277
01:07:21,620 --> 01:07:23,581
[sighs]

1278
01:07:23,664 --> 01:07:26,542
Don't look at me.
I'm Team Miller. [chuckles]

1279
01:07:26,625 --> 01:07:27,752
Sorry.

1280
01:07:27,835 --> 01:07:29,378
I am putting you
to work for that.

1281
01:07:29,462 --> 01:07:30,463
-That's fair.
-Right?

1282
01:07:30,546 --> 01:07:32,048
Should we put Dada to work?

1283
01:07:32,965 --> 01:07:34,550
[Jonah] Ugh! Got it.

1284
01:07:35,843 --> 01:07:38,304
So, I think we can
just take this entire thing

1285
01:07:38,387 --> 01:07:39,555
down in one piece.

1286
01:07:39,638 --> 01:07:40,806
I just have to empty it.

1287
01:07:40,890 --> 01:07:43,309
-[chair sliding]
-I'm so excited!

1288
01:07:53,944 --> 01:07:55,279
[sighs]

1289
01:07:55,362 --> 01:07:56,489
Morgan.

1290
01:08:04,872 --> 01:08:06,290
This is Jenny's handwriting.

1291
01:08:07,291 --> 01:08:09,794
Right under our noses?

1292
01:08:15,633 --> 01:08:18,052
I don't need to read them.

1293
01:08:18,135 --> 01:08:21,013
Oh, come on. You're not even
a little bit curious?

1294
01:08:21,097 --> 01:08:22,473
It's in the past.

1295
01:08:22,556 --> 01:08:24,517
Huh... Must be nice.

1296
01:08:27,561 --> 01:08:31,315
You are not the one
living in his house.

1297
01:08:31,398 --> 01:08:33,234
Living in his parents' house.

1298
01:08:33,317 --> 01:08:34,610
Surrounded by his things.

1299
01:08:34,693 --> 01:08:37,321
His stuff is everywhere!
It is everywhere!

1300
01:08:37,404 --> 01:08:39,490
That painting!
That horrible painting.

1301
01:08:39,573 --> 01:08:41,617
Jenny took me
to a specific place

1302
01:08:41,700 --> 01:08:43,202
to buy that painting
for Chris's birthday,

1303
01:08:43,285 --> 01:08:46,455
and I was, like, "Chris?
A painting for his birthday?

1304
01:08:46,539 --> 01:08:48,082
Why are we doing this?"

1305
01:08:48,165 --> 01:08:50,084
And she was, like,
"You don't know him like I do."

1306
01:08:50,167 --> 01:08:52,461
I thought she was kidding.

1307
01:08:52,545 --> 01:08:54,171
She wasn't kidding.

1308
01:08:55,214 --> 01:08:57,508
All right. I have an idea.

1309
01:08:58,968 --> 01:09:00,469
Oh, my God,
I hate this thing.

1310
01:09:00,553 --> 01:09:01,887
-I'm so excited. I'm doing this.
-Go. Go. Go!

1311
01:09:01,971 --> 01:09:03,222
-It's gonna be messy.
-Yes.

1312
01:09:03,305 --> 01:09:04,598
But it's fine.
We don't care.

1313
01:09:04,682 --> 01:09:06,058
-Look at how ugly that thing is.
-Ugh! Okay.

1314
01:09:06,142 --> 01:09:07,184
[groans]

1315
01:09:07,268 --> 01:09:08,644
Ugh! This painting!

1316
01:09:09,895 --> 01:09:12,231
-Give it a little crow hop!
-Oh, my God! [exclaims]

1317
01:09:12,314 --> 01:09:14,692
[grunting]

1318
01:09:16,527 --> 01:09:18,028
Don't drag it.
Oh, there we go.

1319
01:09:18,112 --> 01:09:19,071
[Jonah grunts]

1320
01:09:19,155 --> 01:09:20,322
Okay.

1321
01:09:20,406 --> 01:09:21,615
[chuckles]
Where are we going?

1322
01:09:21,699 --> 01:09:23,325
-Patience, Grasshopper.
-Okay.

1323
01:09:23,409 --> 01:09:25,244
-Okay.
-Oh...

1324
01:09:26,662 --> 01:09:28,122
What is all this?

1325
01:09:28,205 --> 01:09:29,748
I'm wooing you with
my popcorn-making skills.

1326
01:09:29,832 --> 01:09:31,584
Really? [chuckles]

1327
01:09:31,667 --> 01:09:32,918
Oh...

1328
01:09:33,002 --> 01:09:35,713
Perfect combination
of butter and salt.

1329
01:09:38,048 --> 01:09:40,092
-Hmm... Mm-hmm.
-Uh-huh. Yup.

1330
01:09:40,968 --> 01:09:42,178
Where is everyone?

1331
01:09:42,261 --> 01:09:43,512
Oh, they're
cleaning the floors.

1332
01:09:43,596 --> 01:09:45,347
But it takes
48 hours for it to dry,

1333
01:09:45,431 --> 01:09:47,224
so we have the theater
to ourselves.

1334
01:09:47,308 --> 01:09:49,101
What are we watching?

1335
01:09:49,185 --> 01:09:50,561
It's a surprise.

1336
01:09:50,644 --> 01:09:52,021
Oh.

1337
01:09:52,104 --> 01:09:53,689
-[chuckles]
-My bad. [chuckles]

1338
01:09:53,772 --> 01:09:55,816
-You ready, Efren?
-[Efren] It's coming right up!

1339
01:09:55,900 --> 01:09:57,276
-Hi, Clara.
-Hi, Efren.

1340
01:09:57,359 --> 01:09:58,694
Thank you.

1341
01:09:58,777 --> 01:10:00,946
[mellow music playing
over theater speakers]

1342
01:10:02,323 --> 01:10:06,285
I cannot get over
how much of a mess this is.

1343
01:10:06,368 --> 01:10:07,870
-[chuckles]
-It's insane.

1344
01:10:07,953 --> 01:10:09,455
I just realized I got some
on the ceiling. [chuckles]

1345
01:10:09,538 --> 01:10:10,873
[Morgan laughing]
It's everywhere.

1346
01:10:10,956 --> 01:10:12,416
Oh, wait, wait. Look at me.

1347
01:10:12,499 --> 01:10:14,251
I got you.

1348
01:10:14,335 --> 01:10:17,379
-What is it? Oh, my God.
-What do you think it is?

1349
01:10:18,547 --> 01:10:20,382
[both laughing]

1350
01:10:20,466 --> 01:10:21,842
How?

1351
01:10:21,926 --> 01:10:23,344
[continues laughing]
That's insane!

1352
01:10:23,427 --> 01:10:24,762
It's nice hearing you laugh.

1353
01:10:24,845 --> 01:10:27,014
You, too, Mr. Serious.

1354
01:10:27,097 --> 01:10:29,683
-What?
-Oh, come on. Jonah.

1355
01:10:29,767 --> 01:10:32,436
In school,
you were always so serious.

1356
01:10:32,519 --> 01:10:34,688
You were also mysterious.

1357
01:10:34,772 --> 01:10:37,191
With the glasses?
I mean, come on.

1358
01:10:37,274 --> 01:10:40,986
But I kind of made it a point
to notice everything about you.

1359
01:10:41,070 --> 01:10:42,696
Like what?

1360
01:10:42,780 --> 01:10:45,783
Um, I don't know,
like your insane hatred

1361
01:10:45,866 --> 01:10:48,160
for watermelon Jolly Ranchers.

1362
01:10:48,786 --> 01:10:49,870
Weirdo.

1363
01:10:49,954 --> 01:10:51,997
They're the best.

1364
01:10:52,081 --> 01:10:55,501
I didn't hate them.
I actually love them.

1365
01:10:56,377 --> 01:10:58,254
I just saved them for you

1366
01:10:58,337 --> 01:11:00,756
because I know
they're your favorite.

1367
01:11:04,343 --> 01:11:06,470
[Elijah cooing]

1368
01:11:08,639 --> 01:11:10,599
Gonna check on Elijah.

1369
01:11:10,683 --> 01:11:11,892
Morgan.

1370
01:11:12,643 --> 01:11:14,019
Jonah.

1371
01:11:16,105 --> 01:11:18,023
We're both going through
a lot right now...

1372
01:11:18,107 --> 01:11:19,692
No, don't do that.

1373
01:11:19,775 --> 01:11:21,819
And we're feeling very
vulnerable and we are angry.

1374
01:11:21,902 --> 01:11:24,655
That's not what this is.
I've wanted you since the day I met you.

1375
01:11:24,738 --> 01:11:26,865
[sighs]

1376
01:11:26,949 --> 01:11:29,326
My biggest regret is
not telling you how I felt

1377
01:11:29,410 --> 01:11:30,953
before Chris swooped in.

1378
01:11:31,036 --> 01:11:33,789
I should have fought
harder for you.

1379
01:11:33,872 --> 01:11:35,791
And I think
you felt the same.

1380
01:11:41,005 --> 01:11:42,298
Yeah, but...

1381
01:11:42,381 --> 01:11:43,882
it doesn't matter.

1382
01:11:43,966 --> 01:11:45,384
[choked up] It doesn't matter
what I felt then,

1383
01:11:45,467 --> 01:11:46,677
it doesn't matter
what I feel now.

1384
01:11:46,760 --> 01:11:48,679
This is my life now.

1385
01:11:48,762 --> 01:11:50,514
Clara's my world, that's it.

1386
01:11:50,597 --> 01:11:54,643
-This isn't about Clara.

-No, talk to me. What is it?
-I...

1562
01:22:59,975 --> 01:23:02,102
I'm sorry.

1563
01:23:02,185 --> 01:23:03,770
[groans] It's just...

1564
01:23:03,853 --> 01:23:05,105
God, my...

1565
01:23:05,689 --> 01:23:07,148
mom and Jonah...

1566
01:23:08,900 --> 01:23:11,569
I just saw them kissing.

1567
01:23:11,653 --> 01:23:14,072
And my dad
and Aunt Jenny are dead,

1568
01:23:14,155 --> 01:23:16,491
and they're making out?

1569
01:23:16,574 --> 01:23:18,326
I just don't know how long

1570
01:23:18,410 --> 01:23:21,162
it's been going on
or what's happening, and I'm...

1571
01:23:21,246 --> 01:23:26,042
really confused
and I'm just so angry.

1572
01:23:26,835 --> 01:23:28,670
I'm just really angry.

1573
01:23:28,753 --> 01:23:30,296
And that's why
you called me over here?

1574
01:23:30,380 --> 01:23:32,590
[breathing heavily]

1575
01:23:32,674 --> 01:23:35,468
-Because you're mad at your mom?
-Miller, no, I--

1576
01:23:36,302 --> 01:23:37,637
No, I-- Wait.

1577
01:23:38,722 --> 01:23:40,807
Where are you going?

1578
01:23:41,683 --> 01:23:43,184
You weren't ready.

1579
01:23:43,268 --> 01:23:46,146
We said prom, and you
want to get back at them.

1580
01:23:47,439 --> 01:23:49,107
I promise, it...

1581
01:23:49,190 --> 01:23:51,985
I'm sorry. It wasn't personal.

1582
01:23:52,068 --> 01:23:53,528
Exactly.

1583
01:23:53,611 --> 01:23:54,904
The one thing that should've
been most personal

1584
01:23:54,988 --> 01:23:56,239
wasn't personal at all.

1585
01:23:56,322 --> 01:23:58,324
Look, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, okay?

1586
01:23:58,408 --> 01:24:01,745
I... Please, just stay.
[sobbing]

1587
01:24:06,791 --> 01:24:08,877
I'll stay
till you fall asleep.

1588
01:24:23,725 --> 01:24:25,185
I'm sorry.

1589
01:24:32,817 --> 01:24:35,528
[birds chirping]

1590
01:24:42,202 --> 01:24:43,620
[Morgan] Clara.

1591
01:24:55,173 --> 01:24:56,925
-[gasps]
-[both exclaim]

1592
01:24:57,008 --> 01:24:58,468
Oh, my God!
What the hell, Clara?

1593
01:24:58,551 --> 01:25:00,053
-[Clara] Mom...
-[Morgan] What is happening?

1594
01:25:00,136 --> 01:25:01,679
-You need to leave right now!
-Yeah.

1595
01:25:01,763 --> 01:25:05,058
Out the door like a person!
What the hell?

1596
01:25:05,141 --> 01:25:06,434
Yeah, um...

1597
01:25:06,518 --> 01:25:08,269
-Clara, I'll see you at school.
-Okay.

1598
01:25:08,353 --> 01:25:10,855
No, he won't see you at school.

1599
01:25:10,939 --> 01:25:13,191
Yes, he will.
What, are you grounding me from school now?

1600
01:25:13,274 --> 01:25:14,943
Uh, yeah, I'm grounding you
from school.

1601
01:25:15,026 --> 01:25:16,569
You're 16 years old,
I can ground you

1602
01:25:16,653 --> 01:25:17,987
from wherever
I want to ground you from!

1603
01:25:18,071 --> 01:25:20,198
Actually, Mother, I'm 17.

1604
01:25:20,281 --> 01:25:22,408
But I guess you were too busy with
Jonah to remember that it's my birthday.

1605
01:25:22,492 --> 01:25:24,035
Oh, no, I remembered.
How could I forget that?

1606
01:25:24,119 --> 01:25:25,870
And we are having your
birthday dinner here tonight.

1607
01:25:25,954 --> 01:25:27,372
I don't want it.

1608
01:25:27,455 --> 01:25:30,250
You will be here whether
you hate my guts or not!

1609
01:25:32,127 --> 01:25:34,254
[clamoring]

1610
01:25:36,923 --> 01:25:38,133
[Clara] Hey.

1611
01:25:38,216 --> 01:25:39,467
[cell phone dings]

1612
01:25:39,551 --> 01:25:41,010
[Miller] Hey. You okay?

1613
01:25:42,846 --> 01:25:45,390
[Clara] I don't know.
Are we okay?

1614
01:25:46,683 --> 01:25:47,892
-[dings]
-[Miller] Don't worry.

1615
01:25:47,976 --> 01:25:50,311
It's your birthday.

1616
01:25:50,395 --> 01:25:52,939
-[clacks]
-[exclaims] Oh, my God! Jerk.

1617
01:25:53,022 --> 01:25:55,150
Still not aware
of your surroundings?

1618
01:26:00,155 --> 01:26:01,781
-Stop.
-[chuckles]

1619
01:26:01,865 --> 01:26:04,242
[chuckles]
When did you have time?

1620
01:26:04,325 --> 01:26:06,077
Uh, right before school.
I, um...

1621
01:26:06,161 --> 01:26:09,038
I didn't really know
what you wanted, so I, uh...

1622
01:26:10,582 --> 01:26:12,041
Ta-da!

1623
01:26:12,125 --> 01:26:13,751
It's perfect.

1624
01:26:15,336 --> 01:26:16,462
I love it.

1625
01:26:18,173 --> 01:26:19,424
Um...

1626
01:26:19,507 --> 01:26:21,301
Birthday dinner.
Tonight at my place.

1627
01:26:21,384 --> 01:26:23,136
That sounds
like a terrible idea.

1628
01:26:23,219 --> 01:26:26,222
It's my birthday.
I can invite whoever I want.

1629
01:26:27,849 --> 01:26:29,017
Please?

1630
01:26:34,814 --> 01:26:36,191
-Um...
-Hey, Miller.

1631
01:26:36,274 --> 01:26:38,109
Can you give us a minute?

1632
01:26:38,193 --> 01:26:39,569
Yeah, um...

1633
01:26:39,652 --> 01:26:42,197
I'll see you tonight,
Clara.

1634
01:26:43,615 --> 01:26:45,950
I have nothing to say to you.

1635
01:26:47,202 --> 01:26:49,370
It's like neither of you
ever cared about them.

1636
01:26:49,454 --> 01:26:50,788
Clara, it's complicated.

1637
01:26:50,872 --> 01:26:52,832
Let me guess.
I wouldn't understand?

1638
01:26:52,916 --> 01:26:54,709
No, it's just...

1639
01:26:54,792 --> 01:26:56,628
[sighs] It's not my place.

1640
01:26:56,711 --> 01:26:58,296
That's for you
and your mom to discuss.

1641
01:26:58,379 --> 01:27:00,632
Yeah, well, I never want
to talk to her again.

1642
01:27:00,715 --> 01:27:02,300
Look, I know you're pissed.

1643
01:27:02,383 --> 01:27:03,968
But the last thing she'd
ever want is to hurt you.

1644
01:27:04,052 --> 01:27:05,678
-You know that.
-I'm gonna be late for class.

1645
01:27:05,762 --> 01:27:07,472
Well, it's my class,
and we're both late!

1646
01:27:07,555 --> 01:27:09,933
-[school bell rings]
-Clara.

1647
01:27:12,518 --> 01:27:13,645
[car beeps]

1648
01:27:16,022 --> 01:27:18,524
-[door opens]
-[sighs]

1649
01:27:21,569 --> 01:27:23,363
Hi. I don't know if we've
been properly introduced.

1650
01:27:23,446 --> 01:27:25,240
Oh. Sure we have.
You're Miller Adams.

1651
01:27:25,323 --> 01:27:26,699
You're the boy
that kidnapped my daughter

1652
01:27:26,783 --> 01:27:28,910
from her father's funeral
to get her high

1653
01:27:28,993 --> 01:27:32,497
and then you climbed into her bedroom
window last night to have sex with her.

1654
01:27:33,289 --> 01:27:34,916
Was that not you?

1655
01:27:36,167 --> 01:27:37,335
That was you.

1656
01:27:39,545 --> 01:27:41,881
Yeah, I think I'm just gonna--

1657
01:27:41,965 --> 01:27:45,385
It's my birthday.
I can invite whoever I want.

1658
01:27:51,099 --> 01:27:52,350
[Clara scoffs]

1659
01:27:53,518 --> 01:27:55,186
I can see
you've done the same.

1660
01:27:55,270 --> 01:27:57,647
[Jonah] Oh, no, I just
came to drop this off.

1661
01:27:57,730 --> 01:27:59,983
-I won't stay.
-[Clara] No!

1662
01:28:00,608 --> 01:28:03,361
Stay. Join us.

1663
01:28:04,070 --> 01:28:06,155
Yeah. Stay.

1664
01:28:07,573 --> 01:28:10,285
This'll be fun! [chuckles]

1665
01:28:11,286 --> 01:28:13,454
[fork and china
clinking loudly]

1666
01:28:13,538 --> 01:28:14,998
[Morgan clears throat]

1667
01:28:16,791 --> 01:28:18,293
No.

1668
01:28:18,376 --> 01:28:21,254
[fork and china
continue clinking]

1669
01:28:24,757 --> 01:28:27,093
Awkward!
[chuckles nervously]

1670
01:28:29,220 --> 01:28:31,723
This is really good,
Mrs. Grant. Thank you.

1671
01:28:32,557 --> 01:28:34,183
Thank you, Miller.

1672
01:28:34,267 --> 01:28:36,602
And thank you, Mr. Sullivan,
for the recommendation letter.

1673
01:28:36,686 --> 01:28:38,021
It means... It means a lot.

1674
01:28:38,104 --> 01:28:40,565
Of course. Yeah.
You finish your short film?

1675
01:28:40,648 --> 01:28:43,568
-No, we've been too busy having sex.
-[spits]

1676
01:28:49,157 --> 01:28:50,825
It's a joke.

1677
01:28:50,908 --> 01:28:52,785
Party! Lighten up, people.

1678
01:28:52,869 --> 01:28:55,413
[fork and china
continue clinking]

1679
01:28:56,664 --> 01:28:59,167
Oh, I really like
the changes that you've made

1680
01:28:59,250 --> 01:29:00,710
around the place,
Mrs. Grant.

1681
01:29:00,793 --> 01:29:02,545
Thank you, Lexie.
Bit by bit.

1682
01:29:02,628 --> 01:29:05,048
-Yeah, Mom's good with a tool.
-Clara!

1683
01:29:05,131 --> 01:29:06,174
Morgan!

1684
01:29:06,257 --> 01:29:08,217
Oh... [sighs]

1685
01:29:09,552 --> 01:29:12,055
How about cake?

1686
01:29:12,138 --> 01:29:14,682
As you both know, my mom
makes the best cakes ever.

1687
01:29:14,766 --> 01:29:17,226
Though, this year you must've
gotten it done really fast

1688
01:29:17,310 --> 01:29:19,520
because this morning you didn't
even remember it was my birthday.

1689
01:29:19,604 --> 01:29:21,147
No, I remembered.

1690
01:29:21,230 --> 01:29:22,982
The weirdest thing
happened, though.

1691
01:29:23,066 --> 01:29:24,859
Something about seeing you and
Miller asleep in bed together

1692
01:29:24,942 --> 01:29:27,820
just kind of knocked me
off my game a little bit.

1693
01:29:27,904 --> 01:29:29,489
We didn't sleep.

1694
01:29:29,572 --> 01:29:31,199
[stutters] Yes, we did.

1695
01:29:31,282 --> 01:29:32,533
-Clara.
-I know.

1696
01:29:32,617 --> 01:29:33,826
It's inappropriate. Stop.

1697
01:29:33,910 --> 01:29:37,080
[scoffs] Speaking
of not appropriate,

1698
01:29:37,163 --> 01:29:39,374
how long have you been boning
your dead friend's wife?

1699
01:29:40,416 --> 01:29:41,834
[sighs]

1700
01:29:42,460 --> 01:29:43,586
Clara...

1701
01:29:44,379 --> 01:29:46,005
[glass clinks]

1702
01:29:46,589 --> 01:29:47,715
A toast.

1703
01:29:48,424 --> 01:29:50,760
To my mother.

1704
01:29:50,843 --> 01:29:52,345
This year, she has gone

1705
01:29:52,428 --> 01:29:54,180
from the most predictable
housewife ever

1706
01:29:54,263 --> 01:29:56,933
to starring in her own
"Real Housewife" show.

1707
01:29:57,016 --> 01:29:59,310
Drama and scandal
at every turn.

1708
01:29:59,394 --> 01:30:02,313
As for me, I will be
skipping season two,

1709
01:30:02,397 --> 01:30:05,817
because I got accepted
into UNCSA's drama program.

1710
01:30:07,485 --> 01:30:08,486
What?

1711
01:30:08,569 --> 01:30:10,029
Yay!

1712
01:30:10,113 --> 01:30:11,531
Cheers to me.

1713
01:30:11,614 --> 01:30:13,324
Okay, I can't do this.
Thank you, Mrs. Grant.

1714
01:30:13,408 --> 01:30:15,535
Thank you, Mr. Sullivan.
Enjoy dinner.

1715
01:30:16,285 --> 01:30:17,870
Miller?

1716
01:30:18,830 --> 01:30:19,956
Clara?

1717
01:30:26,087 --> 01:30:27,588
[sighs]

1718
01:30:27,672 --> 01:30:29,340
Lexie, I think you should
head home right about now.

1719
01:30:29,424 --> 01:30:31,300
I'm staying over,
remember?

1720
01:30:32,510 --> 01:30:35,346
We've all got to ride
this shit out together.

1721
01:30:35,430 --> 01:30:37,974
Miller, hey, wait! Hey!

1722
01:30:38,057 --> 01:30:40,059
When were you gonna
tell me you got in?

1723
01:30:41,644 --> 01:30:43,187
[voice breaks]
I only found out today.

1724
01:30:43,271 --> 01:30:45,690
Congratulations.
I'm on the wait list.

1725
01:30:45,773 --> 01:30:48,067
-Shit. Miller.
-No!

1726
01:30:48,151 --> 01:30:50,736
You keep using me to piss your mom
off, and I'm done with it.

1727
01:30:50,820 --> 01:30:52,989
Hey, hey, you're done?

1728
01:30:53,072 --> 01:30:56,200
Okay, so what, you're just gonna sleep
with me last night and then dump me?

1729
01:30:56,284 --> 01:30:57,869
No, you don't get
to throw that in my face.

1730
01:30:57,952 --> 01:31:00,037
I was the one taken advantage
of last night, not you.

1731
01:31:00,121 --> 01:31:01,581
I'm sorry. I screwed up.

1732
01:31:01,664 --> 01:31:03,958
I mean, they disrespected

1733
01:31:04,041 --> 01:31:06,043
the two most important
people in my life,

1734
01:31:06,127 --> 01:31:08,463
and I'm supposed to sit here and
pretend like I'm fine with it?

1735
01:31:08,546 --> 01:31:11,257
When are you gonna realize you're
not the only one with problems?

1736
01:31:11,340 --> 01:31:12,967
Okay, Gramps
starts chemo next week,

1737
01:31:13,050 --> 01:31:14,719
and you're gonna go off
to some amazing school,

1738
01:31:14,802 --> 01:31:17,513
and I'm gonna be stuck here
in Nowheresville.

1743
01:31:33,529 --> 01:31:34,655
Hey.

1744
01:31:35,781 --> 01:31:40,119
So it seems like now
is the perfect time...

1745
01:31:40,203 --> 01:31:41,329
-[bottles clink]
-...to give you

1746
01:31:41,412 --> 01:31:43,331

1748
01:31:46,125 --> 01:31:47,710
Let's get out of here.
[sniffles]

1749
01:31:47,793 --> 01:31:49,545
What? Wait.
Where are we going?

1750
01:31:49,629 --> 01:31:51,422
I want to see my dad
and Aunt Jenny.

1751
01:31:51,506 --> 01:31:53,132
[engine starts]

1752
01:32:01,224 --> 01:32:02,934
Did they really just take off?

1753

[owl hooting]

1754
01:32:06,979 --> 01:32:08,898
I miss you, Aunt Jenny.

1755
01:32:08,981 --> 01:32:11,150
-We miss you so much.
-Mmm...

1756
01:32:11,651 --> 01:32:12,860
Oh.

1757
01:32:15,238 --> 01:32:17,281
You were like my best friend.

1758
01:32:18,157 --> 01:32:19,408
-It was...
-Go ahead.

1759
01:32:19,492 --> 01:32:21,077
No, you know what I mean.

1760
01:32:21,160 --> 01:32:23,496
Yeah. No, I get it.
She was cool as shit.

1761
01:32:23,579 --> 01:32:26,415
-Mmm...
-Pour one out for the--

1762
01:32:26,499 --> 01:32:28,459
-Yeah.
-Yeah. Drink up, girl.

1763
01:32:28,543 --> 01:32:30,461
Good call.
She liked this stuff.

1764
01:32:30,545 --> 01:32:33,214
-Yeah. I do, too.
-Mmm...

1765
01:32:34,465 --> 01:32:36,467
Let's, um...
Let's go see my dad.

1766
01:32:36,551 --> 01:32:38,052
Yeah, lead the way.

1767
01:32:38,135 --> 01:32:40,471
[both chattering indistinctly]

1768
01:32:57,572 --> 01:33:01,909
[yawning] Can you believe
I am dating Efren?

1769
01:33:04,453 --> 01:33:08,040
Can you believe I lost
my virginity to Miller?

1770
01:33:08,124 --> 01:33:10,501
[snickers] No.

1771
01:33:10,585 --> 01:33:14,213
Wait. And like what,
are you guys broken up now?

1772
01:33:17,592 --> 01:33:19,760
[sighs] I don't even know.

1773
01:33:19,844 --> 01:33:21,721
Hmm...

1774
01:33:21,804 --> 01:33:23,306
I mean,
I'd break up with me.

1775
01:33:23,389 --> 01:33:25,099
I mean, it's, like...
[voice cracks]

1776
01:33:28,978 --> 01:33:30,313
I don't know.

1777
01:33:32,982 --> 01:33:35,735
Part of me did it to hurt
her, and then I just...

1778
01:33:37,153 --> 01:33:38,988
ended up hurting him.

1779
01:33:41,240 --> 01:33:44,160
Like a walking disaster.

1780
01:33:53,836 --> 01:33:56,464
[crying]
All of this is my fault.

1781
01:33:57,798 --> 01:34:01,886
[sobbing] I'm so sorry, Dad.

1782
01:34:08,726 --> 01:34:11,479
-[Lexie grunts softly]
-[Morgan] Clara?

1783
01:34:13,606 --> 01:34:15,316
We need to talk.

[retches]

1785
01:34:23,616 --> 01:34:25,201
Bye, car.

1786
01:34:26,661 --> 01:34:28,871
[toilet flushing]

1787
01:34:31,707 --> 01:34:34,043
I'm never drinking again.

1788
01:34:35,461 --> 01:34:37,129
It's all my fault.

1789
01:34:37,213 --> 01:34:40,633
Aww... You got angry
at your mom and you got drunk.

1790
01:34:40,716 --> 01:34:44,345
It happens to almost
every teenager in the world.

1791
01:34:44,428 --> 01:34:46,097
The accident.

1792
01:34:47,390 --> 01:34:49,433
It was my fault.

1793
01:34:51,394 --> 01:34:52,728
What?

1794
01:35:04,907 --> 01:35:08,411
-[sighs] My head.
-Yeah, that's gonna hurt. A lot.

1795
01:35:08,494 --> 01:35:10,746
Here, sit down. Take this.

1796
01:35:25,302 --> 01:35:27,638
Last night you said something,

1797
01:35:27,722 --> 01:35:29,306
and I wanted
to ask you about it.

1798
01:35:29,390 --> 01:35:31,642
Might have been
the wine talking, but...

1799
01:35:34,353 --> 01:35:36,355
you said you...

1800
01:35:36,439 --> 01:35:38,232
blame yourself
for the accident?

1801
01:35:38,315 --> 01:35:40,609
Why would you think that?

1802
01:35:40,693 --> 01:35:42,027
I don't...

1803
01:35:45,698 --> 01:35:47,491
know. [sobs]

1804
01:35:47,575 --> 01:35:50,494
[sobbing] I mean,
it's my fault that they're dead.

1805
01:35:50,578 --> 01:35:52,371
What?

1806
01:35:54,540 --> 01:35:58,461
I mean, I didn't know
that she was driving.

1807
01:35:59,170 --> 01:36:01,380
And I was just...

1808
01:36:02,965 --> 01:36:05,092
text bombing Jenny,
and now they're...

1809
01:36:05,176 --> 01:36:08,012
Oh, my God, sweetheart,
sweetheart, she was not driving.

1810
01:36:08,095 --> 01:36:10,139
Your dad was driving.

1811
01:36:10,222 --> 01:36:13,517
It is so not your fault.
It is not your fault.

1812
01:36:19,273 --> 01:36:21,025
What aren't you telling me?

1813
01:36:21,984 --> 01:36:24,945
Why were they
really together?

1814
01:36:26,447 --> 01:36:28,657
I didn't want to tell you this,
because...

1815
01:36:30,367 --> 01:36:32,912
I would never want you
to think less of them.

1816
01:36:34,246 --> 01:36:35,790
But your father

1817
01:36:35,873 --> 01:36:38,083
and Aunt Jenny, they were...

1818
01:36:39,668 --> 01:36:41,295
Having an affair?

1819
01:36:45,841 --> 01:36:47,593
For how long?

1820
01:36:47,676 --> 01:36:51,055
A long time, apparently.

1821
01:36:51,138 --> 01:36:53,516
But you didn't think
to tell me that?

1822
01:36:53,599 --> 01:36:55,851
I was trying to protect
your memories of them

1823
01:36:55,935 --> 01:36:59,605
because your dad made some
really big mistakes, yes,

1824
01:36:59,688 --> 01:37:02,191
but he also did a lot right.

1825
01:37:02,274 --> 01:37:03,943
And the same goes
for Aunt Jenny.

1826
01:37:04,026 --> 01:37:05,820
And they loved you so much.

1827
01:37:05,903 --> 01:37:08,239
You and Jonah, I saw you.

1828
01:37:08,322 --> 01:37:12,993
That was the first time
we have ever kissed, I swear.

1829
01:37:13,077 --> 01:37:15,079
I would never have done that
to your father

1830
01:37:15,162 --> 01:37:17,915
or Aunt Jenny,
especially to you. Never.

1831
01:37:19,291 --> 01:37:20,960
But they did it to you.

1832
01:37:28,092 --> 01:37:29,385
Yeah.

1833
01:37:32,763 --> 01:37:35,224
Do you regret marrying him?

1834
01:37:35,307 --> 01:37:37,768
Oh, no, no, I don't.
I couldn't.

1835
01:37:40,020 --> 01:37:43,941
I would go back and do it all
the exact same way if I could.

1836
01:37:44,024 --> 01:37:46,652
Because if even one thing
happened differently,

1837
01:37:46,735 --> 01:37:48,737
you wouldn't be here,

1838
01:37:48,821 --> 01:37:54,618
and you are the best thing
in my life for miles.

1839
01:37:56,036 --> 01:38:01,542
Clara, there is no life that
I want that you are not in.

You deserve to be happy.

1843

No regrets, right?

1844
01:38:22,187 --> 01:38:24,648
We both deserve
to be happy, okay?

1845
01:38:32,865 --> 01:38:35,326
[Lexie] Oh, my God,
what time is it?

1846
01:38:35,409 --> 01:38:37,786

be late for school.

I was wrong about everything.

I need to tell you.

01:42:44,408 --> 01:42:46,160
-Is this necessary?
-Yes!

1904
01:42:46,243 --> 01:42:49,246
-I'm gonna switch my hand. Okay.
-[continues laughing] Hello?

1905
01:42:49,329 --> 01:42:52,124
And... Okay, stop!
Or else you're gonna fall off.

1906
01:42:52,916 --> 01:42:54,710
And... Ta-da!

1907
01:42:54,793 --> 01:42:56,295
[chuckles]

1908
01:42:56,378 --> 01:42:57,838
What is this?

1909
01:42:57,921 --> 01:42:59,756
-Oh, nothing.
-[Lexie giggles]

1910
01:43:00,757 --> 01:43:01,884
Miller?

1911
01:43:03,093 --> 01:43:04,595
[Morgan] We did it.
We pulled it off.

1912
01:43:04,678 --> 01:43:06,513
What are you doing?

1913
01:43:06,597 --> 01:43:10,392
-Humor me. Grab a seat. Grab some popcorn!
-[Clara chuckles]

1914
01:43:10,475 --> 01:43:12,227
Hello.

1915
01:43:12,311 --> 01:43:13,478
I know, right?

1916
01:43:13,562 --> 01:43:14,813
-He's starting.
-Is it starting?

1917
01:43:14,897 --> 01:43:16,190
[Miller] Yeah.
Is this fine? Yeah, okay.

1918
01:43:16,273 --> 01:43:17,691
[indistinct chattering]

1919
01:43:17,774 --> 01:43:19,359
-Squeeze.
-Okay.

1920
01:43:19,443 --> 01:43:21,403
[Efren] Yeah, okay.

1921
01:43:21,486 --> 01:43:24,615
[Miller] Okay, I want
to start off with saying,

1922
01:43:24,698 --> 01:43:28,619
thank you, everyone,
for being here tonight. Um...

1923
01:43:28,702 --> 01:43:32,706
As we all know, I was on
the wait list for film school.

1924
01:43:33,832 --> 01:43:35,000
And, um...

1925
01:43:37,044 --> 01:43:38,212
I got in.

1926
01:43:38,295 --> 01:43:41,006
-[all cheering]
-[Gramps] Attaboy!

1927
01:43:41,089 --> 01:43:43,175
I'll be darned. Good for you.

1928
01:43:43,258 --> 01:43:48,305
But I'm going to defer and
stick around here for a while

1929
01:43:48,388 --> 01:43:51,391
and take care of my gramps the
next couple rounds of chemo.

1930
01:43:51,475 --> 01:43:54,394
That's a bunch of horseshit.

1931
01:43:54,478 --> 01:43:56,855
Boy, I've been telling you
since you were a little fart

1932
01:43:56,939 --> 01:43:58,440
you could have my air.

1933
01:43:58,523 --> 01:43:59,900
My air rights.

1934
01:43:59,983 --> 01:44:01,485
I bought them
when your gram and me

1935
01:44:01,568 --> 01:44:03,111
lived in New York,
back in the day.

1936
01:44:03,195 --> 01:44:04,655
What are you talking about?

1937
01:44:04,738 --> 01:44:08,951
Well, in big cities,
you can buy the rights to air.

1938
01:44:09,034 --> 01:44:11,495
So that, you know,
people can't build

1939
01:44:11,578 --> 01:44:14,581
in front of your building
or on top of you.

1940
01:44:14,665 --> 01:44:18,877
And I've owned a little piece
in Union Square worth about...

1941
01:44:18,961 --> 01:44:20,462
I don't know,
half a million dollars

1942
01:44:20,545 --> 01:44:22,172
-last time I checked.
-[gasps]

1943
01:44:22,256 --> 01:44:25,259
But the point is we got
enough money to afford

1944
01:44:25,342 --> 01:44:30,222
any home health care
if necessary and your tuition.

1945
01:44:30,305 --> 01:44:31,723
[chuckles]

1946
01:44:31,807 --> 01:44:34,309
Uh, this is...

1947
01:44:34,393 --> 01:44:39,022
amazing news
that we'll talk about later.

1948
01:44:39,106 --> 01:44:40,899
Sorry. My bad.

1949
01:44:40,983 --> 01:44:42,276
-[Morgan laughs]
-But tonight

1950
01:44:42,359 --> 01:44:44,194
is about you, Clara.

1951
01:44:45,362 --> 01:44:46,655
And this movie is for you.

1952
01:44:46,738 --> 01:44:50,284
And naturally, you're the star.

1953
01:44:51,285 --> 01:44:53,245
-Efren, hit it.
-[Morgan gasps]

1954
01:44:54,288 --> 01:44:55,789
[Gramps chuckles]

1955
01:44:59,084 --> 01:45:01,003
It's been 14 years, Mama.

1956
01:45:01,628 --> 01:45:03,380
I'm dead.

1957
01:45:03,463 --> 01:45:06,550
You're a grandmother, Mama.
Don't you remember?

1958
01:45:06,633 --> 01:45:08,593
[Miller over speakers] Hey,
Efren, take the camera from me.

1959
01:45:08,677 --> 01:45:10,971
[Efren over speakers]
Yeah, got it, got it.

1960
01:45:11,054 --> 01:45:13,181
I directed this part. This...

1961
01:45:13,265 --> 01:45:15,475
-Shut up. She's acting.
-Okay. Sorry. Sorry.

1962
01:45:15,559 --> 01:45:18,937
Look at my grandson.
I think he's in love.

1963
01:45:19,021 --> 01:45:20,314
-[thuds]
-[chuckles]

1964
01:45:20,397 --> 01:45:23,317
[Clara] Let us
look at one another.

1965
01:45:23,400 --> 01:45:24,943
What's her name?

1966
01:45:25,027 --> 01:45:27,696
[Clara] I can't go on.
I never realized...

1967
01:45:27,779 --> 01:45:28,905
Uh, Clara.

1968
01:45:29,531 --> 01:45:30,657
Clara Grant.

1969
01:45:32,617 --> 01:45:34,745
Take me back.

1970
01:45:34,828 --> 01:45:36,747
Up the hill to my grave.

1971
01:45:37,789 --> 01:45:39,666
Oh, earth,
you're too wonderful

1972
01:45:39,750 --> 01:45:42,377
for anybody
to actually realize you.

1973
01:45:42,461 --> 01:45:46,298
Do any human beings actually
realize life while they live it?

1974
01:45:47,299 --> 01:45:49,885
Every... Every minute?

1975
01:45:52,137 --> 01:45:54,514
Hey, Clara, um...

1976
01:45:54,598 --> 01:45:56,350
I know you said
no lame promposals,

1977
01:45:56,433 --> 01:45:58,602
but I kind of already started
this before you said that.

1978
01:45:58,685 --> 01:46:00,604
So I hope you like it.

1979
01:46:00,687 --> 01:46:05,275
[sighs] Clara... I think you
should go to prom with me.

1980
01:46:08,570 --> 01:46:10,906
-What's up, dude?
-[Clara chuckling] Hey!

1981
01:46:10,989 --> 01:46:12,407
-[squeals]
-[Miller chuckles]

1982
01:46:12,491 --> 01:46:14,201
You're a little preoccupied
with some goats,

1983
01:46:14,284 --> 01:46:16,244
but I still think you should
go to prom with me.

1984
01:46:16,328 --> 01:46:18,121
Maybe don't bring the goats.

1985
01:46:18,205 --> 01:46:20,832
-Those are my goats!
-[laughter]

1986
01:46:20,916 --> 01:46:22,250
Those are mine.

1987
01:46:22,334 --> 01:46:24,711
Clara, I think you
should go to prom with me.

1988
01:46:24,795 --> 01:46:26,797
[scoffing] Yeah, right.
Whatever, dude.

1989
01:46:27,339 --> 01:46:28,965
[laughter]

1990
01:46:29,049 --> 01:46:32,052
[exhales] Okay, so here's
the thing, Clara Grant.

1991
01:46:32,135 --> 01:46:35,222
You just drove by and I know
you saw me standing here.

1992
01:46:35,305 --> 01:46:37,265
I do have a girlfriend, but...

1993
01:46:38,934 --> 01:46:40,685
all I think about
is you, so...

1994
01:46:40,769 --> 01:46:42,938
if you turn around
and offer me a ride,

1995
01:46:43,021 --> 01:46:45,107
I'll take that as a sign and
I'll break up with my girlfriend

1996
01:46:45,190 --> 01:46:48,026
and I'll eventually ask you out.
But if you don't...

1997
01:46:48,110 --> 01:46:51,071
I'll just assume
that we weren't meant to be.

1998
01:46:54,825 --> 01:46:55,951
You're coming back.

1999
01:46:56,576 --> 01:46:57,994
[gasps]

2000
01:47:00,622 --> 01:47:03,625
Okay, what do you say,
Clara Grant?

2001
01:47:03,708 --> 01:47:05,252
Will you go to prom with me?

2002
01:47:06,670 --> 01:47:08,713
Of course I will.

2003
01:47:08,797 --> 01:47:11,508
-Oh... Yay!
-Oh, wow.

2004
01:47:11,591 --> 01:47:13,427
[applause]

2005
01:47:13,510 --> 01:47:16,304
-Yay.
-Oh, yay!

2006
01:47:16,388 --> 01:47:18,306
[Lexie] Oh, my goodness!

2007
01:47:20,517 --> 01:47:23,019
-I should have just made you a video.
-[chuckles]

2008
01:47:23,103 --> 01:47:24,646
Could have saved us
a lot of time.

2009
01:47:24,729 --> 01:47:26,273
It's so true.

2010
01:47:29,526 --> 01:47:31,069
Um...

2011
01:47:31,153 --> 01:47:34,114
I am so sorry to interrupt.
Miller, that was adorable.

2012
01:47:34,197 --> 01:47:35,657
Thank you, Mrs. Grant.

2013
01:47:35,740 --> 01:47:38,368
Do you mind if I steal
your prom date for a second?

2014
01:47:38,452 --> 01:47:39,953
-[chuckles]
-Go ahead.

2015
01:47:40,912 --> 01:47:42,372
[Morgan] Oh, my gosh!

2016
01:47:42,456 --> 01:47:45,125
I'm not gonna
keep you for long.

2017
01:47:45,208 --> 01:47:48,962
I just wanted to say that
watching you on that screen...

2018
01:47:49,796 --> 01:47:51,423
Clara, you're so talented.

2019
01:47:51,506 --> 01:47:55,510
And so... fearless.

2020
01:47:55,594 --> 01:47:58,847
And I don't want my fears
to hold you back. Okay?

2021
01:47:58,930 --> 01:48:01,766
I want you to follow your
passions wherever they take you.

2022
01:48:01,850 --> 01:48:05,437
I want you to ignore everything
and everyone. Even me.

2023
01:48:06,229 --> 01:48:07,898
-Mostly.
-[chuckles]

2024
01:48:07,981 --> 01:48:10,442
I'm just blown away
by the person you are.

2025
01:48:12,486 --> 01:48:14,905
I'm only who I am
because of you.

2026
01:48:16,364 --> 01:48:18,492
You got me this far.
[chuckles]

2027
01:48:18,575 --> 01:48:22,746
My God,
such a sweet thing to say.

2028
01:48:22,829 --> 01:48:24,706
I'm proud of you, too, Mom.

2029
01:48:24,789 --> 01:48:26,124
Thank you.

2030
01:48:28,418 --> 01:48:29,794
-I love you.
-I love you.

2031
01:48:29,878 --> 01:48:31,421
-Jinx! [chuckles]
-Jinx!

2032
01:48:31,505 --> 01:48:33,298
[Morgan] Now I'll make you
buy me a soda

2033
01:48:33,381 --> 01:48:35,467
because
it's a very special day.

2034
01:48:35,550 --> 01:48:37,844
I brought
your prom date back.
