1
00:00:50,137 --> 00:00:51,359
Somebody told me once

2
00:00:51,442 --> 00:00:52,752
I fought like I was
trying to destroy

3
00:00:52,835 --> 00:00:54,619
everyone who'd ever
done me wrong.

4
00:00:56,012 --> 00:00:58,145
They said I fought like
I had demons in me.

5
00:01:00,451 --> 00:01:01,844
Maybe it's true.

6
00:01:03,106 --> 00:01:04,629
Maybe I do.

7
00:01:22,517 --> 00:01:24,827
First time I ever
stepped in a boxing ring though,

8
00:01:24,910 --> 00:01:27,004
all I knew was I had to beat
the shit out of that bitch

9
00:01:27,087 --> 00:01:29,263
before she had a chance
to hit me.

10
00:02:06,082 --> 00:02:07,388
Hi!

11
00:02:10,347 --> 00:02:11,392
Hey Momma!

12
00:02:16,179 --> 00:02:18,268
Something's up.
They're being weird.

13
00:02:18,877 --> 00:02:20,227
Check this out.

14
00:02:22,142 --> 00:02:23,103
You won?

15
00:02:23,186 --> 00:02:24,104
-No way.
-Mm-hm.

16
00:02:24,187 --> 00:02:26,624
-Did you get hit?
-Hardly.

17
00:02:26,929 --> 00:02:29,109
I don't know, my eyes were
closed half the time.

18
00:02:29,192 --> 00:02:31,111
Easiest three hundred bucks
I ever made.

19
00:02:31,194 --> 00:02:34,462
-I can't believe you did that.
-I know, me neither.

20
00:02:34,545 --> 00:02:36,116
Three hundred bucks?

21
00:02:36,199 --> 00:02:37,465
Jesus Christ...

22
00:02:37,548 --> 00:02:39,250
Randy Salters!
Language.

23
00:02:39,333 --> 00:02:40,947
Sis won the
Toughman competition.

24
00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:42,510
Check this out.

25
00:03:07,665 --> 00:03:09,101
What's going on?

26
00:03:09,798 --> 00:03:11,452
Why is nobody talking?

27
00:03:14,585 --> 00:03:15,418
Dad!

28
00:03:17,501 --> 00:03:19,551
We'll talk about it after lunch.

29
00:03:19,634 --> 00:03:21,205
What's going on?

30
00:03:21,288 --> 00:03:22,380
Why can't you just...

31
00:03:22,463 --> 00:03:24,029
Pam Doolan called me.

32
00:03:26,945 --> 00:03:27,907
About what?

33
00:03:27,990 --> 00:03:29,038
I don't know.

34
00:03:29,121 --> 00:03:31,167
Maybe she's
confused or something.

35
00:03:32,647 --> 00:03:36,999
But she said some
horrible, horrible things,

36
00:03:37,695 --> 00:03:40,045
about you and that girl.

37
00:03:40,698 --> 00:03:41,921
You know her name's Rosie.

38
00:03:42,004 --> 00:03:44,053
Oh, I don't know what
I know anymore,

39
00:03:44,136 --> 00:03:45,925
because you tell us
she's your team mate,

40
00:03:46,008 --> 00:03:47,970
and then she's your best friend,

41
00:03:48,053 --> 00:03:50,752
and now Pam is saying
this about you two.

42
00:03:51,231 --> 00:03:52,888
Now Pam is taking her
to see a priest

43
00:03:52,971 --> 00:03:54,799
to get her straightened out,

44
00:03:55,235 --> 00:03:57,241
and Dad and I think that
we should probably do

45
00:03:57,324 --> 00:03:58,633
the same with you.

46
00:03:58,716 --> 00:04:00,200
I'm not going to see a priest.

47
00:04:00,283 --> 00:04:01,897
Well, Dad and I
have discussed it

48
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:04,248
and we can't be helping you
with your rent anymore

49
00:04:04,331 --> 00:04:05,858
if you're going to
keep doing this.

50
00:04:05,941 --> 00:04:07,116
Keep doing what?

51
00:04:08,248 --> 00:04:10,250
What the hell
is a priest going to do?

52
00:04:10,728 --> 00:04:13,126
-Is it true?
-Is what true?

53
00:04:13,209 --> 00:04:15,820
-What people are saying.
-What are they saying?

54
00:04:17,474 --> 00:04:19,563
Well, we don't want you
to see her no more.

55
00:04:20,651 --> 00:04:23,267
People are gonna say it's my
fault in the way I raised you.

56
00:04:23,350 --> 00:04:26,095
Who cares what they say?
Pam Doolan is a crazy bitch.

57
00:04:26,178 --> 00:04:27,532
Why the fuck do you care
what she thinks?

58
00:04:27,615 --> 00:04:28,794
Don't you speak
to me like that...

59
00:04:28,877 --> 00:04:29,969
Why the hell not?

60
00:04:30,052 --> 00:04:31,100
You're allowed to say
whatever dumb shit

61
00:04:31,183 --> 00:04:32,580
-pops into your head.
-Stop this!

62
00:04:32,663 --> 00:04:34,361
Just stop!

63
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:45,067
What you're doing isn't normal.

64
00:04:46,938 --> 00:04:50,507
And we want you to have
a happy, normal life.

65
00:04:56,513 --> 00:04:58,650
I'm just gonna
go talk to the priest.

66
00:04:58,733 --> 00:05:00,869
I have to do it.
If I don't at least talk to him,

67
00:05:00,952 --> 00:05:02,958
she's gonna cut off
my allowance.

68
00:05:03,041 --> 00:05:05,783
-Just get a job.
-What job?

69
00:05:06,436 --> 00:05:08,268
She's gonna stop paying
for my apartment.

70
00:05:08,351 --> 00:05:09,269
Her cousin has a room.

71
00:05:09,352 --> 00:05:10,836
She wants me to move in there.

72
00:05:10,919 --> 00:05:12,098
What for?

73
00:05:12,181 --> 00:05:15,227
To keep an eye on me.
Why do you think?

74
00:05:16,925 --> 00:05:18,318
I can't stay.

75
00:05:19,754 --> 00:05:21,408
I gotta go.

76
00:05:33,071 --> 00:05:33,946
Over here!

77
00:05:34,029 --> 00:05:35,552
I got her!

78
00:05:45,127 --> 00:05:46,955
Fucking lesbian.

79
00:05:53,788 --> 00:05:55,180
Break it up now!

80
00:05:55,964 --> 00:05:57,883
Basketball is a team sport.

81
00:05:57,966 --> 00:05:59,363
You can't be on the team

82
00:05:59,446 --> 00:06:02,100
if you keep punching the
team in the face.

83
00:06:02,666 --> 00:06:04,106
It's not funny.

84
00:06:04,189 --> 00:06:05,151
She started it.

85
00:06:05,234 --> 00:06:07,327
Oh come on, Christy.
Grow up.

86
00:06:07,410 --> 00:06:08,415
Well, she fucking did.

87
00:06:08,498 --> 00:06:09,503
How?

88
00:06:09,586 --> 00:06:11,371
What did she do?

89
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:14,374
Huh?

90
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:16,680
What'd she do?

91
00:06:17,681 --> 00:06:21,424
Fuck it. Just forget about it.
It doesn't matter.

92
00:06:29,345 --> 00:06:30,955
Alright, hold your horses,
Casey.

93
00:06:31,347 --> 00:06:33,001
I got you some right here.

94
00:06:33,523 --> 00:06:34,568
Here you go.

95
00:06:35,525 --> 00:06:36,878
You're a madman.

96
00:06:36,961 --> 00:06:39,050
Oh, shit.

97
00:06:42,184 --> 00:06:43,624
Hello, Christy speaking.

98
00:06:43,707 --> 00:06:45,670
Christy,
this is Richard Christmas.

99
00:06:45,753 --> 00:06:48,281
I work for Larry Carrier.
He asked me to call you.

100
00:06:48,364 --> 00:06:50,718
-Sorry, Larry who?
-Larry Carrier.

101
00:06:50,801 --> 00:06:53,068
He's a boxing promoter out
here in Bristol, Tennessee.

102
00:06:53,151 --> 00:06:56,420
Larry saw you fight a few weeks
ago at the Toughman contest.

103
00:06:56,503 --> 00:06:58,117
He owns the Bristol Speedway

104
00:06:58,200 --> 00:06:59,466
and he's putting
a show together.

105
00:06:59,549 --> 00:07:00,815
He wants to know
how you'd feel about

106
00:07:00,898 --> 00:07:02,725
making your
professional boxing debut.

107
00:07:03,814 --> 00:07:06,908
I'm not... I play basketball.

108
00:07:06,991 --> 00:07:08,388
I'm not a boxer, sir.

109
00:07:08,471 --> 00:07:10,477
I've never been in a
boxing gym in my life.

110
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:12,261
I entered Toughman for fun.

111
00:07:12,344 --> 00:07:14,699
Well, Larry liked
the way you fought.

112
00:07:14,782 --> 00:07:16,918
We'll put you up in a
nice hotel for the night,

113
00:07:17,001 --> 00:07:19,007
and the purse is
five hundred dollars.

114
00:07:19,090 --> 00:07:20,962
How's that sound?

115
00:07:35,542 --> 00:07:37,848
Come on.

116
00:07:41,373 --> 00:07:42,810
Here.

117
00:07:44,376 --> 00:07:45,813
Good luck.

118
00:08:01,393 --> 00:08:03,178
Fighters, centre of the ring.

119
00:08:07,095 --> 00:08:08,840
Okay, your trunks are good here.

120
00:08:08,923 --> 00:08:10,232
Your trunks are good here.

121
00:08:10,315 --> 00:08:12,191
I already explained to you
the rules earlier.

122
00:08:12,274 --> 00:08:13,845
Protect yourself at all times.

123
00:08:13,928 --> 00:08:16,064
If I say "stop" while
you're fighting, stop!

124
00:08:16,147 --> 00:08:17,239
Do you have any questions?

125
00:08:17,322 --> 00:08:18,719
You have any questions?

126
00:08:18,802 --> 00:08:20,674
Touch gloves.
Go back to your corners.

127
00:08:32,294 --> 00:08:34,209
Start!

128
00:08:53,707 --> 00:08:57,584
One! Two! Three!
Four! Five!

129
00:08:57,667 --> 00:08:59,499
Get up! Get up!

130
00:08:59,582 --> 00:09:04,412
Six! Seven!
Eight! Nine! Ten!

131
00:09:15,598 --> 00:09:18,300
-Look at you.
-Stop.

132
00:09:18,383 --> 00:09:21,517
Christy. Larry Carrier.

133
00:09:22,605 --> 00:09:26,174
You did great.
Well done.

134
00:09:28,263 --> 00:09:30,308
-Thank you, sir.
-You earned that.

135
00:09:31,788 --> 00:09:33,098
That was fun.

136
00:09:33,181 --> 00:09:35,620
Hey, let me talk to you
about something real quick.

137
00:09:44,018 --> 00:09:46,020
I loved what I saw
out there tonight.

138
00:09:46,934 --> 00:09:48,853
I got a trainer who
wants to meet you.

139
00:09:48,936 --> 00:09:51,072
His name's Jim Martin.
He's an excellent trainer.

140
00:09:51,155 --> 00:09:52,900
Trains my son,
as a matter of fact.

141
00:09:52,983 --> 00:09:54,032
Why don't you come up next week

142
00:09:54,115 --> 00:09:55,725
for a couple of days
and meet him?

143
00:09:55,943 --> 00:09:58,340
Have a look around my gym,
work out with him some.

144
00:09:58,423 --> 00:09:59,820
See if you like it.

145
00:09:59,903 --> 00:10:01,822
If you do,
I want to promote you.

146
00:10:01,905 --> 00:10:03,254
Get you more fights.

147
00:10:05,692 --> 00:10:06,871
Yeah, okay, sure.

148
00:10:06,954 --> 00:10:08,481
Maybe you want to bring
your father up with you.

149
00:10:08,564 --> 00:10:11,615
Um, my dad can't
take time off work.

150
00:10:11,698 --> 00:10:13,569
Okay, well, bring your mom then.

151
00:10:14,222 --> 00:10:16,184
Just your mom. Jim's a...

152
00:10:16,267 --> 00:10:19,749
He's a family guy.
You understand me?

153
00:10:25,929 --> 00:10:27,195
Yes, sir.

154
00:10:27,278 --> 00:10:28,762
He's excited to meet you,
Christy.

155
00:10:28,845 --> 00:10:31,040
Let's see if we can't
make a boxer out of you.

156
00:11:01,051 --> 00:11:02,662
Can I help you?

157
00:11:03,053 --> 00:11:04,925
I'm looking for Jim Martin.

158
00:11:05,926 --> 00:11:07,928
That's him, over by the ring.

159
00:11:10,757 --> 00:11:13,455
Excuse me.
Are you Jim Martin?

160
00:11:14,108 --> 00:11:15,200
I'm Christy Salters.

161
00:11:15,283 --> 00:11:17,594
Mr. Carrier told me
you'd be expecting me.

162
00:11:17,677 --> 00:11:18,899
I'm here to train with you.

163
00:11:18,982 --> 00:11:20,723
Hands up!

164
00:11:21,419 --> 00:11:23,334
-Sir!
-What?

165
00:11:23,683 --> 00:11:25,645
I'm working.
Tony's trying to concentrate.

166
00:11:25,728 --> 00:11:27,164
What do you want?

167
00:11:31,647 --> 00:11:34,045
Hey, where you going, hmm?

168
00:11:34,128 --> 00:11:36,351
-Christy! You made it!
-He doesn't want to train me.

169
00:11:36,434 --> 00:11:38,136
-He's an asshole.
-Christy!

170
00:11:38,219 --> 00:11:40,529
-Jim! Hey Jim!
-Yep?

171
00:11:40,612 --> 00:11:42,310
Get down here.

172
00:11:42,789 --> 00:11:43,964
Keep it up, fellas.

173
00:11:45,922 --> 00:11:47,536
Jim, this is, ah,
Christy Salters.

174
00:11:47,619 --> 00:11:49,364
Told you she was
coming in today.

175
00:11:49,447 --> 00:11:52,450
Oh, yeah. Hi, Christy.
Pleased to meet you.

176
00:11:55,192 --> 00:11:56,589
Hey, Jim Martin.

177
00:11:56,672 --> 00:11:59,806
-I'm Joyce. I'm Christy's mum.
-Pleasure.

178
00:12:02,417 --> 00:12:04,989
Larry paid for
the hotel already.

179
00:12:05,072 --> 00:12:07,161
You said you were
gonna give it a try.

180
00:12:07,683 --> 00:12:10,777
I said I'd come and
check it out. I checked it out.

181
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:13,040
The guy's a dick.
I wanna go home.

182
00:12:13,123 --> 00:12:17,305
I just think if Larry's offering
you a place to stay, rent-free

183
00:12:17,388 --> 00:12:20,004
and a job, and a trainer,

184
00:12:20,087 --> 00:12:21,566
that's a real opportunity.

185
00:12:22,002 --> 00:12:23,529
And now you're just
being ungrateful.

186
00:12:23,612 --> 00:12:27,964
He don't wanna train me.
You saw it. It was embarrassing.

187
00:12:29,444 --> 00:12:32,494
Well, fine.
We'll go home.

188
00:12:32,577 --> 00:12:34,322
Didn't come all the way
down here

189
00:12:34,405 --> 00:12:36,934
thinking you were going to
quit so easy is all.

190
00:12:37,017 --> 00:12:39,545
And just 'cause a man said
something mean to you,

191
00:12:39,628 --> 00:12:41,499
well that's how training works.

192
00:12:41,978 --> 00:12:45,808
It's tough. It is supposed
to toughen you up.

193
00:12:49,029 --> 00:12:50,334
Hmm...

194
00:12:51,379 --> 00:12:54,121
I honestly thought you
was tough already.

195
00:12:57,167 --> 00:12:58,825
I want to see how you move.

196
00:12:58,908 --> 00:13:01,828
Use your jab. Show me
some of your combinations.

197
00:13:01,911 --> 00:13:02,916
Nothing too fancy.

198
00:13:02,999 --> 00:13:04,653
Walt, go easy on her.

199
00:13:06,481 --> 00:13:08,309
Let's see what you got.

200
00:13:09,223 --> 00:13:10,964
Get her out of here.

201
00:13:14,881 --> 00:13:17,622
Bust her up. Break a rib
if you have to.

202
00:13:54,703 --> 00:13:55,791
I'm sorry.

203
00:13:56,270 --> 00:13:57,579
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to.

204
00:13:57,662 --> 00:14:00,578
-Jesus Christ.
-I'm sorry.

205
00:14:01,666 --> 00:14:03,190
Huh.

206
00:14:39,313 --> 00:14:40,880
Alright, Christy, this is you.

207
00:14:42,142 --> 00:14:44,492
Utilities are all paid for.

208
00:14:45,058 --> 00:14:46,715
Telephone's connected
to the office,

209
00:14:46,798 --> 00:14:48,195
so any calls that
come through for you,

210
00:14:48,278 --> 00:14:49,457
they'll just patch them over.

211
00:14:49,540 --> 00:14:53,240
After hours,
calls come directly to you.

212
00:14:53,718 --> 00:14:54,723
If anyone calls the office,

213
00:14:54,806 --> 00:14:57,248
then just take a
message for Polly.

214
00:14:57,331 --> 00:15:00,207
Or, you could have Polly have
them all go to the machine,

215
00:15:00,290 --> 00:15:02,557
but then that means that
nobody can call you at night.

216
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:03,994
I'm guessing you
don't want that.

217
00:15:04,077 --> 00:15:05,730
You can figure
it out with Polly.

218
00:15:06,209 --> 00:15:08,215
Anything else, give me a call.

219
00:15:08,298 --> 00:15:09,826
You only got twelve days
before this next fight,

220
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:11,345
so make 'em count.

221
00:15:12,215 --> 00:15:13,220
No problem.

222
00:15:13,303 --> 00:15:14,783
Alright.

223
00:15:21,224 --> 00:15:22,617
Get over here.

224
00:15:37,675 --> 00:15:41,027
Push off the back foot,
step, snap the punch.

225
00:16:03,179 --> 00:16:04,180
Elbows in!

226
00:16:05,051 --> 00:16:06,578
What's your hand doing?
Get your hands up

227
00:16:06,661 --> 00:16:09,011
or you're gonna get yourself
knocked on your ass.

228
00:16:51,314 --> 00:16:52,750
What'd ya eat?

229
00:16:53,403 --> 00:16:54,448
A burger.

230
00:16:54,796 --> 00:16:57,233
Yeah, I come for the steaks.
The steaks are good.

231
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:05,067
You wanna sit?

232
00:17:09,115 --> 00:17:10,246
Sure.

233
00:17:14,033 --> 00:17:15,603
-Well, hey Jim.
-Hey.

234
00:17:15,686 --> 00:17:16,778
Just the usual?

235
00:17:16,861 --> 00:17:18,519
-Appreciate it.
-Okay.

236
00:17:18,602 --> 00:17:20,304
Are you gonna have
the pie again, hon?

237
00:17:20,387 --> 00:17:23,042
-Yes please, ma'am.
-She'll just have coffee.

238
00:17:24,608 --> 00:17:25,653
I don't want coffee.

239
00:17:26,045 --> 00:17:28,047
Well, I don't want to
train a fat fighter.

240
00:17:31,528 --> 00:17:32,650
Just the check, please.

241
00:17:40,929 --> 00:17:43,671
You work harder than
most of the men I train.

242
00:17:44,715 --> 00:17:46,587
I'm training my ass off.

243
00:17:48,415 --> 00:17:50,203
Larry's a smart guy.

244
00:17:50,286 --> 00:17:51,813
He seems to think

245
00:17:51,896 --> 00:17:55,339
there's something to this lady
boxing business, I don't know.

246
00:17:55,422 --> 00:17:56,771
We'll see.

247
00:17:57,293 --> 00:17:58,773
Maybe he's right.

248
00:17:59,426 --> 00:18:03,038
Maybe I'm gonna make you the
best woman fighter in the world.

249
00:19:00,965 --> 00:19:02,750
How you feeling?

250
00:19:04,230 --> 00:19:05,796
Good, I think.

251
00:19:07,929 --> 00:19:10,932
Just jab, jab, jab.
Turn her like a top.

252
00:19:11,933 --> 00:19:14,457
I'm gonna go watch 'em
wrap Whitcomb's hands.

253
00:19:18,244 --> 00:19:19,636
You look cute.

254
00:20:27,835 --> 00:20:29,101
You look good in there.

255
00:20:29,184 --> 00:20:30,494
Just keep snapping
those jabs, yeah?

256
00:20:30,577 --> 00:20:32,231
Move your head.
Jab, jab, jab.

257
00:20:39,716 --> 00:20:41,151
Go back.

258
00:20:42,980 --> 00:20:44,765
Yeah!

259
00:20:46,462 --> 00:20:49,948
Five! Six!

260
00:20:50,031 --> 00:20:53,256
Seven! Eight!

261
00:20:53,339 --> 00:20:56,559
Nine! Ten!

262
00:20:56,907 --> 00:21:00,433
Yeah! Yeah!

263
00:21:07,788 --> 00:21:11,099
Well done!
Yeah! Okay!

264
00:21:11,182 --> 00:21:12,623
Can you fucking believe this?

265
00:21:12,706 --> 00:21:14,102
I mean, it felt so great.

266
00:21:14,185 --> 00:21:15,669
I don't even know
how to describe it,

267
00:21:15,752 --> 00:21:16,757
but it was fucking amazing.

268
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:18,237
I mean, this other girl,
she was tough,

269
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:20,370
but she was slow so I kept
slipping all of her punches

270
00:21:20,453 --> 00:21:22,110
and all my jabs were landing.

271
00:21:22,193 --> 00:21:25,849
It was just...
I think I've found my thing.

272
00:21:26,241 --> 00:21:27,551
I bet most people
go their entire lives

273
00:21:27,634 --> 00:21:29,780
and they don't even know
what their thing is.

274
00:21:30,158 --> 00:21:31,642
Here, take this.

275
00:21:31,725 --> 00:21:33,640
Alright. Let's go.

276
00:21:34,554 --> 00:21:36,251
Rosie, you still there?

277
00:21:37,252 --> 00:21:39,210
So, boxing's your thing?

278
00:21:40,429 --> 00:21:43,436
Yeah, maybe.
I mean, I don't know.

279
00:21:43,519 --> 00:21:45,478
I'm really fucking good at it.

280
00:21:47,393 --> 00:21:49,873
But it's not a career, is it?

281
00:21:53,050 --> 00:21:55,013
I've got another
fight in six weeks.

282
00:21:55,096 --> 00:21:57,189
I was thinking maybe you might
want to come to it.

283
00:21:57,272 --> 00:22:00,319
Yeah, maybe.
I don't know.

284
00:22:07,108 --> 00:22:10,942
Larry's also got me a job at the
supply store next to the gym.

285
00:22:11,025 --> 00:22:12,509
For a little extra cash...

286
00:22:12,592 --> 00:22:15,163
Christy, I wanted to do
this face to face, I did.

287
00:22:15,246 --> 00:22:20,295
But also, I just need to
come out and say it.

288
00:22:21,296 --> 00:22:24,477
I guess I thought this
could work, long distance,

289
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:27,955
but... I met someone.

290
00:22:29,086 --> 00:22:30,697
I met a guy.

291
00:22:31,524 --> 00:22:34,135
You'd actually like him,
I think. I don't know.

292
00:22:36,093 --> 00:22:38,182
I feel really bad about this...

293
00:22:57,985 --> 00:23:01,771
One! Two! Three!

294
00:23:02,511 --> 00:23:07,647
Four! Five! Six! Seven!

295
00:23:08,082 --> 00:23:11,176
Eight! Nine! Ten!

296
00:23:11,259 --> 00:23:14,305
Yeah! Yeah!

297
00:23:16,133 --> 00:23:17,526
That's Christy!

298
00:23:45,772 --> 00:23:47,081
Yeah!

299
00:23:47,164 --> 00:23:48,557
Yeah!

300
00:23:49,253 --> 00:23:51,386
-Oh!
-Yeah!

301
00:23:53,910 --> 00:23:55,651
Yeah!

302
00:23:58,088 --> 00:23:59,960
Whoo!

303
00:24:05,356 --> 00:24:07,010
Oh!

304
00:24:09,186 --> 00:24:11,493
-Oh, man.
-There it is. It's over there.

305
00:24:18,631 --> 00:24:19,936
You play angry.

306
00:24:21,155 --> 00:24:23,466
That is what my
basketball coach told me.

307
00:24:23,549 --> 00:24:26,904
I am too aggressive.
That's why I like boxing.

308
00:24:26,987 --> 00:24:30,951
Well, boxing is only about
five percent aggression.

309
00:24:31,034 --> 00:24:34,473
The rest of it is
strategy and control.

310
00:24:37,127 --> 00:24:38,999
It's chess.

311
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,707
You can't play chess angry,
can you?

312
00:24:42,742 --> 00:24:44,221
You're setting up moves.

313
00:24:47,224 --> 00:24:50,057
I mean, you're slipping,
you're feigning.

314
00:24:50,140 --> 00:24:51,232
You think I'm going over here,

315
00:24:51,315 --> 00:24:53,404
but I'm actually
going over here.

316
00:24:55,319 --> 00:24:57,104
You're playing a character.

317
00:24:58,105 --> 00:25:01,935
You're the little
pretty pink character.

318
00:25:07,506 --> 00:25:09,120
You should grow your hair long.

319
00:25:09,203 --> 00:25:10,900
It'd look better longer.

320
00:25:14,774 --> 00:25:16,562
It gets in my face.

321
00:25:16,645 --> 00:25:18,778
You'd look prettier
with longer hair.

322
00:25:19,822 --> 00:25:21,524
Looks butch like that.

323
00:25:21,607 --> 00:25:23,739
Nobody wants to see
a butch girl fight.

324
00:25:24,261 --> 00:25:26,046
You know that.

325
00:25:27,526 --> 00:25:28,962
Don't you?

326
00:25:30,790 --> 00:25:32,400
I spoke to Joyce.

327
00:25:33,227 --> 00:25:36,016
She said you had to
leave West Virginia.

328
00:25:36,099 --> 00:25:38,624
She told me about Rosie.

329
00:25:40,364 --> 00:25:42,066
When did you talk to my mom?

330
00:25:42,149 --> 00:25:44,368
Why don't you have a boyfriend?

331
00:25:45,674 --> 00:25:47,807
Don't think you can get a man?

332
00:25:49,635 --> 00:25:51,031
I just...

333
00:25:51,114 --> 00:25:53,464
I just wanna put
all my energy into boxing.

334
00:25:54,335 --> 00:25:55,510
Yeah.

335
00:25:56,293 --> 00:25:57,599
I see that.

336
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:04,436
I might rag on you sometimes,

337
00:26:04,519 --> 00:26:06,351
but it's only because I
want you to work hard.

338
00:26:06,434 --> 00:26:09,959
I want you to work hard because
I think you've got something.

339
00:26:12,701 --> 00:26:14,838
I'm not sure what that
something is,

340
00:26:14,921 --> 00:26:16,662
but it's something.

341
00:26:18,577 --> 00:26:20,100
I believe that.

342
00:26:26,802 --> 00:26:28,021
Your shot.

343
00:27:16,199 --> 00:27:17,596
Hello.

344
00:27:17,679 --> 00:27:19,598
Hey there, it's Jim.

345
00:27:19,681 --> 00:27:21,117
What you doing?

346
00:27:22,945 --> 00:27:24,120
Um...

347
00:27:25,861 --> 00:27:27,384
Nothing.

348
00:27:30,257 --> 00:27:33,477
-Just sitting.
-You wanna come over?

349
00:27:41,572 --> 00:27:42,965
Hey.

350
00:27:45,228 --> 00:27:47,100
We should get to the gym.

351
00:28:13,343 --> 00:28:15,436
Johnny Salters speaking.

352
00:28:15,519 --> 00:28:16,829
Hey Dad.

353
00:28:16,912 --> 00:28:19,745
Hey, sweet pea.
How are you?

354
00:28:19,828 --> 00:28:21,656
I'm alright.

355
00:28:23,005 --> 00:28:24,833
Are you okay, honey?

356
00:28:28,141 --> 00:28:29,969
Yeah, I'm fine.

357
00:28:32,232 --> 00:28:34,060
I just miss you.

358
00:28:34,887 --> 00:28:36,932
I think I want to come home.

359
00:28:48,117 --> 00:28:49,902
Come here.

360
00:29:33,249 --> 00:29:34,860
Hey.

361
00:29:36,731 --> 00:29:38,487
I said I'd try it out
for six months.

362
00:29:39,212 --> 00:29:40,256
I did that.

363
00:29:40,822 --> 00:29:41,958
I need to start thinking about

364
00:29:42,041 --> 00:29:43,350
what I'm actually going
to do with my life.

365
00:29:43,433 --> 00:29:44,743
Boxing.

366
00:29:44,826 --> 00:29:46,397
Boxing's what you're gonna do.

367
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:48,704
-You're doing it.
-I can't make a living doing it.

368
00:29:48,787 --> 00:29:51,180
Larry can't find women
to fight me.

369
00:29:55,663 --> 00:29:57,708
I've trained a lot of guys,

370
00:29:58,666 --> 00:30:00,059
and...

371
00:30:01,887 --> 00:30:03,936
I never had one
that I really thought

372
00:30:04,019 --> 00:30:06,892
had what it takes
to go all the way.

373
00:30:08,241 --> 00:30:11,461
You're lucky if you get one
of those your whole life.

374
00:30:12,506 --> 00:30:14,551
That's what I see in you.

375
00:30:15,857 --> 00:30:17,776
I'm serious when I say

376
00:30:17,859 --> 00:30:22,081
I can make you the greatest
female fighter in the world.

377
00:30:23,473 --> 00:30:25,040
Compared to who?

378
00:30:25,911 --> 00:30:27,608
Nobody's doing it.

379
00:30:28,043 --> 00:30:29,962
Nobody's getting paid to do it.

380
00:30:30,045 --> 00:30:31,699
That's gonna change.

381
00:30:32,787 --> 00:30:36,008
Lenny Del Percio in Florida
wants to promote you.

382
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:39,755
He's got an apartment
for us in Daytona,

383
00:30:39,838 --> 00:30:41,669
and he can get us fights.

384
00:30:41,752 --> 00:30:47,062
And when the time is right,
I'll make the call to Don King.

385
00:30:51,110 --> 00:30:52,811
Don just moved back to Miami,

386
00:30:52,894 --> 00:30:55,901
and when you're ready
I'll make the call.

387
00:30:55,984 --> 00:30:59,161
But you gotta do the work.

388
00:30:59,945 --> 00:31:01,642
You gotta want it.

389
00:31:03,035 --> 00:31:05,601
Now, if you wanna
stay here in West Virginia

390
00:31:07,866 --> 00:31:09,824
I can't stop you.

391
00:31:10,956 --> 00:31:13,088
But, I don't think you do.

392
00:31:14,002 --> 00:31:15,917
I can see it in your eyes.

393
00:31:16,526 --> 00:31:18,881
And I got this real nice
situation set up

394
00:31:18,964 --> 00:31:22,532
just waiting for us in Daytona.

395
00:31:25,144 --> 00:31:26,797
Daytona Beach?

396
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:29,191
Daytona Beach.

397
00:31:33,543 --> 00:31:36,197
Daytona Beach, baby!

398
00:31:41,725 --> 00:31:43,253
Now Aaron Pryor
is a buddy of mine.

399
00:31:43,336 --> 00:31:44,728
You know Aaron Pryor.

400
00:31:45,425 --> 00:31:46,734
He's a fighter.

401
00:31:46,817 --> 00:31:49,302
Yeah, he's a fighter.
Yeah, legend from Ohio.

402
00:31:49,385 --> 00:31:50,477
Oh!

403
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:51,870
He introduced me to Mike Buffer.

404
00:31:51,953 --> 00:31:52,915
Oh!

405
00:31:52,998 --> 00:31:54,090
You know who Mike Buffer is?

406
00:31:54,173 --> 00:31:55,134
No.

407
00:31:55,217 --> 00:31:58,268
"Let's get ready
to rumble!"

408
00:31:58,351 --> 00:32:00,266
Oh my goodness!

409
00:32:44,092 --> 00:32:45,920
How far is the beach?

410
00:32:46,834 --> 00:32:50,015
I can't do this.
It doesn't feel right.

411
00:32:50,098 --> 00:32:51,974
This doesn't feel right.

412
00:32:52,057 --> 00:32:53,932
Just treat her the
same as a man.

413
00:32:54,015 --> 00:32:55,412
It's fine, Shortdog.

414
00:32:55,495 --> 00:32:57,888
Go easy on him,
Christy. He's only small.

415
00:32:58,846 --> 00:33:00,848
I'm kicking your ass next.

416
00:33:12,773 --> 00:33:14,253
Back to your corner!

417
00:33:31,922 --> 00:33:33,446
Yeah!

418
00:33:38,233 --> 00:33:40,888
Keep moving your head.
Watch the jab, use your right.

419
00:33:55,468 --> 00:33:57,712
You gotta fix that
face, Christy. Fix his face!

420
00:33:59,254 --> 00:34:00,386
Get her. Fuck her!

421
00:34:04,999 --> 00:34:06,048
Yeah!

422
00:34:06,131 --> 00:34:07,610
That's it, champ!

423
00:34:19,318 --> 00:34:20,754
Hello?

424
00:34:24,671 --> 00:34:27,108
Hey, how are you doing?

425
00:34:34,985 --> 00:34:38,163
Yeah, that'd be great.
I'd love to see you.

426
00:34:39,294 --> 00:34:41,079
Where're you thinking?

427
00:34:43,951 --> 00:34:45,518
How about two?

428
00:34:46,127 --> 00:34:48,477
Great.
Can't wait to see you.

429
00:34:50,784 --> 00:34:55,053
I've been winning.
A lot. Like every fight.

430
00:34:55,136 --> 00:34:56,576
Thanks.

431
00:34:56,659 --> 00:34:58,966
He knows a lot of
really good people.

432
00:34:59,836 --> 00:35:01,146
So yeah.

433
00:35:01,229 --> 00:35:03,375
Feels like something
really big could happen.

434
00:35:04,363 --> 00:35:06,717
That's great.
What about you and him?

435
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:09,150
-Jim?
-Mm-hm.

436
00:35:09,890 --> 00:35:12,027
It's fine.
I don't know.

437
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:15,200
-My momma loves him.
-Mm-hm.

438
00:35:16,766 --> 00:35:17,858
Every time she calls,

439
00:35:17,941 --> 00:35:20,030
she just wants to talk
to him and not me.

440
00:35:20,379 --> 00:35:21,684
What's the sex like?

441
00:35:24,861 --> 00:35:26,519
I don't know, you tell me.

442
00:35:26,602 --> 00:35:27,738
How would I know?

443
00:35:27,821 --> 00:35:29,344
Well, how's your boyfriend?

444
00:35:31,129 --> 00:35:33,570
Yeah, that didn't work out.

445
00:35:33,653 --> 00:35:35,916
-He was a dick.
-Thought you liked dicks.

446
00:35:46,231 --> 00:35:47,623
I need to talk to you.

447
00:35:49,147 --> 00:35:50,583
Jim, this is Rosie.

448
00:35:51,323 --> 00:35:52,759
Outside.

449
00:36:05,641 --> 00:36:06,472
What are you...

450
00:36:06,555 --> 00:36:07,865
Hey, don't fucking grab at me!

451
00:36:07,948 --> 00:36:09,345
What are you doing sneaking
around behind my back?

452
00:36:09,428 --> 00:36:11,867
-I'm not sneaking around!
-What's she doing here?

453
00:36:12,257 --> 00:36:13,479
She's in town
to see her grandma.

454
00:36:13,562 --> 00:36:14,611
We were just having a drink.

455
00:36:14,694 --> 00:36:16,743
How do you think
that makes me look,

456
00:36:16,826 --> 00:36:18,963
you sitting in a bar
with a damn lesbian?

457
00:36:19,046 --> 00:36:20,917
I don't know.
Who the fuck cares?

458
00:36:22,441 --> 00:36:24,094
I called your dad.

459
00:36:25,444 --> 00:36:26,840
What'd you say?

460
00:36:26,923 --> 00:36:29,709
I told him I was worried
you might be gay.

461
00:36:31,972 --> 00:36:33,365
Jim, why would you say that?

462
00:36:34,888 --> 00:36:36,716
I'm in the damn dark here.

463
00:36:37,107 --> 00:36:38,678
You're breaking his heart.

464
00:36:38,761 --> 00:36:40,506
You're gonna lose your family.

465
00:36:40,589 --> 00:36:41,551
Is that what you want?

466
00:36:41,634 --> 00:36:43,766
You're gonna lose
your trainer...

467
00:36:44,854 --> 00:36:46,382
Jim, we were just
having a drink.

468
00:36:46,465 --> 00:36:49,468
...who's turning you
into a great fighter.

469
00:36:50,643 --> 00:36:53,080
I'm the only one
who believes in you.

470
00:36:53,994 --> 00:36:57,262
I mean, I'm the guy who can pick
up the phone to Don King,

471
00:36:57,345 --> 00:36:59,046
right when you're
about to take off,

472
00:36:59,129 --> 00:37:01,571
and you're gonna go do this,
for what?

473
00:37:01,654 --> 00:37:04,051
So you can be a damn dyke
boxer nobody wants to train?

474
00:37:04,134 --> 00:37:05,788
Jim, I'm not...

475
00:37:06,485 --> 00:37:09,314
See, that in there is your past.

476
00:37:10,706 --> 00:37:11,842
Not your future.

477
00:37:11,925 --> 00:37:14,188
Your future is with me.

478
00:37:15,755 --> 00:37:17,017
You understand?

479
00:37:17,670 --> 00:37:19,149
We're right there.

480
00:37:20,368 --> 00:37:22,240
Why can't you see that?

481
00:37:23,719 --> 00:37:25,155
We're right there.

482
00:37:26,374 --> 00:37:30,813
We're... in this together.
We're a team.

483
00:37:31,727 --> 00:37:33,816
You want to lose that, huh?

484
00:37:34,904 --> 00:37:40,131
You want to lose your family,
your trainer, your career,

485
00:37:40,214 --> 00:37:41,737
all of it?

486
00:37:43,652 --> 00:37:45,132
Or do you want to marry me?

487
00:37:54,881 --> 00:37:57,235
Well, come on,
I'm on one knee, dammit.

488
00:37:57,318 --> 00:37:59,668
Christy Salters,
will you marry me?

489
00:38:00,408 --> 00:38:02,149
Fuck, just get up already.

490
00:38:04,369 --> 00:38:07,071
-Okay, just get up!
-Okay? Yes?

491
00:38:07,154 --> 00:38:08,942
-Yes, just get up.
-Yes?

492
00:38:09,025 --> 00:38:10,288
Yes! Get up, Jim.

493
00:38:13,595 --> 00:38:15,122
-Yes?
-Yes, alright.

494
00:38:15,205 --> 00:38:16,733
-Yes, alright.
-Alright!

495
00:38:16,816 --> 00:38:20,472
-Okay! Whoo!
-Alright.

496
00:38:29,959 --> 00:38:31,922
Jim and Christy Martin.

497
00:38:32,005 --> 00:38:33,445
Hey Jim, it's Johnny.

498
00:38:33,528 --> 00:38:34,925
Hey, Johnny, how you doing?

499
00:38:35,008 --> 00:38:36,143
Good. Is Christy there?

500
00:38:36,226 --> 00:38:37,449
Oh, no, you just missed her.

501
00:38:37,532 --> 00:38:38,450
She went out for a run.

502
00:38:38,533 --> 00:38:40,844
But I will tell her you called.

503
00:38:40,927 --> 00:38:42,889
And I'm in a little bit
of a rush, too.

504
00:38:42,972 --> 00:38:45,631
-Oh.
-Yeah.

505
00:38:45,714 --> 00:38:47,154
But will you send
my love to Joyce?

506
00:38:47,237 --> 00:38:49,109
-Yeah, will do.
-You take care now.

507
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:52,330
-Who was that?
-No one.

508
00:38:56,812 --> 00:38:59,036
What if I did a couple of shifts
a week down at the drugstore?

509
00:38:59,119 --> 00:39:01,121
They're looking for people.

510
00:39:01,948 --> 00:39:03,997
You wanna box, or you
wanna work at a drugstore?

511
00:39:04,080 --> 00:39:07,044
I wanna be able to pay
the damn phone bill.

512
00:39:07,127 --> 00:39:08,650
We need to earn some money.

513
00:39:11,871 --> 00:39:13,877
Or maybe I just
go back to Itmann.

514
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:16,615
If you leave me, I'll kill you.

515
00:39:17,964 --> 00:39:20,140
You just need to be seen
by the right people.

516
00:39:20,836 --> 00:39:21,841
You just keep training

517
00:39:21,924 --> 00:39:23,626
and be ready when
the opportunity comes.

518
00:39:23,709 --> 00:39:25,454
I am ready.

519
00:39:25,537 --> 00:39:27,020
I don't know what else
I'm supposed to do.

520
00:39:27,103 --> 00:39:30,154
I mean, I'm training my ass off,
I'm winning my fights.

521
00:39:30,237 --> 00:39:31,847
Well keep doing that.

522
00:39:32,631 --> 00:39:34,289
One of us has gotta get a job.

523
00:39:34,372 --> 00:39:36,552
I can't keep asking my
dad to send us money.

524
00:39:36,635 --> 00:39:37,988
I mean, why don't you
just get a job?

525
00:39:38,071 --> 00:39:40,033
I have a job.
I'm your trainer.

526
00:39:40,116 --> 00:39:42,122
Well, it's not paying
the damn bills.

527
00:39:42,205 --> 00:39:45,557
I mean, what kind of man has
a job that can't pay the bills?

528
00:40:03,966 --> 00:40:06,752
I'm not getting
enough fights and...

529
00:40:07,405 --> 00:40:10,629
And I'm not getting paid
enough when I do get 'em

530
00:40:10,712 --> 00:40:13,151
and I just want to make sure
that if we're gonna...

531
00:40:14,629 --> 00:40:15,765
I told you what you could do

532
00:40:15,848 --> 00:40:17,676
to make some more money,
didn't I?

533
00:40:18,459 --> 00:40:20,069
And you didn't want to do it,

534
00:40:20,635 --> 00:40:23,555
because you're too good for it
and that's fine.

535
00:40:23,638 --> 00:40:25,296
But if you don't want to do it

536
00:40:25,379 --> 00:40:28,426
how about you stop bitching to
me about the damn phone bill!

537
00:41:12,382 --> 00:41:15,690
Douglas?
Jim, and Christy.

538
00:42:33,986 --> 00:42:36,205
You to the corner!

539
00:42:36,684 --> 00:42:42,346
Five! Six! Seven!
Eight! Nine! Ten!

540
00:42:42,429 --> 00:42:44,431
Yeah!

541
00:42:46,302 --> 00:42:48,217
Yeah!

542
00:42:56,008 --> 00:42:58,358
Man, she didn't
stand a fucking chance.

543
00:42:59,664 --> 00:43:01,535
Bam!
She went down.

544
00:43:02,144 --> 00:43:03,236
You did great.

545
00:43:03,319 --> 00:43:05,195
Right, here.

546
00:43:05,278 --> 00:43:08,938
Christy! I want you to meet
an old friend of mine.

547
00:43:09,021 --> 00:43:10,853
Jessie Robinson.

548
00:43:10,936 --> 00:43:14,069
Christy. It's a pleasure
to meet you.

549
00:43:14,679 --> 00:43:17,725
I mean, that was
one hell of a show.

550
00:43:18,291 --> 00:43:19,597
Hey.

551
00:43:20,641 --> 00:43:22,034
Jim Martin.

552
00:43:22,774 --> 00:43:24,519
-Nice to meet you.
-Yeah, likewise.

553
00:43:24,602 --> 00:43:25,520
-Oh yeah?
-Yeah.

554
00:43:25,603 --> 00:43:27,126
We gotta get her out of here.

555
00:43:27,735 --> 00:43:29,128
She needs to meet Don.

556
00:43:29,476 --> 00:43:30,873
Well, yeah...

557
00:43:30,956 --> 00:43:32,663
Want to pop outside
and have a chat?

558
00:43:33,045 --> 00:43:34,267
Shit.

559
00:43:34,350 --> 00:43:35,965
Fuck, why didn't
you check the oil?

560
00:43:36,048 --> 00:43:37,575
Why didn't you check the oil?

561
00:43:37,658 --> 00:43:39,490
'Cause it's your job,
you're a man,

562
00:43:39,573 --> 00:43:41,666
and men are supposed to
check the goddamn oil.

563
00:43:41,749 --> 00:43:43,929
-I gotta pull over.
-No, we can't be late.

564
00:43:44,012 --> 00:43:45,714
Do you wanna blow a head gasket?

565
00:43:45,797 --> 00:43:46,976
I don't give a fuck what we blow

566
00:43:47,059 --> 00:43:49,108
as long as it's not
this goddamn meeting!

567
00:43:49,191 --> 00:43:51,019
We're gonna go meet Don King!

568
00:43:51,324 --> 00:43:53,591
We're gonna go meet
Don fuckin' King!

569
00:43:53,674 --> 00:43:54,984
Fuck!

570
00:43:55,067 --> 00:43:57,377
Ho!

571
00:43:57,460 --> 00:43:59,858
-Here he is!
-Hey, Don.

572
00:43:59,941 --> 00:44:02,291
Alright, alright!

573
00:44:03,292 --> 00:44:04,341
Good to see you, Don.

574
00:44:04,424 --> 00:44:06,343
-You know Jim Martin.
-Nope.

575
00:44:06,426 --> 00:44:08,606
-I thought you two met.
-Nope.

576
00:44:08,689 --> 00:44:11,779
-Yeah, we met back in Detroit.
-Nope.

577
00:44:14,216 --> 00:44:15,308
There were a lot of
people around...

578
00:44:15,391 --> 00:44:17,567
Nope. I don't forget people.

579
00:44:18,438 --> 00:44:21,488
So, you're the trainer
and the husband?

580
00:44:21,571 --> 00:44:24,009
-Yes, sir.
-I like that.

581
00:44:24,966 --> 00:44:28,800
And you must be the lady I've
been hearing so much about.

582
00:44:28,883 --> 00:44:30,976
Christy.
How old are you?

583
00:44:31,059 --> 00:44:32,238
I'm twenty-four, sir.

584
00:44:32,321 --> 00:44:33,975
You're pretty.

585
00:44:34,454 --> 00:44:36,025
And you're really a fighter?

586
00:44:36,108 --> 00:44:39,158
Yes, sir. It's an honor
to meet you, Mr. King.

587
00:44:39,241 --> 00:44:40,725
Well, tell me about yourself.

588
00:44:40,808 --> 00:44:43,946
Jessie here says that
you fight in all pink.

589
00:44:44,029 --> 00:44:46,209
That's good. I like pink.

590
00:44:46,292 --> 00:44:47,776
Well I'm from West Virginia.

591
00:44:47,859 --> 00:44:50,339
What's that got to do with pink?

592
00:44:51,427 --> 00:44:53,477
Nothing, sir. I'm just
telling you about myself.

593
00:44:53,560 --> 00:44:55,170
Pink was my idea.

594
00:44:57,477 --> 00:45:02,138
West Virginia.
Coal-mining country.

595
00:45:02,221 --> 00:45:04,923
Yes, sir. My daddy and my
brother work the mines.

596
00:45:05,006 --> 00:45:07,104
So why in the hell are
you fighting Christy?

597
00:45:07,269 --> 00:45:08,666
What's a pretty girl
like you doing

598
00:45:08,749 --> 00:45:11,103
getting punched in the face
for a living?

599
00:45:11,186 --> 00:45:13,018
I'm good at it, sir.

600
00:45:13,101 --> 00:45:16,028
And I figured you could help me
with the making a living bit.

601
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:23,812
Okay, I like you.
I wanna see what you got.

602
00:45:23,895 --> 00:45:27,812
I have never had a
lady fighter in my office.

603
00:45:28,464 --> 00:45:31,036
-Jessie says you have a tape.
-Yes, sir.

604
00:45:31,119 --> 00:45:32,207
Bonnie!

605
00:45:34,166 --> 00:45:36,690
Put Christy's tape
in the machine.

606
00:46:02,020 --> 00:46:03,547
Is it on the right channel?

607
00:46:03,630 --> 00:46:05,066
I think so.

608
00:46:05,850 --> 00:46:07,594
I can hear it spinning in there.

609
00:46:07,677 --> 00:46:09,462
Is it connected to the TV?

610
00:46:10,506 --> 00:46:12,991
Damn. Oh well,
just leave it there.

611
00:46:13,074 --> 00:46:15,729
-I'll look at it later.
-No!

612
00:46:17,687 --> 00:46:19,515
Wait, no. Ah...

613
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:32,441
Ooh!

614
00:46:33,878 --> 00:46:35,361
Show him your left hook, baby.

615
00:46:35,444 --> 00:46:37,184
Left hook.

616
00:46:39,013 --> 00:46:41,716
Okay, Christy, okay.
Okay, Christy.

617
00:46:41,799 --> 00:46:43,195
You look good.

618
00:46:43,278 --> 00:46:47,069
A coal miner's daughter
who fights in pink trunks

619
00:46:47,152 --> 00:46:49,462
and sleeps with her corner man.

620
00:46:49,545 --> 00:46:50,763
I love it.

621
00:46:51,852 --> 00:46:53,597
Fuck it.
Sign her up.

622
00:46:53,680 --> 00:46:55,120
Let's do it.

623
00:46:55,203 --> 00:46:57,775
Bonnie, have Dana
draw up a contract.

624
00:46:57,858 --> 00:47:01,079
Five six-round fights
at five thousand a fight.

625
00:47:02,210 --> 00:47:05,043
Honey, I'm gonna throw
you in there.

626
00:47:05,126 --> 00:47:06,566
Sink or swim.

627
00:47:06,649 --> 00:47:10,570
But what I need
from you - fight good,

628
00:47:10,653 --> 00:47:14,444
and make sure everybody's
saying your name.

629
00:47:14,527 --> 00:47:16,315
You hear me?

630
00:47:16,398 --> 00:47:18,444
Yes, sir.

631
00:47:18,966 --> 00:47:21,320
-Thank you, Mr. King.
-Yeah.

632
00:47:21,403 --> 00:47:22,713
Thank you, Don.

633
00:47:22,796 --> 00:47:24,367
We'll take that contract,
show it to our lawyer

634
00:47:24,450 --> 00:47:25,865
and get it right back to you.

635
00:47:27,018 --> 00:47:30,935
-Your name is Jim.
-Yes, sir.

636
00:47:32,197 --> 00:47:34,808
How much did she
make on her last fight?

637
00:47:37,028 --> 00:47:38,420
Four hundred dollars.

638
00:47:39,857 --> 00:47:42,341
That contract don't
leave this office.

639
00:47:42,424 --> 00:47:46,037
You sign it here,
or you don't sign it at all.

640
00:47:49,083 --> 00:47:52,652
Only in America, baby.
Only in America.

641
00:48:08,624 --> 00:48:09,978
Oh boy, ladies and gentlemen,

642
00:48:10,061 --> 00:48:11,932
have I got a treat for you.

643
00:48:12,454 --> 00:48:17,546
I want to introduce to you
the first lady of boxing.

644
00:48:18,069 --> 00:48:24,122
A new and dynamic and
beautiful boxing sensation.

645
00:48:24,205 --> 00:48:29,994
The Coal Miner's Daughter -
Christy Martin!

646
00:48:31,647 --> 00:48:33,127
Y'all give it up now.

647
00:48:33,998 --> 00:48:35,177
Give it up everybody.

648
00:48:35,260 --> 00:48:37,614
Y'all keep your hands going now.

649
00:48:37,697 --> 00:48:39,655
Come on up here, baby.

650
00:48:44,269 --> 00:48:47,141
-Thank you, Mr. King.
-Yes.

651
00:48:48,012 --> 00:48:51,106
I want to thank you
for this opportunity

652
00:48:51,189 --> 00:48:52,368
and say what an honor it is

653
00:48:52,451 --> 00:48:54,627
to be fighting on a
Mike Tyson under card.

654
00:48:55,149 --> 00:48:57,238
I can hardly believe it.

655
00:48:57,978 --> 00:49:01,290
And to be the first woman fight
on pay-per-view -

656
00:49:01,373 --> 00:49:04,985
I don't think I could have ever
dreamed I'd be here.

657
00:49:10,077 --> 00:49:11,731
But here I am.

658
00:49:12,166 --> 00:49:13,215
And can I just say,

659
00:49:13,298 --> 00:49:14,520
I don't expect people
to be tuning in

660
00:49:14,603 --> 00:49:16,779
because I'm the first
woman or whatever.

661
00:49:17,302 --> 00:49:21,963
Everyone should watch because
I'm the best and I can fight.

662
00:49:22,046 --> 00:49:23,616
And I'm going to prove that
Saturday night

663
00:49:23,699 --> 00:49:26,228
when I stop Deirdre Gogarty
in such spectacular fashion

664
00:49:26,311 --> 00:49:27,751
that every motherfucker
in that arena

665
00:49:27,834 --> 00:49:29,395
is going to be talking about it.

666
00:49:30,184 --> 00:49:31,711
So get ready, honey,

667
00:49:31,794 --> 00:49:34,477
'cause Christy Martin's going
to knock you the fuck out.

668
00:49:37,757 --> 00:49:39,933
Christy Martin, everybody!

669
00:49:48,420 --> 00:49:49,682
Stay still.

670
00:50:02,434 --> 00:50:07,308
Ho! There she is!
The Coal Miner's Daughter.

671
00:50:08,875 --> 00:50:12,448
The whole coal mining family.

672
00:50:12,531 --> 00:50:13,928
You must be the coal miner.

673
00:50:14,011 --> 00:50:15,795
Yeah, that's right.

674
00:50:19,973 --> 00:50:21,192
How you feeling, baby?

675
00:50:22,410 --> 00:50:24,412
-I feel okay.
-I hope so.

676
00:50:24,934 --> 00:50:26,549
Make this a good fight.

677
00:50:26,632 --> 00:50:29,765
Please don't let me down.
Make this a real good fight.

678
00:50:30,157 --> 00:50:32,072
I'm sticking my dick out
on this one.

679
00:50:32,812 --> 00:50:35,645
I will.
Thank you, Mr. King.

680
00:50:35,728 --> 00:50:37,295
Okay.

681
00:50:38,905 --> 00:50:40,606
Stay still.

682
00:50:40,689 --> 00:50:42,822
-Hey, be still.
-I'm trying.

683
00:51:06,889 --> 00:51:10,415
Oh! It's freezing.

684
00:51:10,893 --> 00:51:12,508
I thought the desert
was supposed to be hot.

685
00:51:12,591 --> 00:51:14,549
I didn't bring a coat with me.

686
00:51:16,377 --> 00:51:18,597
Hey, let's go shopping tomorrow.

687
00:51:19,250 --> 00:51:21,430
I can't think about that
right now, Mama.

688
00:51:21,513 --> 00:51:23,432
Can't think about what
right now?

689
00:51:23,515 --> 00:51:24,607
Joyce?

690
00:51:24,690 --> 00:51:26,130
Let her be.

691
00:51:26,213 --> 00:51:27,740
What am I doing?

692
00:51:27,823 --> 00:51:29,481
I'm talking to my daughter.

693
00:51:29,564 --> 00:51:31,309
I never see her anymore.

694
00:51:31,392 --> 00:51:33,177
Goddammit!

695
00:51:35,701 --> 00:51:37,968
Okay, everybody out.

696
00:51:38,051 --> 00:51:39,752
Let's go get our seats, huh?

697
00:51:39,835 --> 00:51:41,402
Let's go.

698
00:51:49,149 --> 00:51:51,025
I'm so fucking nervous.

699
00:51:51,108 --> 00:51:53,201
I can't get my hands
to stop shaking.

700
00:51:53,284 --> 00:51:55,116
Hey, you're okay.
You're fine.

701
00:51:55,199 --> 00:51:57,596
You just treat it
like any other fight.

702
00:51:57,679 --> 00:51:59,294
I can't.
This is huge.

703
00:51:59,377 --> 00:52:01,513
Just do what you do, baby.

704
00:52:01,596 --> 00:52:03,424
You've done the work.

705
00:52:03,990 --> 00:52:06,688
Bring that action.
Okay?

706
00:52:08,690 --> 00:52:10,214
You're a star.

707
00:52:15,915 --> 00:52:17,743
You bring that action.

708
00:52:40,766 --> 00:52:42,772
Introducing to you first,

709
00:52:42,855 --> 00:52:45,949
on my left - fighting out
of the blue corner -

710
00:52:46,032 --> 00:52:48,343
joining us from Dublin, Ireland,

711
00:52:48,426 --> 00:52:53,826
at 130 pounds with a record
of ten wins and three losses,

712
00:52:53,909 --> 00:52:58,657
two draws, nine wins
coming by way of knockout

713
00:52:58,740 --> 00:53:04,964
introducing the hard-hitting
Deidre Gogarty!

714
00:53:07,749 --> 00:53:09,320
And her opponent -

715
00:53:09,403 --> 00:53:11,496
fighting out of the red corner -

716
00:53:11,579 --> 00:53:13,237
she weighed in at the
lightweight limit

717
00:53:13,320 --> 00:53:15,935
of 135 pounds even,

718
00:53:16,018 --> 00:53:19,417
coming to you by way of
Mullens, West Virginia

719
00:53:19,500 --> 00:53:23,987
with a record of 34 wins,
two losses and two draws,

720
00:53:24,070 --> 00:53:28,252
she has 25 wins
by way of knockout -

721
00:53:28,335 --> 00:53:34,863
introducing The Coal Miner's
Daughter - Christy Martin!

722
00:53:47,049 --> 00:53:49,055
-Come on!
-Come on, Christy!

723
00:53:49,138 --> 00:53:50,443
Come on!

724
00:53:58,931 --> 00:54:00,628
Come on, sweet pea!

725
00:54:17,558 --> 00:54:18,777
Ten seconds.

726
00:54:29,440 --> 00:54:30,919
Whoo!

727
00:54:33,792 --> 00:54:38,409
Four! Five!
Six! Seven! Eight!

728
00:54:38,492 --> 00:54:39,928
Whoo!

729
00:54:43,758 --> 00:54:45,107
Step.

730
00:55:01,776 --> 00:55:02,868
Yeah!

731
00:55:02,951 --> 00:55:04,866
Keep going!
Come on!

732
00:55:36,376 --> 00:55:38,073
Break!
Break, break!

733
00:55:55,613 --> 00:55:58,311
You're doing good,
but you gotta use that jab more.

734
00:56:00,618 --> 00:56:02,232
She keeps going backwards.

735
00:56:02,315 --> 00:56:04,926
Well, use that jab. Throw
that right hand behind it.

736
00:56:05,274 --> 00:56:06,628
How's that nose?

737
00:56:06,711 --> 00:56:08,930
I'm fine, Doc.
I'm really fine.

738
00:56:49,884 --> 00:56:52,626
That's it!

739
00:57:14,039 --> 00:57:18,700
After six rounds of boxing
we go to the judges' scorecards

740
00:57:18,783 --> 00:57:21,873
where we have a
unanimous decision.

741
00:57:22,177 --> 00:57:25,446
The judges scored the bout
60-54,

742
00:57:25,529 --> 00:57:29,667
59-54 and 60-53,

743
00:57:29,750 --> 00:57:32,627
all three in favor
of the winner,

744
00:57:32,710 --> 00:57:37,192
The Coal Miner's Daughter -
Christy Martin!

745
00:57:43,068 --> 00:57:45,549
The Coal Miner's Daughter -

746
00:57:47,551 --> 00:57:50,770
Christy Martin!

747
00:57:54,079 --> 00:57:55,606
Maybe after this, Christy,

748
00:57:55,689 --> 00:57:56,868
we could get you in your kitchen

749
00:57:56,951 --> 00:57:59,001
cooking breakfast or
something like that.

750
00:57:59,084 --> 00:58:02,221
Boxer by night, housewife by
day - sort of thing, you know.

751
00:58:02,304 --> 00:58:04,093
But don't worry,
it'll be fun and playful.

752
00:58:04,176 --> 00:58:05,355
Oh, we get it.

753
00:58:05,438 --> 00:58:06,661
Yeah, we've done a bunch
of this stuff.

754
00:58:06,744 --> 00:58:10,269
She just did Jay Leno and
Good Morning America.

755
00:58:10,791 --> 00:58:12,489
Oh, that's great.

756
00:58:12,924 --> 00:58:14,712
So, Christy,

757
00:58:14,795 --> 00:58:17,236
they are calling your fight
with Deirdre Gogarty,

758
00:58:17,319 --> 00:58:21,153
"the most lucrative bloody
nose in boxing history".

759
00:58:21,236 --> 00:58:22,677
You're the first woman boxer

760
00:58:22,760 --> 00:58:25,201
to ever appear on the cover
of Sports Illustrated.

761
00:58:25,284 --> 00:58:27,203
You have been called
the fighter that's

762
00:58:27,286 --> 00:58:28,987
put women's boxing on the map.

763
00:58:29,070 --> 00:58:31,163
And yet you are on record saying

764
00:58:31,246 --> 00:58:32,643
that you're not really
interested

765
00:58:32,726 --> 00:58:34,210
in being a champion
for women in sport?

766
00:58:34,293 --> 00:58:35,907
I don't see that
as part of my job.

767
00:58:35,990 --> 00:58:38,867
I'm not here to give some kind
of leg up to other women.

768
00:58:38,950 --> 00:58:40,695
I'm here for one thing,
and that's Christy Martin.

769
00:58:40,778 --> 00:58:43,393
I want to be recognized
as a great fighter, period.

770
00:58:43,476 --> 00:58:45,308
Christy's a regular wife, actually.

771
00:58:45,391 --> 00:58:47,528
She's very ladylike herself.

772
00:58:47,611 --> 00:58:48,833
I mean, she cooks,
she cleans, all that,

773
00:58:48,916 --> 00:58:50,661
but she ain't no feminist.

774
00:58:50,744 --> 00:58:52,184
I'm just a regular wife

775
00:58:52,267 --> 00:58:54,413
who happens to knock
people out for a living.

776
00:59:18,685 --> 00:59:20,557
Good.

777
00:59:47,148 --> 00:59:48,632
Christy!

778
00:59:48,715 --> 00:59:51,461
Meet your new cut man, Miguel.

779
00:59:51,544 --> 00:59:52,984
I hear you're the best.

780
00:59:53,067 --> 00:59:54,812
I'm not so bad.

781
00:59:54,895 --> 00:59:56,901
Well, I got a nose that
loves to bleed.

782
00:59:56,984 --> 00:59:59,556
I could have stopped it
in the Gogarty fight.

783
00:59:59,639 --> 01:00:01,384
Good thing you weren't
in my corner, then.

784
01:00:01,467 --> 01:00:03,429
That nose is making me
a lot of money.

785
01:00:03,512 --> 01:00:04,387
That bitch is fighting dirty.

786
01:00:04,470 --> 01:00:05,867
She's using her fucking head.

787
01:00:05,950 --> 01:00:08,389
You don't put up with that.
You put her on her ass.

788
01:00:21,661 --> 01:00:23,271
Get back.
Back to your corner.

789
01:00:26,623 --> 01:00:30,674
I just wanna say Lisa Holewyne,
you're looking real nice.

790
01:00:30,757 --> 01:00:33,068
This is the first time
I've seen you in a nice dress

791
01:00:33,151 --> 01:00:34,761
looking like a woman.

792
01:00:36,154 --> 01:00:38,639
But when I'm done with you,
you're gonna be so ugly

793
01:00:38,722 --> 01:00:41,210
that not even your girlfriend's
gonna recognize you.

794
01:00:45,859 --> 01:00:47,343
Okay ladies,
we went over the rules

795
01:00:47,426 --> 01:00:48,736
in the dressing rooms.

796
01:00:48,819 --> 01:00:50,172
I want you to protect
yourself at all times

797
01:00:50,255 --> 01:00:52,060
and keep the fight clean
at all times.

798
01:00:52,257 --> 01:00:53,475
Touch gloves.

799
01:00:54,085 --> 01:00:55,133
Good luck.

800
01:00:55,216 --> 01:00:57,915
Good luck getting
knocked the fuck out.

801
01:01:05,966 --> 01:01:07,102
There it is!

802
01:01:07,185 --> 01:01:08,534
Stick and move!

803
01:01:13,147 --> 01:01:19,806
The winner, the Coal Miner's
Daughter - Christy Martin!

804
01:01:21,895 --> 01:01:24,811
Hi Mom, hi Dad, I love you!

805
01:01:25,290 --> 01:01:26,730
Well, if you ask me

806
01:01:26,813 --> 01:01:28,819
I'm the best thing that's ever
happened to women's boxing.

807
01:01:28,902 --> 01:01:30,734
I've done more for the sport
than anyone else, and frankly,

808
01:01:30,817 --> 01:01:31,953
I'm not getting
paid enough for it.

809
01:01:32,036 --> 01:01:33,607
So, you'd like to see
women boxers

810
01:01:33,690 --> 01:01:36,000
get paid more for their efforts?

811
01:01:36,083 --> 01:01:39,130
Well, I don't know about other
women, but I definitely should.

812
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:41,702
Don King, if you're watching

813
01:01:41,785 --> 01:01:44,396
I think pretty little Christy
here wants a raise.

814
01:01:45,614 --> 01:01:47,094
And, we're out.

815
01:01:49,836 --> 01:01:52,317
Love your work, Christy!

816
01:01:55,842 --> 01:01:57,626
-Hey.
-Hi.

817
01:02:16,210 --> 01:02:18,996
Nope, no, it has to be
five or five-thirty.

818
01:02:19,779 --> 01:02:23,000
-Hey, Big Jeff.
-Hey, champ.

819
01:02:25,524 --> 01:02:27,178
Yeah, that works.

820
01:02:38,667 --> 01:02:40,626
What are you doing?
Where's Shortdog?

821
01:02:41,279 --> 01:02:42,850
I sent him home.

822
01:02:42,933 --> 01:02:44,761
I'm gonna spar with you today.

823
01:02:46,763 --> 01:02:48,958
Are you still pissed at me
about this morning?

824
01:02:49,809 --> 01:02:51,942
No.
Get changed.

825
01:02:58,296 --> 01:02:59,823
I'm sorry, what...

826
01:02:59,906 --> 01:03:02,043
He's our neighbor.
What am I supposed to do?

827
01:03:02,126 --> 01:03:04,693
He was being polite,
I was being polite back.

828
01:03:05,433 --> 01:03:06,783
Get ready.

829
01:03:22,233 --> 01:03:24,282
Have you heard from Don yet?

830
01:03:24,365 --> 01:03:26,328
Yeah, I'll handle it.

831
01:03:26,411 --> 01:03:27,590
I know you're handling it,

832
01:03:27,673 --> 01:03:29,635
I just want to know
if you heard anything.

833
01:03:29,718 --> 01:03:31,202
I'm in the deep freeze
over here.

834
01:03:31,285 --> 01:03:33,291
I just want to know when this
contract's gonna get done.

835
01:03:33,374 --> 01:03:35,202
-Yeah I'll get it done.
-When?

836
01:03:35,594 --> 01:03:38,166
If you screwed us by making me
say that dumb shit on TV

837
01:03:38,249 --> 01:03:39,167
about wanting more money.

838
01:03:39,250 --> 01:03:40,338
Yeah, what?

839
01:03:40,904 --> 01:03:42,692
I wanna fight.

840
01:03:42,775 --> 01:03:44,559
I need a contract.

841
01:03:45,822 --> 01:03:47,693
Alright, come on.

842
01:03:53,873 --> 01:03:55,096
When was the last time
you called him?

843
01:03:55,179 --> 01:03:56,789
Keep your hands up.

844
01:03:59,923 --> 01:04:01,755
-Have you even tried him?
-Keep your hands up.

845
01:04:01,838 --> 01:04:03,626
You gotta call his office
every few hours

846
01:04:03,709 --> 01:04:04,928
just to check in...

847
01:04:08,496 --> 01:04:10,198
I told you to keep
your hands up.

848
01:04:10,281 --> 01:04:12,983
-What happened?
-Oh, she...

849
01:04:13,066 --> 01:04:14,724
She just ran right
into my punch.

850
01:04:14,807 --> 01:04:15,856
-She wasn't concentrating.
-Let me see.

851
01:04:15,939 --> 01:04:16,987
Let me see.

852
01:04:17,070 --> 01:04:18,336
Baby, you just
ran right into it.

853
01:04:18,419 --> 01:04:20,251
You know you're not good
at moving your head.

854
01:04:20,334 --> 01:04:21,426
You okay?

855
01:04:21,509 --> 01:04:22,688
She's not that good
at moving her head.

856
01:04:22,771 --> 01:04:24,295
We gotta work on that.

857
01:04:32,303 --> 01:04:33,699
Alright.

858
01:04:33,782 --> 01:04:35,915
Let's get you out of here.
Come on.

859
01:04:36,655 --> 01:04:41,185
On June 28th, in the year
of Our Lord 1997,

860
01:04:41,268 --> 01:04:46,012
Tyson's gonna fight Evander
Holyfield at the MGM Grand.

861
01:04:47,971 --> 01:04:51,235
I'm putting you on the card
against Andrea DeShong.

862
01:04:52,497 --> 01:04:55,547
Thank you, DK.
I promise it'll be a good fight.

863
01:04:55,630 --> 01:04:57,154
I mean, I'll mess her up.

864
01:04:57,676 --> 01:04:59,116
That dyke bitch is crazy.

865
01:04:59,199 --> 01:05:00,509
She fucking hates me
for some reason.

866
01:05:00,592 --> 01:05:03,421
Ha!
For some reason!

867
01:05:06,946 --> 01:05:08,212
I like you, Christy.

868
01:05:08,295 --> 01:05:10,907
You got some real personality.

869
01:05:13,518 --> 01:05:16,568
But if I ever hear you
talking smack about me

870
01:05:16,651 --> 01:05:18,048
to the press again.

871
01:05:18,131 --> 01:05:21,660
Bitching about your
purses being too small

872
01:05:21,743 --> 01:05:23,528
or whatever else -

873
01:05:24,268 --> 01:05:26,661
there ain't gonna be
no more fights.

874
01:05:27,575 --> 01:05:28,707
Do you hear me?

875
01:05:30,796 --> 01:05:32,232
Yes, sir.

876
01:05:43,069 --> 01:05:45,728
Now, I know you gonna
beat DeShong, baby.

877
01:05:45,811 --> 01:05:47,512
That's what you do.

878
01:05:47,595 --> 01:05:49,123
You're the queen right now.

879
01:05:49,206 --> 01:05:51,081
Ain't that right?

880
01:05:51,164 --> 01:05:54,341
You think you what makes
the world turn.

881
01:05:54,951 --> 01:05:57,261
But one day you
gonna wake up and realize

882
01:05:57,344 --> 01:06:00,260
that it turns just fine
without you.

883
01:06:00,739 --> 01:06:04,046
And sugar, that morning's
gonna come like...

884
01:06:10,183 --> 01:06:11,449
It has been billed

885
01:06:11,532 --> 01:06:13,974
the greatest fight
in women's boxing history.

886
01:06:14,057 --> 01:06:17,629
Laila Ali, daughter of the
greatest fighter of all time.

887
01:06:17,712 --> 01:06:22,852
Her record speaks for itself -
15 fights, 15 wins.

888
01:06:22,935 --> 01:06:25,420
And Christy Martin,
the 14-year pro

889
01:06:25,503 --> 01:06:28,423
who single-handedly
put her sport on the map,

890
01:06:28,506 --> 01:06:33,384
with 45 victories, 2 defeats,
31 wins by way of knockout.

891
01:06:33,467 --> 01:06:36,039
But does this veteran have
what it takes to beat a fighter

892
01:06:36,122 --> 01:06:39,216
now considered the new face
of women's boxing?

893
01:06:39,299 --> 01:06:43,086
I was the past, I'm the present,
and I'm the future.

894
01:07:36,356 --> 01:07:37,622
You know, I was thinking maybe

895
01:07:37,705 --> 01:07:39,015
we could bring on someone else

896
01:07:39,098 --> 01:07:40,659
to co-train with you
on this one?

897
01:07:43,755 --> 01:07:45,496
Just for a couple of weeks.

898
01:07:48,716 --> 01:07:50,327
Just a co-trainer.

899
01:07:51,197 --> 01:07:53,069
Not a trainer.
You're still my trainer.

900
01:07:56,028 --> 01:07:58,900
I just want someone who can help
take me to the next level.

901
01:08:01,077 --> 01:08:03,735
You think I can't take you
to the next level?

902
01:08:03,818 --> 01:08:05,646
It's not...

903
01:08:06,430 --> 01:08:08,044
It's not that you're not
training me right.

904
01:08:08,127 --> 01:08:10,916
My fault you're not at
the next level?

905
01:08:10,999 --> 01:08:14,311
We just gotta figure out how
I'm gonna beat this girl.

906
01:08:14,394 --> 01:08:16,179
She's younger and
bigger than me.

907
01:08:19,443 --> 01:08:21,188
Do you want me
to call off the fight?

908
01:08:21,271 --> 01:08:23,229
Do I tell 'em to keep
their money?

909
01:08:23,534 --> 01:08:25,144
God...

910
01:08:26,014 --> 01:08:28,191
-Do I tell 'em that?
-Jim.

911
01:08:30,889 --> 01:08:33,239
Jim, I'm not trying to
undermine you.

912
01:08:33,979 --> 01:08:36,373
Christy's not at
the right level.

913
01:08:36,851 --> 01:08:39,945
She doesn't think she can
get to the next level.

914
01:08:40,028 --> 01:08:42,861
I know I can beat her.
I just...

915
01:08:42,944 --> 01:08:44,559
We were all talking yesterday.

916
01:08:44,642 --> 01:08:47,083
We were all thinking that maybe
we could mix up my training

917
01:08:47,166 --> 01:08:48,867
and make sure I'm ready.

918
01:08:48,950 --> 01:08:51,866
We... we all?
Who the fuck is 'we all'?

919
01:08:52,737 --> 01:08:54,569
Big Jeff and Miguel and me.
We were thinking...

920
01:08:54,652 --> 01:08:56,875
So you're sneaking
behind my back at the gym?

921
01:08:56,958 --> 01:08:58,964
You're talking to my guys
at my gym

922
01:08:59,047 --> 01:09:00,792
about how you
should be training?

923
01:09:00,875 --> 01:09:02,747
It's not your gym, it's our gym!

924
01:09:11,190 --> 01:09:13,018
You shit
your pants and blame me?

925
01:09:26,814 --> 01:09:28,037
Come on, take it easy.

926
01:09:28,120 --> 01:09:30,601
Okay! Okay guys,
just take a break.

927
01:09:31,776 --> 01:09:33,647
What's the matter with you?

928
01:09:50,925 --> 01:09:52,844
We gotta fight different.

929
01:09:52,927 --> 01:09:56,017
You can't slug Ali, you're not
gonna beat her that way.

930
01:09:56,366 --> 01:09:58,977
You gotta fight her like
you fought Lisa Holewyne.

931
01:09:59,456 --> 01:10:01,849
We gotta prep like
we prepped for that fight.

932
01:10:02,285 --> 01:10:04,508
You need to spar with
someone better.

933
01:10:04,591 --> 01:10:06,680
Shortdog ain't gonna
get you there.

934
01:10:09,857 --> 01:10:12,208
I'll get Lisa in
to spar with you.

935
01:10:13,339 --> 01:10:16,429
Lisa Holewyne isn't gonna want
anything to do with me.

936
01:10:17,822 --> 01:10:19,519
We'll see about that.

937
01:10:21,956 --> 01:10:23,697
Take five, guys.

938
01:10:31,705 --> 01:10:33,102
See you later, Jeff.
I'm out of here.

939
01:10:33,185 --> 01:10:35,448
Yo, champ. Come in.

940
01:10:36,884 --> 01:10:37,972
What's up?

941
01:10:39,060 --> 01:10:40,540
Have a seat.

942
01:10:46,720 --> 01:10:47,812
How you feeling?

943
01:10:47,895 --> 01:10:49,727
I'm good.

944
01:10:49,810 --> 01:10:51,595
You're training hard.

945
01:10:52,204 --> 01:10:53,911
I've never seen you
train this hard.

946
01:10:54,989 --> 01:10:56,339
Well Laila's...

947
01:10:56,991 --> 01:10:58,689
Laila's no joke.

948
01:11:03,041 --> 01:11:05,217
And how's everything else?

949
01:11:06,653 --> 01:11:08,438
You okay?

950
01:11:11,963 --> 01:11:13,530
Yeah.

951
01:11:18,448 --> 01:11:20,101
I'm just checking in.

952
01:11:20,493 --> 01:11:21,407
That's all.

953
01:11:24,758 --> 01:11:26,673
If you ever need anything...

954
01:11:27,979 --> 01:11:29,415
I'm here.

955
01:11:30,024 --> 01:11:31,374
Anything.

956
01:11:38,119 --> 01:11:39,904
Yeah, I know.

957
01:11:41,340 --> 01:11:42,820
Thanks.

958
01:11:55,485 --> 01:11:58,618
Christy, will show you around.

959
01:11:59,227 --> 01:12:02,535
Why don't you get warmed up
and we'll get to it?

960
01:12:10,587 --> 01:12:12,806
I really didn't expect you
to come.

961
01:12:13,111 --> 01:12:15,291
Yeah, well,
I actually need the money.

962
01:12:15,374 --> 01:12:17,594
We don't all get purses
like yours.

963
01:12:18,072 --> 01:12:20,640
We're paying you?
How much?

964
01:12:21,554 --> 01:12:23,261
Not enough for you
to be an asshole.

965
01:12:33,610 --> 01:12:35,002
Create angles.

966
01:12:42,749 --> 01:12:44,229
Get out of there.

967
01:12:46,231 --> 01:12:48,886
Hey, create angles.

968
01:13:28,360 --> 01:13:30,014
You good?

969
01:13:30,362 --> 01:13:32,408
Yeah, I'm good.

970
01:13:33,321 --> 01:13:34,932
You're good?

971
01:13:36,324 --> 01:13:38,021
Yeah, I'm good.

972
01:14:00,740 --> 01:14:02,655
Find it, please.
Call me back.

973
01:14:16,974 --> 01:14:18,501
How do you think she's looking?

974
01:14:18,584 --> 01:14:19,937
She's looking good.

975
01:14:20,020 --> 01:14:22,200
She's a little chunky, but she
had to come up in weight

976
01:14:22,283 --> 01:14:24,590
so it is what it is, I guess.

977
01:14:25,243 --> 01:14:27,728
You know, Jim, I don't mean to
question her abilities,

978
01:14:27,811 --> 01:14:31,554
but I'm worried
about this fight.

979
01:14:32,337 --> 01:14:35,819
I'm bigger than Christy and
Laila's too big for me.

980
01:14:39,431 --> 01:14:42,521
I bet you wish it was you
going up against Ali.

981
01:14:43,435 --> 01:14:47,138
No. I don't think
I could beat her.

982
01:14:47,221 --> 01:14:50,964
You're right, you couldn't.
Christy can.

983
01:14:51,748 --> 01:14:55,099
She keeps her head right,
and her attitude.

984
01:14:56,796 --> 01:15:01,279
So yeah. Now's probably the
time for you to leave.

985
01:15:04,238 --> 01:15:05,983
When Big Jeff gets back,

986
01:15:06,066 --> 01:15:07,811
he'll take care of whatever
we still owe you.

987
01:15:07,894 --> 01:15:10,418
We really appreciate you
coming out.

988
01:15:16,120 --> 01:15:17,908
You know when we
fought you beat me

989
01:15:17,991 --> 01:15:19,736
because you fought smart.

990
01:15:19,819 --> 01:15:20,994
You know it.

991
01:15:21,560 --> 01:15:24,476
And to beat Laila, you're going
to have to fight smart.

992
01:15:27,958 --> 01:15:29,617
I'm going to peek-a-boo
that bitch.

993
01:15:30,047 --> 01:15:31,139
She's going to think
I'm over here,

994
01:15:31,222 --> 01:15:32,963
but actually I'm over here.

995
01:15:34,399 --> 01:15:36,140
She ain't gonna know where I am.

996
01:15:39,535 --> 01:15:40,405
Okay.

997
01:15:42,320 --> 01:15:43,979
Well, thanks for
having me come in.

998
01:15:44,496 --> 01:15:46,019
It wasn't my idea.

999
01:15:46,716 --> 01:15:49,545
I wanted a new trainer.
I got you instead.

1000
01:15:54,158 --> 01:15:56,943
You know how easy you make it
for people to dislike you?

1001
01:15:59,206 --> 01:16:01,996
It's like all this
tough girl shit.

1002
01:16:02,079 --> 01:16:03,515
Bravado.

1003
01:16:03,907 --> 01:16:06,779
Maybe Jim tells you to do it,
I don't know.

1004
01:16:07,084 --> 01:16:09,434
Maybe it's all part of the show.

1005
01:16:10,783 --> 01:16:14,439
I don't know who's telling you
what, but you don't need it.

1006
01:16:16,136 --> 01:16:17,834
Whatever you say.

1007
01:16:20,576 --> 01:16:22,625
Do you remember
what you said to me

1008
01:16:22,708 --> 01:16:25,624
when I wished you
good luck before our fight?

1009
01:16:27,147 --> 01:16:29,889
Yeah. I remember.

1010
01:16:30,629 --> 01:16:31,678
You were fucking with me.

1011
01:16:31,761 --> 01:16:36,679
No. I was just
wishing you luck.

1012
01:16:57,177 --> 01:17:00,311
Sorry, ma'am.
Restroom's occupied.

1013
01:17:21,724 --> 01:17:24,857
Right on.
Here we go.

1014
01:17:30,254 --> 01:17:32,864
Laila Ali, 162.

1015
01:17:47,924 --> 01:17:49,273
Whenever you're ready.

1016
01:17:55,583 --> 01:17:57,633
Christy Martin, 159.

1017
01:17:57,716 --> 01:17:59,679
Yeah!

1018
01:17:59,762 --> 01:18:00,984
We should have made her
come down more.

1019
01:18:01,067 --> 01:18:03,291
I'm 143.

1020
01:18:03,374 --> 01:18:05,946
By the time she rehydrates,
she's gonna be 170.

1021
01:18:06,029 --> 01:18:08,644
You're nervous. You're always
nervous before fights.

1022
01:18:08,727 --> 01:18:09,689
Get off your legs.

1023
01:18:09,772 --> 01:18:11,821
I should be fighting
Lucia Rijker.

1024
01:18:11,904 --> 01:18:13,083
You know she wants to fight me.

1025
01:18:13,166 --> 01:18:14,084
I mean, that makes sense.

1026
01:18:14,167 --> 01:18:16,652
Rijker is small time.

1027
01:18:16,735 --> 01:18:18,698
You're big time.

1028
01:18:18,781 --> 01:18:20,260
Get off your feet.

1029
01:18:26,527 --> 01:18:28,098
Excuse me, ma'am.

1030
01:18:28,181 --> 01:18:31,315
I just want to let you know that
I'm rooting for you tomorrow.

1031
01:18:32,185 --> 01:18:34,057
I think you can beat her.

1032
01:18:46,243 --> 01:18:48,027
Stay focused.

1033
01:19:07,960 --> 01:19:09,226
Hey, this isn't right.

1034
01:19:09,309 --> 01:19:10,793
She shouldn't be making
Christy wait.

1035
01:19:10,876 --> 01:19:11,751
Well that's the coin toss.

1036
01:19:11,834 --> 01:19:13,404
It's bullshit.

1037
01:19:13,487 --> 01:19:15,015
Well, I don't know what
you want me to say.

1038
01:19:15,098 --> 01:19:16,490
You guys lost the toss.

1039
01:19:17,665 --> 01:19:18,975
Goddammit.

1040
01:19:19,058 --> 01:19:21,238
Ali! Ali! Ali!

1041
01:19:21,321 --> 01:19:23,846
It's all good.
Focus on my hands.

1042
01:19:24,672 --> 01:19:30,113
Ali! Ali! Ali! Ali!
Ali! Ali! Ali! Ali! Ali! Ali!

1043
01:19:33,116 --> 01:19:34,813
Get that up there.

1044
01:20:47,451 --> 01:20:49,192
Alright, Laila.
Come on, Christy.

1045
01:20:55,894 --> 01:20:57,117
Ladies, you both
received instructions

1046
01:20:57,200 --> 01:20:58,248
in the dressing room.

1047
01:20:58,331 --> 01:21:00,120
I told you what I
expected of both of you.

1048
01:21:00,203 --> 01:21:02,122
Don't make me have
no decision in the fighting.

1049
01:21:02,205 --> 01:21:04,381
Touch 'em up,
come out fighting. Let's go.

1050
01:21:22,399 --> 01:21:23,966
Let's go.

1051
01:21:26,533 --> 01:21:28,100
Come on, get in there!

1052
01:21:30,798 --> 01:21:32,061
Come on, get in there!

1053
01:21:44,029 --> 01:21:45,117
Guard up!

1054
01:21:56,694 --> 01:21:58,478
Break up, break up, break up.

1055
01:22:06,530 --> 01:22:08,140
Why are you slugging?

1056
01:22:08,749 --> 01:22:10,447
Am I fighting crooked?

1057
01:22:10,926 --> 01:22:11,756
I'm dizzy.

1058
01:22:11,839 --> 01:22:13,149
No, you're alright.

1059
01:22:13,232 --> 01:22:15,408
Just keep your defense up.
Don't slug at her.

1060
01:22:15,887 --> 01:22:17,236
I'm dizzy.

1061
01:22:19,369 --> 01:22:20,417
I feel like I'm on a slant.

1062
01:22:20,500 --> 01:22:23,329
Don't slug at her.
Enough of that.

1063
01:22:39,258 --> 01:22:42,044
-Let's go, let's go!
-Stay off the ropes!

1064
01:22:49,486 --> 01:22:52,837
Breathe in through the nose -
out through the mouth.

1065
01:22:53,446 --> 01:22:54,708
I'm still dizzy.

1066
01:22:55,187 --> 01:22:56,627
I can't get my balance back.

1067
01:22:56,710 --> 01:22:59,326
Hey. You're alright.

1068
01:22:59,409 --> 01:23:01,894
You're alright.
Just give me one more round.

1069
01:23:01,977 --> 01:23:03,282
Get your composure back.

1070
01:23:04,414 --> 01:23:05,763
Seconds up!

1071
01:23:10,028 --> 01:23:11,551
Break, break.

1072
01:23:23,085 --> 01:23:25,913
Jim, she's not good.
You should throw in the towel.

1073
01:24:31,762 --> 01:24:34,504
Get in close, Shortdog.
Get in close. Get out.

1074
01:24:34,808 --> 01:24:36,989
Move. Move.

1075
01:24:37,072 --> 01:24:38,816
You're short, Shortdog.
Use it. Stay in close.

1076
01:24:38,899 --> 01:24:39,992
Who's the fucking trainer here?

1077
01:24:40,075 --> 01:24:41,428
You keep running
your damn mouth.

1078
01:24:41,511 --> 01:24:43,078
Alright.

1079
01:24:44,688 --> 01:24:45,993
Dig in.

1080
01:24:46,429 --> 01:24:50,872
Jim. I'm done.
I'm not feeling great.

1081
01:24:50,955 --> 01:24:52,565
Two more rounds.

1082
01:24:53,610 --> 01:24:55,525
I'm not feeling it today.

1083
01:25:20,289 --> 01:25:22,117
Two more rounds
on the heavy bag.

1084
01:25:23,030 --> 01:25:24,336
Why?

1085
01:25:25,076 --> 01:25:27,778
-I don't have a fight.
-I'm working on that.

1086
01:25:27,861 --> 01:25:29,258
How?

1087
01:25:29,341 --> 01:25:31,956
Well, I spoke to Bob Arum

1088
01:25:32,039 --> 01:25:35,739
and he said a Lucia Rijker
fight is looking good.

1089
01:25:36,609 --> 01:25:38,002
When?

1090
01:25:38,829 --> 01:25:40,008
Why didn't you tell me?

1091
01:25:40,091 --> 01:25:43,442
I don't have the details.
He's getting into it.

1092
01:25:44,008 --> 01:25:45,662
Just stay ready.

1093
01:26:03,027 --> 01:26:04,550
Have you heard from Bob?

1094
01:26:06,422 --> 01:26:07,601
Bob who?

1095
01:26:07,684 --> 01:26:09,168
Bob Arum.

1096
01:26:09,251 --> 01:26:11,592
Do you know anything more
about the Rijker fight?

1097
01:26:15,431 --> 01:26:17,041
Why is Deana calling you again?

1098
01:26:18,521 --> 01:26:19,917
Because I need a haircut.

1099
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:21,528
She called you yesterday.

1100
01:26:21,611 --> 01:26:23,530
Yeah, well,
I missed her call yesterday.

1101
01:26:23,613 --> 01:26:26,272
How many calls does it take
to organize a haircut?

1102
01:26:26,355 --> 01:26:27,621
It only takes one,

1103
01:26:27,704 --> 01:26:29,057
but you actually have to talk
to the person

1104
01:26:29,140 --> 01:26:30,276
to make the appointment.

1105
01:26:30,359 --> 01:26:31,712
It's like every time
I pick up your phone,

1106
01:26:31,795 --> 01:26:32,843
there's another call from her.

1107
01:26:32,926 --> 01:26:34,193
Okay, so why the fuck
are you looking

1108
01:26:34,276 --> 01:26:35,933
at my phone all the time?
Stop looking at my phone!

1109
01:26:36,016 --> 01:26:38,153
I have to look at your phone. I
need to know what you're doing.

1110
01:26:38,236 --> 01:26:39,720
How else am I going to know
what you're doing?

1111
01:26:39,803 --> 01:26:42,197
I'm getting a damn haircut.
Give me my phone back.

1112
01:26:42,980 --> 01:26:44,377
Why are you getting a haircut?

1113
01:26:44,460 --> 01:26:45,900
Because that's what people do.

1114
01:26:45,983 --> 01:26:47,510
They get fucking haircuts.

1115
01:26:47,593 --> 01:26:48,816
You just had one.

1116
01:26:48,899 --> 01:26:52,515
I had one two months ago.
Then it fuckin' grew.

1117
01:26:52,598 --> 01:26:54,988
Maybe you'd understand
if you had any hair to cut.

1118
01:27:25,805 --> 01:27:26,636
Ha, ha.

1119
01:27:26,719 --> 01:27:27,942
It's the Salters!

1120
01:27:28,025 --> 01:27:30,031
Heya Jim,
where's the birthday girl at?

1121
01:27:30,114 --> 01:27:32,425
Hi, come on.
Good to see you.

1122
01:27:32,508 --> 01:27:34,249
-Hey Jim.
-Come on in.

1123
01:27:35,989 --> 01:27:38,344
Well, Bob thinks
it's a good idea.

1124
01:27:38,427 --> 01:27:41,477
Tie in the fight with the home
video release of the movie -

1125
01:27:41,560 --> 01:27:42,783
a marketing tie in.

1126
01:27:42,866 --> 01:27:44,959
Mm, yeah, Rijker was
involved in that film.

1127
01:27:45,042 --> 01:27:46,961
Yeah.
Get Hillary Swank on board.

1128
01:27:47,044 --> 01:27:48,049
-Huh.
-Yeah.

1129
01:27:48,132 --> 01:27:49,442
-Hilary Swank?
-Yeah.

1130
01:27:49,525 --> 01:27:50,617
-No way.
-Yeah.

1131
01:27:50,700 --> 01:27:52,005
That's awesome, boss.

1132
01:27:56,749 --> 01:27:58,447
Hi.

1133
01:28:03,930 --> 01:28:05,371
Mom, I need to talk to you
about something.

1134
01:28:05,454 --> 01:28:08,413
Well, yeah.
Shoot.

1135
01:28:10,850 --> 01:28:12,374
Can I talk to you in private?

1136
01:28:14,680 --> 01:28:16,508
Will you go out front with me?

1137
01:28:17,553 --> 01:28:19,076
Things aren't right.

1138
01:28:19,772 --> 01:28:22,431
He knows everything I do
or say inside the house.

1139
01:28:22,514 --> 01:28:24,085
He must have the
whole house set up

1140
01:28:24,168 --> 01:28:25,521
with hidden cameras
or something.

1141
01:28:25,604 --> 01:28:27,780
And he's angry at me
all the time.

1142
01:28:28,520 --> 01:28:30,265
What's he angry about?

1143
01:28:30,348 --> 01:28:32,045
Everything.

1144
01:28:35,440 --> 01:28:37,268
And there's other stuff too,
Mom.

1145
01:28:39,531 --> 01:28:41,482
He's making videotapes of us
doing stuff.

1146
01:28:43,013 --> 01:28:44,148
He's scaring me.

1147
01:28:44,231 --> 01:28:46,325
I don't know what
I'm supposed to do.

1148
01:28:46,408 --> 01:28:48,279
I don't want to be here.

1149
01:28:49,236 --> 01:28:51,413
I don't want him
to train me anymore.

1150
01:28:51,848 --> 01:28:53,201
I got this...

1151
01:28:53,284 --> 01:28:55,029
This fight with Lucia Rijker
coming up.

1152
01:28:55,112 --> 01:28:56,465
It's supposed to be
a real payday.

1153
01:28:56,548 --> 01:28:57,553
And I'm gonna need that money.

1154
01:28:57,636 --> 01:28:59,033
Because I gotta get out of here,

1155
01:28:59,116 --> 01:29:00,817
and I don't know what
I'm doing, and I don't...

1156
01:29:00,900 --> 01:29:03,437
I don't even know how
I got in this situation, but...

1157
01:29:05,427 --> 01:29:07,864
I need help, Momma.

1158
01:29:09,300 --> 01:29:10,519
Oh...

1159
01:29:10,997 --> 01:29:13,130
Oh, Christy.

1160
01:29:14,697 --> 01:29:17,134
You sound crazy.

1161
01:29:18,788 --> 01:29:22,661
Jim told me you've been messing
around with some kind of drugs.

1162
01:29:24,054 --> 01:29:26,539
And I can't tell you
how to live your life,

1163
01:29:26,622 --> 01:29:29,320
but you need to
get your act together.

1164
01:29:31,409 --> 01:29:32,588
I'm not comfortable

1165
01:29:32,671 --> 01:29:35,112
having this conversation
behind Jim's back,

1166
01:29:35,195 --> 01:29:37,158
so I'm gonna go back in there

1167
01:29:37,241 --> 01:29:40,113
and you pull yourself together
before we do the cake.

1168
01:29:41,985 --> 01:29:44,165
I drove a long way
to be here for this.

1169
01:29:44,248 --> 01:29:45,770
I know, Momma.

1170

Yeah, I'm good.

1183
01:31:40,843 --> 01:31:41,891
Are you sure?

1184
01:31:41,974 --> 01:31:43,672
What do you need to tell me?

1185
01:31:47,589 --> 01:31:48,938
Jeff?

1186
01:31:49,939 --> 01:31:52,071
Honey, you are like
family to me.

1187
01:31:52,898 --> 01:31:54,426
And you know I don't like
getting involved

1188
01:31:54,509 --> 01:31:56,119
in other people's
business but...

1189
01:31:57,120 --> 01:31:58,904
I am worried about you.

1190
01:32:00,602 --> 01:32:02,255
I've heard some stuff.

1191
01:32:03,692 --> 01:32:05,084
What stuff?

1192
01:32:07,434 --> 01:32:08,523
Jeff, what stuff?

1193
01:32:09,306 --> 01:32:12,831
Jim has been skimming
money off of your fights.

1194
01:32:13,702 --> 01:32:17,405
He's been hiding the money
in a tin can in your backyard

1195
01:32:17,488 --> 01:32:20,491
and sending Marcel to go get it
while you're at the gym.

1196
01:32:21,492 --> 01:32:24,194
I think he's giving it to his
ex-wife or his kids.

1197
01:32:24,277 --> 01:32:26,618
I don't know what else
he would be doing with it.

1198
01:32:28,543 --> 01:32:30,545
And there's other things, too.

1199
01:32:32,198 --> 01:32:33,635
Videotapes.

1200
01:32:34,331 --> 01:32:35,680
Of you.

1201
01:32:39,510 --> 01:32:40,816
You know.

1202
01:32:42,426 --> 01:32:44,167
I think you need to be
very careful.

1203
01:32:46,865 --> 01:32:48,867
How do you know about this?

1204
01:32:49,738 --> 01:32:51,696
The young guys at the gym...

1205
01:32:53,393 --> 01:32:55,526
They were saying some
things about it.

1206
01:33:05,144 --> 01:33:07,368
I was hoping you were going to
say that he's having an affair

1207
01:33:07,451 --> 01:33:09,018
and wants to leave me.

1208
01:33:10,106 --> 01:33:11,760
Sorry.

1209
01:33:12,804 --> 01:33:14,763
I didn't know what to do.

1210
01:33:21,160 --> 01:33:24,250
I gotta keep this Rijker purse
away from him, somehow.

1211
01:33:25,295 --> 01:33:27,253
How do I do that?
I need that money.

1212
01:33:28,298 --> 01:33:31,083
Champ... that fight
ain't happening.

1213
01:33:32,911 --> 01:33:34,917
I don't know why he
keeps telling you it's on,

1214
01:33:35,000 --> 01:33:36,480
but it's not.

1215
01:33:46,925 --> 01:33:48,971
Ahh!

1216
01:34:02,854 --> 01:34:06,031
You piece of shit!
You motherfucker!

1217
01:34:06,902 --> 01:34:08,516
You piece of shit!

1218
01:34:08,599 --> 01:34:11,080
I bled for that money,
you piece of shit!

1219
01:34:11,558 --> 01:34:12,734
It's not yours!

1220
01:34:16,868 --> 01:34:19,701
Calm down!
You're embarrassing yourself.

1221
01:34:19,784 --> 01:34:21,616
I'm leaving you.

1222
01:34:21,699 --> 01:34:25,572
No, you are not.
You are not leaving me.

1223
01:34:29,707 --> 01:34:32,144
There is no Christy Martin
without me.

1224
01:34:35,844 --> 01:34:38,411
You'd think you'd be a
little bit more grateful.

1225
01:35:06,613 --> 01:35:08,093
Where you been?

1226
01:35:10,748 --> 01:35:13,925
I thought maybe I'd order
us some ribs for dinner.

1227
01:35:24,327 --> 01:35:25,763
What are you doing?

1228
01:35:26,416 --> 01:35:29,205
Hold up, Christy.
Hold on.

1229
01:35:29,288 --> 01:35:31,943
We gotta talk. Christy?

1230
01:35:33,989 --> 01:35:35,647
Look at me.
Unpack that bag.

1231
01:35:35,730 --> 01:35:38,384
Unpack that bag.
Look at me.

1232
01:35:39,168 --> 01:35:41,561
Christy, look at me.

1233
01:35:43,172 --> 01:35:46,048
All the sacrifices
I've made for you.

1234
01:35:46,131 --> 01:35:48,003
Where are you going?

1235
01:35:48,873 --> 01:35:50,570
If you leave me, I'll kill you.

1236
01:35:51,658 --> 01:35:53,486
You do what you have to do.

1237
01:36:33,178 --> 01:36:34,919
Glad you called.

1238
01:36:35,267 --> 01:36:37,835
I've been following your career.

1239
01:36:38,488 --> 01:36:40,882
It's amazing what you've done.

1240
01:36:42,013 --> 01:36:43,232
Thanks.

1241
01:36:44,624 --> 01:36:47,240
Is everything okay at home?

1242
01:36:47,323 --> 01:36:49,198
You sounded kind of edgy
on the phone.

1243
01:36:49,281 --> 01:36:51,414
You're still with Jim, right?

1244
01:36:54,243 --> 01:36:55,679
I'm gonna leave him.

1245
01:36:56,898 --> 01:36:58,203
Really?

1246
01:36:58,638 --> 01:37:00,771
-Hmm.
-Yeah.

1247
01:37:05,515 --> 01:37:07,808
You know, I haven't talked
to anyone about this.

1248
01:37:09,084 --> 01:37:11,035
I don't really have
anyone I can talk to.

1249
01:37:12,130 --> 01:37:13,696
What's going on?

1250
01:37:24,926 --> 01:37:26,449
I don't know...

1251
01:37:27,667 --> 01:37:29,499
I don't know. I don't even know
where to start.

1252
01:37:29,582 --> 01:37:31,582
I mean, I should have
done this years ago.

1253
01:37:32,281 --> 01:37:33,542
What's going on?

1254
01:37:40,463 --> 01:37:41,681
Is that him?

1255
01:37:44,119 --> 01:37:45,990
Do you need to answer it?

1256
01:37:50,952 --> 01:37:52,518
What?

1257
01:37:52,997 --> 01:37:55,304
I see the way you greeted her.

1258
01:37:57,306 --> 01:37:59,047
What do you think you're doing?

1259
01:38:02,224 --> 01:38:04,835
I'm so close I could touch you.

1260
01:38:11,363 --> 01:38:12,887
What's going on?

1261
01:38:14,497 --> 01:38:17,413
He's here. He's watching us.

1262
01:38:20,024 --> 01:38:21,638
What do you mean?

1263
01:38:21,721 --> 01:38:23,031
What's he gonna do?

1264
01:38:23,114 --> 01:38:25,116
He's not gonna do
anything to you.

1265
01:38:26,422 --> 01:38:27,510
But we should go.

1266
01:38:28,250 --> 01:38:31,688
-I booked a hotel.
-I'm coming with you.

1267
01:40:04,128 --> 01:40:05,651
Where you been?

1268
01:40:07,305 --> 01:40:08,785
I couldn't sleep.

1269
01:40:23,800 --> 01:40:25,105
What the fuck?

1270
01:40:26,716 --> 01:40:28,413
What is it?

1271
01:40:30,459 --> 01:40:32,682
-Jeff?
-You okay?

1272
01:40:32,765 --> 01:40:34,941
I just turned my phone back on.

1273
01:40:35,638 --> 01:40:37,383
I've got like
a hundred messages.

1274
01:40:37,466 --> 01:40:39,298
Jim sent a picture of me
to everyone.

1275
01:40:39,381 --> 01:40:41,861
Yeah.
What's going on?

1276
01:40:42,427 --> 01:40:43,994
What's the picture of?

1277
01:40:44,908 --> 01:40:46,301
It's um...

1278
01:40:46,649 --> 01:40:49,347
You know...
It's dirty, it's not good.

1279
01:40:50,392 --> 01:40:52,959
He's telling everyone you're
leaving him for a woman.

1280
01:40:56,485 --> 01:40:58,530
He sent the picture to everyone.

1281
01:40:59,314 --> 01:41:02,364
My boxing contacts,
my family, everyone.

1282
01:41:02,447 --> 01:41:04,710
Is there anything
you need me to do?

1283
01:41:06,973 --> 01:41:08,888
No, I gotta go.

1284
01:41:13,763 --> 01:41:15,551
Let's pack up and
get out of here.

1285
01:41:15,634 --> 01:41:17,205
You can call him from my place.

1286
01:41:17,288 --> 01:41:20,861
Tell him you'll organize a truck
to come and pick up your stuff.

1287
01:41:20,944 --> 01:41:22,732
And then I'll call my friend
Sharon, who's a lawyer...

1288
01:41:22,815 --> 01:41:24,078
I'm going back home.

1289
01:41:25,253 --> 01:41:26,254
What?

1290
01:41:27,646 --> 01:41:29,387
I have to go back there.

1291
01:41:31,824 --> 01:41:33,261
I need to go home.

1292
01:41:33,652 --> 01:41:35,089
Are you fucking crazy?

1293
01:41:35,872 --> 01:41:37,656
I'm not running away.

1294
01:41:39,397 --> 01:41:41,573
I'm not going into
hiding somewhere.

1295
01:41:42,792 --> 01:41:44,837
I spent half my life hiding.

1296
01:41:45,534 --> 01:41:48,145
That's my house.
That's my things.

1297
01:41:48,537 --> 01:41:50,408
That's my fucking gym.

1298
01:41:51,409 --> 01:41:53,107
I'm not gonna let him
push me out.

1299
01:41:55,631 --> 01:41:57,111
I don't get it.

1300
01:42:17,392 --> 01:42:19,089
I don't understand you.

1301
01:42:32,015 --> 01:42:34,322
I want you to do
something for me.

1302
01:42:37,847 --> 01:42:40,197
I want you to memorize
my phone number.

1303
01:42:43,244 --> 01:42:45,159
Can you do that for me?

1304
01:44:05,717 --> 01:44:07,415
We have to talk.

1305
01:44:12,985 --> 01:44:14,683
I'm gonna lie down.

1306
01:44:15,161 --> 01:44:16,946
My head's killing me.

1307
01:44:19,296 --> 01:44:21,296
I'm gonna take a nap
and then we can talk.

1308
01:44:58,553 --> 01:45:00,381
You okay?

1309
01:45:01,120 --> 01:45:04,385
Yeah, I'm fine.
I just had a nap.

1310
01:45:04,689 --> 01:45:07,388
Is he there?
Can you talk?

1311
01:45:10,521 --> 01:45:12,262
He's in the living room.

1312
01:45:13,263 --> 01:45:15,134
What happened when you got home?

1313
01:45:16,092 --> 01:45:19,965
Nothing. I just told him
I had to take a nap.

1314
01:45:25,188 --> 01:45:26,359
I need to talk with you.

1315
01:45:32,238 --> 01:45:33,588
I'm on the phone.

1316
01:45:40,769 --> 01:45:42,423
I need to talk with you.

1317
01:45:43,598 --> 01:45:47,341
I'll talk to you when I'm done
talking to Rosie.

1318
01:45:55,479 --> 01:45:57,133
I gotta go, Rosie.

1319
01:47:19,476 --> 01:47:20,786
Jim, I'm sorry.

1320
01:47:20,869 --> 01:47:23,654
Go ahead, call your girlfriend.

1321
01:47:24,481 --> 01:47:26,396
Please don't let me die.

1322
01:47:52,074 --> 01:47:54,250
Nope, it's not working either.

1323
01:52:20,734 --> 01:52:22,518
Please...

1324
01:52:23,127 --> 01:52:24,955
Please help...

1325
01:52:25,782 --> 01:52:27,871
Please help me.

1326
01:52:30,874 --> 01:52:32,093
Uh...

1327
01:52:33,398 --> 01:52:35,404
Yeah, go ahead.

1328
01:52:35,487 --> 01:52:37,842
-What happened?
-Drive, please sir.

1329
01:52:37,925 --> 01:52:39,709
I don't wanna die.

1330
01:52:41,450 --> 01:52:43,278
I don't wanna die.

1331
01:52:46,411 --> 01:52:48,330
I'm sorry, I'm...

1332
01:52:48,413 --> 01:52:50,332
I'm getting blood
all over your seat.

1333
01:52:50,415 --> 01:52:51,939
Just keep breathing.

1334
01:52:56,073 --> 01:52:57,165
Let's get her hooked up.

1335
01:52:57,248 --> 01:52:58,689
Get me some
saline and some gauze.

1336
01:52:58,772 --> 01:53:00,125
You can get her hooked up
to the monitor.

1337
01:53:00,208 --> 01:53:02,083
And Brooke, if you
can get an IV for me.

1338
01:53:02,166 --> 01:53:03,868
Hon, I'm gonna cut
your shirt open, okay?

1339
01:53:03,951 --> 01:53:05,391
We gotta look at your wounds.

1340
01:53:05,474 --> 01:53:07,959
One in the left AC.
Pulse is good on this side.

1341
01:53:08,042 --> 01:53:09,917
Alright, she's
bleeding pretty good over here.

1342
01:53:10,000 --> 01:53:11,179
I need two units, O-neg.

1343
01:53:11,262 --> 01:53:12,964
Hi, my name's Nancy.
I'm an ER nurse.

1344
01:53:13,047 --> 01:53:14,570
Can you tell me your name?

1345
01:53:16,050 --> 01:53:17,533
Christy Martin.

1346
01:53:17,616 --> 01:53:19,318
Okay, Christy, we're going to
take good care of you, okay?

1347
01:53:19,401 --> 01:53:21,157
Can you tell me what
happened to you?

1348
01:53:22,708 --> 01:53:24,889
I was shot and stabbed
by my husband.

1349
01:53:24,972 --> 01:53:27,061
It's okay, honey.
You're safe now, okay?

1350
01:53:28,018 --> 01:53:29,458
You're going to be okay.

1351
01:53:29,541 --> 01:53:31,248
Is there anybody
I can call for you?

1352
01:53:31,805 --> 01:53:33,201
-Rosie.
-Rosie?

1353
01:53:33,284 --> 01:53:35,247
Okay, do you know
Rosie's number?

1354
01:53:35,330 --> 01:53:39,120
681-735-0102.

1355
01:53:39,203 --> 01:53:41,949
6817350102?

1356
01:53:42,032 --> 01:53:43,516
-Yeah.
-Okay.

1357
01:53:43,599 --> 01:53:45,300
I'm gonna go call her and tell
her what's happening, okay?

1358
01:53:45,383 --> 01:53:46,475
You're gonna be okay.

1359
01:53:46,558 --> 01:53:48,460
We're gonna take good care
of you, okay?

1360
01:53:48,778 --> 01:53:50,088
Let's get her
prepped for the move

1361
01:53:50,171 --> 01:53:51,737
and let's stop this bleeding.

1362
01:53:52,738 --> 01:53:54,392
Please call Rosie.

1363
01:54:09,930 --> 01:54:11,627
She's okay.

1364
01:54:16,153 --> 01:54:17,550
Sweetheart.

1365
01:54:17,633 --> 01:54:20,549
She's in bad shape, but the
doctors say she'll be okay.

1366
01:54:21,680 --> 01:54:23,378
Oh, sweetheart.

1367
01:54:24,205 --> 01:54:25,340
Has she been awake?

1368
01:54:25,423 --> 01:54:27,821
She was awake
when I, when I got here.

1369
01:54:27,904 --> 01:54:29,514
She's been in and out.

1370
01:54:32,300 --> 01:54:34,215
Oh, I'm so sorry.

1371
01:54:35,956 --> 01:54:37,566
I'm so sorry.

1372
01:54:41,831 --> 01:54:43,964
Can I talk to you outside, please?

1373
01:54:55,627 --> 01:54:57,673
You need to leave.

1374
01:54:58,413 --> 01:55:00,763
It's not right that you're here.

1375
01:55:01,242 --> 01:55:02,334
Christy wants me here.

1376
01:55:02,417 --> 01:55:04,723
Christy doesn't
know what she wants.

1377
01:55:06,769 --> 01:55:09,076
You're the reason
this has happened.

1378
01:55:10,381 --> 01:55:13,732
I'm her mother,
and I want you to leave.

1379
01:55:14,777 --> 01:55:17,562
And I don't wanna talk
anymore about it.

1380
01:55:28,878 --> 01:55:30,358
Where's Rosie?

1381
01:55:31,881 --> 01:55:33,317
She left.

1382
01:55:34,449 --> 01:55:35,972
Where'd she go?

1383
01:55:37,843 --> 01:55:39,323
I don't know.

1384
01:55:41,935 --> 01:55:44,463
-Where's Jim?
-He's been arrested.

1385
01:55:44,546 --> 01:55:46,243
The police found him.

1386
01:55:46,983 --> 01:55:49,337
Hiding in your neighbor's
tool shed.

1387
01:55:49,420 --> 01:55:51,296
He's lucky they found him
before I did.

1388
01:55:51,379 --> 01:55:53,086
I'd have killed that
son-of-a-bitch.

1389
01:55:54,338 --> 01:55:56,514
You know,
it's all over the news.

1390
01:55:58,125 --> 01:56:00,431
And everyone is saying,

1391
01:56:01,432 --> 01:56:05,567
that you were gonna
leave Jim for that woman.

1392
01:56:07,221 --> 01:56:08,487
That woman's name is Rosie.

1393
01:56:08,570 --> 01:56:10,572
I know.

1394
01:56:11,790 --> 01:56:15,276
So I thought,
that you could say,

1395
01:56:15,359 --> 01:56:18,232
that you were with
the other Rosie.

1396
01:56:19,581 --> 01:56:21,935
You know, Rosie Graham.

1397
01:56:22,018 --> 01:56:24,024
And that way people
would understand

1398
01:56:24,107 --> 01:56:25,460
that she's just a friend...

1399
01:56:25,543 --> 01:56:28,202
Mom.
What are you doing?

1400
01:56:28,285 --> 01:56:30,374
You're fucking kidding me?

1401
01:56:33,116 --> 01:56:35,814
You might as well have
pulled the trigger yourself.

1402
01:56:44,040 --> 01:56:45,480
I wish I could have been

1403
01:56:45,563 --> 01:56:47,478
the daughter you
wanted me to be.

1404
01:56:48,914 --> 01:56:51,134
I tried my whole life.

1405
01:56:51,787 --> 01:56:54,355
I tried so fucking hard for you.

1406
01:57:00,230 --> 01:57:02,406
And look where I am, Momma.

1407
01:57:04,408 --> 01:57:06,106
Look where I am.

1408
01:58:01,161 --> 01:58:03,511
The doctor wants
you walking, Christy.

1409
01:58:04,599 --> 01:58:06,296
You've got your walker
right here.

1410
01:58:07,776 --> 01:58:09,434
I don't need that.

1411
01:58:09,517 --> 01:58:11,218
You don't go anywhere
without your walker.

1412
01:58:11,301 --> 01:58:13,303
Doctor's orders.

1413
01:58:28,492 --> 01:58:30,015
Lisa fucking Holewyne?

1414
01:58:32,627 --> 01:58:34,672
What the hell
are you doing here?

1415
01:58:36,152 --> 01:58:38,198
I hope it's alright
I just showed up.

1416
01:58:39,068 --> 01:58:42,027
I just wanted to see
if you were okay.

1417
01:58:43,159 --> 01:58:44,378
Thanks.

1418
01:58:50,035 --> 01:58:51,689
So who's Rosie?

1419
01:58:56,303 --> 01:58:58,700
You sure as hell didn't creep
quietly out of the closet.

1420
01:58:58,783 --> 01:59:00,398
Yeah...

1421
01:59:00,481 --> 01:59:02,177
You peek-a-boo'd this bitch.

1422
01:59:05,138 --> 01:59:06,574
Man...

1423
01:59:07,401 --> 01:59:09,490
People are gonna tear me apart.

1424
01:59:10,795 --> 01:59:13,581
I spent half my career
trash-talking women I fought.

1425
01:59:14,408 --> 01:59:15,891
Calling them dykes or whatever.

1426
01:59:15,974 --> 01:59:17,632
-Oh, really?
-Mm-hm.

1427
01:59:17,715 --> 01:59:19,587
Wow.

1428
01:59:20,283 --> 01:59:21,980
People are gonna
laugh in my face.

1429
01:59:23,286 --> 01:59:26,681
Maybe they will.
You deserve it.

1430
01:59:27,334 --> 01:59:28,596
Yeah.

1431
01:59:29,988 --> 01:59:31,338
But maybe they won't.

1432
01:59:34,123 --> 01:59:38,562
Maybe you've just learned to
expect the worst from people.

1433
01:59:46,309 --> 01:59:47,876
I want to fight again.

1434
01:59:49,269 --> 01:59:50,357
Really?

1435
01:59:51,662 --> 01:59:52,794
Yeah.

1436
01:59:54,143 --> 01:59:56,728
You know no one will hold it
against you if you don't.

1437
01:59:56,928 --> 01:59:58,064
Right?

1438
01:59:58,147 --> 02:00:00,454
You kicked every ass
there was to kick.

1439
02:00:02,717 --> 02:00:04,371
I want it back.

1440
02:00:05,459 --> 02:00:07,200
I want the ring back.

1441
02:00:09,680 --> 02:00:12,161
In there, I'm calm.

1442
02:00:13,380 --> 02:00:16,687
In there, it's quiet. Just
everything goes quiet, you know?

1443
02:00:18,298 --> 02:00:19,473
Yeah.

1444
02:00:20,996 --> 02:00:22,432
Yeah, I know.

1445
02:00:22,867 --> 02:00:25,043
There's rules and
there's boundaries.

1446
02:00:26,001 --> 02:00:31,093
Everywhere else is chaos,
but in there it's quiet.

1447
02:00:32,137 --> 02:00:33,487
And it's mine.

1448
02:00:35,053 --> 02:00:36,577
And I want it without him.

1449
02:00:48,545 --> 02:00:49,938
Well...

1450
02:00:52,636 --> 02:00:54,116
Good luck.

1451
02:00:59,556 --> 02:01:01,079
Thank you.

1452
02:01:12,917 --> 02:01:17,487
Okay, let's get you up.

1453
02:01:19,794 --> 02:01:20,973
Put that thing away.

1454
02:01:21,056 --> 02:01:23,497
-Come on, old lady.
-I ain't doing that.

1455
02:01:23,580 --> 02:01:24,629
Get you boxing ready.

1456
02:01:24,712 --> 02:01:26,587
-Let's go, granny.
-I ain't using that.

1457
02:01:26,670 --> 02:01:28,067
-Not using this?
-Uh-uh.

1458
02:01:28,150 --> 02:01:29,895
-I think it's required.
-It ain't.

1459
02:01:29,978 --> 02:01:32,415
No? I'll take it then.

1460
02:01:33,155 --> 02:01:34,330
Let's go.

1461
02:01:35,984 --> 02:01:37,681
It's nice.
It's good for dips.

1462
02:01:38,116 --> 02:01:39,901
Get a good workout in.

1463
02:01:42,120 --> 02:01:43,600
Keep up.

1464
02:02:25,076 --> 02:02:26,948
Psst! Yo.

1465
02:02:30,604 --> 02:02:32,257
Hey fellas, hold up.

1466
02:02:49,492 --> 02:02:51,276
I'm sorry.

1467
02:03:13,168 --> 02:03:14,782
I don't know, Christy.

1468
02:03:14,865 --> 02:03:18,220
Let me remind you, you got shot
and stabbed two weeks ago.

1469
02:03:18,303 --> 02:03:19,831
Yeah, so?

1470
02:03:19,914 --> 02:03:22,529
Yeah, so I don't know
that you should be training yet.

1471
02:03:22,612 --> 02:03:24,139
You need to get better first.

1472
02:03:24,222 --> 02:03:27,795
This is me getting better.
I want a fight.

1473
02:03:27,878 --> 02:03:30,315
I want you to train me.
Can you get me a fight?

1474
02:03:31,142 --> 02:03:34,189
Come on, Papi.
Get me a fight.

1475
02:03:37,061 --> 02:03:38,019
Jeff?

1476
02:03:45,287 --> 02:03:46,597
Alright, champ.

1477
02:03:46,680 --> 02:03:48,725
You've got it.
We'll get you a fight.

1478
02:03:49,422 --> 02:03:50,901
Fuck yeah!

1479
02:04:02,173 --> 02:04:04,136
I go to a restaurant

1480
02:04:04,219 --> 02:04:06,526
and I realize I don't know
what to order.

1481
02:04:08,049 --> 02:04:10,486
I don't know what to cook
for myself at home.

1482
02:04:11,182 --> 02:04:13,315
I don't know what
clothes I want to wear,

1483
02:04:14,055 --> 02:04:16,231
or what I want to
watch on television.

1484
02:04:17,841 --> 02:04:20,148
I have no idea
who I actually am.

1485
02:04:21,062 --> 02:04:23,891
Every aspect of my life has
been controlled by this man.

1486
02:04:25,327 --> 02:04:27,024
Every decision.

1487
02:04:27,372 --> 02:04:29,070
Everyone I talk to.

1488
02:04:30,550 --> 02:04:32,639
I don't know who
I can trust anymore.

1489
02:04:33,683 --> 02:04:35,555
Not even my own family.

1490
02:04:39,341 --> 02:04:41,778
I don't have many regrets
in my life.

1491
02:04:42,736 --> 02:04:45,608
But I regret not accepting help
when it was offered.

1492
02:04:46,391 --> 02:04:47,614
And I wish I would have
walked out

1493
02:04:47,697 --> 02:04:49,743
the first time
you promised to kill me.

1494
02:04:50,483 --> 02:04:52,572
Maybe I thought you were joking.

1495
02:04:52,920 --> 02:04:55,270
But I know now that whatever
it was you intended,

1496
02:04:55,923 --> 02:04:58,012
a good man
doesn't say that shit.

1497
02:04:59,579 --> 02:05:01,232
But you said it.

1498
02:05:02,320 --> 02:05:05,585
You said it over and over again.

1499
02:05:06,890 --> 02:05:09,284
And then you came good
on that promise.

1500
02:05:10,372 --> 02:05:11,812
But guess what, motherfucker?

1501
02:05:11,895 --> 02:05:13,510
You didn't kill me.

1502
02:05:13,593 --> 02:05:15,294
Your Honor, I'm going
to object at this time.

1503
02:05:15,377 --> 02:05:17,074
This is confrontational.

1504
02:05:17,379 --> 02:05:18,558
Are you fucking kidding me?

1505
02:05:18,641 --> 02:05:20,125
-I'm confrontational?
-Sustained.

1506
02:05:20,208 --> 02:05:23,298
Miss Salters, I need you to just
read your statement, please.

1507
02:05:29,522 --> 02:05:31,306
You stabbed me.

1508
02:05:32,525 --> 02:05:33,917
Look at me!

1509
02:05:34,657 --> 02:05:36,006
Look at me, Jim.

1510
02:05:41,359 --> 02:05:42,883
You stabbed me.

1511
02:05:43,971 --> 02:05:45,407
You shot me.

1512
02:05:46,974 --> 02:05:49,237
You left me for dead
on the bedroom floor.

1513
02:05:50,804 --> 02:05:54,372
But like most else -
you came up short.

1514
02:05:55,504 --> 02:05:58,076
You came up short, didn't you,
you fucking piece of shit.

1515
02:05:58,159 --> 02:06:00,509
-Objection.
-Miss Salters.

1516
02:06:02,380 --> 02:06:03,686
It's alright.

1517
02:06:04,948 --> 02:06:06,254
I'm done.

1518
02:06:09,083 --> 02:06:10,519
I'm done.

1519
02:06:33,281 --> 02:06:35,196
Knock her out, champ.
