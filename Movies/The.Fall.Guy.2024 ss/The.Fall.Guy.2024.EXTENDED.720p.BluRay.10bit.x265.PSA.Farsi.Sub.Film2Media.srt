1
00:00:17,866 --> 00:00:18,866
<i>Back to one.</i>

2
00:00:20,708 --> 00:00:23,142
<i>Let's get it quiet, please.
Everyone, stay off channel one now.</i>

3
00:00:23,265 --> 00:00:24,948
<i>This is a take,
not a rehearsal.</i>

4
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:26,547
<i>Picture is up.</i>

5
00:00:26,972 --> 00:00:27,947
<i>Camera's set.</i>

6
00:00:28,365 --> 00:00:29,238
<i>Let's roll sound!</i>

7
00:00:29,572 --> 00:00:30,612
<i>Sound speed.</i>

8
00:00:31,088 --> 00:00:32,600
<i>Let's speed cameras.</i>

9
00:00:33,288 --> 00:00:34,439
<i>Camera one speeding.</i>

10
00:00:34,672 --> 00:00:36,072
<i>Camera two speeding.</i>

11
00:00:36,652 --> 00:00:37,993
<i>"B" camera mark.</i>

12
00:00:39,531 --> 00:00:40,171
<i>"C" mark.</i>

13
00:00:41,544 --> 00:00:42,757
<i>Stunts ready?</i>

14
00:00:44,144 --> 00:00:44,770
<i>Ready.</i>

15
00:00:46,606 --> 00:00:48,902
<i>In three, two, one, action.</i>

16
00:00:57,533 --> 00:00:59,300
<i>They're in almost every movie.</i>

17
00:01:00,546 --> 00:01:01,745
<i>You just don't know
that they're there.</i>

18
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:05,066
<i>'Cause that's the job.</i>

19
00:01:07,333 --> 00:01:09,429
<i>They're the unknown
stunt performers.</i>

20
00:01:11,226 --> 00:01:13,060
<i>And they get paid
to do the cool stuff.</i>

21
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:20,433
<i>They also get paid
to take it on the chin.</i>

22
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:26,233
<i>And everywhere else,
if you know what I mean.</i>

23
00:01:28,866 --> 00:01:30,866
<i>Oh, that's... that's me.</i>

24
00:01:31,225 --> 00:01:32,325
<i>Colt Seavers.</i>

25
00:01:32,872 --> 00:01:35,672
<i>Getting blown up and hiding
my face in a muddy puddle.</i>

26
00:01:36,026 --> 00:01:37,459
<i>Which isn't ideal</i>

27
00:01:37,484 --> 00:01:39,618
<i>when you're trying to look cool
in front of Jody.</i>

28
00:01:40,166 --> 00:01:43,266
<i>Who you just so happen
to have a major crush on.</i>

29
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:44,632
<i>She's a camera operator.</i>

30
00:01:44,665 --> 00:01:45,824
<i>Looking for Tom Ryder's stunt double.</i>

31
00:01:45,850 --> 00:01:47,358
<i>She's definitely gonna achieve her goal</i>

32
00:01:47,382 --> 00:01:49,869
<i>of being a big-time Hollywood
movie director.</i>

33
00:01:51,375 --> 00:01:54,012
- You're so uncoordinated.
- <i>I don't wanna over romanticize it or anything, but,</i>

34
00:01:54,258 --> 00:01:56,786
<i>I think what Jody and I
got's the kind of thing</i>

35
00:01:56,899 --> 00:01:58,632
<i>we can only really find in the movies</i>

36
00:01:58,759 --> 00:01:59,859
- Hey. Jody.
- Thank you.

37
00:02:00,006 --> 00:02:01,793
Hey, Colt. Thanks so
much for the stunt chat.

38
00:02:01,817 --> 00:02:04,215
Stunt chats.
I love 'em. Anytime.

39
00:02:04,308 --> 00:02:05,875
Hey, uh, Tom needs to see you
at the monitor.

40
00:02:06,248 --> 00:02:07,162
- Uh-oh.
- Yeah.

41
00:02:07,969 --> 00:02:08,770
Am I in trouble?

42
00:02:09,089 --> 00:02:10,662
<i>She's talking about Tom Ryder,</i>

43
00:02:10,753 --> 00:02:13,182
<i>who happens to be the biggest
action star on the pl--</i>

44
00:02:13,442 --> 00:02:15,049
<i>Wait, why am I explaining this?</i>

45
00:02:15,079 --> 00:02:17,555
<i>You know who Tom Ryder is.
He's Tom Ryder.</i>

46
00:02:18,254 --> 00:02:21,147
Anyway, I've been his
stunt double for six years now.

47
00:02:21,241 --> 00:02:21,768
Uh...

48
00:02:22,674 --> 00:02:23,731
flying in.

49
00:02:28,832 --> 00:02:30,566
What happened? What's up?

50
00:02:30,933 --> 00:02:31,686
Guess we're going again.

51
00:02:32,113 --> 00:02:33,180
You know Tom and Gail.

52
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:35,547
There's a lot of grumbling
and a bunch of hand gestures

53
00:02:35,572 --> 00:02:38,391
over at the monitor, so I'm
not sure what's going on there,

54
00:02:38,416 --> 00:02:39,972
- but...
- Let me guess-- too much face.

55
00:02:41,266 --> 00:02:43,583
Okay, guys. Go to one for me.

56
00:02:43,727 --> 00:02:44,827
Um...

57
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:46,980
- Jody, right?
- What's your name again?

58
00:02:47,133 --> 00:02:48,512
As you can see, that is not my chin.

59
00:02:48,537 --> 00:02:51,107
When you look at my face, look
at my jaw compared to his jaw,

60
00:02:51,194 --> 00:02:52,769
it's like his chin is off.

61
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:54,113
- It's like...
- Yeah, we can't replace his face.

62
00:02:54,220 --> 00:02:55,607
It's like Mr. Potato Head.

63
00:02:55,886 --> 00:02:57,486
I mean, no offense or anything,
but you know.

64
00:02:57,566 --> 00:02:59,465
Oh, yeah, no. Sorry, I got lost
in your beautiful jawline.

65
00:03:00,364 --> 00:03:01,375
- It's dreamy.
- No, listen,

66
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:03,185
we're just saying
it's not working for us.

67
00:03:03,305 --> 00:03:03,986
- Let's, uh...
- Okay.

68
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:05,773
Let's go again.

69
00:03:06,215 --> 00:03:07,725
Oh, yeah, no,
we're gonna have to go again.

70
00:03:07,799 --> 00:03:08,133
Okay.

71
00:03:08,166 --> 00:03:09,200
- Yeah.
- 100%.

72
00:03:09,533 --> 00:03:11,187
I don't know, man.
Do you think, um...

73
00:03:11,485 --> 00:03:12,391
Try and make some magic?

74
00:03:12,541 --> 00:03:14,159
Maybe you could do it
backwards or something?

75
00:03:14,183 --> 00:03:15,038
I don't know.

76
00:03:15,111 --> 00:03:16,995
- It's just... less face.
- Yeah.

77
00:03:17,126 --> 00:03:18,571
<i>The woman freebasing
the Diet Coke</i>

78
00:03:18,595 --> 00:03:19,856
<i>is Tom's producer Gail.</i>

79
00:03:19,936 --> 00:03:21,900
- <i>She's been making him look good for years.</i>
-Thank you.

80
00:03:22,133 --> 00:03:23,736
-<i>And it's not always easy.</i>
- All right. Give me some.

81
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:26,193
- Oh! I'm gonna...
- <i>I can't complain.</i>

82
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,267
<i>I'm working with my dream girl,</i>

83
00:03:29,087 --> 00:03:30,700
<i>On my dream job.</i>

84
00:03:31,133 --> 00:03:32,675
We got to switch
the pick points to the front.

85
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:34,271
- <i>I'm living the dream.</i>
- He wants to go again.

86
00:03:34,296 --> 00:03:37,396
<i>Copy that, Colt. We'll flip the rig.
You'll be falling backwards.</i>

87
00:03:38,133 --> 00:03:39,233
Jody, go to two.

88
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:44,066
<i>Do you have a question for me?</i>

89
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:46,565
Uh, yeah. It just looked
just now like you wanted

90
00:03:46,590 --> 00:03:47,700
to ask me something.

91
00:03:47,866 --> 00:03:50,187
<i>Oh, I was gonna go for
a spicy margarita after work.</i>

92
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:52,573
<i>I was wondering
if you drink spicy margaritas.</i>

93
00:03:54,745 --> 00:03:56,957
Um, well,
just to keep it professional,

94
00:03:56,982 --> 00:03:58,783
I can only have
one spicy margarita.

95
00:03:58,933 --> 00:04:01,797
Because if I have two,
I start making bad decisions.

96
00:04:02,535 --> 00:04:03,575
<i>Well, you know,
drinking margaritas</i>

97
00:04:03,657 --> 00:04:05,435
<i>is all about
making bad decisions.</i>

98
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:08,408
Which reminds me, um,

99
00:04:08,866 --> 00:04:11,956
after this job, I-I got to go
sit on the sand somewhere,

100
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,393
and I was wondering, uh...
I was gonna ask you a question.

101
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:15,833
<i>Tell me.</i>

102
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:19,133
Do you have any towels
that I can borrow?

103
00:04:20,975 --> 00:04:22,141
Yeah, I have some towels.

104
00:04:22,166 --> 00:04:24,300
<i>You know, it's so dangerous
to swim alone.</i>

105
00:04:25,466 --> 00:04:28,022
Well, I would ask you to,
you know, be my swim buddy,

106
00:04:28,047 --> 00:04:30,214
but I don't know
if you have a bathing suit.

107
00:04:30,286 --> 00:04:32,752
Wait a second. What do you
call that across the pond?

108
00:04:33,733 --> 00:04:35,612
<i>We call it a swimming costume.</i>

109
00:04:38,733 --> 00:04:39,520
Imagine that.

110
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:41,953
After this,
you and I could both be

111
00:04:42,207 --> 00:04:44,678
on the beach somewhere
in swimming costumes

112
00:04:44,905 --> 00:04:46,833
drinking spicy margaritas,

113
00:04:46,959 --> 00:04:49,062
- making bad decisions.
- Okay, good to go.

114
00:04:49,266 --> 00:04:50,343
<i>Imagine that.</i>

115
00:04:52,244 --> 00:04:54,318
Okay, let's keep it
locked up all around!

116
00:04:55,884 --> 00:04:58,071
- Let's strap him in.
- Everyone quiet, please!

117
00:04:59,566 --> 00:05:00,500
Speed on "A."

118
00:05:04,191 --> 00:05:06,285
- You all right?
- All right, let's take him to ones.

119
00:05:07,108 --> 00:05:09,888
- Going to ones.
- Go ahead and sit back for me.

120
00:05:11,016 --> 00:05:12,283
Let's go hot on stunts.

121
00:05:12,416 --> 00:05:14,322
- And going out to the edge.
- Stunts is hot.

122
00:05:15,399 --> 00:05:16,733
How we doing up there, stunt?

123
00:05:16,850 --> 00:05:19,371
- Great. He's great. Here we go.
- Position down.

124
00:05:21,051 --> 00:05:21,731
He's at ones.

125
00:05:24,334 --> 00:05:25,514
Ready to drop the line for me?

126
00:05:25,666 --> 00:05:28,479
And three, two, one.

127
00:05:28,746 --> 00:05:30,500
Action, action, action,
action, action!

128
00:05:35,970 --> 00:05:37,610
Call the medic! Medic!

129
00:05:41,725 --> 00:05:42,978
Colt, are you okay?

130
00:05:44,171 --> 00:05:45,608
I need you to step back.

131
00:05:45,905 --> 00:05:47,337
You're not helping.

132
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,572
Break time's over.
You've got a customer.

133
00:06:18,357 --> 00:06:19,500
No. 43.

134
00:06:24,666 --> 00:06:26,805
Yo, bro, I know you
from somewhere.

135
00:06:27,066 --> 00:06:28,600
Where I know you from, bro?

136
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:32,061
Oh, yeah, you were on
that Tom Ryder movie I was on.

137
00:06:32,223 --> 00:06:34,377
- You're the stunt guy!
- Not anymore.

138
00:06:34,496 --> 00:06:37,276
- Did you, like, break your back or some shit?
- I did, yeah.

139
00:06:37,413 --> 00:06:39,080
How are you even still alive?
Yo, babe.

140
00:06:39,136 --> 00:06:40,175
- Babe, hey, come here.
- I don't know.

141
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:41,675
I wish I wasn't right now.

142
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:43,261
Come here.
You got to hear this.

143
00:06:43,347 --> 00:06:44,331
You don't have to hear this.

144
00:06:44,466 --> 00:06:46,649
- It's fine. Hi.
- This dude was on a movie I was on.

145
00:06:46,982 --> 00:06:50,500
Most epic fail I've ever seen.

146
00:06:50,758 --> 00:06:52,824
They let him hanging
up there on these wires

147
00:06:52,971 --> 00:06:54,751
he look like a little piñata.

148
00:06:54,825 --> 00:06:55,345
Action!

149
00:06:55,668 --> 00:06:59,186
This guy falls about 1,000 miles an hour.

150
00:06:59,266 --> 00:07:01,026
I'm like, "this guy's gonna die bro."

151
00:07:01,166 --> 00:07:04,362
"This guy's gonna die."
10 meters above the ground...

152
00:07:04,422 --> 00:07:05,122
Snap!

153
00:07:05,666 --> 00:07:08,909
He cracks into this disgusting pretzel.

154
00:07:09,133 --> 00:07:10,835
It's all pretty foggy, then.

155
00:07:11,933 --> 00:07:14,899
So, like...
stunt man to valet.

156
00:07:16,972 --> 00:07:18,106
How does that happen?

157
00:07:19,533 --> 00:07:20,633
Hell of a fall.

158
00:07:22,266 --> 00:07:23,107
Let me get your car.

159
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:24,833
Yo, fall guy?

160
00:07:25,466 --> 00:07:28,266
Yo, bring my car back
without a scratch,

161
00:07:29,066 --> 00:07:31,066
I got a crispy fiver
here for you, bro.

162
00:08:56,852 --> 00:08:57,820
No!

163
00:09:03,490 --> 00:09:06,202
Chill! It's a rental!

164
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:59,760
- Hello?
- Oh! Colt.

165
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:01,666
it's Gail.

166
00:10:01,805 --> 00:10:03,573
<i>Your favourite producer.</i>

167
00:10:03,598 --> 00:10:04,800
How do you get this number?

168
00:10:05,133 --> 00:10:07,500
Someone said you were working
at the Captain's Cockatoo.

169
00:10:08,006 --> 00:10:08,880
A valet.

170
00:10:09,126 --> 00:10:11,066
<i>Wow! I didn't believe it.</i>

171
00:10:11,266 --> 00:10:14,166
It's actually
El Cacatúa del Capitan.

172
00:10:14,262 --> 00:10:16,809
It's a family-run place.
We pool tips.

173
00:10:17,066 --> 00:10:18,650
<i>Nice change for my whole job.</i>

174
00:10:18,966 --> 00:10:20,152
I'm sure it is.
I'm sure it is.

175
00:10:20,177 --> 00:10:21,428
And to that point you know,

176
00:10:21,694 --> 00:10:24,477
I know things haven't
been easy for you since...

177
00:10:25,035 --> 00:10:25,862
the incident.

178
00:10:26,041 --> 00:10:29,303
<i>And I just hope that you
don't hold it against me</i>

179
00:10:29,328 --> 00:10:30,328
<i>or Tom, yeah?</i>

180
00:10:30,366 --> 00:10:31,932
We were absolutely

181
00:10:32,026 --> 00:10:33,006
<i>devastated.</i>

182
00:10:33,259 --> 00:10:34,419
<i>He sent you a message, right?</i>

183
00:10:36,759 --> 00:10:37,933
The prayer hands emoji?

184
00:10:38,033 --> 00:10:39,873
<i>Right, yeah, he's still an asshole,</i>

185
00:10:40,097 --> 00:10:43,464
<i>but God, he was a force
in Annihilation of Valor.</i>

186
00:10:43,766 --> 00:10:46,100
I'm coming for you, Billy!

187
00:10:49,701 --> 00:10:50,407
<i>He's the best.</i>

188
00:10:50,873 --> 00:10:52,013
Oneself a Globe.

189
00:10:52,533 --> 00:10:53,567
So do one the Oscar.

190
00:10:53,986 --> 00:10:55,599
He is so authentic.

191
00:10:55,775 --> 00:10:57,375
<i>I don't blame</i> either one of you, Gail.

192
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:58,666
That was my fault.

193
00:10:59,015 --> 00:11:01,075
And when you start making
mistakes like that,

194
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:02,286
it's time to hang up the pads.

195
00:11:02,366 --> 00:11:03,960
<i>Oh, it was an accident, Colt.</i>

196
00:11:04,013 --> 00:11:05,513
<i>Everybody knows that.</i>

197
00:11:07,096 --> 00:11:10,857
Tom has put me
in a real situation here, Colt.

198
00:11:11,075 --> 00:11:13,941
I just need a little bit
of help from an old friend,

199
00:11:13,966 --> 00:11:16,401
who just happens to be,
you know, the best stuntman

200
00:11:16,426 --> 00:11:18,160
<i>I've ever worked with in my life.</i>

201
00:11:18,366 --> 00:11:21,047
<i>Which is why you are getting
on a plane for me tomorrow</i>

202
00:11:21,167 --> 00:11:23,422
- <i>and coming to Sydney.</i>
- I'm not getting on a plane, Gail.

203
00:11:23,447 --> 00:11:24,088
You know, Colt,

204
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:27,742
Tom Ryder is the biggest
action brand on the planet,

205
00:11:27,906 --> 00:11:30,164
but that is largely because of you.

206
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:33,605
<i>Metalstorm will be an epic
stunt extravaganza.</i>

207
00:11:33,630 --> 00:11:35,101
My life is simple now, Gail.

208
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:37,566
I like simple.

209
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:41,208
Plus, I get
all the burritos I can eat.

210
00:11:41,566 --> 00:11:42,433
So...

211
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:44,934
kind of living the dream
if you think about it.

212
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:47,466
I can't bear that you would
throw away all that talent.

213
00:11:47,466 --> 00:11:49,586
You shouldn't be parking cars, Colt.

214
00:11:49,766 --> 00:11:53,572
You need to be smashing burning
Kawasakis through paint of glass.

215
00:11:53,912 --> 00:11:55,067
<i>I know you've missed it.</i>

216
00:11:55,139 --> 00:11:55,681
Goodbye, Gail.

217
00:11:55,706 --> 00:11:57,106
Wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait!

218
00:11:57,189 --> 00:11:58,375
Hold on. Did I...

219
00:11:58,400 --> 00:11:59,271
Did I tell you?

220
00:11:59,375 --> 00:12:01,597
Did I tell you that
the directors asked for you specifically?

221
00:12:01,797 --> 00:12:02,866
Sorry to disappoint him.

222
00:12:02,933 --> 00:12:04,072
<i>Well, then you wanna know who it is?</i>

223
00:12:04,166 --> 00:12:04,819
Nope.

224
00:12:05,533 --> 00:12:06,500
<i>it's Jody.</i>

225
00:12:11,066 --> 00:12:12,721
<i>I'm giving her a big break.</i>

226
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:14,500
Make sure it's an aisle seat.

227
00:12:17,972 --> 00:12:20,645
<i>Earth, minerals, stone.</i>

228
00:12:20,905 --> 00:12:23,508
<i>A new eau de parfum
by Tom Ryder.</i>

229
00:12:47,466 --> 00:12:48,866
- Is that--
- Yeah.

230
00:12:49,066 --> 00:12:51,466
I didn't realize they were,
uh, scanning doubles now.

231
00:12:51,699 --> 00:12:53,225
Eh, it's new technology.

232
00:12:53,379 --> 00:12:55,594
Basically, we use the
geometry of your face

233
00:12:55,618 --> 00:12:57,046
to retarget Ryder's face,

234
00:12:57,113 --> 00:12:59,213
and we put Ryder's face
back on top of your face.

235
00:12:59,566 --> 00:13:01,300
Like a deepfake situation.

236
00:13:02,366 --> 00:13:04,433
If you get a chance, turn me
into Tom Cruise, would you?

237
00:13:05,966 --> 00:13:07,963
Hey, welcome to Sydney.
Are you Colt Seavers?

238
00:13:08,714 --> 00:13:11,261
Yeah. Hey. Do you know
where I can get some coffee?

239
00:13:11,292 --> 00:13:12,840
This jet lag
is really kicking in.

240
00:13:12,884 --> 00:13:14,039
Yeah, no stress. I got you.

241
00:13:14,064 --> 00:13:15,801
And does the director know
I'm here?

242
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:17,469
- She asked for me.
- Uh...

243
00:13:17,493 --> 00:13:18,831
Does-does she want
to say hi or...?

244
00:13:18,856 --> 00:13:20,528
I haven't heard.
No, sorry, bro.

245
00:13:20,655 --> 00:13:22,425
Uh, but the stunt coordinator
wants to see you.

246
00:13:22,492 --> 00:13:24,569
- He's just in the jacket there.
- Okay, great.

247
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:26,211
Will you just tell her
I'm here and...

248
00:13:26,685 --> 00:13:28,205
you know, that coffee
if you get a chance?

249
00:13:29,666 --> 00:13:30,686
Dan Tucker.

250
00:13:31,366 --> 00:13:33,553
Big-time Hollywood
stunt coordinator.

251
00:13:34,853 --> 00:13:35,806
It's about time.

252
00:13:36,977 --> 00:13:37,811
Congratulations.

253
00:13:38,123 --> 00:13:39,733
Thank you. Look at you.

254
00:13:39,733 --> 00:13:42,600
So do I call you "sir" now,
or how does that work?

255
00:13:42,625 --> 00:13:44,181
Oh, feel free
to call me "boss," you know.

256
00:13:44,206 --> 00:13:44,648
Okay, boss.

257
00:13:45,068 --> 00:13:46,936
I don't think I should be
in this Nomex, right?

258
00:13:46,961 --> 00:13:49,278
I mean, it's like, we're not
doing anything crazy, are we?

259
00:13:49,303 --> 00:13:50,906
I was just about
to explain that, actually.

260
00:13:50,933 --> 00:13:52,713
- Just follow me.
- Okay.

261
00:13:52,806 --> 00:13:54,506
- How're you doing?
- I'm good

262
00:13:54,632 --> 00:13:56,119
I'm great. Keeping busy.

263
00:13:56,193 --> 00:13:57,053
Been surfing.

264
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:59,232
Was growing my hair out
like a few minutes ago.

265
00:13:59,686 --> 00:14:01,679
- Try my hand at bonsai.
- Bonsai.

266
00:14:02,133 --> 00:14:04,152
Sounds like you got a
pretty full schedule there.

267
00:14:04,273 --> 00:14:05,173
Staying busy.

268
00:14:06,933 --> 00:14:08,812
So what made you wanna
come back to work?

269
00:14:09,933 --> 00:14:11,998
What? I was told that
Jody asked for me?

270
00:14:12,666 --> 00:14:14,062
So I knew I had to come, right?

271
00:14:14,366 --> 00:14:16,200
- Oh well...
- What am I gonna do? Not come?

272
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:18,285
I mean...
She wants me here I gotta be here.

273
00:14:18,650 --> 00:14:19,456
All right.

274
00:14:19,492 --> 00:14:21,426
Everybody huddle up.
Listen up.

275
00:14:21,713 --> 00:14:23,933
First up today is the car roll

276
00:14:23,933 --> 00:14:25,833
we've been rehearsing all week.

277
00:14:26,972 --> 00:14:28,366
Everybody knows their spots,

278
00:14:28,972 --> 00:14:30,768
everybody knows
their responsibilities.

279
00:14:31,141 --> 00:14:32,042
We do this right,

280
00:14:32,366 --> 00:14:34,251
we do the safe and
everybody goes home.

281
00:14:35,004 --> 00:14:36,300
Bad news,

282
00:14:37,466 --> 00:14:38,911
we lost our drive.

283
00:14:39,545 --> 00:14:40,848
So Henry's out.

284
00:14:41,299 --> 00:14:42,767
But good news is,

285
00:14:43,125 --> 00:14:45,134
the cinema gods...

286
00:14:46,005 --> 00:14:47,509
have blessed us

287
00:14:47,819 --> 00:14:50,922
with the greatest stunt man
I've ever worked with,

288
00:14:51,180 --> 00:14:53,251
put your hands together,

289
00:14:53,659 --> 00:15:00,839
for Colt Seavers!

290
00:15:06,553 --> 00:15:07,430
A cannon roll?!

291
00:15:07,566 --> 00:15:10,000
It's time for you to start
rolling cars again

292
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,300
instead of parking them.

293
00:15:11,613 --> 00:15:12,900
You had an accident.

294
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:16,679
It was a massive
miscalculation of the rig.

295
00:15:16,766 --> 00:15:18,958
I-I almost killed myself
in front of the whole crew.

296
00:15:19,026 --> 00:15:21,066
You know, I'd rather just not
have my first stunt back

297
00:15:21,066 --> 00:15:23,200
be another epic failure,
especially in front of Jody.

298
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:24,000
I mean, you understand.

299
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,069
"It's not about how hard
of a hit you can give."

300
00:15:27,933 --> 00:15:30,302
"It's about how many times
you can get hit

301
00:15:30,482 --> 00:15:32,375
- Come on.
- and keep moving forward."

302
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:35,397
That's messed up. You can't
quote Rocky on me like that.

303
00:15:36,733 --> 00:15:38,966
So it's a laser gun
with a dagger?

304
00:15:38,966 --> 00:15:40,466
- Yes, like a bayonet.
- Right.

305
00:15:40,466 --> 00:15:42,289
Do we need the bayonet?
Wouldn't the laser achieve...

306
00:15:42,356 --> 00:15:44,100
On the battlefield, yes.
Hundred percent.

307
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:45,786
It just gives it
a quite a strange shape.

308
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:47,283
- Oh, this guitar bit at the end?
- Yeah.

309
00:15:47,666 --> 00:15:48,729
Yeah, well, you said
you wanted metal,

310
00:15:48,770 --> 00:15:50,524
so it's, like, heavy metal.

311
00:15:50,946 --> 00:15:52,339
How many
have you done like this?

312
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:53,766
- Uh, two.
- Okay.

313
00:15:53,766 --> 00:15:55,932
- Hundred.
- Ooh. Okay. Yeah, fantastic.

314
00:15:56,020 --> 00:15:58,137
- Thanks, boss.
- Okay. It looks like a guitar

315
00:15:58,162 --> 00:16:00,284
- Yes.
- Nigel, how we doing on the pyrotechnics?

316
00:16:00,339 --> 00:16:01,875
- What's going on?
- I think we only have enough for one take.

317
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:02,991
- No. Come on.
- Boss, listen.

318
00:16:03,038 --> 00:16:03,432
Yes.

319
00:16:03,511 --> 00:16:05,111
We could create something that
looks way

320
00:16:05,158 --> 00:16:06,684
- more realistic with VFX.
- No, no, no.

321
00:16:06,709 --> 00:16:07,624
- Venti, Venti, Venti.
- Come on.

322
00:16:07,649 --> 00:16:08,638
- Give it to me.
- I don't want real.

323
00:16:08,678 --> 00:16:11,192
This is a sci-fi epic,
cosmic love story.

324
00:16:11,411 --> 00:16:13,066
Okay?
Of cosmic proportions.

325
00:16:13,066 --> 00:16:15,200
It's got to mirror
that otherworldly thing

326
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:17,196
when you fall in love.
You know, it's imperfect.

327
00:16:17,366 --> 00:16:19,309
It's beautiful.
I want it that way, okay?

328
00:16:19,493 --> 00:16:21,220
Let's go big with
our one take, okay?

329
00:16:21,726 --> 00:16:22,882
Holy shit.

330
00:16:22,907 --> 00:16:23,934
Was that it?
Was that my one take?

331
00:16:23,959 --> 00:16:24,782
Uh, I'm sure we have--

332
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:25,636
Oh, my God!

333
00:16:25,660 --> 00:16:28,182
Well, I got to say, though,
looks absolutely fantastic.

334
00:16:28,207 --> 00:16:28,866
Look at that.

335
00:16:28,866 --> 00:16:30,240
You sure you want
to use real pyros?

336
00:16:30,333 --> 00:16:31,473
- Yeah.
- But we definitely don't need this.

337
00:16:31,498 --> 00:16:32,266
- No, no, no, no. Yeah.
- We don't.

338
00:16:32,266 --> 00:16:33,466
Well, we're just gonna
have to loop the actors.

339
00:16:33,466 --> 00:16:34,366
- That's all.
- That's okay, Ray.

340
00:16:34,366 --> 00:16:36,992
It's a stuntman in a car
with a helmet on, okay?

341
00:16:37,086 --> 00:16:39,756
- No looping. No monologuing.
- What the hell is going on over there, Rush?

342
00:16:39,781 --> 00:16:41,056
We did not call for pyro.

343
00:16:42,116 --> 00:16:44,900
I will seriously track down your family
and kill every last one of them!

344
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:45,861
This is why they're doing it.

345
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,416
'Cause they feel you don't
respect them, Nigel, okay?

346
00:16:48,533 --> 00:16:50,709
Your tone,
your words, all of it, just...

347
00:16:50,756 --> 00:16:52,396
Darla, yes? Okay. Yeah.

348
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:55,136
Sorry, I... I couldn't get my printer
working last night...

349
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:56,815
...but I sort of synthesized
our conversation

350
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:58,262
that we had on the third act,
and what if

351
00:16:58,748 --> 00:17:01,570
one of the characters in the
film acknowledges in the film

352
00:17:01,666 --> 00:17:03,229
that we're having a problem
with the third act?

353
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:05,590
- Yeah?
- No. No.

354
00:17:05,670 --> 00:17:07,449
But I appreciate you thinking
outside the box, Darla.

355
00:17:07,481 --> 00:17:09,333
I really really do.
Nigel you've got to stop them.

356
00:17:09,333 --> 00:17:12,487
I will gut you like the pigs
that you are! Stop testing!

357
00:17:13,064 --> 00:17:13,917
 -Boss!
- Yep?

358
00:17:14,277 --> 00:17:16,201
- Test went well.
- Fantastic.

359
00:17:16,354 --> 00:17:19,406
Okay, so, guys, simmer down.
Eyes on me.

360
00:17:19,473 --> 00:17:21,415
Here's what's gonna happen. No VFX, Venti.

361
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:22,461
It looks absolutely fabulous.

362
00:17:22,521 --> 00:17:24,385
Nigel, we need to shoot now.
The tide's coming in.

363
00:17:24,451 --> 00:17:25,785
Let's go.
The shot's gonna be epic.

364
00:17:25,898 --> 00:17:27,766
Shot's up in five, people.
Thank you.

365
00:17:39,139 --> 00:17:40,593
Colt? Brother?

366
00:17:42,133 --> 00:17:43,366
What's happening, man?

367
00:17:44,148 --> 00:17:45,987
- Bad sand.
- Bad sand.

368
00:17:46,012 --> 00:17:46,472
Yeah.

369
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:48,900
I think we got to postpone.

370
00:17:49,291 --> 00:17:49,918
Hate to say it.

371
00:17:49,945 --> 00:17:51,108
<i>Dan, what's the delay, please?</i>

372
00:17:51,133 --> 00:17:52,935
Uh, we're just doing
a little safety check.

373
00:17:53,355 --> 00:17:54,659
It's the density.
It's bad density.

374
00:17:54,686 --> 00:17:56,416
We're looking at
the density of the sand.

375
00:17:56,733 --> 00:17:58,266
- There's a new driver.
- Who is it?

376
00:17:58,266 --> 00:17:59,041
Where's Henry?

377
00:17:59,255 --> 00:18:01,566
Nigel, this is the biggest
shot of the film,

378
00:18:01,566 --> 00:18:02,500
and I have a newbie.

379
00:18:03,979 --> 00:18:05,755
- Dan says we can do it.
- Okay.

380
00:18:06,115 --> 00:18:07,770
Seriously, we're gonna drift
all over the place.

381
00:18:08,679 --> 00:18:10,012
What is that, a king tide?

382
00:18:10,333 --> 00:18:11,733
Here's what you do.
You wait till it comes in.

383
00:18:11,733 --> 00:18:14,222
It compacts the sand,
then we shoot sunset for sun up.

384
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:15,766
You're stalling.

385
00:18:15,966 --> 00:18:17,281
- Maybe.
- You're stalling.

386
00:18:17,527 --> 00:18:19,607
- Two things can be true.
- Brother, I've got

387
00:18:19,713 --> 00:18:23,053
a tent full of
rookie Australians out here.

388
00:18:23,166 --> 00:18:24,141
I'm gonna be sick.

389
00:18:24,394 --> 00:18:26,007
You got this. You're the one.

390
00:18:26,273 --> 00:18:27,633
- Why you got to say that?
- Okay?

391
00:18:27,674 --> 00:18:29,081
You've done this
a million times.

392
00:18:29,135 --> 00:18:30,956
And so have you.
You know, you just jinxed it.

393
00:18:32,605 --> 00:18:33,405
You just jinxed it!

394
00:18:33,430 --> 00:18:35,252
<i>Hey, Dan, I need the driver
in the car now, please.</i>

395
00:18:35,277 --> 00:18:36,221
- Okay, the tide's coming up.
- Okay.

396
00:18:36,246 --> 00:18:37,641
Thank you so much.
Appreciate you.

397
00:18:37,761 --> 00:18:39,414
- Is that Jody?
- Yes, it's Jody.

398
00:18:41,399 --> 00:18:42,555
She say something about me?

399
00:18:43,133 --> 00:18:44,875
Stop with-- your face.
Stop it.

400
00:18:44,993 --> 00:18:45,579
Stop it.

401
00:18:46,006 --> 00:18:47,594
She didn't say
anything about you.

402
00:18:48,261 --> 00:18:49,548
Get in the car!

403
00:18:53,213 --> 00:18:54,725
This is really important to her.

404
00:18:54,750 --> 00:18:56,118
Yes, it's important to her.

405
00:18:56,359 --> 00:18:58,192
- Is this Comic-Con or something?
- Hall H.

406
00:18:59,566 --> 00:19:01,245
"This is one of those times,

407
00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:04,612
whether it's an inch or a mile,
a win is a win."

408
00:19:07,066 --> 00:19:08,500
That's easy.
<i>Fast and the Furious.</i>

409
00:19:10,139 --> 00:19:10,972
Let's go.

410
00:19:11,605 --> 00:19:13,672
- You got this.
- Did you see the coffee lady?

411
00:19:13,697 --> 00:19:14,595
She was wearing, like, a hat.

412
00:19:14,642 --> 00:19:16,002
- I see you in the car.
- Okay.

413
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:20,066
This is the hero set.

414
00:19:20,091 --> 00:19:22,031
I got five more after that.
Are you ready, Dan?

415
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:23,113
- Yeah?
- Rock and roll.

416
00:19:23,138 --> 00:19:23,960
Lock it up!

417
00:19:25,133 --> 00:19:26,100
Thank you.

418
00:19:28,068 --> 00:19:30,301
<i>Okay, folks. he's buckled in.
Stunts are ready.</i>

419
00:19:30,326 --> 00:19:31,400
<i>Godspeed, Colt.</i>

420
00:19:33,566 --> 00:19:34,955
<i>All right, FX...</i>

421
00:19:34,979 --> 00:19:35,428
<i>go high.</i>

422
00:19:35,453 --> 00:19:37,320
<i>FX, please go hot on the cannon.</i>

423
00:19:38,246 --> 00:19:40,166
<i>Okay, engaging the cannon now.</i>

424
00:19:41,566 --> 00:19:42,799
<i>Charging the cannon.</i>

425
00:19:42,899 --> 00:19:45,493
<i>2,000 PSI in the cannon.</i>

426
00:19:45,933 --> 00:19:48,166
- Stunts is good.
- Cannon is hot.

427
00:19:50,128 --> 00:19:52,034
Cameras, where are we at?
Are you rolling? Camera one?

428
00:19:52,059 --> 00:19:53,521
- Speed on one.
- Camera two?

429
00:20:22,866 --> 00:20:25,779
<i>And three, two, one.</i>

430
00:20:25,804 --> 00:20:27,300
<i>Action, action, action!</i>

431
00:20:32,966 --> 00:20:35,866
- All right, guys, stay frosty.
- <i>Three, two, one!</i>

432
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:44,647
Dan, I need him close to the
camera now.

433
00:20:45,041 --> 00:20:46,007
<i>Copy that!</i>

434
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,366
<i>Look,
I don't want to be that guy,</i>

435
00:20:48,366 --> 00:20:49,900
<i>but the sand's a little loose.</i>

436
00:20:50,339 --> 00:20:51,806
<i>I can't get any traction.</i>

437
00:20:52,133 --> 00:20:53,160
<i>When I do, it jumps, so...</i>

438
00:20:53,184 --> 00:20:54,285
if you get any closer,

439
00:20:54,367 --> 00:20:55,553
you're gonna lose the camera.

440
00:20:56,591 --> 00:20:58,441
I know, I know,
but get in there.

441
00:20:58,466 --> 00:20:59,533
<i>You got this, baby!</i>

442
00:20:59,533 --> 00:21:00,566
Move up, move up.

443
00:21:02,207 --> 00:21:04,300
No, no, not that close.
Oh. What the--

444
00:21:05,875 --> 00:21:07,708
<i>Keep rolling.
We have seven more cameras.</i>

445
00:21:07,733 --> 00:21:09,466
- <i>Keep rolling!</i>
- Okay!

446
00:21:09,766 --> 00:21:12,866
Ready in
<i>three, two, one!</i>

447
00:21:48,944 --> 00:21:49,868
You alright?
You alright?

448
00:21:49,902 --> 00:21:50,609
Quickly, get him.

449
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:51,700
Come on, get out.

450
00:21:52,918 --> 00:21:54,251
Are you good?

451
00:21:54,426 --> 00:21:55,414
Colt, you did it!

452
00:21:56,207 --> 00:21:57,633
Eight and a half rolls!

453
00:21:57,980 --> 00:21:59,700
Come on, you okay? You good?

454
00:22:00,060 --> 00:22:00,626
You good?

455
00:22:04,032 --> 00:22:06,299
- Jody's coming. Hold on.
- Okay.

456
00:22:06,933 --> 00:22:08,366
So good, Dan. Is he good?

457
00:22:08,568 --> 00:22:09,675
- Yeah, of course.
- So good, so good.

458
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:10,676
Loved it, loved it.

459
00:22:11,110 --> 00:22:12,150
- Incredible.
- Okay.

460
00:22:22,806 --> 00:22:23,870
Whose idea was this?

461
00:22:25,166 --> 00:22:26,933
I think it was Gail's idea.

462
00:22:26,933 --> 00:22:27,863
I thought it was your idea.

463
00:22:27,888 --> 00:22:30,045
I just found out
about this yesterday.

464
00:22:30,198 --> 00:22:31,031
Dan, come on.

465
00:22:31,558 --> 00:22:32,825
I didn't approve him.

466
00:22:33,366 --> 00:22:35,488
I didn't approve him.
I would never have approved him.

467
00:22:35,933 --> 00:22:37,166
She didn't approve me.

468
00:22:37,225 --> 00:22:38,151
Can I talk to you for a second?

469
00:22:38,176 --> 00:22:38,955
I'm not approved.

470
00:22:38,980 --> 00:22:39,822
Interesting move.

471
00:22:39,966 --> 00:22:41,987
Really, really interesting.

472
00:22:42,034 --> 00:22:43,789
Just very casual.

473
00:22:44,261 --> 00:22:47,400
Here you are, you show up,
and, "I'm your new stuntman."

474
00:22:59,766 --> 00:23:01,994
- Don't do that. You can't do that.
- What?

475
00:23:02,019 --> 00:23:04,432
- I'm directing a movie.
- Your hat's coming off.

476
00:23:06,979 --> 00:23:07,713
Why are you here?

477
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:09,442
I think there's been
a misunderstanding.

478
00:23:09,469 --> 00:23:10,069
Clearly.

479
00:23:10,272 --> 00:23:12,539
Because I was under
the impression that...

480
00:23:14,466 --> 00:23:15,614
...you did want me here.

481
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:18,108
That's a delusional thought.
We haven't spoken in a year.

482
00:23:18,266 --> 00:23:19,532
- Let's not get into it.
- Gail, Gail-- But Gail

483
00:23:19,559 --> 00:23:20,270
- told me that you
- Okay. Whatever.

484
00:23:20,295 --> 00:23:21,254
- wanted me here.
I don't even care about it,

485
00:23:21,281 --> 00:23:22,181
but you clipped the camera.

486
00:23:22,246 --> 00:23:24,444
I'm a little rusty.

487
00:23:24,678 --> 00:23:26,491
- Comic-Con shot ruined.
- I'm sor-- I know.

488
00:23:26,624 --> 00:23:27,600
- Hall H.
- Yeah.

489
00:23:27,691 --> 00:23:28,697
- It's a big deal.
- Yeah.

490
00:23:29,118 --> 00:23:30,298
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

491
00:23:31,351 --> 00:23:32,358
I'm happy for you.

492
00:23:35,780 --> 00:23:37,766
This whole director thing
looks good on you.

493
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:40,383
Even the gardening hat, somehow.

494
00:23:40,957 --> 00:23:43,200
Everyone wears them.
It's like a set thing.

495
00:23:44,733 --> 00:23:46,068
- Okay?
- Yeah, I see it. It's--

496
00:23:46,235 --> 00:23:48,175
They're not making it look
as good as you are, that's all.

497
00:23:48,435 --> 00:23:50,669
And I'm not trying to be fla--
I'm just saying the facts.

498
00:23:51,272 --> 00:23:52,672
But you look good in everything.

499
00:23:52,900 --> 00:23:54,400
You look good in nothing.
Whatever.

500
00:23:55,255 --> 00:23:56,683
- No, I don't mean it like that.
- Really?

501
00:23:56,870 --> 00:23:58,338
- But you do look good in nothing.
- This isn't... This isn't work--

502
00:23:58,363 --> 00:23:59,671
- This isn't gonna work.
- I mean, you do.

503
00:23:59,719 --> 00:24:00,572
But it's not what I...

504
00:24:04,166 --> 00:24:05,999
- I'll take anyone. Anyone else.
- Yeah.

505
00:24:06,206 --> 00:24:08,173
- Anyone but him.
- Can I be honest with you?

506
00:24:08,300 --> 00:24:10,266
We literally have no one else.

507
00:24:11,275 --> 00:24:12,033
What's next?

508
00:24:12,499 --> 00:24:13,560
The fire burn.

509
00:24:15,486 --> 00:24:16,665
It's your call.

510
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:19,366
- Okay.
- Can we get a nurse on standby, please?

511
00:24:19,410 --> 00:24:21,000
We're gonna set
this man on fire.

512
00:24:38,684 --> 00:24:39,624
Cut, cut, cut.

513
00:24:39,778 --> 00:24:40,866
Cutting there, please.

514
00:24:46,046 --> 00:24:47,646
<i>How you feeling, Colt Seavers?</i>

515
00:24:47,733 --> 00:24:49,466
- He's good.
- We're gonna go again.

516
00:24:49,533 --> 00:24:50,866
Thumbs-up, okay?

517
00:24:51,333 --> 00:24:53,141
Technical issue.
Little bump on the dolly.

518
00:24:53,334 --> 00:24:54,643
- Huh?
- Can you fix that, Jimmy?

519
00:24:54,926 --> 00:24:56,193
- Back to ones, please.
- Thank you.

520
00:24:58,466 --> 00:25:00,700
Colt, do you feel a bit
flung into the deep end here?

521
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:02,222
I'm just wondering, 'cause
you haven't read the script,

522
00:25:02,344 --> 00:25:03,955
if you'd like some backstory,
some context?

523
00:25:04,068 --> 00:25:04,841
Would that be good?

524
00:25:04,988 --> 00:25:06,514
- Just go with it.
- Yeah, helpful?

525
00:25:06,666 --> 00:25:07,833
Okay. Here we go.

526
00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:10,575
So, sci-fi love story,
two characters,

527
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:13,866
one of them's an alien--
Aliena-- and you're Space Cowboy.

528
00:25:13,966 --> 00:25:15,707
They shared what's called
a moon season.

529
00:25:16,374 --> 00:25:18,589
In real life,
you might call it a fling.

530
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:21,312
Um, brief but very intense.

531
00:25:21,979 --> 00:25:23,899
And... hopeful.

532
00:25:26,119 --> 00:25:28,268
Now, neither of them
had ever been in a relationship

533
00:25:28,292 --> 00:25:29,425
that deep before.

534
00:25:29,858 --> 00:25:32,778
And they told each other that
over and over and over again.

535
00:25:32,891 --> 00:25:33,884
Him more than her,

536
00:25:33,909 --> 00:25:35,544
you know, to the point
where sometimes she was like,

537
00:25:35,666 --> 00:25:36,900
"Chill out," you know.

538
00:25:37,133 --> 00:25:38,931
But anyway,
in a tragic turn of events,

539
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:44,110
Space Cowboy is wounded,
and he just disappears.

540
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:46,866
Without a trace.

541
00:25:52,866 --> 00:25:55,267
- <i>I can keep going.</i>
- I can hit the rock better now, thanks.

542
00:25:56,333 --> 00:25:57,370
We're going again!

543
00:26:00,090 --> 00:26:01,164
Sound speed.

544
00:26:02,017 --> 00:26:03,257
And action!

545
00:26:07,300 --> 00:26:08,290
That's a cut!

546
00:26:08,456 --> 00:26:09,323
Cutting there, please.

547
00:26:12,634 --> 00:26:13,967
- <i>Everything okay?</i>
- You good?

548
00:26:14,179 --> 00:26:15,901
For a little more context, Colt,

549
00:26:16,321 --> 00:26:18,192
Eliana sort of devastated.

550
00:26:18,733 --> 00:26:20,153
And she starts sort of
replaying everything

551
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:21,740
in her head over and over again.

552
00:26:21,940 --> 00:26:23,340
Did she misread the vibe?

553
00:26:23,472 --> 00:26:24,906
Was it just a fling?

554
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,407
Did she let her imagination
run wild again?

555
00:26:28,133 --> 00:26:29,386
Or did he lie to her?

556
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:31,566
Was he full of shit?

557
00:26:34,259 --> 00:26:37,364
But let me be clear, eventually,
Eliana did move on.

558
00:26:37,633 --> 00:26:38,433
All right?

559
00:26:40,133 --> 00:26:41,933
And she started doing Pilates.

560
00:26:42,766 --> 00:26:44,700
Got herself
a banging revenge body,

561
00:26:45,486 --> 00:26:47,081
and then she started dating
other humans.

562
00:26:48,053 --> 00:26:49,318
One after another.

563
00:26:49,743 --> 00:26:51,553
And she had
so many mind-blowing,

564
00:26:51,700 --> 00:26:54,994
far superior experiences,
you wouldn't even believe it.

565
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:56,827
Right, girls?
You know what I mean?

566
00:26:57,866 --> 00:26:59,629
Yeah, it was like a sushi train.

567
00:27:00,653 --> 00:27:01,488
I'm gonna be sick.

568
00:27:01,895 --> 00:27:03,626
And do you know what?
We're gonna go again, Colt,

569
00:27:03,691 --> 00:27:05,123
'cause there was
a little buzz on that one.

570
00:27:05,325 --> 00:27:06,598
Okay, light him up.

571
00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:09,766
Last one, everybody. Action!

572
00:27:14,133 --> 00:27:15,733
It-It's just feeling
so withheld,

573
00:27:15,779 --> 00:27:17,599
so how 'bout some dialogue?

574
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:18,882
Yeah, that's all right, Darla.

575
00:27:18,906 --> 00:27:20,067
I'm gonna go
straight to the source.

576
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:24,039
Hey, Colt, if Space Cowboy
had to say something,

577
00:27:24,064 --> 00:27:25,841
if he was forced to say something

578
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:26,956
what would he say?

579
00:27:27,665 --> 00:27:28,757
How would he justify

580
00:27:28,795 --> 00:27:30,485
this year she's spent
spinning out over this?

581
00:27:30,519 --> 00:27:32,061
What could he say?
It's a puzzler, isn't it?

582
00:27:32,086 --> 00:27:34,209
- But have you got any thoughts?
- Uh, maybe he could talk...

583
00:27:34,234 --> 00:27:35,853
Nigel, can you, can you
get him a bullhorn?

584
00:27:35,878 --> 00:27:36,711
I can't hear him.

585
00:27:38,419 --> 00:27:39,219
Traveling.

586
00:27:48,506 --> 00:27:49,589
Come again, Colt.
What was that?

587
00:27:49,643 --> 00:27:50,670
It's already on.

588
00:27:50,866 --> 00:27:51,837
In this movie,

589
00:27:52,404 --> 00:27:54,666
do the aliens and
the humans ever talk...

590
00:27:55,966 --> 00:27:57,000
in private?

591
00:27:58,639 --> 00:28:00,752
- No, not really.
- No private conversations?

592
00:28:00,886 --> 00:28:02,234
No, they don't like
doing private.

593
00:28:02,259 --> 00:28:04,659
Like, they like to keep it very public.
Very open.

594
00:28:07,166 --> 00:28:08,000
Well...

595
00:28:08,499 --> 00:28:10,827
maybe I'll just, uh,
open it up to the group here.

596
00:28:12,039 --> 00:28:14,506
Have you ever been in one of
those situations where...

597
00:28:15,919 --> 00:28:18,274
...you want to say something
and it's so important

598
00:28:18,421 --> 00:28:19,666
that you can't mess it up?

599
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:21,076
So...

600
00:28:22,115 --> 00:28:23,895
you think
long and hard about it,

601
00:28:24,879 --> 00:28:25,979
and then you realize...

602
00:28:27,533 --> 00:28:29,099
you've already messed it up?

603
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,424
'Cause you've thought too long

604
00:28:32,257 --> 00:28:33,833
and too hard about it?

605
00:28:35,074 --> 00:28:35,834
You're...

606
00:28:36,866 --> 00:28:37,700
What's that?

607
00:28:39,465 --> 00:28:40,265
You want...

608
00:28:46,266 --> 00:28:47,658
I had a similar situation

609
00:28:47,683 --> 00:28:49,921
when I fell in love
with my wife's sister.

610
00:28:50,045 --> 00:28:51,856
- Okay. All right. What...
- No.

611
00:28:51,881 --> 00:28:52,681
Okay.

612
00:28:55,566 --> 00:28:57,081
And again, this
is hard because...

613
00:28:58,201 --> 00:28:59,700
you know, I haven't
read the script.

614
00:29:00,166 --> 00:29:00,966
But...

615
00:29:03,666 --> 00:29:05,233
...he'd probably say...

616
00:29:07,366 --> 00:29:08,866
...that he's been living...

617
00:29:11,666 --> 00:29:13,800
...in total regret since then.

618
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:16,566
You know, afraid...

619
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:20,303
that he'll never get
an opportunity to make it up to her...

620
00:29:22,439 --> 00:29:23,861
...because he waited too long.

621
00:29:24,662 --> 00:29:25,515
And...

622
00:29:28,466 --> 00:29:29,766
...she's probably moved on.

623
00:29:30,505 --> 00:29:31,575
Uh, sorry, Jody,

624
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:33,500
speaking of moving on,
we, uh...

625
00:29:36,185 --> 00:29:36,985
One more?

626
00:29:42,933 --> 00:29:44,300
I'd love another chance.

627
00:29:48,612 --> 00:29:50,563
- Roll it, Nigel.
- Let's turn over, please!

628
00:29:50,603 --> 00:29:52,764
- All cameras are rolling.
- Shot's up, sound speeding.

629
00:29:52,804 --> 00:29:53,611
Okay, light him up!

630
00:29:56,496 --> 00:29:57,956
Action! Thank you!

631
00:30:05,166 --> 00:30:05,966
Gail.

632
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:09,300
Gail.

633
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:12,633
Coffee.

634
00:30:21,706 --> 00:30:23,139
Mm! You're here.

635
00:30:23,166 --> 00:30:24,591
Oh, no, don't use that.
It's broken.

636
00:30:24,900 --> 00:30:26,573
Eight and a half rolls?

637
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,688
That is a world record!

638
00:30:30,300 --> 00:30:32,307
Thank you so much.

639
00:30:33,300 --> 00:30:35,325
It's better than parking cars,
isn't it?

640
00:30:38,133 --> 00:30:39,233
Would you cut the shit, Gail?

641
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:41,240
What? It was amazing.
What are you talking about?

642
00:30:41,332 --> 00:30:43,244
She doesn't want me here, Gail.

643
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:44,633
Yes, she does.

644
00:30:44,925 --> 00:30:47,392
- Oh, of course she does.
- You lied.

645
00:30:48,231 --> 00:30:49,211
You lied.

646
00:30:49,366 --> 00:30:51,086
- Colt.
- Do you know how that feels?

647
00:30:51,215 --> 00:30:51,975
Come on.

648
00:30:52,533 --> 00:30:54,300
Sit down chill your beans.

649
00:30:55,579 --> 00:30:57,520
How many memories
have we got doing this?

650
00:30:57,793 --> 00:30:59,059
You and me back here...

651
00:30:59,286 --> 00:31:00,693
all of those movies?

652
00:31:01,866 --> 00:31:03,559
14, 15 movies...

653
00:31:03,717 --> 00:31:05,111
we've done together now was like...

654
00:31:05,477 --> 00:31:06,904
a decade of our lives.

655
00:31:07,190 --> 00:31:08,930
- You do Last Time for Murder.
- Yeah.

656
00:31:09,186 --> 00:31:10,708
But, you know, Ryder

657
00:31:10,733 --> 00:31:12,066
he can be a bit of a kind of...

658
00:31:12,212 --> 00:31:13,154
methody...

659
00:31:13,513 --> 00:31:14,399
twat face.

660
00:31:14,666 --> 00:31:16,587
But you know what, people change.

661
00:31:16,927 --> 00:31:18,834
You know my mom's version
of a good night kiss?

662
00:31:18,900 --> 00:31:20,916
I'm not kidding. Smacking the chops.

663
00:31:21,646 --> 00:31:23,913
Knock me out cold. I forgave her.

664
00:31:24,585 --> 00:31:26,646
We can all change, Colt. We can evolve-

665
00:31:26,671 --> 00:31:28,180
- Look what you did to Jody.
- Huh?

666
00:31:28,893 --> 00:31:30,744
You run out, you disappear.

667
00:31:30,886 --> 00:31:32,219
You're not in contact with her.

668
00:31:32,266 --> 00:31:33,414
- I mean...
- Honestly.

669
00:31:33,499 --> 00:31:34,672
- I was in the hospital.
- She was...

670
00:31:34,993 --> 00:31:35,826
I appreciate that.

671
00:31:35,851 --> 00:31:36,725
But it was brutal.

672
00:31:36,750 --> 00:31:37,565
- Horrendous.
- It wasn't magic trick...

673
00:31:37,612 --> 00:31:39,105
- She was devastated.
- I didn't disappear.

674
00:31:39,350 --> 00:31:41,710
Yes, you should feel bad
but you can make it right.

675
00:31:41,966 --> 00:31:44,725
It's, like, the message
in all my movies.

676
00:31:44,883 --> 00:31:45,743
You know that, right?

677
00:31:45,849 --> 00:31:47,309
What's the message
in all my movies?

678
00:31:49,766 --> 00:31:52,433
Nihilism's a viable worldview?

679
00:31:53,606 --> 00:31:56,340
No, that's just
the entertainment.

680
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:57,212
That's like the...

681
00:31:58,292 --> 00:32:00,194
 like the sexy bacon.

682
00:32:00,506 --> 00:32:02,106
- What is this?
- You know? It's like dogs.

683
00:32:02,239 --> 00:32:04,048
You got to wrap the message...

684
00:32:04,955 --> 00:32:06,776
in some sexy bacon.

685
00:32:07,933 --> 00:32:10,508
I mean, all those movies,
people fall down.

686
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:11,928
They're rolling
in their own shit.

687
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,594
They don't think they can cope,
but they can. They get back up.

688
00:32:14,733 --> 00:32:15,900
Do you mind if I lay down?

689
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:19,550
With the multiple fire burns
and the cannon rolls

690
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:21,712
- and the jet lag, I just...
- Yep, yep.

691
00:32:21,933 --> 00:32:23,817
...could use a little shut-eye.

692
00:32:23,886 --> 00:32:24,364
Yep.

693
00:32:24,704 --> 00:32:26,117
Okay, let me get this straight.

694
00:32:27,297 --> 00:32:29,433
Nihilism is the sexy bacon?

695
00:32:29,659 --> 00:32:31,038
- Yeah
- The audience...

696
00:32:31,451 --> 00:32:32,138
are dogs?

697
00:32:32,333 --> 00:32:33,086
There we go.

698
00:32:33,433 --> 00:32:35,112
And when you fall down,

699
00:32:35,745 --> 00:32:36,619
you get back up.

700
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:38,951
- Thank you.
- I'm glad we did this.

701
00:32:39,146 --> 00:32:39,711
Now,

702
00:32:40,010 --> 00:32:41,766
what am I really
doing here, Gail?

703
00:32:46,100 --> 00:32:47,192
Ryder's missing.

704
00:32:47,366 --> 00:32:51,333
He has fallen in with some shady,
shitty, shitty people.

705
00:32:51,733 --> 00:32:53,040
Well, Gail...

706
00:32:54,966 --> 00:32:55,695
...call the cops.

707
00:32:56,266 --> 00:32:57,557
I can't call the cops.

708
00:32:57,704 --> 00:32:58,879
Well, why not?

709
00:32:58,903 --> 00:33:01,390
The studio will know
that I am way over budget.

710
00:33:02,066 --> 00:33:05,000
They will pull the plug on this.
You know that

711
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:07,426
Please go and find him.

712
00:33:07,523 --> 00:33:08,297
Why me?

713
00:33:08,646 --> 00:33:10,718
You're a stuntman,
for God's sake.

714
00:33:10,859 --> 00:33:13,115
No one's gonna notice
whether you're here or not.

715
00:33:13,266 --> 00:33:15,421
- No offense.
- I mean, some taken.

716
00:33:15,506 --> 00:33:17,634
You know him intimately.

717
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,283
It can be so simple.

718
00:33:19,448 --> 00:33:20,477
You pick him up,

719
00:33:20,885 --> 00:33:21,817
you dust him off, you

720
00:33:22,211 --> 00:33:23,231
you bring him back here.

721
00:33:23,519 --> 00:33:24,879
I know I can trust you.

722
00:33:24,993 --> 00:33:26,514
And you know who can
trust you more than anyone,

723
00:33:26,539 --> 00:33:28,774
she just doesn't
realize it yet, is Jody.

724
00:33:29,585 --> 00:33:31,512
This is her big chance.

725
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:34,820
Do you want her first movie
to be her last?

726
00:33:35,713 --> 00:33:37,247
You've got to help me out, man.

727
00:33:38,826 --> 00:33:40,559
It's been a long couple days.

728
00:33:41,533 --> 00:33:43,066
I'm gonna go to the hotel,

729
00:33:44,304 --> 00:33:45,070
I'm gonna--
What is it?

730
00:33:45,095 --> 00:33:45,828
It's my...

731
00:33:46,421 --> 00:33:48,041
yesterday, it's your tomor--

732
00:33:48,066 --> 00:33:48,857
I'm gonna call you

733
00:33:48,881 --> 00:33:49,455
- your tomorrow.
- Right, no.

734
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:50,283
- Today.
- My today.

735
00:33:50,335 --> 00:33:52,108
That is the door code
of Ryder's loft.

736
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:54,167
The patio door.
Took it from his trailer.

737
00:33:54,266 --> 00:33:55,635
He's still doing
this Post-it note thing?

738
00:33:57,146 --> 00:33:58,292
Let's not even get into that.

739
00:33:58,317 --> 00:34:00,715
At this point,
it's like <i>Memento</i> level.

740
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:02,933
I can only keep this from Jody

741
00:34:02,933 --> 00:34:05,167
and the studio 48 hours max.

742
00:34:05,766 --> 00:34:07,066
Save Jody's movie,

743
00:34:07,473 --> 00:34:09,370
and maybe you get
the love of your life back.

744
00:34:11,540 --> 00:34:13,758
Did you just turn Jody
into the sexy bacon?

745
00:34:14,300 --> 00:34:16,400
She's been
the sexy bacon all along.

746
00:34:17,633 --> 00:34:18,310
You're good.

747
00:34:18,796 --> 00:34:20,343
It's the only left-hand drive I have.

748
00:34:22,606 --> 00:34:24,606
Please don't wreck it.
It's product placement.

749
00:34:24,712 --> 00:34:25,845
There's only two of them.

750
00:34:27,300 --> 00:34:29,066
I know how you stunties drive.

751
00:34:32,459 --> 00:34:34,893
You seek to destroy
all I hold dear.

752
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:11,500
What are you doing?

753
00:36:12,846 --> 00:36:14,712
Uh, just, uh, chilling down.

754
00:36:14,766 --> 00:36:16,472
Were you "chilling down"
to Taylor Swift?

755
00:36:16,538 --> 00:36:17,198
Yep.

756
00:36:18,733 --> 00:36:20,186
It's just something
Australians say.

757
00:36:20,246 --> 00:36:22,157
Really? I've been here for six
months, I've never heard it.

758
00:36:22,182 --> 00:36:23,745
Yeah, "chilling down under,"
you know,

759
00:36:23,770 --> 00:36:25,654
- but it's shorter to say "chilling down."
- Have you been crying?

760
00:36:26,332 --> 00:36:28,235
- Not at all.
- You look like you've been crying.

761
00:36:29,825 --> 00:36:30,625
Jet lag.

762
00:36:32,973 --> 00:36:34,902
That was so dangerous,
and I'm very sorry.

763
00:36:35,033 --> 00:36:36,228
Lighting you up like that.

764
00:36:36,768 --> 00:36:38,728
It was very cathartic.

765
00:36:39,260 --> 00:36:41,326
- I feel better.
- I deserved it.

766
00:36:43,886 --> 00:36:46,419
I'm gonna make the camera
up to you, by the way.

767
00:36:47,379 --> 00:36:48,945
Can I get in the car with you?

768
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:53,500
Clean your face. You're a mess.

769
00:36:57,266 --> 00:36:58,384
So how have you been?

770
00:36:58,764 --> 00:37:00,264
Oh, you know.

771
00:37:02,666 --> 00:37:03,807
Yeah? Thumbs-up?

772
00:37:03,927 --> 00:37:06,323
God, I hate that bullshit,
that stunt guy bullshit.

773
00:37:08,733 --> 00:37:10,651
And that's fine.
You don't have to explain anything.

774
00:37:10,699 --> 00:37:12,184
It's all good. It was a fling.

775
00:37:12,544 --> 00:37:14,617
Less than a fling. It was
a flingette, and that's fine.

776
00:37:14,863 --> 00:37:16,007
I don't even want to know.

777
00:37:16,186 --> 00:37:17,186
And the problem with

778
00:37:17,239 --> 00:37:18,927
forcing something is you get nowhere.

779
00:37:19,112 --> 00:37:21,312
You know, one time my mom
forced my dad to exercise.

780
00:37:21,366 --> 00:37:22,300
Do you know what happened?

781
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:24,586
Snapped his ankle first time
he stepped on the treadmill.

782
00:37:24,633 --> 00:37:27,033
She forced it, now he has
a piece of metal in his foot.

783
00:37:27,113 --> 00:37:29,246
Moral of the story is
you should just be you.

784
00:37:32,106 --> 00:37:33,906
Well, look, I've thought
a lot about this, actually,

785
00:37:33,931 --> 00:37:34,731
and I, uh...

786
00:37:35,366 --> 00:37:37,130
It's not like
I didn't want to apologize

787
00:37:37,366 --> 00:37:38,677
a million times.

788
00:37:38,790 --> 00:37:39,183
Yeah.

789
00:37:40,033 --> 00:37:41,743
Uh, it's just, every time I...

790
00:37:46,079 --> 00:37:48,045
You know, when I think of
something to say...

791
00:37:52,300 --> 00:37:53,800
...doesn't seem like enough.

792
00:37:58,947 --> 00:37:59,813
Okay.

793
00:38:00,632 --> 00:38:01,458
No problem.

794
00:38:02,338 --> 00:38:04,906
Boundaries. Boundaries.

795
00:38:05,466 --> 00:38:08,315
That's important.
Because I have a lot of pressure on me.

796
00:38:08,741 --> 00:38:11,913
You have no idea how hard it was
for me to make this movie, okay?

797
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:14,335
I just need to focus,
so if you're gonna stay here,

798
00:38:14,466 --> 00:38:15,479
we need to keep it...

799
00:38:16,725 --> 00:38:18,352
like, super profesh.

800
00:38:19,293 --> 00:38:20,759
"Professional"
is my middle name.

801
00:38:24,806 --> 00:38:26,373
I thought your middle name
was "Danger."

802
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:28,066
That's a stage name.

803
00:38:30,826 --> 00:38:32,492
Colt Profesh Seavers.

804
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:40,165
Promise me you're not
gonna derail this, okay?

805
00:38:40,258 --> 00:38:41,085
Promise.

806
00:38:50,832 --> 00:38:52,199
Want to do some doughnuts?

807
00:39:01,466 --> 00:39:03,066
Do you want to drive me
to my car?

808
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:05,400
Yeah.

809
00:39:19,766 --> 00:39:20,966
Okay, goodbye.

810
00:40:15,446 --> 00:40:16,321
Okay.

811
00:40:16,345 --> 00:40:18,346
"Tom, long time no see.

812
00:40:18,766 --> 00:40:20,700
Gail asked me to check
and make sure you're okay."

813
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,166
"Colt, thought you were dead.

814
00:40:25,466 --> 00:40:27,175
Why you got to be
such a pussy bitch?"

815
00:40:27,921 --> 00:40:30,895
"Tom, I'm gonna have to ask you
not to refer to me

816
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:32,735
as a pussy or a bitch."

817
00:40:33,900 --> 00:40:36,010
"Okay, but you got hurt
like a pussy

818
00:40:36,035 --> 00:40:37,036
and you're acting like a bitch."

819
00:40:37,557 --> 00:40:38,303
Tom?

820
00:40:38,923 --> 00:40:41,619
Colt Seavers.
Just checking in on you.

821
00:40:43,166 --> 00:40:45,200
Jody needs you back on set, pal.

822
00:40:47,645 --> 00:40:49,367
And I-I don't want
to be a part of any...

823
00:40:49,590 --> 00:40:51,345
breaking in, role-play games.

824
00:40:58,208 --> 00:40:59,152
Well, all right.

825
00:41:43,932 --> 00:41:44,852
Coffee.

826
00:42:00,333 --> 00:42:01,866
What the...!

827
00:42:31,366 --> 00:42:32,879
Why do you look so familiar?

828
00:42:37,882 --> 00:42:38,889
Where do I know you from?

829
00:42:38,914 --> 00:42:42,214
I'm Iggy Starr,
lead actress on <i>Metalstorm.</i>

830
00:42:44,070 --> 00:42:45,223
- I'm Ryder's girlfriend.
- Oh.

831
00:42:45,248 --> 00:42:46,611
- You're in <i>Metalstorm.</i>
- Yeah.

832
00:42:46,733 --> 00:42:48,115
Hey, were you
in that movie <i>Carjacked</i>

833
00:42:48,140 --> 00:42:49,506
where that guy named Jack
steals your car

834
00:42:49,531 --> 00:42:50,924
and then you shoot him
in the hand and you say,

835
00:42:51,005 --> 00:42:52,433
"I hope you know
how to drive stick"?

836
00:42:53,033 --> 00:42:54,441
And it doesn't make sense
'cause it's like,

837
00:42:54,466 --> 00:42:55,692
should be "automatic,"
but the way you say it...

838
00:42:55,717 --> 00:42:56,954
That's Natalie Portman!

839
00:42:57,859 --> 00:42:59,100
Oh. She's great.

840
00:42:59,605 --> 00:43:01,727
- Is there anything else I'd know you from?
- Storm Chaser.

841
00:43:01,812 --> 00:43:03,565
- No.
- Ice Warrior 1..

842
00:43:04,239 --> 00:43:05,238
Ice Warrior 2.

843
00:43:05,678 --> 00:43:06,812
I didn't see one.

844
00:43:06,879 --> 00:43:08,632
- Back in Manners.
- No.

845
00:43:09,073 --> 00:43:12,252
I got a 17 minutes
standing ovation at Cons.

846
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:13,215
Is it Con?

847
00:43:13,240 --> 00:43:15,069
'Cause it's just like
I thought it was Cans.

848
00:43:20,300 --> 00:43:22,766
I'd love to see you film.
Where is it streaming?

849
00:43:23,266 --> 00:43:24,366
Streaming?

850
00:43:26,326 --> 00:43:27,619
I'm just a stunt guy.

851
00:43:28,086 --> 00:43:29,617
I'm working on
<i>Metalstorm,</i>, too.

852
00:43:29,651 --> 00:43:32,675
You lie!
We're only on <i>Metalstorm 1.</i>

853
00:43:33,021 --> 00:43:34,266
I meant also, though!

854
00:43:53,100 --> 00:43:54,233
Is this a prop sword?

855
00:43:54,753 --> 00:43:55,593
Mm-hmm.

856
00:43:55,952 --> 00:43:57,153
I'm a good actress.

857
00:43:57,859 --> 00:44:00,293
Hey, if you are
really working on <i>Metalstorm,</i>

858
00:44:00,712 --> 00:44:01,946
why are you
sneaking around here?

859
00:44:02,100 --> 00:44:04,065
Just trying to find Ryder.

860
00:44:04,200 --> 00:44:06,373
He's, like, really drugged up
and paranoid right now.

861
00:44:06,466 --> 00:44:07,693
He thinks someone's
trying to kill him.

862
00:44:07,753 --> 00:44:10,330
And I'm like, "If you don't
finish <i>Metalstorm,</i>

863
00:44:10,533 --> 00:44:11,951
I'm gonna kill you myself."

864
00:44:12,200 --> 00:44:13,738
I can think of a million reasons why,

865
00:44:13,763 --> 00:44:16,096
but why does Tom think
someone's trying to kill him?

866
00:44:16,933 --> 00:44:17,496
I don't know.

867
00:44:17,666 --> 00:44:20,046
I mean, all I know there is
some dark shit going on.

868
00:44:20,366 --> 00:44:21,999
And the sooner I can
get out of here the better.

869
00:44:22,239 --> 00:44:26,037
It is killing my high vibes
way of being.

870
00:44:26,266 --> 00:44:30,027
I am a light worker.
I am a person of positivity.

871
00:44:30,166 --> 00:44:31,454
I am a giver.

872
00:44:31,647 --> 00:44:34,798
Did you know that there are
actually people in

873
00:44:34,823 --> 00:44:36,566
the world going through hard things?

874
00:44:36,666 --> 00:44:40,894
Like flood and crime
and there are povos.

875
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:45,273
- What's a povo?
- A poor person like you.

876
00:44:46,766 --> 00:44:47,400
Cool.

877
00:44:48,866 --> 00:44:50,600
Any idea where I could find him?

878
00:44:51,239 --> 00:44:54,006
Uh, you could try this club
he hangs out at.

879
00:44:54,632 --> 00:44:56,460
He's there with his drug
 dealer friend, Doone,

880
00:44:56,566 --> 00:44:58,913
Who has leopard print
tats on his head.

881
00:45:00,733 --> 00:45:02,000
Okay, well...

882
00:45:03,533 --> 00:45:05,900
It's been real.
I'll see you on Saturday.

883
00:45:06,700 --> 00:45:08,366
Do you know the call time, by the way?

884
00:45:08,459 --> 00:45:09,859
6:00am for the Povos.

885
00:45:11,960 --> 00:45:13,726
- Hey, stuntman.
- Yeah?

886
00:45:14,866 --> 00:45:16,866
You never gonna get in looking like that.

887
00:45:20,980 --> 00:45:23,569
- What's with the bird?
- That's Tom Sober, the cockatoo.

888
00:45:23,933 --> 00:45:25,533
They're like sensitive to energy and shit

889
00:45:25,533 --> 00:45:26,992
so if you get high around one of them,

890
00:45:27,166 --> 00:45:28,713
they're like freak out
and they attack you.

891
00:45:30,092 --> 00:45:32,052
So what kind of shit is Tom into now?

892
00:45:32,245 --> 00:45:36,079
He's into this new crazy
Australian shit called Dundee.

893
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:37,125
Dundee?

894
00:45:37,206 --> 00:45:38,639
Yeah, like Crocodile Dundee?

895
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:40,522
It's like you see unicorns and shit

896
00:45:40,547 --> 00:45:42,313
you go like get guided on this tour

897
00:45:42,366 --> 00:45:43,499
and then the unicorns
there, like,

898
00:45:43,579 --> 00:45:44,766
"hello, follow me."

899
00:45:44,819 --> 00:45:47,292
it's like, a little bit weird
but I'm kind of into it.

900
00:45:47,839 --> 00:45:49,033
It's very specific.

901
00:45:49,800 --> 00:45:53,329
What's with your
<i>Miami Vice</i> Stunt Team jacket?

902
00:45:53,559 --> 00:45:54,645
Is it second-hand?

903
00:45:55,666 --> 00:45:57,352
It's first show I ever did.

904
00:45:58,486 --> 00:45:59,926
50 stunts in 15 minutes.

905
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,330
I had to jump a boat
through a ring of fire.

906
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:05,691
I got so good I could do with my
hands tied behind my back, actually.

907
00:46:06,104 --> 00:46:07,710
No one's ever done a stunt like that.

908
00:46:07,774 --> 00:46:08,799
So the poster said.

909
00:46:09,474 --> 00:46:10,101
So...

910
00:46:10,452 --> 00:46:12,086
You're very into yourself, aren't you?

911
00:46:13,906 --> 00:46:15,772
I mean you know,
you did ask.

912
00:46:16,819 --> 00:46:19,405
Alright, so security is super tight
at the club.

913
00:46:19,565 --> 00:46:20,778
You're gonna look the part,

914
00:46:20,932 --> 00:46:23,018
but your best bet at getting in
is acting like Tom.

915
00:46:23,043 --> 00:46:24,110
You know how to do that, don't you?

916
00:46:24,200 --> 00:46:26,400
Yeah, just act like I own everything
and everyone

917
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:27,982
and there's no repercussions
for my actions.

918
00:46:40,266 --> 00:46:50,400
what time we slow together Tom

919
00:46:57,400 --> 00:46:59,433
I do like that yeah

920
00:47:01,600 --> 00:47:04,500
I do like that

921
00:47:10,733 --> 00:47:11,533
you doing

922
00:47:15,516 --> 00:47:18,541
Stuntman! Yeah, yeah, Iggy said
you were gonna come see me.

923
00:47:18,566 --> 00:47:19,500
Sit down, get a drink.

924
00:47:19,500 --> 00:47:20,806
Hey, hey, get him a drink, get him a drink
What do you want?

925
00:47:20,959 --> 00:47:22,261
Oh, no, no, I'm good.

926
00:47:22,286 --> 00:47:23,466
I'm just looking for Ryder.

927
00:47:24,459 --> 00:47:26,059
Get him a Shirley Temple.
Sit down.

928
00:47:26,679 --> 00:47:28,932
No offense, I just want to find Ryder.

929
00:47:30,079 --> 00:47:32,345
How come no one ever wants
to chat with the drug dealer?

930
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:38,166
Sorry. I, uh...

931
00:47:39,100 --> 00:47:40,166
I mean no...

932
00:47:40,533 --> 00:47:42,731
no disrespect.
Just had a long day.

933
00:47:42,866 --> 00:47:44,257
Ryder hasn't shown up to work.

934
00:47:44,343 --> 00:47:45,103
That was fast.

935
00:47:45,436 --> 00:47:46,459
You do a stunt today?

936
00:47:46,933 --> 00:47:48,490
I just, uhh, yeah, car roll.

937
00:47:48,603 --> 00:47:49,866
Just a car roll?

938
00:47:49,891 --> 00:47:52,244
Hear how he said that?
"Just a car roll!"

939
00:47:52,269 --> 00:47:54,512
What a stuntman! My man!

940
00:47:54,766 --> 00:47:55,552
It's what I do.

941
00:47:55,577 --> 00:47:56,592
Hey, that's why I like you.

942
00:47:56,800 --> 00:47:57,966
'Cause you do all the hard shit.

943
00:47:58,993 --> 00:48:00,326
They give Oscars for that?

944
00:48:01,206 --> 00:48:02,293
For stunts?

945
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:03,800
No.

946
00:48:05,172 --> 00:48:05,878
Nope.

947
00:48:06,286 --> 00:48:07,819
Hey, to the unsung heroes.

948
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:10,600
- I'll drink to that.
- Yeah.

949
00:48:14,733 --> 00:48:16,720
No offense,
but I prefer cartoons.

950
00:48:16,806 --> 00:48:19,479
See, movies are always trying
to make things real.

951
00:48:20,065 --> 00:48:21,865
But it's not real.
It's a movie.

952
00:48:21,890 --> 00:48:23,224
It's not meant to be real.

953
00:48:24,133 --> 00:48:25,500
That's why I like cartoons.

954
00:48:25,500 --> 00:48:27,868
See, 'cause cartoons
don't pretend to be real.

955
00:48:29,566 --> 00:48:31,666
That's what I like about them.
You seen <i>Dumbo?</i>

956
00:48:31,719 --> 00:48:33,093
<i>- Dumbo?</i>
- Yeah, <i>Dumbo.</i>

957
00:48:33,186 --> 00:48:34,520
<i>Dumbo</i> changed my life.

958
00:48:35,092 --> 00:48:37,223
You know that scene when Dumbo
gets into the bad champagne,

959
00:48:37,248 --> 00:48:38,387
then he starts seeing
the pink elephants

960
00:48:38,412 --> 00:48:39,353
on parade and shit?

961
00:48:39,466 --> 00:48:40,966
I was like, "Yes, please.

962
00:48:41,066 --> 00:48:43,399
"I'll have what he's having!
Make it a double!"

963
00:48:44,966 --> 00:48:46,100
Hey, stuntman?

964
00:48:47,100 --> 00:48:48,266
Why don't you come with us?

965
00:48:48,482 --> 00:48:51,100
We'll get you nice and
comfortable at the hotel, huh?

966
00:49:37,330 --> 00:49:39,299
Get out the way!
Move! C'mon!

967
00:49:51,893 --> 00:49:52,800
Where's Ryder?

968
00:49:52,853 --> 00:49:53,720
Yo, speak louder!

969
00:49:53,866 --> 00:49:55,600
I'm too high for this shit!

970
00:49:59,919 --> 00:50:01,766
<i>Hey, over here!</i>

971
00:50:03,266 --> 00:50:04,900
<i>Yeah! Follow me!</i>

972
00:50:29,226 --> 00:50:30,759
<i>Don't give up, Colt.</i>

973
00:50:36,077 --> 00:50:37,397
<i>Come on.</i>

974
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:39,633
<i>I know where I am.</i>

975
00:50:40,377 --> 00:50:41,104
Hei!

976
00:50:41,128 --> 00:50:42,150
Where is he?

977
00:50:42,697 --> 00:50:44,077
Where's Ryder!

978
00:50:48,766 --> 00:50:49,966
Where's Ryder?!

979
00:50:50,001 --> 00:50:50,601
Speak louder!

980
00:50:50,721 --> 00:50:51,767
- Where is he?
- Huh?

981
00:50:51,801 --> 00:50:53,368
<i>I'm crazy, but...</i>

982
00:50:54,558 --> 00:50:56,058
<i>I think I wanna be...</i>

983
00:51:01,266 --> 00:51:03,866
<i>I think I wanna be a unicorn.</i>

984
00:51:47,366 --> 00:51:49,916
<i>Look at that shiny white coat.</i>

985
00:51:50,556 --> 00:51:53,433
<i>Look at that dreamy metal horn.</i>

986
00:51:54,733 --> 00:51:57,233
<i>Now be your unicorn.</i>

987
00:52:17,994 --> 00:52:19,166
What are you doing, Colt?

988
00:52:19,700 --> 00:52:22,266
You know what I'm doing.
I'm gonna stop this car.

989
00:52:24,590 --> 00:52:26,529
Done 100 times to keep
my hips by the hood.

990
00:52:26,821 --> 00:52:27,632
Should be fine.

991
00:52:27,657 --> 00:52:29,395
You're just doing it
because the unicorn told you to.

992
00:52:29,420 --> 00:52:31,653
You're just jealous the unicorn
didn't talk to you.

993
00:52:32,213 --> 00:52:33,626
You know what?
You're clearly high, Colt.

994
00:52:33,653 --> 00:52:35,286
And you're clearly checkingshit!

995
00:52:36,366 --> 00:52:37,800
We don't have time for this.
Talk about this later.

996
00:52:46,255 --> 00:52:46,881
Yeah, okay.

997
00:52:46,906 --> 00:52:48,007
Driver, what are you doing?

998
00:52:48,035 --> 00:52:48,728
Drive!

999
00:52:49,045 --> 00:52:50,174
Drive, bro!

1000
00:52:50,314 --> 00:52:52,133
Hey, you need to chill.
Just relax. Just re--

1001
00:52:52,133 --> 00:52:53,683
Hey, just relax! I'm a lover,
not a fighter, okay? Just...

1002
00:52:53,708 --> 00:52:54,475
Where's Ryder?!

1003
00:52:54,533 --> 00:52:55,882
I just drugged you 'cause they paid me to.

1004
00:52:55,936 --> 00:52:56,523
Who's "they"?

1005
00:52:57,450 --> 00:52:59,074
The guy that runs
Ryder's security.

1006
00:52:59,133 --> 00:53:00,621
He's into some real shady shit.

1007
00:53:00,659 --> 00:53:01,959
What kind of shady shit?

1008
00:53:02,066 --> 00:53:03,959
- You know...
- What kind of shady shit?

1009
00:53:04,100 --> 00:53:04,985
Shady shit, you know...

1010
00:53:05,010 --> 00:53:07,310
You said shady thing.
Did not tell me what it is.

1011
00:53:07,566 --> 00:53:08,500
Tell me what shady shit is!

1012
00:53:08,579 --> 00:53:10,271
- Different types of shady shit.
- Like what?

1013
00:53:10,366 --> 00:53:12,400
I deliver drugs to him at
the Pennelton Hotel sometimes, okay?

1014
00:53:12,400 --> 00:53:13,332
What room?

1015
00:53:13,357 --> 00:53:14,412
I don't know what room.

1016
00:53:14,437 --> 00:53:15,337
You know, it changes.

1017
00:53:15,499 --> 00:53:16,417
Just ask Kevin for the--

1018
00:53:16,442 --> 00:53:17,710
- for the fruit plate. He'll give you the key.
- Kevin?

1019
00:53:17,919 --> 00:53:20,138
- Kevin! K-E-V-I-N.
- I know Kevin!

1020
00:53:20,392 --> 00:53:21,012
You know Kevin?

1021
00:53:21,037 --> 00:53:23,733
- I don't know Kevin.
- Well, you're gonna get to know Kevin.

1022
00:53:23,733 --> 00:53:24,333
Okay, he's in love-

1023
00:53:24,333 --> 00:53:25,739
I don't wanna get to know Kevin!

1024
00:53:25,926 --> 00:53:27,160
Ask him for a fruit plate.

1025
00:53:28,333 --> 00:53:30,308
Look, I'm not lying to you.
It's a fruit plate.

1026
00:53:30,814 --> 00:53:32,181
It's a fruit plate, are you serious?

1027
00:53:32,294 --> 00:53:34,087
Yeah, you know, mango strawberry
or fruit plate.

1028
00:53:34,112 --> 00:53:36,760
I know what a fruit plate is, sir.

1029
00:53:37,200 --> 00:53:39,611
Then ask Kevin for a fruit plate,
and he'll give you keys.

1030
00:53:40,965 --> 00:53:42,165
How long does this last?

1031
00:53:42,266 --> 00:53:43,878
- What?
- How long is this gonna last?

1032
00:53:43,903 --> 00:53:45,184
- Bro, what are you even saying?
- How...

1033
00:53:45,907 --> 00:53:47,525
long does this last?

1034
00:53:47,933 --> 00:53:49,776
Oh. When you stop
seeing unicorns.

1035
00:53:51,800 --> 00:53:54,784
This is a Dundadully Dundoo trip Colt.

1036
00:53:55,700 --> 00:53:57,127
I'd like to speak to Kevin.

1037
00:53:57,647 --> 00:53:59,781
Kevin's, uh, on a break.

1038
00:54:00,026 --> 00:54:02,159
Okay, maybe you can help me.
Can I order the "fruit plate"?

1039
00:54:03,533 --> 00:54:06,100
Okay. Do you want me to call...

1040
00:54:06,614 --> 00:54:07,467
"room service"?

1041
00:54:07,625 --> 00:54:09,259
I don't know.
Is that what happens?

1042
00:54:09,533 --> 00:54:11,895
- D-Do you have a room? Should I just...
- Do I need one?

1043
00:54:12,042 --> 00:54:12,835
To order the fr...

1044
00:54:14,133 --> 00:54:15,089
- The fruit plate.
- Hey, Colt.

1045
00:54:15,116 --> 00:54:15,803
The fruit plate.

1046
00:54:18,333 --> 00:54:19,283
- Hi. Hey.
- That's a look.

1047
00:54:19,323 --> 00:54:20,342
What happened to your face?

1048
00:54:20,367 --> 00:54:21,309
- Hi.
- Hi.

1049
00:54:21,533 --> 00:54:22,400
Okay.

1050
00:54:22,973 --> 00:54:24,672
Are you good?
What's wrong with you?

1051
00:54:24,697 --> 00:54:26,386
- It's good to see you.
- Wow, you look terrible.

1052
00:54:26,411 --> 00:54:27,505
You look amazing.

1053
00:54:27,699 --> 00:54:29,875
Did you fall?
What happened to you?

1054
00:54:29,900 --> 00:54:31,018
Wow. You're so pretty.

1055
00:54:31,318 --> 00:54:32,672
Okay. Your face is bleeding.

1056
00:54:32,800 --> 00:54:33,862
- What?
- What happened to you?

1057
00:54:33,887 --> 00:54:36,420
Oh. No, I was running.
Just-- I was running.

1058
00:54:36,466 --> 00:54:38,763
Very unusual athleisure wear
for a run.

1059
00:54:39,303 --> 00:54:40,136
- This?
- Yeah.

1060
00:54:40,223 --> 00:54:41,813
Yeah, they gave me
the wrong bags at the airport,

1061
00:54:42,086 --> 00:54:43,920
but, you know, it's-- it works.

1062
00:54:44,167 --> 00:54:45,239
I can sweat.

1063
00:54:45,626 --> 00:54:47,206
If I'm gonna play Ryder,
I thought I should just,

1064
00:54:47,239 --> 00:54:48,173
like, cut weight a little,
you know...

1065
00:54:48,245 --> 00:54:49,613
You seem kind of tweaky.

1066
00:54:49,894 --> 00:54:51,942
I'm a little... spotty.

1067
00:54:52,100 --> 00:54:55,018
Like, when I--
my glucose levels get low.

1068
00:54:55,112 --> 00:54:55,878
I get a little...

1069
00:54:56,572 --> 00:54:58,019
Okay, is that a new thing?

1070
00:54:59,600 --> 00:55:00,579
Is that a new thing?

1071
00:55:00,604 --> 00:55:01,989
- What's that?
- Is that a new thing?

1072
00:55:02,014 --> 00:55:03,956
- Is your hair new?
- Yes, I cut it.

1073
00:55:03,990 --> 00:55:04,990
I changed my hair.

1074
00:55:05,248 --> 00:55:06,875
You changed your number.
We're even.

1075
00:55:06,902 --> 00:55:08,441
I thought we'd sort of
even the score.

1076
00:55:09,133 --> 00:55:11,214
Yeah. I have a lot of new s--

1077
00:55:11,262 --> 00:55:12,613
You know, I've learned
a lot about myself

1078
00:55:12,638 --> 00:55:14,666
since-since we last
seen each other.

1079
00:55:14,666 --> 00:55:16,870
A lot of doctors.
A lot of therapy.

1080
00:55:17,864 --> 00:55:18,830
A lot of work.

1081
00:55:19,166 --> 00:55:21,295
And I realized that, I'm a mess.

1082
00:55:21,340 --> 00:55:22,597
And you dodged a bullet.

1083
00:55:22,710 --> 00:55:24,538
You have some vault, aren't you?

1084
00:55:24,562 --> 00:55:27,050
Spill the beans.
Heavy how,

1085
00:55:27,819 --> 00:55:29,312
and wanted to be there for you.

1086
00:55:29,343 --> 00:55:32,343
Yeah you say that because
you're such a wonderful person

1087
00:55:32,600 --> 00:55:33,933
that you would say that but trust me

1088
00:55:33,933 --> 00:55:35,694
it’s that heavy and we were...

1089
00:55:35,925 --> 00:55:37,359
you know, we were so new so I just...

1090
00:55:37,700 --> 00:55:38,766
I figured that...

1091
00:55:39,820 --> 00:55:41,662
you know, spare you for all the stuff.

1092
00:55:44,900 --> 00:55:45,966
A lot of things you can't do.

1093
00:55:45,966 --> 00:55:47,064
- It's a lot of stuff.
- Like what?

1094
00:55:49,399 --> 00:55:52,028
We could-- it could have gone
in the bathroom stuff.

1095
00:55:52,666 --> 00:55:54,466
- For instance.
- I mean...

1096
00:55:55,866 --> 00:55:58,466
I would have been really good
at bathroom stuff.

1097
00:55:59,392 --> 00:56:00,006
What?

1098
00:56:00,085 --> 00:56:02,800
Yeah, I think I would have been
really helpful and gentle with you

1099
00:56:02,800 --> 00:56:03,987
and sweet and discreet,

1100
00:56:04,800 --> 00:56:06,300
I would have closed my eyes.

1101
00:56:07,652 --> 00:56:08,752
Held my breath.

1102
00:56:09,699 --> 00:56:11,066
Give you a sponge bath.

1103
00:56:11,392 --> 00:56:14,126
- Excuse me?
- I give a great sponge bath.

1104
00:56:14,326 --> 00:56:16,359
- Very thorough.
- What?

1105
00:56:19,800 --> 00:56:21,233
Okay.
Okay.

1106
00:56:21,500 --> 00:56:24,387
So thrilled about your new
relationship with fruit.

1107
00:56:24,532 --> 00:56:25,824
And I hope you'll be very happy.

1108
00:56:25,900 --> 00:56:26,740
It's just a fling.

1109
00:56:26,960 --> 00:56:27,746
It's not serious.

1110
00:56:27,866 --> 00:56:29,153
Trust me. I'm still...

1111
00:56:30,110 --> 00:56:31,159
hung up on my ex.

1112
00:56:31,340 --> 00:56:33,099
Yeah, but how she's supposed
to do quality work

1113
00:56:33,166 --> 00:56:34,966
if you keep harassing
her all the time.

1114
00:56:37,186 --> 00:56:37,813
Okay.

1115
00:56:38,047 --> 00:56:40,160
Can you go and grab your things?
We have ready...

1116
00:56:40,207 --> 00:56:40,614
Okay.

1117
00:56:40,639 --> 00:56:41,673
- Got a zip.
- Yup.

1118
00:56:41,799 --> 00:56:43,023
- What's going on?
- Seriously.

1119
00:56:43,264 --> 00:56:44,544
Colt, you're...

1120
00:56:45,532 --> 00:56:46,399
You look like
you've been busy.

1121
00:56:46,533 --> 00:56:47,793
Yeah. real busy, Gail.

1122
00:56:47,880 --> 00:56:48,680
Yeah. Good.

1123
00:56:49,666 --> 00:56:50,575
A lot of running around.

1124
00:56:50,600 --> 00:56:52,200
We'll get a drink and discuss that

1125
00:56:52,225 --> 00:56:53,361
but right now the studio...

1126
00:56:53,755 --> 00:56:55,025
so far up my ass

1127
00:56:55,050 --> 00:56:56,778
I can taste them.
We need your third act.

1128
00:56:56,805 --> 00:56:57,432
Okay. Yep.

1129
00:56:57,758 --> 00:56:59,222
You having problems
with the third act?

1130
00:56:59,500 --> 00:57:01,366
We're gonna, we're gonna go
and do things right now.

1131
00:57:01,366 --> 00:57:02,600
I need to write it.
I'm gonna go write it. I just--

1132
00:57:02,600 --> 00:57:05,333
It's like the studio are wanting me
to contort the love story

1133
00:57:05,333 --> 00:57:06,766
so that it all ends happily

1134
00:57:06,766 --> 00:57:07,899
and everything's rosy and...

1135
00:57:07,965 --> 00:57:09,410
- Jody, Jody, Jody.
- But I feel like if I...

1136
00:57:09,477 --> 00:57:10,577
lean into reality,

1137
00:57:10,866 --> 00:57:11,444
then...

1138
00:57:12,077 --> 00:57:13,175
maybe that's the way to go.

1139
00:57:13,200 --> 00:57:14,630
And most love stories
don't end well.

1140
00:57:14,891 --> 00:57:15,418
Usually.

1141
00:57:16,826 --> 00:57:19,560
- Know what I mean?
- I strongly disagree with that,

1142
00:57:19,600 --> 00:57:20,673
so, we should keep

1143
00:57:21,453 --> 00:57:22,208
chopping it up.

1144
00:57:22,262 --> 00:57:23,402
Yeah? Should we?

1145
00:57:23,494 --> 00:57:24,406
It's important.

1146
00:57:24,500 --> 00:57:25,325
It's the ending.

1147
00:57:25,818 --> 00:57:26,418
Okay.

1148
00:57:29,020 --> 00:57:29,633
Sir?

1149
00:57:30,589 --> 00:57:31,156
Huh?

1150
00:57:31,529 --> 00:57:32,003
Hi.

1151
00:57:32,210 --> 00:57:33,216
- Yeah.
- Hi.

1152
00:57:33,296 --> 00:57:36,355
Um, I hear that you're interested
in a-a fruit platter.

1153
00:57:37,386 --> 00:57:38,766
-  Kevin?
-  Yes.

1154
00:57:39,243 --> 00:57:40,723
Yes. Okay, so...

1155
00:57:40,943 --> 00:57:42,143
It's-it's on...

1156
00:57:42,609 --> 00:57:43,523
it's on ice.

1157
00:58:04,166 --> 00:58:06,500
Yep. There we go. Sorry.

1158
00:58:52,700 --> 00:58:53,008
Hello?

1159
00:58:53,032 --> 00:58:54,426
<i>What do you think
about split screen?</i>

1160
00:58:55,059 --> 00:58:55,926
Jody?

1161
00:58:56,092 --> 00:58:56,668
<i>Yeah.</i>

1162
00:58:57,160 --> 00:58:59,354
<i>Is this okay I'm calling?
You said to call and...</i>

1163
00:59:00,225 --> 00:59:01,380
- Yeah, it's fine.
<i>- Yeah?</i>

1164
00:59:01,466 --> 00:59:02,399
<i>We could chop it up?</i>

1165
00:59:03,376 --> 00:59:04,198
Let's chop it up.

1166
00:59:04,222 --> 00:59:05,250
<i>It's good time.
Not doing anything.</i>

1167
00:59:05,275 --> 00:59:06,136
Okay. Great.

1168
00:59:06,161 --> 00:59:07,961
<i>Uh, so,</i> split screen.

1169
00:59:08,241 --> 00:59:10,333
Right. Do you think that
it's like, nostalgic

1170
00:59:10,333 --> 00:59:12,820
super cool or do you think it's a gimmick?

1171
00:59:14,548 --> 00:59:16,146
I think
it could be super cool.

1172
00:59:16,812 --> 00:59:18,600
Yeah, how do you,
uh, want to use it?

1173
00:59:18,625 --> 00:59:20,000
I mean...
you know, tell me.

1174
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:21,013
Tell me everything.

1175
00:59:21,171 --> 00:59:22,863
Tell me, you know,
about your vision.

1176
00:59:23,333 --> 00:59:25,263
So, I like that
they're on-screen together.

1177
00:59:25,486 --> 00:59:26,974
But they are in
separate worlds...

1178
00:59:27,200 --> 00:59:28,989
...you know,
visually and emotionally.

1179
00:59:29,333 --> 00:59:31,452
So you've got
this very prominent divide

1180
00:59:31,606 --> 00:59:32,720
between the lovers.

1181
00:59:32,938 --> 00:59:33,906
And I want that.

1182
00:59:37,453 --> 00:59:39,886
- You want the divide?
- I want the divide, yes.

1183
00:59:44,426 --> 00:59:46,213
It's funny 'cause I-I didn't
get the impression

1184
00:59:46,246 --> 00:59:47,928
that there was that much
keeping them apart.

1185
00:59:48,001 --> 00:59:49,178
Well, you haven't
read the script.

1186
00:59:51,494 --> 00:59:53,984
All I know so far is that
the alien lady and the cowboy

1187
00:59:54,009 --> 00:59:57,588
are having what seem to be
pretty manageable problems.

1188
00:59:58,363 --> 01:00:00,410
Jody? Jod-- How's this?

1189
01:00:00,979 --> 01:00:02,246
Manageable problems?

1190
01:00:02,385 --> 01:00:04,685
The aliens invaded Earth,
and they left it in tatters.

1191
01:00:04,766 --> 01:00:07,593
So this whole thing the studio are pushing
for the "love conquers all" thing...

1192
01:00:08,700 --> 01:00:10,033
I'm not buying it.

1193
01:00:10,765 --> 01:00:13,698
Well, I have to admit that I'm
surprised to hear you say that.

1194
01:00:13,773 --> 01:00:14,573
Why?

1195
01:00:15,600 --> 01:00:17,966
Well, I'm just
a boy in a neon suit

1196
01:00:18,012 --> 01:00:19,146
standing in front of a girl,

1197
01:00:19,171 --> 01:00:22,067
reminding her that <i>Notting Hill</i>
is her favourite movie

1198
01:00:22,366 --> 01:00:25,531
and she watches <i>Love Actually</i>
every year at Christmas.

1199
01:00:25,800 --> 01:00:27,200
Well, you know
I watched it again this year

1200
01:00:27,200 --> 01:00:28,516
and I didn't love it, actually.

1201
01:00:30,133 --> 01:00:31,819
- Wow. It's worse than I thought.
- Yeah. I'm ruined.

1202
01:00:31,900 --> 01:00:33,892
Yeah. It's a really sad day for
<i>Notting Hill</i> as well.

1203
01:00:33,953 --> 01:00:35,237
The happily ever after stuff.

1204
01:00:35,466 --> 01:00:37,690
- Unsubscribe me.
- I didn't get happily ever after

1205
01:00:37,715 --> 01:00:38,933
- from <i>Notting Hill.</i>
- What are you talking about?

1206
01:00:38,933 --> 01:00:39,710
- Of course you did.
- Did you?

1207
01:00:39,735 --> 01:00:41,800
Yes, of course.
they're like they're on the park bench.

1208
01:00:41,800 --> 01:00:43,100
She's got a head in his knee.

1209
01:00:43,100 --> 01:00:44,075
- She's a "regular girl."

1210
01:00:44,100 --> 01:00:45,700
Maybe, but we don't know
for sure

1211
01:00:45,700 --> 01:00:47,536
she's not gonna go back
to working the street.

1212
01:00:48,292 --> 01:00:49,759
All we know is that
in the beginning,

1213
01:00:49,800 --> 01:00:51,666
she's pretty much up for
anything but kissing,

1214
01:00:51,666 --> 01:00:53,592
and in the end,
she's open to kissing him.

1215
01:00:54,099 --> 01:00:55,066
And it gives us hope.

1216
01:00:55,273 --> 01:00:57,100
- You have got your Julia Roberts movies
- And that's all we want.

1217
01:00:57,166 --> 01:00:58,086
- so twisted...
- A little hope.

1218
01:00:58,111 --> 01:00:59,211
No, that is <i>Pretty Woman</i>.

1219
01:00:59,300 --> 01:01:00,539
where she is
a lady of the night,

1220
01:01:00,564 --> 01:01:02,770
and this is <i>Notting Hill,</i>
where she's a very famous actress.

1221
01:01:03,170 --> 01:01:04,593
Well, don't listen to me.
What do I know?

1222
01:01:04,666 --> 01:01:05,953
Look, you're the director.

1223
01:01:06,580 --> 01:01:07,810
You're gonna make
the right choice.

1224
01:01:07,900 --> 01:01:09,370
I'm just saying,
for people like me,

1225
01:01:09,506 --> 01:01:11,971
who may not necessarily get the
metaphor...

1226
01:01:11,996 --> 01:01:13,571
- of the split screen.
- You may not get the deeper metaphor,

1227
01:01:13,596 --> 01:01:14,596
but you're gonna see it.

1228
01:01:14,666 --> 01:01:16,866
You're gonna see
this bright line between them

1229
01:01:16,900 --> 01:01:18,606
that we're gonna ache
to see blur.

1230
01:01:19,599 --> 01:01:21,257
You know, but maybe it can't.

1231
01:01:22,826 --> 01:01:23,700
Maybe it doesn't.

1232
01:01:23,725 --> 01:01:25,825
Right. Right. Yeah.

1233
01:01:28,179 --> 01:01:30,021
But what do we know, right?

1234
01:01:30,400 --> 01:01:31,900
'Cause all we know at this point

1235
01:01:31,900 --> 01:01:33,500
is that the cowboy
likes the alien.

1236
01:01:34,666 --> 01:01:36,066
Does the alien like the cowboy?

1237
01:01:36,066 --> 01:01:37,166
She's on the fence.

1238
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:38,800
Right

1239
01:01:39,366 --> 01:01:40,833
Because they got problems.

1240
01:01:41,300 --> 01:01:45,366
Because she's an alien and he's
a cowboy, and that's a problem.

1241
01:01:45,800 --> 01:01:47,566
But is it a problem
they can't overcome?

1242
01:01:47,566 --> 01:01:48,584
Here's a question.

1243
01:01:49,097 --> 01:01:50,500
Are they even gonna try?

1244
01:01:51,900 --> 01:01:52,966
What do you think?

1245
01:01:54,700 --> 01:01:56,366
Do you think they're gonna try?

1246
01:01:58,166 --> 01:01:59,233
I think...

1247
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:03,666
I think this was
a great brainstorm.

1248
01:02:07,533 --> 01:02:08,333
So...

1249
01:02:09,900 --> 01:02:11,666
what'd you decide
about the split screen?

1250
01:02:12,466 --> 01:02:13,766
I have a better idea.

1251
01:02:15,733 --> 01:02:17,033
I don't think you need it.

1252
01:02:17,366 --> 01:02:20,300
I think the connection between
these characters is so strong

1253
01:02:20,300 --> 01:02:21,966
that nothing can
come between them.

1254
01:02:23,600 --> 01:02:24,400
Jod?

1255
01:02:26,566 --> 01:02:27,366
Jody?

1256
01:02:51,506 --> 01:02:53,006
- <i>Hello?</i>
- Dead guy on ice.

1257
01:02:53,733 --> 01:02:54,533
<i>What?</i>

1258
01:02:55,266 --> 01:02:58,466
There's a dead guy on ice
at the hotel, Gail.

1259
01:02:59,105 --> 01:03:00,672
<i>Wait. Sorry.
What are you talking about?</i>

1260
01:03:00,740 --> 01:03:02,073
Well, if you think
that doesn't make sense,

1261
01:03:02,133 --> 01:03:03,039
don't order the fruit plate.

1262
01:03:03,112 --> 01:03:06,033
<i>Hold on, You're seriously telling me
you've just seen a dead body?</i>

1263
01:03:06,585 --> 01:03:07,485
Yes, Gail.

1264
01:03:07,566 --> 01:03:09,866
On the rocks. In the hotel.

1265
01:03:10,266 --> 01:03:11,374
What hotel?

1266
01:03:11,399 --> 01:03:13,434
The one I just saw you in, Gail!

1267
01:03:13,719 --> 01:03:14,985
So, whose room is it in?

1268
01:03:16,206 --> 01:03:17,773
It wasn't Kevin Kevin per se,

1269
01:03:17,993 --> 01:03:19,572
but he definitely had
something to do with it.

1270
01:03:19,686 --> 01:03:21,852
Who is Kevin?
It was in Kevin's room?

1271
01:03:21,979 --> 01:03:23,919
Gail, you asked me
to do this.

1272
01:03:23,965 --> 01:03:25,879
So, please try and keep up.

1273
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:27,074
I know. I'm sticking.

1274
01:03:27,527 --> 01:03:29,615
I went to Ryder's apartment
just like you told me.

1275
01:03:30,002 --> 01:03:32,279
That's where Iggy with the sword
and the silver cockatoo

1276
01:03:32,304 --> 01:03:34,092
put me in the neon suit
and they sent me

1277
01:03:34,117 --> 01:03:35,379
the man with the leopard print head.

1278
01:03:35,780 --> 01:03:36,422
Now...

1279
01:03:36,933 --> 01:03:38,546
He goes by the name of Doone.

1280
01:03:39,008 --> 01:03:42,081
It was Doone's goons who dirtied my Shirley,
and gave me the Dundee

1281
01:03:43,539 --> 01:03:45,073
and not in a fun way, Gail.

1282
01:03:45,200 --> 01:03:47,311
I think they were
trying to kill me, Gail!

1283
01:03:47,659 --> 01:03:49,786
So you can understand why
I chased him with my scooter

1284
01:03:49,811 --> 01:03:51,879
but when the unicorn
showed up I had no choice.

1285
01:03:51,965 --> 01:03:53,479
I had to hit their car with my body.

1286
01:03:53,586 --> 01:03:56,319
The point is that's how
I got the Kevin's fruit plate

1287
01:03:56,566 --> 01:03:57,899
and the dead guy on ice.

1288
01:03:58,538 --> 01:04:01,020
Do you understand now?
Does it make sense?

1289
01:04:01,125 --> 01:04:03,318
It's absolutely clear as mud.
Listen...

1290
01:04:03,606 --> 01:04:06,806
Don't-- just step away.
Step away and calm down.

1291
01:04:07,372 --> 01:04:08,606
I am gonna handle everything.

1292
01:04:08,700 --> 01:04:09,925
No more handling!

1293
01:04:10,166 --> 01:04:11,985
- I want the police!
- You're very aggressive.

1294
01:04:12,141 --> 01:04:13,775
I'm sorry. I'm sorry to yell.

1295
01:04:13,800 --> 01:04:15,800
- I want the police.
- You're not gonna talk to the police.

1296
01:04:15,800 --> 01:04:17,300
<i>You don't talk to anyone
about this, okay?</i>

1297
01:04:17,792 --> 01:04:19,785
- I'm calling the police.
- <i>You are not talking to the police.</i>

1298
01:04:20,492 --> 01:04:22,632
- Excuse me, sir.
- Wait, who's there?

1299
01:04:22,824 --> 01:04:23,919
It's the police.
I'm gonna talk to them.

1300
01:04:23,944 --> 01:04:25,444
<i>No, no, no, no, no!
Don't talk...</i>

1301
01:04:28,446 --> 01:04:30,512
No parking at any time.

1302
01:04:34,933 --> 01:04:35,733
Sorry.

1303
01:04:36,466 --> 01:04:37,914
Just making sure
we're both here.

1304
01:04:39,121 --> 01:04:40,395
I'm-I'm here, mate.

1305
01:04:40,533 --> 01:04:41,815
I want to report a crime.

1306
01:04:42,129 --> 01:04:43,582
- Okay.
- An ice crime.

1307
01:04:49,793 --> 01:04:52,550
Yeah. You're still
getting a ticket, mate.

1308
01:04:57,800 --> 01:04:58,930
I got to tell Jody. about the dead guy

1309
01:04:59,124 --> 01:05:00,157
About the dead guy.

1310
01:05:00,279 --> 01:05:01,445
How do you know he was dead?

1311
01:05:01,600 --> 01:05:03,007
He could've just been
knocked out.

1312
01:05:03,087 --> 01:05:04,367
- On ice?
- Yeah.

1313
01:05:04,392 --> 01:05:07,172
Ice baths are very good
for inflammation.

1314
01:05:07,720 --> 01:05:09,553
And are you forgetting
that you were high?

1315
01:05:09,979 --> 01:05:11,527
How can I if you keep fixating

1316
01:05:11,552 --> 01:05:12,927
- on that one point?
- Okay, you know what,

1317
01:05:12,952 --> 01:05:14,478
let me just stop you
right there.

1318
01:05:14,600 --> 01:05:16,300
- I don't know what I said.
- has got her all fired up.

1319
01:05:16,300 --> 01:05:17,891
I don't know I got her all
fired up about one

1320
01:05:17,916 --> 01:05:18,651
About what?

1321
01:05:18,806 --> 01:05:22,030
And now I have to build a truck
for a 250-foot jump.

1322
01:05:22,505 --> 01:05:24,705
- In a day and a half!
- Sounds pretty cool, actually.

1323
01:05:24,766 --> 01:05:26,962
And on top of that,
the fight scene today,

1324
01:05:27,219 --> 01:05:29,703
And Jody has decided that she wants
to do it all in one take.

1325
01:05:29,728 --> 01:05:30,281
A oner.

1326
01:05:30,407 --> 01:05:31,867
Dan, did you tell
him about the oner?

1327
01:05:31,987 --> 01:05:33,348
- Yes.
- So cool.

1328
01:05:33,433 --> 01:05:34,374
- Right?
- Yeah.

1329
01:05:34,441 --> 01:05:35,495
- So good. He's into it.
- Hi.

1330
01:05:36,166 --> 01:05:37,480
- Yeah, can I talk to you for a second?
- Okay,

1331
01:05:37,526 --> 01:05:39,033
about this sequence today,

1332
01:05:39,446 --> 01:05:41,425
Ryder's a no-show. Again, he's probably
on a bender or something.

1333
01:05:41,450 --> 01:05:43,039
Well, it's interesting you say that,
because that's...

1334
01:05:44,366 --> 01:05:45,459
...that's what I want to
talk to you about.

1335
01:05:45,484 --> 01:05:46,804
Me, too. Me, too.
Because we don't even

1336
01:05:46,998 --> 01:05:47,985
we don't even need him.

1337
01:05:48,100 --> 01:05:50,066
We don't need him.
I had an epiphany last night.

1338
01:05:50,066 --> 01:05:51,600
- Let me just tell you.
- Last night?

1339
01:05:51,692 --> 01:05:52,735
I was so excited.

1340
01:05:53,116 --> 01:05:54,969
After we spoke,
it all came to me.

1341
01:05:55,169 --> 01:05:55,889
- Really?
- Yeah.

1342
01:05:55,914 --> 01:05:57,988
The third act, this sequence,
all of it. I've been s...

1343
01:05:58,141 --> 01:05:59,054
After talking to me?

1344
01:05:59,079 --> 01:06:01,145
Yeah. You know, I was shocked
when you showed up.

1345
01:06:01,244 --> 01:06:01,964
- Right?
- Yeah.

1346
01:06:01,989 --> 01:06:02,850
- Well, it was...
- But...

1347
01:06:03,521 --> 01:06:04,095
shocking.

1348
01:06:04,120 --> 01:06:05,434
But I just started to wonder

1349
01:06:05,566 --> 01:06:08,154
if maybe you showed up
just at the right time, and...

1350
01:06:08,569 --> 01:06:10,566
I've been going for this thing
in the action,

1351
01:06:10,566 --> 01:06:11,900
and I've never been able
to get it.

1352
01:06:11,900 --> 01:06:14,463
Like this, feeling
of the pursuit of love.

1353
01:06:14,746 --> 01:06:17,080
And how far would you go for
the one that you love and...

1354
01:06:18,586 --> 01:06:19,919
You know?
And then...

1355
01:06:20,300 --> 01:06:23,320
You know, I realize it's not
very far with Ryder, 'cause he's a drip.

1356
01:06:23,375 --> 01:06:25,191
- Right.
- And he runs weird.

1357
01:06:25,216 --> 01:06:26,616
- Right
- And he can't do action,

1358
01:06:26,733 --> 01:06:28,238
- Well, it's...
- you can.

1359
01:06:28,966 --> 01:06:31,500
You can.
I'm unlimited with you.

1360
01:06:31,525 --> 01:06:33,306
I can do everything
and everything with you,

1361
01:06:33,338 --> 01:06:34,938
and it just made my brain just...

1362
01:06:36,300 --> 01:06:38,128
So cool. I don't need cuts,

1363
01:06:38,300 --> 01:06:39,933
I don't need gimmicks.
I don't need anything.

1364
01:06:39,933 --> 01:06:40,697
I just need you.

1365
01:06:41,791 --> 01:06:43,024
To finish this movie.

1366
01:06:43,049 --> 01:06:44,816
You know, maybe even make it
a great movie.

1367
01:06:44,900 --> 01:06:45,733
You know?

1368
01:06:46,439 --> 01:06:48,506
- Wow. Okay.
- What do you think?

1369
01:06:48,866 --> 01:06:50,076
Do you want to work together?

1370
01:06:50,466 --> 01:06:52,766
Shoot the shit out of Sydney
Opera House in four hours?

1371
01:06:52,766 --> 01:06:55,200
- Three hours and 52 minutes.
- Three hours and 52 minutes?

1372
01:06:56,333 --> 01:06:57,900
What are we waiting for?

1373
01:06:58,533 --> 01:06:59,667
Good! Okay!

1374
01:06:59,692 --> 01:07:00,786
Venti, Venti, come on.

1375
01:07:01,212 --> 01:07:02,969
I'm gonna get some dots
on your face, 'cause I need you

1376
01:07:02,994 --> 01:07:04,007
- but not your face.
- oh God.

1377
01:07:04,032 --> 01:07:04,978
Get-- Yeah, just get rid of it.

1378
01:07:05,003 --> 01:07:06,271
I'm gonna stick right his head on okay

1379
01:07:06,296 --> 01:07:07,893
- Okay. Cool. Okay, okay.
- Yeah. Okay. Yeah.

1380
01:07:08,826 --> 01:07:09,918
<i>Ready for a take?</i>

1381
01:07:10,079 --> 01:07:11,290
Make it rain, please!

1382
01:08:59,192 --> 01:09:00,692
- Oh.
- Thank you.

1383
01:09:01,428 --> 01:09:02,395
How'd we do, boss?

1384
01:09:02,629 --> 01:09:04,695
Yeah, it was good.
I mean, it was amazing.

1385
01:09:04,695 --> 01:09:06,645
It was so amazing,
we're gonna go do some karaoke,

1386
01:09:06,670 --> 01:09:07,269
- if you...
- Oh.

1387
01:09:07,725 --> 01:09:08,816
If you like karaoke,

1388
01:09:09,109 --> 01:09:10,622
you know, you could--
you could come.

1389
01:09:10,942 --> 01:09:12,307
Like, I'd--
I would like you to.

1390
01:09:13,603 --> 01:09:14,584
I'll be there.

1391
01:09:14,817 --> 01:09:15,550
Okay.

1392
01:09:17,100 --> 01:09:18,006
I don't know what that was.

1393
01:09:18,115 --> 01:09:19,786
That was just so awful and...

1394
01:09:19,839 --> 01:09:21,199
- Really?
- Yeah, who's she?

1395
01:09:21,776 --> 01:09:22,858
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1396
01:09:23,211 --> 01:09:24,220
- Holster that.
- It's holstered.

1397
01:09:24,220 --> 01:09:26,090
It's done. Forget.
You-you never saw it.

1398
01:09:30,143 --> 01:09:32,020
Jody, do you like
Christina or Britney?

1399
01:09:34,790 --> 01:09:35,764
I saw that.

1400
01:09:36,632 --> 01:09:39,045
- You saw the finger guns?
- Oh, I saw the finger guns.

1401
01:09:40,766 --> 01:09:41,559
She started it.

1402
01:09:42,092 --> 01:09:42,879
Hi.

1403
01:09:44,125 --> 01:09:45,720
I didn't ha--
I didn't have breakfast.

1404
01:09:45,954 --> 01:09:46,966
Yeah, you did.

1405
01:09:47,540 --> 01:09:49,401
- I disagree.
-I gave you a brekky wrap this morning.

1406
01:09:49,426 --> 01:09:50,883
Technically,
this is all meal penalty,

1407
01:09:50,943 --> 01:09:52,202
- if you want the...
- It's fine. Just-just sign.

1408
01:09:52,738 --> 01:09:53,764
- Thanks.
- I'm just saying,

1409
01:09:53,789 --> 01:09:55,421
not everyone's gonna be
as cool about it as I am.

1410
01:09:55,446 --> 01:09:56,560
- You know?
- No, I get it.

1411
01:09:57,339 --> 01:09:58,154
What is this?

1412
01:09:58,179 --> 01:10:01,278
I've got you on a 5:55 flight
out of here.

1413
01:10:01,573 --> 01:10:03,339
Okay? I have a car waiting for you.

1414
01:10:03,364 --> 01:10:04,193
- Now?
- Engine's on.

1415
01:10:04,293 --> 01:10:04,894
Yeah.

1416
01:10:05,091 --> 01:10:05,893
Colt...

1417
01:10:06,585 --> 01:10:08,990
there is some serious shit
going down, okay?

1418
01:10:10,028 --> 01:10:11,762
I just told Jody I was gonna
meet her for karaoke.

1419
01:10:11,762 --> 01:10:13,767
And I'm actually embarrassed
that I got you here

1420
01:10:13,854 --> 01:10:15,361
and got you all tangled up.

1421
01:10:15,891 --> 01:10:17,811
I just want to get you out
of here before it escalates.

1422
01:10:17,978 --> 01:10:19,077
Get your stuff together.
We're going.

1423
01:10:19,077 --> 01:10:20,359
You're gonna miss the flight.
Thank you.

1424
01:10:21,160 --> 01:10:22,348
- Sorry.
- Okay, but I'm late,

1425
01:10:22,373 --> 01:10:24,115
and I got to get Ryder's dogs
to daycare.

1426
01:10:24,437 --> 01:10:26,298
Fluffy needs her oatmeal bath.
She gets hives.

1427
01:10:26,478 --> 01:10:28,218
Hey, should I be
looking for another job, Alma?

1428
01:10:29,240 --> 01:10:30,527
You're Ryder's assistant.
You must know.

1429
01:10:30,627 --> 01:10:33,347
All I can tell you is that
if Ryder is a no-show tomorrow,

1430
01:10:33,825 --> 01:10:35,662
the studio will shut us down.

1431
01:10:36,080 --> 01:10:37,293
Ugh. Poor Jody.

1432
01:10:37,522 --> 01:10:39,262
Say hello to directors' jail.

1433
01:10:41,297 --> 01:10:44,673
Am I crazy or is Nigel hot?

1434
01:10:47,612 --> 01:10:49,982
He-- Wow, he's got
some great qualities.

1435
01:10:50,007 --> 01:10:51,970
He really does. Yeah, you
should go for it, Venti.

1436
01:10:51,995 --> 01:10:52,935
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1437
01:11:12,202 --> 01:11:13,216
Jean-Claude.

1438
01:11:13,243 --> 01:11:14,290
<i>Good day, sir</i>

1439
01:11:14,533 --> 01:11:15,787
<i>Good day.</i>

1440
01:11:15,940 --> 01:11:18,360
<i>How are you doing?</i>

1441
01:11:18,685 --> 01:11:20,892
<i>You're such a good boy.</i>

1442
01:11:21,174 --> 01:11:22,750
Sorry, his commands
are in French...

1443
01:11:22,775 --> 01:11:23,900
French. I know.

1444
01:11:24,048 --> 01:11:25,341
I worked with him on a movie,
you know.

1445
01:11:25,821 --> 01:11:26,716
Can't believe he kept him.

1446
01:11:26,804 --> 01:11:28,344
Well, it's more for
a party trick, really.

1447
01:11:28,531 --> 01:11:30,295
This one's got a command
where he'll bite people in the balls.

1448
01:11:30,320 --> 01:11:31,284
Yeah, yeah, yeah. We-we know.

1449
01:11:31,309 --> 01:11:32,404
- No, no, don't.
<i>- Attaque...</i>

1450
01:11:33,016 --> 01:11:35,050
- Alma, right? I'm Colt...
- Colt Seavers.

1451
01:11:35,811 --> 01:11:36,860
I know who you are.

1452
01:11:36,884 --> 01:11:37,451
You know...

1453
01:11:37,962 --> 01:11:39,242
Of course you know.
I'm not surprised

1454
01:11:39,324 --> 01:11:40,557
What is that supposed to mean?

1455
01:11:40,582 --> 01:11:42,699
'Cause you're an assistant.
You guys secretly rule the world.

1456
01:11:42,891 --> 01:11:44,491
- You're not wrong.
- Look,

1457
01:11:44,660 --> 01:11:45,546
I had a really rough,

1458
01:11:45,638 --> 01:11:46,453
24 hours.

1459
01:11:46,658 --> 01:11:47,586
Maybe 48.

1460
01:11:47,641 --> 01:11:49,088
I don't know.
It's yesterday in LA,

1461
01:11:49,221 --> 01:11:50,594
I've already had a terrible tomorrow.

1462
01:11:50,988 --> 01:11:52,474
so if you could just tell me
what you know.

1463
01:11:52,889 --> 01:11:54,156
That would be amazing.

1464
01:11:55,693 --> 01:11:57,806
You grew up in Florida
until your parents divorced.

1465
01:11:57,928 --> 01:11:59,148
You were raised by a single mother.

1466
01:11:59,173 --> 01:12:00,401
You were an overactive child.

1467
01:12:00,426 --> 01:12:01,898
So she put you into martial arts.

1468
01:12:02,118 --> 01:12:03,464
You got four belts in one year.

1469
01:12:03,668 --> 01:12:05,881
You got hired in the stunt industry
when a local stuntman saw you

1470
01:12:05,921 --> 01:12:07,028
jumping off a buddy's roof.

1471
01:12:07,089 --> 01:12:09,229
And you used to double for Ryder.
until you broke your back.

1472
01:12:09,449 --> 01:12:10,156
Rough.

1473
01:12:10,686 --> 01:12:12,966
6'1 185 and your favourite colour is blue

1474
01:12:13,934 --> 01:12:14,561
Okay.

1475
01:12:15,636 --> 01:12:16,209
Well...

1476
01:12:16,964 --> 01:12:17,657
after that...

1477
01:12:18,277 --> 01:12:19,651
...oddly specific and...

1478
01:12:20,903 --> 01:12:22,096
sad summary of my life,

1479
01:12:22,156 --> 01:12:23,969
can we move on to Ryder?

1480
01:12:24,364 --> 01:12:26,131
Help me walk these guys
to doggy daycare?

1481
01:12:27,321 --> 01:12:28,208
Can I walk him?

1482
01:12:40,519 --> 01:12:43,307
So, the last time I saw Tom,
everything was pretty normal.

1483
01:12:43,813 --> 01:12:45,871
<i>He and Henry were
in some kind of drug-induced,</i>

1484
01:12:45,904 --> 01:12:47,535
<i>shirtless shit-show
grappling match.</i>

1485
01:12:47,904 --> 01:12:48,712
That's pretty normal.

1486
01:12:48,815 --> 01:12:49,890
Yeah, typical.

1487
01:12:50,355 --> 01:12:52,763
But then Gail called me early
the next morning in a panic.

1488
01:12:55,196 --> 01:12:56,599
Drop whatever you're doing.

1489
01:12:56,786 --> 01:12:58,493
Tom has lost his phone again.

1490
01:12:58,585 --> 01:13:00,318
so I headed to the apartment
expecting the usual,

1491
01:13:00,352 --> 01:13:02,205
you know, naked debauchery

1492
01:13:02,333 --> 01:13:04,300
piles of drugs, people passed out.

1493
01:13:04,819 --> 01:13:06,180
But this time it was different.

1494
01:13:06,530 --> 01:13:07,931
There was nobody there.

1495
01:13:08,315 --> 01:13:09,749
It was spotless.

1496
01:13:10,150 --> 01:13:11,709
Bu I did found the phone,

1497
01:13:12,143 --> 01:13:13,236
the one that Dressler,

1498
01:13:13,409 --> 01:13:15,977
Ryder's creepy security goon,
just called me about.

1499
01:13:16,002 --> 01:13:17,995
<i>Metalstorm</i> crew,
we have a call time of

1500
01:13:18,057 --> 01:13:19,321
6:00 a.m. tomorrow. Don't
be late.

1501
01:13:21,573 --> 01:13:23,828
Hey. Two shots of tequila, please.

1502
01:13:23,916 --> 01:13:25,373
- Hey.
- Wow.

1503
01:13:25,932 --> 01:13:27,512
I didn't think you liked
coming to these things.

1504
01:13:27,678 --> 01:13:30,021
What are you talking about?
I love listening to people

1505
01:13:30,021 --> 01:13:31,802
murder my favourite songs.
Thank you.

1506
01:13:34,161 --> 01:13:35,356
I got to get to karaoke.

1507
01:13:37,424 --> 01:13:38,184
Thanks, Amy.

1508
01:13:38,491 --> 01:13:39,606
Au revoir, Jean-Claude.

1509
01:13:40,099 --> 01:13:41,107
You got to get rid
of that thing.

1510
01:13:41,132 --> 01:13:42,172
Why don't you just give it
to Gail?

1511
01:13:42,197 --> 01:13:44,472
Whatever's on this phone
is a goddamn bazooka

1512
01:13:44,497 --> 01:13:46,352
that'll blow
a movie star-sized hole

1513
01:13:46,377 --> 01:13:47,611
through somebody's career.

1514
01:13:47,973 --> 01:13:50,374
I'm happy to get this
into the hands of a good guy.

1515
01:13:50,470 --> 01:13:52,637
- Okay...
- For the right price.

1516
01:13:53,262 --> 01:13:54,291
What do you want for it?

1517
01:13:54,544 --> 01:13:55,570
A producer credit.

1518
01:13:55,634 --> 01:13:56,777
On <i>Metalstorm?</i>

1519
01:13:56,815 --> 01:13:58,162
Winner winner chiken dinner.

1520
01:13:58,268 --> 01:13:59,742
Are you out of you mind?

1521
01:13:59,860 --> 01:14:01,624
Look, I need
career protection, okay?

1522
01:14:01,649 --> 01:14:02,749
I'm burning myself with this.

1523
01:14:02,977 --> 01:14:05,310
I mean I want Megadeth
to come out with a new record

1524
01:14:05,335 --> 01:14:06,159
and we have to accept that

1525
01:14:06,184 --> 01:14:07,379
some things are not gonna happen.

1526
01:14:07,412 --> 01:14:09,696
it's not like I'm asking
for points on the back end here, okay?

1527
01:14:09,721 --> 01:14:11,904
I know there's a lot of
producers pissing in that pool.

1528
01:14:11,987 --> 01:14:12,997
I'm a stunt guy.

1529
01:14:13,022 --> 01:14:14,123
What am I supposed to do
about it?

1530
01:14:14,148 --> 01:14:16,016
You're a stunt guy
who used to date the director

1531
01:14:16,041 --> 01:14:18,297
and seems to be getting close
to rekindling

1532
01:14:18,322 --> 01:14:21,259
some sort of short but
legendary, torrid love affair.

1533
01:14:21,525 --> 01:14:23,105
Drop it into the pillow talk.
I don’t know.

1534
01:14:23,165 --> 01:14:24,633
Do you think
we're close to rekindling, though?

1535
01:14:24,767 --> 01:14:27,835
I mean, I feel like we are
it feels like it.

1536
01:14:27,860 --> 01:14:29,172
But I'm saying from your perspective,

1537
01:14:29,199 --> 01:14:29,765
Do you...

1538
01:14:30,432 --> 01:14:30,872
truly...

1539
01:14:31,052 --> 01:14:32,146
What do I know?

1540
01:14:32,390 --> 01:14:33,523
Well, you seems to know a lot.

1541
01:14:34,109 --> 01:14:35,632
- You did say...
- Is it a deal or not?

1542
01:14:37,141 --> 01:14:38,456
It can help you find Ryder.

1543
01:14:38,956 --> 01:14:40,062
I'll do what I can.

1544
01:14:40,249 --> 01:14:41,188
I don't have the passcode.

1545
01:14:41,479 --> 01:14:43,405
Just figure it out,
okay, stuntman?

1546
01:14:43,576 --> 01:14:44,430
Just find Ryder.

1547
01:14:44,590 --> 01:14:45,477
I'm gonna need you
to sign an NDA.

1548
01:14:46,149 --> 01:14:46,973
As you know,

1549
01:14:46,973 --> 01:14:48,645
- I don't have time for an NDA. I got to--
- nothing in this industry...

1550
01:14:48,645 --> 01:14:49,745
I'm late for karaoke.

1551
01:15:00,033 --> 01:15:01,727
Jean-Claude!

1552
01:15:04,593 --> 01:15:06,425
Ryder's phone. Where is it?

1553
01:15:13,872 --> 01:15:15,738
What am I doing?
What am I doing?

1554
01:15:17,841 --> 01:15:19,019
You sad that he left town?

1555
01:15:19,564 --> 01:15:20,265
Who?

1556
01:15:20,497 --> 01:15:20,969
Colt.

1557
01:15:21,209 --> 01:15:21,836
No, he didn't.

1558
01:15:22,022 --> 01:15:24,506
He's coming here. He's swinging
by to sing some karaoke.

1559
01:15:24,913 --> 01:15:25,688
No... I...

1560
01:15:26,038 --> 01:15:27,652
 I gave him the tickets.

1561
01:15:31,054 --> 01:15:32,469
I see it! I see it!

1562
01:15:36,295 --> 01:15:37,398
Engage your core.

1563
01:15:52,619 --> 01:15:54,852
I need him to finish the movie.

1564
01:15:54,877 --> 01:15:57,438
Why would-- why wouldn't you
talk to me about it?

1565
01:16:05,477 --> 01:16:06,350
What?

1566
01:16:07,038 --> 01:16:07,958
Oh, chicken?

1567
01:16:08,177 --> 01:16:08,997
Really?

1568
01:16:09,651 --> 01:16:10,958
Transfer will kill me.

1569
01:16:11,417 --> 01:16:12,064
Okay?

1570
01:16:12,361 --> 01:16:13,534
It's product placement!

1571
01:16:13,574 --> 01:16:14,980
Give me that.

1572
01:16:17,162 --> 01:16:17,661
Fine.

1573
01:16:18,204 --> 01:16:19,271
Call me chicken.

1574
01:16:20,414 --> 01:16:22,060
All right. Okay, tough guy.

1575
01:16:33,112 --> 01:16:34,294
Okay, Jean-Claude.

1576
01:16:35,161 --> 01:16:36,792
I'll buy you a drink
when this is over.

1577
01:16:37,129 --> 01:16:38,322
<i>Attaque!</i>

1578
01:16:40,368 --> 01:16:42,581
Get away! Help! Help!

1579
01:16:42,817 --> 01:16:45,325
You've been so distracted.
You should have spoken to me.

1580
01:16:45,749 --> 01:16:46,675
This crossed wires-- Excuse me.

1581
01:16:46,700 --> 01:16:47,822
Can I get another, please?
Thank you.

1582
01:16:51,726 --> 01:16:53,220
God!

1583
01:16:53,220 --> 01:16:55,563
-  Get me out!

1584
01:17:02,570 --> 01:17:06,066
Stay back! Stay back!
Stay back! Stay back!

1585
01:17:13,319 --> 01:17:15,038
I thought you wanted me
to get rid of him.

1586
01:17:16,589 --> 01:17:17,918
And he just left?

1587
01:17:22,066 --> 01:17:23,313
Still got it, man!

1588
01:17:24,278 --> 01:17:25,540
I'm working with you.

1589
01:17:28,575 --> 01:17:30,658
Who are you working for?!
Where's Ryder?!

1590
01:17:30,729 --> 01:17:32,027
- I don't know! I don't know!
- Tell me where he is!

1591
01:17:41,593 --> 01:17:42,920
Where's the phone, stuntman?

1592
01:17:42,945 --> 01:17:44,368
I need that video!

1593
01:17:44,400 --> 01:17:45,388
Wow, he didn't tell you.

1594
01:17:45,963 --> 01:17:47,360
Jean-Claude!

1595
01:17:52,409 --> 01:17:53,905
Can I get another one, please?

1596
01:17:57,323 --> 01:17:58,586
Thank you.

1597
01:17:58,769 --> 01:18:00,189
I really thought
I was doing my job.

1598
01:18:00,249 --> 01:18:01,140
It's fine.

1599
01:18:01,564 --> 01:18:02,413
But you know what?

1600
01:18:02,833 --> 01:18:03,941
He can do whatever he wants.

1601
01:18:03,966 --> 01:18:06,681
He's an adult human male,
and he should do as he pleases.

1602
01:18:06,706 --> 01:18:07,578
He should just...

1603
01:18:07,742 --> 01:18:09,531
...you know, go his own way,
you know?

1604
01:18:09,556 --> 01:18:11,260
But that means
y-you can focus up now.

1605
01:18:11,504 --> 01:18:12,470
- Yeah.
- You know, you have a massive--

1606
01:18:12,657 --> 01:18:14,669
Do you know you have a big, fat hit

1607
01:18:14,694 --> 01:18:15,863
- on your hands?
- I know. Yeah.

1608
01:18:16,472 --> 01:18:18,276
- It's <i>High Noon</i> at...
<i>- High Noon.</i>

1609
01:18:18,301 --> 01:18:19,831
- ...the edge of the universe.
- Edge of the universe.

1610
01:18:19,919 --> 01:18:21,497
Yes. Hear it yourself.

1611
01:18:22,335 --> 01:18:23,598
Forget about him. Just...

1612
01:18:23,704 --> 01:18:25,770
All right, uh, next up,
uh, we got a Jody.

1613
01:18:25,845 --> 01:18:27,915
- Is there a Jody in the house?
- Yes!

1614
01:18:27,972 --> 01:18:29,519
- Right here, right here!
- Ah. There she is.

1615
01:18:29,544 --> 01:18:31,577
Big round of applause for Jody!

1616
01:18:33,035 --> 01:18:34,642
I actually want
to change my song.

1617
01:18:37,807 --> 01:18:38,652
That one.

1618
01:19:26,455 --> 01:19:27,101
Jean-Claude.

1619
01:19:27,126 --> 01:19:28,080
<i>Go help!</i>

1620
01:19:49,893 --> 01:19:51,133
I love this song.

1621
01:20:46,287 --> 01:20:47,948
Come on, everyone. Let's do it.

1622
01:21:15,567 --> 01:21:16,566
- Brake!
- I can't!

1623
01:21:16,591 --> 01:21:17,722
There's something stuck!

1624
01:21:18,644 --> 01:21:19,454
Jean-Claude,
what are you doing?!

1625
01:21:19,479 --> 01:21:20,352
What are you just
sitting there for?!

1626
01:21:20,445 --> 01:21:21,505
Get the bootle.

1627
01:21:35,814 --> 01:21:36,939
You okay?

1628
01:21:40,637 --> 01:21:41,506
You?

1629
01:21:46,628 --> 01:21:47,968
I gotta get to karaoke.

1630
01:22:27,159 --> 01:22:28,011
Colt?

1631
01:22:30,514 --> 01:22:31,055
Where's Jody?

1632
01:22:31,726 --> 01:22:32,460
She left.

1633
01:22:33,160 --> 01:22:33,966
Where were you?

1634
01:22:34,319 --> 01:22:36,019
At a rave?
In a sewer?

1635
01:22:36,527 --> 01:22:37,456
What's with the dog?

1636
01:22:37,636 --> 01:22:38,676
It's a long story.

1637
01:22:41,499 --> 01:22:43,379
Give me a sunset on ice
and a water back.

1638
01:22:43,445 --> 01:22:44,245
Coming right up.

1639
01:22:48,971 --> 01:22:49,693
What's this?

1640
01:22:51,624 --> 01:22:52,478
It's Ryder's phone.

1641
01:22:52,569 --> 01:22:53,531
Why do you have Ryder's phone?

1642
01:22:53,899 --> 01:22:56,106
All I know is some really bad guys
are trying to get it.

1643
01:22:56,531 --> 01:22:57,660
Are you serious? What?

1644
01:22:58,099 --> 01:22:59,794
I just got to figure out
what's on there.

1645
01:23:01,174 --> 01:23:03,302
Then find Ryder and get him
to finish Jody's movie.

1646
01:23:03,377 --> 01:23:03,825
Okay.

1647
01:23:04,352 --> 01:23:04,992
Well, shit, yeah.

1648
01:23:05,019 --> 01:23:07,301
Venti, she's like a tech genius
at this stuff.

1649
01:23:07,613 --> 01:23:08,746
Thank you!

1650
01:23:08,771 --> 01:23:09,533
Hey, Venti!

1651
01:23:10,161 --> 01:23:11,943
- Ventilicious.
- Hey.

1652
01:23:12,405 --> 01:23:13,827
What's poppin' on, boys?

1653
01:23:14,477 --> 01:23:14,712
- Yeah, Ventinator.

1654
01:23:17,197 --> 01:23:18,403
You know how
to get into this thing?

1655
01:23:21,338 --> 01:23:23,102
Oh, I've seen
some of these guys.

1656
01:23:23,131 --> 01:23:24,783
This thing is a vault.

1657
01:23:25,093 --> 01:23:26,743
It'll take me like two or three days

1658
01:23:26,768 --> 01:23:27,938
- to crack this thing.
- Yeah, but you're like,

1659
01:23:27,963 --> 01:23:28,891
a tech genius you know?

1660
01:23:28,916 --> 01:23:29,951
What if you don't have
three days?

1661
01:23:30,017 --> 01:23:31,737
You need the password.
I'm telling you that.

1662
01:23:31,950 --> 01:23:33,050
You're next.

1663
01:23:33,573 --> 01:23:34,127
Nigel.

1664
01:23:34,572 --> 01:23:35,829
Nigel!

1665
01:23:37,923 --> 01:23:39,124
Knowing Ryder, it's...

1666
01:23:39,888 --> 01:23:41,999
written on a Post-it note
in his apartment somewhere.

1667
01:23:42,628 --> 01:23:43,050
Okay.

1668
01:23:44,891 --> 01:23:46,717
Okay, next up, we've got Dan.

1669
01:23:46,798 --> 01:23:48,565
Come on, buddy. Come on, Dan.

1670
01:23:48,590 --> 01:23:49,596
Don't be shy, mate.

1671
01:23:50,076 --> 01:23:51,156
Come on, buddy.

1672
01:23:51,389 --> 01:23:52,104
Let's go.

1673
01:23:52,129 --> 01:23:52,971
You owe me!

1674
01:23:54,122 --> 01:23:56,228
<i>Finish your drink.</i>

1675
01:23:59,471 --> 01:24:00,631
It's got to be around here
somewhere.

1676
01:24:01,384 --> 01:24:02,810
Let's just split up.
Jean-Claude...

1677
01:24:03,182 --> 01:24:04,761
<i>Guard the cockatoo.</i>

1678
01:24:35,627 --> 01:24:38,093
You know what? I deserve this.

1679
01:24:40,949 --> 01:24:41,850
Idiot.

1680
01:24:44,802 --> 01:24:45,449
Colt?

1681
01:24:46,257 --> 01:24:46,984
Colt!

1682
01:24:47,284 --> 01:24:48,728
I got it! Colt!

1683
01:24:49,261 --> 01:24:50,187
To finishing the movie.

1684
01:24:50,649 --> 01:24:51,754
I think I got it.

1685
01:24:53,930 --> 01:24:54,488
All right.

1686
01:24:54,810 --> 01:24:56,183
That guy mentioned a video.

1687
01:24:56,820 --> 01:24:59,163
<i>Oh, baby, I'm here at work,</i>

1688
01:24:59,254 --> 01:25:01,473
<i>but I got a little something
for you, a little surprise.</i>

1689
01:25:01,682 --> 01:25:03,002
<i>It's just above my ass.</i>

1690
01:25:03,732 --> 01:25:05,280
Oh, my God. Cover your eyes.

1691
01:25:05,334 --> 01:25:07,189
I think I've seen Tom's ass
more than my own.

1692
01:25:09,128 --> 01:25:11,683
Now is the winter
of our discontent

1693
01:25:11,770 --> 01:25:13,358
<i>Made glorious summer</i>

1694
01:25:13,571 --> 01:25:15,071
<i>- by this sun of York...</i>
- He's such a dick.

1695
01:25:16,055 --> 01:25:17,247
But, God, he's good.

1696
01:25:17,247 --> 01:25:17,955
Yeah.

1697
01:25:20,279 --> 01:25:21,236
What about this?

1698
01:25:24,886 --> 01:25:26,406
Look at him.
He's jacked to the tits.

1699
01:25:27,414 --> 01:25:29,080
So much for that silver cockatoo.

1700
01:25:31,350 --> 01:25:33,505
Oh, here's that party his
assistant was talking about.

1701
01:25:34,919 --> 01:25:35,891
Iggy.

1702
01:25:35,933 --> 01:25:36,807
Wait a second. Who's that?

1703
01:25:36,906 --> 01:25:38,764
That's Henry.
That's Ryder's stunt double.

1704
01:25:41,298 --> 01:25:43,364
He looks a lot like the guy
I saw at the hotel.

1705
01:25:45,134 --> 01:25:46,141
When you were high?

1706
01:25:46,888 --> 01:25:48,216
And you were seeing unicorns?

1707
01:25:48,633 --> 01:25:50,110
And a dead guy on ice.

1708
01:25:55,880 --> 01:25:57,858
<i>Hell yeah! Come on!</i>

1709
01:25:58,212 --> 01:25:59,582
<i>What?! What?!</i>

1710
01:26:00,181 --> 01:26:02,081
<i>Do I do my own stunts?</i>

1711
01:26:02,216 --> 01:26:03,547
<i>I think I do.</i>

1712
01:26:03,547 --> 01:26:05,249
<i>I think I freakin' do.</i>

1713
01:26:05,692 --> 01:26:06,809
<i>Yeah, baby.</i>

1714
01:26:16,265 --> 01:26:17,605
<i>Uh, gimme, gimme,
gimme, gimme...</i>

1715
01:26:17,605 --> 01:26:18,672
<i>Gimme the phone.
Gimme the phone.</i>

1716
01:26:22,102 --> 01:26:23,985
- Oh, shit.
- Did they just kill Henry?

1717
01:26:34,061 --> 01:26:35,381
They just killed Henry.

1718
01:26:37,088 --> 01:26:38,280
- Oh, it's Venti.

1719
01:26:39,123 --> 01:26:40,287
- Hey, uh...
- <i>Dan.</i>

1720
01:26:40,358 --> 01:26:42,055
- Hello?
- <i>Turn on the news right now.</i>

1721
01:26:43,651 --> 01:26:44,910
<i>I can't believe this!</i>

1722
01:26:46,062 --> 01:26:49,068
<i>The dead body discovered this
morning at the Pendleton Hotel</i>

1723
01:26:49,093 --> 01:26:51,420
<i>has been identified
as Henry Herrera,</i>

1724
01:26:51,595 --> 01:26:54,906
<i>an American stuntman known for
doubling superstar Tom Ryder.</i>

1725
01:26:55,219 --> 01:26:57,737
<i>Authorities are investigating
his death as a murder.</i>

1726
01:26:57,970 --> 01:27:00,059
<i>Their prime suspect
is another stuntman,</i>

1727
01:27:00,252 --> 01:27:02,936
<i>Colt Seavers, who was
last seen in the hotel room</i>

1728
01:27:03,056 --> 01:27:04,787
<i>where Herrera's body
was discovered.</i>

1729
01:27:05,587 --> 01:27:07,907
<i>Police have released
this security footage</i>

1730
01:27:07,932 --> 01:27:10,112
<i>showing Seavers leaving
the scene of the crime.</i>

1731
01:27:10,515 --> 01:27:13,079
<i>If you have any information,
please do us a favour,</i>

1732
01:27:13,104 --> 01:27:15,861
<i>reach out to Crime Stoppers
by the number on your screen.</i>

1733
01:27:15,861 --> 01:27:18,466
<i>And we'll have more on that
later. In the meantime...</i>

1734
01:27:22,692 --> 01:27:23,916
I got to call Jody.

1735
01:27:24,689 --> 01:27:25,916
<i>It's high noon</i>

1736
01:27:26,896 --> 01:27:28,603
<i>at the edge of
the universe, folks.</i>

1737
01:27:30,139 --> 01:27:31,077
Which one was that?

1738
01:27:31,217 --> 01:27:33,462
- That was take four.
- <i>Goddamn it, Jody.</i>

1739
01:27:33,487 --> 01:27:35,462
<i>I mean. It looks like
frickin' Burning Man.</i>

1740
01:27:35,953 --> 01:27:38,386
<i>My balls are drenched.
I need a towel.</i>

1741
01:27:41,515 --> 01:27:44,206
This dude always forgets
that he's mic'd.

1742
01:27:44,483 --> 01:27:46,551
- I know.
- He says the craziest shit.

1743
01:27:46,551 --> 01:27:48,387
Craziest shit. I know, I know.

1744
01:27:49,360 --> 01:27:50,740
What, is it on airplane mode?

1745
01:27:51,020 --> 01:27:52,740
If this was <i>The Fugitive</i>

1746
01:27:52,997 --> 01:27:55,243
and you were Harrison Ford...

1747
01:27:56,495 --> 01:27:58,527
the bad guys would be
closing in.

1748
01:28:01,187 --> 01:28:02,094
I call tomahawk.

1749
01:28:02,303 --> 01:28:03,749
- Damn it.
- You stay alive.

1750
01:28:04,289 --> 01:28:05,182
Stay alive.

1751
01:28:05,476 --> 01:28:06,997
No matter how long it takes.

1752
01:28:07,157 --> 01:28:09,849
No matter how far, I will

1753
01:28:09,981 --> 01:28:10,861
find you!

1754
01:28:12,391 --> 01:28:14,106
<i>- Last of the Mohicans.</i>
- Ah,

1755
01:28:14,240 --> 01:28:15,626
boy! Stunts!

1756
01:28:17,503 --> 01:28:18,416
Damn it.

1757
01:28:30,499 --> 01:28:32,630
Shit, is this rubber? Oh, God.

1758
01:28:48,265 --> 01:28:49,420
Daniel Day-Lewis!

1759
01:29:04,904 --> 01:29:06,586
Jason Bourne!

1760
01:29:21,928 --> 01:29:23,600
Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson!

1761
01:29:26,291 --> 01:29:27,483
- Give me the phone!

1762
01:29:33,129 --> 01:29:34,634
Where's the phone, stuntman?

1763
01:29:34,659 --> 01:29:36,108
We got to get this phone
to the cops.

1764
01:29:36,236 --> 01:29:37,838
-Okay.
-It's the only thing--

1765
01:30:06,252 --> 01:30:07,260
Hey, man bun!

1766
01:30:08,147 --> 01:30:09,546
Where's the phone, stuntman?

1767
01:30:10,359 --> 01:30:12,530
Jean-Claude, <i>attaque!</i>

1768
01:30:23,868 --> 01:30:25,142
I'm gonna take that.

1769
01:30:25,748 --> 01:30:26,994
Be careful of that, big fella.

1770
01:30:27,021 --> 01:30:27,834
Shut up!

1771
01:30:29,160 --> 01:30:31,488
I'm gonna go out the front
and make sure no one's there.

1772
01:30:31,695 --> 01:30:32,477
- Okay.
- All right.

1773
01:30:32,594 --> 01:30:33,661
Hey, take Jean-Claude,
would you?

1774
01:30:33,686 --> 01:30:35,083
- Okay. <i>Allons-y!</i>

1775
01:30:38,082 --> 01:30:39,451
Just you and me, stuntman.

1776
01:30:41,085 --> 01:30:41,917
Shit.

1777
01:30:54,155 --> 01:30:55,110
Colt's down.

1778
01:30:55,935 --> 01:30:57,176
Big fella got away, though.

1779
01:31:07,533 --> 01:31:10,038
You can make it. You can
make it. You can make it!

1780
01:31:11,329 --> 01:31:12,996
No! It's too dangerous!

1781
01:31:13,402 --> 01:31:14,322
Got to be stairs.

1782
01:31:14,941 --> 01:31:16,323
Okay, okay, okay, okay!

1783
01:31:32,446 --> 01:31:33,049
Colt.

1784
01:31:33,854 --> 01:31:34,811
Hey, man.

1785
01:31:38,384 --> 01:31:39,274
Look at that.

1786
01:31:40,414 --> 01:31:41,767
Yeah, makin' a movie here.

1787
01:31:43,997 --> 01:31:45,380
Could you leave us, please?

1788
01:31:50,428 --> 01:31:52,553
Ooh, Gail. So tense.

1789
01:31:54,046 --> 01:31:55,521
You remember old Dressy, right?

1790
01:31:58,411 --> 01:31:59,405
Stuntman.

1791
01:32:00,210 --> 01:32:01,665
I never forget a fist.

1792
01:32:03,347 --> 01:32:04,629
Listen, I'm gonna
need the phone.

1793
01:32:04,886 --> 01:32:05,677
Where is it?

1794
01:32:05,817 --> 01:32:07,724
It's a matter of urgency.
I need to know.

1795
01:32:09,598 --> 01:32:12,900
Right. The one that proves
that you killed Henry, not me.

1796
01:32:13,346 --> 01:32:14,123
That phone.

1797
01:32:14,232 --> 01:32:15,355
- Well...
- Yeah.

1798
01:32:15,406 --> 01:32:16,586
I'm gonna hold on to that.

1799
01:32:17,038 --> 01:32:19,123
Seems like it's the only thing
keeping me alive right now.

1800
01:32:19,410 --> 01:32:20,149
Okay.

1801
01:32:22,069 --> 01:32:23,336
You hold on to it.

1802
01:32:24,249 --> 01:32:25,216
Okay, sure.

1803
01:32:29,786 --> 01:32:31,012
What happened, Colt?

1804
01:32:31,795 --> 01:32:32,749
You know...

1805
01:32:36,048 --> 01:32:37,341
all those movies...

1806
01:32:38,138 --> 01:32:39,645
we had some laughs, right?

1807
01:32:41,713 --> 01:32:42,873
Remember Prague?

1808
01:32:43,365 --> 01:32:44,185
Remember Prague?

1809
01:32:45,329 --> 01:32:46,963
Yeah?
I made you carry me?

1810
01:32:47,858 --> 01:32:48,711
All around the city?

1811
01:32:48,779 --> 01:32:50,206
That was a very dark time.

1812
01:32:50,239 --> 01:32:51,407
Plan paraplegic.

1813
01:32:51,911 --> 01:32:52,819
Remember? Right?

1814
01:32:53,487 --> 01:32:54,354
Yeah.

1815
01:32:54,883 --> 01:32:56,503
- That was fun.
- Yeah.

1816
01:32:58,627 --> 01:32:59,627
What's wrong?

1817
01:33:00,403 --> 01:33:01,317
What's happen?

1818
01:33:04,887 --> 01:33:07,500
Police has found Henry's body
in his hotel room,

1819
01:33:07,713 --> 01:33:08,493
murdered.

1820
01:33:09,062 --> 01:33:10,035
What?

1821
01:33:10,635 --> 01:33:12,302
Colt's gone MIA.

1822
01:33:12,626 --> 01:33:13,573
But he's on a plane.

1823
01:33:13,901 --> 01:33:15,468
They said he never got on a plane.

1824
01:33:15,614 --> 01:33:16,514
What do you saying to me?

1825
01:33:16,842 --> 01:33:18,783
He's the prime suspect, Jody.

1826
01:33:19,796 --> 01:33:22,551
Gail, come on.
Are you kidding me?

1827
01:33:22,680 --> 01:33:23,898
- I know.
- Colt?

1828
01:33:24,011 --> 01:33:24,902
- Yeah.
- There's no way.

1829
01:33:24,927 --> 01:33:26,124
- That's what I said.
- There's no way!

1830
01:33:26,468 --> 01:33:27,622
What went wrong?

1831
01:33:27,827 --> 01:33:28,787
What went wrong?

1832
01:33:29,803 --> 01:33:31,813
What went wrong?
Well, as I look at it,

1833
01:33:31,860 --> 01:33:33,273
you know, you're--
you're torturing me

1834
01:33:33,298 --> 01:33:35,783
right outside your superyacht
like a Bond villain.

1835
01:33:35,837 --> 01:33:36,499
Dipshit!

1836
01:33:37,212 --> 01:33:38,673
What went wrong?

1837
01:33:39,616 --> 01:33:41,270
What went right?!

1838
01:33:44,496 --> 01:33:45,763
You changed.

1839
01:33:46,431 --> 01:33:47,704
You changed.

1840
01:33:48,943 --> 01:33:49,649
Yeah.

1841
01:33:49,948 --> 01:33:51,969
We used to be like brothers,

1842
01:33:52,783 --> 01:33:53,536
you and I.

1843
01:33:53,649 --> 01:33:56,950
Entered into the sacred bond
of actor and stuntman, man.

1844
01:33:56,975 --> 01:33:57,838
Oh, God.

1845
01:33:58,015 --> 01:33:59,909
You think Colt could murder
a human being?

1846
01:33:59,934 --> 01:34:01,262
- No, I don't.
- Did you tell them that?

1847
01:34:01,287 --> 01:34:02,170
- I said that.
- This is a man--

1848
01:34:02,195 --> 01:34:04,061
This is a man
who spent 23 minutes

1849
01:34:04,086 --> 01:34:05,534
ushering a cockroach
out of my room once,

1850
01:34:05,559 --> 01:34:06,838
and I was like, "Just stomp
on it," and he was like,

1851
01:34:06,863 --> 01:34:08,384
"No, let it live."
I mean, it's Colt.

1852
01:34:08,409 --> 01:34:10,290
I told them all of that.

1853
01:34:10,548 --> 01:34:13,167
I told him who he is--
who I thought he was.

1854
01:34:13,261 --> 01:34:14,795
Did you, emphatically?

1855
01:34:14,820 --> 01:34:16,110
- Yes, I did.
- Yeah, because he

1856
01:34:16,218 --> 01:34:18,123
was at the airport
where you sent him.

1857
01:34:18,654 --> 01:34:20,157
He would've been in karaoke with me.

1858
01:34:20,182 --> 01:34:21,464
I thought he was on the plane.

1859
01:34:21,521 --> 01:34:23,743
Don't do that.
He lied to both of us.

1860
01:34:24,247 --> 01:34:25,820
- How many movies have we done?
- Oh, I don't know.

1861
01:34:25,900 --> 01:34:27,225
Yeah, too many
to count, that's right.

1862
01:34:27,424 --> 01:34:28,972
'Cause I put you
in the contract, didn't I?

1863
01:34:29,139 --> 01:34:30,509
I put you there, right there.

1864
01:34:30,768 --> 01:34:31,855
Yeah? That's right,

1865
01:34:31,880 --> 01:34:33,422
I had the assistant,
the makeup and hair...

1866
01:34:33,472 --> 01:34:35,014
- Right.
- ...uh, trainer, and then boom,

1867
01:34:35,170 --> 01:34:36,678
Ryder's number one stuntman,

1868
01:34:36,958 --> 01:34:37,584
Colt Seavers.

1869
01:34:37,635 --> 01:34:39,495
That was me, I did that.
I did that for you.

1870
01:34:39,809 --> 01:34:41,185
What are you gonna
do for me? Huh?

1871
01:34:42,199 --> 01:34:43,225
Die, I guess?

1872
01:34:44,904 --> 01:34:45,922
Right? Die?

1873
01:34:46,076 --> 01:34:47,250
Is that the plan?

1874
01:34:49,339 --> 01:34:50,184
- Oh, my God.
- It's nothing personal.

1875
01:34:50,231 --> 01:34:51,417
Well, I'm taking it personal.

1876
01:34:51,442 --> 01:34:52,759
- Yeah, I can see that.
- The torture.

1877
01:34:52,784 --> 01:34:53,948
You know what?
It's just business.

1878
01:34:54,020 --> 01:34:55,324
- The drugging, the Taser.
- You know, it's just business.

1879
01:34:55,370 --> 01:34:56,885
I mean, Tom Ryder's
a global brand.

1880
01:34:56,910 --> 01:34:58,321
- I'm taking it personal.
- I literally move markets.

1881
01:34:58,502 --> 01:35:01,559
If I go down...
the freakin' Dow goes down.

1882
01:35:02,259 --> 01:35:05,894
If you break your back,
I replace you like this. Boom.

1883
01:35:06,494 --> 01:35:10,388
Look, I can see how you can
get so easily confused, you know?

1884
01:35:11,434 --> 01:35:13,421
You put on my clothes, all right?

1885
01:35:13,652 --> 01:35:16,112
You walk a mile in my shoes
you start to get some attention

1886
01:35:16,167 --> 01:35:18,091
and you get your little article in Variety

1887
01:35:18,116 --> 01:35:19,126
or whatever it is.

1888
01:35:19,151 --> 01:35:21,103
- 10 top stunts man or whatever the shit.
- Oh my God, Variety article.

1889
01:35:21,130 --> 01:35:22,336
- Are you serious?
- Doesn't really matter.

1890
01:35:22,384 --> 01:35:23,917
- Nobody read it.
- The Variety article?

1891
01:35:24,163 --> 01:35:26,310
But you start to feel like
you're something special.

1892
01:35:26,338 --> 01:35:27,904
I didn't even do the interview!

1893
01:35:28,632 --> 01:35:29,572
This is what's happened, right?

1894
01:35:29,832 --> 01:35:31,006
And muddy's up the waters,

1895
01:35:31,507 --> 01:35:33,114
and that's what I got
to nip it in the bud.

1896
01:35:33,251 --> 01:35:34,371
I got to protect the asset.

1897
01:35:55,836 --> 01:35:56,549
Come on.

1898
01:35:57,663 --> 01:35:59,556
You know, if you'd just
stuck to your job

1899
01:35:59,581 --> 01:36:01,489
instead of trying to
hog the spotlight,

1900
01:36:01,889 --> 01:36:03,975
this wouldn't have happened.
I mean, Henry wouldn't be

1901
01:36:04,000 --> 01:36:05,848
on the scene, his accident
wouldn't have happened,

1902
01:36:05,873 --> 01:36:06,732
your accident...

1903
01:36:07,359 --> 01:36:08,240
freaky little fall.

1904
01:36:08,265 --> 01:36:10,249
'Cause you just
push my buttons, man.

1905
01:36:10,455 --> 01:36:11,336
Wait a second. What?

1906
01:36:13,075 --> 01:36:13,855
What?

1907
01:36:15,368 --> 01:36:16,596
What did you say
about my accident?

1908
01:36:17,893 --> 01:36:19,420
Well, you know,
you pushed me over the edge.

1909
01:36:19,640 --> 01:36:21,959
You literally pushed a button.
I mean, you didn't--

1910
01:36:22,433 --> 01:36:23,473
<i>I mean, I pushed the button.</i>

1911
01:36:28,102 --> 01:36:29,506
<i>I had to crank it up a notch.</i>

1912
01:36:37,240 --> 01:36:38,376
That was you?

1913
01:36:38,530 --> 01:36:39,390
Yeah.

1914
01:36:43,718 --> 01:36:45,661
Had to teach you
a little lesson, didn't I?

1915
01:36:46,181 --> 01:36:47,627
Got a little
too big for your boots,

1916
01:36:47,671 --> 01:36:48,413
ain't you?

1917
01:36:49,192 --> 01:36:50,633
Henry's no different, you know.

1918
01:36:52,177 --> 01:36:53,897
Hey. You do your own stunts?

1919
01:36:55,449 --> 01:36:56,866
Do I do my own stunts?

1920
01:36:56,902 --> 01:36:58,595
In front of all those people,
that's humiliating.

1921
01:36:59,925 --> 01:37:01,508
And yeah, I'm gonna
kick you into next week.

1922
01:37:05,480 --> 01:37:06,537
But then Gail, you know...

1923
01:37:06,853 --> 01:37:09,091
- Remember Gail, right?
- I've known her for 15 years.

1924
01:37:09,116 --> 01:37:10,566
Oh, yeah. I forget, 'cause
you've been out of the game

1925
01:37:10,591 --> 01:37:12,046
- so long, you know?
- I introduced the two of you.

1926
01:37:12,071 --> 01:37:13,706
Calls me up and says,
"It doesn't look good."

1927
01:37:13,820 --> 01:37:16,352
Bad for marketing and renting,

1928
01:37:16,612 --> 01:37:18,560
and blah, blah, blah,
and murder and...

1929
01:37:18,947 --> 01:37:20,698
I know, I-I-I d--

1930
01:37:20,918 --> 01:37:24,016
I real-- I really
don't need this right now.

1931
01:37:25,193 --> 01:37:26,363
Fucking Henry!

1932
01:37:26,769 --> 01:37:27,844
Don't worry about it.

1933
01:37:28,758 --> 01:37:29,757
You lay low...

1934
01:37:31,238 --> 01:37:32,485
and I will handle everything.

1935
01:35:34,877 --> 01:35:37,647
But maybe we don't know people
as well as we think we do.

1936
01:35:38,424 --> 01:35:40,247
- Oh, my God.
- You know?

1937
01:35:42,098 --> 01:35:43,207
Oh, my God, it's Colt.

1938
01:35:43,264 --> 01:35:43,906
- Give me the...
- No.

1939
01:35:43,931 --> 01:35:45,277
- What are you doing?
- Gail, get off the pho--

1940
01:35:45,302 --> 01:35:47,407
- Oh! What are you doing?
- Oh, my-- Jesus Christ, Gail!

1941
01:35:47,499 --> 01:35:49,442
- Oh, my-- Oh, I'm so sorry.
- Oh, my God.

1942
01:35:50,146 --> 01:35:51,097
- Let me help you.
- No, stop it.

1943
01:35:51,170 --> 01:35:52,150
- Let me take it up to--
- Do you know what?

1944
01:35:52,175 --> 01:35:53,397
- Just give me a minute.
- Yep.

1945
01:35:53,422 --> 01:35:54,350
Just give me a minute.

1946
01:37:33,102 --> 01:37:34,320
This plan was so simple.

1947
01:37:35,462 --> 01:37:37,439
Yeah, we were gonna put
Henry's body on ice

1948
01:37:37,464 --> 01:37:38,732
so it doesn't decompose.

1949
01:37:38,757 --> 01:37:41,807
We could pull you out from
that rock you crawled under.

1950
01:37:41,855 --> 01:37:44,272
- My life, yep.
- You know, scan your face.

1951
01:37:45,276 --> 01:37:46,696
Stick you
on the murder video.

1952
01:37:47,015 --> 01:37:48,720
Drug you, drive you
and Henry's body

1953
01:37:48,720 --> 01:37:51,419
off the Sydney Harbour Bridge,
in your car-- boom.

1954
01:37:51,745 --> 01:37:54,651
You got murder, suicide.
So simple. Boom.

1955
01:37:54,715 --> 01:37:56,178
Cut. Check the gate.

1956
01:37:56,372 --> 01:37:57,172
Move on. Beautiful.

1957
01:37:57,546 --> 01:37:59,719
We have different ideas of what simple is.

1958
01:38:00,060 --> 01:38:01,293
Y-You just didn't
stay down, did you?

1959
01:38:01,568 --> 01:38:03,008
You had to, like, uh,
create a big scene,

1960
01:38:03,045 --> 01:38:04,561
like Colt Seavers does.

1961
01:38:05,181 --> 01:38:06,981
Dipshit Doone sends you where?

1962
01:38:07,403 --> 01:38:10,396
To the freaking crime scene
back to the hotel.

1963
01:38:10,550 --> 01:38:11,610
Oh, brilliant.

1964
01:38:11,737 --> 01:38:13,484
That's nice. Great.
Good job.

1965
01:38:14,042 --> 01:38:16,302
Now I got a witness.
Now you leave me with no options, Colt.

1966
01:38:16,469 --> 01:38:18,469
Now I'm- I'm now gonna improvise.

1967
01:38:18,677 --> 01:38:19,744
So say goodbye to Doone.

1968
01:38:19,792 --> 01:38:20,379
What?

1969
01:38:20,499 --> 01:38:21,512
He's gotta die.

1970
01:38:21,831 --> 01:38:23,098
What?
Whaddaya mean i gotta di-

1971
01:38:23,438 --> 01:38:24,205
No, no!

1972
01:38:24,286 --> 01:38:25,519
Don't do this. Listen to me.

1973
01:38:25,566 --> 01:38:26,073
Shit.

1974
01:38:26,886 --> 01:38:27,806
God damn.

1975
01:38:28,892 --> 01:38:29,998
You're killing Doone.

1976
01:38:30,678 --> 01:38:31,872
This is insane.

1977
01:38:32,612 --> 01:38:34,158
Well, this is on you. man.

1978
01:38:34,183 --> 01:38:35,124
- This is all you.
- Insane.

1979
01:38:35,210 --> 01:38:36,290
This is insane.

1980
01:38:36,322 --> 01:38:37,930
But no, then you got Kevin.

1981
01:38:37,991 --> 01:38:38,924
Uuh... Kevin,

1982
01:38:39,564 --> 01:38:41,150
spoiler alert Kevin, run!

1983
01:38:41,258 --> 01:38:42,784
No, he had a good idea
he ain't gonna run.

1984
01:38:42,809 --> 01:38:44,468
- Kevin, I'd run.
- Don't run, Kev.

1985
01:38:45,031 --> 01:38:46,121
You were good, right?

1986
01:38:46,235 --> 01:38:46,932
Quick wits.

1987
01:38:46,957 --> 01:38:49,313
If it wasn't for him, the cops
would have found Henry's body.

1988
01:38:51,099 --> 01:38:52,023
Think about this.

1989
01:38:52,104 --> 01:38:53,491
- I am.
- Sleep on it.

1990
01:38:53,543 --> 01:38:57,095
If killing Kevin is a good idea,
it'll still be a good idea in the morning.

1991
01:38:57,120 --> 01:38:58,829
Colt, now he's a witness.
Now he's gotta go.

1992
01:38:58,935 --> 01:38:59,407
What?

1993
01:38:59,635 --> 01:39:00,308
What, no!

1994
01:39:00,441 --> 01:39:01,268
Hang on! What-

1995
01:39:01,321 --> 01:39:03,656
Oh, my God. You killing--
You killing Kevin.

1996
01:39:03,808 --> 01:39:04,700
He's killing Kevin.

1997
01:39:05,860 --> 01:39:07,990
- He's killing Kevin.
- She's gotta kill that sound.

1998
01:39:16,424 --> 01:39:17,804
I don't know when it stops.

1999
01:39:18,367 --> 01:39:20,134
Just adding up one by one.

2000
01:39:20,234 --> 01:39:21,407
All on your plate.

2001
01:39:24,736 --> 01:39:26,129
It's like pancake...

2002
01:39:27,163 --> 01:39:28,163
Still kind of works.

2003
01:39:28,533 --> 01:39:29,773
Sort of writes itself, actually.

2004
01:39:30,106 --> 01:39:31,892
- It's not writing itself.
- Yeah.

2005
01:39:32,273 --> 01:39:33,273
You're writing it.

2006
01:39:33,941 --> 01:39:35,447
Crippled stuntman,

2007
01:39:35,549 --> 01:39:36,582
falls from Grace.

2008
01:39:37,540 --> 01:39:40,434
Flies to Australia in a bitter rage,
because...

2009
01:39:41,512 --> 01:39:42,632
Tom Ryder,

2010
01:39:42,753 --> 01:39:45,633
two times Oscar nominees
working with his ex-girlfriend.

2011
01:39:45,984 --> 01:39:48,024
- This is terrible!
- Dresses up as the movie star

2012
01:39:48,049 --> 01:39:50,322
and goes to the club
to fill once in his life.

2013
01:39:50,869 --> 01:39:51,616
Relevant.

2014
01:39:52,340 --> 01:39:53,926
Gets high as balls goes to the

2015
01:39:53,951 --> 01:39:55,178
- This is your idea?
- Pennelton Hotel

2016
01:39:55,207 --> 01:39:56,107
and kick them and

2017
01:39:56,132 --> 01:39:57,717
- Tom, you should not write.
- find the new stunt double's door.

2018
01:40:00,836 --> 01:40:03,009
lands on both the tragic doubles
at the bottom of the Sidney Harbour.

2019
01:40:03,123 --> 01:40:04,143
The plot is heavy.

2020
01:40:04,307 --> 01:40:06,093
Or getting tangled in exposition.

2021
01:40:06,256 --> 01:40:07,769
The murder caught on tape.

2022
01:40:08,004 --> 01:40:09,723
Loose the last part of the suicide.

2023
01:40:09,817 --> 01:40:11,683
You lose the audience if it’s too much.

2024
01:40:40,021 --> 01:40:41,841
I can think of a few
other people who can't.

2025
01:40:42,357 --> 01:40:45,064
We could bring Dan up here,
maybe Jody, perhaps.

2026
01:40:45,376 --> 01:40:46,836
I mean, I like Jody,
but you know.

2027
01:40:46,861 --> 01:40:47,860
There's no phone.

2028
01:40:49,882 --> 01:40:51,660
Okay? That's the twist.

2029
01:40:51,922 --> 01:40:52,675
No phone.

2030
01:40:52,830 --> 01:40:55,026
He shot it out of my hand.

2031
01:40:55,802 --> 01:40:56,980
Up there, go check.

2032
01:40:57,457 --> 01:40:59,115
You, too, all of you.
I'll wait.

2033
01:41:00,677 --> 01:41:02,577
-  He shot it.
- You didn't know you did that?

2034
01:41:03,162 --> 01:41:05,397
It's crazy. I've been wanting
to tell you this whole time.

2035
01:41:05,468 --> 01:41:06,328
No, he didn't.

2036
01:41:06,468 --> 01:41:08,290
- I was by the door frame.
- No.

2037
01:41:08,587 --> 01:41:10,137
And he shoots it
out of my hands!

2038
01:41:10,178 --> 01:41:12,010
- No.
- Take the ties off.

2039
01:41:12,150 --> 01:41:14,053
- Oh, my God, what a relief.
- That's crazy.

2040
01:41:14,241 --> 01:41:16,108
You were right about one thing,
that was the only thing

2041
01:41:16,133 --> 01:41:17,261
keeping you alive.

2042
01:41:19,589 --> 01:41:21,068
I really wish you could see

2043
01:41:21,122 --> 01:41:22,914
what Jody's gonna do
with <i>Metalstorm.</i>

2044
01:41:22,939 --> 01:41:23,879
It's gonna be awesome.

2045
01:41:24,074 --> 01:41:25,134
And honestly...

2046
01:41:26,787 --> 01:41:27,594
it's gonna be a banger.

2047
01:39:57,851 --> 01:39:58,548
Kills him,

2048
01:39:58,922 --> 01:40:00,503
and an empathetic last stunt

2049
01:40:11,907 --> 01:40:13,722
No, I don’t think they give a shit.

2050
01:40:13,902 --> 01:40:14,775
Actually, Colt...

2051
01:40:14,835 --> 01:40:16,682
Tom, you need carbs!

2052
01:40:17,066 --> 01:40:17,949
Where's the phone?

2053
01:40:17,990 --> 01:40:20,142
You need carbs.

2054
01:40:20,925 --> 01:40:22,419
I need the phone.

2055
01:40:22,479 --> 01:40:25,059
Your brain runs on glucose.

2056
01:40:25,360 --> 01:40:27,173
Get your chef to make grilled cheese.

2057
01:40:27,524 --> 01:40:28,071
Okay?

2058
01:40:28,104 --> 01:40:29,631
It'll change your life right now.

2059
01:40:29,683 --> 01:40:30,597
Colt, you're the fall guy.

2060
01:40:31,297 --> 01:40:32,243
You the fall guy.

2061
01:40:33,817 --> 01:40:34,717
Where is the phone?

2062
01:40:36,055 --> 01:40:38,337
I mean... you can taking hits all night.

2063
01:40:38,411 --> 01:40:39,205
But, you know what?

2064
01:41:38,273 --> 01:41:39,788
Wish you didn't
break that bond, bro.

2065
01:41:40,515 --> 01:41:41,548
Wish you didn't break that bond.

2066
01:41:41,901 --> 01:41:43,932
Time for a drink, mate. Eh?

2067
01:41:44,547 --> 01:41:45,480
There we go.

2068
01:41:46,952 --> 01:41:48,613
Help!

2069
01:41:49,341 --> 01:41:50,534
- Help!

2070
01:41:50,559 --> 01:41:52,473
- Shut up.
- Help!

2071
01:41:52,582 --> 01:41:53,628
Shut up, mate.

2072
01:42:02,713 --> 01:42:03,601
There.

2073
01:42:04,561 --> 01:42:05,883
This fire gag's real.

2074
01:42:20,529 --> 01:42:21,883
Come on, guys, start the boat.

2075
01:42:22,001 --> 01:42:23,367
He's gone the wrong way.

2076
01:42:35,812 --> 01:42:36,566
Shit!

2077
01:43:48,565 --> 01:43:49,698
Oh, Colt.

2078
01:43:51,086 --> 01:43:51,502
Colt?

2079
01:43:51,806 --> 01:43:53,363
- Hey.
- <i>What's going on?</i>

2080
01:43:53,463 --> 01:43:54,112
What'd you sing?

2081
01:43:54,137 --> 01:43:55,483
- What?
- <i>At karaoke.</i>

2082
01:43:55,781 --> 01:43:57,422
- <i>I'm sorry I didn't make it.</i>
- It doesn't matter.

2083
01:43:57,447 --> 01:43:59,222
Listen. Everyone's saying
you killed Henry.

2084
01:43:59,247 --> 01:44:00,208
- <i>Oh, that's not true.</i>
- What's happening?

2085
01:44:00,233 --> 01:44:01,998
You're gonna hear a lot
of things that aren't true.

2086
01:44:02,023 --> 01:44:03,217
<i>I just wanted to say that,</i>

2087
01:44:03,861 --> 01:44:04,847
<i>when I first got here,</i>

2088
01:44:04,960 --> 01:44:07,233
when you asked how I was doing
and I gave you the thumbs-up,

2089
01:44:07,307 --> 01:44:08,783
when you were like,
"That's stunt guy bullshit,"

2090
01:44:08,808 --> 01:44:10,686
and you're right,
it's total cliché,

2091
01:44:10,859 --> 01:44:11,272
but,

2092
01:44:11,478 --> 01:44:12,457
you know, there's a
reason you don't see

2093
01:44:12,457 --> 01:44:13,725
the thumbs-down stunt guy.

2094
01:44:16,353 --> 01:44:17,385
You know,

2095
01:44:17,992 --> 01:44:19,032
it's kind of part
of our training.

2096
01:44:19,179 --> 01:44:20,987
Right? You know,
you get hit by a car,

2097
01:44:21,400 --> 01:44:22,907
you get thrown out of a window,

2098
01:44:22,907 --> 01:44:24,810
you get set on fire,
you give the thumbs-up.

2099
01:44:25,337 --> 01:44:27,274
<i>But, uh, after my accident--</i>

2100
01:44:27,992 --> 01:44:30,635
turns out was not an accident,
by the way--

2101
01:44:31,775 --> 01:44:32,883
I, uh...

2102
01:44:34,655 --> 01:44:35,725
I wasn't okay.

2103
01:44:37,504 --> 01:44:39,319
And not because I broke my back,

2104
01:44:39,319 --> 01:44:41,432
because I just felt
like a huge...

2105
01:44:43,353 --> 01:44:44,367
failure.

2106
01:44:48,152 --> 01:44:49,758
And I realized that, uh...

2107
01:44:50,143 --> 01:44:51,800
you know, I'm not invincible.

2108
01:44:52,578 --> 01:44:53,724
Huge shocker.

2109
01:44:55,292 --> 01:44:58,383
And I thought maybe
I wasn't so special

2110
01:44:58,409 --> 01:44:59,595
or something, so I, uh...

2111
01:45:00,576 --> 01:45:02,342
just figured that
the thumbs-down version of me

2112
01:45:02,342 --> 01:45:04,688
wasn't what you got
into it for, so I disappeared.

2113
01:45:05,965 --> 01:45:08,113
But, you know, I didn't
just disappear after you, uh...

2114
01:45:09,251 --> 01:45:10,482
 just disappeared on,

2115
01:45:11,734 --> 01:45:14,987
on, uh, myself... too.

2116
01:45:17,227 --> 01:45:18,560
Anyway, I'm sorry.

2117
01:45:19,467 --> 01:45:21,222
You deserved more than that.
I'm sorry.

2118
01:45:21,857 --> 01:45:23,192
I just wanted you to be honest.

2119
01:45:24,565 --> 01:45:27,631
You know, honestly,
it, uh, all hurts.

2120
01:45:33,333 --> 01:45:34,693
Getting hit by a car hurts.

2121
01:45:35,810 --> 01:45:37,310
Getting thrown out
of a window hurts.

2122
01:45:38,407 --> 01:45:40,343
Getting set on fire
really hurts.

2123
01:45:41,991 --> 01:45:43,064
But, uh...

2124
01:45:48,059 --> 01:45:50,389
...none of it ever hurt as much
as not being with you.

2125
01:45:53,338 --> 01:45:54,263
Where are you?

2126
01:45:56,487 --> 01:45:58,562
Is that from a movie
or did I just make that up?

2127
01:46:00,032 --> 01:46:00,892
It's pretty good.

2128
01:46:01,005 --> 01:46:02,501
- There he is!
- You can use it if you want.

2129
01:46:06,315 --> 01:46:07,261
No, please...

2130
01:46:07,622 --> 01:46:09,614
<i>For what it's worth,
I'm still in love with you.</i>

2131
01:46:11,471 --> 01:46:13,806
And I don't think you should
give up on that happy ending.

2132
01:46:13,986 --> 01:46:14,599
Colt.

2133
01:46:16,048 --> 01:46:16,994
<i>I got to go.</i>

2134
01:46:17,376 --> 01:46:18,253
Colt.

2135
01:46:19,509 --> 01:46:20,442
Wait, Colt.

2136
01:47:28,713 --> 01:47:30,738
That's a wrap on Colt Seavers.

2137
01:47:43,593 --> 01:47:44,246
Gail?

2138
01:47:45,179 --> 01:47:46,066
<i>Jody.</i>

2139
01:47:48,914 --> 01:47:49,734

01:47:51,546 --> 01:47:52,635
<i>Colt's dead.</i>

2141
01:48:05,823 --> 01:48:09,001
Police are investigating
an explosion on Sydney Harbour

2142
01:48:09,001 --> 01:48:10,657
just outside the Opera House,

2143
01:48:10,773 --> 01:48:13,017
where it appears a boat
has collided with...

2144
01:48:36,405 --> 01:48:38,987
<i>...an alleged suicide
of Colt Seavers,</i>

2145
01:48:38,987 --> 01:48:42,306
<i>the man responsible for the
recent murder of Henry Herrera.</i>

2146
01:49:04,950 --> 01:49:06,181
Hey. Hey.

2147
01:49:09,150 --> 01:49:10,921
Looking for Stunt Coordinator
Dan Tucker.

2148
01:49:11,481 --> 01:49:12,746
- You seen him?
- No.

2149
01:49:20,341 --> 01:49:21,688
Hey! You two.

2150
01:49:22,591 --> 01:49:25,225
Helmets off. Looking for
Stunt Coordinator Dan Tucker.

2151
01:49:36,772 --> 01:49:38,878
<i>Following
a dramatic boat explosion</i>

2152
01:49:38,958 --> 01:49:41,422
<i>on Sydney Harbour, police are
currently investigating</i>

2153
01:49:41,615 --> 01:49:44,630
<i>the suicide of
American stuntman Colt Seavers.</i>

2154
01:50:05,246 --> 01:50:07,944
Jody, you need
to be quiet. Don't say a word.

2155
01:50:22,312 --> 01:50:23,630
Wait, wait. No.

2156
01:50:32,806 --> 01:50:34,100
Jody...

2157
01:50:45,423 --> 01:50:49,278
You think you can come
to my set and sneak up on me?

2158
01:50:56,619 --> 01:50:57,981
Wait!

2159
01:50:59,933 --> 01:51:01,724
It's me. It's me.

2160
01:51:03,188 --> 01:51:04,499
Remember?

2161
01:51:05,172 --> 01:51:06,559
Jesus Christ.

2162
01:51:07,958 --> 01:51:08,939
I knew it.

2163
01:51:08,939 --> 01:51:09,884
- I knew it.

2164
01:51:11,777 --> 01:51:13,130
I knew you were alive.

2165
01:51:13,483 --> 01:51:14,247
Three shows a day,

2166
01:51:14,272 --> 01:51:15,407
six days a week for three years.

2167
01:51:15,936 --> 01:51:17,806
The <i>Miami Vice</i> stunt show.

2168
01:51:19,055 --> 01:51:20,015
You remembered.

2169
01:51:20,040 --> 01:51:22,543
Yes.
I'm happy you're alive, Colt.

2170
01:51:23,418 --> 01:51:25,046
Colt, I'm so happy you're alive.

2171
01:51:25,071 --> 01:51:26,319
- I knew it.
- Oh, my God.

2172
01:51:26,361 --> 01:51:27,946
- What were you doing...
- Nice work with the pen.

2173
01:51:28,332 --> 01:51:29,288
- So sorry.
- No, it was great.

2174
01:51:29,369 --> 01:51:31,538
You got it out just in time.
I think the ink poisoning didn't set in.

2175
01:51:31,691 --> 01:51:33,513
-  Chef's kiss.
- What's going on?

2176
01:51:33,832 --> 01:51:35,928
- Huh?
- Everyone's saying that you killed Henry.

2177
01:51:36,492 --> 01:51:38,228
Ryder killed Henry.
He framed me.

2178
01:51:38,253 --> 01:51:39,259
There's footage of you.

2179
01:51:39,284 --> 01:51:40,151
Well, he deepfaked me.

2180
01:51:40,664 --> 01:51:41,133
What?

2181
01:51:41,473 --> 01:51:42,813
They do it all the time
on the Internet.

2182
01:51:43,348 --> 01:51:45,745
They take Tom Cruise's face,
and they put it on yours.

2183
01:51:45,947 --> 01:51:47,175
And you can't tell
the difference.

2184
01:51:47,175 --> 01:51:48,583
No. Okay, so where's
the real footage

2185
01:51:48,583 --> 01:51:50,425
of Ryder killing Henry?
How do we get it?

2186
01:51:50,478 --> 01:51:52,624
It was on Ryder's phone, and
then it got destroyed because

2187
01:51:52,649 --> 01:51:54,227
Dan's <i>Last of the Mohicans</i>
plan didn't work out.

2188
01:51:54,252 --> 01:51:54,658
What?

2189
01:51:54,683 --> 01:51:57,376
It's not his fault, you know?
He called tomahawk first, okay.

2190
01:51:57,950 --> 01:51:58,983
I got "blanks only."

2191
01:51:59,136 --> 01:52:00,411
And it was going
pretty well, actually,

2192
01:52:00,436 --> 01:52:01,353
and then Dressler showed up.

2193
01:52:01,378 --> 01:52:02,906
So he, you know, he does this, like,

2194
01:52:03,694 --> 01:52:04,707
Jason Bourne shit.

2195
01:52:05,356 --> 01:52:06,690
I have so many questions.

2196
01:52:07,838 --> 01:52:08,538
Okay.

2197
01:52:09,198 --> 01:52:10,573
Who else knows you're alive?

2198
01:52:11,060 --> 01:52:11,701
No one.

2199
01:52:12,366 --> 01:52:12,808
Great.

2200
01:52:12,833 --> 01:52:13,987
No, that's the point.
I mean, I figure

2201
01:52:14,012 --> 01:52:15,653
we can't finish the movie
unless they think I'm dead.

2202
01:52:15,678 --> 01:52:16,540
What movie?

2203
01:52:17,775 --> 01:52:18,510
<i>Metalstorm.</i>

2204
01:52:18,535 --> 01:52:19,521
What about <i>Metalstorm?</i>

2205
01:52:19,943 --> 01:52:21,351
If they think I'm dead,
they'll come back and finish.

2206
01:52:21,585 --> 01:52:22,823
- Who?
- Ryder.

2207
01:52:22,863 --> 01:52:24,289
- Finish what?
- The movie.

2208
01:52:24,289 --> 01:52:25,780
<i>- Metalstorm?</i>
- Exactly.

2209
01:52:25,806 --> 01:52:27,754
- Are you insane? You are insane.
- What?

2210
01:52:27,779 --> 01:52:29,627
You need to be
burning your fingerprints off,

2211
01:52:29,652 --> 01:52:30,780
and you need to be
getting across the border

2212
01:52:30,805 --> 01:52:31,598
as fast as possible.

2213
01:52:32,111 --> 01:52:34,250
We're gonna hide you
until we can clear your name.

2214
01:52:34,275 --> 01:52:36,205
None of it matters anymore.
It's just a stupid movie.

2215
01:52:36,345 --> 01:52:37,126
- What?
- It's a stupid movie.

2216
01:52:37,338 --> 01:52:38,178
Don't say that.

2217
01:52:38,800 --> 01:52:41,035
That's <i>Metalstorm</i>
you're talking about.

2218
01:52:41,402 --> 01:52:43,473
That's the movie you spent
your whole life trying to make.

2219
01:52:44,312 --> 01:52:45,134
Who knows?

2220
01:52:45,385 --> 01:52:47,468
You might inspire a whole
generation of little Jodys

2221
01:52:47,493 --> 01:52:49,768
to pick up cameras
and make their own movies.

2222
01:52:52,531 --> 01:52:54,009
You're just-- you're special.

2223
01:52:55,619 --> 01:52:57,817
And all of us get to be
a part of something special

2224
01:52:57,817 --> 01:52:59,532
because it comes from you.

2225
01:53:00,956 --> 01:53:03,619
I obviously failed
at getting us our happy ending,

2226
01:53:03,644 --> 01:53:05,220
but I'll be damned
if I'm gonna let

2227
01:53:05,220 --> 01:53:07,183
Space Cowboy and Aliena
not have theirs.

2228
01:53:13,468 --> 01:53:14,312
Jody, my love!

2229
01:53:14,966 --> 01:53:16,000
- One sec!
- I'm coming...

2230
01:53:17,053 --> 01:53:17,639
Stop it.

2231
01:53:17,915 --> 01:53:18,383
Gail.

2232
01:53:18,848 --> 01:53:19,641
She's in on it.

2233
01:53:19,695 --> 01:53:20,608
- What?
- Yes.

2234
01:53:20,633 --> 01:53:21,703
- Okay, come on.
- Let's just kiss a little bit first.

2235
01:53:21,728 --> 01:53:24,687
No, come on, we g-- got to get
you in the bathroom, please.

2236
01:53:26,137 --> 01:53:26,764
Come on.

2237
01:53:28,597 --> 01:53:29,423
Come on.

2238
01:53:30,586 --> 01:53:31,483
Christ!

2239
01:53:33,083 --> 01:53:34,278
Got to work.

2240
01:53:35,061 --> 01:53:36,228
You all right in there,
my darling?

2241
01:53:36,361 --> 01:53:38,936
Here, this-- Take this soap
and rub it on my belly.

2242
01:53:40,697 --> 01:53:41,597
Get in the bedroom.

2243
01:53:42,399 --> 01:53:44,831
- Okay. Colt. Are you good? Okay.
- Okay. Yeah.

2244
01:53:44,938 --> 01:53:46,658
- Be quiet. Don't make a sound.
- Jod?

2245
01:53:47,222 --> 01:53:48,531
- My head. The head.
- What?

2246
01:53:50,969 --> 01:53:52,163
- Hi!
- Hey.

2247
01:53:52,371 --> 01:53:53,585
Hello, you.

2248
01:53:53,990 --> 01:53:55,458
Aw, come here.

2249
01:53:56,597 --> 01:53:58,161
Aw, how's my favourite director?

2250
01:53:58,254 --> 01:53:59,535
- Uh, a bit emotional, you know.
- Oh, no--

2251
01:53:59,834 --> 01:54:00,514
 Jesus.

2252
01:54:00,539 --> 01:54:02,355
Like Johnny and Amber
have just been here.

2253
01:54:02,488 --> 01:54:04,068
I just need to vent,
'cause it's been...

2254
01:54:04,570 --> 01:54:06,530
- it's just been so much.
- I know. I know.

2255
01:54:06,859 --> 01:54:08,653
- I'm so sorry about Colt.
- Thank you.

2256
01:54:08,678 --> 01:54:09,758
You know, it's such a shame, but,

2257
01:54:10,404 --> 01:54:11,022
what a mess.

2258
01:54:11,151 --> 01:54:12,224
- Right.
- Who knew?

2259
01:54:12,583 --> 01:54:14,289
- Yeah.
- I mean, I tried to help him.

2260
01:54:14,289 --> 01:54:17,095
I hope you know that, but
sometimes you can't help people

2261
01:54:17,120 --> 01:54:18,194
who don't want to be saved.

2262
01:54:18,194 --> 01:54:18,917
- Right.
- But...

2263
01:54:19,598 --> 01:54:20,544
silver lining

2264
01:54:20,636 --> 01:54:23,578
to this very dark cloud.

2265
01:54:23,951 --> 01:54:25,240
I've got Ryder to come back.

2266
01:54:25,633 --> 01:54:27,137
- And I have a plan.
- Really?

2267
01:54:27,639 --> 01:54:29,363
But we're not
gonna be able to do

2268
01:54:29,388 --> 01:54:31,347
your big third act set piece,

2269
01:54:31,566 --> 01:54:32,183
the car jump.

2270
01:54:32,580 --> 01:54:35,378
It is an impossible jump,
especially now with Colt gone.

2271
01:54:35,403 --> 01:54:35,872
Dead.

2272
01:54:36,918 --> 01:54:37,425
He's gone.

2273
01:54:37,673 --> 01:54:39,047
- He's so dead.
- Stay with me.

2274
01:54:39,197 --> 01:54:40,240
I spoke to Venti.

2275
01:54:41,041 --> 01:54:42,781
She says that she can do it
in VFX.

2276
01:54:43,079 --> 01:54:43,807
The car jump.

2277
01:54:43,860 --> 01:54:44,967
All we need to focus on

2278
01:54:45,460 --> 01:54:46,560
is Ryder's new,

2279
01:54:46,693 --> 01:54:49,770
final, bombastic monologue.

2280
01:54:50,143 --> 01:54:51,043
I've read the pages.

2281
01:54:51,427 --> 01:54:53,033
God, you smashed it.
I knew you would.

2282
01:54:53,140 --> 01:54:54,333
- We're gonna get him covered.
- Yeah.

2283
01:54:54,573 --> 01:54:55,613
You, meanwhile...

2284
01:54:57,239 --> 01:54:59,166
please go and rest up in Fiji,
on me.

2285
01:54:59,787 --> 01:55:00,374
You know?

2286
01:55:00,720 --> 01:55:02,300
Plop yourself on a beach.

2287
01:55:03,057 --> 01:55:04,817
And I'm gonna take care
of all of it...

2288
01:55:05,058 --> 01:55:05,611
...for you.

2289
01:55:05,764 --> 01:55:06,343
Gail.

2290
01:55:06,616 --> 01:55:08,069
You've got so much to process.

2291
01:55:08,109 --> 01:55:10,138
- No.
- I can take care of all of it.

2292
01:55:10,618 --> 01:55:11,706
This is my movie.

2293
01:55:12,379 --> 01:55:13,794
Now, listen to me.

2294
01:55:13,994 --> 01:55:15,260
I've learned so much from you.

2295
01:55:15,285 --> 01:55:16,913
- I know. Thank you.
- And I'm very grateful.

2296
01:55:18,056 --> 01:55:20,033
But the lesson I stand by now,

2297
01:55:20,354 --> 01:55:21,681
- that you've taught me...
- Yeah. Yeah.

2298
01:55:21,854 --> 01:55:22,749
You fall down,

2299
01:55:23,843 --> 01:55:25,004
you get right back up.

2300
01:55:28,396 --> 01:55:30,398
I am directing this movie, yeah.

2301
01:55:30,398 --> 01:55:31,798
Oh, my God, that's my girl.

2302
01:55:31,905 --> 01:55:33,893
- It went in. I'm so proud of you.
- Good. Okay.

2303
01:55:34,228 --> 01:55:35,170
Thank you. All right,

2304
01:55:35,195 --> 01:55:36,430
- let's get you out of here.
- One last thing.

2305
01:55:37,047 --> 01:55:37,743
Have you seen Dan?

2306
01:55:37,875 --> 01:55:39,439
Nope. I think he's
by the taco truck.

2307
01:55:39,464 --> 01:55:41,024
He's probably over there somewhere.
Thank you so much.

2308
01:55:41,049 --> 01:55:42,179
- I'm proud of you.
- Thank you.

2309
01:55:42,204 --> 01:55:43,678
Thanks for the pep talk.
Okay, buh-bye.

2310
01:55:43,703 --> 01:55:45,267
- Love you, darling.
- Love you, too. Bye!

2311
01:55:47,660 --> 01:55:49,146
You're gonna finish the movie.

2312
01:55:49,233 --> 01:55:51,354
No, I'm gonna clear your name.

2313
01:55:51,739 --> 01:55:53,171
Why can't we do both?

2314
01:55:53,538 --> 01:55:54,746
I think we can.

2315
01:55:54,771 --> 01:55:56,117
We're gonna bring him to set,

2316
01:55:56,350 --> 01:55:57,799
in a controlled environment,

2317
01:55:58,152 --> 01:55:59,439
and then we surround him...

2318
01:55:59,465 --> 01:56:02,029
And we beat the shit out of him.

2319
01:56:02,095 --> 01:56:02,682
No.

2320
01:56:03,099 --> 01:56:04,983
We're gonna force
a confession out of him

2321
01:56:05,130 --> 01:56:06,530
by putting him in a scene.

2322
01:56:06,742 --> 01:56:08,723
- Right.
- You know, he always forgets he's mic'd.

2323
01:56:09,049 --> 01:56:09,749
That's better.

2324
01:56:09,774 --> 01:56:11,237
I just don't know
how to do it yet.

2325
01:56:15,514 --> 01:56:16,893
I know how to do that.

2326
01:56:18,895 --> 01:56:20,115
Make him do his own stunt.

2327
01:56:21,363 --> 01:56:22,367
The impossible jump.

2328
01:56:22,527 --> 01:56:24,431
Then we beat the shit
out of him.

2329
01:56:40,459 --> 01:56:41,259
It's high noon

2330
01:56:41,284 --> 01:56:42,638
at the edge of
the universe, folks.

2331
01:56:44,343 --> 01:56:47,570
Now, we're facing
a powerful enemy.

2332
01:56:48,773 --> 01:56:52,504
An alien species born of
the worst of humanity's traits.

2333
01:56:53,915 --> 01:56:55,672
Well, what our enemy doesn't see

2334
01:56:56,992 --> 01:56:58,144
is that their demise

2335
01:56:59,264 --> 01:57:00,190
is imminent.

2336
01:57:01,857 --> 01:57:06,148
And the most powerful weapon
in all galaxy?

2337
01:57:09,527 --> 01:57:10,426
Love.

2338
01:57:13,407 --> 01:57:18,720
Inside each and every
one of you is a spark, baby.

2339
01:57:19,573 --> 01:57:20,371
An ember.

2340
01:57:21,272 --> 01:57:23,637
A goddamn fire!

2341
01:57:27,451 --> 01:57:29,716
Love is how we will win.

2342
01:57:30,651 --> 01:57:32,538
And even if we lose,

2343
01:57:32,563 --> 01:57:36,369
we're gonna die
fighting for a happy...

2344
01:57:41,214 --> 01:57:43,840
Goddamn Jody, what in the crap am I saying.

2345
01:57:44,727 --> 01:57:46,527
- Cut, cut!
- Cutting that, please.

2346
01:57:46,552 --> 01:57:47,511
I mean...

2347
01:57:47,640 --> 01:57:49,027
Panties in a twist.

2348
01:57:49,193 --> 01:57:51,533
it is if someone took the last few pages,

2349
01:57:51,589 --> 01:57:54,543
wipe your ass but then said hmm, yeah sure,
give that a try. I mean...

2350
01:57:54,983 --> 01:57:55,927
What's the problem Tom?

2351
01:57:55,952 --> 01:57:57,560
- Do you not like the new pages?
- No.

2352
01:57:58,033 --> 01:58:01,224
Jody, you promised me real.
You promised me grit, art...

2353
01:58:01,249 --> 01:58:02,908
- I mean...
- Happy endings can be real.

2354
01:58:04,105 --> 01:58:04,945
I know.

2355
01:58:05,421 --> 01:58:06,098
I get it.

2356
01:58:06,123 --> 01:58:07,817
I see what you're trying to do

2357
01:58:09,425 --> 01:58:12,091
This Colt things hit
you pretty hard, okay?

2358
01:58:13,307 --> 01:58:14,551
It has me as well.

2359
01:58:14,695 --> 01:58:15,782
- You know.
- Yeah.

2360
01:58:17,341 --> 01:58:18,302
Look, he let us down.

2361
01:58:20,756 --> 01:58:21,639
Come here.

2362
01:58:24,669 --> 01:58:27,789
I think what you're having
is a little nervous breakdown.

2363
01:58:28,814 --> 01:58:29,328
Yeah.

2364
01:58:30,508 --> 01:58:31,548
Yeah, yeah.

2365
01:58:31,616 --> 01:58:32,503
And that's okay.

2366
01:58:32,716 --> 01:58:33,715
We all get one of those.

2367
01:58:33,762 --> 01:58:35,702
I have those quite frequently, actually.

2368
01:58:35,991 --> 01:58:37,486
Habitually, hoping you say.

2369
01:58:38,406 --> 01:58:40,426
I just, I feel pretty...

2370
01:58:41,751 --> 01:58:43,148
I feel pretty focused.

2371
01:58:43,175 --> 01:58:44,628
And I want you to know something.

2372
01:58:44,777 --> 01:58:45,523
I'm okay.

2373
01:58:46,457 --> 01:58:48,150
He was dead to me, anyway.

2374
01:58:52,543 --> 01:58:53,477
Do you know what I care about?

2375
01:58:55,643 --> 01:58:56,716
Not anymore.

2376
01:58:57,311 --> 01:58:58,471
Finishing this movie.

2377
01:58:59,252 --> 01:59:00,052
Our movie.

2378
01:59:03,289 --> 01:59:04,489
Makes me so....

2379
01:59:04,829 --> 01:59:06,656
happy to hear you say that because...

2380
01:59:06,737 --> 01:59:07,424
Our movie.

2381
01:59:08,221 --> 01:59:09,094
Our movie.

2382
01:59:09,661 --> 01:59:10,534
<i>Metalstorm.</i>

2383
01:59:10,927 --> 01:59:12,513
A Jody Morano film.

2384
01:59:12,680 --> 01:59:13,840
Starring Tom Ryder.

2385
01:59:15,703 --> 01:59:17,882
<i>Metalstorm,</i> baby, here we come.

2386
01:59:17,909 --> 01:59:19,881
We gonna put the <i>Metalstorm</i>

2387
01:59:19,955 --> 01:59:20,948
- to the past storm.
- Make me believe.

2388
01:59:21,175 --> 01:59:21,842
Okay?

2389
01:59:21,961 --> 01:59:22,514
Okay.

2390
01:59:22,539 --> 01:59:23,881
- You got this.
- Okay.

2391
01:59:24,025 --> 01:59:24,945
You got this.

2392
01:59:27,115 --> 01:59:28,955
- Make me believe, Tom Ryder.
- Give me some.

2393
01:59:29,046 --> 01:59:30,639
What do you want?
What do you want from this next one?

2394
01:59:30,907 --> 01:59:32,261
- What do you want.
- Dazzle me.

2395
01:59:32,354 --> 01:59:34,334
- Okay.
- Dazzle and surprise me.

2396
01:59:34,742 --> 01:59:35,789
Inspire me.

2397
01:59:36,439 --> 01:59:37,712
I just got my motivation.

2398
01:59:37,737 --> 01:59:38,636
Of course you did.

2399
01:59:38,683 --> 01:59:39,770
Right there, Jody.

2400
01:59:40,163 --> 01:59:40,777
Okay.

2401
01:59:40,812 --> 01:59:41,612
That is...

2402
01:59:41,998 --> 01:59:44,065
my trip out of here to
Saint Barris with Drake.

2403
01:59:45,426 --> 01:59:47,891
One take is all I need
and then I'm out of here.

2404
01:59:47,916 --> 01:59:48,599
I love it.

2405
01:59:48,660 --> 01:59:49,564
Sounds amazing.

2406
01:59:49,589 --> 01:59:50,657
- All right. Let's do it.
- Off we go, all right?

2407
01:59:50,682 --> 01:59:51,955
- One and done.
- Yep.

2408
01:59:51,984 --> 01:59:52,744
Let's do it.

2409
01:59:52,772 --> 01:59:53,845
- Let's... Let's go again!
- It's gonna be mad.

2410
01:59:54,019 --> 01:59:55,179
Resetting, please!

2411
01:59:55,204 --> 01:59:56,011
Oh, you again!

2412
01:59:56,744 --> 01:59:58,490
One take wonder, Jody.
You know it.

2413
01:59:58,544 --> 01:59:59,477
- Yeah.
- Very tense.

2414
01:59:59,502 --> 02:00:02,216
You know what, Gail?
It's the vibe on this set, okay?

2415
02:00:02,284 --> 02:00:04,717
You got bulletproof vested security.

2416
02:00:04,742 --> 02:00:05,662
Right. I know but, look,

2417
02:00:05,728 --> 02:00:06,602
think about it.

2418
02:00:06,628 --> 02:00:09,423
Everything that's happened is bit of
extra protection for all of us, okay?

2419
02:00:09,463 --> 02:00:10,330
Gotta be safe.

2420
02:00:10,729 --> 02:00:11,676
It just... if they can just

2421
02:00:11,822 --> 02:00:13,099
clear out of it, that would be...

2422
02:00:13,151 --> 02:00:13,993
- Yeah.
- Okay.

2423
02:00:14,116 --> 02:00:15,316
You heard her, back it up!

2424
02:00:15,357 --> 02:00:17,149
Guys, back it up.
Thank you.

2425
02:00:18,774 --> 02:00:19,734
Lock it up, guys.
Thank you.

2426
02:00:20,672 --> 02:00:22,038
The pumpkin heads goes to two.

2427
02:00:23,065 --> 02:00:23,805
Amazing.

2428
02:00:23,945 --> 02:00:25,452
- Where's she gonna...
- she's just, um...

2429
02:00:25,570 --> 02:00:26,757
I think she's...
we all got playback.

2430
02:00:27,101 --> 02:00:29,207
Listen, I got more
take out of him,

2431
02:00:29,554 --> 02:00:30,887
and then you need to be ready.

2432
02:00:30,948 --> 02:00:31,914
Okay?
It's game on.

2433
02:00:33,031 --> 02:00:35,218
174, Alpha, take two.

2434
02:00:38,598 --> 02:00:40,965
- And, action!
- Whoa, whoa, one second, one second.

2435
02:00:44,630 --> 02:00:45,310
Action!

2436
02:00:48,707 --> 02:00:50,813
It's high noon at the edge of
the universe, folks.

2437
02:00:51,730 --> 02:00:52,903
Zero notice here.

2438
02:00:53,017 --> 02:00:55,017
We're moving as fast
as we can, all right?

2439
02:00:55,907 --> 02:00:57,527
Light the pyro!

2440
02:00:59,192 --> 02:01:02,598
We need enough charges to blow
this canyon sky-high, people.

2441
02:01:03,553 --> 02:01:04,533
<i>McCabe, where are we?</i>

2442
02:01:05,011 --> 02:01:06,584
Going as fast as I can, Nige.

2443
02:01:06,659 --> 02:01:09,539
And even if we lose, we're gonna die

2444
02:01:10,128 --> 02:01:12,741
fighting for a happy ending!

2445
02:01:13,701 --> 02:01:15,515
Hell yeah!

2446
02:01:17,804 --> 02:01:19,251
Let's go get it, man!

2447
02:01:19,597 --> 02:01:22,410
Go on out there, here we go!

2448
02:01:22,774 --> 02:01:23,722
Who's with me?

2449
02:01:23,746 --> 02:01:25,060
Who is with me!

2450
02:01:25,085 --> 02:01:26,345
Cut!
Yes!

2451
02:01:27,566 --> 02:01:29,516
Soo good!
Soo good.

2452
02:01:29,636 --> 02:01:30,550
Thank you.

2453
02:01:30,582 --> 02:01:31,862
- Is that it?
- God, yeah.

2454
02:01:31,887 --> 02:01:33,017
- Did we get it?
- It was so good.

2455
02:01:33,042 --> 02:01:34,350
- We got it?
- Magic. Yeah, yeah.

2456
02:01:34,819 --> 02:01:35,779
Oh, my God.

2457
02:01:35,912 --> 02:01:37,045
- I really felt that one.
- Gail was in floods.

2458
02:01:37,074 --> 02:01:38,521
- I really felt that one.
- Of course you did.

2459
02:01:38,645 --> 02:01:39,518
'Cause I had tears.

2460
02:01:39,620 --> 02:01:40,817
Yeah, I know. I can see them.

2461
02:01:40,997 --> 02:01:41,938
Yeah, it was fantastic.

2462
02:01:42,688 --> 02:01:45,398
So, listen, all we have left
is the alien truck coverage.

2463
02:01:45,498 --> 02:01:46,658
- All right? That's it.
- No.

2464
02:01:46,818 --> 02:01:47,955
Yep. We're gonna do
the car jump.

2465
02:01:48,008 --> 02:01:48,395
No.

2466
02:01:48,588 --> 02:01:49,794
- No one told me about another setup.
- We said-- No.

2467
02:01:49,863 --> 02:01:51,143
- There's another setup?
- Venti's gonna do that in VFX,

2468
02:01:51,205 --> 02:01:52,423
- so we're out of here.
-I know, but we need his close-up.

2469
02:01:52,448 --> 02:01:54,365
 All right? I need his close-up
right here for the coverage.

2470
02:01:54,390 --> 02:01:56,126
All right? 15 minutes tops.
That's all I need.

2471
02:01:56,306 --> 02:01:57,183
This is the bit,
do you remember,

2472
02:01:57,208 --> 02:01:58,880
where Space Cowboy steals
the alien vehicle?

2473
02:01:59,375 --> 02:02:00,816
-Come on. This is his moment.

2474
02:02:00,841 --> 02:02:03,069
Wait, wait, wait.
I'm not gonna do any driving, right?

2475
02:02:03,094 --> 02:02:04,451
Because I'm gonna feel
really nauseous.

2476
02:02:04,757 --> 02:02:05,711
It's a blue screen setup.

2477
02:02:05,891 --> 02:02:07,679
I need this. I need this, okay?

2478
02:02:07,765 --> 02:02:10,669
Everyone, double the pace, yes?!

2479
02:02:10,694 --> 02:02:12,993
Use those muscles!

2480
02:02:17,644 --> 02:02:19,352
Everyone in position!

2481
02:02:19,409 --> 02:02:20,740
We're as ready as we can be.

2482
02:02:20,827 --> 02:02:21,973
Okay. Hey, get Ray to come in

2483
02:02:22,011 --> 02:02:23,811
- and check the mic before we go, okay?
- Copy.

2484
02:02:23,933 --> 02:02:26,248
Sound, can you come down here
and check Ryder's mic, please?

2485
02:02:31,986 --> 02:02:33,336
All right, Tom. You ready?

2486
02:02:33,606 --> 02:02:34,829
- Yeah.
- Okay. Remember this bit?

2487
02:02:34,854 --> 02:02:36,086
You're gonna be in
the alien vehicle.

2488
02:02:36,450 --> 02:02:37,624
- Okay? Okay.
- Yep.

2489
02:02:37,649 --> 02:02:38,551
And with nowhere to go,

2490
02:02:38,576 --> 02:02:39,979
you're gonna jump the car
over the ravine.

2491
02:02:40,004 --> 02:02:41,501
So I just need
a quick pop on you...

2492
02:02:41,526 --> 02:02:42,987
Space Cowboy
ain't scared of no ravine.

2493
02:02:43,012 --> 02:02:43,960
- Of course he's not.
- So I'm thinking maybe just

2494
02:02:43,985 --> 02:02:45,953
a couple of reaction shots
of me gritting my teeth.

2495
02:02:45,978 --> 02:02:47,821
Like, "Goddamn."
Something like that.

2496
02:02:48,048 --> 02:02:48,485
Stoic.

2497
02:02:48,579 --> 02:02:49,484
- Yeah, yeah. I like it.
- All right?

2498
02:02:49,509 --> 02:02:50,491
- What do you think?
- I like it. Okay.

2499
02:02:50,516 --> 02:02:52,486
I think it's gonna be great.
Yeah, I love the choice.

2500
02:02:52,876 --> 02:02:53,808
All right, let's pop these on.

2501
02:02:53,833 --> 02:02:54,886
- Okay. What's this?
- There you go.

2502
02:02:54,911 --> 02:02:56,172
No, this is because
you've escaped the aliens.

2503
02:02:56,197 --> 02:02:58,178
Is this necessary?
It's a bit much, no?

2504
02:02:58,382 --> 02:02:59,218
Raise the stakes.

2505
02:03:00,417 --> 02:03:01,096
It's kind of cool.

2506
02:03:01,121 --> 02:03:02,486
- Yeah. It's cool. Okay.
- Raise the stakes.

2507
02:03:02,511 --> 02:03:03,965
- Let's do it.
- 'Cause you know, Space Cowboy.

2508
02:03:03,990 --> 02:03:05,316
Nobody can get at
the Space Cowboy.

2509
02:03:05,341 --> 02:03:07,035
- No way. Even when he's cuffed.
- Excuse me. Tom, sorry.

2510
02:03:07,159 --> 02:03:09,082
Jesus, Ray. I told you
to do it before I got on set.

2511
02:03:09,197 --> 02:03:10,070
Appreciate you, Tom.

2512
02:03:10,928 --> 02:03:12,267
Thank you. Sound good.

2513
02:03:12,292 --> 02:03:13,107
- Okay.
- Okay, great.

2514
02:03:13,236 --> 02:03:13,887
- So...
- So...

2515
02:03:13,978 --> 02:03:15,353
You got this guy
coming on your left.

2516
02:03:15,402 --> 02:03:16,964
- Hey, bro.
- All right, take him out.

2517
02:03:17,004 --> 02:03:18,643
Someone else is gonna
crash down on the bonnet.

2518
02:03:18,671 --> 02:03:19,505
You're gonna take him out.

2519
02:03:19,563 --> 02:03:21,669
No, no, no. See, what I'm
thinking is maybe I come down,

2520
02:03:21,848 --> 02:03:24,753
I take him out first,
and I'm like "pow, pow, pow."

2521
02:03:24,843 --> 02:03:26,365
- I slide over and go "pow."
- Yeah. Yeah.

2522
02:03:26,591 --> 02:03:28,374
And then maybe I say
a little line like,

2523
02:03:28,642 --> 02:03:31,653
"I was shooting aliens
way before I was paid to."

2524
02:03:31,844 --> 02:03:33,208
Fantastic.
All right, let's lock it up.

2525
02:03:33,638 --> 02:03:35,370
- Let's shoot, Nigel.
- Standing by, please.

2526
02:03:35,934 --> 02:03:36,642
All right.

2527
02:03:36,701 --> 02:03:37,842
Take one. Marker.

2528
02:03:38,329 --> 02:03:41,174
In three, two, one, action.

2529
02:03:42,646 --> 02:03:44,219
Not your lucky day, alien.

2530
02:03:44,885 --> 02:03:46,006
You got to go.

2531
02:03:47,158 --> 02:03:48,516
You can't outrun me.

2532
02:03:48,656 --> 02:03:50,438
I'm Space Cowboy!

2533
02:03:52,117 --> 02:03:53,508
You are approaching the ravine.

2534
02:03:53,943 --> 02:03:55,008
There's nowhere else to go.

2535
02:03:55,067 --> 02:03:56,068
Turn right. Go on.

2536
02:03:56,866 --> 02:03:57,816
You have no choice.

2537
02:03:57,841 --> 02:03:58,816
You're gonna
have to make the jump.

2538
02:03:58,977 --> 02:04:01,619
In three, two, one.

2539
02:04:06,953 --> 02:04:08,301
Who is that in the car with him?

2540
02:04:08,627 --> 02:04:11,262
We're-we're in the middle
of a take right now, asshole.

2541
02:04:11,300 --> 02:04:12,669
What are you doing?

2542
02:04:13,143 --> 02:04:15,103
He's just buckling you in.
Safety first. That's it.

2543
02:04:15,128 --> 02:04:17,258
It's really tight.
Is this necessary?

2544
02:04:17,624 --> 02:04:19,838
Hey, we are filming right now.

2545
02:04:19,926 --> 02:04:21,144
Keep rolling, keep rolling.

2546
02:04:21,712 --> 02:04:23,083
Sell it, Tom. It looks amazing.

2547
02:04:23,108 --> 02:04:23,918
- Take a deep breath.
- It does not look--

2548
02:04:23,943 --> 02:04:25,070
Get out of the car.

2549
02:04:26,588 --> 02:04:27,173
Howdy.

2550
02:04:27,478 --> 02:04:29,447
No, no, wait. Stop. No.

2551
02:04:30,471 --> 02:04:31,536
Wait, what's happening?

2552
02:04:33,565 --> 02:04:34,680
Oh, my God!

2553
02:04:36,619 --> 02:04:38,083
Get to the cars!

2554
02:04:40,806 --> 02:04:42,408
Jody, what the hell
are you doing?!

2555
02:04:42,433 --> 02:04:43,741
I'm trying to get something
real out of him, Gail.

2556
02:04:43,766 --> 02:04:45,075
There's no cameras on him!

2557
02:04:48,020 --> 02:04:50,475
Hey, Dan? They're approaching
Ambush Alley right now.

2558
02:04:50,792 --> 02:04:51,655
We're ready.

2559
02:04:53,956 --> 02:04:55,976
Let me out right now!

2560
02:04:56,014 --> 02:04:59,083
What are you gonna do, huh?
You gonna kill me? Again?!

2561
02:05:03,890 --> 02:05:05,529
- Can you untie me?
- No.

2562
02:05:12,832 --> 02:05:13,585
McCabe!

2563
02:05:14,296 --> 02:05:18,174
Smoke screen in three, two, one!

2564
02:05:19,755 --> 02:05:21,691
This does not seem safe, man!

2565
02:05:27,991 --> 02:05:29,784
Dan, where are they?
Do you have eyes on them?

2566
02:05:30,189 --> 02:05:32,488
I see 'em.
Everything's going to plan.

2567
02:05:36,101 --> 02:05:37,087
I'll block the road.

2568
02:05:37,224 --> 02:05:38,825
They shall not pass!

2569
02:05:39,282 --> 02:05:41,493
I see them.
They're entering Ambush Alley.

2570
02:05:46,451 --> 02:05:48,154
I can't see shit!

2571
02:05:49,602 --> 02:05:51,310
McCabe, one!

2572
02:05:53,353 --> 02:05:54,772
McCabe, two!

2573
02:05:58,559 --> 02:06:00,142
McCabe! Now!

2574
02:06:10,528 --> 02:06:11,824
I love my job.

2575
02:06:16,001 --> 02:06:19,421
Whoa, mama!

2576
02:06:19,892 --> 02:06:22,286
Oh, goddamn!

2577
02:06:22,445 --> 02:06:24,975
I can't think straight when
you drive like this.

2578
02:06:25,000 --> 02:06:26,507
You're supposed to be dead.

2579
02:06:26,762 --> 02:06:29,831
You blew up
in-in a thousand pieces.

2580
02:06:29,856 --> 02:06:30,679
You went kaboom.

2581
02:06:30,704 --> 02:06:33,057
Maybe you confusing me with someone
else you murdered?

2582
02:06:33,097 --> 02:06:35,064
Like, Henry or Doone or

2583
02:06:35,192 --> 02:06:35,912
Kevin?!

2584
02:06:35,950 --> 02:06:37,886
I like Kevin, okay?

2585
02:06:37,913 --> 02:06:39,760
- Like him or not, you murdered him!
- I was roleplaying!

2586
02:06:39,794 --> 02:06:41,148
I was playing a character.

2587
02:06:41,173 --> 02:06:43,701
Playing freaking Tommy

2588
02:06:44,076 --> 02:06:45,073
I said a few things,

2589
02:06:45,121 --> 02:06:46,267
i ordered their death,

2590
02:06:46,300 --> 02:06:47,960
I didn't think they gonna kill them.

2591
02:06:48,221 --> 02:06:49,605
- Okay.
- Okay?

2592
02:06:49,686 --> 02:06:52,125
I can’t help it if no one
can't tell the difference

2593
02:06:52,206 --> 02:06:53,238
when I'm acting,

2594
02:06:53,279 --> 02:06:55,405
and I'm being so goddamn natural.

2595
02:06:56,122 --> 02:06:57,655
- I was there, Tom Ryder.
- What's your problem?

2596
02:06:57,693 --> 02:06:59,113
Some might say i was an eyewitness,

2597
02:06:59,138 --> 02:07:00,365
- And how did I do?
- Tom Ryder.

2598
02:07:00,390 --> 02:07:02,652
- How good was that performance?
- You ordered their death.

2599
02:07:03,422 --> 02:07:03,868
Right.

2600
02:07:03,922 --> 02:07:05,222
It was very convincing,

2601
02:07:05,424 --> 02:07:06,311
Tom Ryder.

2602
02:07:06,785 --> 02:07:08,773
Why are you saying my name
like that?

2603
02:07:08,798 --> 02:07:10,806
- That is your name, isn't it, Tom Ryder?
- Yes, yes.

2604
02:07:10,913 --> 02:07:12,403
A blind man could see
that you're

2605
02:07:12,476 --> 02:07:13,717
- Tom Ryder.
- You're saying that like...

2606
02:07:13,844 --> 02:07:15,317
- "Tom Ryder, Tom Ryder."
- Okay. That's me.

2607
02:07:15,398 --> 02:07:17,272
- You're saying it like some obsessed fangirl.
- That's me, Colt Seavers, saying that.

2608
02:07:17,432 --> 02:07:19,191
Roll the cameras.
We're heading for the jump.

2609
02:07:19,552 --> 02:07:21,145
<i>Tom Ryder's
doing his own stunts!</i>

2610
02:07:21,170 --> 02:07:22,722
Everyone, roll. Arm car?

2611
02:07:23,775 --> 02:07:24,148
Check.

2612
02:07:24,181 --> 02:07:25,275
- Heli.
-Check.

2613
02:07:25,441 --> 02:07:26,722
I'm done taking the falls
for you.

2614
02:07:26,747 --> 02:07:27,896
You're gonna do your own stunts
from now on.

2615
02:07:27,921 --> 02:07:29,178
I don't want to do my own

2616
02:07:29,203 --> 02:07:30,029
- stunts, Colt!
- Relax.

2617
02:07:30,171 --> 02:07:32,450
It's just a 250-foot jump
that'll probably kill us.

2618
02:07:32,656 --> 02:07:34,538
It's never been done before.
It's for Comic-Con.

2619
02:07:34,780 --> 02:07:37,822
- It's Hall H. It's a big deal.
- What are you doing, man?

2620
02:07:37,895 --> 02:07:39,035
I thought it'd be fitting.

2621
02:07:39,120 --> 02:07:41,463
Me and you, Tom Ryder,
one last stunt.

2622
02:07:41,861 --> 02:07:43,356
You know,
like Thelma and Louise.

2623
02:07:43,690 --> 02:07:45,549
- Thelma and Louise?
- Yeah.

2624
02:07:45,675 --> 02:07:47,990
- They die at the end.
- Exactly!

2625
02:07:48,404 --> 02:07:49,627
Murder-suicide.

2626
02:07:49,762 --> 02:07:51,731
Can you just pull over
and let me out right now?

2627
02:07:53,655 --> 02:07:55,588
You're not getting
out of this car until you,

2628
02:07:55,688 --> 02:07:58,233
Tom Ryder, tell me,
Colt Seavers, the truth!

2629
02:07:58,258 --> 02:07:59,385
All right, all right,
all right, all right!

2630
02:07:59,512 --> 02:08:00,420
It was all Gail.

2631
02:08:00,445 --> 02:08:02,652
When I killed Henry,
she wanted to cover it up

2632
02:08:02,712 --> 02:08:03,919
because, to be honest,

2633
02:08:04,139 --> 02:08:06,736
Space Cowboy's one of
my best roles yet, Colt,

2634
02:08:06,789 --> 02:08:08,355
and I don't want
this movie to fail.

2635
02:08:08,549 --> 02:08:09,980
So you're saying that Gail Meyer

2636
02:08:09,980 --> 02:08:12,803
was responsible for framing me
for your murder of Henry?

2637
02:08:13,049 --> 02:08:14,825
Yes! Yes!

2638
02:08:15,111 --> 02:08:16,384
But what's your real name?

2639
02:08:16,909 --> 02:08:18,044
Tom Ryder.

2640
02:08:19,572 --> 02:08:20,725
Did you get that, Jody?

2641
02:08:20,985 --> 02:08:23,011
We got it! He confessed.

2642
02:08:23,353 --> 02:08:25,372
<i>You wearing a wire?
Bro, you recording this?</i>

2643
02:08:25,466 --> 02:08:26,876
This is entrapment.
You can't do that.

2644
02:08:26,901 --> 02:08:28,271
- What are you doing?
- No, it's not entrapment,

2645
02:08:28,296 --> 02:08:30,455
because you're wearing
the wire, dipshit!

2646
02:08:34,873 --> 02:08:36,204
He's going for it. Go. Go now.

2647
02:08:36,204 --> 02:08:38,193
I'm just an actor!

2648
02:08:38,727 --> 02:08:39,176
Wait.

2649
02:08:39,830 --> 02:08:40,846
He has a mouth guard.

2650
02:08:41,132 --> 02:08:42,419
I don't have a mouth guard.

2651
02:09:31,261 --> 02:09:32,919
- Oh, good.
- <i>Colt!</i>

2652
02:09:33,228 --> 02:09:34,399
- You're alive.
- <i>Are you okay?</i>

2653
02:09:36,893 --> 02:09:37,778
Are you okay?

2654
02:09:37,860 --> 02:09:40,023
<i>I told you
I'd make the camera up to you.</i>

2655
02:09:40,268 --> 02:09:41,854
Oh, it was fantastic.

2656
02:09:42,072 --> 02:09:43,340
<i>Dressler, come in! -Ah!</i>

2657
02:09:43,365 --> 02:09:45,855
Oy, can you hear me?
We've got to get out of here!

2658
02:09:46,373 --> 02:09:47,875
<i>This is all Gail's fault, man.</i>

2659
02:09:48,021 --> 02:09:49,085
<i>This is all Gail's idea.</i>

2660
02:09:49,310 --> 02:09:50,638
- Give me that confession!
- No.

2661
02:09:50,831 --> 02:09:52,378
Give me all the media!
Are you deaf?!

2662
02:09:52,958 --> 02:09:55,384
<i>Dressler, bring
the helicopter to the trench.</i>

2663
02:09:55,558 --> 02:09:56,757
- What about Ryder?
- <i>Now!</i>

2664
02:09:57,014 --> 02:09:58,385
Now, about this date.

2665
02:09:58,481 --> 02:10:00,526
Put it in the case, you numpty!

2666
02:10:00,959 --> 02:10:02,028
Can we call it a date?

2667
02:10:02,195 --> 02:10:02,761
I mean,

2668
02:10:03,314 --> 02:10:04,708
that's what it is, right?

2669
02:10:05,452 --> 02:10:06,467
Such a moron!

2670
02:10:07,420 --> 02:10:09,073
- Hurry up! God!
- Take it.

2671
02:10:10,330 --> 02:10:11,254
Gail, Gail, Gail.

2672
02:10:12,314 --> 02:10:14,291
- Listen...
- Give me the recording, Gail.

2673
02:10:14,316 --> 02:10:17,239
Darling, calm down.
Just come with me.

2674
02:10:17,264 --> 02:10:19,756
We don't need
all this toxic masculinity,

2675
02:10:19,781 --> 02:10:21,369
because we're the same,
you and me.

2676
02:10:21,394 --> 02:10:22,700
You know, we're survivors.

2677
02:10:22,915 --> 02:10:24,653
No, no, no, no.
I'm nothing like you.

2678
02:10:24,786 --> 02:10:26,861
<i>I don't want to be
presumptuous, I mean,</i>

2679
02:10:27,645 --> 02:10:29,456
but let's call a spade a spade.

2680
02:10:29,823 --> 02:10:31,660
That's why I gave you the job.

2681
02:10:31,821 --> 02:10:33,044
- Okay.
- Well, that and because

2682
02:10:33,156 --> 02:10:36,147
you're so easily mouldable,
you know?

2683
02:10:36,855 --> 02:10:38,475
We put up with worse than this.

2684
02:10:38,632 --> 02:10:40,265
We've survived more than Ryder

2685
02:10:40,356 --> 02:10:41,256
I mean, you know what?

2686
02:10:41,667 --> 02:10:43,853
My mom's version of
a good night kiss...

2687
02:10:45,897 --> 02:10:47,180
- Oh!
- Gail, just give me the case!

2688
02:10:47,205 --> 02:10:49,075
This is a Gail Meyer production!

2689
02:10:49,333 --> 02:10:50,346
Not yours!

2690
02:10:50,834 --> 02:10:52,212
Rendezvous with the boss
in the canyon.

2691
02:10:52,888 --> 02:10:53,941
Extraction to the spaceship set.

2692
02:10:54,243 --> 02:10:55,438
Spaceship set?

2693
02:10:56,371 --> 02:10:58,193
Oh, no, Big Red.

2694
02:10:58,525 --> 02:11:00,424
I don't think
you're gonna make that one.

2695
02:11:00,520 --> 02:11:02,759
- Stunts set!
- Stunts set!

2696
02:11:02,833 --> 02:11:03,831
Go!

2697
02:11:17,871 --> 02:11:20,111
Trust me, I will not
be taking the fall for this,

2698
02:11:20,503 --> 02:11:25,069
because I deliver hits
for all you little people.

2699
02:11:25,561 --> 02:11:26,444
You're welcome.

2700
02:11:29,469 --> 02:11:30,319
Jody?

2701
02:11:33,777 --> 02:11:34,512
Jody?

2702
02:11:34,785 --> 02:11:36,781
That's for me! That's for me!

2703
02:11:36,875 --> 02:11:38,134
That's my helicopter!

2704
02:11:38,180 --> 02:11:40,555
This crazy stuntman's
lost his mind!

2705
02:11:54,513 --> 02:11:56,189
I'm on vacation!

2706
02:12:09,361 --> 02:12:10,494
Get this dog off me!

2707
02:12:10,861 --> 02:12:11,621
Not again, dog.

2708
02:12:12,967 --> 02:12:14,164
Just stay there!

2709
02:12:15,172 --> 02:12:17,614
Night-night, dog! You're dead.

2710
02:12:29,754 --> 02:12:31,481
This design is growing on me.

2711
02:12:32,970 --> 02:12:35,785
Get in! Let's get out of here!

2712
02:12:36,257 --> 02:12:37,877
Yeah, copy that.
Taking off now.

2713
02:12:37,925 --> 02:12:39,794
Drake said no plus 1.

2714
02:12:39,819 --> 02:12:41,612
Look, they know everything!

2715
02:12:42,682 --> 02:12:44,110
Wait, what-what is this?

2716
02:12:44,266 --> 02:12:45,208
It's the evidence!

2717
02:12:45,251 --> 02:12:47,088
Why didn't you just
stop talking?!

2718
02:12:47,828 --> 02:12:48,654
Jody!

2719
02:12:48,867 --> 02:12:50,787
Blow the pyros. Blow the pyros!

2720
02:12:50,787 --> 02:12:51,862
They're getting away!

2721
02:12:56,625 --> 02:12:58,219
Holy shit!

2722
02:12:58,704 --> 02:13:00,532
- Lower the arm! I'm gonna jump.
- Okay.

2723
02:13:00,956 --> 02:13:02,330
Okay, lower the arm.
Lower the arm.

2724
02:13:07,433 --> 02:13:08,386
I have a plan!

2725
02:13:08,871 --> 02:13:10,603
What is it?
What's-what's the plan?

2726
02:13:10,680 --> 02:13:11,848
Get me to the helicopter.

2727
02:13:11,873 --> 02:13:13,101
I'm gonna jump onto the skids,

2728
02:13:13,126 --> 02:13:14,160
and then I'm gonna
beat the shit out of him.

2729
02:13:14,255 --> 02:13:15,843
No, just-just get the recording.

2730
02:13:30,100 --> 02:13:31,013
Go!

2731
02:13:32,086 --> 02:13:32,855
Ah, shit.

2732
02:13:33,213 --> 02:13:34,476
Go!

2733
02:13:36,992 --> 02:13:37,729
Get me down!

2734
02:13:38,322 --> 02:13:39,188
Get me down!

2735
02:13:39,605 --> 02:13:40,955
We're losing hydraulics here.

2736
02:13:41,056 --> 02:13:42,321
I can't get it under control.

2737
02:13:43,367 --> 02:13:45,342
Just wondering,
you know, after this movie,

2738
02:13:45,367 --> 02:13:47,868
and if I don't go to prison
and, you know, you're not busy,

2739
02:13:47,893 --> 02:13:49,565
maybe we could go
to a beach somewhere.

2740
02:13:50,256 --> 02:13:52,079
Wear a couple of
swimming costumes.

2741
02:13:52,079 --> 02:13:54,257
Just drink a spicy margarita
or something.

2742
02:13:54,602 --> 02:13:56,394
Make some bad decisions.

2743
02:13:56,419 --> 02:13:57,274
Okay, sure. Yes.

2744
02:13:57,545 --> 02:13:59,747
- Sound like a plan?
- It's a better plan than this.

2745
02:13:59,860 --> 02:14:00,926
Okay, please be careful.

2746
02:14:01,810 --> 02:14:03,449
Okay, swing him around. Go!

2747
02:14:21,101 --> 02:14:22,945
God, get it under control!

2748
02:14:23,336 --> 02:14:25,145
Get us out of here!
What are you doing?!

2749
02:14:31,767 --> 02:14:32,953
Ryder, the confession!

2750
02:14:33,054 --> 02:14:33,693
No!

2751
02:14:34,169 --> 02:14:36,171
- No! No, Gail, no!

Shoot him!
He's a stupid stuntman!

2772

No one gives a shit!

2773

He's one of the best
stunt doubles I've ever had!
