1
00:02:25,583 --> 00:02:26,625
Wait, wait.

2
00:02:39,041 --> 00:02:42,875
We've got at least 16 guards
on site, four vehicles primed.

3
00:02:43,916 --> 00:02:45,916
Konrad's moving guns.

4
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,041
Lots of them.

5
00:02:47,125 --> 00:02:48,750
He's a real piece of work.

6
00:02:48,833 --> 00:02:51,958
He's up to his ears in scanners
and other jamming technology,

7
00:02:52,041 --> 00:02:54,333
so we're gonna lose comms
the moment we're inside.

8
00:02:54,416 --> 00:02:56,916
Question. Do we ever
get any days off?

9
00:02:57,583 --> 00:03:00,583
-You're such a millennial, Nile.
-Hey, it's a fair question.

10
00:03:00,666 --> 00:03:03,416
Nile, we didn't
have any days off

11
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:04,958
when we were the new ones.

12
00:03:05,041 --> 00:03:06,875
All right, Joe, Nicky,

13
00:03:06,958 --> 00:03:08,541
you guys take the hedge maze.

14
00:03:10,333 --> 00:03:11,333
What?

15
00:03:11,416 --> 00:03:12,666
Really?

16
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:14,000
Don't worry.

17
00:03:14,083 --> 00:03:17,583
-It's not going to be like 1853.
-What are you guys talking about?

18
00:03:17,666 --> 00:03:19,208
There was a cannon.

19
00:03:19,291 --> 00:03:20,666
We didn't see it.

20
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:22,416
It was Booker.

21
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:28,458
His head was blown clean off by a
cannon. We couldn't find it in the maze.

22
00:03:28,541 --> 00:03:30,666
And he couldn't help,
for obvious reasons.

23
00:03:32,666 --> 00:03:34,041
You think he's okay?

24
00:03:41,541 --> 00:03:42,791
Let's do this, guys.

25
00:03:44,041 --> 00:03:45,958
Let us know if you
put eyes on Konrad.

26
00:03:46,041 --> 00:03:48,000
Two guards have moved
to the waterfront.

27
00:03:48,083 --> 00:03:49,750
No sign of the big man yet.

28
00:03:53,541 --> 00:03:54,625
Hey.

29
00:04:03,125 --> 00:04:05,750
-He's only got one weapon.
-You sure?

30
00:04:06,333 --> 00:04:08,666
Do I need to remind you
you're not immortal?

31
00:04:10,166 --> 00:04:11,166
Fair enough.

32
00:04:38,833 --> 00:04:41,208
All right, guys.
You know what to do.

33
00:04:41,791 --> 00:04:43,875
Get as many guards to
chase you as you can.

You must have seen some bad
art in your time, haven't you?

49
00:06:05,541 --> 00:06:08,291
This bad? Not in
at least a century.

50
00:06:10,208 --> 00:06:11,708
Weapons being loaded.

51
00:06:13,416 --> 00:06:16,166
They're on the move.
Commotion must've spooked 'em.

52
00:06:48,416 --> 00:06:50,336
I need to remind you,
you're not immortal either.

53
00:06:52,208 --> 00:06:54,625
-Shall I?
-Nope. I always go first.

00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:24,166
Nicky.

55
00:07:24,250 --> 00:07:26,291
Slow down, Joe! Slow down!

56
00:07:41,666 --> 00:07:43,500
Let's give these guys a run.

57
00:08:00,625 --> 00:08:02,041
Ah shit!

58
00:08:38,125 --> 00:08:39,125
Fuck!

59
00:09:30,708 --> 00:09:32,333
Konrad's upstairs.

60
00:09:46,833 --> 00:09:48,208
Get in! Get in! Get in!

61
00:10:01,041 --> 00:10:02,125
Nicolò.

62
00:10:22,625 --> 00:10:24,208
-You okay?
-Yeah.

63
00:10:57,958 --> 00:11:00,500
-Move.
-Stay on my six.

64
00:11:06,166 --> 00:11:07,958
Sixteen guards, huh?

65
00:11:08,041 --> 00:11:10,625
Go easy. CIA never
taught him how to count.

66
00:11:10,708 --> 00:11:13,000
Can we just, you know, do this?

67
00:12:00,333 --> 00:12:01,333
Looks good on you.

68
00:12:20,375 --> 00:12:21,625
We're all set.

69
00:12:21,708 --> 00:12:24,458
My CIA contact will be
here in seven minutes.

70
00:12:25,250 --> 00:12:27,458
He'll make sure the
weapons are collected.

71
00:12:27,541 --> 00:12:29,541

You gonna call it?

78
00:12:49,541 --> 00:12:51,458
-I'm thinking.
-She has tells.

79
00:12:52,041 --> 00:12:53,916
Took me centuries to
learn them. She has tells.

80
00:12:56,291 --> 00:12:58,958
-No one can read Andy.
-No, I think I can.

81
00:12:59,041 --> 00:13:00,708
Yeah.

82
00:13:00,791 --> 00:13:02,208
-Yeah?
-Oh yeah.

83
00:13:04,333 --> 00:13:05,416
She's telling the truth.

84
00:13:06,583 --> 00:13:09,250
-Last two rounds.
-Her left eye twitched last two rounds.

85
00:13:10,541 --> 00:13:12,000
The left eye.

86
00:13:12,083 --> 00:13:13,125
What?

87
00:13:13,833 --> 00:13:15,625
-Bullshit.
-You sure?

88
00:13:16,958 --> 00:13:18,208
Bullshit.

89
00:13:24,583 --> 00:13:26,125
Thank you.

90
00:13:28,250 --> 00:13:30,375
You know the worst part
about being mortal?

91
00:13:31,708 --> 00:13:33,541
Just the fucking hangovers.

92
00:13:35,208 --> 00:13:38,041
Too brutal, man. I don't know.

93
00:13:38,125 --> 00:13:40,166
-What the...
-I don't know how you do it.

94
00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:42,250
Be right back.

95
00:13:42,958 --> 00:13:45,458
Whoo! The drinking is fun.

96
00:13:45,541 --> 00:13:47,416
-Who you texting?
-It's my new boyfriend.

97
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:48,625
Come on. Let's go to bed.

98
00:13:51,041 --> 00:13:53,583
Sure, have another glass.

99
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:55,958
You'll snore all
night like a boar.

100
00:13:56,041 --> 00:13:57,166
Wow.

101
00:13:57,250 --> 00:13:59,833
You sleep talk all night.

102
00:13:59,916 --> 00:14:01,958
-Ciao.
-Good night.

103
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,541
You did real good today.

104
00:14:06,625 --> 00:14:09,208
Even though I drove a boat
halfway into the villa?

105
00:14:09,291 --> 00:14:12,250
Hey, listen, sometimes
quick is better than subtle.

106
00:14:12,333 --> 00:14:14,291
Oh! Today's lesson?

107
00:14:14,791 --> 00:14:16,708
Yes, it is.

108
00:14:22,625 --> 00:14:24,458
You know, you joke a lot, but…

109
00:14:25,875 --> 00:14:26,916
How are you doing?

110
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Me?

111
00:14:30,625 --> 00:14:32,125
I'm really happy.

112
00:14:36,541 --> 00:14:37,666
I'm at peace.

113
00:14:40,458 --> 00:14:43,166
Didn't look peaceful when you were
throwing that guy out the window.

114
00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:44,833
It wasn't supposed to be.

115
00:14:45,875 --> 00:14:46,958
Send it now.

116
00:14:47,458 --> 00:14:50,416
I mean, I'm mortal.
I'm not retired.

117
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:53,541
My contact confirmed that
Konrad wasn't the buyer.

118
00:14:54,041 --> 00:14:56,958
Just a conduit, like
the others last month.

119
00:14:57,041 --> 00:14:59,916
So who is? And what are they
doing with all that artillery?

120
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,916
The real buyer is elusive.
Leaves almost no trace.

121
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:06,458
This CCTV photo is all
they're able to get me.

122
00:15:07,208 --> 00:15:08,208
Hey.

123
00:15:10,958 --> 00:15:11,958
What?

124
00:15:14,666 --> 00:15:16,458
-You know this woman?
-Yeah.

125
00:15:19,250 --> 00:15:21,666
I mean no. No, I…

126
00:15:22,833 --> 00:15:24,666
I think I recognize her.

127
00:15:25,875 --> 00:15:27,666
I've dreamt about her.

128
00:15:28,333 --> 00:15:31,166
I didn't think it meant
anything. It wasn't clear.

129
00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:34,750
Okay, just… tell me
exactly what you saw.

130
00:15:36,041 --> 00:15:37,375
This woman.

131
00:15:38,625 --> 00:15:39,958
She's, um…

132
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:41,875
She's in a room,

133
00:15:41,958 --> 00:15:44,791
an ancient room,
surrounded by books.

134
00:15:44,875 --> 00:15:46,916
She's here, isn't she?

135
00:15:51,625 --> 00:15:53,750
And there's someone
else there. A…

136
00:15:54,458 --> 00:15:55,583
A man, but…

137
00:15:57,416 --> 00:15:59,208
…I can't see his face.

138
00:16:01,625 --> 00:16:04,500
But the books, I
think they're his.

139
00:16:07,166 --> 00:16:09,541
None of you had a choice.

140
00:16:12,958 --> 00:16:14,875
She's hurting him.

141
00:16:17,250 --> 00:16:18,250
And then…

142
00:16:21,208 --> 00:16:22,291
And then what?

143
00:16:22,958 --> 00:16:24,458
And then I wake up.

144
00:16:27,708 --> 00:16:29,333
Think it means something?

145
00:16:30,208 --> 00:16:31,208
I don't know.

146
00:16:32,916 --> 00:16:35,541
There's not enough data yet
to get facial recognition,

147
00:16:35,625 --> 00:16:38,125
but the moment they
do, I'll let you know.

148
00:16:38,208 --> 00:16:40,083
Great. Thanks, Copley.

149
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,458
Hey. Don't worry
about this, okay?

150
00:16:48,541 --> 00:16:49,750
We'll figure it out.

151
00:17:13,750 --> 00:17:14,833
Booker.

152
00:17:17,375 --> 00:17:19,500
It's nice to finally meet you.

153
00:17:28,791 --> 00:17:32,958
I've been waiting
for a very long time.

154
00:17:34,958 --> 00:17:35,958
Quynh?

155
00:17:41,458 --> 00:17:42,458
So…

156
00:17:44,625 --> 00:17:46,875
How do I find Andromache?

157
00:18:14,625 --> 00:18:17,458
So, do you have any
idea where we can go?

158
00:18:18,083 --> 00:18:20,250
I was thinking of
having some time alone.

159
00:18:21,291 --> 00:18:22,291
Huh.

160
00:18:23,041 --> 00:18:24,833
Just a little time for myself.

161
00:18:26,333 --> 00:18:27,458
Okay.

162
00:18:27,541 --> 00:18:28,541
Thanks.

163
00:18:33,041 --> 00:18:34,458
You're coming with me.

164
00:18:35,291 --> 00:18:36,250
I am?

165
00:18:36,333 --> 00:18:37,666
I need your help.

166
00:18:41,208 --> 00:18:43,000
Try and have some
fun without me.

167
00:18:43,083 --> 00:18:44,708
Bye, boss.

168
00:18:45,291 --> 00:18:46,291
Nile.

169
00:18:51,583 --> 00:18:52,833
Don't worry, okay?

170
00:18:54,166 --> 00:18:55,500
Enjoy yourself.

171
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,791
What's up with Joe? Did
something happen after the wreck?

172
00:19:14,875 --> 00:19:17,166
He said he wanted
some time alone.

173
00:19:19,375 --> 00:19:20,916
You're not okay with that?

174
00:19:23,833 --> 00:19:25,666
I know this man
a thousand years.

175
00:19:26,875 --> 00:19:27,916
I know when he's lying.

176
00:19:34,958 --> 00:19:36,458
-Thank you.
-We're following him.

177
00:19:37,375 --> 00:19:38,375
What?

178
00:19:40,625 --> 00:19:41,625
Come on.

179
00:20:00,041 --> 00:20:03,875
Again, do you know
where Andromache is?

180
00:20:05,583 --> 00:20:07,333
It doesn't matter if I do.

181
00:20:07,833 --> 00:20:09,291
I'm in exile.

182
00:20:10,166 --> 00:20:12,833
-But you can find her.
-Are you listening to what I say?

183
00:20:15,125 --> 00:20:16,750
I'm exiled.

184
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:19,750
How'd you find me?

185
00:20:21,833 --> 00:20:23,125
You made it easy.

186
00:20:23,750 --> 00:20:26,500
Staggering around
Paris drunk for months.

187
00:20:28,166 --> 00:20:30,416
It's a miracle you
weren't discovered.

188
00:20:32,791 --> 00:20:34,958
So you bringing me here is…

189
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,625
Is you doing me a favor, right?

190
00:20:38,875 --> 00:20:40,250
Yeah.

191
00:20:40,750 --> 00:20:42,958
I'm sorry. I'm
telling you the truth.

192
00:20:43,458 --> 00:20:44,583
I'm out of it.

193
00:20:45,083 --> 00:20:47,583
You wanna know where Andy is?
This is not the way to do it.

194
00:20:55,375 --> 00:20:56,458
He will need clean clothes.

195
00:21:13,041 --> 00:21:14,625
Has she spoken of me?

196
00:21:20,291 --> 00:21:21,625
She never stopped.

197
00:21:26,833 --> 00:21:28,541
All that time,

198
00:21:29,166 --> 00:21:31,500
with every last breath I took,

199
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:35,166
I imagined she was
trapped somewhere

200
00:21:35,250 --> 00:21:36,916
in the same hell as me.

201
00:21:38,875 --> 00:21:40,541
All I wanted

202
00:21:42,250 --> 00:21:45,458
was to get out and
release her from it.

203
00:21:48,541 --> 00:21:50,333
Just to find out

204
00:21:50,416 --> 00:21:53,416
she'd been free for 500 years.

205
00:21:59,166 --> 00:22:01,833
She was living in
her own kind of hell.

206
00:22:02,833 --> 00:22:05,000
Now, that's hard to believe.

207
00:22:22,208 --> 00:22:23,208
Merci.

208
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,583
Not much of an exile

209
00:22:33,666 --> 00:22:35,958
if you're dropping in
to deliver groceries.

210
00:22:42,958 --> 00:22:44,125
Booker's alone.

211
00:22:45,666 --> 00:22:47,125
Nicky, caro, what…

212
00:22:47,666 --> 00:22:49,125
-He's alone.
-Yeah.

213
00:22:49,208 --> 00:22:51,041
And you were the one
screaming for his head.

214
00:22:51,125 --> 00:22:52,291
We abandoned him.

215
00:22:52,375 --> 00:22:53,833
He made his choice, Joe,

216
00:22:53,916 --> 00:22:56,458
when he shot Andy and
betrayed all of us.

217
00:22:56,541 --> 00:22:58,958
Guys, something's
happened. He's not here.

218
00:22:59,541 --> 00:23:01,458
There's blood on the
wall, blood on the floors.

219
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:04,458
When is the last time
you talked to him?

220
00:23:05,666 --> 00:23:08,166
-Joe.
-No reason in pretending now, Joe.

221
00:23:08,250 --> 00:23:09,875
I don't know. A
week… a week ago.

222
00:23:09,958 --> 00:23:12,250
He was fine… I don't...

223
00:23:12,333 --> 00:23:14,750
We gotta tell Andy, but it
keeps going to voicemail.

224
00:23:15,333 --> 00:23:17,250
Come on. We'll
meet them at Echo.

225
00:23:19,083 --> 00:23:20,958
-Nicky. Nicky!
-Come on. Come on.

226
00:23:28,250 --> 00:23:31,375
All this way, and you still haven't
told me who it is we're meeting.

227
00:23:32,791 --> 00:23:36,833
I made a promise the last time I saw
him that I would protect his secret.

228
00:23:38,458 --> 00:23:40,458
It's just around
this corner here.

229
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:44,583
Actually, I think maybe I should
just check in with him first.

230
00:23:44,666 --> 00:23:46,208
-Yeah.
-See if this is okay.

231
00:23:46,291 --> 00:23:48,208
Of course. I'll be on call.

232
00:23:48,750 --> 00:23:49,750
Okay.

233
00:24:25,375 --> 00:24:27,541
Andromache.

234
00:24:30,041 --> 00:24:31,041
You were expecting me?

235
00:24:32,708 --> 00:24:34,583
Let's just say
I'm not surprised.

236
00:24:47,708 --> 00:24:48,791
Thank you.

237
00:24:58,833 --> 00:25:01,083
You're still wearing
Quynh's necklace.

238
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:10,041
Do you still dream
about everyone?

239
00:25:11,916 --> 00:25:12,916
I keep tabs.

240
00:25:13,375 --> 00:25:16,208
-Do you know about Nile?
-Nile Freeman.

241
00:25:17,166 --> 00:25:18,125
I do.

242
00:25:18,208 --> 00:25:20,041
Well, she's been
dreaming about a woman.

243
00:25:21,291 --> 00:25:23,583
A woman who was here with you.

244
00:25:24,083 --> 00:25:26,333
I thought maybe
you'd know something.

245
00:25:29,416 --> 00:25:31,166
Why don't you come
to the library?

246
00:25:33,583 --> 00:25:35,041
I think we should talk.

247
00:25:36,083 --> 00:25:37,500
So do I.

248
00:25:40,958 --> 00:25:45,250
You know, Tuah, I almost completely
stopped believing in our purpose

249
00:25:46,083 --> 00:25:48,958
until a friend of mine
discovered a ripple effect.

250
00:25:50,625 --> 00:25:51,833
Where's this friend?

251
00:25:53,166 --> 00:25:54,500
So, uh,

252
00:25:54,583 --> 00:25:55,916
how old are you, then?

253
00:25:57,416 --> 00:26:00,708
Let's just say 2,300
for a round number.

254
00:26:01,708 --> 00:26:02,708
You?

255
00:26:03,166 --> 00:26:04,250
I'm 43.

256
00:26:05,666 --> 00:26:06,666
Impressive.

257
00:26:28,125 --> 00:26:29,208
Uh…

258
00:26:34,250 --> 00:26:35,291
This is…

259
00:26:37,375 --> 00:26:39,916
All about immortals?

260
00:26:40,833 --> 00:26:43,791
Yes, our place in history.

261
00:26:43,875 --> 00:26:46,041
The facts and fictions
that have found their way

262
00:26:46,125 --> 00:26:48,083
into the writings of cultures

263
00:26:48,583 --> 00:26:52,125
and civilizations…
the world over.

264
00:26:52,958 --> 00:26:55,208
Evidence of what you found out

265
00:26:55,291 --> 00:26:57,125
within 43 short years.

266
00:26:57,208 --> 00:26:58,625
Cause and effect.

267
00:26:59,125 --> 00:27:00,333
A life saved in Ghana…

268
00:27:01,125 --> 00:27:05,083
Leads to a Nobel Prize in
medicine three generations later.

269
00:27:06,375 --> 00:27:07,750
What happened over there?

270
00:27:09,916 --> 00:27:12,625
Those volumes were
stolen by one of us.

271
00:27:16,916 --> 00:27:18,625
The woman Nile's
been dreaming about?

272
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:24,083
I've written books on
every single immortal.

273
00:27:24,166 --> 00:27:25,833
You, your friends,
the work that they...

274
00:27:25,916 --> 00:27:27,375
Who is she, Tuah?

275
00:27:28,875 --> 00:27:31,125
She's gone by many
names over the years.

276
00:27:31,208 --> 00:27:32,583
She goes by Discord now.

277
00:27:33,666 --> 00:27:34,750
Sounds ominous.

278
00:27:34,833 --> 00:27:35,958
As it should.

279
00:27:37,083 --> 00:27:38,958
She was the first of
our kind that I had met.

280
00:27:40,041 --> 00:27:41,250
A long time ago.

281
00:27:41,875 --> 00:27:43,041
How long?

282
00:27:44,958 --> 00:27:47,291
She is older than any of us.

283
00:27:49,750 --> 00:27:52,833
She is the first
of the immortals.

284
00:27:52,916 --> 00:27:53,916
No.

285
00:27:54,250 --> 00:27:56,166
No, Andromache is the first.

286
00:27:59,583 --> 00:28:00,833
What are you saying?

287
00:28:00,916 --> 00:28:03,666
I… I… I found no trace
of anyone earlier.

288
00:28:04,166 --> 00:28:06,333
-By design.
-What do you mean, "by design"?

289
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:10,416
There was a time where we
walked together peacefully.

290
00:28:11,208 --> 00:28:12,916
But over the centuries,

291
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,625
we saw how fear of
those who are different

292
00:28:15,708 --> 00:28:18,333
can turn even good men cruel.

293
00:28:28,291 --> 00:28:29,750
We have to do something.

294
00:28:30,916 --> 00:28:31,916
They're like us.

295
00:28:32,416 --> 00:28:34,500
Please! No! No!

296
00:28:45,208 --> 00:28:48,208
Such evil cannot be unseen.

297
00:28:55,875 --> 00:28:58,541
No! No! No!

298
00:28:58,625 --> 00:28:59,958
Quynh!

299
00:29:00,041 --> 00:29:03,125
Quynh!

300
00:29:04,583 --> 00:29:06,375
That was the day you saved me.

301
00:29:06,958 --> 00:29:08,041
She was there too?

302
00:29:08,958 --> 00:29:09,958
Yes.

303
00:29:12,291 --> 00:29:16,500
Afterwards, I retreated
to my books, my research.

304
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,541
And Discord retreated too.

305
00:29:19,125 --> 00:29:23,500
Then she spent the next five centuries
amassing untold wealth and power

306
00:29:24,250 --> 00:29:26,291
so as not to fear
enemy or attack.

307
00:29:27,083 --> 00:29:29,166
Dealing arms with
people like Konrad.

308
00:29:34,708 --> 00:29:36,875
What does she want
from us, Tuah?

309
00:29:36,958 --> 00:29:37,958
I don't know.

310
00:29:38,041 --> 00:29:40,541
She's not the same
person that I once knew.

311
00:29:40,625 --> 00:29:44,250
And now that she knows your
histories, your relationships,

312
00:29:44,833 --> 00:29:47,958
I believe that all of
you could be in danger.

313
00:29:50,333 --> 00:29:52,500
It's been millennia
since I've been afraid.

314
00:29:53,708 --> 00:29:56,916
But I am scared of
what she is capable of,

315
00:29:58,083 --> 00:29:59,458
and so should you.

316
00:30:05,666 --> 00:30:06,666
Tuah.

317
00:30:09,291 --> 00:30:11,291
Do you think there's a chance

318
00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:14,916
she might know that I've
lost my immortality?

319
00:30:17,625 --> 00:30:18,791
How long has it been?

320
00:30:21,750 --> 00:30:23,166
Around six months.

321
00:30:26,250 --> 00:30:27,541
Andromache.

322
00:30:31,125 --> 00:30:32,666
I think you should pack a bag.

323
00:30:33,750 --> 00:30:35,125
I already have.

324
00:30:38,416 --> 00:30:41,708
Because I knew what
you were gonna say.

325
00:30:41,791 --> 00:30:43,833
No. You thought you
knew what I'd say.

326
00:30:44,416 --> 00:30:45,583
You lied to us.

327
00:30:45,666 --> 00:30:46,791
They're back.

328
00:30:46,875 --> 00:30:48,625
-Hey.
-Hey.

329
00:30:50,041 --> 00:30:51,333
Who's this?

330
00:30:53,875 --> 00:30:56,541
This is Tuah, an
old friend of mine.

331
00:30:56,625 --> 00:30:57,750
"An old friend"?

332
00:30:59,083 --> 00:31:01,458
You knew there was another,
and you never told us?

333
00:31:02,916 --> 00:31:04,625
Boss, you lied to us?

334
00:31:05,416 --> 00:31:06,250
I didn't lie. I...

335
00:31:06,333 --> 00:31:08,333
A lie of omission
is still a lie.

336
00:31:08,833 --> 00:31:12,291
In Andromache's defense, I asked
her not to tell anyone of me.

337
00:31:13,916 --> 00:31:15,791
Something's happened to Booker.

338
00:31:16,541 --> 00:31:17,541
What?

339
00:31:20,333 --> 00:31:22,583
-Did you go see him?
-It's not like that.

340
00:31:25,041 --> 00:31:28,916
Yusuf went to see him. They've
been talking the entire time.

341
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,833
-We went to his place in Paris.
-Blood everywhere.

342
00:31:33,583 --> 00:31:34,583
Discord.

343
00:31:36,166 --> 00:31:37,166
Possibly.

344
00:31:37,708 --> 00:31:40,916
What else do we know about her?

345
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,166
I mean, where she lives, her…

346
00:31:43,875 --> 00:31:45,791
Her habits, her MO.

347
00:32:02,291 --> 00:32:03,291
It's Booker.

348
00:32:04,583 --> 00:32:06,833
Don't worry, boss. We got this.

349
00:32:08,833 --> 00:32:09,958
We have to.

350
00:32:33,416 --> 00:32:34,500
Thanks for coming.

351
00:32:38,333 --> 00:32:40,083
-Joe.
-Hey.

352
00:32:43,916 --> 00:32:45,208
-What happened?
-Hmm.

353
00:32:47,541 --> 00:32:49,125
I need to see Andy.

354
00:33:13,166 --> 00:33:14,166
Andy.

355
00:33:18,958 --> 00:33:20,208
She's out.

356
00:33:22,916 --> 00:33:23,875
What?

357
00:33:23,958 --> 00:33:25,166
Quynh.

358
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,625
She couldn't find
you, so she found me.

359
00:33:59,583 --> 00:34:01,000
Andromache.

360
00:34:02,375 --> 00:34:04,958
I have returned to a world

361
00:34:05,041 --> 00:34:08,875
darker than the tomb
I finally escaped,

362
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:15,291
only to learn you have
gone on living in it freely

363
00:34:16,083 --> 00:34:18,166
all these centuries.

364
00:34:19,875 --> 00:34:24,583
I need to hear the words that
will free me from my true prison.

365
00:34:27,250 --> 00:34:29,125
That of a broken promise.

366
00:34:29,916 --> 00:34:31,250
You and me.

367
00:34:32,750 --> 00:34:33,833
Until the end.

368
00:34:34,333 --> 00:34:36,916
Find me where you always could.

369
00:34:44,291 --> 00:34:45,625
I have to go meet her.

370
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,416
-Andy, don't.
-It's Quynh.

371
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:55,708
Give her space, Nile.

372
00:34:57,458 --> 00:35:00,375
Andy, she could have reached
out to you in a million ways.

373
00:35:00,458 --> 00:35:03,166
Instead, she kidnaps Booker and
does all this for face time?

374
00:35:03,250 --> 00:35:04,333
That seem sane to you?

375
00:35:04,416 --> 00:35:07,916
For 1,500 years, it was just her and
me. What do you know about her, Nile?

376
00:35:09,166 --> 00:35:12,000
I know you can die and I can't.

377
00:35:12,708 --> 00:35:15,208
And I know your head's not on
straight when it comes to her.

378
00:35:15,291 --> 00:35:18,791
So tell me, if our places were
swapped, would you let me go alone?

379
00:35:29,791 --> 00:35:31,541
So I guess you must be, uh,

380
00:35:32,666 --> 00:35:33,666
Tuah, right?

381
00:35:33,750 --> 00:35:35,750
It's good to meet you
finally, Sébastien.

382
00:35:35,833 --> 00:35:38,916
-Do you mind if I call you Booker?
-Whichever you like.

383
00:35:41,708 --> 00:35:44,000
How long are you guys
gonna keep this up?

384
00:35:44,083 --> 00:35:46,083
This whole cold
shoulder bit. Hmm?

385
00:35:46,166 --> 00:35:48,833
How do we know you haven't
sold us out again, Book?

386
00:35:49,416 --> 00:35:50,750
Come on.

387
00:35:56,916 --> 00:35:58,166
Well, I, uh…

388
00:35:59,833 --> 00:36:01,083
I guess you don't.

389
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,208
Andromache.

390
00:37:30,166 --> 00:37:32,083
This is not who you are.

391
00:37:49,833 --> 00:37:51,625
Woke up alone in the car.

392
00:37:53,083 --> 00:37:54,666
Thought you ditched me.

393
00:37:55,666 --> 00:37:56,875
Thought about it.

394
00:37:59,666 --> 00:38:01,208
Anything I can do?

395
00:38:04,916 --> 00:38:07,375
Can you give me
back five centuries?

396
00:38:09,375 --> 00:38:10,625
Wish I could.

397
00:38:26,250 --> 00:38:28,250
What if she doesn't
recognize me?

398
00:38:32,500 --> 00:38:34,375
I don't mean physically, but…

399
00:38:35,666 --> 00:38:37,083
Who I've become.

400
00:38:44,250 --> 00:38:46,208
What if I don't recognize her?

401
00:38:48,083 --> 00:38:50,791
Andy, I've never
seen you like this.

402
00:38:59,791 --> 00:39:02,000
I've been like this
for hundreds of years.

403
00:39:24,875 --> 00:39:26,458
I'll be right behind you.

404
00:39:29,916 --> 00:39:30,916
Okay.

405
00:40:06,375 --> 00:40:08,625
Excuse me, can I use
this phone for a second?

406
00:40:08,708 --> 00:40:09,708
Of course.

407
00:41:41,666 --> 00:41:43,125
I don't know how to…

408
00:41:46,791 --> 00:41:49,500
There are no words to
explain how I failed you.

409
00:41:58,875 --> 00:42:00,666
Can you imagine it?

410
00:42:02,083 --> 00:42:03,291
Trapped

411
00:42:04,333 --> 00:42:05,333
in the dark.

412
00:42:06,791 --> 00:42:08,708
Every muscle

413
00:42:09,208 --> 00:42:11,250
screaming for air.

414
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:17,583
My life returning
just long enough…

415
00:42:19,625 --> 00:42:21,208
To remember,

416
00:42:22,458 --> 00:42:23,458
to hope.

417
00:42:28,291 --> 00:42:29,750
I'm so sorry.

418
00:42:32,458 --> 00:42:34,000
I'm so sorry.

419
00:42:51,583 --> 00:42:53,250
How long have you been back?

420
00:42:54,375 --> 00:42:55,583
Months.

421
00:42:56,958 --> 00:42:58,708
Why didn't you come
find me sooner?

422
00:42:58,791 --> 00:43:02,875
You couldn't even find me
in one small area of ocean.

423
00:43:03,541 --> 00:43:04,791
I searched.

424
00:43:05,875 --> 00:43:07,791
I did. I searched
for centuries...

425
00:43:07,875 --> 00:43:09,250
But you stopped.

426
00:43:34,708 --> 00:43:35,708
Quynh.

427
00:43:40,250 --> 00:43:41,250
Look at me.

428
00:43:47,375 --> 00:43:49,125
You once told me…

429
00:43:51,500 --> 00:43:55,416
The only thing you
fear is being alone.

430
00:43:59,083 --> 00:44:01,958
The way it was before we
found each other, Andromache.

431
00:44:05,208 --> 00:44:07,291
-I am alone.
-You're not.

432
00:44:07,375 --> 00:44:08,625
You have me.

433
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,583
You have Joe and Nicky.

434
00:44:14,500 --> 00:44:15,500
Quynh.

435
00:44:18,875 --> 00:44:20,000
Come home.

436
00:44:21,208 --> 00:44:22,458
You can join us.

437
00:44:22,958 --> 00:44:25,625
You're asking me to join you

438
00:44:26,375 --> 00:44:28,250
and your endless war?

439
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:30,125
Huh?

440
00:44:30,208 --> 00:44:31,916
Fight beside you?

441
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:36,458
Fight for mortals, the ones who drowned
me in a coffin at the bottom of the sea?

442
00:44:36,958 --> 00:44:39,458
You have no idea

443
00:44:40,625 --> 00:44:41,833
what has happened.

444
00:44:45,166 --> 00:44:46,166
I can't…

445
00:44:48,083 --> 00:44:49,583
I can't leave them.

446
00:44:54,333 --> 00:44:55,375
I'm not…

447
00:44:59,625 --> 00:45:00,708
What?

448
00:45:07,291 --> 00:45:09,625
Looks like you have
made your decision.

449
00:45:09,708 --> 00:45:10,708
Don't.

450
00:45:12,125 --> 00:45:13,583
Quynh, wait.

451
00:45:21,916 --> 00:45:23,291
Stay back.

452
00:45:50,083 --> 00:45:51,083
Quynh.

453
00:46:02,250 --> 00:46:04,166
Wait. I don't wanna fight.

454
00:46:40,833 --> 00:46:45,500
I remember the woman I gave that
necklace to a long time ago.

455
00:46:47,125 --> 00:46:48,625
And you're not her.

456
00:47:09,458 --> 00:47:10,541
Shit! Andy.

457
00:47:11,041 --> 00:47:12,041
Hey!

458
00:47:14,958 --> 00:47:16,375
Shut it down.

459
00:47:16,875 --> 00:47:18,416
Discord's here.

460
00:47:29,708 --> 00:47:31,833
Nile! No, no, no.

461
00:47:31,916 --> 00:47:33,041
That's Nile?

462
00:47:37,833 --> 00:47:39,500
What do you know about Nile?

463
00:47:44,666 --> 00:47:45,791
Discord.

464
00:47:46,958 --> 00:47:48,500
That's how you got out?

465
00:47:50,583 --> 00:47:51,958
You're with Discord.

466
00:48:00,291 --> 00:48:01,541
Stop!

467
00:48:02,583 --> 00:48:03,666
Stop.

468
00:48:15,458 --> 00:48:18,916
I curse you for
all your lifetimes!

469
00:49:29,500 --> 00:49:32,333
Clever. Hiding in a church.

470
00:49:34,250 --> 00:49:36,250
But you can't stay here forever.

471
00:49:36,750 --> 00:49:38,666
I didn't think we'd
be meeting so soon.

472
00:49:42,250 --> 00:49:43,750
I was there, you know.

473
00:49:44,791 --> 00:49:46,083
I can still remember it.

474
00:49:48,208 --> 00:49:50,833
The acrid stench
of hate in the air.

475
00:49:54,666 --> 00:49:56,083
Tell me, Nile Freeman,

476
00:49:56,583 --> 00:50:00,708
how does a good Christian girl like
you stomach what Andromache's doing?

477
00:50:01,291 --> 00:50:03,583
Playing God with mankind.

478
00:50:04,166 --> 00:50:06,000
We're not playing God.

479
00:50:06,083 --> 00:50:08,750
We're helping. We're
doing what's right.

480
00:50:09,291 --> 00:50:12,000
Did it feel right leaving
your family behind?

481
00:50:12,708 --> 00:50:14,458
Letting them think
you were dead?

482
00:50:16,375 --> 00:50:18,125
That's what she made
you do, isn't it?

483
00:50:18,208 --> 00:50:21,291
That was my decision, my choice.

484
00:50:22,083 --> 00:50:24,000
None of you had a choice.

485
00:50:24,625 --> 00:50:25,708
Not with her.

486
00:50:32,208 --> 00:50:35,666
Andromache's obsession with
interfering with human affairs

487
00:50:35,750 --> 00:50:38,125
is the reason we're hunted.

488
00:50:39,583 --> 00:50:42,000
You will make your friends stop

489
00:50:42,875 --> 00:50:43,958
or I will.

490
00:50:45,416 --> 00:50:48,041
You are the last immortal.

491
00:50:48,625 --> 00:50:50,833
There will be none
born after you.

492
00:50:57,333 --> 00:51:00,583
And you have a power you
can't even imagine yet.

493
00:51:04,083 --> 00:51:05,958
One day you'll understand.

494
00:51:07,291 --> 00:51:11,416
You and I are going to end
immortal interference together.

495
00:51:12,500 --> 00:51:13,958
I'm not doing anything with you.

496
00:51:14,041 --> 00:51:15,750
We're connected.

497
00:51:16,708 --> 00:51:18,833
Do you have a birthmark
on your left arm?

498
00:51:25,166 --> 00:51:26,416
The first immortal

499
00:51:27,250 --> 00:51:28,583
and the last.

500
00:51:29,458 --> 00:51:31,666
I'll see you soon, Nile.

501
00:51:57,208 --> 00:51:59,833
Clearly Discord has
the ability to find us.

502
00:52:01,125 --> 00:52:04,000
But now we have all the
surveillance footage from Rome.

503
00:52:04,083 --> 00:52:07,208
Next time Discord or
Quynh walks past a camera,

504
00:52:08,708 --> 00:52:09,916
we'll know where they are.

505
00:52:13,250 --> 00:52:15,250
-Well, that's something.
-What does it mean?

506
00:52:17,500 --> 00:52:18,625
"I'm the last."

507
00:52:20,291 --> 00:52:23,000
Discord knows something
about you we don't,

508
00:52:23,083 --> 00:52:25,125
and we need to figure it out.

509
00:52:25,666 --> 00:52:28,750
So what do we do about Quynh?

510
00:52:32,500 --> 00:52:33,500
I don't know.

511
00:53:33,708 --> 00:53:34,708
Booker.

512
00:53:35,166 --> 00:53:36,875
Are you working on something?

513
00:53:39,375 --> 00:53:40,416
Always.

514
00:53:45,916 --> 00:53:47,000
Tell me something.

515
00:53:49,458 --> 00:53:50,541
At any point,

516
00:53:51,583 --> 00:53:53,583
has Nile ever wounded Andy?

517
00:53:54,583 --> 00:53:56,916
Yeah. When they first
met, they fought.

518
00:53:58,375 --> 00:54:00,416
Uh, Nile stabbed Andy.

519
00:54:02,666 --> 00:54:03,666
Why?

520
00:54:06,750 --> 00:54:08,083
Well, I, uh…

521
00:54:09,708 --> 00:54:14,083
I have a theory that that is the reason
why Andy has lost her immortality.

522
00:54:16,041 --> 00:54:17,666
What are you talking about?

523
00:54:18,791 --> 00:54:21,625
Any day, any one of us
could wake up mortal, right?

524
00:54:24,166 --> 00:54:26,625
Nothing that lives…
lives forever.

525
00:54:33,166 --> 00:54:34,541
There was a legend

526
00:54:34,625 --> 00:54:37,750
that Discord and I had
heard of centuries ago.

527
00:54:39,083 --> 00:54:40,375
It tells

528
00:54:41,750 --> 00:54:44,625
that a wound from
the last immortal

529
00:54:44,708 --> 00:54:49,250
has the power to take away
anyone else's immortality.

530
00:54:51,750 --> 00:54:54,458
So Nile is the
reason Andy's mortal?

531
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:56,000
Hmm.

532
00:54:57,291 --> 00:55:01,416
Well, I believe that
Discord is going to use Nile

533
00:55:01,500 --> 00:55:03,208
to try to kill all of us.

534
00:55:05,791 --> 00:55:06,958
But there's more.

535
00:55:07,041 --> 00:55:10,333
The legend also states
that the wounded immortal

536
00:55:10,416 --> 00:55:14,875
may bestow the gift of immortality
to another before it is lost.

537
00:55:19,375 --> 00:55:20,541
A transfer.

538
00:55:21,250 --> 00:55:22,416
Precisely.

539
00:55:23,916 --> 00:55:25,541
But it has to be
willingly given.

540
00:55:28,458 --> 00:55:32,000
So Andy could… become
immortal again?

541
00:55:34,708 --> 00:55:37,250
If one of us become mortal, yes.

542
00:55:40,083 --> 00:55:41,250
But again,

543
00:55:41,833 --> 00:55:43,208
it's just a theory.

544
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:52,000
Andy?

545
00:55:52,916 --> 00:55:54,875
Can I talk to you for a sec?

546
00:55:54,958 --> 00:55:55,958
Sure.

547
00:56:01,583 --> 00:56:04,041
I just wanted to tell you,
after all of this is over,

548
00:56:04,125 --> 00:56:05,625
I'll probably go.

549
00:56:06,125 --> 00:56:08,625
Don't be stupid,
Book. We need you.

550
00:56:09,916 --> 00:56:11,750
We never should have
left you behind.

551
00:56:13,208 --> 00:56:14,916
You did what you had to do.

552
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:16,458
I deserved it.

553
00:56:16,541 --> 00:56:17,541
Sit down.

554
00:56:20,041 --> 00:56:23,833
You remember the moment you left
me? You told me to have faith.

555
00:56:25,125 --> 00:56:26,125
Right?

556
00:56:27,291 --> 00:56:29,416
Well, the thing is, I, uh…

557
00:56:29,500 --> 00:56:30,541
I didn't,

558
00:56:31,375 --> 00:56:32,666
and it wrecked me.

559
00:56:34,041 --> 00:56:37,333
Seeing you walk away, thinking
I'd never see you again…

560
00:56:39,541 --> 00:56:41,458
Was, uh…

561
00:56:43,541 --> 00:56:47,750
But life is funny 'cause
here I am talking to you.

562
00:56:49,208 --> 00:56:51,166
I'm really grateful for that.

563
00:56:53,791 --> 00:56:56,041
We've known each other too long.

564
00:56:57,125 --> 00:57:00,500
Yeah, so many things I
left unsaid all the time.

565
00:57:04,666 --> 00:57:07,333
When you get to do things
over and over again,

566
00:57:07,416 --> 00:57:10,083
forever, without
expiration date, that's…

567
00:57:10,166 --> 00:57:13,041
That's where you forget to
say things to one another.

568
00:57:17,625 --> 00:57:19,791
I'd love an expiration date.

569
00:57:21,750 --> 00:57:22,833
You know why?

570
00:57:25,083 --> 00:57:26,833
'Cause it gives meaning.

571
00:57:30,875 --> 00:57:32,041
What I mean is,

572
00:57:32,125 --> 00:57:35,250
maybe this is the perfect
time for Quynh to be back.

573
00:57:41,750 --> 00:57:43,333
You wish for something

574
00:57:44,291 --> 00:57:45,625
for so long…

575
00:57:51,041 --> 00:57:52,833
But it's just not that simple.

576
00:57:53,416 --> 00:57:55,791
She's betraying you out of hurt.

577
00:57:58,375 --> 00:58:00,083
It's not over yet.

578
00:58:01,083 --> 00:58:03,041
We always make it through.

579
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:07,583
Have a little faith, Andy.

580
00:58:11,250 --> 00:58:12,791
And get some sleep.

581
00:58:42,750 --> 00:58:44,125
She let you down again.

582
00:58:45,458 --> 00:58:46,583
I'm sorry.

583
00:58:53,333 --> 00:58:57,333
I pulled you from the ocean
because I needed you by my side.

584
00:58:58,666 --> 00:59:01,791
You may have lost Andromache,
but you don't have to be alone.

585
00:59:03,750 --> 00:59:05,250
How can I help you, Quynh?

586
00:59:07,083 --> 00:59:09,666
I want them to suffer.

587
00:59:11,458 --> 00:59:14,166
Andromache and the
others, they will.

588
00:59:17,125 --> 00:59:18,125
No.

589
00:59:21,083 --> 00:59:22,500
Everyone.

590
00:59:25,083 --> 00:59:27,166
That I can help you with.

591
01:01:28,125 --> 01:01:29,250
Drop your weapons.

592
01:02:28,625 --> 01:02:30,083
Show me what you got.

593
01:02:34,333 --> 01:02:35,333
Really?

594
01:02:36,416 --> 01:02:37,666
Why not?

595
01:02:37,750 --> 01:02:39,833
I might be a couple
of hundred years old,

596
01:02:39,916 --> 01:02:41,750
but I can still teach
you a thing or two.

597
01:02:41,833 --> 01:02:44,250
Oh, you're gonna teach
me something? All right.

598
01:02:54,541 --> 01:02:56,208
Okay, Book.

599
01:02:58,166 --> 01:02:59,083
Hey, Tuah.

600
01:02:59,166 --> 01:03:01,708
You're just in time to watch
me school this old man.

601
01:03:01,791 --> 01:03:04,208
-Go easy on me. It's been a while.
-Mm-hmm.

602
01:03:04,291 --> 01:03:06,375
Perhaps you're not
ready for this, Booker.

603
01:03:06,458 --> 01:03:07,458
All right.

604
01:03:17,666 --> 01:03:19,500
How am I doing, Tuah?

605
01:03:20,208 --> 01:03:21,625
You're a natural.

606
01:03:22,375 --> 01:03:23,708
I would like a chance too.

607
01:03:23,791 --> 01:03:26,291
Nah, let me play a little.

608
01:03:26,375 --> 01:03:27,625
I insist.

609
01:03:31,833 --> 01:03:32,833
All right.

610
01:04:06,541 --> 01:04:08,000
Shit.

611
01:04:08,083 --> 01:04:09,083
Argh!

612
01:04:09,166 --> 01:04:10,416
Sorry, Book.

613
01:04:10,500 --> 01:04:12,625
No, it's all right.

614
01:04:13,250 --> 01:04:15,041
That was fun.

615
01:04:19,083 --> 01:04:20,458
I'm gonna take care of this.

616
01:04:20,541 --> 01:04:21,625
All right.

617
01:04:22,791 --> 01:04:24,041
I'll be back.

618
01:04:30,541 --> 01:04:31,958
You shouldn't have done that.

619
01:04:33,666 --> 01:04:35,583
I told you it was just a theory.

620
01:04:35,666 --> 01:04:37,708
Only a theory.

621
01:04:38,583 --> 01:04:42,416
I can already tell.
It's… it's not healing.

622
01:04:47,208 --> 01:04:48,958
Then we don't have
much time left.

623
01:04:50,250 --> 01:04:53,166
Remember, it must
be given willingly.

624
01:04:56,541 --> 01:04:59,291
Tuah, you understand

625
01:04:59,375 --> 01:05:01,333
Andy can't know about this.

626
01:05:03,666 --> 01:05:04,791
She can't.

627
01:05:05,875 --> 01:05:07,000
Promise me.

628
01:05:20,916 --> 01:05:22,791
They're just outside Jakarta.

629
01:05:22,875 --> 01:05:25,041
We need to get everyone
together in the library.

630
01:05:25,541 --> 01:05:26,666
I'll be right there.

631
01:05:29,166 --> 01:05:31,125
You do something stupid again?

632
01:05:32,250 --> 01:05:33,958
Yeah, well, you know me.

633
01:05:34,541 --> 01:05:35,833
As usual.

634
01:05:37,500 --> 01:05:39,125
Copley wants us to
meet downstairs.

635
01:05:40,125 --> 01:05:41,125
All right.

636
01:06:12,208 --> 01:06:13,333
You okay?

637
01:06:13,416 --> 01:06:15,000
Yeah.

638
01:06:15,083 --> 01:06:17,500
It's just been a while,
you know. It's not for me.

639
01:06:19,041 --> 01:06:20,625
Meet you downstairs.

640
01:06:34,541 --> 01:06:36,666
The nuclear facility
is a black site.

641
01:06:37,416 --> 01:06:40,458
Privately owned by the
Chinese on Indonesian soil.

642
01:06:40,541 --> 01:06:41,958
It's not meant to exist.

643
01:06:42,500 --> 01:06:44,458
The confusion could be helpful.

644
01:06:44,958 --> 01:06:45,833
Yes.

645
01:06:45,916 --> 01:06:50,458
This is the security footage that
my contacts were able to obtain

646
01:06:50,541 --> 01:06:54,833
before all outside
contact was cut off.

647
01:07:00,458 --> 01:07:03,208
We have to assume that
her black ops team

648
01:07:03,291 --> 01:07:05,041
has full control of the system,

649
01:07:05,541 --> 01:07:07,625
from the control room
to the coolant chamber.

650
01:07:09,416 --> 01:07:11,000
Now, look at the
large structure here.

651
01:07:11,500 --> 01:07:12,833
It's the core.

652
01:07:12,916 --> 01:07:14,833
It appears that, inside here,

653
01:07:14,916 --> 01:07:16,166
they've, uh,

654
01:07:17,166 --> 01:07:18,750
planted a device.

655
01:07:24,291 --> 01:07:28,083
We should assume that it could
create an explosion that would…

656
01:07:30,375 --> 01:07:31,500
Breach the facility.

657
01:07:31,583 --> 01:07:34,791
And irradiate the entire area.

658
01:07:34,875 --> 01:07:36,375
Ten million people.

659
01:07:37,666 --> 01:07:39,916
They've planted shaped charges

660
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:43,166
capable of incapacitating
any one of you

661
01:07:43,250 --> 01:07:47,083
for an extended and
vulnerable period of time.

662
01:07:47,750 --> 01:07:48,958
It's a trap.

663
01:07:49,541 --> 01:07:51,875
Discord is using
the bomb like bait.

664
01:07:51,958 --> 01:07:56,083
She knows we'll try to stop her, and
we're playing right into her hands.

665
01:07:56,166 --> 01:07:57,958
That's exactly what she told me.

666
01:07:58,541 --> 01:08:00,041
She wants us.

667
01:08:01,250 --> 01:08:02,375
All of us.

668
01:08:04,166 --> 01:08:06,666
Whatever their motives
are, a bomb is a bomb.

669
01:08:06,750 --> 01:08:09,916
And both of them are willing to
blow it to get what they want.

670
01:08:11,958 --> 01:08:13,000
We don't have a choice.

671
01:08:14,291 --> 01:08:15,333
We have to go.

672
01:08:17,125 --> 01:08:18,125
Gear up.

673
01:08:29,833 --> 01:08:30,833
Thanks.

674
01:08:54,875 --> 01:08:58,583
Do you remember that game we used to
play in Ireland at the Cliffs of Moher?

675
01:09:00,125 --> 01:09:01,125
Yeah.

676
01:09:01,583 --> 01:09:03,041
Running towards the edge?

677
01:09:03,125 --> 01:09:06,125
See who chickens out first?

678
01:09:06,625 --> 01:09:08,000
You never gave up.

679
01:09:09,625 --> 01:09:10,708
No.

680
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:18,041
Talk to me.

681
01:09:20,166 --> 01:09:22,041
I can't shake this fear, Nicky.

682
01:09:24,958 --> 01:09:26,375
And what are you afraid of?

683
01:09:29,500 --> 01:09:30,625
We could end.

684
01:09:34,166 --> 01:09:37,875
You know, Andromache, she
walks 3,000 years alone

685
01:09:37,958 --> 01:09:39,583
before she found Quynh.

686
01:09:41,500 --> 01:09:43,916
But me and you, we were
together from the start.

687
01:09:44,416 --> 01:09:48,250
I can't look at us and
believe it is arbitrary.

688
01:09:52,125 --> 01:09:53,291
Things end.

689
01:09:53,875 --> 01:09:56,500
What I feel when I see you,

690
01:09:58,041 --> 01:09:59,583
when I see your heart…

691
01:10:02,875 --> 01:10:04,416
That's truly immortal.

692
01:10:47,750 --> 01:10:49,833
It would be ill-advised

693
01:10:49,916 --> 01:10:52,791
to discharge any firearm in
the vicinity of the core.

694
01:10:53,708 --> 01:10:55,625
James, negative contact.

695
01:10:56,208 --> 01:10:58,625
Yeah, that means you'll
meet resistance further in.

696
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:03,583
Remember, we have to assume they
have our positions at all times.

697
01:11:08,125 --> 01:11:09,791
Okay, doors on the south side.

698
01:11:10,708 --> 01:11:12,416
Through them, up the stairs.

699
01:11:22,166 --> 01:11:25,958
Stay along the wall and you're in
the upper levels of the reactor.

700
01:11:31,541 --> 01:11:32,583
Any movement?

701
01:11:33,166 --> 01:11:36,416
-Still nothing.
-Joe, anything on your side?

702
01:11:36,500 --> 01:11:38,625
Negative contact
on this side too.

703
01:11:42,875 --> 01:11:43,916
Shaped charge.

704
01:11:46,875 --> 01:11:49,875
Expect additional small explosives
throughout the compound.

705
01:11:50,458 --> 01:11:54,083
Maybe they're not stupid enough
to stay in a nuclear facility,

706
01:11:54,166 --> 01:11:56,625
now that they've set
a bomb to blow it up.

707
01:12:30,375 --> 01:12:32,708
Okay, they wanna
go hand-to-hand.

708
01:12:33,291 --> 01:12:35,291
Remember, there's
always an asshole.

709
01:12:44,583 --> 01:12:46,541
Go, go, go! Move!

710
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:29,166
Nicky, get up!

711
01:13:41,375 --> 01:13:43,958
Get to the control
room. Open that door.

712
01:13:49,375 --> 01:13:51,083
Copley, which way do we go?

713
01:13:51,166 --> 01:13:54,041
All right. Okay. Down the
hall, through the corridor.

714
01:13:54,125 --> 01:13:56,041
It'll wrap around
to the control room.

715
01:14:33,583 --> 01:14:35,000
I found the asshole.

716
01:14:50,125 --> 01:14:52,416
Andy!

717
01:15:07,041 --> 01:15:08,166
Nile!

718
01:15:21,666 --> 01:15:22,958
Nile?

719
01:15:24,958 --> 01:15:27,541
If I can get into their system,
I can lead you to the bomb.

720
01:15:28,041 --> 01:15:29,250
We haven't much time.

721
01:15:35,125 --> 01:15:38,625
-The system has a firewall.
-Look for a manual override.

722
01:15:39,958 --> 01:15:41,583
There's no manual
override, Copley.

723
01:15:52,166 --> 01:15:53,916
This was her plan all along.

724
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:56,125
Discord wants to separate us.

725
01:16:11,541 --> 01:16:12,541
Copley?

726
01:16:46,416 --> 01:16:48,833
Tuah? Nicky? Joe?

727
01:16:48,916 --> 01:16:50,041
Nile.

728
01:17:11,041 --> 01:17:12,000
We're blocked.

729
01:17:12,083 --> 01:17:13,083
This way.

730
01:17:16,166 --> 01:17:18,000
Joe, Nicky, Nile!

731
01:17:18,500 --> 01:17:19,916
They're gone, Book.

732
01:17:20,500 --> 01:17:21,916
Discord is watching us.

733
01:17:27,500 --> 01:17:28,666
Let's go.

734
01:17:32,791 --> 01:17:36,208
She's controlling the doors.
She's trying to split us up.

735
01:17:38,583 --> 01:17:41,458
Book, when this door opens,
you have to go first.

736
01:17:41,541 --> 01:17:42,708
No, no, no. You go first.

737
01:17:42,791 --> 01:17:44,875
They're gonna slaughter
me if I go out there.

738
01:17:44,958 --> 01:17:45,875
You always go first.

739
01:17:45,958 --> 01:17:47,000
I'm not joking.

740
01:17:47,083 --> 01:17:48,375
Me neither, Andy.

741
01:17:51,291 --> 01:17:52,291
What?

742
01:17:52,791 --> 01:17:54,666
-I gave it to you.
-How?

743
01:17:55,625 --> 01:17:56,666
Stay behind me.

744
01:18:18,708 --> 01:18:21,125
I got my expiration date.

745
01:18:21,916 --> 01:18:23,833
You have a purpose.

746
01:18:25,750 --> 01:18:27,083
This is mine.

747
01:18:28,416 --> 01:18:29,541
Book!

748
01:18:32,541 --> 01:18:34,208
No! Book!

749
01:18:54,875 --> 01:18:56,000
No!

750
01:19:13,458 --> 01:19:15,125
Book!

751
01:19:27,833 --> 01:19:29,791
Book, I…

752
01:19:37,708 --> 01:19:39,041
Sébastien.

753
01:21:10,125 --> 01:21:11,125
You're alone.

754
01:21:12,250 --> 01:21:14,125
Give me the bomb, Quynh.

755
01:21:15,041 --> 01:21:16,458
Just go with Discord.

756
01:21:17,125 --> 01:21:18,541
Give her what she wants.

757
01:21:18,625 --> 01:21:20,375
She wants us dead.

758
01:21:22,583 --> 01:21:25,833
You stood with
Andy for centuries.

759
01:21:26,333 --> 01:21:28,125
Centuries.

760
01:21:28,208 --> 01:21:30,833
How could you betray
her like this?

761
01:21:37,625 --> 01:21:39,875
You know nothing
about me and Andy.

762
01:22:12,083 --> 01:22:13,083
What…

763
01:22:20,125 --> 01:22:21,166
I'm not…

764
01:22:22,875 --> 01:22:23,875
I'm not healing.

765
01:22:24,416 --> 01:22:25,500
Quynh…

766
01:22:25,583 --> 01:22:27,208
What have you done to me?

767
01:22:27,291 --> 01:22:28,583
I didn't…

768
01:22:30,916 --> 01:22:32,458
I'm sorry.

769
01:22:39,625 --> 01:22:41,083
Shh.

770
01:22:41,166 --> 01:22:42,333
It's okay.

771
01:23:46,500 --> 01:23:48,791
Nile! Joe!

772
01:23:49,916 --> 01:23:51,000
Nicky!

773
01:23:51,791 --> 01:23:52,791
Tuah!

774
01:24:56,458 --> 01:24:59,708
Is this where you tell me
that this isn't who I am?

775
01:25:08,041 --> 01:25:10,250
I used to think it was
my job to save you.

776
01:25:12,375 --> 01:25:13,666
But in the end,

777
01:25:14,666 --> 01:25:18,375
each one of us has to decide
for ourselves who we really are.

778
01:26:14,166 --> 01:26:15,916
Where is she taking them, Quynh?

779
01:26:17,750 --> 01:26:18,750
Where?

780
01:26:19,666 --> 01:26:20,750
I don't know.

781
01:26:31,333 --> 01:26:33,041
Bags loaded. Let's go!

782
01:28:44,750 --> 01:28:46,083
Circle around!

783
01:29:55,625 --> 01:29:56,916
Your hand isn't healing.

784
01:30:01,458 --> 01:30:02,458
You're mortal.

785
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:07,416
This had nothing to do with
immortal interference, did it?

786
01:30:07,500 --> 01:30:09,041
Don't look at me like that.

787
01:30:10,166 --> 01:30:12,750
Do you know what it's like
to wake up after an eternity

788
01:30:12,833 --> 01:30:15,166
and find yourself
suddenly mortal?

789
01:30:16,416 --> 01:30:18,375
Every minute

790
01:30:18,458 --> 01:30:20,583
is a step towards death.

791
01:30:21,250 --> 01:30:23,333
Time means nothing

792
01:30:24,416 --> 01:30:26,166
until it means everything.

793
01:30:26,250 --> 01:30:29,625
Time means nothing if
you give it no meaning.

794
01:30:34,458 --> 01:30:37,500
Your friends don't have
much time left, Andromache.

795
01:30:41,125 --> 01:30:42,416
That's your plan?

796
01:30:43,791 --> 01:30:44,958
You're gonna kill them?

797
01:30:45,458 --> 01:30:46,458
No.

798
01:30:47,750 --> 01:30:48,875
Nile will.

799
01:30:49,708 --> 01:30:51,375
She's a destroyer.

800
01:30:52,291 --> 01:30:54,541
She can take their immortality…

801
01:30:58,958 --> 01:31:00,500
And give it to me.

802
01:31:03,958 --> 01:31:05,208
She'll never hurt them.

803
01:31:06,458 --> 01:31:08,458
You think I'm gonna
give her a choice?

804
01:31:19,958 --> 01:31:22,458
You think your life means
more than one of theirs?

805
01:31:23,291 --> 01:31:25,333
To me, it does.

806
01:31:26,750 --> 01:31:29,375
I suspect the first
few won't be willing.

807
01:31:33,000 --> 01:31:34,166
And then again,

808
01:31:34,250 --> 01:31:37,000
torture goes a long way.

809
01:31:57,791 --> 01:32:00,000
I will come for them!

810
01:32:00,083 --> 01:32:03,583
And when you do, the
playing field will be level.

811
01:35:16,583 --> 01:35:20,583
There's a lot… I hate
about this century,

812
01:35:21,208 --> 01:35:22,333
but this

813
01:35:23,125 --> 01:35:24,125
I like.

814
01:35:39,958 --> 01:35:42,416
I never knew Discord was mortal.

815
01:35:47,291 --> 01:35:48,708
I'm gonna find them.

816
01:35:50,625 --> 01:35:52,125
The only question is…

817
01:35:54,250 --> 01:35:57,250
Are you gonna do what you do
best and fight by my side?

818
01:36:00,875 --> 01:36:01,875
No.

819
01:36:09,500 --> 01:36:11,958
You will fight by my side.

820
01:36:17,833 --> 01:36:21,333
-Where do you think you're going?
-I always go first.

821
01:36:21,416 --> 01:36:23,375
Not anymore, you don't.

822
01:36:23,458 --> 01:36:24,500
Try and keep up.

823
01:36:24,583 --> 01:36:26,291
-Oh yeah?
-Yep.
