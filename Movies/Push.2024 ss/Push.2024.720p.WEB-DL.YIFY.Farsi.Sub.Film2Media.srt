1
00:00:48,186 --> 00:00:50,671
Come away with me.

2
00:00:50,774 --> 00:00:52,742
Where?

3
00:00:52,845 --> 00:00:53,845
Home.

4
00:00:57,678 --> 00:00:59,231
America?

5
00:01:03,546 --> 00:01:04,547
You know I can't.

6
00:01:06,825 --> 00:01:10,104
Your family will understand.

7
00:01:10,208 --> 00:01:12,244
They can't expect you
to stay here forever.

8
00:01:21,702 --> 00:01:23,083
We'll be fine on our own.

9
00:01:24,808 --> 00:01:25,809
Promise.

10
00:01:30,987 --> 00:01:34,508
I'll think about it.

11
00:12:31,474 --> 00:12:32,510
You've got this.

12
00:14:49,371 --> 00:14:53,789
♪ If that mockingbird
don't sing ♪

13
00:14:53,893 --> 00:14:58,552
♪ Mama's gonna buy
you a diamond ring ♪

14
00:15:29,583 --> 00:15:36,245
Sorry about that... hello?

15
00:15:39,593 --> 00:15:40,663
Is anybody there?

16
00:16:12,350 --> 00:16:13,903
Sorry.

17
00:16:14,007 --> 00:16:16,078
No, it's fine.

18
00:16:16,182 --> 00:16:19,806
I just didn't expect
anyone else to show up.

19
00:16:19,909 --> 00:16:21,118
Is this the open house?

20
00:16:21,221 --> 00:16:24,914
Yes, yes, it is.

21
00:16:25,018 --> 00:16:26,502
I'm Natalie.

22
00:16:26,606 --> 00:16:28,021
Am I too late?

23
00:16:28,125 --> 00:16:31,266
Well, we're losing the
sun, but I think we

24
00:16:31,369 --> 00:16:34,786
can squeeze in a quick look.

25
00:16:34,890 --> 00:16:36,167
How'd you hear about us?

26
00:16:36,271 --> 00:16:38,963
I saw a sign at the
end of the turnpike.

27
00:16:39,067 --> 00:16:41,310
I always wonder if
people notice those.

28
00:16:48,835 --> 00:16:50,354
So the house is two stories.

29
00:16:50,457 --> 00:16:53,978
It's just under 14,000
square feet, including

30
00:16:54,082 --> 00:16:56,153
the basement and attic.

31
00:16:56,256 --> 00:16:59,294
It was built in 1890
and is registered

32
00:16:59,397 --> 00:17:02,366
with the Historic
Preservation Society.

33
00:17:02,469 --> 00:17:05,438
The original owners had this
added during Prohibition.

34
00:17:05,541 --> 00:17:09,131
All of the original
features are still intact

35
00:17:09,235 --> 00:17:14,378
and as you can see,
in pristine condition.

36
00:17:14,481 --> 00:17:16,207
There have been
small renovations

37
00:17:16,311 --> 00:17:19,762
in this room over the
years, but nothing major.

38
00:17:24,871 --> 00:17:26,079
Have you been looking long?

39
00:17:59,561 --> 00:18:03,289
There's still some
work to do down there,

40
00:18:03,392 --> 00:18:05,291
but it has a lot of potential.

41
00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:21,307
This is the master bedroom.

42
00:18:29,073 --> 00:18:30,833
All of the furniture
is included.

43
00:18:43,570 --> 00:18:45,641
What's the deal with the owners?

44
00:18:48,403 --> 00:18:51,923
They died actually,
here on the property.

45
00:18:55,479 --> 00:18:58,827
I don't know all the details,
but I was told they...

46
00:18:58,930 --> 00:19:00,173
they were murdered.

47
00:19:02,831 --> 00:19:06,731
It's almost like
they're still here.

48
00:19:06,835 --> 00:19:07,836
Unable to leave.

49
00:19:10,114 --> 00:19:15,050
I don't believe in
that kind of stuff.

50
00:19:15,154 --> 00:19:17,535
Maybe you should.

51
00:19:17,639 --> 00:19:18,639
No.

52
00:19:20,883 --> 00:19:23,300
Maybe that's why no
one showed up today.

53
00:19:25,854 --> 00:19:31,480
How... how did you know
no one showed up today?

54
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:41,007
It's getting pretty dark.

55
00:19:41,110 --> 00:19:42,422
We should wrap this up.

56
00:19:42,526 --> 00:19:46,150
Um, I have to get back.

57
00:19:46,254 --> 00:19:48,739
I have a... a long drive.

58
00:20:09,380 --> 00:20:10,623
Thank you for coming.

59
00:20:32,231 --> 00:20:33,370
Freak.

60
00:20:59,327 --> 00:21:00,500
What?

61
00:21:08,267 --> 00:21:09,509
You gotta be kidding me.

62
00:23:45,458 --> 00:23:46,597
Hello?

63
00:25:21,381 --> 00:25:22,521
Hello?

64
00:25:25,109 --> 00:25:26,525
Hello?

65
00:25:26,628 --> 00:25:27,560
Is anyone there?

66
00:27:25,816 --> 00:27:28,232
You know, I tried
calling earlier.

67
00:27:28,336 --> 00:27:29,786
Nobody picked up.

68
00:27:29,889 --> 00:27:31,166
That was you?

69
00:27:33,237 --> 00:27:35,032
It's a cool place.

70
00:27:35,136 --> 00:27:36,033
Yours?

71
00:27:36,137 --> 00:27:37,310
No.

72
00:27:37,414 --> 00:27:39,002
Trying to sell it.

73
00:27:39,105 --> 00:27:41,452
My boss says it's unsellable.

74
00:27:41,556 --> 00:27:43,558
Been in the market for years.

75
00:27:43,662 --> 00:27:45,836
Yeah, why is that?

76
00:27:45,940 --> 00:27:49,219
Just weird stuff.

77
00:27:49,322 --> 00:27:51,290
Previous owners died.

78
00:27:51,393 --> 00:27:55,259
Few other freak accidents
over the years after that.

79
00:27:55,363 --> 00:27:58,193
I guess now people
think it's cursed.

80
00:28:00,126 --> 00:28:03,923
Hey, were you messing around
with this before I got here?

81
00:28:04,027 --> 00:28:04,959
No.

82
00:28:05,062 --> 00:28:05,925
Why?

83
00:28:06,029 --> 00:28:07,340
You got a stripped bolt here.

84
00:28:07,444 --> 00:28:13,208
Could you excuse
me for a moment?

85
00:28:34,540 --> 00:28:36,404
We're having a rough day, huh?

86
00:28:39,614 --> 00:28:42,548
Make a deal with you.

87
00:28:42,651 --> 00:28:45,689
You help me get
through the night,

88
00:28:45,793 --> 00:28:47,277
I'll sing your favorite song.

89
00:29:45,231 --> 00:29:46,750
See?

90
00:29:46,854 --> 00:29:48,441
We'll be just fine on our own.

91
00:30:08,047 --> 00:30:09,462
What's happening?

92
00:32:34,573 --> 00:32:36,816
What the fuck?

93
00:32:48,897 --> 00:32:50,313
To hell with this.

94
00:32:56,802 --> 00:32:59,287
Sorry, I've been
really sensitive.

95
00:33:02,428 --> 00:33:03,428
Guy?

96
00:34:17,917 --> 00:34:19,057
Guy?

97
00:34:42,287 --> 00:34:44,220
There's a bathroom
right at the entrance.

98
00:34:51,710 --> 00:34:54,402
Guy, are you in there?

99
00:37:58,966 --> 00:38:00,174
Oh, my God.

100
00:38:00,278 --> 00:38:01,486
Guy.

101
00:38:06,870 --> 00:38:07,871
Guy?

102
00:38:39,869 --> 00:38:40,939
Oh, my God.

103
00:38:41,042 --> 00:38:42,078
Oh, my God.

104
00:40:56,419 --> 00:40:57,972
Come on, come on, come on.

105
00:40:58,076 --> 00:40:59,076
Come on.

106
00:41:17,475 --> 00:41:18,614
You.

107
00:41:31,558 --> 00:41:32,697
Come on.

108
00:41:38,530 --> 00:41:39,669
What the fuck?

109
00:42:11,114 --> 00:42:13,013
Come on.

110
00:45:39,081 --> 00:45:40,082
What?

111
00:45:50,920 --> 00:45:52,163
Motherfucker!

112
00:46:41,281 --> 00:46:43,835
I know this place
better than you.

113
00:46:45,803 --> 00:46:49,151
I know every corner
of this house,

114
00:46:49,254 --> 00:46:55,709
every room, every hallway,
the creak of every floorboard.

115
00:46:55,813 --> 00:46:57,469
I know every fucking
lie that's ever

116
00:46:57,573 --> 00:46:58,988
been told inside these walls.

117
00:47:03,890 --> 00:47:05,167
I also know something else.

118
00:47:07,583 --> 00:47:10,793
I'm going to cut that baby
out of your fucking belly.

119
00:47:12,208 --> 00:47:14,866
So let me in this fucking house!

120
00:48:00,015 --> 00:48:02,155
Goddamn doors!

121
00:50:50,633 --> 00:50:51,979
No.

122
00:51:55,112 --> 00:51:56,251
Hello?

123
00:51:59,116 --> 00:52:00,496
Someone's trying to kill me.

124
00:52:03,154 --> 00:52:04,259
Hello?

125
00:52:05,708 --> 00:52:06,708
Yes.

126
00:52:10,057 --> 00:52:14,407
1428 Craven Road.

127
00:52:14,510 --> 00:52:15,201
Craven.

128
00:52:15,304 --> 00:52:16,512
Yeah, yeah.

129
00:52:21,448 --> 00:52:22,622
I think the baby...

130
00:52:22,725 --> 00:52:23,726
it's coming.

131
00:52:26,350 --> 00:52:32,597
Yeah, yeah.

132
00:52:35,082 --> 00:52:36,049
1428.

133
00:52:36,153 --> 00:52:37,809
Yeah.

134
00:52:37,913 --> 00:52:41,123
Okay, okay, yes.

135
00:52:41,227 --> 00:52:45,576
Yeah.

136
01:00:14,507 --> 01:00:18,269
2-44, I have an adult female
in need of medical attention.

137
01:00:18,373 --> 01:00:19,650
Roll EMS.

138
01:00:19,754 --> 01:00:20,686
Hey, hey.

139
01:00:20,789 --> 01:00:22,101
It's okay, it's okay.

140
01:00:22,204 --> 01:00:23,240
Everything is okay.

141
01:00:23,343 --> 01:00:24,310
Just try to breathe.

142
01:00:24,413 --> 01:00:25,760
Subject appears to be in labor.

143
01:00:25,863 --> 01:00:27,002
Requesting backup.

144
01:00:29,246 --> 01:00:30,730
He's out back.

145
01:00:33,526 --> 01:00:34,700
He's out back.

146
01:00:36,805 --> 01:00:38,600
I'm on it.

147
01:00:38,704 --> 01:00:40,533
Hey, hey, hey, okay.

148
01:00:40,637 --> 01:00:41,568
Hey, listen.

149
01:00:41,672 --> 01:00:42,569
What's your name?

150
01:00:42,673 --> 01:00:43,605
Natalie.

151
01:00:43,709 --> 01:00:45,849
Natalie, I'm Paul.

152
01:01:05,938 --> 01:01:07,767
We've got to get
you to my car, okay?

153
01:01:07,871 --> 01:01:09,735
Can you do that for me?

154
01:01:09,838 --> 01:01:11,012
Okay, come on.

155
01:01:18,882 --> 01:01:20,193
Okay, here we go.

156
01:01:20,297 --> 01:01:21,401
Nice and easy.

157
01:01:21,505 --> 01:01:22,505
I got you.

158
01:01:25,164 --> 01:01:26,510
Come on.

159
01:01:26,613 --> 01:01:28,719
2-44, I have no
visual on the suspect.

160
01:01:30,859 --> 01:01:32,067
I'm going in.

161
01:01:34,621 --> 01:01:36,106
You know who did this to you?

162
01:01:43,285 --> 01:01:44,839
Stevens, come in.

163
01:01:46,875 --> 01:01:48,187
Stevens, do you copy?

164
01:01:54,780 --> 01:01:56,333
Look, just stay put.

165
01:01:56,436 --> 01:01:58,516
I've got to go see what's
going on inside, all right?

166
01:02:32,507 --> 01:02:33,508
Stevens!

167
01:02:43,380 --> 01:02:44,277
Adam 244.

168
01:02:44,381 --> 01:02:45,278
Officer down.

169
01:02:45,382 --> 01:02:46,314
9-9-9!

170
01:02:46,417 --> 01:02:48,040
I repeat, officer down.

171
01:02:48,143 --> 01:02:51,284
Suspect is still at large.

172
01:07:18,379 --> 01:07:19,414
Shh.

173
01:07:45,199 --> 01:07:48,685
Shh, shh, shh, shh.

174
01:09:00,964 --> 01:09:01,964
Hey, asshole.

175
01:09:07,971 --> 01:09:10,353
What did you say you were
going to do to me and my baby?

176
01:09:53,810 --> 01:09:54,880
Miss Flores?

177
01:10:01,783 --> 01:10:02,784
Miss Flores?

178
01:10:05,960 --> 01:10:07,720
Where am I?

179
01:10:07,824 --> 01:10:10,033
County hospital.

180
01:10:10,136 --> 01:10:12,898
You have a mild
concussion, and you

181
01:10:13,001 --> 01:10:14,279
lost a fair amount of blood.

182
01:10:16,557 --> 01:10:19,353
You should get some rest.

183
01:10:19,456 --> 01:10:21,493
There's a man
upstairs an officer

184
01:10:21,596 --> 01:10:23,391
would like you to
identify once you've

185
01:10:23,495 --> 01:10:26,360
had some time to recover.

186
01:10:26,463 --> 01:10:27,775
He's alive?

187
01:10:31,848 --> 01:10:34,471
Is there anybody
you'd like us to call?

188
01:10:34,575 --> 01:10:36,577
Any friends? Family?

189
01:10:36,680 --> 01:10:37,680
No.

190
01:10:40,201 --> 01:10:41,375
Where's my son?

191
01:10:44,343 --> 01:10:46,276
Where's my son?

192
01:10:46,380 --> 01:10:50,453
Your son was found unresponsive.

193
01:10:50,556 --> 01:10:53,007
What does that mean?

194
01:10:53,110 --> 01:10:54,284
What does that mean?

195
01:10:54,388 --> 01:10:57,045
He didn't make it.

196
01:11:05,951 --> 01:11:06,952
Miss Flores?

197
01:11:09,092 --> 01:11:10,680
Miss Flores?

198
01:11:10,783 --> 01:11:11,646
What?

199
01:11:11,750 --> 01:11:15,719
Miss Flores, did you hear me?

200
01:11:15,823 --> 01:11:21,207
Your son, he's in ICU,
under observation.

201
01:11:21,311 --> 01:11:22,402
We're doing everything we can.

202
01:11:22,485 --> 01:11:24,487
I want to see him, now.

203
01:12:36,282 --> 01:12:39,803
Sorry, didn't see you.

204
01:13:00,928 --> 01:13:03,482
Miss Flores, can you
confirm that this

205
01:13:03,586 --> 01:13:04,897
is the man that attacked you?

206
01:13:08,970 --> 01:13:13,734
Yeah, that's him.

207
01:13:13,837 --> 01:13:17,185
He escaped a high security
psych ward 72 hours ago.

208
01:13:21,155 --> 01:13:22,156
He burned them off.

209
01:13:24,883 --> 01:13:26,436
Doctors say he
shouldn't be alive.

210
01:13:26,540 --> 01:13:27,851
They can't make sense of it.

211
01:13:31,372 --> 01:13:32,822
Who is he?

212
01:13:32,925 --> 01:13:38,172
Officially, he's an
unidentified John Doe.

213
01:13:38,275 --> 01:13:41,382
But if you ask him, his
name is Gabriel Marquez,

214
01:13:41,486 --> 01:13:45,938
and he was born in
that house in 1929.

215
01:13:46,042 --> 01:13:47,215
That's impossible.

216
01:13:47,319 --> 01:13:48,251
That would mean he's...

217
01:13:48,354 --> 01:13:49,770
He'd be 62 years old.

218
01:13:49,873 --> 01:13:53,532
Yeah, I wouldn't place
him a day over 40 myself.

219
01:13:53,636 --> 01:13:56,362
He's been obsessed with
that place forever.

220
01:13:56,466 --> 01:13:58,330
They caught him squatting
there in the '80s.

221
01:13:58,434 --> 01:14:01,678
So they had him arrested, tried
a few DNA tests over the years,

222
01:14:01,782 --> 01:14:03,887
but nothing came up.

223
01:14:03,991 --> 01:14:05,786
The orderly said
he was acting manic

224
01:14:05,889 --> 01:14:08,340
a few days before the escape,
saying that the house was

225
01:14:08,444 --> 01:14:10,446
calling to him or something.

226
01:14:10,549 --> 01:14:13,172
Apparently, he thinks
that as long as the house

227
01:14:13,276 --> 01:14:16,037
is still standing, so is he.

228
01:14:18,626 --> 01:14:21,767
My guess, he was
on his way there.

229
01:14:23,942 --> 01:14:24,977
He found you.

230
01:14:28,256 --> 01:14:29,948
Could have been anyone.

231
01:14:37,818 --> 01:14:39,178
Let's take you
back to your room.

232
01:14:47,793 --> 01:14:52,315
It's remarkable being in labor
under those circumstances.

233
01:14:52,418 --> 01:14:54,490
I don't know.

234
01:14:54,593 --> 01:14:56,284
It was strange.

235
01:14:56,388 --> 01:14:59,460
Something inside
me just took over.

236
01:14:59,564 --> 01:15:04,948
I just found a way to push.

237
01:15:35,461 --> 01:15:36,601
What is happening?

238
01:15:36,704 --> 01:15:37,533
Hey, everything's okay, ma'am.

239
01:15:37,636 --> 01:15:38,326
-I need to get my baby.
-Ma'am...

240
01:15:38,430 --> 01:15:39,327
I need to get my baby.

241
01:15:39,431 --> 01:15:40,625
Your baby is going to be fine.

242
01:15:40,708 --> 01:15:41,640
-I need to get him...
-Just sit right here, okay?

243
01:15:41,744 --> 01:15:43,424
Someone will come out
and take you outside.

244
01:18:03,748 --> 01:18:04,921
No!
