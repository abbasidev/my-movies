No, no!

Is an ambulance on the way?

61
00:10:11,526 --> 00:10:14,573
No, Alice, this is really
important. You have to call 999.

62
00:10:14,617 --> 00:10:16,401
You have to tell them
exactly where you are

63
00:10:16,444 --> 00:10:18,011
and exactly what happened, okay?

64
00:10:18,055 --> 00:10:20,361
An operator will help you, all right?

65
00:10:20,405 --> 00:10:21,972
I've already called them.

66
00:10:22,015 --> 00:10:24,017
Okay, so an ambulance
is on the way.

67
00:10:24,061 --> 00:10:27,934
Okay. Then why are you not
on the phone with the operator?

68

- You should be talking to them!
- I hung up!

00:10:29,370 --> 00:10:30,981
Oh. You shouldn't have done that.

70

Done what? Can you fucking
tell me what's going on?

71
00:10:33,374 --> 00:10:36,203
Shush! They'll be trying
to call you back.

- No, you need to call them back, Alice.
- Let me talk to her, Mads!

An operator can walk you through

exactly where the ambulance is...

75
00:10:43,515 --> 00:10:46,997

you need to do, and I can't do that.

Why is it still doing
this? Didn't you take it in?

Alice, I can't help anyone if you

Okay, go to her.
Is she responsive?

115
00:12:34,887 --> 00:12:36,671
I can't. Her eyes are open.

Okay, Alice. First we have to
check her airway, okay?

127

I want you to place one hand
very gently on her forehead

128

Place one hand palm down
on her chest

134

and see if it's rising and falling,

135
00:13:25,764 --> 00:13:27,287
and at the same time put your ear

136

very close.

her nose shut, okay?

00:25:27,180 --> 00:25:30,270
I couldn't come home
because you'd be there.

325
00:25:30,314 --> 00:25:34,361
I just needed to be alone!

326
00:25:34,405 --> 00:25:38,714
So I drove into Ashfolk.

327
00:25:38,757 --> 00:25:43,240
My friends and I used to come here
at night when there's no one.

328
00:25:45,372 --> 00:25:47,897
This is where I first met Jakub.

329
00:25:49,463 --> 00:25:51,335
If I'd seen Jakub at the flat,

330
00:25:51,378 --> 00:25:52,902
then I would have had to tell him,

331
00:25:52,945 --> 00:25:54,730
but I didn't know what to say.

332
00:25:54,773 --> 00:25:56,949
Alice. Alice, don't worry
about him, not now.

333
00:25:56,993 --> 00:26:01,606
If I'd told him first instead of you,
then I wouldn't be here!

Alice, what time
did you arrive there?

336
00:26:09,875 --> 00:26:14,706
I'm not sure. Maybe around ten.

337
00:26:14,750 --> 00:26:16,839
Ten? That was over four hours ago.

338
00:26:16,882 --> 00:26:21,452
- I was tired. I fell asleep.
- Christ, Alice! You can't do that!

339
00:26:21,495 --> 00:26:25,325
I had nowhere to go!
And I was so tired.

340
00:26:25,369 --> 00:26:27,893
I woke up and I couldn't find
the main road again.

341
00:26:27,937 --> 00:26:30,722
I got lost. This place is a maze.

342

- I don't believe you.
- What?

343
00:26:32,898 --> 00:26:35,901
I don't believe you drove there
to take a nap.

344
00:26:38,817 --> 00:26:40,602
The police won't either.

345
00:26:42,778 --> 00:26:44,997
- Alice, are you high?
- What? Don't be so ridiculous!

346
00:26:45,041 --> 00:26:47,391
- Alice, tell me.
- Of course she isn't!

347

Frank, last September
Alice called me very upset

348
00:26:49,915 --> 00:26:52,048
because she'd taken some MDMA
with some friends,

349
00:26:52,091 --> 00:26:54,354
and she thought
she was having an overdose.

350
00:26:54,398 --> 00:26:57,314
She was too frightened to go to
the hospital, so she called me.

351
00:26:57,357 --> 00:27:01,666
It turns out she was just having
a panic attack. Isn't that right, Alice?

352
00:27:01,710 --> 00:27:05,496
I... I waited until
it felt safe to drive again.

353
00:27:05,539 --> 00:27:07,367
- Oh, God.
- I didn't feel anything.

354
00:27:07,411 --> 00:27:09,631
- Alice, what have you taken?
- It wasn't a lot...

355
00:27:09,674 --> 00:27:11,894
- I don't understand.
- Everyone at uni did it. I...

356
00:27:11,937 --> 00:27:14,220
- I just needed to feel better.
- Alice. You realize what this means?

357
00:27:14,244 --> 00:27:15,613
It means you were
under the influence.

358
00:27:15,637 --> 00:27:16,899
It wasn't like that.

359
00:27:16,942 --> 00:27:18,465
She just ran out into the road.

360
00:27:18,509 --> 00:27:20,313
Alice, you don't even know
how fast you were going.

361
00:27:20,337 --> 00:27:24,471
The police will... Why hasn't
the ambulance arrived?

362
00:27:24,515 --> 00:27:27,649
Tell me you called them. Please!

363
00:27:30,303 --> 00:27:33,132

- Alice.

364
00:27:33,176 --> 00:27:36,483
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

365
00:27:36,527 --> 00:27:40,444
- Alice, why didn't you call 9-9-9?
- I don't know.

366
00:27:40,487 --> 00:27:44,100
Yes, you do. You called us
because you always call us.

367
00:27:44,143 --> 00:27:46,189
Because we give you
the easy way out.

368
00:27:46,232 --> 00:27:48,017
I needed you to tell me what to do.

369
00:27:48,060 --> 00:27:49,671
Alice, if an ambulance
was never coming,

370
00:27:49,714 --> 00:27:52,369
then the CPR was all for nothing!

371
00:27:52,412 --> 00:27:53,892
How could you not know that?

372
00:27:53,936 --> 00:27:56,242
- I couldn't save her!
- I'm sorry!

373
00:27:56,286 --> 00:27:58,331
The ambulance, they might
have saved her life!

- No, Mom, you're calling the police?

- Will they arrest me?

I can talk to Sophia.

I'll call the police and I'll tell them
exactly what Alice told us,

402
00:29:56,058 --> 00:29:57,842
that she ran out on the road,
into the car,

403
00:29:57,886 --> 00:30:01,498
and there was...
there was nothing I could do.

404
00:30:01,541 --> 00:30:05,241
I'm sober, Mads.
There's no alcohol.

405
00:30:06,590 --> 00:30:08,461
No drugs.

406
00:30:10,202 --> 00:30:11,832
I mean, maybe I was speeding
a little bit.

407
00:30:11,856 --> 00:30:16,295
But the police'll understand that.
It's 3 a.m.

408
00:30:16,339 --> 00:30:22,214
Dark road, no street lights,
and she ran out of the woods.

409
00:30:22,258 --> 00:30:24,521
- They will understand that.
- Frank.

410
00:30:24,564 --> 00:30:26,151
There was nothing I could do
to prevent this.

out of the equation,

412

she was...
she was never even there.

Jesus fucking Christ!

What else can we do? Nothing!

We can't punish her

So if you thought that you
could just drive into Ashfolk,

with your friends,
as you pleased,

652
00:44:41,856 --> 00:44:43,901
and set up camp
where no one could find you,

653
00:44:43,945 --> 00:44:46,687
and get drunk, or high,
or whatever,

654
00:44:46,730 --> 00:44:49,646
then I should remind you
that you are breaking the law

655
00:44:49,690 --> 00:44:51,953

to call the authorities.

ALICE: No, I'm not.
There's no one here.

658
00:44:55,696 --> 00:44:58,089
I just got lost.
Please, I didn't...

- Are you too soused to drive?

00:45:02,746 --> 00:45:04,898
- Is that why you crashed?
- ALICE: Just leave me alone.

to call the authorities?

Alice, Alice.
Put me on the phone with them.

667
00:45:17,718 --> 00:45:20,068
Let me explain to them
what's going on, okay?

She was... She was driving
back to university

679
00:45:48,487 --> 00:45:53,492
and she got lost taking a shortcut
and ended up coming off the road.

680
00:45:53,536 --> 00:45:55,470
And my husband and I,
we're driving into Ashfolk now.

681

We really appreciate you stopping
to check on Alice as you did.

We're just a... just a...

from here on.

Well, as I said,
we're only a few minutes away.

in the woods?

- In the woods?

691

You came bounding out of there
all flustered.

- Excuse me. Excuse me, please!

Look, I'm sorry, but I can hear

694
00:46:54,771 --> 00:46:56,729
that you're making Alice
really uncomfortable.

695
00:46:56,773 --> 00:46:59,384
I mean no disrespect, but
the fact that you're strangers

696
00:46:59,428 --> 00:47:02,561
driving around a forest late at night
makes me uncomfortable, okay?

697

It's very disconcerting, okay?

698
00:47:04,607 --> 00:47:08,176

would really appreciate it

just got on your way

- No.

- Alice? Is that... Is that Alice?

- WOMAN: Quiet now.
- Please, please put her on the phone!

813
00:53:17,980 --> 00:53:20,809
- Shush. Stay in the car. Stay in the car.
- Don't hurt her!

run away with you.

- But I suppose we all create stories.
- There isn't a story.

816

The girl ran... ran
in front of the car in the dark.

This wasn't Alice's fault.
She did everything she could to save her.

That... That's...
That's the truth.

819
00:53:38,696 --> 00:53:41,438
That doesn't explain
why she's here.

820
00:53:41,482 --> 00:53:44,833
Driving while intoxicated.

821
00:53:44,876 --> 00:53:49,664

- A better story.

Mm-hm.

You... You understand that?

827
00:54:06,898 --> 00:54:11,076
All Alice did, all she did
was... was drive into the woods

828
00:54:11,120 --> 00:54:12,600
to escape a stressful situation.

829
00:54:12,643 --> 00:54:15,559
It was me... I was the one

830
00:54:15,603 --> 00:54:17,779
who... who told her to hide the body

831
00:54:17,822 --> 00:54:20,869
because I didn't want anyone
to find out until we got there.

832
00:54:20,912 --> 00:54:26,309
My... My wife was then to drive her home
and I was to stay and take the blame.

833
00:54:26,353 --> 00:54:32,272
But I... I promise you we were...
we weren't going to run.

not Alice.

835

No parent wants to be
their child's monster.

Nobody wants to tell them no.

839

And then they grow up
and it's too late.

840
00:55:01,213 --> 00:55:04,652
My husband and I
learned that the hard way.

841

Are you okay?

ALICE: I don't understand.
How can she still be alive?

852
00:55:49,218 --> 00:55:51,351
Alice, you were so terrified
that you'd killed her,

853
00:55:51,394 --> 00:55:53,788
you convinced yourself it was true.

854
00:55:53,831 --> 00:55:59,359
But the most important thing is she's...
she's... she's gonna be okay.

855
00:56:01,317 --> 00:56:03,711
Mom?

856
00:56:03,754 --> 00:56:06,714
I don't know. Maybe...
Maybe we missed her heartbeat.

857
00:56:06,757 --> 00:56:08,933
But I felt her chest collapse.

858
00:56:08,977 --> 00:56:12,023
- Alice, you saved her life.
- If I'd called an ambulance...

859
00:56:12,067 --> 00:56:15,549
She's gonna be okay.
And... And you're gonna be okay.

860
00:56:15,592 --> 00:56:17,396
And the woman will still let us
go along with the plan

861

to say that I was
the one driving, all right?

862
00:56:19,161 --> 00:56:22,643
Nothing will change. Okay?

863
00:56:24,471 --> 00:56:26,864
It has to be your decision, Alice.

864
00:56:26,908 --> 00:56:29,408
- No, the decision's been made.
- No. Frank, we can't make it for her.

865
00:56:29,432 --> 00:56:34,263
Why can't...
Why can't you let this work?

866
00:56:34,306 --> 00:56:38,354
Cos I know what happens if you
don't face what you've done.

867
00:56:38,398 --> 00:56:41,531
It breaks you down.
Every part of you.

868
00:56:43,881 --> 00:56:46,406
I had to quit being a paramedic.

869
00:56:48,364 --> 00:56:50,845
What do you mean?

870
00:56:54,501 --> 00:56:57,895
I'd been ignoring
the warning signs for a while.

871
00:56:57,939 --> 00:57:02,073
You know, the alarm bells telling me
that I couldn't do it any more.

872
00:57:02,117 --> 00:57:06,295
Then I was called out to a woman
my age, in a shopping centre.

873
00:57:06,338 --> 00:57:09,559
And when we arrived at the scene,
I could see that she was having a panic attack.

874
00:57:09,603 --> 00:57:12,736
And she presented exactly
as I would have expected.

875
00:57:12,780 --> 00:57:16,348
Difficulty breathing, cramping fingers,
wide, staring eyes.

876
00:57:16,392 --> 00:57:19,656
We get these cases all the time.
I'm good at them.

877
00:57:19,700 --> 00:57:23,051
I can always talk someone
through a panic attack.

878
00:57:23,094 --> 00:57:26,010
And my colleague said, "I think
we should take her to hospital."

879
00:57:26,054 --> 00:57:29,318
And I said, "No, she'll be fine
in a minute."

880
00:57:29,361 --> 00:57:34,454
And then she wasn't, and I couldn't
get her to regulate her breathing,

881
00:57:34,497 --> 00:57:40,808
so we had to move, and in the ambulance
she went into cardiac arrest.

882
00:57:40,851 --> 00:57:44,681
And I did CPR,
but I couldn't bring her back.

883
00:57:44,725 --> 00:57:47,379
And when we got to the hospital,
the A&E doctor in charge

884
00:57:47,423 --> 00:57:51,471
told me that she'd had
a massive pulmonary embolism.

885
00:57:51,514 --> 00:57:55,083
She'd had multiple clots
on her lungs.

886
00:57:55,126 --> 00:57:58,390
And I'd missed it. I'd asked
all the wrong questions.

887
00:57:58,434 --> 00:58:03,395
And I... I was so sure
about what I was looking at,

888
00:58:03,439 --> 00:58:07,878
I was so sure it was a panic
attack that I'd missed it.

889
00:58:18,889 --> 00:58:23,111
And... And nobody blamed me.

890
00:58:23,154 --> 00:58:26,636
It was considered
an understandable mistake.

891
00:58:32,294 --> 00:58:34,644
So I handed in my resignation.

892
00:58:41,303 --> 00:58:43,697
So, Alice, it has to be
your decision, sweetheart.

893
00:58:43,740 --> 00:58:48,049
It can't... Dad and I can't
make it for you, all right?

894
00:58:54,272 --> 00:58:57,145
ALICE: I left her there.

895
00:58:57,188 --> 00:58:59,669

896
00:59:01,410 --> 00:59:04,848

Yeah...

898
00:59:06,720 --> 00:59:10,637

then I want to say sorry.

00:59:15,729 --> 00:59:17,382
Okay.

before it's too late.

- We're close. A couple of minutes.

- Alice, I'm here. I'm here.

<i>(ALICE WHIMPERS)</i>

974
01:05:52,560 --> 01:05:56,956

We're here to help.

They can't be far.

ALICE: Why are we still here?
Are we going to the hospital?

980
01:06:19,979 --> 01:06:23,330
To the police? Is the girl okay?

981
01:06:24,853 --> 01:06:28,422
WOMAN: No. She's dead, Alice.

982
01:06:29,423 --> 01:06:31,512
You killed her.

983
01:06:31,555 --> 01:06:34,558
You left her to freeze
in the woods on Hallow Road.

984
01:06:34,602 --> 01:06:39,215
- ALICE: I don't... I don't understand.
- Yes, you do.

985
01:06:39,259 --> 01:06:42,349
You knew she was dead
when you ran her down.

986
01:06:42,392 --> 01:06:45,352
And you knew that was the end
of your own life,

987
01:06:45,395 --> 01:06:49,573
your promising future, that nothing
would ever be the same again.

988

- You knew what you'd done.
- ALICE: No. <i>(SOBS)</i>

989
01:06:52,663 --> 01:06:57,973
- I want my parents. Where are they?

ALICE: No! You're not my parents!

- Oh, but we are now.

Oh, my God!

from this awful,
evil thing you've done.

- ALICE: What is this?
- Oh, Jesus Christ.

997
01:07:17,732 --> 01:07:22,171
WOMAN: No parent wants to be
their child's monster, Alice.

998
01:07:22,215 --> 01:07:26,610
They can't face what needs to
be done. But we can, Alice.

And we're here for you now.

1000
01:07:29,831 --> 01:07:33,182
As we were here
for the child before you.

1001
01:07:33,226 --> 01:07:35,967
And the child before her.

ALICE: Mom!

1008
01:08:00,775 --> 01:08:03,473
WOMAN: A parent's base instinct
is to believe

1009
01:08:03,517 --> 01:08:07,173
that they can spare their child
from life's consequences.

1010
01:08:07,216 --> 01:08:10,219
That they can save you,
no matter the cost.

1011
01:08:10,263 --> 01:08:13,396
- So they make up stories.
- Is that them?

1012
01:08:17,922 --> 01:08:20,316
That's why you're on this path.

1013
01:08:20,360 --> 01:08:25,843
ALICE: I don't want to be here!
What is this? Where am I, please?

1014
01:08:25,887 --> 01:08:28,063
WOMAN: How far do you think
they'll go for you, Alice?

1015
01:08:28,107 --> 01:08:29,934
How long do you think
they'll keep driving?

01:08:29,978 --> 01:08:32,415
ALICE: No, no, no. Please,
please, what are you doing?

their story has no resolution?

Where are you taking me?

No, I need to fix this. Please,

Initial impressions, the girl was wasted.
Crashed the car in a ditch.

Stepped in the middle of the road,

someone ran her over in the dark.

fled the scene.

the body of their real daughter.
