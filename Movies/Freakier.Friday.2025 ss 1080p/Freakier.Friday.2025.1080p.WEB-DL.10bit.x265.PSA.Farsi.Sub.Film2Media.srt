00:00:45,416 --> 00:00:47,500
Pink Slip! Pink Slip!

2
00:00:47,583 --> 00:00:49,875
Pink Slip! Pink Slip!

3
00:00:49,958 --> 00:00:51,541
Pink Slip! Pink Slip!

00:01:10,958 --> 00:01:12,083
<i>Text from Mom:</i>

00:01:12,166 --> 00:01:14,333
<i>"Hi, honey. I noticed</i>
<i>you haven't chimed in</i>

6
00:01:14,416 --> 00:01:15,250

00:01:15,333 --> 00:01:17,708
<i>Text from Mom:</i>

<i>Text from Mom:</i>

00:01:18,875 --> 00:01:20,291
<i>"I'm just about to</i>

10
00:01:21,708 --> 00:01:23,000
Hi. Welcome back.

11
00:01:23,083 --> 00:01:24,875
I'm Dr. Tess Coleman,

12
00:01:24,958 --> 00:01:27,583
and this is
<i>Rebelling with Respect</i>.

13
00:01:27,666 --> 00:01:29,416
Today on the podcast,

14
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:32,125
we are talking
about a relationship dynamic

15
00:01:32,208 --> 00:01:34,375
that is very close
to my heart.

16
00:01:34,458 --> 00:01:36,833
"Grand co-parenting."

17
00:01:36,916 --> 00:01:39,958
When my daughter, Anna,
chose to become a single mom,

18
00:01:40,041 --> 00:01:41,625
it changed our family forever.

19
00:01:43,458 --> 00:01:45,916
Ryan! Cloffice. Recording.

20
00:01:47,625 --> 00:01:49,333
Sorry!

21
00:01:49,416 --> 00:01:53,916
As a grandma, I was
able to step up and help her.

22
00:01:58,333 --> 00:02:01,000
Harper!

23
00:02:01,875 --> 00:02:03,833
Harper, this is
your 30-minute warning

24
00:02:03,916 --> 00:02:05,500
that we're leaving for school.

25
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:07,750
Harp?

26
00:02:08,541 --> 00:02:10,000
This is now
your 20-minute warning.

27
00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:12,000
Ten minutes.

28
00:02:12,083 --> 00:02:13,666
Yes, confirm
the recording sessions.

29
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:16,625
But know that I know she can
sell out more than the Greek.

30
00:02:16,708 --> 00:02:18,333
And yes, I know
how many seats there are.

31
00:02:19,375 --> 00:02:21,333
Harper! I really wanna
respect your space,

32
00:02:21,416 --> 00:02:23,750
but I'm curious as to why
you're not out here yet.

33
00:02:23,833 --> 00:02:24,791
You have five minutes!

34
00:02:24,875 --> 00:02:27,875
<i>Being someone that</i>
<i>your loved one can lean on</i>

35
00:02:27,958 --> 00:02:31,000
is the most important
relationship there is.

36
00:02:34,541 --> 00:02:37,583
Ryan,
I'm getting so good at this!

37
00:02:40,041 --> 00:02:41,208
No.

38
00:02:42,833 --> 00:02:43,916
No, no, no!

39
00:02:44,458 --> 00:02:46,708
{\an8}Oh, it didn't record!

40
00:02:46,791 --> 00:02:48,375
{\an8}Moth--

41
00:02:48,458 --> 00:02:49,708
Hi, Mom.

42
00:02:49,791 --> 00:02:51,166
Now is not a great time.
I'm just...

43
00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:53,000
<i>I know, but I finished</i>
<i>my podcast early,</i>

44
00:02:53,083 --> 00:02:54,875
<i>so I'm offering</i>
<i>to do drop-off.</i>

45
00:02:54,958 --> 00:02:57,375
No. It's okay. I've got
everything under control.

46
00:02:57,916 --> 00:02:59,625
Harper, you had to be up
ten minutes ago!

47
00:02:59,708 --> 00:03:00,958
Prepare to be triggered!

48
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:08,500
Harper!

49
00:03:21,333 --> 00:03:23,166
Let's catch one more.

50
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:25,291
Dude,
these waves are unreal.

51
00:03:25,375 --> 00:03:27,625
I love our lives!

52
00:03:27,708 --> 00:03:29,541
Yo, are we skipping
first period?

53
00:03:29,625 --> 00:03:31,125
Oh, shoot. We gotta go.

54
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:40,541
- Harper!
- What?

55
00:03:41,416 --> 00:03:42,625
I'm literally ready.

56
00:03:42,708 --> 00:03:44,333
Barely. Barely.

57
00:03:44,416 --> 00:03:46,083
I made your favorite lunch.

58
00:03:46,708 --> 00:03:48,958
How was pickleball yesterday?
Did you beat 'em?

59
00:03:49,041 --> 00:03:52,000
We say "annihilated."

60
00:03:52,083 --> 00:03:54,000
Mom, I told you
I could take her.

61
00:03:54,083 --> 00:03:55,083
I know, sweetheart.

62
00:03:55,166 --> 00:03:56,666
But I saw on your stories

63
00:03:56,750 --> 00:03:58,416
that you were working
at the studio late,

64
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:00,166
and so I decided to take her.

65
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:02,375
You know, it would be healthy
for you to unfollow me.

66
00:04:02,458 --> 00:04:04,583
And I work late all the time.
I can still take her.

67
00:04:04,666 --> 00:04:07,166
Anna, let's pause and reframe.

68
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:09,208
When you decided
to be a single mom,

69
00:04:09,291 --> 00:04:11,375
I told you I would support you
a hundred percent.

70
00:04:11,458 --> 00:04:13,958
Well, this is me supporting
you a hundred percent.

71
00:04:14,041 --> 00:04:15,500
Okay, you know what?

72
00:04:15,583 --> 00:04:16,416
I'm coming too.

73
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:17,666
We can both do drop-off
this morning.

74
00:04:18,416 --> 00:04:20,708
- Mom.
- No, go on. You can go.

75
00:04:20,791 --> 00:04:22,416
- Just let them...
- Oh, okay, you're not going.

76
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:24,625
- Mom.
- You're gonna go.

77
00:04:24,708 --> 00:04:26,166
You're not...
Nobody's gonna go.

78
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:27,500
I'm gonna go!

79
00:04:28,416 --> 00:04:30,250
- So what's up, kiddo?
- Nothing.

80
00:04:31,166 --> 00:04:32,708
- Okay, spill it.
- All right.

81
00:04:32,791 --> 00:04:35,041
My new lab partner
is the absolute worst.

82
00:04:35,125 --> 00:04:36,958
<i>She's the new girl,</i>
<i>here for the year.</i>

83
00:04:37,041 --> 00:04:38,333
<i>I mean, ugh,</i>

84
00:04:38,416 --> 00:04:39,916
<i>she thinks</i>
<i>she's so much better</i>

85
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,166
<i>than everyone</i>
<i>because she's British,</i>

86
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:45,083
which she has to remind you of
every five seconds.

87
00:04:45,166 --> 00:04:47,208
Like no one's ever been
from England before.

88
00:04:47,291 --> 00:04:49,375
So my dad opened
his third restaurant in Paris,

89
00:04:49,458 --> 00:04:51,166
and that's how I met
my French boyfriend,

90
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:52,250
Philippe Henri.

91
00:04:52,333 --> 00:04:55,000
- Philippe Henri.
- Ooh, la-la.

92
00:04:55,083 --> 00:04:56,500
He's French and a model.

93
00:04:56,583 --> 00:04:58,500
You've seriously been
to Paris Fashion Week?

94
00:04:58,583 --> 00:04:59,916
Anna Wintour scowled at me.

95
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,833
- Seriously?
- What's Paris like?

96
00:05:01,916 --> 00:05:03,875
Oh, it's lovely.
I go all the time.

97
00:05:03,958 --> 00:05:05,791
Ignore the British girl.

98
00:05:05,875 --> 00:05:08,625
After this year, you won't
have to see her anymore.

99
00:05:08,708 --> 00:05:10,500
Nice advice from a therapist.

100
00:05:10,583 --> 00:05:12,583
Well, I'm not her therapist.
I'm her Gram.

101
00:05:12,666 --> 00:05:13,958
All right, well,
this has been real.

102
00:05:14,041 --> 00:05:15,666
Please drive away
like you don't know me.

103
00:05:16,541 --> 00:05:17,541
Make good choices!

104
00:05:17,625 --> 00:05:19,708
You are so lame.

105
00:05:19,791 --> 00:05:20,625
Lame!

106
00:05:21,166 --> 00:05:23,583
Are you
ready for laboratory today?

107
00:05:23,666 --> 00:05:24,916
Shut your mouth.

108
00:05:26,208 --> 00:05:28,250
Fun bonus round today.

109
00:05:28,333 --> 00:05:30,416
Never trust an atom. Why?

110
00:05:32,583 --> 00:05:34,291
'Cause they make up
everything.

111
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,250
Here all day, folks.

112
00:05:36,333 --> 00:05:37,750
You're supposed to
put your goggles on

113
00:05:37,833 --> 00:05:39,041
before we start.

114
00:05:40,041 --> 00:05:41,708
The goggles are giving Minion.

115
00:05:41,791 --> 00:05:43,541
Yeah. We're not,
like, Minions.

116
00:05:44,333 --> 00:05:46,916
So, no, thank you.
But they're perfect for you.

117
00:05:47,916 --> 00:05:49,625
It's like
the Revolutionary War

118
00:05:49,708 --> 00:05:50,541
was for nothing.

119
00:05:51,333 --> 00:05:55,083
Today, remember,
these are dangerous chemicals.

120
00:05:55,166 --> 00:05:56,750
Maybe we should use
not-dangerous chemicals?

121
00:05:56,833 --> 00:05:58,375
How about you do
your actual share of the work

122
00:05:58,458 --> 00:05:59,541
instead of doodling?

123
00:05:59,625 --> 00:06:00,833
It's called designing.

124
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:03,083
The measurements
have to be precise.

125
00:06:03,958 --> 00:06:05,500
This experiment is so simple.

126
00:06:05,583 --> 00:06:07,541
In the UK,
we did this in primary school.

127
00:06:08,666 --> 00:06:10,416
The only reason
people think you're smart

128
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:12,708
is because of
your obnoxious accent.

129
00:06:12,791 --> 00:06:15,208
At least people think
I'm clever.

130
00:06:15,291 --> 00:06:16,750
What's that supposed to mean?

131
00:06:16,833 --> 00:06:18,500
You're smart. Figure it out.

132
00:06:20,791 --> 00:06:21,958
- Oh, no.
- Oh, no.

133
00:06:22,041 --> 00:06:23,208
- Oh, no.
- Oh, no.

134
00:06:23,291 --> 00:06:24,500
Oh, no.

135
00:06:25,291 --> 00:06:26,291
Oh!

136
00:06:27,208 --> 00:06:30,000
- That was not precise!
- That's not precise at all!

137
00:06:31,416 --> 00:06:33,583
Oh. Principal Waldman!

138
00:06:33,666 --> 00:06:35,083
I don't know, Mom.
I don't know why

139
00:06:35,166 --> 00:06:36,458
the principal called me,
but I'm here.

140
00:06:36,541 --> 00:06:38,083
So you don't need to come.
You know what?

141
00:06:38,166 --> 00:06:39,500
I can't find what I was gonna
tell you about.

142
00:06:39,583 --> 00:06:41,416
I'll call you...

143
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:43,041
- Sorry.
- It's totally my fault.

144
00:06:43,125 --> 00:06:45,375
No, no, no. I-I wasn't
looking where I was going.

145
00:06:45,458 --> 00:06:46,333
Oh.

146
00:06:53,250 --> 00:06:54,875
Are you okay?

147
00:06:56,333 --> 00:06:58,125
- Your phone.
- Yeah, I...

148
00:06:58,208 --> 00:07:00,500
Yeah, I don't know
how to turn this thing off.

149
00:07:00,583 --> 00:07:02,375
Yeah, I'm not sure, either.
I think, maybe...

150
00:07:02,458 --> 00:07:03,625
- I think you got it.
- Is it off?

151
00:07:03,708 --> 00:07:05,291
- Yeah. It's just...
- Oh, thank you.

152
00:07:05,375 --> 00:07:06,791
- No problem.
- Thank you.

153
00:07:08,041 --> 00:07:10,500
Um, my daughter
just started here,

154
00:07:10,583 --> 00:07:12,166
and I admit I'm quite lost.

155
00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:14,083
Would you happen to know
where the chemistry lab is?

156
00:07:14,166 --> 00:07:16,833
This is serious. Someone
could have been injured.

157
00:07:16,916 --> 00:07:18,541
I'm sure it was just
an accident.

158
00:07:19,291 --> 00:07:21,291
It seems to me
a misunderstanding.

159
00:07:21,375 --> 00:07:23,958
Harper seems so...

160
00:07:24,916 --> 00:07:25,916
lovely.

161
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:30,250
Oh. Well, Lily seems so genuine and kind.

162
00:07:32,166 --> 00:07:35,208
Wow. I certainly never had two parents

163
00:07:35,291 --> 00:07:36,916
come in here and be this attractive.

164
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,583
I meant "attentive."

165
00:07:38,666 --> 00:07:39,916
Oh.

166
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,541
Uh, Lily and I are
definitely going to reflect

167
00:07:42,625 --> 00:07:44,583
on how to do better.

168
00:07:44,666 --> 00:07:48,083
This is all Harper and I
are going to think about.

169
00:07:48,166 --> 00:07:50,916
We're very, very committed.

170
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:55,083
Especially as a single-parent household.

171
00:07:55,166 --> 00:07:56,416
Oh, us too.

172
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:57,833
- We're single. Parent.
- Great.

173
00:07:57,916 --> 00:07:58,916
I mean, uh...

174
00:07:59,583 --> 00:08:02,000
- I'm a single parent, yeah.
- Single parent. Great.

175
00:08:02,083 --> 00:08:03,708
- Yeah. You know what I mean.
- Yes. Same. Me too.

176
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:05,583
Single.

177
00:08:05,666 --> 00:08:07,083
Single parent. Guilty.

178
00:08:07,166 --> 00:08:08,166
Great.

179
00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:09,583
I'm single too.

180
00:08:09,666 --> 00:08:11,250
Oh, my God... Should we meet up?

181
00:08:11,333 --> 00:08:13,583
Perhaps our daughters
should get to know each other?

182
00:08:13,666 --> 00:08:16,166
Maybe, like, Wednesdays,
after 6:00. Get a little wine?

183
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:18,000
Talk about these badass kids?

184
00:08:18,083 --> 00:08:19,666
Harper would really like that.

185
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:21,000
Over dinner?

186
00:08:21,083 --> 00:08:22,458
Dinner sounds perfect.

187
00:08:22,541 --> 00:08:23,541
I'm on it.

188
00:08:24,958 --> 00:08:28,375
<i>Petit Trois</i>? Yes,
can I have a table for two?

189
00:08:28,458 --> 00:08:30,833
Private. In the back.

190
00:08:30,916 --> 00:08:32,375
Do you guys have any allergies?

191
00:08:32,458 --> 00:08:33,625
- No.
- No.

192
00:08:33,708 --> 00:08:34,875
No. No allergies.

193
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:26,958
Okay, you came here early.
Spill it.

194
00:09:27,041 --> 00:09:28,458
There's just no time.

195
00:09:28,541 --> 00:09:30,333
Bachelorette party, dance rehearsal,

196
00:09:30,416 --> 00:09:32,166
final fitting, rehearsal lunch.

197
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:33,791
And, oh, my wedding.

198
00:09:33,875 --> 00:09:37,041
You have a lot on your plate.
Big day. Deep breath.

199
00:09:37,125 --> 00:09:38,708
There's so much to do
before Sunday.

200
00:09:38,791 --> 00:09:39,708
Anna, let us know
how we can help.

201
00:09:39,791 --> 00:09:41,916
Maybe someone could help me
memorize my wedding vows.

202
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,375
How about this? I'll help you.

203
00:09:43,458 --> 00:09:45,458
"I, Anna, take you, Eric,

204
00:09:45,541 --> 00:09:48,208
a man that I have been dating
for six months,

205
00:09:48,291 --> 00:09:50,166
but might uproot
my entire life

206
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:51,125
and move to London,

207
00:09:51,208 --> 00:09:55,083
where we have no family
and an avocado costs $11."

208
00:09:55,166 --> 00:09:57,041
Perhaps you should
add something about

209
00:09:57,125 --> 00:09:59,958
my undying patience
for teenage rebellion.

210
00:10:00,041 --> 00:10:01,083
Spot on about the avocado.

211
00:10:01,166 --> 00:10:02,833
Oh. That wasn't about you.

212
00:10:02,916 --> 00:10:05,333
It was actually about my mom's
other British fiancé.

213
00:10:05,416 --> 00:10:06,458
She's a comedian today.

214
00:10:06,541 --> 00:10:07,916
- Just today, though.
- I see. Yeah.

215
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,083
Right, Harper?

216
00:10:09,166 --> 00:10:10,583
I have been practicing
our first dance.

217
00:10:10,666 --> 00:10:12,166
Wait till you see
what I have cooking.

218
00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:14,375
Ooh, I see what you did there.

219
00:10:14,458 --> 00:10:16,291
I missed you since yesterday.

220
00:10:16,375 --> 00:10:18,208
Ew.

221
00:10:18,291 --> 00:10:20,875
<i>Trevor Travis</i>
<i>just dropped a new single.</i>

222
00:10:20,958 --> 00:10:22,791
<i>I think we can all guess</i>
<i>who it might be about.</i>

223
00:10:24,250 --> 00:10:25,250
Hello?

224
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:30,458
I had my pastry chef make
sticky toffee pudding pavlova

225
00:10:30,541 --> 00:10:31,375
for the bake sale.

226
00:10:31,458 --> 00:10:34,500
Just what
every teenager loves. Pavlova.

227
00:10:34,583 --> 00:10:37,166
Agreed. Teenagers these days,
sophisticated palates.

228
00:10:37,250 --> 00:10:41,291
Yes, well, this pastry chef
was up at 4:00 a.m.

229
00:10:41,375 --> 00:10:43,208
baking old-fashioned
chocolate chip cookies

230
00:10:43,291 --> 00:10:45,000
from scratch, with no staff.

231
00:10:45,083 --> 00:10:47,625
Four hours for cookies?

232
00:10:47,708 --> 00:10:49,291
I think we need to
get you a staff.

233
00:10:51,166 --> 00:10:52,875
They just needed to cool.

234
00:10:52,958 --> 00:10:54,333
Stand up straight.
Good posture.

235
00:10:54,416 --> 00:10:55,875
Okay. And do you know
how bad this is for you?

236
00:10:55,958 --> 00:10:57,791
Seriously, eat this.

237
00:10:57,875 --> 00:10:59,833
Say, "Thanks, Mom."

238
00:10:59,916 --> 00:11:00,916
I saw that, Harper.

239
00:11:02,083 --> 00:11:03,375
Any day now.

240
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:06,416
Just trying to keep us
on a schedule here.

241
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:07,500
Oi. Well,

242
00:11:07,583 --> 00:11:10,041
we wouldn't want
to be off schedule, innit?

243
00:11:10,125 --> 00:11:11,166
Step, and...

244
00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:12,416
Hi, Lil!

245
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:13,541
It's Lily.

246
00:11:13,625 --> 00:11:15,041
Lily, back seat.

247
00:11:15,833 --> 00:11:17,125
Can't Grams just take me?

248
00:11:17,208 --> 00:11:19,041
No, this will be good bonding
for everyone.

249
00:11:19,625 --> 00:11:21,666
Well, I bond best with Lily

250
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:22,833
when we're
not around each other,

251
00:11:22,916 --> 00:11:25,041
and I don't have to
look at her face.

252
00:11:25,125 --> 00:11:26,916
Yeah,
I love sitting next to you.

253
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,416
Reminds me that I'm amazing.

254
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:29,583
Seat belts, girls.

255
00:11:37,166 --> 00:11:38,625
All right. All right.

256
00:11:38,708 --> 00:11:39,958
- I got you.
- You got me.

257
00:11:40,041 --> 00:11:41,041
- Good morning.
- We're ready to go.

258
00:11:41,125 --> 00:11:44,250
Good morning. Car's all set.
Up the coast, Route 1?

259
00:11:44,333 --> 00:11:46,958
- Yeah?
- Yeah? What do you think?

260
00:11:47,041 --> 00:11:50,083
{\an8}I'm not saying I don't
not want to go on the trip.

261
00:11:50,166 --> 00:11:53,333
I'm just saying
that Anna's wedding

262
00:11:53,416 --> 00:11:55,166
has put me behind
with my patients,

263
00:11:55,250 --> 00:11:57,250
which has been
very disruptive.

264
00:11:57,333 --> 00:11:59,750
- Uh-huh.
- And... And, of course,

265
00:12:00,333 --> 00:12:03,208
they keep adding dates
to my book tour,

266
00:12:03,291 --> 00:12:05,333
which, you know,
it's out of my control.

267
00:12:05,958 --> 00:12:07,541
And I'm just saying
I need a little time.

268
00:12:07,625 --> 00:12:08,916
Look, girls.

269
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,458
We're trying to hear you.
Just try and hear us?

270
00:12:11,541 --> 00:12:12,416
Oh, no.

271
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:14,125
I hear you trying
to pull me away

272
00:12:14,208 --> 00:12:16,791
from my family and my friends.

273
00:12:16,875 --> 00:12:19,416
I mean, who even gets to surf
before school in London?

274
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:21,708
You can surf
on the river Thames.

275
00:12:21,791 --> 00:12:23,250
Really?

276
00:12:23,333 --> 00:12:24,583
No, you dipstick.

277
00:12:24,666 --> 00:12:26,000
- Girls.
- It's a city.

278
00:12:26,083 --> 00:12:27,250
- You need to--
- Okay, girls. Girls.

279
00:12:27,333 --> 00:12:28,333
It's our decision.

280
00:12:28,875 --> 00:12:31,041
Eric and I will do
what's right for the family.

281
00:12:31,125 --> 00:12:32,541
- Hmm.
- Family?

282
00:12:32,625 --> 00:12:33,833
Yes, this family.

283
00:12:33,916 --> 00:12:35,208
- Don't say it like that.
- Don't say--

284
00:12:35,291 --> 00:12:36,583
- That sounds really cringe.
- Don't tell me

285
00:12:36,666 --> 00:12:38,041
what to say and how to say.

286
00:12:38,125 --> 00:12:39,541
Harper, relax.
Don't be so dramatic.

287
00:12:39,625 --> 00:12:40,750
Lily.

288
00:12:40,833 --> 00:12:42,541
- Stop gaslighting.
- What?

289
00:12:42,625 --> 00:12:44,958
You don't even know
what that means.

290
00:12:45,041 --> 00:12:46,125
I don't wanna
look at your face anymore.

291
00:12:46,208 --> 00:12:47,291
You know
what that means, right?

292
00:12:47,375 --> 00:12:49,208
- I think I know what it means.
- Yeah. I knew you did.

293
00:12:49,291 --> 00:12:51,333
That explains why
you talk rubbish.

294
00:12:51,416 --> 00:12:54,333
<i> For the bake sale,</i>
<i>every table must have...</i>

295
00:12:54,416 --> 00:12:55,416
Okay.

296
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:57,083
<i>...a gluten-free option,</i>
<i>an egg-free option...</i>

297
00:12:57,166 --> 00:12:58,708
Please don't slam the...

298
00:13:00,291 --> 00:13:01,416
door.

299
00:13:02,250 --> 00:13:04,125
Well, at least
we don't have to bring them

300
00:13:04,208 --> 00:13:05,916
to our immigration interview
tomorrow.

301
00:13:06,708 --> 00:13:09,041
Don't be stressed.
They'll come round.

302
00:13:10,041 --> 00:13:12,125
Yeah, let them take
all the time they need.

303
00:13:16,458 --> 00:13:17,916
He sounds great.
I'll be back in a bit.

304
00:13:18,750 --> 00:13:20,458
- Here's Ella's schedule.
- Thank you.

305
00:13:21,250 --> 00:13:22,791
Oh, send those
to the tour manager, please.

306
00:13:22,875 --> 00:13:25,041
- Yeah, okay.
- Okay? Because I'm...

307
00:13:25,125 --> 00:13:26,958
- I'm a pop star on the rise.
- Okay.

308
00:13:27,041 --> 00:13:28,500
So I wanna
do the album, you know.

309
00:13:28,583 --> 00:13:29,791
We can come in here
after midnight.

310
00:13:29,875 --> 00:13:31,375
I got the keys to the studio.

311
00:13:31,458 --> 00:13:33,416
- How's it going?
- Oh, good morning.

312
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:35,458
Actually, it's literally not.
It's a bad morning.

313
00:13:35,541 --> 00:13:36,791
It's a very bad morning.

314
00:13:36,875 --> 00:13:38,500
Not for me,
personally, but for you.

315
00:13:38,583 --> 00:13:40,125
Why, what happened?

316
00:13:40,208 --> 00:13:41,666
Trevor dumped Ella.

317
00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:43,458
And he already released
a song about it.

318
00:13:43,541 --> 00:13:46,208
<i>- Anna!</i>
- Oh.

319
00:13:46,291 --> 00:13:47,958
Yeah, and he dumped her
in a text.

320
00:13:48,041 --> 00:13:49,708
- Yeah, I got this.
- Toxic icon.

321
00:13:50,583 --> 00:13:52,875
I'll get in the booth, and
I'ma just lay it all down...

322
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:55,250
Okay, so Trevor wrote a song.

323
00:13:55,333 --> 00:13:57,291
But I'm sure
it's not as bad as you think.

324
00:13:57,375 --> 00:13:58,875
It's called
"Better Than the Last One."

325
00:13:58,958 --> 00:14:00,083
It's about me.

326
00:14:00,166 --> 00:14:03,083
Okay, but that title,
it could be about anyone.

327
00:14:03,166 --> 00:14:05,458
It says, parentheses, "Ella."

328
00:14:05,541 --> 00:14:06,958
Let's just focus on the songs

329
00:14:07,041 --> 00:14:08,791
that you're gonna perform
on Saturday.

330
00:14:08,875 --> 00:14:10,166
Performing! Yay!

331
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:14,708
I can't sing those songs.
I wrote them about Trevor.

332
00:14:14,791 --> 00:14:16,958
I put my heart
and soul into them.

333
00:14:17,041 --> 00:14:20,333
No, a 44-year-old Dutch music
producer wrote those songs.

334
00:14:21,291 --> 00:14:23,208
♪ <i>She's nothing like my ex </i>♪

335
00:14:23,291 --> 00:14:25,041
This is a hit! This is...

336
00:14:25,125 --> 00:14:26,666
I can't even
stop moving my body.

337
00:14:26,750 --> 00:14:27,750
- Shh!
- Look, my chest

338
00:14:27,833 --> 00:14:29,291
- is just gyrating. I can't...
- Off!

339
00:14:30,208 --> 00:14:31,500
Oh, turn it off.
Turn... All right.

340
00:14:33,958 --> 00:14:36,250
What is that?
Did you learn that from Oprah?

341
00:14:36,333 --> 00:14:37,541
Join the Environmental Club.

342
00:14:37,625 --> 00:14:39,666
Come over.
We have the best cookies.

343
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:41,375
Welcome to the great
Sunset Ridge Bake-Off.

344
00:14:41,458 --> 00:14:43,541
Shouldn't these be more
prominently featured?

345
00:14:43,625 --> 00:14:45,250
<i>Bon Appétit</i> literally profiled

346
00:14:45,333 --> 00:14:46,666
my dad's restaurant
for these pastries.

347
00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:49,750
I think they're nice
and prominent over here.

348
00:14:49,833 --> 00:14:50,958
Uh, they're gourmet.

349
00:14:51,041 --> 00:14:52,333
They're soggy-bottomed.

350
00:14:52,416 --> 00:14:55,791
You know what? I think I see
the perfect spot for yours.

351
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
- Just...
- Dude!

352
00:14:58,083 --> 00:15:00,375
- Those were Gram's!
- Come on.

353
00:15:00,458 --> 00:15:05,500
You know what? I think I know
the perfect place to put this.

354
00:15:05,583 --> 00:15:07,541
You wouldn't dare.

355
00:15:10,041 --> 00:15:11,833
Oh.

356
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:15,041
Yeah. Perfect.

357
00:15:15,125 --> 00:15:16,541
Nice caramelization.

358
00:15:16,625 --> 00:15:19,000
Oh. Just...

359
00:15:20,416 --> 00:15:21,666
Oh, my God.

360
00:15:23,583 --> 00:15:26,708
Food fight!

361
00:15:27,916 --> 00:15:29,666
Food fight!

362
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:32,041
Oh, no!

363
00:15:34,958 --> 00:15:37,291
They're
attacking us from above!

364
00:15:37,375 --> 00:15:39,166
We need the high ground!

365
00:15:45,583 --> 00:15:46,833
On my signal!

366
00:15:55,208 --> 00:15:56,583
Too far, Harper.

367
00:15:57,208 --> 00:15:59,416
Stop it!
Put that down! Stop it.

368
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:01,416
Give me that. Give me that.
Put that down. Stop it!

369
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:02,916
{\an8}No, not the strudel!

370
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Please! Or the tart.

371
00:16:14,458 --> 00:16:16,750
Stop it! That got in my mouth!
Hey!

372
00:16:19,416 --> 00:16:21,083
You want a fight?
Let's fight!

373
00:16:39,250 --> 00:16:40,750
Who started...

374
00:16:41,833 --> 00:16:42,958
the food fight?

375
00:16:45,375 --> 00:16:47,000
Congratulations, you two.

376
00:16:47,083 --> 00:16:49,750
You just got everybody in here
in-school suspension.

377
00:16:49,833 --> 00:16:51,666
Thanks a lot.

378
00:16:51,750 --> 00:16:53,750
Is this key lime pie?

379
00:16:53,833 --> 00:16:56,125
Yeah, I baked it fresh
this morning.

380
00:16:56,208 --> 00:16:57,791
Well, you gotta take me
to the emergency room

381
00:16:57,875 --> 00:17:00,541
because I'm very allergic
to key lime pie.

That's not supposed to
be in there.

388
00:17:15,291 --> 00:17:16,500
- Was it for Pink Slip?
- Hmm.

389
00:17:16,583 --> 00:17:18,625
I saw them at the Troubadour
last year.

390
00:17:20,791 --> 00:17:22,833
Could I sing your song
this weekend?

391
00:17:22,916 --> 00:17:23,958
Oh, no.

392
00:17:24,041 --> 00:17:25,833
You'll have way better stuff
than something I wrote.

393
00:17:25,916 --> 00:17:28,041
I wrote that
after I left Pink Slip anyway.

394
00:17:28,125 --> 00:17:30,916
Okay. I got this.

395
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,333
Yes, you got this.

396
00:17:32,416 --> 00:17:34,375
Opening your world tour
at the Wiltern

397
00:17:34,458 --> 00:17:37,166
is a big show for you. Huge.

398
00:17:38,541 --> 00:17:39,666
For the both of us.

399
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:42,208
The girls are struggling with
this transition, and just...

400
00:17:42,291 --> 00:17:44,958
just take it from a parent
who has been in your shoes.

401
00:17:45,041 --> 00:17:48,083
I know, Tess, between losing
Lily's mum and moving here...

402
00:17:48,166 --> 00:17:51,375
Yes, and being ripped away
from the home she grew up in.

403
00:17:51,458 --> 00:17:53,208
Oh, I'm sorry. Are we talking
about Lily or about Harper?

404
00:17:53,291 --> 00:17:54,291
Harp? Lily?

405
00:17:54,375 --> 00:17:55,375
That is really annoying.

406
00:17:55,458 --> 00:17:57,291
- No, it's just...
- Hey. What the...

407
00:17:57,375 --> 00:17:59,000
What's going on?

408
00:17:59,083 --> 00:18:00,208
- Darling...
- No one's hurt.

409
00:18:00,291 --> 00:18:01,125
I went to the school...

410
00:18:01,208 --> 00:18:02,416
Please let me
just handle this.

411
00:18:03,958 --> 00:18:06,041
Anna, there's been
an incident at school

412
00:18:06,125 --> 00:18:07,458
between the girls.
It was really bad.

413
00:18:07,541 --> 00:18:11,916
- What bad? How bad? Oh--
- I've got this.

414
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,166
Girls, apologize
to each other now, please.

415
00:18:14,250 --> 00:18:16,583
Ooh, honey, forced apologies

416
00:18:16,666 --> 00:18:17,750
is never a way
to resolve conflict.

417
00:18:17,833 --> 00:18:18,833
- That...
- But...

418
00:18:18,916 --> 00:18:21,791
We need to make space for them
to express how they feel.

419
00:18:23,666 --> 00:18:25,541
Harper, how do you feel?

420
00:18:27,041 --> 00:18:28,750
I feel...

421
00:18:28,833 --> 00:18:29,708
sorry.

422
00:18:30,583 --> 00:18:32,125
And, Lily, how do you feel?

423
00:18:32,916 --> 00:18:34,416
I feel...

424
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:35,333
...sorry too.

425
00:18:35,416 --> 00:18:36,500
That's great.

426
00:18:36,583 --> 00:18:37,416
- Great.
- See?

427
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:39,208
Sorry that my future
stepsister is a complete twit.

428
00:18:39,291 --> 00:18:41,375
I'm sorry that my future
stepsister is a shallow idiot.

429
00:18:41,458 --> 00:18:43,375
- Oh, am I? Really?
- New plan!

430
00:18:43,458 --> 00:18:45,000
No more holding space
for feelings.

431
00:18:45,083 --> 00:18:46,666
You two are gonna have
a lovely time

432
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:47,875
at my bachelorette tonight.

433
00:18:47,958 --> 00:18:49,541
You're gonna get along
because we're a family,

434
00:18:49,625 --> 00:18:50,750
and families love each other!

435
00:18:50,833 --> 00:18:52,791
And for that, Harper,
just for that look,

436
00:18:52,875 --> 00:18:56,083
you two earned yourself
a sleepover at Gram's.

437
00:18:56,166 --> 00:18:57,875
Huh? Whoa, whoa, whoa!

438
00:18:57,958 --> 00:19:00,958
Why am I the punishment?
I'm the fun one.

439
00:19:01,041 --> 00:19:02,500
- I have board games.
- Mom.

440
00:19:02,583 --> 00:19:04,000
I have Parcheesi.

441
00:19:04,083 --> 00:19:05,500
And you're gonna braid
each other's hair

442
00:19:05,583 --> 00:19:07,291
in a non
cultural-appropriating way

443
00:19:07,375 --> 00:19:08,208
and like it.

444
00:19:08,291 --> 00:19:09,375
What is Parcheesi?

445
00:19:09,458 --> 00:19:10,833
- It's a game.
- I'm not quite sure.

446
00:19:10,916 --> 00:19:13,000
You move around the board.
You shake the dice.

447
00:19:13,083 --> 00:19:14,625
You remember the sound
of the dice?

448
00:19:14,708 --> 00:19:15,541
Oh, it's amazing.

449
00:19:15,625 --> 00:19:16,625
You get these dice,

450
00:19:16,708 --> 00:19:17,916
and you shake 'em
in your hand,

451
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,666
- you move around the board.
- Oh, Grams.

452
00:19:19,750 --> 00:19:20,833
It's really fun.

453
00:19:20,916 --> 00:19:22,541
I also have Boggle!

454
00:19:22,625 --> 00:19:24,958
You stay on your side,
and I'll stay on mine.

455
00:19:26,041 --> 00:19:27,041
Gladly.

456
00:19:28,333 --> 00:19:29,333
Harper, look,

457
00:19:29,416 --> 00:19:31,166
I know you think
I don't get it, but I do.

458
00:19:31,250 --> 00:19:32,750
And it's still just gonna
be you and me.

459
00:19:32,833 --> 00:19:36,166
If you go to London,
I'm staying here with Grams.

460
00:19:36,250 --> 00:19:37,791
- She said it was cool.
- She what?

461
00:19:37,875 --> 00:19:42,000
Hey, Anna! Did you remove me
as Harper's secondary contact?

462
00:19:42,083 --> 00:19:44,708
Did you tell Harper that she
could stay here with you

463
00:19:44,791 --> 00:19:46,625
if we decided to
move to London?

464
00:19:48,291 --> 00:19:50,750
- Are you serious right now?
- Whoa. Are you serious?

465
00:19:50,833 --> 00:19:51,833
- Okay, okay.
- Why are you--

466
00:19:51,916 --> 00:19:52,875
What is serious

467
00:19:52,958 --> 00:19:56,958
is that you and Eric need to
keep the girls in Los Angeles.

468
00:19:57,041 --> 00:19:59,375
Lily just needs some guidance.

469
00:19:59,916 --> 00:20:01,458
The only guidance
I need from you

470
00:20:01,541 --> 00:20:02,791
is to show me
to the other bathroom.

471
00:20:04,625 --> 00:20:06,750
I'm very sorry, Lily.
I didn't know--

472
00:20:06,833 --> 00:20:07,833
You don't know anything

473
00:20:07,916 --> 00:20:10,166
about what I need
or how I feel,

474
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:12,875
or the fashion school
back home that I wanna go to.

475
00:20:12,958 --> 00:20:14,041
Oh!

476
00:20:14,541 --> 00:20:16,708
Yep. Just you and me, Mom.

477
00:20:17,416 --> 00:20:18,416
Great.

478
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:19,666
<i> Welcome, everyone,</i>

479
00:20:19,750 --> 00:20:22,125
<i>to the bachelorette party</i>
<i>of our girl, Anna.</i>

480
00:20:26,166 --> 00:20:28,541
Mom, for real?

481
00:20:28,625 --> 00:20:30,375
Why would you?

482
00:20:30,458 --> 00:20:32,375
- Haven't changed.
- Not a bit.

483
00:20:33,291 --> 00:20:35,833
- Anna!
- It's so funny.

484
00:20:35,916 --> 00:20:36,750
Get it, girl!

485
00:20:36,833 --> 00:20:38,166
I remember that six-pack.

486
00:20:38,250 --> 00:20:40,333
- Yeah, who is that?
- So handsome.

487
00:20:40,416 --> 00:20:42,208
That is Jake.

488
00:20:42,833 --> 00:20:44,291
Your mom's first love.

489
00:20:44,375 --> 00:20:46,458
{\an8}And her first ride
on a motorcycle.

490
00:20:46,541 --> 00:20:49,375
I like to ride
in Jake's motorcycle.

491
00:20:49,458 --> 00:20:50,458
Okay.

492
00:20:50,541 --> 00:20:52,791
Jake also had
a thing for Tess.

493
00:20:52,875 --> 00:20:53,708
For Grams?

494
00:20:53,791 --> 00:20:56,041
All right, okay. Enough
humiliation for the night.

495
00:21:10,625 --> 00:21:14,041
Harper, baby,
I made you a plate.

496
00:21:14,125 --> 00:21:16,666
Here you go. You're too young
to be sad. Come on.

497
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:18,791
Well, being young
is overrated, Mama P.

498
00:21:18,875 --> 00:21:19,916
Eat. You'll be fine.

499
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,041
Use the tongs.

500
00:21:43,041 --> 00:21:45,583
Lily? Mind if I join you?

501
00:21:49,916 --> 00:21:52,291
You know,
Anna lost her father

502
00:21:53,166 --> 00:21:55,333
around the same age
that you lost your mother.

503
00:21:57,458 --> 00:22:00,500
And then she had to deal with
my wedding to Ryan.

504
00:22:00,583 --> 00:22:01,958
Cool.

505
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:06,791
And then you add to that
the complications of moving.

506
00:22:07,916 --> 00:22:08,916
I'm here for you.

507
00:22:10,875 --> 00:22:12,041
Sincerely.

508
00:22:15,541 --> 00:22:17,708
With all due respect,
Dr. Coleman,

509
00:22:18,416 --> 00:22:20,750
you're not my gran
or my therapist.

510
00:22:20,833 --> 00:22:22,833
So, while I get your motive
for keeping us in LA,

511
00:22:23,750 --> 00:22:24,750
I don't need your help.

512
00:22:30,333 --> 00:22:33,083
Oh, no.
We used to be so cool.

513
00:22:33,166 --> 00:22:35,875
- Hey, I'm still cool.
- I look amazing.

514
00:22:35,958 --> 00:22:37,791
You're very cool. That song
you sent me was sick.

515
00:22:37,875 --> 00:22:39,000
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

516
00:22:39,083 --> 00:22:40,500
I wish I had
more time to write.

517
00:22:40,583 --> 00:22:42,916
But now all I do is
listen to parenting podcasts.

518
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:46,166
Well, I'm sorry for ruining
your exciting rock star life.

519
00:22:46,250 --> 00:22:47,541
Harper, wait. I was just--

520
00:22:48,291 --> 00:22:49,958
Wait, I wasn't serious.

521
00:22:50,041 --> 00:22:52,166
Look, I gave up performing,
but I have you.

522
00:22:52,250 --> 00:22:55,541
- Enjoy your party.
- You can't leave.

523
00:22:56,083 --> 00:22:57,916
I don't think I belong
in here, Grams.

524
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,041
Let me handle this.
I've got you.

525
00:22:59,125 --> 00:23:00,750
- Harper!
- Anna,

526
00:23:00,833 --> 00:23:03,250
honey, you just need
to pause and reframe.

527
00:23:03,333 --> 00:23:04,916
- Thanks, Mom.
- What?

528
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,416
- What did I do?
- I was handling it.

529
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:08,166
And you completely undermine
me as a parent.

530
00:23:08,250 --> 00:23:09,458
I was trying to help you.

531
00:23:09,541 --> 00:23:10,583
Well,
your help isn't helpful.

532
00:23:10,666 --> 00:23:12,625
Well, that's not
very nice to say.

533
00:23:12,708 --> 00:23:15,458
Can the great and mysterious
Madame Jen

534
00:23:15,541 --> 00:23:17,875
interest you ladies
in a psychic reading?

535
00:23:18,958 --> 00:23:21,250
No.
Thank you very much,

536
00:23:21,333 --> 00:23:23,166
but, um,
right now is not the...

537
00:23:23,250 --> 00:23:24,291
Time?

538
00:23:24,375 --> 00:23:26,416
- It's just not really our...
- Thing?

539
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:28,916
This will all be over soon,
if you just...

540
00:23:30,041 --> 00:23:31,833
- Go with it.
- Go with it. Yes, exactly.

541
00:23:31,916 --> 00:23:33,166
- Come on in. Yes. Yes.
- No. No.

542
00:23:33,250 --> 00:23:34,416
- Come.
- Okay, I'm coming. Here we go.

543
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:35,791
- Anybody else interested?
- Let's try this out.

544
00:23:35,875 --> 00:23:37,666
I do discounts
for bigger groups. Okay?

545
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:39,458
Okay. That's fine.
That's good.

546
00:23:41,041 --> 00:23:42,458
And that's how I lost my spot

547
00:23:42,541 --> 00:23:44,166
at the Larchmont
Farmers' Market.

548
00:23:44,250 --> 00:23:46,625
But I did get a table
by the lids

549
00:23:46,708 --> 00:23:49,333
and free milk counter
inside of the Starbucks.

550
00:23:49,416 --> 00:23:53,416
{\an8}So, I am a life coach,
but I also do Reiki.

551
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:55,500
If you notice,
I have several business cards,

552
00:23:55,583 --> 00:23:56,750
because I actually have

553
00:23:56,833 --> 00:23:59,083
a business-card-making
business.

554
00:23:59,166 --> 00:24:00,291
So, that's the card for that.

555
00:24:00,375 --> 00:24:01,958
Uh, I can put quotes on there

556
00:24:02,041 --> 00:24:03,958
that I can just make up
for you.

557
00:24:04,041 --> 00:24:06,291
If you want something
inspirational, for example,

558
00:24:06,375 --> 00:24:08,791
I can make up
a quote like, um...

559
00:24:08,875 --> 00:24:11,041
"Live your life...

560
00:24:11,125 --> 00:24:12,166
gosh dang it."

561
00:24:12,250 --> 00:24:13,666
- Okay.
- So, here's--

562
00:24:13,750 --> 00:24:18,708
And-And-And I'm gonna read
your palms now.

563
00:24:18,791 --> 00:24:19,958
- 'Cause that's--
- Really?

564
00:24:22,791 --> 00:24:27,125
Okay. And there they go. Yes.

565
00:24:28,041 --> 00:24:29,500
Eenie, meenie, miney...

566
00:24:30,250 --> 00:24:31,916
Hmm.

567
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:35,000
Okay. It smells like
you had some appetizers.

568
00:24:35,083 --> 00:24:36,208
- Were they good?
- Good.

569
00:24:36,291 --> 00:24:37,541
- Good. Yes.
- Yeah. Yes.

570
00:24:38,250 --> 00:24:39,708
And did you have any, Mom?

571
00:24:41,541 --> 00:24:44,833
- Um, no. Mm-mmm. No. I didn't.
- I'm-- No. No. Didn't--

572
00:24:44,916 --> 00:24:46,583
- 'Cause I paid for them.
- I paid for them.

573
00:24:46,666 --> 00:24:49,875
- It's a wedding. Okay.
- Okay. Okay, okay.

574
00:24:49,958 --> 00:24:53,625
Your life lines. It...
It's like they've...

575
00:24:56,333 --> 00:24:58,041
intersected before.

576
00:24:58,708 --> 00:25:00,125
- How strange.
- Really?

577
00:25:01,666 --> 00:25:04,833
You've walked
in each other's path.

578
00:25:06,083 --> 00:25:11,583
It's like a crazy path-cross
that you've done.

579
00:25:16,583 --> 00:25:18,333
You've learned a lesson.

580
00:25:18,416 --> 00:25:20,875
A lesson that may
serve you again.

581
00:25:20,958 --> 00:25:22,625
- Okay. That's enough.
- Thank you. Okay.

582
00:25:22,708 --> 00:25:24,125
We'll give these
to my neighbors.

583
00:25:24,208 --> 00:25:25,708
I'm onto something here.

584
00:25:25,791 --> 00:25:28,625
One more thing.

585
00:25:28,708 --> 00:25:31,291
Right over there is a QR code
that you can tip me with.

586
00:25:31,375 --> 00:25:33,541
Any amount is appreciated.
Really.

587
00:25:33,625 --> 00:25:35,500
I didn't know
I could do that voice.

588
00:25:35,583 --> 00:25:37,958
- Nice prank. Ha-ha.
- Yeah, we know what you did.

589
00:25:38,041 --> 00:25:39,166
What did I do?

590
00:25:39,250 --> 00:25:40,500
What do you mean? The psychic.

591
00:25:40,583 --> 00:25:42,916
- Yeah. Telling her about--
- What-- Okay, okay.

592
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,500
You think
I'd rather solve your problem

593
00:25:45,583 --> 00:25:48,958
than deal with my booming
culinary empire.

Are you the psychic?

598
00:25:57,500 --> 00:25:58,708
I need you to
look into my future

599
00:25:58,791 --> 00:26:00,000
and tell me where
we're going to live.

600

Oh.
Cool Gen Z talking to me.

Boop. Beep.

608
00:26:22,458 --> 00:26:24,291
You don't have
a lot of lines in your hands,

609
00:26:24,375 --> 00:26:25,583
so it makes it harder for me.

610
00:26:25,666 --> 00:26:27,833
You two are called
to be family.

611
00:26:27,916 --> 00:26:30,208
- Yeah, right.
- Don't remind me.

612
00:26:32,291 --> 00:26:33,666

00:29:48,208 --> 00:29:49,708
No.

00:29:49,791 --> 00:29:53,625
No. No. No, no, no.

669
00:29:54,458 --> 00:29:57,875
- I'm bloody decomposing!
- Oh, my.

670
00:30:03,625 --> 00:30:04,833
Harper?

671
00:30:04,916 --> 00:30:07,208
- Oh, my God.
- Whoa.

672
00:30:07,291 --> 00:30:08,583
- What is happening?
- I know.

673
00:30:08,666 --> 00:30:10,291
It's me, Harp. It's Mom.

674
00:30:10,375 --> 00:30:11,291
What are you saying?

675
00:30:11,375 --> 00:30:14,375
So if you're me and I'm you,
then... then who is that?

676
00:30:15,291 --> 00:30:16,583
I'm Grandma, sweetheart.

677
00:30:22,750 --> 00:30:25,208
Oh, my gosh! I've died.

678
00:30:25,291 --> 00:30:27,666
I killed myself!

679
00:30:27,750 --> 00:30:30,416
She just has crevices
all over her face.

680
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:32,125
Look at the crevices.

681
00:30:32,208 --> 00:30:34,041
My hands look like doll hands.

682
00:30:34,125 --> 00:30:36,000
My butt feels so high.

683
00:30:36,083 --> 00:30:37,500
I think I just peed a little.

684
00:30:37,583 --> 00:30:38,833
Oh, no.

685
00:30:38,916 --> 00:30:42,250
My face
feels so thirsty and dry.

686
00:30:42,333 --> 00:30:44,833
My face is perfect.

687
00:30:44,916 --> 00:30:47,166
My face
looks like a Birkin bag

688
00:30:47,250 --> 00:30:50,583
that's been left out
in the sun to rot.

689
00:30:51,291 --> 00:30:52,375
Why?

690
00:30:52,458 --> 00:30:54,291
Why do I have to pee again?

691
00:30:54,375 --> 00:30:56,750
This is so much weirder
than the last time.

692
00:30:56,833 --> 00:30:58,541
Last time? What last time?

693
00:30:58,625 --> 00:31:00,166
How come you never told me?

694
00:31:00,250 --> 00:31:02,416
We never told anyone,
sweetheart. Overnight oats.

695
00:31:02,500 --> 00:31:04,250
Now let's just pause
and reframe.

696
00:31:04,333 --> 00:31:06,333
No. I didn't want to be
a part of this family

697
00:31:06,416 --> 00:31:09,416
and now I'm part
of some dodgy family curse?

698
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:11,416
- And I'm the eldest?
- Mom.

699
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:14,791
And where are her lips?
She has no lips!

700
00:31:14,875 --> 00:31:15,916
Where did they go?

701
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,250
How do we fix this?

702
00:31:18,291 --> 00:31:19,958
Well, you know, last time,
we switched back

703
00:31:20,041 --> 00:31:22,250
when we saw things
from the other's perspective.

704
00:31:22,333 --> 00:31:23,291
Should we hold hands?

705
00:31:23,375 --> 00:31:24,500
- Hold my hands.
- Well, we can--

706
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,458
- Just...
- Yeah.

707
00:31:27,333 --> 00:31:29,375
I know I've been hard
on you and Eric,

708
00:31:29,458 --> 00:31:32,083
but I can now see that
you're doing the right thing.

709
00:31:32,166 --> 00:31:37,500
And, Mom, you have always done
so much for me, and I see you.

710
00:31:42,333 --> 00:31:43,708
I see you.

711
00:31:43,791 --> 00:31:45,333
- Are you really seeing me?
- Mm-hmm. I really see you.

712
00:31:45,416 --> 00:31:46,750
Because I don't feel anything.

713
00:31:46,833 --> 00:31:49,333
You have no idea how hard
I'm seeing you right now.

714
00:31:49,416 --> 00:31:50,958
- One, two, three.
- ...three.

715
00:31:51,875 --> 00:31:53,541
Girls, that doesn't work.

716
00:31:53,625 --> 00:31:54,916
Yeah, we tried that last time.

717
00:31:56,208 --> 00:31:57,833
Looking like this

718
00:31:57,916 --> 00:32:00,750
is why people like you
become shut-ins,

719
00:32:00,833 --> 00:32:03,375
and what's with this accent?
"Tomato."

720
00:32:03,458 --> 00:32:05,375
Is that what you think
I sound like?

721
00:32:05,458 --> 00:32:06,750
Oh, my God, yes.

722
00:32:06,833 --> 00:32:08,791
Of course this is
what you sound like.

723
00:32:08,875 --> 00:32:10,125
- Let's go to Erewhon...
- I do not sound like that.

724
00:32:10,208 --> 00:32:12,583
I've never said that.
I don't even know...

725
00:32:12,666 --> 00:32:14,500
Then I need to
call my energy healer

726
00:32:14,583 --> 00:32:16,083
because I need a chakra reset.

727
00:32:16,166 --> 00:32:18,000
- That's what you sound like.
- The healer.

728
00:32:19,208 --> 00:32:20,333
Madame Jen.

729
00:32:20,833 --> 00:32:22,041
I thought she was a psychic.

730
00:32:22,125 --> 00:32:24,375
Ow. I thought she did
sound baths for dogs.

731
00:32:24,458 --> 00:32:26,083
I thought she was
a water sommelier.

732
00:32:26,166 --> 00:32:27,541
She did try to sell me knives.

733
00:32:27,625 --> 00:32:30,208
What? No, well,
whatever she is,

734
00:32:30,291 --> 00:32:32,958
we have to find her,
but until then...

735
00:32:33,041 --> 00:32:34,333
"Until then" what?

736
00:32:34,416 --> 00:32:36,500
Last time
we convinced everyone

737
00:32:36,583 --> 00:32:38,291
that we were each other
until we switched back.

738
00:32:38,375 --> 00:32:41,958
Oh, brilliant. So how are we
supposed to pull that off?

739
00:32:42,041 --> 00:32:44,833
Well, panicking is not
going to help anyone!

740
00:32:44,916 --> 00:32:46,416
- I need you to get dressed.
- This sucks!

741
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:48,541
- Go. Go get--
- No! Stop.

742
00:32:48,625 --> 00:32:50,500
Bye, girls.
It's going to be great.

743
00:32:50,583 --> 00:32:51,833
Look, Mom.

744
00:32:51,916 --> 00:32:53,833
I kept it totally together
in front of the girls,

745
00:32:53,916 --> 00:32:56,875
but I have to be honest,
I am freaking out right now!

746
00:32:56,958 --> 00:32:59,125
That was you
keeping it totally together?

747
00:32:59,208 --> 00:33:00,083
Yes!

748
00:33:00,166 --> 00:33:01,583
No, no. Just checking.

749
00:33:02,625 --> 00:33:04,000
Aura photographer.

750
00:33:04,083 --> 00:33:05,791
Hmm. Twenty percent off
on her Etsy shop.

751
00:33:05,875 --> 00:33:06,958
I can't get married.

752
00:33:07,041 --> 00:33:08,458
I haven't even
had a boyfriend yet.

753
00:33:08,541 --> 00:33:10,291
We have to switch back
to our bodies.

754
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:14,750
At least your body
didn't wake up with arthritis.

755
00:33:14,833 --> 00:33:16,416
It's disconnected.

756
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:18,291
I guess her life coaching
business went bust.

757
00:33:18,375 --> 00:33:20,041
I'm supposed to get married
this weekend.

758
00:33:20,125 --> 00:33:21,166
What are these?

759
00:33:21,250 --> 00:33:24,208
And how many puffer jackets
does someone need?

760
00:33:24,291 --> 00:33:26,458
- Hmm. Reiki master.
- What? What'd you find?

761
00:33:27,208 --> 00:33:31,166
I bent down and didn't toot.

762
00:33:32,250 --> 00:33:33,958
Youth really is wasted
on the young.

763
00:33:34,041 --> 00:33:38,375
And what's with the old
tissues in every pocket?

764
00:33:38,458 --> 00:33:39,666
Explain.

765
00:33:40,708 --> 00:33:42,916
No answer at Reiki. Now what?

766
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,541
Did you try
her vegan meat loaf truck?

767
00:33:44,625 --> 00:33:46,750
They don't have a number,
and they only use DoorDash,

768
00:33:46,833 --> 00:33:48,041
and I don't know
how to do that.

769
00:33:48,125 --> 00:33:51,500
I look
Eileen Fisher years old.

770
00:33:52,625 --> 00:33:55,083
I'm literally my mother.

771
00:33:55,166 --> 00:33:57,458
I'm going to need therapy
for the rest of my life

772
00:33:57,541 --> 00:33:58,958
and not the kind from Grams.

773
00:33:59,041 --> 00:34:01,875
Like the real kind
that you have to pay for.

774
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:04,375
Why does anyone wear these?

775
00:34:04,458 --> 00:34:06,500
Did she say anything,
like a fortune?

776
00:34:06,583 --> 00:34:09,541
No, but maybe
she told the girls.

777
00:34:09,625 --> 00:34:11,250
Did the psychic say anything

778
00:34:11,333 --> 00:34:13,041
to you about a fortune?

779
00:34:13,125 --> 00:34:14,750
It could be the key
to getting out of this.

780
00:34:15,833 --> 00:34:17,000
- Wait, she did, right?
- She did.

781
00:34:17,083 --> 00:34:18,083
What was it?

782
00:34:18,166 --> 00:34:20,666
"Change the hearts
you know are wrong

783
00:34:20,750 --> 00:34:23,250
to reach the place
where you belong."

784
00:34:23,333 --> 00:34:25,666
That's about our
parents getting married.

785
00:34:25,750 --> 00:34:28,416
LA. London.

786
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:31,458
As teenagers,
we have no power.

787
00:34:31,541 --> 00:34:36,166
No say in whether we move
or stay, but as adults...

788
00:34:37,916 --> 00:34:39,625
Mom, she didn't
say anything to us!

789
00:34:40,916 --> 00:34:43,458
Oh.

790
00:34:43,541 --> 00:34:45,416
Whoa. Anna. Anna!

791
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:47,250
You do not hit me.
I am your mother, young lady.

792
00:34:47,333 --> 00:34:49,791
- So, what do you say?
- Well, then...

793
00:34:49,875 --> 00:34:52,208
- It's not working!
- We need a plan.

794
00:34:52,291 --> 00:34:53,458
Not my fault!

795
00:34:54,208 --> 00:34:56,125
- DK doughnuts!
- She'll love those.

796
00:34:56,208 --> 00:34:58,125
- Harper, got 'em.
- I... I'll love them.

797
00:34:58,208 --> 00:35:00,208
Hey, girls.
How was the sleepover?

798
00:35:00,291 --> 00:35:02,041
- Good.
- Very good.

799
00:35:02,125 --> 00:35:03,250
- We did teenager stuff.
- Very good.

800
00:35:05,541 --> 00:35:06,541
{\an8}So here's our plan.

801
00:35:06,625 --> 00:35:09,166
{\an8}First,
these clothes are rubbish.

802
00:35:09,250 --> 00:35:10,541
I just can't.

803
00:35:10,625 --> 00:35:14,833
Can you just give me
five minutes?

804
00:35:27,791 --> 00:35:29,000
- What?
- Oh, no.

805
00:35:29,083 --> 00:35:30,708
How? Why?

806
00:35:30,791 --> 00:35:32,208
<i>You're in your mum's body,</i>

807
00:35:32,291 --> 00:35:34,291
so all you have to do
is tell my dad

808
00:35:34,375 --> 00:35:36,166
you don't love him anymore.

809
00:35:36,250 --> 00:35:37,500
Wedding is off. Done.

810
00:35:37,583 --> 00:35:40,375
Whoa. Got some bangs.

811
00:35:40,458 --> 00:35:42,625
- What did you do to my hair?
- I fixed it.

812
00:35:42,708 --> 00:35:43,875
And you're welcome.

813
00:35:43,958 --> 00:35:45,375
- It's called a fringe.
- Fixed it.

814
00:35:45,458 --> 00:35:46,333
You don't seriously think

815
00:35:46,416 --> 00:35:47,666
you're going to my work
dressed like this.

816
00:35:47,750 --> 00:35:48,875
Take that off.
You're going to get me fired.

817
00:35:48,958 --> 00:35:50,708
- What'd you do to my hair?
- I straightened it.

818
00:35:50,791 --> 00:35:51,833
You never wash your hair.

819
00:35:51,916 --> 00:35:54,208
No, I don't.
The ocean washes it for me.

820
00:35:54,291 --> 00:35:56,375
<i>Obviously,</i>
<i>the wedding can't happen.</i>

821
00:35:56,458 --> 00:35:58,041
It's Friday.
We only have till Sunday.

822
00:35:58,125 --> 00:35:59,958
We gotta do
some serious sabotage.

823
00:36:00,041 --> 00:36:02,541
<i>The immigration interview,</i>
<i>the rehearsal lunch.</i>

824
00:36:02,625 --> 00:36:06,416
Then what if we cancel
all the wedding stuff?

825
00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:08,500
The cake, place, people.

826
00:36:08,583 --> 00:36:09,833
Yes, and all we have to do

827
00:36:09,916 --> 00:36:12,875
is convince our parents
that they are incompatible.

828
00:36:12,958 --> 00:36:15,416
Which should not be hard
because my mom obviously

829
00:36:15,500 --> 00:36:17,791
should not be with some
wannabe Gordon Ramsay.

830
00:36:17,875 --> 00:36:20,291
Well, my father
doesn't want to be

831
00:36:20,375 --> 00:36:24,583
with some wannabe
Valley Village rocker mom.

832
00:36:24,666 --> 00:36:27,291
I quite like this, sexy tiger.

833
00:36:27,375 --> 00:36:28,625
- Doughnut!
- It's, um...

834
00:36:28,708 --> 00:36:30,208
It's an American superstition

835
00:36:30,291 --> 00:36:31,583
that it's bad luck
for the bride and groom

836
00:36:31,666 --> 00:36:33,416
to kiss
before they say I do so...

837
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:35,333
Really? For how long?

838
00:36:35,416 --> 00:36:37,583
For a long time.
A long, long time.

839
00:36:37,666 --> 00:36:39,083
- Really?
- Yeah. Also, uh...

840
00:36:39,166 --> 00:36:40,541
no touching hands.

841
00:36:40,625 --> 00:36:42,041
No touching at all.

842
00:36:42,125 --> 00:36:43,833
No gazing
into each other's eyes

843
00:36:43,916 --> 00:36:46,041
because it's gross. Um, yeah.

844
00:36:46,125 --> 00:36:47,666
- How odd.
- For maximum luck.

845
00:36:47,750 --> 00:36:50,916
And finally,
we must be convincing as them

846
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,125
until we break them up.

847
00:36:54,791 --> 00:36:55,791
Lily?

848
00:36:55,875 --> 00:36:56,916
- What?
- Yeah?

849
00:36:58,500 --> 00:37:00,291
Did you
just take Tess's calcium?

850
00:37:00,375 --> 00:37:01,375
Mmm.

851
00:37:06,125 --> 00:37:07,125
Mmm.

852
00:37:08,250 --> 00:37:09,250
Bone health.

853
00:37:11,541 --> 00:37:12,833
You need those.

854
00:37:12,916 --> 00:37:14,375
- You need those.
- Yes, I'll be taking them.

855
00:37:14,458 --> 00:37:15,666
Okay.

856
00:37:15,750 --> 00:37:17,250
- You need to take those.
- Give me the doughnut back.

857
00:37:17,333 --> 00:37:19,083
- No. You're very diabetic.
- Okay, girls.

858
00:37:19,166 --> 00:37:20,500
Let's crack on.

859
00:37:21,291 --> 00:37:22,666
- Oh.
- Um...

860
00:37:22,750 --> 00:37:25,625
Well, actually, uh, Lily and I
aren't feeling very well.

861
00:37:25,708 --> 00:37:26,708
We think it might be a...

862
00:37:26,791 --> 00:37:27,791
My throat.

863
00:37:27,875 --> 00:37:29,125
...smart decision
to stay home.

864
00:37:29,208 --> 00:37:32,083
This has nothing to do
with your detention?

865
00:37:32,166 --> 00:37:33,958
Oh. Uh...

866
00:37:34,041 --> 00:37:36,958
Well, you wouldn't want me
to go to school sick,

867
00:37:37,041 --> 00:37:38,083
would you, Mom?

868
00:37:38,166 --> 00:37:39,291
Hmm.

869
00:37:40,416 --> 00:37:41,458
You don't feel sick to me.

870
00:37:42,416 --> 00:37:44,208
Does she look sick
to you, Grams? I mean, Mom?

871
00:37:45,625 --> 00:37:48,250
No. They look fine.

872
00:37:48,333 --> 00:37:49,541
You have your client Ella's

873
00:37:49,625 --> 00:37:51,458
huge <i>Rolling Stone</i>
photo shoot today

874
00:37:51,541 --> 00:37:53,041
and your immigration
interview.

875
00:37:53,125 --> 00:37:55,666
Don't you need a little bit
of help with that, hmm?

876
00:37:55,750 --> 00:37:57,333
Of course she needs your help.

877
00:37:58,541 --> 00:37:59,708
Right? Kids these days.

878
00:37:59,791 --> 00:38:01,458
They'll say anything
to get out of school.

879
00:38:01,541 --> 00:38:04,166
- All right. Come on. Let's go.
- Go on. And make good choices.

880
00:38:04,250 --> 00:38:06,583
- See you at the dance studio!
- Bye! What?

881
00:38:06,666 --> 00:38:07,708
Dance studio?

882
00:38:08,791 --> 00:38:10,750
Let's go. Change at the club.
I've got your bag.

883
00:38:10,833 --> 00:38:11,833
Change?

884
00:38:11,916 --> 00:38:12,833
This is the finals.

885
00:38:12,916 --> 00:38:13,875
{\an8}Welcome, everybody,

886
00:38:13,958 --> 00:38:16,583
{\an8}to the Westside
Pickleball Championship.

887
00:38:17,125 --> 00:38:19,333
Yeah. You have
your championship today.

888
00:38:20,583 --> 00:38:21,916
I think you're gonna be late.

889
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,250
Late? Yes!
Yeah, I'm gonna be late.

890
00:38:24,333 --> 00:38:25,750
<i>Okay, newlyweds,</i>

891
00:38:25,833 --> 00:38:28,458
<i>you just made</i>
<i>your grand entrance</i>

892
00:38:28,541 --> 00:38:30,291
<i>into the wedding reception.</i>

893
00:38:30,375 --> 00:38:34,458
The lights begin to dim.
And a five, six, seven, Eric.

894
00:38:35,875 --> 00:38:38,666
- Beth, no.
- Oh, right. Like a bull.

895
00:38:39,750 --> 00:38:40,875
Yes!

896
00:38:40,958 --> 00:38:43,791
- Charging. It's a bull. Yes.
- Stallion.

897
00:38:43,875 --> 00:38:46,208
Get it, groom.
Big stallion energy.

898
00:38:46,291 --> 00:38:47,958
- It's a bull, though.
- All right.

899
00:38:48,041 --> 00:38:49,375
- So look at him.
- What?

900
00:38:49,458 --> 00:38:50,500
Eye contact, come on.

901
00:38:50,583 --> 00:38:51,958
- Hi.
- Hi.

902
00:38:52,041 --> 00:38:54,416
Tango is your pelvis.

903
00:38:54,500 --> 00:38:56,625
Pickleball.
It's a sport like tennis

904
00:38:56,708 --> 00:38:58,125
but it is pathetic.

905
00:38:58,208 --> 00:39:00,000
Tennis for lazy people,
that's what it is.

906
00:39:00,083 --> 00:39:01,625
It's like tennis
but for nonathletes.

907
00:39:01,708 --> 00:39:03,250
It's a bunch of old nutters

908
00:39:03,333 --> 00:39:05,125
with giant paddles
chasing a Wiffle ball.

909
00:39:05,208 --> 00:39:06,916
It's not bloody Wimbledon,
is it?

910
00:39:07,833 --> 00:39:08,750
Here we go.

911
00:39:09,625 --> 00:39:12,500
- That's yours!
- Okay. That was so fast.

912
00:39:12,583 --> 00:39:14,041
Oh, so aggressive!

913
00:39:14,125 --> 00:39:15,875
- What was that?
- She almost hit me!

914
00:39:16,541 --> 00:39:18,291
- Oh.
- Okay.

915
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:20,541
- No. You're going down.
- Up. Up you go.

916
00:39:20,625 --> 00:39:22,333
- I think you should go up.
- No, it's okay. It's fine.

917
00:39:22,416 --> 00:39:23,500
This is good right here.

918
00:39:23,583 --> 00:39:25,000
You're just lying
on the floor.

919
00:39:25,750 --> 00:39:27,250
Taking a little nappy-poo.

920
00:39:27,333 --> 00:39:29,333
It's not a nappy-poo,
it's tango.

921
00:39:29,416 --> 00:39:31,791
Oh, no. I'm just thinking that
maybe tango isn't our dance.

922
00:39:31,875 --> 00:39:35,208
- Um, anything else?
- Beth, what else is sexy?

923
00:39:35,833 --> 00:39:37,458
{\an8}Come on. Let's keep
our head in the game.

924
00:39:37,541 --> 00:39:39,666
{\an8}- Whoo!
- Game point, suckers.

925
00:39:52,125 --> 00:39:54,375
Drop in!

926
00:39:56,333 --> 00:39:57,875
Serena Williams,
she's got nothing

927
00:39:57,958 --> 00:39:59,291
on the sounds
these ladies are making.

928
00:39:59,375 --> 00:40:02,125
The body-thumping beat
of hip-hop.

929
00:40:02,208 --> 00:40:04,208
- Like that? Yep.
- Bop, bop, bop. Yes.

930
00:40:04,291 --> 00:40:05,625
A hop and a hip-hop.

931
00:40:05,708 --> 00:40:07,791
I've never seen this kind
of hip-hop.

932
00:40:10,958 --> 00:40:12,208
- She's on the ground.
- How is she doing that?

933
00:40:12,291 --> 00:40:13,333
That's a new move.

934
00:40:13,416 --> 00:40:15,833
That's defensive offense.
Defensive offense!

935
00:40:16,625 --> 00:40:17,541
Woman, get up!

936
00:40:20,291 --> 00:40:21,750
Oh, no!

937
00:40:21,833 --> 00:40:23,541
- That was close!
- Wow! Did you see that?

938
00:40:23,625 --> 00:40:24,708
Did you see that?

939
00:40:26,875 --> 00:40:27,875
Did we win?

940
00:40:27,958 --> 00:40:29,750
{\an8}Yes! Yes!

941
00:40:32,166 --> 00:40:33,208
{\an8}We won!

942
00:40:33,291 --> 00:40:34,250
I believe that was illegal

943
00:40:34,333 --> 00:40:35,583
and I'd like to roll back
the tapes

944
00:40:35,666 --> 00:40:36,958
and watch that one more time.

945
00:40:37,041 --> 00:40:38,416
Take that, boomers!

946
00:40:38,500 --> 00:40:40,125
- Okay. You know what, no.
- Okay, first of all--

947
00:40:40,208 --> 00:40:41,375
- Hold me back.
- You stay back.

948
00:40:41,458 --> 00:40:43,041
- We are not boomers.
- We're Gen X!

949
00:40:43,125 --> 00:40:46,333
- We are elder millennials.
- Some of the last millennials.

950
00:40:46,416 --> 00:40:47,833
- The finale.
- The finale.

951
00:40:48,416 --> 00:40:50,958
And five, six, seven, eight.

952
00:40:51,041 --> 00:40:53,666
Go! And slide. That's it.

953
00:40:56,458 --> 00:40:57,833
Get it.

954
00:40:57,916 --> 00:40:59,250
To the side. Whoo!

955
00:40:59,333 --> 00:41:00,958
Get it. Yes!

956
00:41:02,041 --> 00:41:03,708
Ow!

957
00:41:11,791 --> 00:41:13,708
And Anna.

958
00:41:13,791 --> 00:41:14,875
- Run, girl.
- Run!

959
00:41:14,958 --> 00:41:16,291
Anna.

960
00:41:16,375 --> 00:41:17,833
- Come on, let's go.
- Run!

961
00:41:17,916 --> 00:41:20,583
- Get it. Run. Run.
- Run.

962
00:41:22,208 --> 00:41:23,500
Anna.

963
00:41:25,166 --> 00:41:27,041
Mom, we're supposed
to know where to go.

964
00:41:27,125 --> 00:41:28,041
Act natural, honey.

965
00:41:28,125 --> 00:41:30,708
- Detention's that way.
- Can you tell... Okay.

966
00:41:39,541 --> 00:41:41,541
I have
an immigration interview,

967
00:41:41,625 --> 00:41:42,833
a rehearsal lunch,

968
00:41:42,916 --> 00:41:47,375
Ella’s big show, my wedding,
and I am stuck in detention!

969
00:41:47,458 --> 00:41:48,833
Well, I'm stuck here too.

970
00:41:48,916 --> 00:41:52,333
And it's the championships
for the entire Westside.

971
00:41:53,041 --> 00:41:56,125
Well, well, well.
Look who showed up.

972
00:41:56,875 --> 00:42:00,083
Lily Reyes and Harper Coleman.

973
00:42:00,791 --> 00:42:03,000
How have you not retired yet?

974
00:42:03,083 --> 00:42:06,166
The school had our pension
invested in crypto

975
00:42:06,666 --> 00:42:08,583
but since I'm not supposed
to complain about it,

976
00:42:08,666 --> 00:42:11,291
per my lawyer,
it's neither here nor there.

977
00:42:11,791 --> 00:42:14,250
So let's surrender our devices
Let's go.

978
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:18,500
- Mr. Bates... Come on.
- We just got our phones back.

979
00:42:18,583 --> 00:42:20,791
- That's right. We love school.
- Here.

980
00:42:21,291 --> 00:42:22,541
Thank you, Simon.

981
00:42:23,583 --> 00:42:27,208
And now it's time to prepare
for the most boring task

982
00:42:27,291 --> 00:42:29,500
you could ever
possibly imagine.

983
00:42:29,583 --> 00:42:33,333
Sit there, read or think only.

984
00:42:33,833 --> 00:42:36,083
No screens, books.

985
00:42:37,916 --> 00:42:38,916
Wait.

986
00:42:39,625 --> 00:42:42,833
Does he mean hours
of uninterrupted peace?

987
00:42:42,916 --> 00:42:45,416
Wipe that look of bliss
off your face.

988
00:42:45,500 --> 00:42:47,375
Get over yourself, Elton.

989
00:42:47,458 --> 00:42:49,041
This is high school,
not prison.

990
00:42:49,125 --> 00:42:50,791
Yeah, it's not a prison.

991
00:42:50,875 --> 00:42:52,625
Which, FYI, research shows

992
00:42:52,708 --> 00:42:54,541
is ineffective
at preventing recidivism.

993
00:42:54,625 --> 00:42:56,125
Yeah, "resisism".

994
00:42:56,208 --> 00:42:57,958
You know, giving back
to the community

995
00:42:58,041 --> 00:43:00,625
is a lot more effective
than trapping people inside.

996
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:03,000
Oh!

997
00:43:04,166 --> 00:43:05,791
You wanna go outside?

998
00:43:06,750 --> 00:43:07,916
Let us out.

999
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:09,958
- Yeah, let us out.
- Let us out.

1000
00:43:10,041 --> 00:43:12,250
Let us out. Let us out.

1001
00:43:12,333 --> 00:43:16,125
- Let us out. Let us out.
- Outside.

1002
00:43:16,666 --> 00:43:19,208
Move it! Let's pick it up!

1003
00:43:19,291 --> 00:43:20,583
Out of the way!

1004
00:43:20,666 --> 00:43:22,750
We need to find
Madame Jen, now.

1005
00:43:22,833 --> 00:43:24,166
We need our phones.

1006
00:43:24,875 --> 00:43:27,291
Come on, Reyes!
You run like my grandma.

1007
00:43:28,333 --> 00:43:29,625
- Pick it up.
- Rude!

1008
00:43:29,708 --> 00:43:32,166
Pick up the pace
or you'll pick up trash.

1009
00:43:32,250 --> 00:43:33,458
<i>It's in two days.</i>

1010
00:43:33,541 --> 00:43:35,125
Yeah, I know. I don't care
about the deposit.

1011
00:43:35,208 --> 00:43:36,958
- <i>And the officiant?</i>
- That includes the officiant?

1012
00:43:37,041 --> 00:43:38,500
Cancel that, too. Thank you.

1013
00:43:38,583 --> 00:43:39,833
<i>Call from Jett. Answer it?</i>

1014
00:43:39,916 --> 00:43:41,416
Is this for real? Yes.

1015
00:43:41,500 --> 00:43:42,416
<i>Where are you?</i>

1016
00:43:42,500 --> 00:43:43,958
<i>The editor</i>
<i>from </i>Rolling Stone<i> is here.</i>

1017
00:43:44,041 --> 00:43:46,208
<i>- Come on! Hurry up!</i>
- Oh, no.

1018
00:43:46,291 --> 00:43:48,541
Remember,
it's the<i> Hungry Tour.</i>

1019
00:43:48,625 --> 00:43:50,625
Trevor's allergic
to strawberries.

1020
00:43:50,708 --> 00:43:51,958
Look sweet, Ella.

1021
00:43:53,416 --> 00:43:55,416
- Ella's having a meltdown.
- Morning, Anna.

1022
00:43:55,500 --> 00:43:58,833
Hello, my staff of people
that I see all the time.

1023
00:43:58,916 --> 00:44:00,416
Can you sign off on the dress?

1024
00:44:01,291 --> 00:44:02,291
Here's your juice.

1025
00:44:02,375 --> 00:44:03,541
- Oh, thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

1026
00:44:04,250 --> 00:44:06,125
All right, so she's over here
by this...

1027
00:44:07,208 --> 00:44:08,291
- Girl, what?
- Ugh.

1028
00:44:08,791 --> 00:44:11,541
- Why would you give me that?
- You yell at me if I don't.

1029
00:44:11,625 --> 00:44:15,333
Anna. Jean shorts, rash guard.
Laundry day?

1030
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:19,541
Let's talk about
the headline for the article.

1031
00:44:19,625 --> 00:44:21,375
"It's giving It-Girl.

1032
00:44:21,458 --> 00:44:24,250
Pop star queen Ella
slays down the house."

1033
00:44:24,333 --> 00:44:26,041
- Wait, what?
- Or,

1034
00:44:26,125 --> 00:44:27,791
"We're gagging, besties.

1035
00:44:27,875 --> 00:44:30,166
Ella's new album
just hits different."

1036
00:44:30,250 --> 00:44:31,458
No, no. Just stop.

1037
00:44:31,541 --> 00:44:34,166
What deeply out-of-touch
old person came up with those?

1038
00:44:34,708 --> 00:44:37,208
- You did.
- I did? Wow.

1039
00:44:37,291 --> 00:44:38,291
Thanks, puss.

1040
00:44:38,375 --> 00:44:40,250
Okay, I really need you
to focus on Ella--

1041
00:44:40,333 --> 00:44:42,083
Okay.

1042
00:44:45,958 --> 00:44:46,958
Do something.

1043
00:44:49,083 --> 00:44:50,083
Ella?

1044
00:44:50,916 --> 00:44:53,958
Trevor unfollowed me.
And you know what that means?

1045
00:44:54,833 --> 00:44:56,125
No.

1046
00:44:56,208 --> 00:44:59,708
What it means is that

1047
00:44:59,791 --> 00:45:03,000
the whole world knows
that he dumped me.

1048
00:45:03,083 --> 00:45:04,916
It's everywhere!

1049
00:45:05,666 --> 00:45:09,166
Okay. I am your manager,
so I'm gonna manage this.

1050
00:45:09,250 --> 00:45:10,166
Okay.

1051
00:45:10,250 --> 00:45:12,625
Ryan,
I really do need to dash.

1052
00:45:12,708 --> 00:45:14,708
But they said the photographer
is back in 5 minutes.

1053
00:45:14,791 --> 00:45:16,166
Photographer?

1054
00:45:16,250 --> 00:45:17,458
Yeah.

1055
00:45:17,541 --> 00:45:18,833
For your new passport photo.

1056
00:45:18,916 --> 00:45:20,416
The one you need for
the international part

1057
00:45:20,500 --> 00:45:21,500
of your book tour?

1058
00:45:21,583 --> 00:45:22,666
Oh, yes.

1059
00:45:22,750 --> 00:45:27,166
I remember every detail
that you told me about me.

1060
00:45:27,250 --> 00:45:30,458
Yeah. I got prescriptions,
you got the essentials.

1061
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:33,041
Essentials?

1062
00:45:37,625 --> 00:45:38,958
Yes.

1063
00:45:45,750 --> 00:45:47,500
Do I need all these things?

1064
00:45:56,458 --> 00:45:58,291
I need that. Yes.

1065
00:45:59,916 --> 00:46:01,458
Where does this go?

1066
00:46:08,541 --> 00:46:11,750
What? Adult nappies?

1067
00:46:11,833 --> 00:46:13,750
That is so lazy.

1068
00:46:15,375 --> 00:46:17,291
- Oh, hey.
- Yes. Right here.

1069
00:46:20,416 --> 00:46:21,791
- Fixodent?
- Yes.

1070
00:46:21,875 --> 00:46:23,750
Isn't that toothpaste
for old people?

1071
00:46:24,291 --> 00:46:26,750
No. This is for when
you lose your teeth.

1072
00:46:31,250 --> 00:46:32,958
I'm gonna lose my teeth?

1073
00:46:34,250 --> 00:46:35,250
No!

1074
00:46:35,333 --> 00:46:36,958
Okay, slowpokes.

1075
00:46:37,041 --> 00:46:40,500
I want every blue spirulina
smoothie spill gone.

1076
00:46:40,583 --> 00:46:42,625
I want every
chia seed scraped.

1077
00:46:42,708 --> 00:46:44,625
Every chewed piece
of organic gum

1078
00:46:44,708 --> 00:46:46,541
on the bottoms
of these seats gone!

1079
00:46:46,625 --> 00:46:47,583
Way to go, Harper.

1080
00:46:47,666 --> 00:46:49,000
Use your nails if you have to.

1081
00:46:49,083 --> 00:46:52,041
What?
No, this was Lily's fault.

1082
00:46:52,125 --> 00:46:53,125
Elton.

1083
00:46:54,541 --> 00:46:55,541
Yeah?

1084
00:46:55,625 --> 00:46:58,958
I understand that you
feel the need to prove a point

1085
00:46:59,041 --> 00:47:01,708
because I publicly undermined
your authority.

1086
00:47:01,791 --> 00:47:02,791
Oh!

1087
00:47:04,375 --> 00:47:06,375
Do you understand me?

1088
00:47:06,458 --> 00:47:07,750
This isn't
restorative justice.

1089
00:47:07,833 --> 00:47:09,208
I mean, if anything,

1090
00:47:09,291 --> 00:47:11,666
you're making these kids
want to act out more.

1091
00:47:11,750 --> 00:47:14,458
How does Lily always manage
to make things worse?

1092
00:47:14,541 --> 00:47:15,708
It's a unique talent.

1093
00:47:15,791 --> 00:47:17,875
I have connections
on the school board, Elton.

1094
00:47:17,958 --> 00:47:21,416
Well, you're a stupid kid
and you have no connections,

1095
00:47:21,500 --> 00:47:25,583
but you have earned,
along with everybody here,

1096
00:47:25,666 --> 00:47:27,250
three more weeks of detention.

1097
00:47:27,333 --> 00:47:29,625
- Oh, my...
- Lily!

1098
00:47:29,708 --> 00:47:31,541
- Bro!
- Your royal highness.

1099
00:47:32,625 --> 00:47:34,083
- Come on!
- My God!

1100
00:47:34,166 --> 00:47:35,708
That was uncalled for.

1101
00:47:35,791 --> 00:47:39,875
Let's all take a deep,
centering breath.

1102
00:47:41,708 --> 00:47:43,041
Meditate on this!

1103
00:47:43,125 --> 00:47:44,458
Take a deep breath
of this trash.

1104
00:47:44,541 --> 00:47:45,541
You ready?

1105
00:47:46,416 --> 00:47:47,416
Stunning.

1106
00:47:48,458 --> 00:47:49,708
Wow.

1107
00:47:49,791 --> 00:47:50,791
Good, right?

1108
00:47:52,541 --> 00:47:54,958
I think you're having
an allergic reaction.

1109
00:47:55,041 --> 00:47:57,375
No, no, no, no.
It's lip plumper.

1110
00:47:58,166 --> 00:47:59,250
I'm gonna get some ice.

1111
00:47:59,333 --> 00:48:00,666
Okay, give me the ring light.

1112
00:48:00,750 --> 00:48:02,916
And every bottle of Benadryl
I can find.

1113
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:05,000
It's lip plumper. No, Ryan.

1114
00:48:05,083 --> 00:48:06,958
I don't have allergies.

1115
00:48:07,041 --> 00:48:08,250
Oh. Okay, whatever.

1116
00:48:08,333 --> 00:48:09,500
Do you have another
ring light?

1117
00:48:09,583 --> 00:48:11,208
- Like, a big ring light?
- Sure.

1118
00:48:11,291 --> 00:48:13,333
- And another thing. Can you...
- Yeah, okay.

1119
00:48:13,416 --> 00:48:15,791
You hold the ring light.
I'll pose. Okay, ready?

1120
00:48:15,875 --> 00:48:16,875
I got it.

1121
00:48:21,083 --> 00:48:22,458
Let me look. Hold on.

1122
00:48:23,750 --> 00:48:27,166
Oh, no.
Just 10, maybe 15 more.

1123
00:48:27,250 --> 00:48:30,083
I'll give you looks, okay?
All right, here I go.

1124
00:48:33,041 --> 00:48:35,791
"Dear Sir, must cancel
the wedding venue

1125
00:48:35,875 --> 00:48:37,291
because the bride is horrible,

1126
00:48:37,375 --> 00:48:39,291
as my daughter
always suspected."

1127
00:48:40,625 --> 00:48:41,750
Who's Laura?

1128
00:48:41,833 --> 00:48:42,875
Hello, hello.

1129
00:48:42,958 --> 00:48:45,750
<i>Hey, hon. I need your</i>
<i>approval on the author photo.</i>

1130
00:48:45,833 --> 00:48:47,625
- Okay.
- <i>Texting it over now.</i>

1131
00:48:48,583 --> 00:48:51,375
Oh, no. No, no.

1132
00:48:51,458 --> 00:48:52,875
That one's rubbish.

1133
00:48:52,958 --> 00:48:54,916
I just took a new one.

1134
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:56,875
- I'm sending now.
- <i>Thanks.</i>

1135
00:48:56,958 --> 00:49:00,916
Oh, look. Her phone has
the giant letter virus.

1136
00:49:03,875 --> 00:49:07,416
Ryan. Is it possible for you
to drop me at Anna's work?

1137
00:49:07,500 --> 00:49:08,875
<i>Hey, you Trevorheads.</i>

1138
00:49:08,958 --> 00:49:10,250
<i>That was your boy,</i>
<i>Trevor Travis,</i>

1139
00:49:10,333 --> 00:49:11,708
<i>with his brand-new song,</i>

1140
00:49:11,791 --> 00:49:12,916
<i>"Better than the Last One."</i>

1141
00:49:14,083 --> 00:49:15,916
My mom's biggest client
is having a meltdown.

1142
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:17,208
- Jett!
- I'm working!

1143
00:49:17,291 --> 00:49:19,250
Trevor, her boyfriend,
dumped her.

1144
00:49:20,750 --> 00:49:21,750
Trevor Travis?

1145
00:49:22,416 --> 00:49:25,583
<i>She's so much better, better</i>

1146
00:49:25,666 --> 00:49:26,833
<i>Better than the</i>

1147
00:49:27,333 --> 00:49:29,750
<i>Last one</i>

1148
00:49:31,583 --> 00:49:34,458
And they just got
matching tattoos.

1149
00:49:34,541 --> 00:49:38,875
That is literally
the worst thing

1150
00:49:38,958 --> 00:49:42,250
I have ever heard happening
to anyone ever, full stop.

1151
00:49:42,333 --> 00:49:44,083
- Thank you.
- Of course.

1152
00:49:44,791 --> 00:49:46,250
Anna's getting married,

1153
00:49:46,333 --> 00:49:47,375
so she doesn't get
what it's like

1154
00:49:47,458 --> 00:49:48,916
to have your heart broken.

1155
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:51,333
I know. When I was your age,
my mom--

1156
00:49:51,416 --> 00:49:54,208
I mean,
I had this boyfriend, Jake,

1157
00:49:54,291 --> 00:49:56,666
and all my friends say
he was my first love.

1158
00:49:56,750 --> 00:49:58,458
Is that who your song's about?

1159
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:00,416
What song? My song?

1160
00:50:07,083 --> 00:50:09,250
♪ <i>See you in my dreams </i>♪

1161
00:50:11,041 --> 00:50:14,583
♪ <i>Whenever you go</i>
<i>I tear at the seams </i>♪

1162
00:50:14,666 --> 00:50:15,666
I wrote that?

1163
00:50:15,750 --> 00:50:18,291
It's really good.

1164
00:50:19,416 --> 00:50:21,916
This is a great song.

1165
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:24,166
You're really good.

1166
00:50:24,750 --> 00:50:26,416
I don't get
why you quit playing.

1167
00:50:27,958 --> 00:50:29,541
Because I had a kid

1168
00:50:29,625 --> 00:50:33,458
who I probably resent since
I'm writing songs in secret.

1169
00:50:33,541 --> 00:50:35,041
So, you miss performing?

1170
00:50:37,083 --> 00:50:39,458
I mean, yeah, probably.

1171
00:50:40,041 --> 00:50:42,125
I'm finding out a lot
about myself today.

1172
00:50:45,333 --> 00:50:48,791
Anna, your song
is the only song I loved

1173
00:50:48,875 --> 00:50:50,666
out of everything
that we got sent.

1174
00:50:50,750 --> 00:50:52,500
I know you already said no,

1175
00:50:52,583 --> 00:50:56,666
but can I please sing it
at the Wiltern tomorrow?

1176
00:50:56,750 --> 00:50:59,208
I mean, it's your concert,
your tour.

1177
00:50:59,291 --> 00:51:01,041
You should sing
whatever song you want.

1178
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:03,625
Okay. Yeah, just--

1179
00:51:03,708 --> 00:51:06,625
I feel like between managers
and stylists

1180
00:51:06,708 --> 00:51:08,916
and execs and label people,

1181
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:12,583
I feel like I never get a say
in anything that goes on.

1182
00:51:12,666 --> 00:51:13,750
Right?

1183
00:51:14,250 --> 00:51:17,541
Right, because old people
never listen.

1184
00:51:18,583 --> 00:51:20,916
I mean,
people like you think--

1185
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:22,208
I think people like me

1186
00:51:22,291 --> 00:51:23,708
think people like you
don't know any--

1187
00:51:23,791 --> 00:51:26,041
- You know what I mean.
- Yeah.

1188
00:51:26,125 --> 00:51:28,041
I have control over
my own life.

1189
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:31,125
Absolute control.
Photoshoot's back on.

1190
00:51:31,208 --> 00:51:33,125
Photoshoot is back on,
grasshoppers.

1191
00:51:33,208 --> 00:51:34,666
Chop, chop, chop.

1192
00:51:34,750 --> 00:51:37,333
Let's make some fierce photos

1193
00:51:37,416 --> 00:51:39,875
of this fierce girl
right here.

1194
00:51:39,958 --> 00:51:41,666
Bruh, having a job
is really hard.

1195
00:51:41,750 --> 00:51:43,666
- Wait.
- What? "Wait" what?

1196
00:51:43,750 --> 00:51:47,666
If your mum wrote that song
about that Jake...

1197
00:51:47,750 --> 00:51:48,583
Yeah.

1198
00:51:48,666 --> 00:51:51,125
...that's how we can get our
parents to split up forever.

1199
00:51:51,208 --> 00:51:54,541
So if she is with him,
she can't marry my dad.

1200
00:51:54,625 --> 00:51:55,791
Well, how do we find him?

1201
00:51:58,041 --> 00:52:00,833
It's like a database
of old people.

1202
00:52:00,916 --> 00:52:03,250
- Jake. Yes.
- That's him from the photo.

1203
00:52:03,333 --> 00:52:04,708
Wait, wait, wait, look.

1204
00:52:05,791 --> 00:52:06,708
Okay.

1205
00:52:06,791 --> 00:52:08,750
And he owns
the Record Parlour.

1206
00:52:08,833 --> 00:52:11,875
He has liked
all your mum's posts.

1207
00:52:11,958 --> 00:52:14,666
He is proper obsessed
with her.

1208
00:52:14,750 --> 00:52:16,625
Single. Okay, let's do it.

1209
00:52:16,708 --> 00:52:18,375
Let's do it.

1210
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:21,416
But first,
your mum must look fit

1211
00:52:21,500 --> 00:52:23,416
if she's gonna run into
the love of her life.

1212
00:52:23,500 --> 00:52:25,125
And I need to change, too.

1213
00:52:25,208 --> 00:52:28,833
Ella's stylist has pulled
the most gorgeous garms

1214
00:52:28,916 --> 00:52:30,125
I’ve ever seen
in my entire life.

1215
00:52:30,208 --> 00:52:31,416
Do we love this for me?

1216
00:52:31,500 --> 00:52:32,875
Girl, the label
loves this for you.

1217
00:52:32,958 --> 00:52:34,375
- Can we just put it on your--

1218
00:52:34,458 --> 00:52:35,666
- Maybe on your shoulder?
- No.

1219
00:52:35,750 --> 00:52:36,750

1221
00:52:39,916 --> 00:52:42,541

This is only because
of the plan.

1223
00:52:44,583 --> 00:52:46,041
- Oh, thank you.
- You're welcome.

Thank you.

1225

Harper. This is so exciting.

1227
00:53:05,416 --> 00:53:07,625
So, posing for the camera,
it's very different.

1228
00:53:07,708 --> 00:53:09,625
Find a shape and then hold it.

1229

01:00:28,125 --> 01:00:30,916
No. I'm not like that.
I wouldn't do that.

1389
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:32,458
Okay. Thank you.

1390
01:00:32,541 --> 01:00:34,583
Oh! You're not gonna hug me,
are you?

1391
01:00:34,666 --> 01:00:36,291
No, I was... Just...

1392
01:00:36,375 --> 01:00:38,250
- No, don't do that.
- Okay, it was just...

1393
01:00:38,333 --> 01:00:40,625
All right, look, no, we should
get back out there. Right?

1394
01:00:40,708 --> 01:00:43,333
Because, otherwise,
he'll think I'm pooping.

1395
01:00:43,416 --> 01:00:45,166
- There she is!
- I see her. Right by the milk.

1396
01:00:45,250 --> 01:00:47,791
And I see your screenwriting
career taking off.

1397
01:00:47,875 --> 01:00:50,333
If you move over to, um...

1398
01:00:50,416 --> 01:00:52,833
- Genre?
- Genre, yes.

1399
01:00:52,916 --> 01:00:53,833
Genre.

1400
01:00:53,916 --> 01:00:55,041
Elevated genre?

1401
01:00:55,125 --> 01:00:56,125
Um...

1402
01:00:56,666 --> 01:00:58,416
No. Sorry.

1403
01:00:58,500 --> 01:01:00,541
- You!
- Um. Oh.

1404
01:01:00,625 --> 01:01:01,666
Um...

1405
01:01:01,750 --> 01:01:02,750
How can I help?

1406
01:01:02,833 --> 01:01:06,041
Take one wild guess.

1407
01:01:06,125 --> 01:01:07,916
Are you gonna serve me papers?

1408
01:01:09,125 --> 01:01:11,208
We switched bodies.

1409
01:01:12,041 --> 01:01:13,250
Oh!

1410
01:01:13,333 --> 01:01:14,500
Oh, my gosh.

1411
01:01:15,208 --> 01:01:16,750
It actually worked.

1412
01:01:17,500 --> 01:01:19,125
That's amazing.

1413
01:01:19,208 --> 01:01:20,875
It's never worked before.

1414
01:01:20,958 --> 01:01:23,041
Um, would you guys mind
leaving me a review

1415
01:01:23,125 --> 01:01:24,125
or, like, five stars?

1416
01:01:24,208 --> 01:01:25,916
And just saying, like,
"Oh, my gosh!

1417
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:26,916
Madame Jen was so much fun..."

1418
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:28,750
Tell us how to switch back
right now.

1419
01:01:28,833 --> 01:01:29,833
Okay. All right.

1420
01:01:29,916 --> 01:01:32,375
Um, I'll consider it
if you sign up for

1421
01:01:32,458 --> 01:01:36,375
my Reiki and
financial management package.

1422
01:01:36,458 --> 01:01:39,375
Tell us how to switch back,
you multi-hyphenate lunatic!

1423
01:01:40,166 --> 01:01:42,958
Oh, my gosh.
I am a multi-hyphenate.

1424
01:01:43,041 --> 01:01:44,666
That absolutely slays.

1425
01:01:44,750 --> 01:01:47,333
I'm supposed to get married
in two days.

1426
01:01:47,416 --> 01:01:49,000
Right, okay. Um...

1427
01:01:49,958 --> 01:01:53,000
All right. Well, you have to
look at the reading.

1428
01:01:53,083 --> 01:01:56,500
- That's the only way.
- We don't know the reading.

1429
01:01:57,375 --> 01:01:59,333
Um, what are you
talking about?

1430
01:01:59,416 --> 01:02:01,541
I said the reading
directly to you both,

1431
01:02:01,625 --> 01:02:03,916
multiple times,
in a scary whisper voice.

1432
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:05,458
Because we weren't there.

1433
01:02:06,375 --> 01:02:07,375
That wasn't...

1434
01:02:07,458 --> 01:02:09,375
Right! Oh, right.

1435
01:02:09,458 --> 01:02:11,875
You weren't you
because you had switched

1436
01:02:11,958 --> 01:02:14,916
with the other women,
who are...

1437
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:16,250
Okay, that's...

1438
01:02:16,333 --> 01:02:17,833
And it makes sense.

1439
01:02:17,916 --> 01:02:22,333
Um, okay. Well...
...the reading was,

1440
01:02:22,416 --> 01:02:24,500
"Change the hearts
you know are wrong

1441
01:02:24,583 --> 01:02:27,541
to reach the place
where you belong."

1442
01:02:27,625 --> 01:02:29,333
- Didn't we try that?
- I think we tried that.

1443
01:02:29,416 --> 01:02:31,708
- We tried it.
- Okay, the problem is

1444
01:02:31,791 --> 01:02:34,291
your hearts might not be
the only ones

1445
01:02:34,375 --> 01:02:35,666
that need changing.

1446
01:02:35,750 --> 01:02:36,791
So...

1447
01:02:37,416 --> 01:02:39,291
Mmm. Cute.

1448
01:02:40,541 --> 01:02:42,416
Well, our time is up.

1449
01:02:43,125 --> 01:02:44,166
Wait, but...
No, no, no.

1450
01:02:44,250 --> 01:02:46,458
There's got to be something
else you can do, right?

1451
01:02:46,541 --> 01:02:48,958
I wish I could help you,
but my shift is starting.

1452
01:02:49,875 --> 01:02:53,750
So, what I can do for you
is get you a cortado,

1453
01:02:53,833 --> 01:02:56,083
an Americano, a...

1454
01:02:58,083 --> 01:03:01,375
...and any kind of espresso
or non-espresso drink.

1455
01:03:02,541 --> 01:03:03,541
It's your dad! Shoot!

1456
01:03:03,625 --> 01:03:05,500
This is all new inventory

1457
01:03:05,583 --> 01:03:06,833
that we need to get sorted.

1458
01:03:08,250 --> 01:03:09,416
Uh, excuse me.

1459
01:03:10,916 --> 01:03:12,000
- Tess?
- Oh!

1460
01:03:15,583 --> 01:03:17,166
What are you doing down there?

1461
01:03:18,458 --> 01:03:19,666
Stretching.

1462
01:03:21,166 --> 01:03:23,166
Ah. Yeah. I...

1463
01:03:23,791 --> 01:03:24,791
Anna didn't...

1464
01:03:24,875 --> 01:03:27,166
She didn't tell me that
you were gonna be here today.

1465
01:03:27,250 --> 01:03:28,541
- Oh!
- What interview?

1466
01:03:28,625 --> 01:03:30,250
I mean, yes, I know
the interview. Now?

1467
01:03:30,333 --> 01:03:32,708
I was just thinking
about you the other day.

1468
01:03:32,791 --> 01:03:34,083
Really?

1469
01:03:34,708 --> 01:03:36,000
I've been meaning to
ask you something.

1470
01:03:36,083 --> 01:03:36,958
Sure.

1471
01:03:37,041 --> 01:03:42,958
And, um, I don't quite know
how to broach the subject.

1472
01:03:43,041 --> 01:03:48,833
But is, um, your husband...
Is he still with us?

1473
01:03:49,500 --> 01:03:53,250
Yeah. I can't believe it.
I mean, he's so old.

1474
01:03:53,333 --> 01:03:55,833
How... How old is he?

1475
01:03:55,916 --> 01:03:57,916
We never talk about it.

1476
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:00,125
Somewhere between 50 and 100.

1477
01:04:01,791 --> 01:04:02,916
Really.

1478
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:07,291
Yeah. Yeah. But... Okay,
let me focus for a second.

1479
01:04:07,375 --> 01:04:09,791
I'm worried about Anna,
all right?

1480
01:04:09,875 --> 01:04:11,291
She's been being weird
with me,

1481
01:04:11,375 --> 01:04:14,500
and she keeps asking
if I ever think about her.

1482
01:04:14,583 --> 01:04:17,291
You know,
maybe she is reconsidering.

1483
01:04:17,375 --> 01:04:19,458
- Reconsidering?
- Uh-huh.

1484
01:04:19,541 --> 01:04:22,875
Three weeks ago, she told me
how in love she is with Eric.

1485
01:04:22,958 --> 01:04:25,458
Do you know that
she wrote a song about you?

1486
01:04:26,958 --> 01:04:28,083
- No.
- Anna!

1487
01:04:29,416 --> 01:04:30,875
Daughter.

1488
01:04:30,958 --> 01:04:33,875
Why don't you tell Jake
about the song you wrote?

1489
01:04:34,583 --> 01:04:35,916
I wrote a song about us.

1490
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:37,583
You know what,
I'll give you your privacy.

1491
01:04:37,666 --> 01:04:40,083
I'm just gonna go look for
music for old people.

1492
01:04:40,166 --> 01:04:42,583
You know, really old,
like Coldplay.

1493
01:04:43,375 --> 01:04:45,166
It's nice to hear
you're writing again.

1494
01:04:45,250 --> 01:04:47,291
Yeah, can you just give me
a second, bro?

1495
01:04:47,375 --> 01:04:48,750
Just one second.

1496
01:04:49,583 --> 01:04:51,416
Coldplay...

1497
01:04:51,500 --> 01:04:53,666
We need to get to the
immigration interview. Now.

1498
01:04:53,750 --> 01:04:55,375
- Okay, let's go.
- Yeah.

1499
01:04:55,875 --> 01:04:57,625
Oh! My legs are so weak,

1500
01:04:57,708 --> 01:04:59,666
my knees are cracking
like walnuts.

1501
01:05:05,375 --> 01:05:06,875
What is happening right now?

1502
01:05:07,500 --> 01:05:10,250
My brain is telling my body
to stand up,

1503
01:05:10,333 --> 01:05:12,708
but it's like shouting into
the abyss.

1504
01:05:14,458 --> 01:05:16,166
See?
I just tried to get up again.

1505
01:05:16,250 --> 01:05:17,125
Okay.

1506
01:05:17,208 --> 01:05:19,000
- Help me. Help me up.
- Okay.

1507
01:05:19,083 --> 01:05:20,875
We have to find a way to get
to the immigration interview.

1508
01:05:20,958 --> 01:05:21,833
- Okay.
- Yes.

1509
01:05:21,916 --> 01:05:24,750
Wait, I have an idea. Come on.

1510
01:05:24,833 --> 01:05:26,416
So, that's why Tess
and I have a special bond.

1511
01:05:26,500 --> 01:05:29,750
Oh, Jake. Hi.
Could we borrow your car?

1512
01:05:29,833 --> 01:05:33,541
Oh, and don't worry,
we're totally of age to drive.

1513
01:05:33,625 --> 01:05:36,208
Anything for you, Dr. C.

1514
01:05:38,708 --> 01:05:39,625
You ready?

1515
01:05:40,583 --> 01:05:41,833
Hold on.

1516
01:05:44,875 --> 01:05:45,958
Whoo!

1517
01:05:48,250 --> 01:05:50,041
Oh, that's a woman
after my heart.

1518
01:05:50,125 --> 01:05:52,583
- I love driving!
- I don't wanna--

1519
01:05:52,666 --> 01:05:54,916
I don't know who taught you
how to drive

1520
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:57,375
but they weren't good.

1521
01:06:00,125 --> 01:06:02,041
Wrong side! Wrong side!
Wrong side!

1522
01:06:02,791 --> 01:06:05,125
- Okay.
- You're gonna get us killed!

1523
01:06:05,208 --> 01:06:06,958
Oh, geez.

1524
01:06:10,625 --> 01:06:12,333
Oh! I can't look.
I can't look.

1525
01:06:12,958 --> 01:06:14,333
No, no.
I'm a very good driver.

1526
01:06:29,166 --> 01:06:31,250
That was smashing.

1527
01:06:34,416 --> 01:06:35,916
Whoo!

1528
01:06:42,458 --> 01:06:44,375
Oh!

1529
01:06:44,458 --> 01:06:45,291
Hi.

1530
01:06:45,875 --> 01:06:48,208
Hi. Nice car.

1531
01:06:48,291 --> 01:06:49,541
It's totally mine.

1532
01:06:49,625 --> 01:06:51,708
- You think he's cute.
- I do not.

1533
01:06:51,791 --> 01:06:53,375
- You totally do.
- Stop. I do not.

1534
01:06:53,458 --> 01:06:55,541
- Yes, you do. You do.
- I do not. Shut up.

1535
01:06:55,625 --> 01:06:56,458
She thinks you're cute!

1536
01:06:56,541 --> 01:06:57,375
I do not!

1537
01:06:57,458 --> 01:06:58,333
- Yes, she does.
- I do.

1538
01:06:58,416 --> 01:06:59,875
- She so does.
- I do.

1539
01:07:00,375 --> 01:07:01,625
Thanks.

1540
01:07:01,708 --> 01:07:02,916
Dr. Coleman?

1541
01:07:03,750 --> 01:07:05,083
Oh, my gosh. Go.

1542
01:07:05,833 --> 01:07:07,333
That's my therapist!

1543
01:07:07,416 --> 01:07:09,541
You nervous?

1544
01:07:09,625 --> 01:07:11,958
Oh, why would I be?
We're perfect for each other.

1545
01:07:12,041 --> 01:07:13,041
You'll see.

1546
01:07:13,625 --> 01:07:15,500
Oh, that's cryptic.

1547
01:07:15,583 --> 01:07:17,291
Coleman/Reyes?

1548
01:07:17,375 --> 01:07:19,583
- Ah, yes. That's us.
- Go.

1549
01:07:20,791 --> 01:07:21,833
My love.

1550
01:07:23,083 --> 01:07:24,333
- So many ruffles.
- Yeah.

1551
01:07:25,916 --> 01:07:27,625
- There we go.
- Ah.

1552
01:07:28,958 --> 01:07:30,125
How are you?

1553
01:07:30,208 --> 01:07:33,125
Oh, um, I was just dumped
by my fiancé, so...

1554
01:07:33,208 --> 01:07:34,625
- You know.
- Oh, no.

1555
01:07:34,708 --> 01:07:36,833
I... I'm so sorry.

1556
01:07:36,916 --> 01:07:39,541
Oh, what a decent thing
to say. Thank you.

1557
01:07:39,625 --> 01:07:40,458
Yes, of course.

1558
01:07:40,541 --> 01:07:42,458
Are you single?

1559
01:07:42,541 --> 01:07:43,875
Kidding!

1560
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:47,125
Um, can I see your paperwork?

1561
01:07:47,208 --> 01:07:48,416
- Ah, yes.
- Yeah.

1562
01:07:48,500 --> 01:07:49,541
I'm sure you're approved.

1563
01:07:49,625 --> 01:07:50,500
Wait. Whoa.

1564
01:07:50,583 --> 01:07:52,375
Don't you need to see
if we really know each other?

1565
01:07:52,458 --> 01:07:53,458
I mean, usually, yeah,

1566
01:07:53,541 --> 01:07:58,083
but he seems like
such a kind and honest man

1567
01:07:58,166 --> 01:07:59,541
who clearly works out.

1568
01:07:59,625 --> 01:08:00,916
- Oh.
- A lot.

1569
01:08:01,541 --> 01:08:02,833
I mean you could be a gymnast.

1570
01:08:02,916 --> 01:08:04,666
I did once qualify
to represent the UK

1571
01:08:04,750 --> 01:08:06,125
- in pole vaulting.
- You're kidding. Really?

1572
01:08:06,208 --> 01:08:07,416
I'd still like for us
to prove

1573
01:08:07,500 --> 01:08:09,958
that we, you know,
are marriage material.

1574
01:08:10,666 --> 01:08:13,625
So, what's my favorite
road trip snack?

1575
01:08:13,708 --> 01:08:16,541
Uh, 7-Eleven hot dog
dipped in blue Slurpee.

1576
01:08:16,625 --> 01:08:17,875
Dream vacay?

1577
01:08:17,958 --> 01:08:19,458
Taking the girls
to the Galapagos.

1578
01:08:19,541 --> 01:08:21,875
Harper would love
the biodiversity

1579
01:08:21,958 --> 01:08:24,083
and I think Lily could
really benefit from the dirt.

1580
01:08:24,166 --> 01:08:27,083
Though she really
just wants to see a, uh...

1581
01:08:27,166 --> 01:08:29,666
Komodo dragon in the wild.

1582
01:08:29,750 --> 01:08:31,250
It's her favorite animal.

1583
01:08:31,333 --> 01:08:33,291
These are too, too easy.

1584
01:08:33,375 --> 01:08:35,166
You gotta hit me
with the hard stuff.

1585
01:08:35,250 --> 01:08:38,458
What is my guilty pleasure
pump-up song?

1586
01:08:38,541 --> 01:08:39,583
Oh.

1587
01:08:39,666 --> 01:08:43,083
Uh, darling, I promised to
never divulge

1588
01:08:43,166 --> 01:08:44,583
that highly-classified
information.

1589
01:08:44,666 --> 01:08:46,708
See? He doesn't know me.

1590
01:08:46,791 --> 01:08:48,375
- At all. See?
- Okay.

1591
01:08:48,458 --> 01:08:49,666
We can't get married.

1592
01:08:49,750 --> 01:08:52,625
It's...
It's Chumbawamba.

1593
01:08:53,791 --> 01:08:54,708
She told you?

1594
01:08:54,791 --> 01:08:56,666
Wait. "Creepy Crawling"
or "Tubthumping"?

1595

01:09:25,083 --> 01:09:26,875
What's my deepest,
darkest fear?

1606
01:09:26,958 --> 01:09:27,958
Oh.

1607
01:09:28,708 --> 01:09:31,333
That your love for Harper
and need to protect her

1608
01:09:31,416 --> 01:09:33,833
will push her away
rather than bring her close.

1609
01:09:34,625 --> 01:09:36,416
And then she'll run away
and be a surf bum

1610
01:09:36,500 --> 01:09:38,208
and then she'll get
a dodgy tattoo of the sun

1611
01:09:38,291 --> 01:09:39,500
around her belly button.

1612
01:09:41,083 --> 01:09:45,166
But you're a phenomenal mum
and Harper is amazing,

1613
01:09:45,250 --> 01:09:46,958
so that will never happen.

1614
01:09:50,958 --> 01:09:53,125
Well, that was really sweet.

1615
01:09:53,208 --> 01:09:54,750
I didn't know that.

1616
01:09:55,458 --> 01:09:57,125
You know, I approve
hundreds of marriages

1617
01:09:57,208 --> 01:09:59,583
that... ...probably
won't even last a year.

1618
01:10:00,291 --> 01:10:01,625
But you two...

1619
01:10:08,166 --> 01:10:10,125
- Thank you.
- Next.

1620
01:10:12,916 --> 01:10:14,750
Well done. We got approved.

1621
01:10:14,833 --> 01:10:16,083
Ugh.

1622
01:10:16,166 --> 01:10:18,833
Ugh, my seafood vendor says
we canceled.

1623
01:10:18,916 --> 01:10:20,250
- I should deal with this.
- Bet.

1624
01:10:20,333 --> 01:10:22,125
- Yeah, my mom's almost here.
- Okay.

1625
01:10:22,208 --> 01:10:24,291
Uh, bye.

1626
01:10:24,375 --> 01:10:25,208
What an odd mix-up.

1627
01:10:27,666 --> 01:10:29,708
Hop in, muppet. How'd it go?

1628
01:10:29,791 --> 01:10:32,583
Your dad knows a lot
about my mom.

1629
01:10:32,666 --> 01:10:34,458
- I think he really loves her.
- But did you do enough

1630
01:10:34,541 --> 01:10:36,125
to break them up?

1631
01:10:36,208 --> 01:10:37,583
I don't know.

1632
01:10:37,666 --> 01:10:39,291
I need to clear my mind.

1633
01:10:39,375 --> 01:10:42,416
- Can we go somewhere?
- Yes, yeah. Get in.

1634
01:10:42,500 --> 01:10:45,125
- Don't drive so fast.
- Okay. Buckle up!

1635
01:10:47,375 --> 01:10:48,958
"Change the hearts
you know are wrong

1636
01:10:49,041 --> 01:10:50,250
to reach the place
where you belong."

1637
01:10:50,333 --> 01:10:52,166
What do you think
she meant by that?

1638
01:10:52,250 --> 01:10:53,208
I think she made it all up,

1639
01:10:53,291 --> 01:10:54,666
but look on the bright side,
honey,

1640
01:10:54,750 --> 01:10:57,166
these scooters are
so much fun!

1641
01:10:57,250 --> 01:10:58,541
Why have we never
done this before?

1642
01:10:58,625 --> 01:11:00,125
Because you already have
one fake hip

1643
01:11:00,208 --> 01:11:01,583
and you do not need another.

1644
01:11:01,666 --> 01:11:04,208
Very funny. I'll have
you know, in this body,

1645
01:11:04,291 --> 01:11:06,750
I have two real hips.

1646
01:11:08,500 --> 01:11:10,416
Whoa!

1647
01:11:11,333 --> 01:11:13,500
Sorry. Sorry.

1648
01:11:16,041 --> 01:11:17,041
Nothing broke!

1649
01:11:18,833 --> 01:11:19,833
We're invincible!

1650
01:11:19,916 --> 01:11:20,916
Bone density!

1651
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:22,541
I'm not exhausted!

1652
01:11:26,333 --> 01:11:30,833
Girls, get in the car.

1653
01:11:33,083 --> 01:11:35,416
How do kids get away
with anything anymore?

1654
01:11:51,250 --> 01:11:53,791
You know, I hated you
a little less today.

1655
01:11:55,791 --> 01:11:58,375
I think it's hard to hate me
when I look like your gran.

1656
01:11:59,708 --> 01:12:00,708
And...

1657
01:12:02,125 --> 01:12:04,958
I hated you
a little less today too.

1658
01:12:09,875 --> 01:12:13,583
I just don't understand how
anyone can dislike California.

1659
01:12:13,666 --> 01:12:15,083
It's, like, a wrong opinion.

1660
01:12:16,875 --> 01:12:19,041
Harper, you can't have
a wrong opinion.

1661
01:12:19,125 --> 01:12:21,041
I mean, look around.

1662
01:12:21,125 --> 01:12:24,791
Yes. Okay, Harper,
it's lovely.

1663
01:12:24,875 --> 01:12:26,208
It's lovely.

1664
01:12:26,958 --> 01:12:28,000
I just...

1665
01:12:31,750 --> 01:12:33,250
...I miss England.

1666
01:12:39,708 --> 01:12:42,125
We can talk about her
if you want.

1667
01:12:44,833 --> 01:12:45,875
No, thanks.

1668
01:12:48,208 --> 01:12:49,708
I think if I talk about her,

1669
01:12:50,750 --> 01:12:52,708
I'm giving away what little
of her I have left.

1670
01:12:55,166 --> 01:12:56,166
Okay.

1671
01:12:58,166 --> 01:13:03,416
And why are you so obsessed
that I like Los Angeles?

1672
01:13:03,500 --> 01:13:05,416
- Well, I'm not.
- Yes, you are.

1673
01:13:05,500 --> 01:13:06,583
- No.
- Yes.

1674
01:13:07,208 --> 01:13:11,125
And look, even if I liked it
a little bit here, I mean...

1675
01:13:14,625 --> 01:13:17,875
You... You still
don't want me around.

1676
01:13:18,458 --> 01:13:21,000
- Obviously not.
- Obviously not.

1677
01:13:22,333 --> 01:13:24,666
I guess it's a good thing
we're stopping this wedding.

1678
01:13:26,125 --> 01:13:27,125
Yeah.

1679
01:13:29,666 --> 01:13:30,666
Where are they?

1680
01:13:30,750 --> 01:13:31,916
They're supposed to
be home by now.

1681
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:34,750
This is very good.
A little dry.

1682
01:13:35,791 --> 01:13:39,041
Very fruit-forward.
And by fruit, I mean grapes.

1683
01:13:39,833 --> 01:13:42,583
Your lack of concern,
it's not working.

1684
01:13:42,666 --> 01:13:44,291
Just stay calm, honey.

1685
01:13:45,041 --> 01:13:46,125
Stay calm?

1686
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:48,291
But I've got
the rehearsal lunch,

1687
01:13:48,375 --> 01:13:49,583
the final dress fitting,

1688
01:13:49,666 --> 01:13:51,750
and my wedding is in 36 hours,

1689
01:13:51,833 --> 01:13:53,666
and I'm trapped in the body
of a ninth-grader.

1690
01:13:53,750 --> 01:13:54,666
I did.

1691
01:13:54,750 --> 01:13:56,833
- I told you she approved it.
- You most certainly did not.

1692
01:13:56,916 --> 01:13:58,458
What difference
does it make, anyway?

1693
01:13:58,541 --> 01:14:00,291
- It's done now.
- Where on earth have you been?

1694
01:14:01,541 --> 01:14:02,750
- Oh.
- Well.

1695
01:14:02,833 --> 01:14:05,291
Can't two adult women
come home when they please?

1696
01:14:05,375 --> 01:14:06,791
What do you think you're doing
driving around

1697
01:14:06,875 --> 01:14:07,833
like that with Ella all day?

1698
01:14:07,916 --> 01:14:10,250
Ella needs to talk to you,
by the way.

1699
01:14:10,333 --> 01:14:11,583
You need to give her
more attention.

1700
01:14:11,666 --> 01:14:13,083
Why am I dressed like that?

1701
01:14:13,166 --> 01:14:15,000
I need more attention
from you sometimes.

1702
01:14:15,083 --> 01:14:16,416
She has a lot of stuff
to talk to you about.

1703
01:14:16,500 --> 01:14:17,833
She was crying.

1704
01:14:17,916 --> 01:14:19,416
Okay, I don't care
about that right now.

1705
01:14:19,500 --> 01:14:20,958
Did you make it
to the immigration interview?

1706
01:14:21,041 --> 01:14:23,250
Yes, I did.
Just, like, chill, okay?

1707
01:14:23,333 --> 01:14:25,708
Or do your weird
breathing stuff that you do.

1708
01:14:26,250 --> 01:14:27,250
Chill?

1709
01:14:28,833 --> 01:14:30,375
I am the adult here.

1710
01:14:30,458 --> 01:14:32,458
I'm in charge.

1711
01:14:32,541 --> 01:14:33,875
Doesn't look like it.

1712
01:14:33,958 --> 01:14:35,750
You just earned yourselves
a consequence.

1713
01:14:35,833 --> 01:14:38,208
- Ooh. No.
- Oh, no.

1714
01:14:38,291 --> 01:14:39,208
Give me your phones.

1715
01:14:39,291 --> 01:14:40,125
- Sure.
- No.

1716
01:14:40,708 --> 01:14:41,750
Psych.

1717
01:14:41,833 --> 01:14:44,125
By the way, you're the reason
this is all falling apart.

1718
01:14:44,208 --> 01:14:45,416
Shut up. No, I'm not.

1719
01:14:45,500 --> 01:14:47,125
Yes, it totally is.
And don't...

1720
01:14:47,208 --> 01:14:48,916
Girls, this is serious.

1721
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:50,458
We all need to
start getting along

1722
01:14:50,541 --> 01:14:52,291
unless we want to be
stuck like this forever.

1723
01:14:52,375 --> 01:14:55,291
You know, you lot are getting
the better end of this deal.

1724
01:14:55,375 --> 01:14:58,291
It's us who are gonna be dead
in, like, five years.

1725
01:14:58,375 --> 01:14:59,375
She's 37.

1726
01:14:59,458 --> 01:15:01,416
I'm 36 and a half!

1727
01:15:01,500 --> 01:15:03,291
While you two
were out having fun,

1728
01:15:03,375 --> 01:15:04,458
we found Madame Jen.

1729
01:15:04,541 --> 01:15:07,250
And she made us buy
business cards for everyone

1730
01:15:07,333 --> 01:15:08,750
and a Reiki ten-pack!

1731
01:15:08,833 --> 01:15:11,166
What even is Reiki?
Huh? What is it?

1732
01:15:11,250 --> 01:15:12,333
Stop talking about Reiki.

1733
01:15:12,416 --> 01:15:14,750
Well, Madame Jen said
to change your hearts,

1734
01:15:14,833 --> 01:15:16,500
so change
your freaking dang hearts.

1735
01:15:16,583 --> 01:15:18,541
It's the only way for us
to get out of this mess.

1736
01:15:18,625 --> 01:15:20,833
I'm switching to red.
Do you want one?

1737
01:15:20,916 --> 01:15:22,875
You're making Mommy
very stressed!

1738
01:15:22,958 --> 01:15:25,041
...use Reiki now!

01:16:14,750 --> 01:16:17,250
Shredding the waves, dude.

1749
01:16:17,333 --> 01:16:19,708
Never use those words again.

1750
01:16:19,791 --> 01:16:21,833
Wait, what are you doing here?

1751
01:16:21,916 --> 01:16:23,000
Our lessons.

1752
01:16:24,666 --> 01:16:25,916
What lessons?

1753
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:26,958
Surf lessons.

1754
01:16:28,291 --> 01:16:29,291
But it looks like you're ready

1755
01:16:29,375 --> 01:16:31,375
to surprise Harper
and take her out.

1756
01:16:31,458 --> 01:16:34,208
Oh, yeah. That's really gonna
surprise Harper.

1757
01:16:34,833 --> 01:16:36,166
Obviously.

1758
01:16:36,250 --> 01:16:38,583
Oh, no, I just ate
a bowl of onions.

1759
01:16:38,666 --> 01:16:39,791
In the water?

1760
01:16:40,416 --> 01:16:41,416
Yeah, they keep me alert.

1761
01:16:44,083 --> 01:16:45,166
Okay.

1762
01:16:47,375 --> 01:16:51,083
Look, I know it feels like

1763
01:16:51,166 --> 01:16:53,875
we're in
an impossible situation.

1764
01:16:54,583 --> 01:16:57,583
Maybe that's why things have
felt a bit off with us.

1765
01:16:58,583 --> 01:16:59,916
Yeah, probably.

1766
01:17:00,625 --> 01:17:03,041
Yeah, but Anna...

1767
01:17:05,208 --> 01:17:09,083
I think we should stay in LA.

1768
01:17:11,125 --> 01:17:12,125
What about Lily?

1769
01:17:14,458 --> 01:17:16,625
Going back to London,
to Pembridge Hall,

1770
01:17:16,708 --> 01:17:18,208
it's not going to
bring back her mum.

1771
01:17:19,208 --> 01:17:22,541
And there's no one
keeping us there anymore.

1772
01:17:23,375 --> 01:17:26,333
If I'm honest,
we've felt so lost.

1773
01:17:27,250 --> 01:17:29,541
So what she needs is
to be with family.

1774
01:17:30,375 --> 01:17:34,166
A gran like Tess,
a sister like Harper, and you.

1775
01:17:41,375 --> 01:17:42,250
What is it?

1776
01:17:42,791 --> 01:17:43,791
It's just...

1777
01:17:44,833 --> 01:17:48,333
I can't believe how much
you love me and my family.

1778
01:17:49,291 --> 01:17:53,291
It's a real, true love.
It's just... It's crazy.

1779
01:17:54,041 --> 01:17:56,625
Okay. Well,
you made it look so easy.

1780
01:17:57,333 --> 01:17:58,333
I'm gonna give it a go.

1781
01:17:59,208 --> 01:18:00,291
I don't know if that's--

1782
01:18:00,375 --> 01:18:01,750
Maybe I've improved
as much as you!

1783
01:18:05,041 --> 01:18:06,083
Oh!

1784
01:18:06,166 --> 01:18:07,750
I'm okay!

1785
01:18:08,375 --> 01:18:09,375
Oh.

1786
01:18:11,291 --> 01:18:12,916
No. I'm gonna wait.

1787
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:14,541
I'm gonna wait
for the instructor.

1788
01:18:15,208 --> 01:18:16,833
I mean, you were amazing.

1789
01:18:16,916 --> 01:18:18,500
You were, like,
weaving and dodging,

1790
01:18:18,583 --> 01:18:20,208
and you're like a pro surfer.

1791
01:18:21,041 --> 01:18:22,958
- I'm glad we talked.
- Yeah, me too.

1792
01:18:24,208 --> 01:18:25,791
It's good we came to
a decision.

1793
01:18:25,875 --> 01:18:27,333
Yeah, dude.
Really good.

1794
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:29,208
See you at
the rehearsal lunch!

1795
01:18:29,291 --> 01:18:31,875
Totally,
but my mom said I have to...

1796
01:18:35,291 --> 01:18:37,250
It fits perfectly.
Anna, come look.

1797
01:18:37,333 --> 01:18:38,791
Oh, wow.

1798
01:18:40,500 --> 01:18:44,625
Sweetheart...
...fix your posture.

1799
01:18:45,625 --> 01:18:46,625
This is weird.

1800
01:18:47,708 --> 01:18:49,666
Weirder for me, trust me.

1801
01:18:49,750 --> 01:18:50,958
Really? Are you the one

1802
01:18:51,041 --> 01:18:52,375
wearing your mom's
wedding dress?

1803
01:18:52,458 --> 01:18:55,375
Well, I never thought I'd get
to have this experience.

1804
01:18:55,458 --> 01:18:56,875
Especially like this.

1805
01:18:57,750 --> 01:19:00,333
Well, Mom, you know how
much I love to wear a dress.

1806
01:19:00,416 --> 01:19:03,208
Ugh. Sorry this
is such a mess, Harper.

1807
01:19:03,291 --> 01:19:05,500
Mom, there's something
I need to tell you.

1808
01:19:11,250 --> 01:19:13,916
What were you talking to
my dad about this morning?

1809
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:16,708
Oh, we were just talking
about the lunch.

1810
01:19:17,708 --> 01:19:18,916
What about the lunch?

1811
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:20,083
Just lunch stuff.

1812
01:19:24,416 --> 01:19:27,291
Oh, right. The lunch.

1813
01:19:29,458 --> 01:19:31,458
Okay. Um.

1814
01:19:32,750 --> 01:19:34,750
I'm just gonna make
a quick call.

1815
01:19:34,833 --> 01:19:35,833
Okay.

1816
01:19:35,916 --> 01:19:36,916
Okay.

1817
01:19:52,333 --> 01:19:55,708
Oh, hi! It's Tess.

1818
01:19:55,791 --> 01:20:00,125
Um, listen, last minute
but Anna was wondering

1819
01:20:00,208 --> 01:20:03,333
if you might like to attend
her rehearsal luncheon.

1820
01:20:04,666 --> 01:20:08,041
No, no. You would not be
an imposition. You know what?

1821
01:20:08,125 --> 01:20:09,250
I think your appearance there

1822
01:20:09,333 --> 01:20:11,541
would make it
a much more lively affair.

1823
01:20:15,291 --> 01:20:18,375
<i>So, I just wanted to</i>
<i>say that I'm very excited.</i>

1824
01:20:18,458 --> 01:20:21,208
<i>And being at my new restaurant</i>
<i>makes it all the more special</i>

1825
01:20:21,291 --> 01:20:23,791
for all of us to finally
come together as a family.

1826
01:20:23,875 --> 01:20:26,833
So with that said,
welcome to Lily's.

1827
01:20:26,916 --> 01:20:27,916
Congratulations.

1828
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:28,875
Thank you for coming.

1829
01:20:28,958 --> 01:20:30,833
Really, Eric and I
so appreciate it.

1830
01:20:30,916 --> 01:20:32,000
Oh.

1831
01:20:32,666 --> 01:20:33,666
Right. Thanks.

1832
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:35,875
Champagne, ladies?

1833
01:20:35,958 --> 01:20:37,000
- Yes, please.
- Yes, please.

1834
01:20:37,083 --> 01:20:38,416
- 'Cause we're adults.
- Mm-hmm.

1835
01:20:38,500 --> 01:20:41,916
Girls, Eric's parents are here
so best behavior, please.

1836
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:43,833
Stand up straight.
Good posture.

1837
01:20:43,916 --> 01:20:48,916
Anna, my soon-to-be daughter.
My heart is so full.

1838
01:20:49,000 --> 01:20:50,416
That's me.

1839
01:20:51,166 --> 01:20:52,166
How was your flight?

1840
01:20:52,250 --> 01:20:55,625
Oh, it was 13 hours and
30 minutes from Manila. Ugh.

1841
01:20:55,708 --> 01:20:56,875
Major jet lag.

1842
01:20:56,958 --> 01:20:58,791
Some worse than others.

1843
01:20:58,875 --> 01:21:02,333
But I really love it here.

1844
01:21:02,416 --> 01:21:03,916
Maybe Harper can
teach me the surf.

1845
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:06,250
- Sure, dude.
- <i>Mano po, Lola</i>.

1846
01:21:07,708 --> 01:21:10,541
You're so silly.
Only Lily calls me Lola.

1847
01:21:10,625 --> 01:21:13,250
But I want to support
your Tagalog learning.

1848
01:21:13,333 --> 01:21:14,708
Keep it up.

1849
01:21:14,791 --> 01:21:15,708
Come on, Anna.

1850
01:21:15,791 --> 01:21:17,250
- Let's have a drink.
- No, no, no, no. We just...

1851
01:21:17,333 --> 01:21:19,208
We have to wait for
the surprise guest.

1852
01:21:19,791 --> 01:21:20,916
What are you talking about?

1853
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:22,625
Oh, just wait.

1854
01:21:22,708 --> 01:21:26,041
- Hello, sir. Welcome.
- Ah, no, thank you.

1855
01:21:26,125 --> 01:21:27,666
- I'm here to see someone.
- Jake?

1856
01:21:28,375 --> 01:21:29,666
Just alone or...

1857
01:21:29,750 --> 01:21:30,791
What's he doing here?

1858
01:21:30,875 --> 01:21:32,541
I invited him
but I didn't think he'd come.

1859
01:21:32,625 --> 01:21:34,666
But, you know,
he really likes your gran.

1860
01:21:34,750 --> 01:21:36,208
My mom's gonna freak out,

1861
01:21:36,291 --> 01:21:37,541
- you know that?
- I know. So will my dad.

1862
01:21:37,625 --> 01:21:40,250
- That was the whole point.
- You...

1863
01:21:40,333 --> 01:21:44,500
Dr. C. Thank you
for inviting me.

1864
01:21:44,583 --> 01:21:47,250
I... I saved your number.
I hope that's okay.

1865
01:21:47,333 --> 01:21:48,916
Of course.

1866
01:21:49,666 --> 01:21:50,916
- Hi, there.
- Hey.

1867
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:53,125
Hmm. I think I'm gonna
have to ask you to leave.

1868
01:21:53,208 --> 01:21:55,125
Uh, now?

1869
01:21:55,208 --> 01:21:58,291
But, uh, you know, your mom,
she really wanted me here.

1870
01:21:58,375 --> 01:22:01,083
Right. I'm sure.
Well...

1871
01:22:05,041 --> 01:22:06,041
Okay.

1872
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:08,666
- I got you.
- Thank you so much.

1873
01:22:08,750 --> 01:22:10,416
- No, no, no. Wait.
- You're the best, bro.

1874
01:22:10,500 --> 01:22:11,375
- Wait!
- Thank goodness.

1875
01:22:11,458 --> 01:22:12,666
I will be right back.

1876
01:22:12,750 --> 01:22:14,708
- No. Jake, don't go.
- Ah, Tess. Tess.

1877
01:22:14,791 --> 01:22:16,458
- Yes?
- Uh, can we have a chat later?

1878
01:22:16,541 --> 01:22:18,333
- It's regarding Lily.
- Oh!

1879
01:22:18,416 --> 01:22:20,708
If it's regarding Lily,
we should chat now.

1880
01:22:20,791 --> 01:22:21,916
My big sister, Anna.

1881
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:24,666
After every atomic wedgie
you gave me,

1882
01:22:24,750 --> 01:22:27,833
I always knew that you
also had an atomic heart.

1883
01:22:27,916 --> 01:22:29,208
- Cheers.
- Cheers!

1884
01:22:29,291 --> 01:22:32,375
Anna and I decided
we should all stay in LA.

1885
01:22:34,083 --> 01:22:34,916
What?

1886
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:36,500
- Yes.
- What?

1887
01:22:36,583 --> 01:22:37,583
Everyone?

1888
01:22:37,666 --> 01:22:39,250
Yes.

1889
01:22:39,333 --> 01:22:40,541
As a therapist,

1890
01:22:40,625 --> 01:22:42,291
I was hoping to
get your thoughts

1891
01:22:42,375 --> 01:22:43,916
on the best way to
approach it with Lily.

1892
01:22:46,375 --> 01:22:48,083
But, I know how you feel
about billable hours

1893
01:22:48,166 --> 01:22:50,208
so we can chat later. Yeah?

1894
01:22:50,291 --> 01:22:51,666
Okay. Okay.

1895
01:23:00,208 --> 01:23:03,916
You bloody backstabber.
I know what you did.

1896
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:04,875
- Shh!
- All right,

1897
01:23:04,958 --> 01:23:06,000
who wants to speak next?

1898
01:23:06,083 --> 01:23:07,666
Father of the groom
looks ready.

1899
01:23:07,750 --> 01:23:10,291
No, no. I have a few
choice words for the bride.

1900
01:23:10,375 --> 01:23:12,000
I would like to make a toast.

1901
01:23:12,083 --> 01:23:13,083
That's crystal.

1902
01:23:13,166 --> 01:23:14,875
Uh, we have
a toasting triangle.

1903
01:23:14,958 --> 01:23:16,333
- Oh, piss off.
- Okay.

1904
01:23:17,166 --> 01:23:19,916
I would like to make a toast
to your future husband

1905
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:23,125
so that he knows
what kind of woman

1906
01:23:23,208 --> 01:23:24,583
he is getting married to.

1907
01:23:24,666 --> 01:23:27,583
He does, he does, he does.

1908
01:23:27,666 --> 01:23:29,208
He knows who he's marrying

1909
01:23:29,291 --> 01:23:30,833
and he can make
his own decisions

1910
01:23:30,916 --> 01:23:33,500
and he knows not to be
manipulated by other people.

1911
01:23:33,583 --> 01:23:34,791
Tess.

1912
01:23:34,875 --> 01:23:37,416
Hey, gramps,
this is between us.

1913
01:23:37,500 --> 01:23:38,750
Listen to your husband.

1914
01:23:38,833 --> 01:23:41,125
You listen to me.

1915
01:23:41,208 --> 01:23:42,833
{\an8}Ugh, Ella. What does she want?

1916
01:23:43,416 --> 01:23:45,666
Micro cilantro
from the foothills of Oaxaca.

1917
01:23:45,750 --> 01:23:47,083
It was not my fault.

1918
01:23:47,625 --> 01:23:50,625
That micro cilantro
is bursting with flavor.

1919
01:23:50,708 --> 01:23:51,875
But it is your fault

1920
01:23:51,958 --> 01:23:55,458
that the cilantro
has no loyalty to...

1921
01:23:55,541 --> 01:23:57,833
- What are they doing?
- We have to stop them.

1922
01:23:57,916 --> 01:23:59,375
Are you doing all right, Harp?

1923
01:24:00,125 --> 01:24:02,458
Ella, this is
the last thing I need.

1924
01:24:02,541 --> 01:24:03,666
Oh, Jake's back already.

1925
01:24:03,750 --> 01:24:04,791
Jake? Who?

1926
01:24:04,875 --> 01:24:06,833
Jake, what...
What are you doing here?

1927
01:24:06,916 --> 01:24:08,583
- Uh...
- It was all her, I swear.

1928
01:24:08,666 --> 01:24:10,583
Hello. Um, and you are?

1929
01:24:10,666 --> 01:24:12,583
That's Anna's ex-boyfriend.

1930
01:24:12,666 --> 01:24:15,250
- What? Why?
- She invited her ex-boyfriend?

1931
01:24:15,333 --> 01:24:16,250
What?

1932
01:24:16,333 --> 01:24:17,833
Because she still
has feelings for him.

1933
01:24:17,916 --> 01:24:19,666
- Okay. That's not-- That...
- No.

1934
01:24:19,750 --> 01:24:21,458
- What? I...
- No. Uh...

1935
01:24:21,541 --> 01:24:22,958
After the appetizer,

1936
01:24:23,041 --> 01:24:24,750
Anna said she wasn't
feeling well so I went--

1937
01:24:24,833 --> 01:24:26,208
Right. I wasn't feeling well.

1938
01:24:27,333 --> 01:24:28,583
Okay, but not from
the food here.

1939
01:24:28,666 --> 01:24:29,791
The food is fine.

1940
01:24:29,875 --> 01:24:31,541
- Too fishy. No.
- It's fish.

1941
01:24:31,625 --> 01:24:33,458
It is not the food.

1942
01:24:33,541 --> 01:24:35,875
She's just on her period.
That's all.

1943
01:24:35,958 --> 01:24:37,291
She's on her period.

1944
01:24:38,416 --> 01:24:39,458
I'm on mine right now.

1945
01:24:39,541 --> 01:24:40,500
- I got it.
- I didn't know where

1946
01:24:40,583 --> 01:24:41,916
- you are in your cycle...
- I know, dude.

1947
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:42,958
It's fine. Thanks.

1948
01:24:43,041 --> 01:24:44,500
Can someone please
explain to me

1949
01:24:44,583 --> 01:24:46,208
- what's going on here.
- I don't know.

1950
01:24:46,291 --> 01:24:48,000
- Let's just tell the truth.
- Don't let her.

1951
01:24:48,083 --> 01:24:50,625
She shouldn't explain anything
because she will just lie.

1952
01:24:50,708 --> 01:24:52,041
- Hey, me?
- She lies.

1953
01:24:52,125 --> 01:24:54,291
- Yeah.
- I trusted you.

1954
01:24:54,375 --> 01:24:57,000
I know, but you don't know
what he said to me.

1955
01:24:57,083 --> 01:24:58,708
You weren't there.
You didn't hear it.

1956
01:24:59,750 --> 01:25:02,208
I don't think
this marriage should happen.

1957
01:25:02,291 --> 01:25:05,041
Well, you know what? It's not
just about what you want.

1958
01:25:05,125 --> 01:25:06,708
It's about what she wants
and she wants--

1959
01:25:06,791 --> 01:25:08,041
It isn't ever about
what I want.

1960
01:25:08,125 --> 01:25:09,791
- It's always about you.
- That's enough.

1961
01:25:09,875 --> 01:25:11,083
Does everyone want this?

1962
01:25:11,166 --> 01:25:12,250
Okay, that's enough.

1963
01:25:12,333 --> 01:25:13,458
Well, yes. Some of them do.

1964
01:25:13,541 --> 01:25:15,000
Hey, that's enough!

1965
01:25:19,291 --> 01:25:21,708
The girls fighting
is one thing

1966
01:25:21,791 --> 01:25:22,916
but this is your mum.

1967
01:25:23,708 --> 01:25:26,208
And for some reason,
your ex-boyfriend is here.

1968
01:25:27,458 --> 01:25:28,291
Yeah.

1969
01:25:28,375 --> 01:25:30,875
Anna, I love you

1970
01:25:31,416 --> 01:25:33,750
but you're clearly
having second thoughts.

1971
01:25:36,208 --> 01:25:38,458
This isn't working
for our families,

1972
01:25:38,541 --> 01:25:41,333
and we always said
we'd put our families first.

1973
01:25:42,458 --> 01:25:43,458
So...

1974
01:25:47,041 --> 01:25:48,041
We can't do this.

1975
01:25:50,625 --> 01:25:52,041
I can't do this.

1976
01:25:54,416 --> 01:25:57,375
Lily, help your grandparents.
I'll meet you at the valet.

1977
01:25:58,291 --> 01:25:59,291
The wedding's off.

1978
01:26:01,166 --> 01:26:03,041
He's right.
It's over.

1979
01:26:03,833 --> 01:26:04,833
Wait, no.

1980
01:26:06,041 --> 01:26:07,208
Wait, please, please, please.

1981
01:26:07,291 --> 01:26:08,125
No.

1982
01:26:08,208 --> 01:26:09,583
I'm so sorry. I promise,

1983
01:26:09,666 --> 01:26:11,083
I didn't mean for this
to happen.

1984
01:26:13,375 --> 01:26:14,541
I think you did.

1985
01:26:20,208 --> 01:26:21,208
Well.

1986
01:26:24,791 --> 01:26:27,791
- I guess we did it.
- Yeah.

1987
01:26:34,875 --> 01:26:35,958
Uh...

1988
01:26:36,041 --> 01:26:37,833
I know this isn't
the best time

1989
01:26:37,916 --> 01:26:40,250
but can I have my car back?

1990
01:26:45,833 --> 01:26:47,041
Maybe later.

1991
01:27:05,708 --> 01:27:06,708
Mom!

1992
01:27:09,583 --> 01:27:10,916
She seems upset.

1993
01:27:11,791 --> 01:27:13,458
No, she just needs some space.

1994
01:27:17,833 --> 01:27:20,708
What about you?
Are you doing okay?

1995
01:27:21,416 --> 01:27:23,250
Oh, yeah. I'm always okay.

1996
01:27:25,291 --> 01:27:27,083
It would be fair
if you weren't.

1997
01:27:28,083 --> 01:27:30,666
That all got pretty crazy.

1998
01:27:33,750 --> 01:27:35,458
I worry what will happen

1999
01:27:35,541 --> 01:27:38,208
when Tess doesn't have
those two to drive her crazy.

2000
01:27:40,416 --> 01:27:42,083
You're worried about her?

2001
01:27:45,333 --> 01:27:47,291
I'm worried Tess would be
really lonely

2002
01:27:47,958 --> 01:27:49,666
if all of you moved to London.

2003
01:27:52,041 --> 01:27:53,833
You're a good guy, Ryan.

2004
01:27:56,000 --> 01:27:57,708
Thank you.

2005
01:27:58,625 --> 01:28:00,083
Go on.

2006
01:28:00,166 --> 01:28:02,000
Maybe this isn't
for me to fix.

2007
01:28:10,250 --> 01:28:11,750
Mind if I join you?

2008
01:28:15,333 --> 01:28:17,041
- Okay.
- Okay.

2009
01:28:21,416 --> 01:28:22,458
Are you okay?

2010
01:28:25,666 --> 01:28:27,708
I haven't seen my dad
that upset...

2011
01:28:30,708 --> 01:28:31,958
since my mum died.

2012
01:28:35,958 --> 01:28:37,333
And it was all my fault.

2013
01:28:39,791 --> 01:28:44,041
You know, when Ryan asked me
to marry him,

2014
01:28:45,875 --> 01:28:47,500
I thought a lot about

2015
01:28:47,583 --> 01:28:49,541
what Anna and Harry's dad
would have said.

2016
01:28:51,833 --> 01:28:53,333
How he would have felt
about it.

2017
01:28:54,916 --> 01:28:57,166
I think he'd be
so happy for us.

2018
01:28:59,125 --> 01:29:03,208
That we found someone
who loved us all so much.

2019
01:29:13,416 --> 01:29:15,125
I think my mum
would feel the same way.

2020
01:29:15,208 --> 01:29:16,416
Yeah.

2021
01:29:17,666 --> 01:29:21,750
- I really miss her.
- I know. It's okay.

2022
01:29:21,833 --> 01:29:23,583
She would be
so disappointed in me.

2023
01:29:23,666 --> 01:29:25,916
- No, no, no.
- Yes, she would.

2024
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:29,000
Because I was very selfish.
I was.

2025
01:29:29,083 --> 01:29:30,041
No.

2026
01:29:30,125 --> 01:29:32,833
I was, and I know it.

2027
01:29:33,916 --> 01:29:38,250
No, she'd know your heart.

2028
01:29:41,916 --> 01:29:43,500
I just... I should...

2029
01:29:43,583 --> 01:29:45,291
- Find my dad...
- Yeah.

2030
01:29:46,708 --> 01:29:48,125
...and-- and apologize.

2031
01:29:56,500 --> 01:29:59,291
<i>Ella, Ella, Ella.</i>

2032
01:29:59,375 --> 01:30:01,833
Ella, Ella, Ella.

2033
01:30:01,916 --> 01:30:04,500
Ella, Ella, Ella.

2034
01:30:04,583 --> 01:30:07,250
Ella, Ella, Ella.

2035
01:30:07,791 --> 01:30:10,083
Why are you
walking so fast?

2036
01:30:10,166 --> 01:30:11,666
I can't walk as fast as you.

2037
01:30:11,750 --> 01:30:13,583
Ella keeps texting me
the word "urgent,"

2038
01:30:13,666 --> 01:30:15,041
and her show starts,
like, now.

2039
01:30:15,125 --> 01:30:16,000
But what about Eric?

2040
01:30:16,083 --> 01:30:17,291
I think we should
go back, Mom.

2041
01:30:17,375 --> 01:30:19,166
I thought there was a way
to make everyone happy

2042
01:30:19,250 --> 01:30:20,625
but there's not, all right?

2043
01:30:20,708 --> 01:30:22,291
But I think that we should
go back for Eric.

2044
01:30:22,375 --> 01:30:24,708
- I really should--
- Come on. My client needs me.

2045
01:30:24,791 --> 01:30:26,125
Ella, Ella, Ella.

2046
01:30:26,208 --> 01:30:28,958

01:31:28,458 --> 01:31:29,291
I--

2074
01:31:29,375 --> 01:31:30,416
And that you told her
she could do

2075
01:31:30,500 --> 01:31:31,541
any song she wanted to.

2076
01:31:32,500 --> 01:31:33,625
You did?

2077
01:31:33,708 --> 01:31:36,125
Dressing room is right around
the corner. Put this on.

2078
01:31:36,208 --> 01:31:37,041
Why?

2079
01:31:37,125 --> 01:31:38,750
Well, because
we're not 15 anymore.

2080
01:31:38,833 --> 01:31:39,750
Dolphins.

2081
01:31:39,833 --> 01:31:40,958
- Get in there. Okay.
- What?

2082
01:31:41,041 --> 01:31:42,541
- Let me know when she's ready.
- Crazy.

2083
01:31:42,625 --> 01:31:43,875
I can't believe
you're making me do this.

2084
01:31:43,958 --> 01:31:45,416
Don't make fun of my dress.

01:31:56,416 --> 01:31:58,083
This is all my fault.

2090
01:31:58,166 --> 01:32:00,416
Lily and I tried to sabotage
you and Eric.

2091
01:32:01,375 --> 01:32:03,875
And I tried to make him
fall out of love with you,

2092
01:32:03,958 --> 01:32:07,541
but I couldn't because
he loves you so much.

2093
01:32:07,625 --> 01:32:10,583
And Mom, you shouldn't
have to give that up for me.

2094
01:32:10,666 --> 01:32:13,208
Just like you gave up
being a rock star.

2095
01:32:13,916 --> 01:32:14,916
And I know you've been

2096
01:32:15,000 --> 01:32:17,083
secretly writing songs
in private.

2097
01:32:17,666 --> 01:32:19,000
What?

2098
01:32:19,083 --> 01:32:21,416
You know, the one about Jake.

2099
01:32:21,958 --> 01:32:23,625
What are you talking about?

2100
01:32:24,416 --> 01:32:26,000
"I'm your good
and I'm your bad

2101
01:32:26,083 --> 01:32:27,333
'cause you're my baby.

2102
01:32:27,416 --> 01:32:29,208
And love was made to last."

2103
01:32:29,291 --> 01:32:30,291
Huh?

2104
01:32:32,458 --> 01:32:36,708
Harper, that song is not
about Jake.

2105
01:32:37,291 --> 01:32:39,375
That song is about you.

2106
01:32:39,458 --> 01:32:40,541
About me?

2107
01:32:40,625 --> 01:32:42,375
Of course it is...

2108
01:32:42,958 --> 01:32:44,208
Harp.

2109
01:32:44,916 --> 01:32:46,541
Mom, I'm sorry that I said

2110
01:32:46,625 --> 01:32:48,875
I wanted to stay
with Grams if you left.

2111
01:32:48,958 --> 01:32:50,125
I'm sorry.

2112
01:32:50,208 --> 01:32:53,041
I'm so sorry that I made you
think that you had to choose

2113
01:32:53,125 --> 01:32:56,708
between being together
or being at home.

2114
01:32:57,875 --> 01:32:59,750
I choose you every time.

2115
01:33:01,333 --> 01:33:02,500
Okay.

2116
01:33:02,583 --> 01:33:04,541
We gotta go.
Look, we look like a grown-up.

2117
01:33:04,625 --> 01:33:06,791
- Let's go, let's go.
- Where am I going now?

2118
01:33:07,583 --> 01:33:09,000
If you'll excuse me,
I have to go get Lily.

2119
01:33:09,083 --> 01:33:10,541
No, no, no, no. Please.

2120
01:33:10,625 --> 01:33:13,791
I know I said I didn't want
this wedding to go on,

2121
01:33:13,875 --> 01:33:15,416
but-but that's not true.

2122
01:33:15,500 --> 01:33:16,958
It's just not.

2123
01:33:17,041 --> 01:33:18,041
I...

2124
01:33:18,958 --> 01:33:20,666
I was scared.

2125
01:33:20,750 --> 01:33:23,708
And... and I think I realized

2126
01:33:23,791 --> 01:33:27,041
that I didn't wanna
share someone I love.

2127
01:33:27,125 --> 01:33:28,833
I appreciate that, Tess.
I do--

2128
01:33:28,916 --> 01:33:30,416
But... But wait. But please.

2129
01:33:30,500 --> 01:33:31,916
You still love Anna.

2130
01:33:32,000 --> 01:33:33,541
You still wanna get married.

2131
01:33:33,625 --> 01:33:34,833
- I--
- Do you?

2132
01:33:34,916 --> 01:33:35,958
- I--
- Do you love her?

2133
01:33:36,041 --> 01:33:36,875
I love Anna.

2134
01:33:36,958 --> 01:33:39,458
- Do you wanna marry her?
- I wanna marry Anna.

2135
01:33:39,541 --> 01:33:41,833
- But then what?
- But it's not about me!

2136
01:33:43,500 --> 01:33:46,750
Lily is the most important
person in my life.

2137
01:33:46,833 --> 01:33:49,791
And I worry every day
I'm messing up as a parent.

2138
01:33:49,875 --> 01:33:51,958
Okay? I am on my own.

2139
01:33:52,041 --> 01:33:55,625
I lost her mum, and I am
so scared of losing her.

2140
01:33:57,750 --> 01:33:59,333
So I have to put her first.

2141
01:34:01,208 --> 01:34:03,000
What if you were
right all along?

2142
01:34:04,250 --> 01:34:07,833
What if being here
with the Colemans

2143
01:34:07,916 --> 01:34:10,541
is exactly what she needs?

2144
01:34:11,958 --> 01:34:13,541
I thought so too.

2145
01:34:14,250 --> 01:34:15,708
But after all this,

2146
01:34:17,041 --> 01:34:18,416
I'm not sure.

2147
01:34:20,333 --> 01:34:21,416
I am.

2148
01:34:38,875 --> 01:34:40,416
I love you so much!

2149
01:34:40,500 --> 01:34:44,041
I have a little surprise guest
for you.

2150
01:34:44,125 --> 01:34:47,875
Give it up for one of
my favorite bands, Pink Slip!

2151
01:34:50,958 --> 01:34:53,416
No. Why are you guys
doing this to me?

2152
01:34:53,500 --> 01:34:55,166
- You all right?
- No, no, no.

2153
01:34:55,250 --> 01:34:57,208
No, Mom. I don't know
how to play guitar.

2154
01:34:57,291 --> 01:34:58,750
- It's all right, okay? I do.
- I can't. No.

2155
01:34:58,833 --> 01:35:01,583
This is a bad idea. No, no.

2156
01:35:01,666 --> 01:35:03,541
- Harper! Harper, go!
- No. No. No.

2157
01:35:03,625 --> 01:35:05,000
Pink Slip! Pink Slip!

2158
01:35:05,083 --> 01:35:07,500
Pink Slip! Pink Slip!
Pink Slip!

2159
01:35:08,041 --> 01:35:12,083
My friend is gonna be singing
her brand-new song tonight!

2160
01:35:14,375 --> 01:35:16,750
- Anna.
- Mom, you suck.

2161
01:35:30,708 --> 01:35:32,416
- Anna.
- Huh?

2162
01:35:32,500 --> 01:35:33,666
- What are you doing?
- Oh.

2163
01:35:35,333 --> 01:35:36,375
Oh.

2164
01:35:37,333 --> 01:35:39,208
- Go like this.
- Like what?

2165
01:35:39,291 --> 01:35:40,333
Mm-mmm.

2166
01:35:44,333 --> 01:35:45,833
- You got this.
- Okay.

2167
01:35:47,375 --> 01:35:48,708
- Yes.
- No.

2168
01:35:48,791 --> 01:35:50,250
Mm-mmm. No.

2169
01:35:50,333 --> 01:35:51,583
Yes, you can.

2170
01:36:02,375 --> 01:36:03,750
Do you know what?
Wait. Can we--

2171
01:36:03,833 --> 01:36:05,958
Can we just...
Can we stop for a second?

2172
01:36:06,666 --> 01:36:08,458
Sorry. I just...

2173
01:36:08,541 --> 01:36:11,958
I wanna bring out the person
that I wrote this song for.

2174
01:36:12,500 --> 01:36:16,083
She means everything to me,
and I love her so much.

2175
01:36:16,166 --> 01:36:19,250
I know that family
isn't always easy,

2176
01:36:19,333 --> 01:36:21,333
but family is everything.

2177
01:36:21,416 --> 01:36:24,875
She also plays guitar
way better than me.

2178
01:36:24,958 --> 01:36:28,291
So please welcome
my daughter, Harper.

2179
01:36:50,083 --> 01:36:52,916
Ready to do this? Together?

2180
01:36:53,833 --> 01:36:54,958

01:40:09,625 --> 01:40:11,375
Are you okay?

01:40:11,458 --> 01:40:12,458
Yeah.

2227
01:40:24,750 --> 01:40:25,833
You sure?

2228
01:40:25,916 --> 01:40:27,666
Uh-huh.

2229
01:40:27,750 --> 01:40:29,708
Okay. All right. Let's just...

2230
01:40:29,791 --> 01:40:31,041
That's better.

2231
01:40:31,125 --> 01:40:32,250
Okay.

2232
01:40:32,333 --> 01:40:34,291
Thank you, Los Angeles.

2233
01:40:34,375 --> 01:40:37,291
And Eric, if you're out there
and you'll still have me,

2234
01:40:37,375 --> 01:40:39,125
I can't wait to marry you.

2235
01:40:40,541 --> 01:40:43,541
I can't wait to marry you too!

2236
01:40:43,625 --> 01:40:44,750
What?

2237
01:40:45,583 --> 01:40:47,208
I said yes!

2238
01:40:48,291 --> 01:40:51,125
Okay, well, whatever that was,
just get him up here.

2239
01:40:51,208 --> 01:40:54,250
Excuse me.
Pardon me. Excuse me.

2240
01:40:57,750 --> 01:40:59,083
Did you know
