1
00:00:21,731 --> 00:00:22,732
Baby, I'm sorry.

2
00:00:25,234 --> 00:00:28,613
I didn't... I was
holding... Like this.

3
00:00:28,696 --> 00:00:32,158
I was holding your hand.
I was holding your hand.

4
00:00:32,241 --> 00:00:33,785
And I'm still...

5
00:00:33,868 --> 00:00:37,121
I'm looking and looking
and looking. I'm looking.

6
00:00:37,204 --> 00:00:39,582
I'm looking for my perfect...
for my perfectly...

7
00:00:39,665 --> 00:00:41,417
My perf... ection.

8
00:00:41,917 --> 00:00:44,879
Yes. All of it. All of it!

9
00:00:45,921 --> 00:00:47,256
You don't believe me.

10
00:00:47,339 --> 00:00:49,342
'Cause I asked you to help. Yes!

11
00:00:49,425 --> 00:00:52,637
But you're in your box.
Your little precious box.

12
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:54,472
Your little box of... mud.

13
00:00:54,555 --> 00:00:57,600
You think it's yours.
You think you did it.

14
00:01:00,352 --> 00:01:02,772
What about I take
the... lights out?

15
00:01:02,855 --> 00:01:07,110
The rights out, tights
out, fiiiights out!

16
00:01:07,193 --> 00:01:10,653
What now? Huh? Bitch.
You think I'm locked out.

17
00:01:11,989 --> 00:01:16,577
I'm the one inside.
And I'll spit you out.

18
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:19,663
I am the first and the last.

19
00:01:20,289 --> 00:01:22,750
I will make you a million
dollars in one day.

20
00:01:22,833 --> 00:01:25,545
And all you got to do is give
me your face and your eyes

21
00:01:25,628 --> 00:01:27,963
and your liiife-blood!

22
00:01:28,589 --> 00:01:30,174
The Devil's gonna get
you rich in two minutes

23
00:01:30,257 --> 00:01:33,010
if you just... Jaaackpot!

24
00:01:33,093 --> 00:01:36,722
A flipped up, tipped
up, tiiick-tock.

25
00:01:37,223 --> 00:01:40,476
I've got my tripped up God-cock.

26
00:01:40,893 --> 00:01:43,062
More wicked boxes.

27
00:01:43,604 --> 00:01:45,398
And I know who set 'em here.

28
00:01:45,481 --> 00:01:47,191
I will show my
will to all of you

29
00:01:47,274 --> 00:01:50,361
that smile with
the pride of pigs.

30
00:01:50,444 --> 00:01:53,531
And all the pigs will
listen when it's too late.

31
00:01:53,614 --> 00:01:57,660
The pigs and liars will burn
forever when it's too late.

32
00:01:57,743 --> 00:02:00,913
And all your boxes
will be saaand.

33
00:02:00,996 --> 00:02:03,332
We're going to be talking
about what happens

34
00:02:03,415 --> 00:02:05,168
if you are ready to have a baby,

35
00:02:05,251 --> 00:02:08,337
but your partner, your spouse,
your significant other,

36
00:02:08,420 --> 00:02:10,423
is not ready to have a baby.

37
00:02:10,506 --> 00:02:13,217
That can be a really
difficult place to be in.

38
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:14,552
And it can actually be a lot

39
00:02:14,635 --> 00:02:16,304
of dealbreakers
for relationships.

40
00:02:16,387 --> 00:02:17,889
Especially when one person

41
00:02:17,972 --> 00:02:19,807
really does want
to start a family.

42
00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:21,100
And that's what they wanted

43
00:02:21,183 --> 00:02:23,811
from day one of their
life and they know that.

44
00:02:23,894 --> 00:02:25,979
And then maybe the other
person just isn't ready yet

45
00:02:27,439 --> 00:02:29,799
...or really just doesn't want
children or can't see them...

46
00:02:40,661 --> 00:02:41,661
What's this?

47
00:02:42,371 --> 00:02:43,371
Can I help you?

48
00:02:46,292 --> 00:02:47,460
What's that mask for?

49
00:02:47,543 --> 00:02:49,253
You didn't see the signs
coming into our village

50
00:02:49,336 --> 00:02:51,130
of our rules and
regulations, Sheriff?

51
00:02:51,213 --> 00:02:52,757
This is Pueblo.

52
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:53,925
No, it's not.

53
00:02:54,008 --> 00:02:56,093
I was just at a residence
right back there.

54
00:02:56,176 --> 00:02:58,512
That is Sevilla County.

55
00:02:59,179 --> 00:03:00,932
That may be,

56
00:03:01,015 --> 00:03:03,810
but the border is there.
This is Santa Lupe.

57
00:03:03,893 --> 00:03:04,811
You don't ever come

58
00:03:04,894 --> 00:03:06,437
when we ask for
your help, Sheriff.

59
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:08,230
-You're trespassing.
-Butterfly!

60
00:03:10,316 --> 00:03:11,796
People are dying of
this thing, right?

61
00:03:13,068 --> 00:03:14,278
-People are dying.
-Now, look.

62
00:03:14,361 --> 00:03:16,822
This one here, he's got it
hanging off of his nose.

63
00:03:17,489 --> 00:03:20,868
I mean, what are we doing
here? Listen. Just...

64
00:03:20,951 --> 00:03:23,203
I am listening. Shut up!

65
00:03:23,787 --> 00:03:26,248
When you're on our
soil, put on your mask.

66
00:03:30,336 --> 00:03:33,339
Put on your mask, Sheriff.

67
00:03:43,223 --> 00:03:46,684
Hey, you don't have to...

68
00:03:47,728 --> 00:03:49,939
0-1, to all monitoring units.

69
00:03:50,022 --> 00:03:52,816
Got a call into the office
advising about a disturbance.

70
00:04:04,787 --> 00:04:07,123
0-8, 0-4.

71
00:04:07,206 --> 00:04:11,043
Hi, Sheriff. It's another
disorderly conduct with Lodge.

72
00:04:11,126 --> 00:04:13,128
But I was gonna see
where Tooley's at.

73
00:04:15,589 --> 00:04:18,593
Uh, no, I'll take it.

74
00:04:18,676 --> 00:04:21,553
Ten-four. Uh, you sure?
It's at the mayor's.

75
00:04:29,603 --> 00:04:30,603
Sheriff?

76
00:04:31,730 --> 00:04:34,442
I heard you. Well,
what does that mean?

77
00:04:34,525 --> 00:04:37,069
Is it his office,
his house, the bar?

78
00:04:38,946 --> 00:04:42,116
Bar. But I was gonna check
what Tooley's twenty was.

79
00:04:46,662 --> 00:04:47,705
No, I'll take it.

80
00:05:19,278 --> 00:05:20,571
Blonde bitches named Sarah

81
00:05:20,654 --> 00:05:22,198
think they're Rosa Parks.

82
00:05:22,281 --> 00:05:24,199
If I added her on
Snap, what would I say?

83
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:26,535
Uh, take a pic of you with me.

84
00:05:26,952 --> 00:05:28,454
Prove that you're an ally.

85
00:05:28,829 --> 00:05:29,955
No, but really.

86
00:05:30,706 --> 00:05:31,874
I don't know. Send
her a dick pic.

87
00:05:31,957 --> 00:05:33,625
See if she can guess what it is.

88
00:05:37,838 --> 00:05:39,505
-What do I do?
-I don't know.

89
00:05:45,304 --> 00:05:47,765
Bro, no mask?

90
00:05:47,848 --> 00:05:49,850
No, I'm good. Bro.

91
00:05:51,643 --> 00:05:54,605
What's that smell, by
the way? A little reefer?

92
00:05:54,688 --> 00:05:56,064
I don't know. Your ass?

93
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:01,779
And then, just the spillover.

94
00:06:01,862 --> 00:06:03,948
Two, three hundred
construction jobs, ongoing.

95
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:05,950
The solar offset's a
whole 'nother development.

96
00:06:06,033 --> 00:06:07,326
Sure, sure. But, what?

97
00:06:07,409 --> 00:06:08,577
We just let these
guys build this,

98
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:10,162
whatever it is, data complex

99
00:06:10,245 --> 00:06:11,372
and then they up
and close it down

100
00:06:11,455 --> 00:06:12,623
for whatever reason? We
just got to eat that?

101
00:06:12,706 --> 00:06:14,458
Phil, there's clawbacks
on everything.

102
00:06:14,541 --> 00:06:16,919
Gross receipt taxes,
payback of property.

103
00:06:17,002 --> 00:06:18,796
There's no wishing tech away.

104
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:22,008
Whether we jump on the
boat now or get bulldozed,

105
00:06:22,091 --> 00:06:24,677
these guys, they're bringing
an actual infrastructure

106
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:26,137
for a real future.

107
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:28,014
-A real future.
-That's right.

108
00:06:28,097 --> 00:06:29,555
Can we count on
your "yay" tomorrow?

109
00:06:32,017 --> 00:06:33,476
What is the problem?

110
00:06:37,731 --> 00:06:40,275
Well, he... he's outside.

111
00:06:41,068 --> 00:06:42,903
I had to lock the door
to keep him outside.

112
00:06:42,986 --> 00:06:44,864
It's been a whole
hour like this.

113
00:06:44,947 --> 00:06:46,657
I can't understand you.

114
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:47,740
Yes, you can.

115
00:06:52,121 --> 00:06:54,248
He's disturbing
the peace. Again.

116
00:06:54,331 --> 00:06:55,874
He's blocking the entrance.

117
00:06:56,542 --> 00:06:59,462
Whose entrance? What are
you even doing in there?

118
00:06:59,545 --> 00:07:01,005
It's takeaway drinks only.

119
00:07:01,088 --> 00:07:03,716
Those are town council members.
That's essential business.

120
00:07:03,799 --> 00:07:04,842
Well, you can't just call

121
00:07:04,925 --> 00:07:06,302
essential business
whatever you want.

122
00:07:06,385 --> 00:07:07,511
It's a city council meeting

123
00:07:07,594 --> 00:07:09,847
wherever city council
people congregate.

124
00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:12,016
It's the Mayor's
office if I'm inside.

125
00:07:12,099 --> 00:07:14,226
Okay, then you are open.

126
00:07:14,309 --> 00:07:15,978
And you have a
paying customer...

127
00:07:16,061 --> 00:07:17,480
Customer?

128
00:07:17,563 --> 00:07:19,982
He's aggressive, he's dangerous,
he needs to be locked up.

129
00:07:20,065 --> 00:07:21,358
Where would you
have me send him?

130
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:22,359
These are your streets...

131
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:23,360
No, they're your
streets, Sheriff.

132
00:07:23,443 --> 00:07:24,403
...that you locked down.

133
00:07:24,486 --> 00:07:25,738
They're your streets
to keep safe.

134
00:07:25,821 --> 00:07:27,198
And where is your mask?

135
00:07:27,281 --> 00:07:29,074
I don't...

136
00:07:29,658 --> 00:07:31,785
He doesn't have a mask on!

137
00:07:32,536 --> 00:07:34,455
-All right.
-He's coughing!

138
00:07:34,538 --> 00:07:35,539
Okay.

139
00:07:36,165 --> 00:07:38,042
-No mask either with this guy?
-All right.

140
00:07:38,125 --> 00:07:41,628
Hey.

141
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:15,621
You get your little Instagram?

142
00:08:15,704 --> 00:08:17,706
Yeah, I got my little Instagram.

143
00:08:32,512 --> 00:08:34,140
Again, history repeats itself.

144
00:08:34,223 --> 00:08:37,143
And, uh, I mean,
let's talk about 1956.

145
00:08:37,226 --> 00:08:39,645
Let's talk about the number
56 for just one minute.

146
00:08:39,728 --> 00:08:43,065
In California, you have
Jesuit-educated Gavin Newsom.

147
00:08:43,398 --> 00:08:44,650
And he said to California,

148
00:08:44,733 --> 00:08:47,736
as he became the first governor
to lock down his state,

149
00:08:47,819 --> 00:08:51,282
he said, "56% of you will
get Corona in eight weeks."

150
00:08:51,365 --> 00:08:53,492
Which is exactly 56 days.

151
00:08:53,575 --> 00:08:56,620
Of course, they keep looking
at that lab in Wuhan, China.

152
00:08:56,703 --> 00:08:58,455
And if you look at
that lab in Wuhan

153
00:08:58,538 --> 00:09:01,625
when it was established,
it was 1956.

154
00:09:01,708 --> 00:09:03,961
Of course, that's the
year Tom Hanks was born,

155
00:09:04,044 --> 00:09:05,379
the first celebrity
with the virus.

156
00:09:05,462 --> 00:09:06,964
Mr. Sleepless In Seattle.

157
00:09:07,047 --> 00:09:09,175
By the way, Jenny Durkan
was the mayor of Seattle

158
00:09:09,258 --> 00:09:12,887
when it became the first city
in the world outside of China

159
00:09:12,970 --> 00:09:16,307
to have someone get the virus.
And she was the 56th mayor.

160
00:09:16,390 --> 00:09:17,516
This is Gematria.

161
00:09:17,599 --> 00:09:19,226
Ancient practice of
coding numbers into words.

162
00:09:19,309 --> 00:09:20,309
It's a simp...

163
00:09:25,732 --> 00:09:28,694
How many coincidences
need to occur

164
00:09:28,777 --> 00:09:31,363
before we call this
pattern a design?

165
00:09:31,446 --> 00:09:34,825
I-Is the end goal of media
the end of mediation?

166
00:09:34,908 --> 00:09:36,368
We are here on this plane,

167
00:09:36,451 --> 00:09:38,204
somehow, as these things...

168
00:09:38,287 --> 00:09:39,622
-Hey.
-Hey.

169
00:09:39,705 --> 00:09:41,165
How was your day?

170
00:09:41,248 --> 00:09:42,248
Good.

171
00:09:42,666 --> 00:09:43,751
How was yours?

172
00:09:43,834 --> 00:09:46,086
Good. I got those for you.

173
00:09:46,712 --> 00:09:47,963
Yeah, I'm all right.

174
00:09:51,091 --> 00:09:52,134
Something happen to you?

175
00:09:53,427 --> 00:09:54,345
What do you mean?

176
00:09:54,428 --> 00:09:55,428
Your limp.

177
00:09:56,471 --> 00:09:58,181
-Oh.
-Hurt your leg?

178
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:01,018
Just some...

179
00:10:01,101 --> 00:10:04,813
...stupid nonsense
down at, um... the bar.

180
00:10:06,815 --> 00:10:07,983
Not... Not with Ted.

181
00:10:08,066 --> 00:10:11,111
Just, you know, Lodge.
You know, the homeless?

182
00:10:12,612 --> 00:10:13,821
It wasn't Ted.

183
00:10:17,868 --> 00:10:18,910
Whoa.

184
00:10:19,286 --> 00:10:20,746
What's this one about?

185
00:10:22,247 --> 00:10:24,791
Yeah, just an image
I had. I don't know.

186
00:10:25,459 --> 00:10:28,128
Very weird. I like it.

187
00:10:30,547 --> 00:10:32,716
I sold two more
of the new dolls.

188
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:33,799
Really?

189
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:35,634
Which ones?

190
00:10:36,428 --> 00:10:38,013
The spider legs

191
00:10:38,597 --> 00:10:42,017
and the girl sleeping
on the tongue.

192
00:10:42,768 --> 00:10:45,562
Uh-huh. Well, that is
great news, Louise.

193
00:10:53,612 --> 00:10:56,407
Wha... She can't
just email this, huh?

194
00:10:56,490 --> 00:10:57,783
Well, she does

195
00:10:57,866 --> 00:11:00,494
and then she checks my phone
to see if I opened them.

196
00:11:00,577 --> 00:11:01,787
Yeah, well, that's
why I told you

197
00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:03,538
you should put a passcode on.

198
00:11:04,498 --> 00:11:07,751
I did put a passcode
on last week.

199
00:11:12,464 --> 00:11:16,969
Hey, you remember the
deal when she moved in?

200
00:11:17,052 --> 00:11:18,929
That it was just
'til... 'til April?

201
00:11:20,972 --> 00:11:22,766
You remember there's
still a pandemic?

202
00:11:25,727 --> 00:11:27,145
I don't like it either.

203
00:11:28,063 --> 00:11:29,815
She took my work space.

204
00:11:32,359 --> 00:11:33,861
I mean, if she was an invalid,

205
00:11:33,944 --> 00:11:36,113
that'd be one thing, but...

206
00:11:36,196 --> 00:11:38,698
You know, even you
said it feels like, uh,

207
00:11:39,074 --> 00:11:41,118
she's watching you all the time.

208
00:11:41,201 --> 00:11:44,163
No, I said it's like I'm
being watched all the time.

209
00:11:44,246 --> 00:11:45,330
Not just by her.

210
00:11:48,208 --> 00:11:50,168
I-I know it feels that way,

211
00:11:51,253 --> 00:11:52,254
but it's not.

212
00:11:53,213 --> 00:11:55,090
I promise. Hey, look at me.

213
00:11:55,424 --> 00:11:57,426
I promise. Okay?

214
00:12:29,583 --> 00:12:30,501
I'm sorry.

215
00:12:30,584 --> 00:12:32,169
-No, no.
-I'm sorry.

216
00:12:32,252 --> 00:12:34,213
-Oh, I'm sorry, darling.
-No, no.

217
00:12:34,296 --> 00:12:37,883
Hey, you don't...
Don't apologize.

218
00:12:38,842 --> 00:12:40,177
-Okay?
-Okay.

219
00:12:41,511 --> 00:12:43,053
I love you, baby.

220
00:12:49,603 --> 00:12:50,979
I am getting better.

221
00:12:52,772 --> 00:12:53,857
I know you are.

222
00:12:54,608 --> 00:12:55,608
I know.

223
00:13:07,037 --> 00:13:08,747
No truth can be verified.

224
00:13:08,830 --> 00:13:13,001
There is no truth on the
level that you and me live at.

225
00:13:13,919 --> 00:13:15,921
Please, ask yourself why
are we using Zoom now?

226
00:13:16,004 --> 00:13:17,005
What even is it?

227
00:13:18,006 --> 00:13:19,425
And it appears right
at the same time

228
00:13:19,508 --> 00:13:21,510
as deepfake and lockdown.

229
00:13:23,803 --> 00:13:25,679
So why are you on
the computer, then?

230
00:13:26,765 --> 00:13:28,767
-Iron's what kills people.
-Morning.

231
00:13:30,435 --> 00:13:31,561
Hey, Dawn,

232
00:13:32,187 --> 00:13:34,064
the hot water got
all used up again.

233
00:13:34,147 --> 00:13:36,316
Did you hear about
this? Clade X?

234
00:13:37,067 --> 00:13:38,235
Mmm.

235
00:13:38,318 --> 00:13:41,405
In 2018. This is not a
secret. Please look it up.

236
00:13:41,488 --> 00:13:44,074
They did a whole
pandemic-modeling exercise

237
00:13:44,157 --> 00:13:45,909
at Johns Hopkins. Now...

238
00:13:45,992 --> 00:13:47,536
How do you simulate a pandemic

239
00:13:47,619 --> 00:13:49,663
two years before a
pandemic even happens?

240
00:13:49,746 --> 00:13:51,957
Please ask yourselves that.

241
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:53,040
How'd you sleep?

242
00:13:54,501 --> 00:13:56,086
I'm out of sleeping pills again.

243
00:13:56,169 --> 00:13:57,254
Thank you.

244
00:13:57,337 --> 00:13:59,798
-Okay. I'll pick some up later.
-Okay.

245
00:13:59,881 --> 00:14:00,799
Why do I even talk?

246
00:14:00,882 --> 00:14:03,093
I'm just an old
lady who's crazy.

247
00:14:03,176 --> 00:14:04,511
-Who's lost her mind.
-Mom?

248
00:14:05,845 --> 00:14:07,055
What were you saying?

249
00:14:11,768 --> 00:14:13,061
I don't have to say it.

250
00:14:13,853 --> 00:14:15,730
You can read it. Here.

251
00:14:20,569 --> 00:14:21,569
Look at this.

252
00:14:22,404 --> 00:14:24,239
Pandemic Modeling Exercise.

253
00:14:24,322 --> 00:14:26,200
Event 201. This
is from last year.

254
00:14:26,283 --> 00:14:28,076
Read it. Out loud.

255
00:14:28,159 --> 00:14:29,953
Please. Out loud.

256
00:14:30,036 --> 00:14:33,373
"Prepare the government, health
officials and business people..."

257
00:14:33,456 --> 00:14:34,583
Business people.
That's interesting.

258
00:14:34,666 --> 00:14:38,170
"For the breakout of an
unprecedented coronavirus."

259
00:14:38,253 --> 00:14:41,131
Coronavirus. They used
that word in 2019.

260
00:14:42,882 --> 00:14:44,676
You need to get your
own laptop, Dawn.

261
00:14:44,759 --> 00:14:46,970
Your daddy was up
against all these things.

262
00:14:47,053 --> 00:14:48,305
The corruption.

263
00:14:48,388 --> 00:14:49,848
It was just more buried.

264
00:14:51,725 --> 00:14:53,976
What, you don't think he was?

265
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:02,652
You were at Ted
Garcia's last night.

266
00:15:03,987 --> 00:15:06,114
It was his complaint, right?

267
00:15:06,531 --> 00:15:07,531
Right?

268
00:15:08,199 --> 00:15:10,118
He rings his little bell,
and you come running.

269
00:15:11,453 --> 00:15:13,789
The fact that you can
just stroll on over there,

270
00:15:13,872 --> 00:15:15,457
business as usual.

271
00:15:16,207 --> 00:15:17,292
What do you all even
say to each other

272
00:15:17,375 --> 00:15:18,376
when you get there?

273
00:15:18,793 --> 00:15:20,170
"Hi. How are ya?"

274
00:15:20,712 --> 00:15:21,712
Mom.

275
00:15:21,963 --> 00:15:23,715
Where even is your anger, Joe?

276
00:15:23,798 --> 00:15:26,468
That's my question.
Where's your anger, Lou?

277
00:15:27,177 --> 00:15:28,303
Hello?!

278
00:15:28,928 --> 00:15:31,473
This, this is how Ted Garcia
gets away with everything.

279
00:15:31,556 --> 00:15:33,267
When I think about what
your daddy would have done

280
00:15:33,350 --> 00:15:34,517
if he was still sheriff...

281
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:36,019
There are more reported cases

282
00:15:36,102 --> 00:15:37,354
in New Mexico prisons

283
00:15:37,437 --> 00:15:39,398
than in all but four
counties in the entire state.

284
00:15:39,481 --> 00:15:41,733
Only McKinley, San
Juan, Bernalillo,

285
00:15:41,816 --> 00:15:43,235
and Doña Ana have more,

286
00:15:43,318 --> 00:15:46,446
yet these counts are dumped
into the state totals every day!

287
00:15:46,529 --> 00:15:48,365
Why? They're in a prison!

288
00:15:48,448 --> 00:15:50,033
I would love to
hear the rationale

289
00:15:50,116 --> 00:15:52,411
of why a restaurant in Hobbs
has to go out of business

290
00:15:52,494 --> 00:15:53,704
to fight a disease
in the Navajo nation.

291
00:15:53,787 --> 00:15:54,787
Whoa.

292
00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:00,836
Hey! Hey!

293
00:16:00,919 --> 00:16:03,129
What is going on here? Fred!

294
00:16:04,422 --> 00:16:06,174
He can't go in without
a mask, Sheriff.

295
00:16:06,257 --> 00:16:07,217
Says who?

296
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:08,677
You can't handle him like that.

297
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:10,303
All right? Get
your hands off him.

298
00:16:11,638 --> 00:16:13,390
-All right, let him in.
-I can't breathe in a mask.

299
00:16:13,473 --> 00:16:16,685
It's a mandate, Sheriff.
Isn't it? Since last week?

300
00:16:20,772 --> 00:16:22,857
There's a way to do it.

301
00:16:23,316 --> 00:16:24,984
There's a way to treat people.

302
00:16:26,569 --> 00:16:27,696
Just let him in.

303
00:16:32,826 --> 00:16:33,827
What?

304
00:16:34,494 --> 00:16:36,830
He can't breathe in his mask.
You want him to starve too?

305
00:16:37,789 --> 00:16:38,957
I can't neither.

306
00:17:47,108 --> 00:17:48,318
No. No.

307
00:17:48,401 --> 00:17:49,401
Out!

308
00:17:50,111 --> 00:17:51,196
-Get out.
-What is this?

309
00:17:51,738 --> 00:17:52,739
I have groceries.

310
00:17:52,822 --> 00:17:54,365
-I haven't checked out yet.
-Out!

311
00:17:54,991 --> 00:17:56,493
Come on, Fred.

312
00:17:56,576 --> 00:17:57,953
-Wait a minute.
-I'm sorry.

313
00:17:58,036 --> 00:17:59,454
You're welcome back any
time wearing a mask.

314
00:17:59,537 --> 00:18:01,832
Why are you doing this?
I can't breathe in it.

315
00:18:01,915 --> 00:18:02,999
That's much worse

316
00:18:03,082 --> 00:18:04,501
when you have to wait in
line for a ventilator.

317
00:18:04,584 --> 00:18:05,836
I can't breathe in the mask.

318
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:07,086
Get out!

319
00:18:18,223 --> 00:18:19,725
-Excuse me, Sheriff.
-Yeah.

320
00:18:19,808 --> 00:18:22,728
I'm sorry, but you need a mask
if you're going to be in here.

321
00:18:22,811 --> 00:18:25,230
It's okay.

322
00:18:25,313 --> 00:18:27,023
I-I don't.

323
00:18:27,106 --> 00:18:28,400
But...

324
00:18:28,483 --> 00:18:30,485
I'm sorry, but you're just not
going to treat people like that.

325
00:18:30,568 --> 00:18:33,697
-Joe, what...
-I can't.

326
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:35,282
Sheriff, I...

327
00:18:35,365 --> 00:18:37,033
-There's a mandate. I have to...
-Hey, Joe.

328
00:18:37,116 --> 00:18:38,118
It doesn't... doesn't matter.

329
00:18:38,201 --> 00:18:39,744
Hey.

330
00:18:40,245 --> 00:18:41,245
Good morning.

331
00:18:41,579 --> 00:18:42,579
Hey, Tony.

332
00:18:43,498 --> 00:18:44,498
How we doing?

333
00:18:44,958 --> 00:18:46,626
Okay, Mayor. I think.

334
00:18:46,709 --> 00:18:48,545
We're... We're fine.

335
00:18:49,254 --> 00:18:50,974
Well, that's good.
That's good. That's good.

336
00:18:52,215 --> 00:18:53,215
Listen,

337
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:54,800
Joe,

338
00:18:55,468 --> 00:18:56,468
you know,

339
00:18:59,305 --> 00:19:01,224
if a healthy person
with a mask...

340
00:19:01,307 --> 00:19:03,435
Oh, here we go. Mm-hmm.

341
00:19:03,518 --> 00:19:06,229
...gets exposed to
a Covid-19 person...

342
00:19:06,312 --> 00:19:07,564
-Uh-huh.
-...without a mask...

343
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:08,732
Yeah. Yeah.

344
00:19:08,815 --> 00:19:10,984
...then they got a 70%
chance of catching it.

345
00:19:12,277 --> 00:19:13,445
But if we all wear them,

346
00:19:13,528 --> 00:19:15,530
then we can reduce the
transmission to 1.5%.

347
00:19:15,613 --> 00:19:17,574
You don't even know what
you're talking about.

348
00:19:17,657 --> 00:19:20,744
1.4% of nothing is what?

349
00:19:20,827 --> 00:19:23,371
And actually, Joe,
this is simple because

350
00:19:23,830 --> 00:19:25,623
there is a state mandate.

351
00:19:26,291 --> 00:19:28,835
No, that's... It's
not enforceable.

352
00:19:28,918 --> 00:19:30,211
It is enforceable.

353
00:19:30,837 --> 00:19:32,922
It absolutely is enforceable.

354
00:19:33,548 --> 00:19:35,634
Made so by the Governor and
the Department of Health.

355
00:19:35,717 --> 00:19:37,260
You just gonna keep filming?

356
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:40,347
Is that... You
getting it? Uh-huh.

357
00:19:40,430 --> 00:19:42,641
What the Mayor's talking
about... Hello, sir.

358
00:19:42,724 --> 00:19:45,352
The Mayor's talking
about policy. Okay?

359
00:19:45,435 --> 00:19:48,605
If you don't want me
in here without a mask,

360
00:19:48,688 --> 00:19:50,607
you must change the law.

361
00:19:50,690 --> 00:19:53,234
County commissioners are
right here in Eddington.

362
00:19:53,568 --> 00:19:54,945
Put it on the agenda.

363
00:19:55,028 --> 00:19:56,655
Get a county ordinance

364
00:19:56,738 --> 00:19:59,741
prohibiting me, and
Fred, and the rest of us

365
00:19:59,824 --> 00:20:02,828
that want to live our
lives without a mask...

366
00:20:02,911 --> 00:20:05,288
Would you... Would you
put that... Excuse me.

367
00:20:05,705 --> 00:20:08,249
Excuse me! Is that Fred's?

368
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:09,834
Put it down.

369
00:20:10,543 --> 00:20:11,543
Joe.

370
00:20:17,091 --> 00:20:19,969
I-I-I just...

371
00:20:20,762 --> 00:20:21,762
Okay.

372
00:20:22,931 --> 00:20:23,931
Okay.

373
00:20:25,725 --> 00:20:27,143
Go on. Go.

374
00:20:27,226 --> 00:20:28,645
What? What?

375
00:20:28,728 --> 00:20:29,729
Everything's fine.

376
00:20:30,146 --> 00:20:31,146
Okay?

377
00:20:35,276 --> 00:20:36,569
You know who this is for?

378
00:20:43,785 --> 00:20:45,078
Fred, come on,

379
00:20:45,161 --> 00:20:46,663
before you get hit by a car.

380
00:20:47,413 --> 00:20:48,832
-All right, now listen to me.
-Yes, sir.

381
00:20:48,915 --> 00:20:50,292
I want you to take this.

382
00:20:50,375 --> 00:20:51,501
What is this? What is this?

383
00:20:51,584 --> 00:20:53,336
It's for you. You have
yourself a good day. Okay?

384
00:20:53,419 --> 00:20:54,838
Wait, wait. Can I pay
you back for this?

385
00:20:54,921 --> 00:20:56,047
No, no, no.

386
00:20:56,130 --> 00:20:58,132
Uh, Sheriff, Sheriff.
Wait, wait, wait. Please.

387
00:20:58,883 --> 00:21:01,010
A picture. A picture?

388
00:21:01,636 --> 00:21:02,636
Okay.

389
00:21:05,306 --> 00:21:08,518
-Ready?
-Hold on. Hold on.

390
00:21:08,601 --> 00:21:09,601
Smile.

391
00:21:35,753 --> 00:21:37,547
Ladies and gentlemen,
what have you,

392
00:21:37,630 --> 00:21:40,759
this is Joe Cross,
sheriff of Sevilla County.

393
00:21:40,842 --> 00:21:44,721
And, first off, allow me
to say that I'm asthmatic.

394
00:21:44,804 --> 00:21:46,181
I know. Who cares?

395
00:21:46,264 --> 00:21:50,685
But I do find it very difficult
to breathe in these masks. Okay?

396
00:21:50,768 --> 00:21:54,856
Now, second off, there
is no Covid in Eddington.

397
00:21:54,939 --> 00:21:58,360
There's no Covid
in Sevilla County,

398
00:21:58,443 --> 00:22:02,488
yet a state mandate pushed
by our mayor and his governor

399
00:22:02,864 --> 00:22:05,325
says that I cannot shop for food

400
00:22:05,408 --> 00:22:07,452
without risking
an asthma attack.

401
00:22:07,535 --> 00:22:11,665
And you cannot exercise
your freedom of choice

402
00:22:11,748 --> 00:22:16,502
without being, you know,
uh, publicly shamed.

403
00:22:17,170 --> 00:22:18,588
Bec...

404
00:22:18,671 --> 00:22:22,508
Because what I just saw
just... ...a moment ago...

405
00:22:23,342 --> 00:22:26,137
Uh...

406
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:27,305
I mean, I just...

407
00:22:28,306 --> 00:22:29,766
How... How did we get here?

408
00:22:30,558 --> 00:22:33,936
Okay? And even worse,
is it worth it?

409
00:22:34,645 --> 00:22:38,941
Is it worth it to combat a
virus that isn't even here

410
00:22:39,650 --> 00:22:41,944
at the cost of being at
war with your neighbors

411
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:44,072
and your... your family?

412
00:22:45,865 --> 00:22:48,367
Because that... that's what
community is, isn't it?

413
00:22:48,701 --> 00:22:50,578
It's a family. Okay?

414
00:22:51,037 --> 00:22:53,999
Because you can ruin a man's day

415
00:22:54,082 --> 00:22:57,085
or you can do the right
thing and you can be kind,

416
00:22:57,168 --> 00:22:59,003
and you can free his heart.

417
00:23:01,672 --> 00:23:05,051
We need to free
each other's hearts.

418
00:23:09,305 --> 00:23:11,307
And that's why I'm
running for mayor.

419
00:23:12,725 --> 00:23:14,310
Mayor of Eddington.

420
00:23:14,894 --> 00:23:16,104
Did he just say what
I think he said?

421
00:23:16,187 --> 00:23:20,275
I have, uh, served this county
as sheriff for seven years

422
00:23:20,358 --> 00:23:22,694
and it has been my honor,
and I would be honored

423
00:23:22,777 --> 00:23:24,195
to serve you as mayor.

424
00:23:28,282 --> 00:23:29,282
Hey!

425
00:23:33,704 --> 00:23:35,914
-Yeah, right.
-You're going to be okay.

426
00:23:38,376 --> 00:23:40,086
Okay, here comes another one.

427
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:42,714
Three cops for one guy.

428
00:23:42,797 --> 00:23:44,174
Here we go.

429
00:23:44,257 --> 00:23:46,634
Sheriff, this for real?

430
00:23:48,010 --> 00:23:50,722
Yes. All right, we got to make
up for lost time. Who's this?

431
00:23:50,805 --> 00:23:52,849
A day drinker. OWI.

432
00:23:54,350 --> 00:23:56,770
I'm not gonna tell you
any more because one:

433
00:23:56,853 --> 00:23:58,146
I don't have to,

434
00:23:58,229 --> 00:23:59,355
and two: you're gonna do
whatever shit you're gonna do.

435
00:23:59,438 --> 00:24:01,191
Wow. How much did
you drink, kid?

436
00:24:01,274 --> 00:24:02,817
Um, honestly, low-key,

437
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:04,235
not enough for you
to put me in here.

438
00:24:04,318 --> 00:24:06,196
He refused to take
the field test.

439
00:24:06,279 --> 00:24:08,740
Okay, campaign signs. Now
which one of you has Photoshop?

440
00:24:08,823 --> 00:24:11,201
Oh, uh, my uncle does,
but I think it expired.

441
00:24:11,284 --> 00:24:13,203
Okay, un-expire it. Get on
down to Kinko's in Las Cruces.

442
00:24:13,286 --> 00:24:14,412
"Joe Cross for Mayor." Okay?

443
00:24:14,495 --> 00:24:15,747
Guy, you can draw, right?

444
00:24:15,830 --> 00:24:17,040
Just stick figures.

445
00:24:17,123 --> 00:24:18,750
Okay, good. Look, here's
what I want. A man.

446
00:24:18,833 --> 00:24:19,751
I hope you're
locked and loaded...

447
00:24:19,834 --> 00:24:20,752
He's got a face mask...

448
00:24:20,835 --> 00:24:21,920
...because you got to get me.

449
00:24:22,003 --> 00:24:24,214
...but he's got x's for
eyes 'cause he's dead.

450
00:24:24,297 --> 00:24:25,840
Look, I know I made
a mistake, okay?

451
00:24:25,923 --> 00:24:27,342
I know what you guys
are trying to do.

452
00:24:27,425 --> 00:24:28,802
I know what kind
of cops you are.

453
00:24:28,885 --> 00:24:30,929
Look, I don't know
what else to say.

454
00:24:31,012 --> 00:24:32,972
Now I need your boys' support.

455
00:24:33,055 --> 00:24:34,432
Okay, this is what
we're doing now.

456
00:24:34,515 --> 00:24:36,810
You've been deputized. This
is our campaign office.

457
00:24:36,893 --> 00:24:39,187
So, yes, right? Yes!

458
00:24:40,938 --> 00:24:41,938
Hell yeah.

459
00:24:42,148 --> 00:24:43,148
Yes!

460
00:24:43,608 --> 00:24:46,151
-Yeah.
-Okay, good. Okay.

461
00:24:47,486 --> 00:24:49,072
Guy, look, do me a favor.

462
00:24:49,155 --> 00:24:50,073
Get one of your friends to buy

463
00:24:50,156 --> 00:24:51,407
one of Louise's
dolls again. Okay?

464
00:24:51,490 --> 00:24:52,408
Oh, yeah. Yes, sir.

465
00:24:52,491 --> 00:24:53,618
I'll pay 'em straight back.

466
00:24:53,701 --> 00:24:55,954
Can do. Does it
matter which one?

467
00:24:56,037 --> 00:24:57,954
Just one of the new
ones. Doesn't matter.

468
00:24:59,540 --> 00:25:01,500
Hey, hey, Sheriff,
check this out.

469
00:25:02,793 --> 00:25:04,921
What's that? Three
hundred yards?

470
00:25:05,004 --> 00:25:06,589
Three-fifty. No scope.

471
00:25:06,672 --> 00:25:07,590
Promise?

472
00:25:07,673 --> 00:25:10,093
Yeah. I still got the
AR out for practice.

473
00:25:10,176 --> 00:25:11,427
That's beautiful, Mikey.

474
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:13,720
But you ain't shit
'til you beat mine.

475
00:25:15,723 --> 00:25:16,891
Sheriff's Department.

476
00:25:16,974 --> 00:25:20,019
Hey, Sheriff, if you win,
what does that mean for here?

477
00:25:20,102 --> 00:25:22,480
Well, we get a bigger budget,
I'll tell you that much.

478
00:25:22,563 --> 00:25:23,563
Sheriff, it's for you.

479
00:25:23,814 --> 00:25:24,941
Okay.

480
00:25:25,858 --> 00:25:27,652
Hey, Guy, let's get going
on signatures. All right?

481
00:25:27,735 --> 00:25:29,278
Get ourselves on the ballot.

482
00:25:30,238 --> 00:25:31,239
Hello.

483
00:25:31,322 --> 00:25:32,949
Joe, I'm outside your office.

484
00:25:40,498 --> 00:25:43,626
I am recording
this. Fair warning.

485
00:25:43,709 --> 00:25:45,044
That really necessary?

486
00:25:45,586 --> 00:25:46,921
You are a public servant.

487
00:25:48,047 --> 00:25:49,090
So are you.

488
00:25:49,590 --> 00:25:50,466
Yep.

489
00:25:50,549 --> 00:25:51,926
And I think it's, uh,

490
00:25:52,009 --> 00:25:54,721
better if we just let it
all out on the table. Okay?

491
00:25:54,804 --> 00:25:58,140
I got nothing to hide,
you got nothing to hide.

492
00:26:01,936 --> 00:26:02,979
Okay.

493
00:26:03,062 --> 00:26:04,062
Well...

494
00:26:05,398 --> 00:26:06,398
First I'd...

495
00:26:08,234 --> 00:26:10,319
I just want to apologize
if I offended you

496
00:26:10,903 --> 00:26:12,071
for this morning or
for last night...

497
00:26:12,154 --> 00:26:14,490
No. No apology
needed. You didn't.

498
00:26:15,908 --> 00:26:16,908
Okay.

499
00:26:17,618 --> 00:26:18,786
Because if I did...

500
00:26:21,289 --> 00:26:23,040
then that would
help me understand.

501
00:26:24,333 --> 00:26:26,628
Well, your term
is up, and, uh...

502
00:26:26,711 --> 00:26:28,296
your town is dead.

503
00:26:28,379 --> 00:26:30,506
Now, how can I help
you understand?

504
00:26:35,636 --> 00:26:37,388
Look, Joe...

505
00:26:37,471 --> 00:26:38,514
Six feet.

506
00:26:43,352 --> 00:26:44,895
We never talked about it.

507
00:26:45,771 --> 00:26:47,523
The whole, you know...

508
00:26:48,774 --> 00:26:49,774
The whole...

509
00:26:50,943 --> 00:26:53,571
Can we just talk? Can we
just... Just the two of us?

510
00:26:53,654 --> 00:26:56,490
Yeah. We are, we are.

511
00:26:58,034 --> 00:26:59,034
Okay.

512
00:27:00,328 --> 00:27:01,871
So maybe I just
talk to your video.

513
00:27:01,954 --> 00:27:04,123
Ask where all your
deputies went?

514
00:27:04,206 --> 00:27:06,417
Okay, well, why don't you
just ask your governor

515
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:08,586
about her little Catch
and Release policy. Okay?

516
00:27:08,669 --> 00:27:09,671
Because if it wasn't for that,

517
00:27:09,754 --> 00:27:11,923
maybe I could hold
on to my deputies

518
00:27:12,006 --> 00:27:13,549
and the people we arrest.

519
00:27:13,632 --> 00:27:16,261
I know... I know one of them
was fired for excessive force

520
00:27:16,344 --> 00:27:17,720
and another one
was forced to quit

521
00:27:17,803 --> 00:27:19,681
by a YouTube first
amendment auditor.

522
00:27:19,764 --> 00:27:20,723
Yeah. Okay. Yes,

523
00:27:20,806 --> 00:27:22,058
that is the same auditor

524
00:27:22,141 --> 00:27:23,309
that drove away your
worthless police department.

525
00:27:23,392 --> 00:27:25,353
Your Under sheriff died
from a fentanyl overdose.

526
00:27:25,436 --> 00:27:26,688
From handling fentanyl. Okay?

527
00:27:26,771 --> 00:27:28,147
And your Captain and
your Chief Deputy...

528
00:27:28,230 --> 00:27:29,440
He confiscated it
without gloves.

529
00:27:29,523 --> 00:27:32,360
-...took jobs in Rio Rancho.
-That was devastating!

530
00:27:32,443 --> 00:27:34,028
You can't keep your
own office going,

531
00:27:34,111 --> 00:27:35,446
but you're gonna run mine?

532
00:27:35,529 --> 00:27:37,990
Leave your mess here and
start a whole new one.

533
00:27:42,119 --> 00:27:43,579
And I do think it's
because of the person

534
00:27:43,662 --> 00:27:46,374
that's name you might not
want me saying on camera.

535
00:27:46,457 --> 00:27:47,917
Oh, s-say her name.

536
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,711
Okay? Because I think you're
the one that doesn't want it.

537
00:27:49,794 --> 00:27:50,795
I do think it's because of that.

538
00:27:50,878 --> 00:27:52,005
Is that what you think?

539
00:27:52,088 --> 00:27:53,964
Well, I'll tell you
what I think, Ted. Okay?

540
00:27:54,673 --> 00:27:57,802
I used to think that
you were some big deal,

541
00:27:58,552 --> 00:28:02,140
but now I realize, and I can
tell you flat-out to your face

542
00:28:02,223 --> 00:28:05,643
that I am a much better
human being than you.

543
00:28:05,726 --> 00:28:07,603
And I'm gonna make a
better, and stronger,

544
00:28:07,686 --> 00:28:09,647
and more honest leader than you.

545
00:28:09,730 --> 00:28:12,358
So let's just let
the voters decide.

546
00:28:15,069 --> 00:28:17,446
You're making a mistake.

547
00:28:17,905 --> 00:28:19,782
Is that why you ran
here all panicked?

548
00:28:19,865 --> 00:28:21,576
I came to save you
from embarrassment.

549
00:28:21,659 --> 00:28:23,494
Oh, gee-whiz, I'm tearing up.

550
00:28:23,577 --> 00:28:25,830
Forfeiting 30 years
of property taxes,

551
00:28:25,913 --> 00:28:28,166
and you won't say because
of some NDA you signed,

552
00:28:28,249 --> 00:28:29,667
but you want a "yay"
from everyone here.

553
00:28:29,750 --> 00:28:31,836
He explained this
already, Paula.

554
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:33,129
-Yeah. Yeah.
-Explained what?

555
00:28:33,212 --> 00:28:35,506
Why doesn't he explain
about the water and energy

556
00:28:35,589 --> 00:28:36,632
these data centers consume

557
00:28:36,715 --> 00:28:38,593
when we're in a
historic drought?

558
00:28:38,676 --> 00:28:39,969
-We're always in a drought.
-Yes, exactly.

559
00:28:40,052 --> 00:28:41,637
And we're making
up for the energy

560
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:43,806
and water with the solar
that we're bringing in.

561
00:28:43,889 --> 00:28:46,559
Okay, so... so let's
talk about the solar.

562
00:28:46,642 --> 00:28:49,145
No. Uh, I'm sorry.
You know what?

563
00:28:49,228 --> 00:28:50,688
Can we call the question, Phil?
We've got to just call it.

564
00:28:50,771 --> 00:28:51,856
Excuse me?

565
00:28:51,939 --> 00:28:54,859
Okay. All right. Uh, item 50.

566
00:28:54,942 --> 00:28:58,780
Third reading of a
resolution approving...

567
00:28:58,863 --> 00:29:00,031
What?

568
00:29:00,114 --> 00:29:01,449
...a series of six
industrial revenue bonds

569
00:29:01,532 --> 00:29:05,787
for the construction of a, uh,
proposed hyperscale data campus

570
00:29:05,870 --> 00:29:07,205
in Eddington, New Mexico.

571
00:29:07,288 --> 00:29:09,832
Excuse me? A question
needs to be seconded,

572
00:29:09,915 --> 00:29:10,875
and I am the
agreed-upon Chairwoman.

573
00:29:10,958 --> 00:29:12,001
Point of order!

574
00:29:12,084 --> 00:29:13,564
Can we not fucking
shut this bitch up?

575
00:29:13,752 --> 00:29:15,004
Just chill.

576
00:29:15,087 --> 00:29:16,847
Question has been called.
I've got my second.

577
00:29:20,634 --> 00:29:21,634
Mask over nose.

578
00:29:22,595 --> 00:29:23,721
Like you're writing.

579
00:29:26,932 --> 00:29:28,184
Hey, you know,

580
00:29:28,267 --> 00:29:29,519
you might actually read
that while you're reading

581
00:29:29,602 --> 00:29:31,437
because you're
forgetting half of it.

582
00:29:34,565 --> 00:29:35,608
Ted, hey,

583
00:29:35,691 --> 00:29:37,235
this is what you
need to focus on,

584
00:29:37,318 --> 00:29:39,070
not your dumb-ass Sheriff.

585
00:29:39,153 --> 00:29:40,905
Just the shit with his
wife's mental health,

586
00:29:40,988 --> 00:29:42,031
-we shut him right down.
-I've said it already.

587
00:29:42,114 --> 00:29:43,698
I don't want to go
there. I meant that.

588
00:29:44,658 --> 00:29:45,618
-So you fucked her...
-No!

589
00:29:45,701 --> 00:29:47,245
-It's a small town.
-No!

590
00:29:47,328 --> 00:29:48,704
No, I did not.

591
00:29:49,288 --> 00:29:52,041
I went out with her a couple
of times 20 years ago.

592
00:29:52,124 --> 00:29:54,168
She was weird. She
wouldn't let me touch her.

593
00:29:54,251 --> 00:29:55,628
I didn't want to touch her.

594
00:29:55,961 --> 00:29:57,338
So I dropped it.

595
00:29:57,421 --> 00:29:58,756
And then out of nowhere,
her whackadoo ma

596
00:29:58,839 --> 00:30:00,591
came after me, like,
six months later

597
00:30:00,674 --> 00:30:03,052
when she got
apparently pregnant.

598
00:30:03,135 --> 00:30:06,305
That was six months after
I never touched her.

599
00:30:08,182 --> 00:30:09,600
You see how that sounds, though?

600
00:30:10,142 --> 00:30:12,770
And her mom, who is
crazy, is very online.

601
00:30:14,313 --> 00:30:16,106
Oh, before I forget...

602
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:19,902
The Governor says thank you.

603
00:30:25,199 --> 00:30:26,283
Well, that's nice.

604
00:30:27,076 --> 00:30:28,453
Would have been nicer in person.

605
00:30:28,536 --> 00:30:29,412
Yeah, well, you
get that through,

606
00:30:29,495 --> 00:30:30,705
you can tell her yourself.

607
00:30:30,788 --> 00:30:32,581
Be in her office when
she goes to Washington.

608
00:30:33,666 --> 00:30:34,666
Hey!

609
00:30:36,001 --> 00:30:37,586
Whose car do you think that is?

610
00:30:38,045 --> 00:30:40,506
-You said I could.
-I said what?

611
00:30:40,589 --> 00:30:43,008
You said I could borrow
the car to hang with Brian.

612
00:30:51,183 --> 00:30:52,602
What do you think you're doing?

613
00:30:52,685 --> 00:30:54,437
You said I could borrow the car.

614
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:55,771
What's this I'm hearing

615
00:30:55,854 --> 00:30:58,483
about a gathering last
week, and you were there?

616
00:30:58,566 --> 00:31:00,818
If you mean Saturday, that
was, like, five people.

617
00:31:00,901 --> 00:31:03,112
We were double-distanced
and we all wore masks.

618
00:31:06,949 --> 00:31:08,367
That's not six feet.

619
00:31:08,993 --> 00:31:09,993
Excuse me?

620
00:31:11,453 --> 00:31:13,093
Just who do you think
you're talking with?

621
00:31:15,666 --> 00:31:17,585
-Sorry.
-We are in lockdown.

622
00:31:17,668 --> 00:31:19,545
I'm the one forcing lockdown.

623
00:31:20,254 --> 00:31:21,464
Anyone sees you out at a
gathering late at night.

624
00:31:21,547 --> 00:31:22,965
It's not late and
it's only five people.

625
00:31:23,048 --> 00:31:24,675
My son undermining my policies.

626
00:31:24,758 --> 00:31:27,053
You catch this, and
you could die. Okay?

627
00:31:27,136 --> 00:31:28,387
-Do you know how death works?
-Yeah. I'm just trying

628
00:31:28,470 --> 00:31:29,847
-to see my friend...
-No more Brian.

629
00:31:29,930 --> 00:31:31,724
So I don't have to kill myself.

630
00:31:33,851 --> 00:31:35,770
Just go. Out of my face.

631
00:31:35,853 --> 00:31:37,980
Only Brian. Only!

632
00:31:40,441 --> 00:31:42,067
It's Mom's birthday, by the way.

633
00:31:43,068 --> 00:31:44,278
Good for her.

634
00:31:44,361 --> 00:31:45,488
What am I supposed to
do with that, Eric?

635
00:31:45,571 --> 00:31:47,156
You want to send her a
letter? I'm just saying.

636
00:31:47,239 --> 00:31:48,616
-She ain't dropped us any pins.
-Okay. Whatever.

637
00:31:48,699 --> 00:31:50,034
-Who cares?
-And wash your hands.

638
00:31:50,117 --> 00:31:52,869
Covid stays alive on
paper for five weeks.

639
00:31:54,663 --> 00:31:56,707
When my son and me
woke up one morning

640
00:31:56,790 --> 00:32:00,545
to find that my wife, his
mother, had abandoned us

641
00:32:00,628 --> 00:32:03,172
without a note, without a word,

642
00:32:03,255 --> 00:32:05,090
we were devastated.

643
00:32:05,549 --> 00:32:07,552
All hope seemed lost.

644
00:32:07,635 --> 00:32:11,013
But we had our
community to lift us up.

645
00:32:11,096 --> 00:32:12,514
We had Eddington.

646
00:32:14,224 --> 00:32:15,685
And when I first ran for Mayor,

647
00:32:15,768 --> 00:32:17,395
it's 'cause I wanted to
give back to the town

648
00:32:17,478 --> 00:32:19,271
that has given me so much.

649
00:32:20,356 --> 00:32:22,191
Since then, we've
helped the Governor

650
00:32:22,274 --> 00:32:23,484
in her mission to start building

651
00:32:23,567 --> 00:32:26,904
a 100% clean energy economy.

652
00:32:26,987 --> 00:32:30,032
We're working to provide
homes to new technologies

653
00:32:30,115 --> 00:32:33,911
and create new,
reliable, secure jobs.

654
00:32:34,411 --> 00:32:36,622
And as we walk
towards the next term,

655
00:32:36,997 --> 00:32:39,584
I'm ready to continue
leading our town

656
00:32:39,667 --> 00:32:41,252
and fighting the pandemic

657
00:32:41,335 --> 00:32:43,546
and the racial and
economic inequities

658
00:32:43,629 --> 00:32:45,339
that Covid-19 only made worse.

659
00:32:45,422 --> 00:32:49,218
Racial inequities? What the
fuck is he doing to fight that?

660
00:32:49,301 --> 00:32:51,220
Well, he's Hispanic.

661
00:32:54,932 --> 00:32:56,017
Okay, but who are...

662
00:32:56,100 --> 00:32:57,101
Where is he getting
these Black ladies from?

663
00:32:57,184 --> 00:32:58,894
What, is he shipping
in people now?

664
00:33:00,813 --> 00:33:02,732
What is this? The Jeffersons?

665
00:33:02,815 --> 00:33:05,276
Re-elect Ted Garcia for mayor.

666
00:33:05,359 --> 00:33:08,446
We can't go back. We
can only go better.

667
00:33:08,529 --> 00:33:09,780
Race you to come up
with a better slogan.

668
00:33:09,863 --> 00:33:10,948
And you too.

669
00:33:11,031 --> 00:33:12,631
I already put eight
of them on the board.

670
00:33:14,326 --> 00:33:16,787
-Oh.
-Uh, well...

671
00:33:16,870 --> 00:33:18,456
How about... Wait, so...

672
00:33:18,539 --> 00:33:21,125
theirs goes, "We can't go
back, we can only go better."

673
00:33:21,208 --> 00:33:23,753
So we go, "Yeah,
we can't go back,

674
00:33:23,836 --> 00:33:26,464
but we can, like, you know.

675
00:33:26,547 --> 00:33:28,799
We can learn by our mistakes."

676
00:33:28,882 --> 00:33:29,592
Yeah.

677
00:33:29,675 --> 00:33:30,926
And Bitcoin.

678
00:33:31,009 --> 00:33:33,137
Use it to get county residents
on the block chain, too.

679
00:33:33,220 --> 00:33:34,138
You know, get 'em motivated.

680
00:33:34,221 --> 00:33:35,806
-Hey, before I forget.
-Hey, Sheriff.

681
00:33:35,889 --> 00:33:37,224
-I got in with the city clerk...
-Back up.

682
00:33:37,307 --> 00:33:39,352
...and we need a
chairperson and a treasurer.

683
00:33:39,435 --> 00:33:40,353
Hey, Sheriff, look at this.

684
00:33:40,436 --> 00:33:41,979
I got 43 names on
the petition...

685
00:33:42,062 --> 00:33:43,731
-Hey, finish this up for me.
-...but we're gonna need 150.

686
00:33:43,814 --> 00:33:44,940
I ran through the
council meetings

687
00:33:45,023 --> 00:33:46,442
that are all on YouTube.

688
00:33:47,067 --> 00:33:48,527
You're gonna want to see this.

689
00:33:49,278 --> 00:33:50,780
The man that's forcing
this item through

690
00:33:50,863 --> 00:33:52,156
is a man that turned off

691
00:33:52,239 --> 00:33:53,491
his people's lights

692
00:33:53,574 --> 00:33:55,242
in the middle of a
global health pandemic.

693
00:33:55,325 --> 00:33:57,536
What about their businesses
that you shuttered?

694
00:33:57,619 --> 00:33:59,622
You already got the state
to make that nice road

695
00:33:59,705 --> 00:34:01,499
that you say is for tourism,

696
00:34:01,582 --> 00:34:03,626
but all I see is it leads
straight to the site

697
00:34:03,709 --> 00:34:05,002
of this hypothetical
data campus.

698
00:34:05,085 --> 00:34:06,671
Pardon me. Is Paula in?

699
00:34:06,754 --> 00:34:08,506
So what is Solidgoldmagikarp?

700
00:34:08,589 --> 00:34:10,633
Is it like, what,
Microsoft or...

701
00:34:10,716 --> 00:34:12,593
Oh, not even. It's
some random AI

702
00:34:12,676 --> 00:34:15,554
or Deep Learning or some crap.

703
00:34:15,637 --> 00:34:18,182
Warren's the one that got Ted
to run in the first place.

704
00:34:18,265 --> 00:34:20,183
Land commissioner is his, too.

705
00:34:26,732 --> 00:34:27,732
Okay, I'm gonna go.

706
00:34:28,525 --> 00:34:29,568
What would I say?

707
00:34:30,110 --> 00:34:32,738
I-I wouldn't say anything
'cause she's annoying as fuck.

708
00:34:33,655 --> 00:34:35,825
She's worse than my dad with
her social justice shit.

709
00:34:35,908 --> 00:34:37,660
-Where are you going?
-Getting another beer.

710
00:34:37,743 --> 00:34:39,411
Dude, you have to drive us back.

711
00:34:57,721 --> 00:34:58,801
Oh, shit, I love that book.

712
00:34:59,598 --> 00:35:00,766
Sorry, what?

713
00:35:00,849 --> 00:35:01,849
I love that book.

714
00:35:02,976 --> 00:35:04,395
You know she was awarded

715
00:35:04,478 --> 00:35:07,439
the Lenin Peace Prize
by the Soviet Union?

716
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:09,525
Oh, really?

717
00:35:11,068 --> 00:35:12,110
I'm Brian.

718
00:35:12,736 --> 00:35:13,571
Hi.

719
00:35:13,654 --> 00:35:14,739
I know you're Sarah.

720
00:35:14,822 --> 00:35:16,365
You were, like, a year
above me, I think.

721
00:35:16,448 --> 00:35:17,448
Okay.

722
00:35:19,159 --> 00:35:22,746
It's weird to be
gathering, right? Like...

723
00:35:24,164 --> 00:35:26,208
Feels like this will be
in the news in a few days.

724
00:35:26,291 --> 00:35:27,417
Superspreader.

725
00:35:29,878 --> 00:35:30,878
Sorry.

726
00:35:33,257 --> 00:35:34,925
You guys want a beer?

727
00:35:35,008 --> 00:35:36,008
-Sure.
-Sure.

728
00:35:48,730 --> 00:35:51,609
No. No, you're fine. She's
just doing her own thing.

729
00:35:51,692 --> 00:35:53,903
Oh. Okay. Cool.

730
00:35:53,986 --> 00:35:57,363
So, wait, what did he say
when he came up to you?

731
00:35:58,615 --> 00:35:59,450
He said something
about my book...

732
00:35:59,533 --> 00:36:00,533
Who's your friend?

733
00:36:03,662 --> 00:36:04,662
I don't know.

734
00:36:06,331 --> 00:36:08,917
She's just trying to make her
old-ass boyfriend jealous.

735
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:12,087
She has a boyfriend?
Where is he?

736
00:36:12,170 --> 00:36:13,505
Not here.

737
00:36:16,008 --> 00:36:17,259
Oh, there he is.

738
00:36:17,342 --> 00:36:19,094
They're not dating anymore.

739
00:36:19,177 --> 00:36:21,096
She dumped him
because he's a cop.

740
00:36:21,179 --> 00:36:23,390
Or then he broke up
with her. Whatever.

741
00:36:23,473 --> 00:36:25,059
So many privileged white kids

742
00:36:25,142 --> 00:36:27,853
suddenly crying about
"anti-racism", it's just like...

743
00:36:27,936 --> 00:36:29,688
Yeah, no. I get it. It's true.

744
00:36:29,771 --> 00:36:32,316
I mean, really, it's just
another display of privilege.

745
00:36:32,399 --> 00:36:34,193
Yeah, but like,

746
00:36:34,276 --> 00:36:38,196
at the same time, not all white
kids are all that privileged.

747
00:36:40,032 --> 00:36:41,116
Uh...

748
00:36:41,199 --> 00:36:43,118
Like, there's different
sorts of privilege.

749
00:36:43,201 --> 00:36:45,454
You know, like race and class.

750
00:36:45,537 --> 00:36:47,122
Did you drop your red
cap back there, Bri?

751
00:36:47,205 --> 00:36:48,873
Shut up. You know what I mean.

752
00:36:58,133 --> 00:36:59,384
You know, I'm promoting you.

753
00:37:02,596 --> 00:37:03,889
Really?

754
00:37:04,222 --> 00:37:05,222
I mean, I...

755
00:37:06,266 --> 00:37:07,266
Don't you think?

756
00:37:08,352 --> 00:37:09,895
Yeah. Of course.

757
00:37:11,104 --> 00:37:12,731
So, what? Uh...

758
00:37:13,231 --> 00:37:14,231
Sergeant?

759
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:16,277
You like that?

760
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:18,987
Y-Yeah. Thank you, Sheriff.

761
00:37:21,239 --> 00:37:22,491
You know, I'm actually
older than my dad

762
00:37:22,574 --> 00:37:23,575
when he was Sergeant.

763
00:37:24,618 --> 00:37:27,537
Well, your dad was Captain

764
00:37:28,163 --> 00:37:29,373
when I was deputy.

765
00:37:29,873 --> 00:37:33,001
So, you know, we all
got to take these steps.

766
00:37:34,044 --> 00:37:35,629
He only ever made it to Captain.

767
00:37:39,424 --> 00:37:41,927
You know, hopefully one
day I'll earn Captain, too.

768
00:37:46,515 --> 00:37:51,770
And, uh, Sheriff, this...
this ain't 'cause of the news?

769
00:37:52,729 --> 00:37:53,981
What news?

770
00:37:55,857 --> 00:37:57,651
Yeah, cool. Great.

771
00:38:27,806 --> 00:38:29,183
Hello? Lou?

772
00:38:29,266 --> 00:38:31,143
...ruin a man's day,

773
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:33,020
-or you can do...
-Hello?

774
00:38:34,146 --> 00:38:35,146
Lou?

775
00:38:46,742 --> 00:38:48,869
And that's why I'm
running for Mayor.

776
00:38:50,328 --> 00:38:51,621
Mayor of Eddington.

777
00:38:53,749 --> 00:38:56,710
I have, uh, served
this county as sheriff

778
00:38:56,793 --> 00:38:58,921
for seven years, and
it has been my honor,

779
00:38:59,004 --> 00:39:02,967
and I would be honored to
serve you as Mayor. Okay?

780
00:39:03,050 --> 00:39:05,761
And I will continue
to fight for you, uh,

781
00:39:05,844 --> 00:39:07,721
even if it's against
the government,

782
00:39:07,804 --> 00:39:09,515
okay, if that's what that means!

783
00:39:09,598 --> 00:39:12,601
Uh, because w-we need to
stop these lies. Okay?

784
00:39:12,684 --> 00:39:14,311
We need to reopen
our businesses. Okay?

785
00:39:14,394 --> 00:39:15,938
Covid may be a problem,

786
00:39:16,021 --> 00:39:18,482
but it certainly
ain't our problem.

787
00:39:19,066 --> 00:39:20,942
Thank you super-duper very much.

788
00:39:22,110 --> 00:39:24,488
Ladies and gentlemen,
what have you, this is...

789
00:39:44,049 --> 00:39:47,719
The image is true,
language is evil.

790
00:39:48,261 --> 00:39:51,807
Now, your physical body
might have been assaulted,

791
00:39:51,890 --> 00:39:55,227
as mine was. But we
are evolving right now.

792
00:39:55,310 --> 00:39:58,480
And this now is not natural.
We are being invaded.

793
00:39:58,563 --> 00:40:00,315
Human thought is
being phased out.

794
00:40:00,398 --> 00:40:02,693
It is against God,
what is happening.

795
00:40:02,776 --> 00:40:04,276
There is a new God arriving.

796
00:40:07,739 --> 00:40:08,907
Hey. Hey.

797
00:40:09,699 --> 00:40:10,784
Where were you?

798
00:40:10,867 --> 00:40:11,869
You don't tell her
what you're doing.

799
00:40:11,952 --> 00:40:12,995
Lou.

800
00:40:13,078 --> 00:40:14,830
Why should she tell you?

801
00:40:14,913 --> 00:40:16,707
Hey. Where were you?

802
00:40:16,790 --> 00:40:18,125
I took her to a talk by someone

803
00:40:18,208 --> 00:40:19,043
she actually wanted
to listen to.

804
00:40:19,126 --> 00:40:22,463
Baby, let's... Ooh.

805
00:40:22,546 --> 00:40:23,922
This is how you defend her?

806
00:40:24,005 --> 00:40:25,007
By abandoning your office?

807
00:40:25,090 --> 00:40:27,051
Lou, come on, open
up. Let's talk.

808
00:40:27,134 --> 00:40:28,468
Has she not gone through enough?

809
00:40:40,772 --> 00:40:42,274
I was worried about you.

810
00:40:44,484 --> 00:40:45,569
Where were you?

811
00:40:51,032 --> 00:40:53,785
I'm doing this for us, Rabbit.

812
00:40:58,790 --> 00:40:59,790
Okay...

813
00:41:00,584 --> 00:41:02,252
I should have told you first.

814
00:41:02,335 --> 00:41:04,922
I just... I got so excited,

815
00:41:05,005 --> 00:41:07,549
and I didn't want to overthink
it, so I just did it.

816
00:41:08,133 --> 00:41:10,928
But I should have told you.
I'm-I'm sorry. I just...

817
00:41:11,011 --> 00:41:14,222
This whole town is
just lying down,

818
00:41:15,056 --> 00:41:17,392
and if we see what's happening,

819
00:41:17,809 --> 00:41:20,062
and we see that it's wrong,

820
00:41:20,145 --> 00:41:22,939
and we can't see this
as an opportunity to...

821
00:41:24,274 --> 00:41:25,901
to do the right thing.

822
00:41:27,444 --> 00:41:29,738
We can... We can
bring this place back.

823
00:41:29,821 --> 00:41:31,531
We can build it back up.

824
00:41:35,493 --> 00:41:37,662
Lou?

825
00:41:37,996 --> 00:41:39,540
Did you know

826
00:41:39,623 --> 00:41:42,042
that this used to be
a copper mining town?

827
00:41:42,125 --> 00:41:43,960
You need to be quiet.

828
00:41:45,754 --> 00:41:46,922
I'm sorry.

829
00:41:47,005 --> 00:41:49,841
I don't know how you don't
remember what they said.

830
00:41:50,967 --> 00:41:53,470
About her not having stress,

831
00:41:53,553 --> 00:41:55,597
about how she can't have stress,

832
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:56,974
but I can't.

833
00:41:57,057 --> 00:41:59,768
So... I'm not being dramatic.

834
00:42:00,644 --> 00:42:02,562
I cannot slip again.

835
00:42:03,146 --> 00:42:06,149
Y-You won't slip.
I'm gonna catch you.

836
00:42:08,193 --> 00:42:10,404
People are gonna be
looking here now.

837
00:42:10,487 --> 00:42:12,614
-No, no one's looking.
-And sticking their noses in.

838
00:42:12,697 --> 00:42:14,699
-No.
-And shaming her.

839
00:42:16,159 --> 00:42:18,162
Try to say "me,"
baby. Not "her."

840
00:42:18,245 --> 00:42:19,788
You really just
don't give a damn

841
00:42:19,871 --> 00:42:21,790
what happens to his department?

842
00:42:21,873 --> 00:42:24,793
I mean, you hardly did
before. But, I mean...

843
00:42:24,876 --> 00:42:27,004
I don't want this thing
with Ted. You understand?

844
00:42:27,087 --> 00:42:28,088
Okay.

845
00:42:29,047 --> 00:42:31,800
This is your thing, and
it's Mama's, it's not mine.

846
00:42:31,883 --> 00:42:34,511
Okay, but I'm-I'm
defending you, Rabbit.

847
00:42:34,594 --> 00:42:36,388
Let the child ventilate.

848
00:42:36,471 --> 00:42:37,889
Let's have dinner tonight. Okay?

849
00:42:38,265 --> 00:42:40,142
Baby, I'm your husband,

850
00:42:40,225 --> 00:42:41,977
and I will not do anything
you don't want me to do.

851
00:42:42,060 --> 00:42:43,729
Your real husband wouldn't
have to say "I'm your husband."

852
00:42:43,812 --> 00:42:44,855
Dawn, please! Okay?

853
00:42:44,938 --> 00:42:46,148
He'll listen to you,
he'll understand you.

854
00:42:46,231 --> 00:42:48,233
He won't have to wave
your vows in your face.

855
00:42:48,316 --> 00:42:50,068
Let's just get
together. You and me.

856
00:42:50,151 --> 00:42:52,613
We will make a decision
together as a team.

857
00:42:52,696 --> 00:42:55,157
If you want me to
retract it, I will.

858
00:42:55,240 --> 00:42:57,534
Absolutely, no problem.

859
00:42:57,617 --> 00:43:00,037
Just, yes, you, me,
dinner, tonight. Can we?

860
00:43:00,120 --> 00:43:02,456
-Fine! Fine!
-Please? Yes?

861
00:43:02,539 --> 00:43:05,667
-Just go!
-Yes. Okay. Okay. I'm going.

862
00:43:05,750 --> 00:43:08,753
Dinner tonight. Dinner
tonight. Thank you. Thank you.

863
00:43:11,756 --> 00:43:12,756
Hi!

864
00:43:20,807 --> 00:43:23,352
If you ever look at the
Mayor's Advisory Board...

865
00:43:23,435 --> 00:43:25,187
Well, that board
is actually one man

866
00:43:25,270 --> 00:43:27,356
and that man is Warren Sandoval.

867
00:43:27,439 --> 00:43:31,735
Eddington's quote... "City
Economic Development Official."

868
00:43:31,818 --> 00:43:33,654
And when Mayor Garcia talks,

869
00:43:33,737 --> 00:43:36,031
it's Sandoval's
voice you're hearing.

870
00:43:36,114 --> 00:43:38,367
But who's Sandoval speaking for?

871
00:43:38,450 --> 00:43:39,868
It ain't you!

872
00:43:39,951 --> 00:43:43,872
Maybe it's for your Governor,
who he's been on vacation with.

873
00:43:43,955 --> 00:43:46,583
Maybe it's for the
people that got the mayor

874
00:43:46,666 --> 00:43:49,086
to get that expensive
new road built

875
00:43:49,169 --> 00:43:51,880
out there in the
desert, with your money!

876
00:43:51,963 --> 00:43:53,757
Did you ask for that?

877
00:43:53,840 --> 00:43:54,883
And did you know

878
00:43:54,966 --> 00:43:57,928
that it leads out to a
top-secret development

879
00:43:58,011 --> 00:43:59,846
just within the city limits?

880
00:43:59,929 --> 00:44:01,139
Well, you should!

881
00:44:01,222 --> 00:44:05,269
They've annexed 800 acres,
it has been re-zoned,

882
00:44:05,352 --> 00:44:07,437
the development and
utility agreements

883
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:09,439
are getting into place.

884
00:44:09,522 --> 00:44:12,734
Replacing your businesses
with their server farms.

885
00:44:12,817 --> 00:44:16,071
Solidgoldmagikarp. Look it up.

886
00:44:16,154 --> 00:44:18,073
This is Deep Learning.

887
00:44:18,156 --> 00:44:21,451
That is deepfake
from the deep state.

888
00:44:21,534 --> 00:44:22,744
And to whose benefit?

889
00:44:22,827 --> 00:44:25,289
The same people
that always benefit.

890
00:44:25,372 --> 00:44:26,665
It's not you.

891
00:44:26,748 --> 00:44:27,582
Bro. Bro, who are
you talking to?

892
00:44:27,665 --> 00:44:29,125
There's nobody here.

893
00:44:30,418 --> 00:44:32,713
And here we've got an
Eddington youngster

894
00:44:32,796 --> 00:44:33,964
who has yet to
join the workforce.

895
00:44:34,047 --> 00:44:35,632
You should tell
them about the time

896
00:44:35,715 --> 00:44:37,258
my dad dumped your wife.

897
00:44:41,513 --> 00:44:42,889
The fuck?

898
00:44:45,350 --> 00:44:46,601
Fucking faggot.

899
00:44:46,684 --> 00:44:47,811
Shit.

900
00:44:47,894 --> 00:44:49,813
Hey, do I cut or...

901
00:44:49,896 --> 00:44:52,649
Yes! Yes! And delete
that last part.

902
00:44:52,732 --> 00:44:53,400
Of course.

903
00:44:53,483 --> 00:44:54,651
The part with him talking.

904
00:44:54,734 --> 00:44:55,860
Yep. Yep.

905
00:44:58,446 --> 00:44:59,448
Fuck you, too.

906
00:44:59,531 --> 00:45:00,740
-Sheriff! Sheriff!
-What?

907
00:45:02,325 --> 00:45:03,993
Hey, hands up, don't shoot!

908
00:45:05,954 --> 00:45:06,954
Hello.

909
00:45:07,747 --> 00:45:08,915
What are we doing here?

910
00:45:08,998 --> 00:45:10,792
-What is this?
-We have a right to assembly.

911
00:45:10,875 --> 00:45:12,502
Assembly? For... For
what? What are we...

912
00:45:12,585 --> 00:45:16,590
No justice! No peace!
No racist police!

913
00:45:16,673 --> 00:45:19,343
Racist police? Who?

914
00:45:19,426 --> 00:45:21,720
A third of my
department is fucking...

915
00:45:21,803 --> 00:45:23,013
Come on, guys.

916
00:45:23,096 --> 00:45:24,139
Get out the street. You're
blocking through traffic.

917
00:45:24,222 --> 00:45:25,265
We don't need police permission

918
00:45:25,348 --> 00:45:26,891
to protest police
violence, Michael.

919
00:45:27,642 --> 00:45:28,977
Police violence?

920
00:45:29,060 --> 00:45:30,770
But what violence are
you talking about?

921
00:45:31,146 --> 00:45:34,566
Now, kids, listen here.
This is not legal.

922
00:45:34,649 --> 00:45:36,151
-So if you could please stand...
-Slavery was legal!

923
00:45:36,234 --> 00:45:38,278
During slavery it was
illegal to free a slave.

924
00:45:38,361 --> 00:45:39,654
What about the Navajo Long Walk?

925
00:45:39,737 --> 00:45:40,864
What we did to them
and the Apache?

926
00:45:40,947 --> 00:45:41,865
That's all the
same government...

927
00:45:41,948 --> 00:45:43,367
Okay, you can always
tell when somebody's

928
00:45:43,450 --> 00:45:45,285
learned something new
in Social Studies.

929
00:45:45,368 --> 00:45:46,787
A man was just brutally...

930
00:45:46,870 --> 00:45:48,705
-Just get on the sidewalk.
-...brutally murdered by a cop.

931
00:45:48,788 --> 00:45:50,040
That didn't happen here.

932
00:45:50,123 --> 00:45:51,541
It happened! Is that not enough?

933
00:45:51,624 --> 00:45:52,584
Fucking traitor!

934
00:45:52,667 --> 00:45:53,502
This happens all the time!

935
00:45:53,585 --> 00:45:54,628
Brian, Daniel, Michelle,

936
00:45:54,711 --> 00:45:56,004
whoever you are, do
your parents know...

937
00:45:56,087 --> 00:45:57,214
Just take this to the sidewalk.

938
00:45:57,297 --> 00:45:58,965
...you're here
making some trouble?

939
00:45:59,549 --> 00:46:01,718
Okay, I didn't make Covid. Okay?

940
00:46:01,801 --> 00:46:03,595
I'm not the reason you're
all being locked in.

941
00:46:03,678 --> 00:46:04,918
Call whoever the fuck you want.

942
00:46:05,305 --> 00:46:07,599
-What?
-Call whoever the fuck you want.

943
00:46:09,601 --> 00:46:11,769
Okay. Uh, listen.

944
00:46:12,103 --> 00:46:13,855
I'm leaving now
for five minutes.

945
00:46:13,938 --> 00:46:15,982
When I come back,
I expect you gone.

946
00:46:16,065 --> 00:46:18,693
Five minutos. Disperse!

947
00:46:18,776 --> 00:46:22,363
Michael, you should
be with us. Come on.

948
00:46:24,157 --> 00:46:25,575
Black Lives Matter!

949
00:46:26,034 --> 00:46:32,539
Black Lives Matter!
Black Lives Matter!

950
00:46:45,512 --> 00:46:47,931
The man identified
as George Floyd

951
00:46:48,014 --> 00:46:49,683
by the lawyer
representing his family

952
00:46:49,766 --> 00:46:51,935
was later pronounced
dead at the hospital.

953
00:46:52,018 --> 00:46:55,230
Today the mayor called
it wrong at every level.

954
00:46:55,313 --> 00:46:59,234
What we saw was horrible
and utterly messed up.

955
00:46:59,317 --> 00:47:02,237
Okay, what was he being
detained for in the first place?

956
00:47:02,779 --> 00:47:03,905
I don't know, but I heard

957
00:47:03,988 --> 00:47:05,240
something about
excited delirium.

958
00:47:05,323 --> 00:47:06,241
Yeah, exactly.

959
00:47:06,324 --> 00:47:07,742
Yeah, and what's
going to happen when

960
00:47:07,825 --> 00:47:09,244
they release the footage
of him resisting?

961
00:47:09,327 --> 00:47:10,620
Are they going to
get their jobs back?

962
00:47:10,703 --> 00:47:12,163
So you saw this yesterday?

963
00:47:14,749 --> 00:47:16,459
Mike, you saw it yesterday?

964
00:47:17,085 --> 00:47:18,920
-Uh, yeah.
-You didn't say anything?

965
00:47:19,629 --> 00:47:20,797
You okay?

966
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:23,592
-I mean, it...
-Well...

967
00:47:23,675 --> 00:47:24,883
It was everywhere.

968
00:47:27,637 --> 00:47:29,055
Jesus Christ.

969
00:47:29,806 --> 00:47:31,766
There's already
riots in Minneapolis.

970
00:47:32,392 --> 00:47:33,602
Breaking into stores,
stealing shit.

971
00:47:33,685 --> 00:47:35,061
I mean, what's it going to prove

972
00:47:35,144 --> 00:47:37,064
if you set your own fucking
neighborhood on fire?

973
00:47:46,322 --> 00:47:47,323
What the...

974
00:47:47,907 --> 00:47:49,284
"Pig roast"?

975
00:47:49,367 --> 00:47:51,786
What the fuck are these
fuckers doing, man?

976
00:47:52,245 --> 00:47:53,580
Oh, Jesus Christ.

977
00:47:54,872 --> 00:47:56,791
Now they're driving
into churches?

978
00:47:56,874 --> 00:48:00,253
Sheriff, look at this. These
cops are just letting it happen.

979
00:48:00,962 --> 00:48:02,631
We got to be ready.
They're coming here next.

980
00:48:02,714 --> 00:48:03,924
-You know they are.
-Okay.

981
00:48:04,007 --> 00:48:06,134
-Bunch of fucking hoodlums...
-All right! Look.

982
00:48:08,219 --> 00:48:10,347
That's not a here problem. Okay?

983
00:48:10,430 --> 00:48:13,892
It's... It's bad. It's an
awful tragedy, okay? It's bad.

984
00:48:13,975 --> 00:48:16,978
But i-i-it's a bad apple that's
across the country, okay?

985
00:48:17,061 --> 00:48:19,773
Now let's just let our
kids blow off some steam.

986
00:48:19,856 --> 00:48:21,107
Michael, are you okay?

987
00:48:22,442 --> 00:48:23,442
Yeah.

988
00:48:35,038 --> 00:48:36,372
I got no cash, bro.

989
00:48:38,124 --> 00:48:39,542
I will make you cash!

990
00:48:42,545 --> 00:48:43,880
My tooth's infected.

991
00:48:43,963 --> 00:48:45,798
How many people did you invite?

992
00:48:46,215 --> 00:48:48,009
There should be more coming.

993
00:48:48,092 --> 00:48:49,636
Yeah. No, just because there's

994
00:48:49,719 --> 00:48:51,513
a protest at the Round
House in Santa Fe,

995
00:48:51,596 --> 00:48:54,057
and that's where we
should actually be.

996
00:48:54,140 --> 00:48:55,350
Like we've got to be careful.

997
00:48:55,433 --> 00:48:57,352
We can't just feel
happy with ourselves.

998
00:48:57,727 --> 00:49:00,396
Yeah. I mean, I obviously
agree with that.

999
00:49:01,022 --> 00:49:03,441
Yeah, and sorry, but you called
yourself anti-racist earlier,

1000
00:49:03,524 --> 00:49:06,069
and we can't just take that.

1001
00:49:06,152 --> 00:49:07,654
Like, do you know what
that would actually

1002
00:49:07,737 --> 00:49:09,281
take and mean?

1003
00:49:09,364 --> 00:49:11,658
Because I'm not an anti-racist
either, but right now

1004
00:49:11,741 --> 00:49:14,661
we're playing at maybe
being, like, White Critical.

1005
00:49:14,744 --> 00:49:16,079
Maybe we're White Traitors,

1006
00:49:16,162 --> 00:49:19,583
but the goal is to be
White Abolitionists.

1007
00:49:19,666 --> 00:49:21,084
And that means actually...

1008
00:49:21,167 --> 00:49:24,045
...changing institutions,
dismantling whiteness

1009
00:49:24,128 --> 00:49:26,881
and not allowing whiteness
to reassert itself.

1010
00:49:26,964 --> 00:49:30,385
But we're pretty much
light-years away from that.

1011
00:49:34,972 --> 00:49:36,933
Are you fucking retarded?

1012
00:49:37,684 --> 00:49:39,769
What the fuck are
you talking about?

1013
00:49:39,852 --> 00:49:41,312
You're white.

1014
00:49:41,688 --> 00:49:43,565
And that really gets
it nice and creamy.

1015
00:49:43,648 --> 00:49:46,901
Let's put in some olives,
so that we build the flavor.

1016
00:49:46,984 --> 00:49:49,237
Oh, yeah. All of
it. That's great.

1017
00:49:49,320 --> 00:49:52,115
Capers. You like
capers? I like capers.

1018
00:49:53,449 --> 00:49:55,076
Remember to film
Mikey's promotion

1019
00:49:55,159 --> 00:49:57,537
and to put it on
TikTok or whatever...

1020
00:49:58,371 --> 00:49:59,371
Whoa.

1021
00:50:05,002 --> 00:50:05,920
Before you vote,

1022
00:50:06,003 --> 00:50:07,631
remember Schott Solar...

1023
00:50:07,714 --> 00:50:10,759
60 million dollars in
grants in the garbage.

1024
00:50:10,842 --> 00:50:12,469
Those were the same
kind of high-interest

1025
00:50:12,552 --> 00:50:14,596
bonds he's bragging about here.

1026
00:50:14,679 --> 00:50:16,399
All right, council
member Garcia moves to...

1027
00:50:27,984 --> 00:50:29,611
It's multi-generational.

1028
00:50:29,694 --> 00:50:30,779
You commit suicide,

1029
00:50:30,862 --> 00:50:32,739
you can't be buried in
the Mossad cemetery,

1030
00:50:32,822 --> 00:50:34,324
so why's he there

1031
00:50:34,407 --> 00:50:37,200
if not as a message to say "It
wasn't suicide, we killed him"?

1032
00:50:42,039 --> 00:50:43,039
Joe?

1033
00:50:44,333 --> 00:50:46,002
This is the son-in-law.

1034
00:50:47,462 --> 00:50:49,505
-Joe?
-Yeah. Hey.

1035
00:50:50,047 --> 00:50:51,007
I am so sorry.

1036
00:50:51,090 --> 00:50:53,093
-Oh, yeah. Here we go.
-I texted you,

1037
00:50:53,176 --> 00:50:54,594
but it never went
through, I guess.

1038
00:50:54,677 --> 00:50:57,180
And a bouquet. Sheep's clothing.

1039
00:50:58,222 --> 00:50:59,933
-So sorry.
-Hi, there.

1040
00:51:00,016 --> 00:51:02,310
Son-in-law? Husband?

1041
00:51:02,393 --> 00:51:04,312
Sheriff? Mayor?

1042
00:51:04,979 --> 00:51:06,398
Well, mayor-to-be.

1043
00:51:06,481 --> 00:51:09,818
Well, we'll see.
Yeah. Joe Cross.

1044
00:51:09,901 --> 00:51:11,653
Sorry. I'm... Hello, I'm Vernon.

1045
00:51:11,736 --> 00:51:13,279
-Vernon.
-Yeah.

1046
00:51:14,280 --> 00:51:15,280
Oh.

1047
00:51:16,115 --> 00:51:17,575
J-Jefferson Peak?

1048
00:51:18,075 --> 00:51:19,075
Yes.

1049
00:51:24,081 --> 00:51:25,082
How you doing?

1050
00:51:25,750 --> 00:51:27,168
I'm Joe. This is my home.

1051
00:51:27,251 --> 00:51:28,503
-This...
-Uh-huh.

1052
00:51:28,586 --> 00:51:30,797
Is Nicolette and
her husband Will.

1053
00:51:30,880 --> 00:51:33,633
Are you kids hungry?
How much did you make?

1054
00:51:34,592 --> 00:51:36,760
Well, enough for two.

1055
00:51:38,012 --> 00:51:40,431
It's cold. That's too bad.

1056
00:51:44,936 --> 00:51:46,062
Please sit down.

1057
00:51:46,145 --> 00:51:47,188
Please. Would you
like to sit down?

1058
00:51:47,271 --> 00:51:48,271
Thank you.

1059
00:51:48,898 --> 00:51:50,900
You guys sit.

1060
00:51:51,943 --> 00:51:54,404
Uh, well, where are
you all coming from?

1061
00:51:54,487 --> 00:51:55,405
A potluck.

1062
00:51:55,488 --> 00:51:57,113
With no food.

1063
00:52:02,620 --> 00:52:04,622
Well, can I offer you, um...

1064
00:52:05,873 --> 00:52:08,376
something? Some... Anything?

1065
00:52:08,459 --> 00:52:10,169
No, no. We're stuffed.

1066
00:52:11,128 --> 00:52:12,128
You mind if I...

1067
00:52:21,264 --> 00:52:22,599
These are amazing.

1068
00:52:22,682 --> 00:52:24,392
Yeah, those are all Lou.

1069
00:52:26,936 --> 00:52:29,814
She's been making them just
like that since she was ten.

1070
00:52:31,315 --> 00:52:32,608
Since you were ten.

1071
00:52:33,985 --> 00:52:35,320
Oh, it's just a hobby.

1072
00:52:35,403 --> 00:52:37,155
Everybody needs one.

1073
00:52:37,238 --> 00:52:38,573
The worst times
in my life is when

1074
00:52:38,656 --> 00:52:40,950
I fell out of function
with my hobbies.

1075
00:52:41,033 --> 00:52:43,494
Yeah, and they've been
selling really good, too.

1076
00:52:46,205 --> 00:52:47,415
That one must be new.

1077
00:52:47,790 --> 00:52:50,001
Oh, it's... it's been
there for a month.

1078
00:52:51,919 --> 00:52:54,505
God is speaking through you.

1079
00:52:59,844 --> 00:53:01,596
I'm sorry.

1080
00:53:06,267 --> 00:53:09,061
That's Lou's father.
The original sheriff.

1081
00:53:09,687 --> 00:53:11,522
He passed away seven years ago.

1082
00:53:12,899 --> 00:53:14,025
You were with him.

1083
00:53:15,651 --> 00:53:18,696
His heart just stopped
in his chest, apparently.

1084
00:53:20,489 --> 00:53:22,241
Who knows if he could
have actually made it?

1085
00:53:23,576 --> 00:53:24,576
I do.

1086
00:53:25,912 --> 00:53:28,998
When my dad died, my
brain completely reset.

1087
00:53:30,374 --> 00:53:33,253
He was a civil engineer in DC,
working for the government.

1088
00:53:33,336 --> 00:53:35,755
Just like you're about
to, right? When you win?

1089
00:53:35,838 --> 00:53:37,965
Well, not... not
for the government.

1090
00:53:38,758 --> 00:53:39,759
For the people.

1091
00:53:40,384 --> 00:53:41,384
Is the idea.

1092
00:53:42,345 --> 00:53:45,348
Your brain reset how?

1093
00:53:45,431 --> 00:53:46,431
What does that mean?

1094
00:53:47,266 --> 00:53:48,517
Breakdown.

1095
00:53:49,060 --> 00:53:51,771
It took five years
experimental therapy

1096
00:53:51,854 --> 00:53:54,690
to unlock even just
fragments of memories.

1097
00:53:56,067 --> 00:53:58,653
Some of which were that I'd been
very effectively brainwashed.

1098
00:53:59,570 --> 00:54:00,738
We talked about this.

1099
00:54:02,865 --> 00:54:05,534
Um... What were the memories?

1100
00:54:10,206 --> 00:54:12,709
The memories are
of being gifted off

1101
00:54:12,792 --> 00:54:15,169
by my father, to his colleagues.

1102
00:54:16,879 --> 00:54:19,090
Who exactly they
were, I don't know.

1103
00:54:19,715 --> 00:54:21,300
I do know there
were ten other kids,

1104
00:54:22,426 --> 00:54:23,887
and we were taken to
a private forest grove

1105
00:54:23,970 --> 00:54:25,263
in Northern California

1106
00:54:25,346 --> 00:54:30,059
where we were stripped nude
and photographed and...

1107
00:54:31,018 --> 00:54:32,645
things I hope you can't imagine.

1108
00:54:33,896 --> 00:54:36,941
And then they released us,
and they hunted us down.

1109
00:54:37,483 --> 00:54:39,527
And I escaped.

1110
00:54:40,152 --> 00:54:41,487
I was the only one to escape.

1111
00:54:42,863 --> 00:54:47,285
And those are my memories,
which are now extremely vivid.

1112
00:54:47,368 --> 00:54:49,662
So if they were
hunting you down,

1113
00:54:49,745 --> 00:54:52,540
why would they release you?

1114
00:54:53,374 --> 00:54:56,043
The game was to catch us.

1115
00:54:58,170 --> 00:54:59,880
Well, okay.

1116
00:55:00,756 --> 00:55:04,343
Um, I want to be
respectful here.

1117
00:55:05,386 --> 00:55:08,389
Um, but I-I just...
I don't understand.

1118
00:55:08,472 --> 00:55:10,767
I mean, you... Who did this?

1119
00:55:10,850 --> 00:55:14,437
And... you were the
only one to escape?

1120
00:55:14,520 --> 00:55:15,688
You say you were a child.

1121
00:55:15,771 --> 00:55:17,898
Your question is to
make me feel shame.

1122
00:55:19,150 --> 00:55:21,068
I didn't escape on my
own. I couldn't have.

1123
00:55:23,446 --> 00:55:27,575
Joe, you want things
simple and neat.

1124
00:55:28,951 --> 00:55:30,954
You think that because
something's evil,

1125
00:55:31,037 --> 00:55:32,371
there can't be love.

1126
00:55:33,998 --> 00:55:35,291
When there is love,

1127
00:55:36,500 --> 00:55:37,877
that's the slavery.

1128
00:55:39,462 --> 00:55:40,838
And evil is sentimental.

1129
00:55:41,839 --> 00:55:43,383
And a predator can fall in love.

1130
00:55:43,466 --> 00:55:45,009
And he can help
his victim escape.

1131
00:55:46,260 --> 00:55:47,845
And I can't say his name...

1132
00:55:50,681 --> 00:55:52,767
But they called his
death an overdose

1133
00:55:52,850 --> 00:55:54,686
just five days
after he let me go

1134
00:55:54,769 --> 00:55:56,521
and my father, who sold me,

1135
00:55:56,604 --> 00:55:59,107
committed "suicide"
that same week.

1136
00:55:59,190 --> 00:56:00,233
I understand.

1137
00:56:00,316 --> 00:56:02,318
It is unbelievable. It
sounds insane to me,

1138
00:56:02,401 --> 00:56:04,153
just hearing it coming
out of my own mouth.

1139
00:56:04,236 --> 00:56:06,155
My brain still
hasn't truly accepted

1140
00:56:06,238 --> 00:56:08,558
that I'm actually talking about
things that happened to me.

1141
00:56:11,202 --> 00:56:12,745
Yes, it is, um,

1142
00:56:15,748 --> 00:56:16,916
hard to believe.

1143
00:56:17,541 --> 00:56:18,541
And...

1144
00:56:22,922 --> 00:56:25,758
I mean, I'm sorry.
I cannot imagine...

1145
00:56:25,841 --> 00:56:28,594
You can imagine. You know it.

1146
00:56:28,677 --> 00:56:30,430
It's easier to not get it.

1147
00:56:30,513 --> 00:56:31,597
It's evil.

1148
00:56:34,058 --> 00:56:35,726
Your father was sentimental.

1149
00:56:37,436 --> 00:56:38,604
Oh.

1150
00:56:39,063 --> 00:56:41,983
What does that mean?

1151
00:56:42,066 --> 00:56:43,401
We are in a fight against evil.

1152
00:56:43,484 --> 00:56:45,194
And part of that is
fighting against denial

1153
00:56:45,277 --> 00:56:46,403
and denying denial.

1154
00:56:46,737 --> 00:56:48,448
Now I just told you my story.

1155
00:56:48,531 --> 00:56:50,533
Will and Nicolette
helped each other

1156
00:56:50,616 --> 00:56:52,660
escape a ten-by-ten foot cellar

1157
00:56:52,743 --> 00:56:54,162
when they were pre-teens.

1158
00:56:54,245 --> 00:56:55,746
You go to Brussels next week.

1159
00:56:57,206 --> 00:56:58,583
Their testimony's under review

1160
00:56:58,666 --> 00:57:00,668
by the International Common
Law Court of Justice.

1161
00:57:00,751 --> 00:57:01,751
Evil!

1162
00:57:02,711 --> 00:57:03,963
If you want to know a society,

1163
00:57:04,046 --> 00:57:06,132
you look at what it
does to its children.

1164
00:57:06,715 --> 00:57:09,594
What you two went through?
What your daddy did?

1165
00:57:09,677 --> 00:57:12,472
Lou. Sometimes, baby,
it's just to listen.

1166
00:57:12,555 --> 00:57:14,390
You cannot just ignore!

1167
00:57:15,391 --> 00:57:18,519
The average pedophile abuses
between 50 and 100 children

1168
00:57:18,602 --> 00:57:20,813
in their lifetime! Per abuser!

1169
00:57:20,896 --> 00:57:23,107
And they keep these kids quiet

1170
00:57:23,190 --> 00:57:25,735
so that they think that
it's just... It's only them.

1171
00:57:25,818 --> 00:57:29,030
That it's this rare thing
that only happens to them.

1172
00:57:29,113 --> 00:57:32,575
And they do fill these kids
with shame because they...

1173
00:57:32,658 --> 00:57:34,077
they want them to
never even ask,

1174
00:57:34,160 --> 00:57:35,578
or never even realize

1175
00:57:35,661 --> 00:57:37,830
that maybe this happens so much

1176
00:57:37,913 --> 00:57:41,042
because there is this
whole entire network,

1177
00:57:41,125 --> 00:57:43,044
that maybe all these demons

1178
00:57:43,127 --> 00:57:45,671
-are in league with each other...
-Okay. Okay! That's enough!

1179
00:57:46,964 --> 00:57:49,049
I don't even know what
this is. I can't... No.

1180
00:57:49,842 --> 00:57:51,219
Last night was the same thing.

1181
00:57:51,302 --> 00:57:53,221
I've had two hours
sleep in two days.

1182
00:57:53,304 --> 00:57:56,224
I'm sorry, I can't
just let you turn this

1183
00:57:56,307 --> 00:57:58,808
-into a free-for-all.
-You know what that is.

1184
00:58:00,060 --> 00:58:01,562
It's at herself.

1185
00:58:09,945 --> 00:58:10,946
It's late.

1186
00:58:12,239 --> 00:58:13,490
I'm just going to wash this.

1187
00:58:40,559 --> 00:58:41,559
Hey.

1188
00:58:44,521 --> 00:58:45,521
Hm?

1189
00:58:51,028 --> 00:58:52,655
Can I ask you something?

1190
00:58:54,531 --> 00:58:55,741
Hm?

1191
00:58:57,368 --> 00:58:59,787
I-I've been meaning
to ask you...

1192
00:59:01,038 --> 00:59:03,457
And... And I won't ever again.

1193
00:59:06,502 --> 00:59:10,464
All those things that
you were saying outside?

1194
00:59:11,048 --> 00:59:13,592
Uh, all those things that you...

1195
00:59:15,219 --> 00:59:17,053
...the things you
were saying earlier?

1196
00:59:24,186 --> 00:59:26,355
Did your dad...

1197
00:59:29,400 --> 00:59:33,988
Did your dad... ever... t...

1198
00:59:36,615 --> 00:59:38,868
Or... Or... Or...

1199
00:59:38,951 --> 00:59:40,619
Or was it Ted?

1200
00:59:40,953 --> 00:59:42,037
Was it Ted?

1201
00:59:42,663 --> 00:59:44,165
Was that what it was?

1202
00:59:44,248 --> 00:59:45,374
Was it Ted?

1203
00:59:46,166 --> 00:59:47,793
Is that what it is?

1204
01:01:13,170 --> 01:01:14,255
Hello. Yeah.

1205
01:01:14,338 --> 01:01:15,256
Sheriff, the riots,
they're here.

1206
01:01:15,339 --> 01:01:16,299
They're on Broadway,
right outside.

1207
01:01:16,382 --> 01:01:17,466
What? Where? Where?

1208
01:01:17,549 --> 01:01:19,469
-You got to get over here.
-What? Where? Where?

1209
01:01:19,843 --> 01:01:20,970
They're on Broadway.
They're right outside.

1210
01:01:21,053 --> 01:01:22,763
We... We could use
your help over here.

1211
01:01:23,806 --> 01:01:26,267
-Hello?
-Where the hell are you?

1212
01:01:26,350 --> 01:01:28,102
All my goddamn windows
smashed to hell,

1213
01:01:28,185 --> 01:01:29,270
and I can't get a...

1214
01:01:29,353 --> 01:01:30,313
We got to just, obviously,

1215
01:01:30,396 --> 01:01:31,689
cancel this town hall.

1216
01:01:31,772 --> 01:01:33,733
-No. That is not obvious, Paula.
-Yes, it is.

1217
01:01:33,816 --> 01:01:35,443
This is a blip. We
will disperse it.

1218
01:01:35,526 --> 01:01:36,527
What's a blip?

1219
01:01:36,610 --> 01:01:38,237
Oh, no, my signs.

1220
01:01:38,320 --> 01:01:39,322
What's wrong?

1221
01:01:39,405 --> 01:01:42,241
Jesus!

1222
01:01:42,324 --> 01:01:45,036
Nothing. Dog in the road.
Dog in the road. Uh...

1223
01:01:45,119 --> 01:01:46,954
Damn. Uh, I'll call you back.

1224
01:01:47,037 --> 01:01:48,037
What?

1225
01:01:53,085 --> 01:01:54,211
The cops and the Klan

1226
01:01:54,294 --> 01:01:55,629
go hand in hand.

1227
01:01:55,712 --> 01:02:00,883
The cops and the
Klan go hand in hand.

1228
01:02:20,070 --> 01:02:21,072
Why aren't you out there?

1229
01:02:21,155 --> 01:02:21,989
I was, but they're filming.

1230
01:02:22,072 --> 01:02:23,199
Why do I even fucking
have you guys?

1231
01:02:23,282 --> 01:02:24,492
They're trying to use
us being out there

1232
01:02:24,575 --> 01:02:25,451
-to make it worse.
-Sheriff, I know. Okay?

1233
01:02:25,534 --> 01:02:27,536
I'm the one with
the speech tonight.

1234
01:02:27,619 --> 01:02:30,206
But my two deputies,
whose only job is this...

1235
01:02:30,289 --> 01:02:31,457
But Sheriff, I did...

1236
01:02:31,540 --> 01:02:33,042
...but how is it
that I'm the one...

1237
01:02:33,125 --> 01:02:34,335
-...going out there?
-I did go out there.

1238
01:02:34,418 --> 01:02:35,878
We went out there. We
both went out there.

1239
01:02:35,961 --> 01:02:37,046
Sheriff, there's
been new information,

1240
01:02:37,129 --> 01:02:38,422
and it changes
the way we engage.

1241
01:02:38,505 --> 01:02:40,383
It's simple, but
you got to see it.

1242
01:02:40,466 --> 01:02:42,093
Sheriff, they're just
trying to piss us off

1243
01:02:42,176 --> 01:02:44,260
so they can film us
and use it against us.

1244
01:02:49,099 --> 01:02:50,767
I know, Sheriff, it's
going to be fine.

1245
01:02:58,275 --> 01:02:59,193
No!

1246
01:02:59,276 --> 01:03:00,694
Ain't nobody coming
to protect us.

1247
01:03:00,777 --> 01:03:02,154
We got to start our own...

1248
01:03:02,237 --> 01:03:03,322
Shut the...

1249
01:03:03,405 --> 01:03:05,991
-Oh. You see it's not at all...
-Mike.

1250
01:03:06,074 --> 01:03:08,452
-...like fascists in Michigan.
-Do you understand this?

1251
01:03:08,535 --> 01:03:10,496
Do I understand what, Tooley?

1252
01:03:10,579 --> 01:03:12,164
I just know you were
dealing with it yesterday,

1253
01:03:12,247 --> 01:03:13,541
and I'm wondering why it's
ten times bigger today.

1254
01:03:13,624 --> 01:03:14,750
Yeah, with the Sheriff.

1255
01:03:14,833 --> 01:03:16,043
And it's ten times
bigger everywhere.

1256
01:03:16,126 --> 01:03:17,211
What the fuck?

1257
01:03:17,294 --> 01:03:18,879
Yeah, don't on purpose
misunderstand me, man.

1258
01:03:18,962 --> 01:03:20,589
I'm just asking you
a normal question.

1259
01:03:20,672 --> 01:03:22,258
What is going on?

1260
01:03:22,341 --> 01:03:25,594
There is a riot happening
right in front of your faces,

1261
01:03:25,677 --> 01:03:27,846
-and you're checking your email?
-I know! I know!

1262
01:03:29,932 --> 01:03:31,267
Sheriff, when we go in there,

1263
01:03:31,350 --> 01:03:32,393
we're going to need a
direction of clearing,

1264
01:03:32,476 --> 01:03:33,894
a direction of movement.

1265
01:03:33,977 --> 01:03:37,106
Look, we cannot let Paula shut
down the town hall. Please.

1266
01:03:37,189 --> 01:03:38,274
It's too important.

1267
01:03:38,357 --> 01:03:39,400
Sheriff, the state police say

1268
01:03:39,483 --> 01:03:40,693
they have no more
available units.

1269
01:03:40,776 --> 01:03:42,361
They've deployed
everybody to Albuquerque.

1270
01:03:42,444 --> 01:03:46,407
Listen. Stay cool.
Okay? And stay together.

1271
01:03:46,490 --> 01:03:47,699
Yes, sir.

1272
01:03:57,167 --> 01:04:00,129
Step over to the side for
your own safety, okay?

1273
01:04:00,212 --> 01:04:01,589
Our priority is your safety!

1274
01:04:01,672 --> 01:04:02,923
Step back.

1275
01:04:03,006 --> 01:04:05,634
-Please step out of the road!
-We understand your frustration.

1276
01:04:06,802 --> 01:04:09,555
We're trying to keep
you safe. Can you relax?

1277
01:04:09,638 --> 01:04:11,432
Hey! You can't do that! Hey!

1278
01:04:11,515 --> 01:04:14,101
Hey, back it up! Back it
up! Hey, can you stop?

1279
01:04:14,184 --> 01:04:15,311
We understand what
side you're on.

1280
01:04:15,394 --> 01:04:16,937
If you're gonna help,
stand over here, okay?

1281
01:04:17,020 --> 01:04:19,773
Everybody, for your own safety,

1282
01:04:19,856 --> 01:04:22,067
please get out of the street!

1283
01:04:22,150 --> 01:04:24,945
-We're a peaceful protest.
-You do not have a permit.

1284
01:04:25,028 --> 01:04:26,155
We don't need a permit.

1285
01:04:26,238 --> 01:04:27,907
Yes. You go to the county
commissioner's office.

1286
01:04:27,990 --> 01:04:29,116
We appreciate your service,

1287
01:04:29,199 --> 01:04:30,993
but we do not need
you guys today.

1288
01:04:31,076 --> 01:04:32,286
You need to have a permit

1289
01:04:32,369 --> 01:04:33,787
in order to be here in
the middle of the street.

1290
01:04:33,870 --> 01:04:34,955
Actually, this is
public property.

1291
01:04:35,038 --> 01:04:35,831
It's not safe...

1292
01:04:35,914 --> 01:04:37,291
Are you a lawyer or something?

1293
01:04:37,374 --> 01:04:39,001
-This is public property...
-Get up out of the...

1294
01:04:39,084 --> 01:04:42,336
...and the First Amendment says
we do have the right to convene.

1295
01:04:43,380 --> 01:04:46,008
Our institutions are
protecting murder!

1296
01:04:46,091 --> 01:04:49,011
Does your dad know that you're
out here creating this circus?

1297
01:04:49,094 --> 01:04:50,513
We're talking right
now on stolen land.

1298
01:04:50,596 --> 01:04:51,597
Stolen land!

1299
01:04:51,680 --> 01:04:52,848
Whose stolen land?
Stolen from who?

1300
01:04:52,931 --> 01:04:54,725
Yeah, and we're calling for
the defunding and abolition

1301
01:04:54,808 --> 01:04:56,435
of the corrupt and
homicidal police state.

1302
01:04:56,518 --> 01:04:57,811
Defunding?

1303
01:04:57,894 --> 01:04:59,522
What are you talking about?
Do you want to see my budget?

1304
01:04:59,605 --> 01:05:01,106
Yeah, I would... Don't put
your fucking hand on me!

1305
01:05:01,189 --> 01:05:02,525
I'll put my hand where I want.

1306
01:05:02,608 --> 01:05:04,652
Now listen here, you
little son of a bitch.

1307
01:05:04,735 --> 01:05:05,861
What the fuck?

1308
01:05:05,944 --> 01:05:07,695
Okay? You just need
to shut the fuck up!

1309
01:05:13,243 --> 01:05:15,913
Sheriff, look at this!

1310
01:05:15,996 --> 01:05:17,456
Look what they done.

1311
01:05:18,206 --> 01:05:20,084
Thousands of dollars
in goods they took.

1312
01:05:20,167 --> 01:05:22,919
John, I know. Now...

1313
01:05:23,545 --> 01:05:25,506
Maybe you shouldn't
put racist fucking

1314
01:05:25,589 --> 01:05:28,634
lawn jockeys in your
racist fucking store!

1315
01:05:28,717 --> 01:05:30,553
You fucking Nazi!

1316
01:05:30,636 --> 01:05:34,139
I'm a Nazi? You're fucking
destroying property!

1317
01:05:34,222 --> 01:05:36,892
Gloria? Oh, my
God, baby, it's me.

1318
01:05:36,975 --> 01:05:38,644
-Baby, it's Daddy. It's Daddy!
-Get the fuck away from me!

1319
01:05:38,727 --> 01:05:40,145
-Who the fuck are you?
-I'm so sorry.

1320
01:05:40,228 --> 01:05:42,523
-Get the fuck away from me!
-They took you!

1321
01:05:42,606 --> 01:05:44,692
They took you from me!

1322
01:05:44,775 --> 01:05:47,027
It's not my fault,
they took you from me.

1323
01:05:47,110 --> 01:05:48,529
Michael.

1324
01:05:48,612 --> 01:05:50,531
Do you just not even
care about what happened?

1325
01:05:50,614 --> 01:05:52,783
I'm seriously asking
you, not as a cop.

1326
01:05:53,742 --> 01:05:55,244
-Seriously.
-Yeah, it's an outrage.

1327
01:05:55,327 --> 01:05:56,453
It's a horrible incident.

1328
01:05:56,536 --> 01:05:58,122
Nobody hates fucking
bad cops more than cops.

1329
01:05:58,205 --> 01:06:01,208
Bad cops? Evil
fucking racist cops!

1330
01:06:01,291 --> 01:06:02,668
You're wearing the
uniform of a system

1331
01:06:02,751 --> 01:06:04,795
built on hundreds of years
of institutionalized racism!

1332
01:06:04,878 --> 01:06:06,255
You know you got Aryan
Nation boys with you?

1333
01:06:06,338 --> 01:06:07,256
-You know that, right?
-No! Fuck off! Michael.

1334
01:06:07,339 --> 01:06:08,966
Your family is fuckin'
ashamed of you!

1335
01:06:09,049 --> 01:06:12,011
Michael, not that. Can
I just say something?

1336
01:06:12,094 --> 01:06:15,389
You should be joining us! Do
you even know why you aren't?

1337
01:06:15,472 --> 01:06:18,475
This is... I know I have
not experienced racism,

1338
01:06:18,558 --> 01:06:20,436
but you... you have!

1339
01:06:20,519 --> 01:06:22,688
This is not my place!
This is not my fight!

1340
01:06:22,771 --> 01:06:24,273
I am a hypocrite.

1341
01:06:24,356 --> 01:06:26,108
I know that, but all I can do

1342
01:06:26,191 --> 01:06:29,236
is stand here and
fight for justice!

1343
01:06:29,319 --> 01:06:31,739
-So stand with us!
-Do us all a favor.

1344
01:06:31,822 --> 01:06:33,282
-I am so serious.
-Can you take a kneel?

1345
01:06:33,365 --> 01:06:34,533
Shut up. No.

1346
01:06:34,616 --> 01:06:36,410
Guy, do not engage!

1347
01:06:36,493 --> 01:06:38,621
Listen, you've got
to protect Paula's.

1348
01:06:38,704 --> 01:06:40,122
They're wrecking
everything, okay?

1349
01:06:40,205 --> 01:06:41,332
Get over there, right now!

1350
01:06:41,415 --> 01:06:43,040
-That is our priority.
-Yes, sir.

1351
01:06:48,338 --> 01:06:50,632
Police violence in Eddington!

1352
01:06:51,508 --> 01:06:57,556
Police violence in Eddington!
Police violence in Eddington!

1353
01:06:57,639 --> 01:07:00,642
Do you even know what
your dad really is?

1354
01:07:01,143 --> 01:07:02,978
Do you know what he has done?

1355
01:07:03,854 --> 01:07:04,980
You mean to your wife?

1356
01:07:06,481 --> 01:07:07,858
-What?
-What?

1357
01:07:08,942 --> 01:07:10,444
What about your mother?

1358
01:07:10,527 --> 01:07:12,488
Where is she? Huh?

1359
01:07:12,571 --> 01:07:14,156
Do you ask these questions?

1360
01:07:14,698 --> 01:07:16,784
What about your fucking
crazy whore wife?

1361
01:07:16,867 --> 01:07:18,494
Her bat shit mom
sending crazy shit

1362
01:07:18,577 --> 01:07:20,120
to my house my whole life!

1363
01:07:20,203 --> 01:07:21,871
Maybe that had
something to do with it!

1364
01:07:25,876 --> 01:07:29,880
I was just trying to
explain the situation here.

1365
01:07:29,963 --> 01:07:32,549
Okay? Everything is...
Everybody calm down!

1366
01:07:32,632 --> 01:07:37,304
Everyone! 8 minutes and 46
seconds on the ground now.

1367
01:07:37,387 --> 01:07:38,472
Calm down!

1368
01:07:40,891 --> 01:07:43,226
Yeah. Now this is
how you do a protest.

1369
01:07:47,647 --> 01:07:49,858
John, I will be right back.

1370
01:07:49,941 --> 01:07:51,276
Yeah, right.

1371
01:07:51,359 --> 01:07:52,527
Were you even here?

1372
01:07:54,905 --> 01:07:56,031
Okay.

1373
01:07:56,114 --> 01:07:57,700
Hey, what these people want...

1374
01:07:57,783 --> 01:07:59,535
-Pardon me.
-...will not stop.

1375
01:07:59,618 --> 01:08:01,161
This is a good message.

1376
01:08:01,244 --> 01:08:05,082
This is good. Peaceful.
No more violence.

1377
01:08:05,165 --> 01:08:06,333
It doesn't end
until they pull you

1378
01:08:06,416 --> 01:08:07,501
out of your bed in the
middle of the night...

1379
01:08:07,584 --> 01:08:08,669
No violence, just peace.

1380
01:08:08,752 --> 01:08:09,878
...and who are
you going to call?

1381
01:08:09,961 --> 01:08:11,171
-But the violence...
-What the hell?

1382
01:08:11,254 --> 01:08:13,340
...the violence just angers me.

1383
01:08:13,423 --> 01:08:14,550
You want to defund the police?

1384
01:08:14,633 --> 01:08:16,719
There won't be any
police there to call.

1385
01:08:16,802 --> 01:08:18,053
Hell yeah, brother.

1386
01:08:18,136 --> 01:08:21,682
And if the people go home and
get their guns and come in,

1387
01:08:21,765 --> 01:08:25,477
and the threat sees
this, they will leave.

1388
01:08:25,560 --> 01:08:26,854
They will leave.

1389
01:08:26,937 --> 01:08:28,537
-Go home and think about it.
-Peaceful!

1390
01:08:28,814 --> 01:08:32,107
Shit, shit, shit. Fucking shit.

1391
01:08:34,110 --> 01:08:35,195
Yes. Okay.

1392
01:08:35,278 --> 01:08:36,947
Yes. Damn.

1393
01:08:37,948 --> 01:08:40,075
Hey there, everyone. Hey.

1394
01:08:40,158 --> 01:08:43,579
Well, this is nice
to see. Finally, huh?

1395
01:08:43,662 --> 01:08:44,747
Dining together.

1396
01:08:44,830 --> 01:08:47,249
Community. I almost
forgot what this was like.

1397
01:08:47,332 --> 01:08:50,419
Paula, thank you so
much for opening it up.

1398
01:08:50,502 --> 01:08:52,838
It's so good to see
everybody. Yeah.

1399
01:08:53,255 --> 01:08:55,423
Hey there, Ralph. It's, uh...

1400
01:08:56,007 --> 01:08:58,009
Real good to see everyone. Hey.

1401
01:08:59,135 --> 01:09:00,135
Um...

1402
01:09:02,180 --> 01:09:03,557
Well...

1403
01:09:04,516 --> 01:09:05,809
Uh...

1404
01:09:08,728 --> 01:09:12,024
I was hoping for
a better turnout.

1405
01:09:12,107 --> 01:09:13,107
But, um...

1406
01:09:15,485 --> 01:09:17,321
But how's anyone
supposed to get here

1407
01:09:17,404 --> 01:09:19,239
when you got to
wade through that?

1408
01:09:20,240 --> 01:09:23,660
And my deputies are-are
keeping it safe.

1409
01:09:24,578 --> 01:09:25,620
Uh...

1410
01:09:27,163 --> 01:09:30,459
And yes, these protests,
it's a real thing, okay?

1411
01:09:30,542 --> 01:09:33,170
There is an imbalance
in this country.

1412
01:09:33,253 --> 01:09:35,589
And what happened to
that man... undefensible.

1413
01:09:35,672 --> 01:09:38,217
Absolutely disgraceful conduct.

1414
01:09:38,300 --> 01:09:40,761
But I am not the
problem here. Okay?

1415
01:09:40,844 --> 01:09:42,470
And if... if you believe that...

1416
01:09:43,221 --> 01:09:46,975
d-do you really think that
the power is with the police?

1417
01:09:48,643 --> 01:09:50,187
It's the leadership.

1418
01:09:50,270 --> 01:09:54,608
The... The power is with the
leadership of this country

1419
01:09:54,691 --> 01:09:58,570
on down to the leadership
of this community.

1420
01:09:58,653 --> 01:10:01,823
Okay? Now do you want
to talk about brutality?

1421
01:10:03,325 --> 01:10:06,954
I have kept this town safe for
the better half of my life,

1422
01:10:07,037 --> 01:10:12,835
but if there is one thing
that I feel shame about,

1423
01:10:12,918 --> 01:10:16,171
truly, it is in keeping quiet

1424
01:10:16,254 --> 01:10:19,883
about something that
I shouldn't have.

1425
01:10:20,550 --> 01:10:22,761
Okay? About Ted Garcia.

1426
01:10:22,844 --> 01:10:24,012
Our mayor.

1427
01:10:24,554 --> 01:10:27,266
Because the man is...

1428
01:10:27,349 --> 01:10:29,893
purely and simply...

1429
01:10:32,395 --> 01:10:34,356
a predator.

1430
01:10:36,399 --> 01:10:40,987
Okay? Yes. Ted Garcia
is a sexual predator.

1431
01:10:42,572 --> 01:10:46,118
I know. I see your
faces. I know, okay?

1432
01:10:46,201 --> 01:10:47,369
How do I know this?

1433
01:10:47,452 --> 01:10:49,663
Well, I should know this.

1434
01:10:50,246 --> 01:10:53,876
My wife, when she
was 16 years old...

1435
01:10:53,959 --> 01:10:56,044
he gets her pregnant.

1436
01:10:56,127 --> 01:10:58,297
Forces her to abort.

1437
01:10:58,380 --> 01:11:02,050
Tiny little innocent
baby. Murdered.

1438
01:11:02,676 --> 01:11:06,054
And Ted turns his back.
Her life is ruined.

1439
01:11:06,596 --> 01:11:10,017
Ted's life? Ooh. Well,
he's off to the races.

1440
01:11:10,100 --> 01:11:11,476
And for what?

1441
01:11:12,727 --> 01:11:15,564
Well, you vote him
back into office,

1442
01:11:15,647 --> 01:11:17,607
and you're going to
find out for what.

1443
01:11:18,483 --> 01:11:21,695
Okay? And you look
to his own wife.

1444
01:11:21,778 --> 01:11:23,822
But you can't. Why?

1445
01:11:23,905 --> 01:11:25,574
Because she's gone. Took off.

1446
01:11:25,657 --> 01:11:27,701
Okay, now that is
none of my business.

1447
01:11:27,784 --> 01:11:30,078
I can only speculate why.

1448
01:11:30,161 --> 01:11:32,414
But let me tell you something.
You look to history.

1449
01:11:32,497 --> 01:11:36,125
And what that man did to
my wife, my darling...

1450
01:11:37,669 --> 01:11:40,005
Let me tell you something.
That is predator behavior.

1451
01:11:40,088 --> 01:11:43,967
It is, okay? And what's worse...

1452
01:11:44,592 --> 01:11:45,677
is it's...

1453
01:11:48,346 --> 01:11:49,346
It's...

1454
01:11:52,100 --> 01:11:53,143
It's rape.

1455
01:11:54,352 --> 01:11:55,895
Let's call it what it is.

1456
01:11:56,938 --> 01:11:58,481
Let's face it. Statutory.

1457
01:12:00,150 --> 01:12:03,278
Ted Garcia. Let's
call him what he is.

1458
01:12:03,778 --> 01:12:05,072
And we're saying it,

1459
01:12:05,155 --> 01:12:08,867
and we're going to be saying it
in the days and the weeks ahead.

1460
01:12:08,950 --> 01:12:11,411
Because that is what
this election is about.

1461
01:12:11,494 --> 01:12:14,914
So you vote Joe Cross.
Take back our community.

1462
01:12:17,542 --> 01:12:19,210
Save our soul.

1463
01:12:26,760 --> 01:12:27,760
Thank you.

1464
01:12:28,136 --> 01:12:29,763
Wow. Good?

1465
01:12:30,555 --> 01:12:31,765
Post it.

1466
01:12:31,848 --> 01:12:33,391
Okay. You sure?

1467
01:12:35,226 --> 01:12:37,145
Just don't make
me think. Post it.

1468
01:12:38,563 --> 01:12:40,023
Stand up, fight back!

1469
01:12:40,106 --> 01:12:41,525
-What do we want?
-Justice!

1470
01:12:41,608 --> 01:12:43,276
-When do we want it?
-Now!

1471
01:12:43,359 --> 01:12:44,820
If we don't get it...

1472
01:12:44,903 --> 01:12:46,279
Shut it down!

1473
01:12:46,362 --> 01:12:47,948
If we don't get it...

1474
01:12:48,031 --> 01:12:56,031
Shut it down! Shut it down!

1475
01:13:07,842 --> 01:13:09,302
...did not let
Ethereum's price fall

1476
01:13:09,385 --> 01:13:10,971
below $201 level.

1477
01:13:11,054 --> 01:13:12,305
Ethereum is trading much above

1478
01:13:12,388 --> 01:13:14,724
its 20-day exponential
moving average.

1479
01:14:08,611 --> 01:14:09,611
Baby?

1480
01:14:12,657 --> 01:14:16,202
I-I had to. He cannot
get away with it.

1481
01:14:24,794 --> 01:14:26,546
Baby, is that for here?

1482
01:14:39,267 --> 01:14:40,435
Please...

1483
01:14:41,477 --> 01:14:42,645
Please...

1484
01:15:13,676 --> 01:15:15,011
Have a good night, brother.

1485
01:15:38,868 --> 01:15:40,829
The way you did it is repugnant,

1486
01:15:40,912 --> 01:15:42,789
but tonight's the
most you've ever done

1487
01:15:42,872 --> 01:15:44,707
for that girl in your life.

1488
01:15:45,625 --> 01:15:47,877
Whether she sees it
or not, I don't know.

1489
01:16:08,022 --> 01:16:09,899
Yeah, this is my
fourth message now.

1490
01:16:12,193 --> 01:16:13,736
What you done today...

1491
01:16:14,821 --> 01:16:17,365
no matter what excuse
you come up with,

1492
01:16:17,448 --> 01:16:19,159
no matter when you
come to your senses,

1493
01:16:19,242 --> 01:16:22,036
you have wrought
destruction upon our home,

1494
01:16:22,578 --> 01:16:25,332
and upon me, and on Facebook...

1495
01:16:25,415 --> 01:16:28,168
With words that don't even...

1496
01:16:28,251 --> 01:16:31,463
I... What are you saying?
Your life is a fiction?

1497
01:16:31,546 --> 01:16:33,506
So who then? Who is your abuser?

1498
01:16:33,589 --> 01:16:35,884
Am I? You say the name

1499
01:16:35,967 --> 01:16:38,470
if you call me a liar,
your mother a liar.

1500
01:16:38,553 --> 01:16:41,056
With no warning and no honesty.

1501
01:16:41,139 --> 01:16:42,181
Just poison.

1502
01:16:43,641 --> 01:16:44,641
Bitch!

1503
01:17:00,450 --> 01:17:02,994
The name I have now
is Louise Cross.

1504
01:17:03,786 --> 01:17:05,705
I was born Louise Bodkin.

1505
01:17:06,581 --> 01:17:07,999
And I am speaking now

1506
01:17:08,082 --> 01:17:11,086
to deny my husband's
announcement yesterday,

1507
01:17:11,169 --> 01:17:15,131
which was false, and a
falsification of my true life.

1508
01:17:16,299 --> 01:17:19,552
I was abused, but
not by Ted Garcia.

1509
01:17:20,595 --> 01:17:23,181
That is a fiction
invented by my mother

1510
01:17:23,264 --> 01:17:26,309
and kept alive by
her and my husband.

1511
01:17:26,392 --> 01:17:29,938
But it is not my shame,
it is my abuser's.

1512
01:17:30,021 --> 01:17:32,398
And he was one of millions.

1513
01:17:32,857 --> 01:17:34,901
I am one of millions.

1514
01:17:35,860 --> 01:17:37,569
We are not a coincidence.

1515
01:17:44,827 --> 01:17:46,954
Hey, Sheriff. You okay?

1516
01:17:47,663 --> 01:17:49,749
Sheriff, we got a noise
complaint on the mayor's house.

1517
01:17:49,832 --> 01:17:51,959
I guess he's doing
a-a fundraiser.

1518
01:17:52,543 --> 01:17:55,004
Is it too touchy?
Do we leave it?

1519
01:17:56,005 --> 01:17:57,256
We do leave it, right?

1520
01:17:58,091 --> 01:17:59,300
Yeah, of course we do.

1521
01:18:45,304 --> 01:18:46,304
Sheriff?

1522
01:18:47,390 --> 01:18:48,850

01:22:49,340 --> 01:22:50,883
You put this in me.

1560
01:22:53,177 --> 01:22:58,015
No. I was holding her hand. No.

1561
01:22:59,308 --> 01:23:01,477
It was right after ballet class.

1562
01:23:01,560 --> 01:23:04,397
She said, "Bread
pudding, bread pudding."

1563
01:23:04,855 --> 01:23:06,816
I said, "No, baby, no.

1564
01:23:06,899 --> 01:23:09,652
I can't get you dessert.
I can't get you dessert."

1565
01:23:09,735 --> 01:23:11,904
Why'd you let go of my hand?

1566
01:23:11,987 --> 01:23:13,863
I was still holding your hand!

1567
01:23:20,788 --> 01:23:22,248
It tastes the same.

1568
01:23:24,667 --> 01:23:26,252
Just tastes the same.

1569
01:23:26,335 --> 01:23:28,796
Wine into water.

1570
01:23:29,588 --> 01:23:31,507
Wine into water, wickedness.

1571
01:23:31,590 --> 01:23:33,926
Wickedness! Wickedness!

1572
01:23:34,009 --> 01:23:35,928
Why?

1573
01:23:37,388 --> 01:23:38,765
You poisoning me?

1574
01:23:38,848 --> 01:23:41,517
I'll poison you!
I'll poison you!

1575
01:23:42,685 --> 01:23:45,146
I'll pump in your guts!

1576
01:23:45,229 --> 01:23:46,897
I will pump until you blow up!

1577
01:23:47,314 --> 01:23:48,608
I'll infect your home!

1578
01:23:48,691 --> 01:23:50,900
I'll infect you
from the outside.

1579
01:23:52,403 --> 01:23:54,864
You want me dead?
You want me dead?

1580
01:23:55,865 --> 01:23:58,075
You want me dead?

1581
01:23:59,076 --> 01:24:00,953
I'll be the death of you!

1582
01:24:02,204 --> 01:24:06,292
You devils! You
called this plague!

1583
01:24:06,375 --> 01:24:10,837
You don't want me. You
don't care about me.

1584
01:24:12,923 --> 01:24:15,508
Give her back. Give her back.

1585
01:26:18,674 --> 01:26:19,674
Eric?

1586
01:26:21,010 --> 01:26:22,303
Yeah?

1587
01:26:22,386 --> 01:26:24,763
I thought we agreed absolutely
no one in the house.

1588
01:26:25,848 --> 01:26:28,267
-Yeah, I know.
-So what's this purse?

1589
01:26:30,227 --> 01:26:31,687
What purse?

1590
01:26:31,770 --> 01:26:33,314
Come here and look
at what purse.

1591
01:26:33,397 --> 01:26:35,399
You think I didn't see
you with that little girl?

1592
01:26:39,695 --> 01:26:41,572
Eric, you should be...

1593
01:26:50,372 --> 01:26:51,372
Dad?

1594
01:29:43,545 --> 01:29:46,007
Hi, you've reached
Louise. Leave a message.

1595
01:29:46,090 --> 01:29:48,008
Hey, Rabbit.

1596
01:30:18,705 --> 01:30:19,707
ID?

1597
01:30:19,790 --> 01:30:21,751
I was exposed to somebody
a few nights ago,

1598
01:30:21,834 --> 01:30:24,001
and he definitely had it...

1599
01:30:42,146 --> 01:30:43,146
Yeah?

1600
01:31:08,338 --> 01:31:09,423
Sheriff.

1601
01:31:11,592 --> 01:31:13,093
You need to be ready.

1602
01:31:14,136 --> 01:31:15,888
It's really bad.

1603
01:31:17,514 --> 01:31:19,933
But I think you
might be Mayor now.

1604
01:31:22,060 --> 01:31:23,520
Who-Who's that?

1605
01:31:24,271 --> 01:31:27,608
Oh. He's new. I think that's
the next door property.

1606
01:31:27,691 --> 01:31:30,277
Is that Brian? His friend?

1607
01:31:30,360 --> 01:31:31,570
Whose friend?

1608
01:31:34,156 --> 01:31:35,741
Yeah, must be a neighbor.

1609
01:31:37,075 --> 01:31:38,619
And...

1610
01:31:41,872 --> 01:31:43,415
Well, hi, Tam.

1611
01:31:43,498 --> 01:31:44,792
She found the body.

1612
01:31:44,875 --> 01:31:45,875
Hey, Sheriff.

1613
01:31:47,294 --> 01:31:48,796
You found it?

1614
01:31:48,879 --> 01:31:52,258
Yeah, I did, Sheriff. I-I
called you as soon as I could.

1615
01:31:52,341 --> 01:31:54,593
I didn't go in, but Sammy
broke off from my walk,

1616
01:31:54,676 --> 01:31:56,137
and he went in,

1617
01:31:56,220 --> 01:31:58,347
and I tried to get him
back as soon as I could,

1618
01:31:58,430 --> 01:32:00,975
but he was in there and I
think he was licking things.

1619
01:32:01,058 --> 01:32:02,351
And I tried to get
him back, and...

1620
01:32:02,434 --> 01:32:03,435
Okay.

1621
01:32:03,518 --> 01:32:05,812
-I called you. I'm sorry.
-What is that?

1622
01:32:06,396 --> 01:32:07,606
Yeah, she called them, too.

1623
01:32:07,689 --> 01:32:09,900
Well, just in case they
needed to see. I...

1624
01:32:09,983 --> 01:32:11,025
See what?

1625
01:32:12,694 --> 01:32:13,737
They have been waiting outside.

1626
01:32:13,820 --> 01:32:15,447
I guess this is
the Pueblo border.

1627
01:32:15,530 --> 01:32:17,992
No, this is not. Negative.

1628
01:32:18,075 --> 01:32:20,661
-I think it is, though.
-It is.

1629
01:32:21,536 --> 01:32:23,330
We're on the county line.
This is Sevilla County.

1630
01:32:23,413 --> 01:32:24,957
But on the other side of
the house, that's Pueblo.

1631
01:32:25,040 --> 01:32:26,333
It's the same at mine.

1632
01:32:40,514 --> 01:32:41,724
Oh.

1633
01:32:41,807 --> 01:32:43,100
Is that Butterfly?

1634
01:32:43,183 --> 01:32:45,144
Yeah, Detective Butterballs.

1635
01:32:45,227 --> 01:32:47,521
And that's the Pueblo
Sheriff down here.

1636
01:32:47,604 --> 01:32:48,856
Pueblos don't have sheriffs.

1637
01:32:48,939 --> 01:32:50,399
He's not even police.

1638
01:32:50,482 --> 01:32:52,318
But he goes around
and blesses shit.

1639
01:32:52,401 --> 01:32:54,570
Apparently he's in charge
of all Pueblo matters.

1640
01:32:54,653 --> 01:32:56,071
This is not a Pueblo matter.

1641
01:32:56,154 --> 01:32:57,740
-I know.
-We are Eddington.

1642
01:32:57,823 --> 01:32:59,449
This is Eddington.

1643
01:33:16,425 --> 01:33:18,135
Well, what the hell is that?

1644
01:33:19,011 --> 01:33:20,971
There's been more
lootings in town, too.

1645
01:33:21,471 --> 01:33:23,015
Shops all smashed up.

1646
01:33:23,098 --> 01:33:24,558
That's BLM talk.

1647
01:33:24,641 --> 01:33:26,477
You've secured the
search warrant, right?

1648
01:33:26,560 --> 01:33:28,395
I did. It has been signed.

1649
01:33:28,478 --> 01:33:29,758
I got a runner bringing it down.

1650
01:33:30,564 --> 01:33:34,318
Mm-hmm. And, uh, what about OMI?

1651
01:33:34,401 --> 01:33:36,111
I didn't want to call
them until you got here.

1652
01:33:36,194 --> 01:33:37,821
I called them.
They're on their way.

1653
01:33:38,947 --> 01:33:40,157
Needle in a
haystack, but I found

1654
01:33:40,240 --> 01:33:41,950
a single five-five-six casing.

1655
01:33:43,452 --> 01:33:45,371
Uh, okay.

1656
01:33:45,454 --> 01:33:46,872
Well, what...

1657
01:33:46,955 --> 01:33:48,665
Just put it right
there on the counter.

1658
01:33:49,791 --> 01:33:51,918
Uh, how... how many
impacts you count?

1659
01:33:53,211 --> 01:33:54,546
Well, don't worry about it.

1660
01:33:56,506 --> 01:33:59,593
I-I also found good quality
tire tracks back there.

1661
01:33:59,676 --> 01:34:01,303
Truck or SUV.

1662
01:34:02,262 --> 01:34:03,514
What are you even doing here?

1663
01:34:03,597 --> 01:34:05,849
This is our crime scene, and
you are contaminating it.

1664
01:34:05,932 --> 01:34:07,309
Now get out of here!

1665
01:34:11,813 --> 01:34:17,069
Okay, let's focus.
DRT here. DRT there.

1666
01:34:17,152 --> 01:34:19,113
Sheriff, I tried to
get some CCTV footage.

1667
01:34:19,196 --> 01:34:20,531
Hard-drive got took.

1668
01:34:20,614 --> 01:34:22,825
Bless you.

1669
01:34:22,908 --> 01:34:24,702
That's for a handwriting expert.

1670
01:34:24,785 --> 01:34:25,953
Look... Look at those "E" s.

1671
01:34:26,036 --> 01:34:27,413
Uh-huh. Okay,

1672
01:34:27,496 --> 01:34:29,581
but, well, look at this. Now
what is this? A ladies purse?

1673
01:34:29,664 --> 01:34:31,458
-Guy, would you come help?
-Yup.

1674
01:34:31,541 --> 01:34:32,709
This here...

1675
01:34:35,670 --> 01:34:37,589
Whoa, whoa. What are you doing?

1676
01:34:37,672 --> 01:34:38,799
Forensics.

1677
01:34:39,841 --> 01:34:40,841
Ah, shit.

1678
01:34:42,094 --> 01:34:44,930
Well, it's compromised,
it's too late. Go ahead.

1679
01:34:45,013 --> 01:34:46,265
I'm getting to be really happy

1680
01:34:46,348 --> 01:34:47,433
you guys don't help
us with jack shit.

1681
01:34:47,516 --> 01:34:49,101
Oh, but now you want to help us.

1682
01:34:49,184 --> 01:34:50,602
With all your resources?

1683
01:34:50,685 --> 01:34:51,770
Same resources as you.

1684
01:34:51,853 --> 01:34:53,605
-More technology, more people.
-Sarah Allen.

1685
01:34:53,688 --> 01:34:55,107
-We've got gloves.
-Born 2001.

1686
01:34:55,190 --> 01:34:56,150
That's the girl
that was shrieking

1687
01:34:56,233 --> 01:34:57,234
at you during the riot.

1688
01:34:58,360 --> 01:34:59,778
Look, she's got the
Blacks Lives Matters pin.

1689
01:34:59,861 --> 01:35:02,072
All of this is getting
thrown out now.

1690
01:35:02,155 --> 01:35:03,490
You understand that?

1691
01:35:03,573 --> 01:35:05,451
Unless you find a judge
even stupider than this one.

1692
01:35:05,534 --> 01:35:06,994
Hey, don't you have some
sort of alcoholic domestic

1693
01:35:07,077 --> 01:35:08,454
at one of your casinos?

1694
01:35:08,537 --> 01:35:09,830
This ain't yours, man.

1695
01:35:09,913 --> 01:35:12,416
The shooter's on tribal
ground. This is a Pueblo case.

1696
01:35:12,499 --> 01:35:15,127
Give me your evidence
and get on down the road.

1697
01:35:15,210 --> 01:35:16,670
Victim was here, okay?

1698
01:35:16,753 --> 01:35:18,339
This is where the
harm was committed.

1699
01:35:18,422 --> 01:35:19,423
This is our case.

1700
01:35:19,506 --> 01:35:20,966
Well, we got the shell casing.

1701
01:35:21,049 --> 01:35:22,009
Congratulations!

1702
01:35:22,092 --> 01:35:23,886
Do what you want with
the shell casings.

1703
01:35:23,969 --> 01:35:25,429
There is no cross
commission here.

1704
01:35:25,846 --> 01:35:27,931
We respect your sovereignty.
Respect ours now.

1705
01:35:28,014 --> 01:35:29,099
Oh, you respect our sovereignty?

1706
01:35:29,182 --> 01:35:31,143
Okay, let's call
the Feds and the BIA

1707
01:35:31,226 --> 01:35:32,727
and see what they
want to do. Easy.

1708
01:35:33,728 --> 01:35:36,315
Okay. Uh... Let's, um,

1709
01:35:36,398 --> 01:35:37,983
go talk to this Sarah
Allen because I...

1710
01:35:38,066 --> 01:35:40,027
All right. Well, we're
going to take it from here.

1711
01:35:40,110 --> 01:35:41,487
Don't let him dink
with the crime scene.

1712
01:35:41,570 --> 01:35:43,989
What crime scene?
It's your toilet now.

1713
01:35:44,072 --> 01:35:47,701
Officer Jimenez, can you
please leave the property?

1714
01:35:47,784 --> 01:35:49,119
Watch how you approach me.

1715
01:35:49,202 --> 01:35:51,622
Okay, so you were there
with your boyfriend...

1716
01:35:51,705 --> 01:35:53,832
He's... He's not my boy...
He wasn't my boyfriend.

1717
01:35:53,915 --> 01:35:56,168
-I barely even knew him.
-Okay, you're in his house...

1718
01:35:56,251 --> 01:35:58,420
-I was hardly there.
-You were in his house.

1719
01:35:58,503 --> 01:36:01,715
And then later that night,
he's dead, his dad is dead.

1720
01:36:01,798 --> 01:36:04,927
Are they... Are they really
dead? Like how do you know?

1721
01:36:05,010 --> 01:36:07,721
Yeah, well, we were
there. They are deceased.

1722
01:36:08,138 --> 01:36:10,808
And, um... And your
purse is there.

1723
01:36:10,891 --> 01:36:12,351
Sarah, we went
through your socials.

1724
01:36:12,434 --> 01:36:14,019
You didn't do yourself
any-all favors.

1725
01:36:14,102 --> 01:36:15,020
I'm not trying to...

1726
01:36:15,103 --> 01:36:16,730
For example, here's
a quote, from you.

1727
01:36:17,314 --> 01:36:19,983
Uh, "Free your communities,
arm yourselves..."

1728
01:36:20,066 --> 01:36:21,693
No, that's completely
taken out of...

1729
01:36:21,776 --> 01:36:23,737
I don't... I don't mean
literal arms. That's not...

1730
01:36:23,820 --> 01:36:25,364
It's preaching
rioting and looting.

1731
01:36:25,447 --> 01:36:27,408
Do you know, being an
accessory to terrorism...

1732
01:36:27,491 --> 01:36:28,575
I'm not a part of any terrorism.

1733
01:36:28,658 --> 01:36:30,077
...is terrorism.

1734
01:36:30,160 --> 01:36:32,663
That doesn't make... The looters
and rioters, they are separate!

1735
01:36:32,746 --> 01:36:35,249
I'm not any part of that, and
none of the protesters are.

1736
01:36:35,332 --> 01:36:37,668
The rioters, they're being
planted by the Right.

1737
01:36:37,751 --> 01:36:39,169
They're trying to make it
look like it's the protesters

1738
01:36:39,252 --> 01:36:41,255
so that scared old white
people won't complain

1739
01:36:41,338 --> 01:36:42,838
when Martial law happens!

1740
01:36:46,426 --> 01:36:48,762
Uh, good afternoon,
ladies and gentlemen.

1741
01:36:48,845 --> 01:36:52,349
My name is Joe
Cross. Joseph Cross.

1742
01:36:52,432 --> 01:36:54,059
Sheriff of Sevilla County.

1743
01:36:54,893 --> 01:36:58,313
Last night around midnight,

1744
01:36:58,396 --> 01:37:02,526
Mayor Ted Garcia and
his son, Eric Garcia,

1745
01:37:02,609 --> 01:37:06,447
were struck down by
cowardly sniper fire.

1746
01:37:06,530 --> 01:37:09,616
Now, I do believe we
have sufficient evidence

1747
01:37:09,699 --> 01:37:14,079
to believe that the perpetrator
was a member... or members...

1748
01:37:14,162 --> 01:37:17,415
of the Antifa terrorist group,

1749
01:37:18,124 --> 01:37:20,502
capitalizing on the
recent tragic events

1750
01:37:20,585 --> 01:37:22,546
in Minneapolis to sow chaos.

1751
01:37:23,046 --> 01:37:25,715
Now, to the criminals
that committed this act:

1752
01:37:26,424 --> 01:37:28,135
you will soon find out

1753
01:37:28,218 --> 01:37:31,305
what justice looks
like in Sevilla County.

1754
01:37:31,388 --> 01:37:34,516
You will find out. It
will not be tolerated.

1755
01:37:35,392 --> 01:37:38,645
And now a personal
message to the individuals

1756
01:37:38,728 --> 01:37:41,231
planning to take
their criminal conduct

1757
01:37:41,314 --> 01:37:43,608
out of the streets and
into the neighborhoods.

1758
01:37:44,067 --> 01:37:45,777
I would tell them:

1759
01:37:45,860 --> 01:37:50,323
if you value your life,
you should think twice,

1760
01:37:50,949 --> 01:37:54,328
because the people of
Eddington like guns.

1761
01:37:54,411 --> 01:37:57,623
And I encourage
them to own guns,

1762
01:37:57,706 --> 01:38:00,000
and they're going to be
in their homes tonight

1763
01:38:00,083 --> 01:38:02,335
with their guns loaded.

1764
01:38:02,836 --> 01:38:06,465
And if you try to break
into their homes to steal,

1765
01:38:06,548 --> 01:38:11,178
to set fire, to commit
physical injury and/or death,

1766
01:38:11,261 --> 01:38:13,347
then I'm highly recommending

1767
01:38:13,430 --> 01:38:15,390
that they blow you
out of their homes

1768
01:38:15,473 --> 01:38:17,142
with their guns.

1769
01:38:19,019 --> 01:38:20,145
Eddington, New Mexico,

1770
01:38:20,228 --> 01:38:21,813
despite its meager population,

1771
01:38:21,896 --> 01:38:24,983
is quickly being co-opted
in online circles

1772
01:38:25,066 --> 01:38:27,444
as a poster town
for anti-government,

1773
01:38:27,527 --> 01:38:29,196
anti-police violence.

1774
01:38:29,279 --> 01:38:32,533
Meanwhile, Albuquerque's new
public safety department,

1775
01:38:32,616 --> 01:38:35,494
designed to relieve stress
on the city's police,

1776
01:38:35,577 --> 01:38:37,496
will deploy unarmed personnel

1777
01:38:37,579 --> 01:38:39,164
made up of social workers,

1778
01:38:39,247 --> 01:38:41,250
housing and
homelessness specialists

1779
01:38:41,333 --> 01:38:44,127
and violence prevention
coordinators...

1780
01:39:41,768 --> 01:39:43,312
Ooh.

1781
01:39:43,395 --> 01:39:44,437
Thank you.

1782
01:39:52,070 --> 01:39:54,447
I had to post a whole
statement against her video.

1783
01:39:56,157 --> 01:39:57,909
And her phone's not ringing.

1784
01:40:01,162 --> 01:40:03,248
Vernon blocked me.

1785
01:40:05,458 --> 01:40:08,086
Can you try her again and
see if it rings for you?

1786
01:40:10,505 --> 01:40:12,465
I've been trying.

1787
01:40:13,216 --> 01:40:14,509
It's not working.

1788
01:40:15,176 --> 01:40:17,262
So what does that mean?
Did she block you?

1789
01:40:19,806 --> 01:40:21,641
Did something happen to her?

1790
01:40:25,895 --> 01:40:27,313
Did you pay the phone?

1791
01:40:32,944 --> 01:40:34,654
So she did? She blocked us?

1792
01:40:42,620 --> 01:40:46,124
How did she meet Vernon?
Did you introduce her?

1793
01:40:46,207 --> 01:40:48,126
All I did was I-I

1794
01:40:48,209 --> 01:40:51,046
encouraged her to
do her own research.

1795
01:40:51,129 --> 01:40:54,758
And she was mad at you, so
I took her to Albuquerque

1796
01:40:54,841 --> 01:40:56,843
because he was there to do
that talk. That lecture.

1797
01:40:56,926 --> 01:40:59,137
I didn't like some of the
things he was saying, but...

1798
01:41:00,346 --> 01:41:03,934
I was so relieved that
she was getting involved,

1799
01:41:04,017 --> 01:41:06,935
and I thought her head was
coming out of the sand and...

1800
01:41:53,191 --> 01:41:55,902
I actually ain't leaving
until something is done.

1801
01:41:55,985 --> 01:41:57,403
Yeah. Um...

1802
01:41:57,946 --> 01:42:01,532
Sheriff. The kid says
he'll only talk to you.

1803
01:42:02,992 --> 01:42:04,745
He's been avoiding eye contact
like he's on something.

1804
01:42:04,828 --> 01:42:06,329
I saw him at the riots.

1805
01:42:14,170 --> 01:42:15,839
The next morning,

1806
01:42:15,922 --> 01:42:17,716
after I sent the picture to,

1807
01:42:17,799 --> 01:42:19,342
uh, him, out there...

1808
01:42:19,676 --> 01:42:21,010
To... To Michael.

1809
01:42:21,719 --> 01:42:23,179
-Yeah, Michael.
-Okay.

1810
01:42:24,806 --> 01:42:25,891
The next morning,

1811
01:42:25,974 --> 01:42:28,601
I-I went to Eric's to see if...

1812
01:42:29,435 --> 01:42:30,728
You know, if...

1813
01:42:31,604 --> 01:42:33,190
See if that girl
was still there,

1814
01:42:33,273 --> 01:42:35,191
if she slept over or whatever.

1815
01:42:35,900 --> 01:42:36,651
Sarah.

1816
01:42:36,734 --> 01:42:37,734
Yeah.

1817
01:42:38,236 --> 01:42:39,154
Uh,

1818
01:42:39,237 --> 01:42:41,990
but that's when I
saw police cars.

1819
01:42:42,782 --> 01:42:43,825
Okay.

1820
01:42:43,908 --> 01:42:44,908
Um...

1821
01:42:45,535 --> 01:42:46,661
Uh...

1822
01:42:46,744 --> 01:42:50,123
Yeah, you just sit...
sit tight, okay?

1823
01:42:50,206 --> 01:42:53,835
And, uh...

1824
01:42:59,465 --> 01:43:02,176
Hey, Guy, get in there. I
got to go grab my phone.

1825
01:43:09,183 --> 01:43:11,102
Hey! You need any help?

1826
01:43:13,855 --> 01:43:15,106
Do you know... Do
you know Michael?

1827
01:43:15,189 --> 01:43:16,441
No, no, no.

1828
01:43:16,858 --> 01:43:19,986
I did see him talking to
Sarah at a protest, and...

1829
01:43:20,945 --> 01:43:22,155
I mean, he...

1830
01:43:22,238 --> 01:43:24,908
He looked like he
could kill somebody.

1831
01:43:25,450 --> 01:43:26,618
Like he...

1832
01:43:26,701 --> 01:43:27,953
But obviously I didn't
actually think that.

1833
01:43:28,036 --> 01:43:29,412
We gotta get to his
place, like, now.

1834
01:43:29,495 --> 01:43:30,956
Before he can flush anything.

1835
01:43:31,039 --> 01:43:32,332
Look, can I leave?

1836
01:43:32,415 --> 01:43:33,792
Can you not do
anything with me here?

1837
01:43:33,875 --> 01:43:35,376
You can step outside, Brian.

1838
01:43:46,721 --> 01:43:48,014
He's ambitious.

1839
01:43:48,097 --> 01:43:50,183
He's been cozying up to you,
you know. Getting real close.

1840
01:43:50,266 --> 01:43:52,435
Maybe he kills the mayor,

1841
01:43:52,518 --> 01:43:54,646
then you win, and you
help him get sheriff.

1842
01:43:54,729 --> 01:43:55,981
I don't know.

1843
01:43:56,064 --> 01:43:58,733
Uh... Maybe he's been
spying this whole time.

1844
01:43:59,108 --> 01:44:00,527
What whole time?

1845
01:44:00,610 --> 01:44:02,320
I mean, his dad was here first.

1846
01:44:02,904 --> 01:44:04,322
Yeah, exactly.

1847
01:44:05,281 --> 01:44:08,034
I'm not trying to
make this about...

1848
01:44:08,451 --> 01:44:11,162
I didn't even see the
race with Michael,

1849
01:44:11,245 --> 01:44:13,540
until all this Blacks
Lives Matter stuff.

1850
01:44:13,623 --> 01:44:16,960
But now here it is. Okay?
So... So who is he now?

1851
01:44:17,043 --> 01:44:19,837
Is he more of an
officer or more...?

1852
01:44:22,590 --> 01:44:24,258
But we need evidence.

1853
01:44:24,801 --> 01:44:27,762
I mean, that's just motive.
I mean, I have motive.

1854
01:44:28,513 --> 01:44:30,682
You know, and Eric wasn't
white, he's Hispanic.

1855
01:44:30,765 --> 01:44:33,643
Yeah. Blacks hate
Hispanics, too.

1856
01:44:34,102 --> 01:44:36,354
All these other colors
are just fake minorities

1857
01:44:36,437 --> 01:44:37,689
stealing their coupons away.

1858
01:44:37,772 --> 01:44:39,857
They hate them more
than they hate whites.

1859
01:44:41,901 --> 01:44:42,902
Okay, Mike.

1860
01:44:44,362 --> 01:44:47,490
Just... There were
some allegations made.

1861
01:44:47,573 --> 01:44:50,702
And, uh, we need to specifically
look at your Instagram.

1862
01:44:50,785 --> 01:44:52,829
Just so we can clear you. Okay?

1863
01:44:52,912 --> 01:44:54,706
Allegations like... like what?

1864
01:44:54,789 --> 01:44:56,041
We just need to take a look

1865
01:44:56,124 --> 01:44:59,002
at your Instagram
messages, specifically.

1866
01:44:59,085 --> 01:45:01,963
And, uh, that's it.
We'll be done with this.

1867
01:45:05,717 --> 01:45:08,511
It's okay. All right, come on.

1868
01:45:14,934 --> 01:45:15,727
So...

1869
01:45:15,810 --> 01:45:16,770
Wait, wait, wait.

1870
01:45:16,853 --> 01:45:18,897
I'm just documenting that

1871
01:45:18,980 --> 01:45:21,024
this message has been
opened, as you can see.

1872
01:45:21,107 --> 01:45:23,234
Okay. And, uh,

1873
01:45:23,317 --> 01:45:25,987
hmm...

1874
01:45:32,118 --> 01:45:33,118
What?

1875
01:45:33,327 --> 01:45:35,204
Yeah. I know. Eric
Garcia, right?

1876
01:45:35,621 --> 01:45:38,458
Mikey, well, it's
Eric Garcia and...

1877
01:45:39,000 --> 01:45:42,045
with this young lady that
you have a connection to...

1878
01:45:42,128 --> 01:45:43,338
Connection? Hardly a connection.

1879
01:45:43,421 --> 01:45:44,547
I hardly know her.

1880
01:45:46,215 --> 01:45:47,550
Does that say something?

1881
01:45:49,218 --> 01:45:51,930
I mean, it is the day before
he got fucking shot, Mike.

1882
01:45:52,013 --> 01:45:53,723
And he's taking pictures
with your little girlfriend.

1883
01:45:53,806 --> 01:45:55,266
Tooley, I swear to God, man.

1884
01:45:55,349 --> 01:45:56,101
Okay.

1885
01:45:56,184 --> 01:45:57,184
Hey.

1886
01:45:58,728 --> 01:46:01,647
Mike, how old's this girl?

1887
01:46:02,482 --> 01:46:04,442
I don't know. Like 18.

1888
01:46:04,525 --> 01:46:06,528
Like 18? So not 18?

1889
01:46:06,611 --> 01:46:09,489
She's definitely 18. Is
that what the allegation is?

1890
01:46:09,572 --> 01:46:10,615
Mikey...

1891
01:46:10,698 --> 01:46:12,701
Sheriff, my point is,
I hardly know her.

1892
01:46:12,784 --> 01:46:14,160
And we haven't done anything.

1893
01:46:14,243 --> 01:46:15,620
All right, look, it
didn't bother you

1894
01:46:15,703 --> 01:46:16,746
when you got this photo?

1895
01:46:16,829 --> 01:46:18,415
It doesn't bother you
to see her like that?

1896
01:46:18,498 --> 01:46:20,834
No. I mean, the only
reason that bothers me

1897
01:46:20,917 --> 01:46:22,836
is because someone was
trying to bother me.

1898
01:46:22,919 --> 01:46:24,671
But then I completely
forgot about it, Sheriff.

1899
01:46:24,754 --> 01:46:25,754
Sheriff?

1900
01:46:25,922 --> 01:46:27,048
Yeah.

1901
01:46:27,131 --> 01:46:29,134
Could you, uh, step
outside, please?

1902
01:46:29,217 --> 01:46:31,553
Can I step inside, please?

1903
01:46:31,636 --> 01:46:33,137
We got a 10-80 in the back seat.

1904
01:46:41,062 --> 01:46:44,232
Now, why wasn't this
checked in immediately?

1905
01:46:44,690 --> 01:46:46,192
Checked in?

1906
01:46:46,275 --> 01:46:48,319
I would've checked it in
by the end of the day.

1907
01:46:49,487 --> 01:46:51,698
Sheriff, you knew I had
the gun out for practice.

1908
01:46:51,781 --> 01:46:52,824
You're the one that
told me to practice.

1909
01:46:52,907 --> 01:46:54,242
It's just a coincidence, right?

1910
01:46:54,325 --> 01:46:56,405
That it's just the same
caliber as the murder weapon?

1911
01:46:56,786 --> 01:46:58,288
Sh... Sheriff, you can
give this to ballistics,

1912
01:46:58,371 --> 01:47:00,873
and you will see it's
not the same gun. Simple.

1913
01:47:03,292 --> 01:47:05,003
Okay, we got to search the unit.

1914
01:47:05,086 --> 01:47:06,421
I mean, what for? We
already established

1915
01:47:06,504 --> 01:47:07,422
the gun's in the
back of the car.

1916
01:47:07,505 --> 01:47:08,673
You know what for.

1917
01:47:08,756 --> 01:47:10,383
-Okay? Is that all right?
-What?

1918
01:47:10,466 --> 01:47:11,634
You don't need my permission
to search my unit.

1919
01:47:11,717 --> 01:47:12,844
I know I don't need
your permission.

1920
01:47:12,927 --> 01:47:14,095
I'm just asking you.

1921
01:47:14,178 --> 01:47:16,181
And I got nothing to
hide, so we can proceed.

1922
01:47:16,264 --> 01:47:17,307
Good, good. Come on.

1923
01:47:17,390 --> 01:47:18,767
Let's give him a
little bit of space.

1924
01:47:18,850 --> 01:47:19,809
Who? Excuse me.

1925
01:47:19,892 --> 01:47:21,686
I don't give my
permission to him.

1926
01:47:21,769 --> 01:47:22,687
Hell fucking no.

1927
01:47:22,770 --> 01:47:23,730
I don't care if you
give him permission.

1928
01:47:23,813 --> 01:47:24,522
No, but I don't trust him.

1929
01:47:24,605 --> 01:47:26,065
I don't care if you trust him.

1930
01:47:27,108 --> 01:47:28,193
Okay, fine, why
don't we just get

1931
01:47:28,276 --> 01:47:29,402
our Pueblo friend to do it?

1932
01:47:29,485 --> 01:47:30,904
Since you're just... everywhere!

1933
01:47:30,987 --> 01:47:33,698
You know, third
party, no conflict.

1934
01:47:34,031 --> 01:47:35,031
Okay?

1935
01:47:37,201 --> 01:47:38,619
-Fine.
-Yeah?

1936
01:47:39,120 --> 01:47:40,120
Yeah.

1937
01:47:40,454 --> 01:47:41,747
Hey, you have gloves?

1938
01:47:59,974 --> 01:48:01,058
Got a bag.

1939
01:48:16,991 --> 01:48:17,991
Got something.

1940
01:48:20,620 --> 01:48:23,414
What... What's that?
What the fuck is that?

1941
01:48:23,831 --> 01:48:25,291
I've never seen that before.

1942
01:48:25,374 --> 01:48:27,085
"To a marvelous mayor."

1943
01:48:27,168 --> 01:48:28,920
-It says that?
-This is his fucking watch.

1944
01:48:29,003 --> 01:48:29,921
-Sheriff.
-Excuse me.

1945
01:48:30,004 --> 01:48:30,922
What the fuck?

1946
01:48:31,005 --> 01:48:32,382
That wasn't there...
What do you mean?

1947
01:48:32,465 --> 01:48:33,800
Do I have permission
to arrest him?

1948
01:48:33,883 --> 01:48:35,635
-Can you believe...?
-Hands up, Mike.

1949
01:48:35,718 --> 01:48:37,595
-This doesn't even feel real.
-Come on, Mike. Hands up.

1950
01:48:37,678 --> 01:48:39,430
-Don't go near your weapon.
-Hands up for what?

1951
01:48:39,513 --> 01:48:40,974
-Okay.
-Sheriff, here's his weapon.

1952
01:48:41,057 --> 01:48:42,225
He's been disarmed.

1953
01:48:42,308 --> 01:48:43,226
What is going on
right now? I can't...

1954
01:48:43,309 --> 01:48:45,854
I've never seen
that watch before.

1955
01:48:45,937 --> 01:48:47,105
-Hands, Mike!
-It's impossible.

1956
01:48:47,188 --> 01:48:49,107
Hey, easy! Take it easy!

1957
01:48:49,190 --> 01:48:51,816
All right, step inside
the cell please, Sergeant.

1958
01:48:57,865 --> 01:48:59,909
Hey, Guy. Put this into
evidence and send the gun

1959
01:48:59,992 --> 01:49:02,287
-out to the lab, okay?
-Hey, Sheriff.

1960
01:49:02,370 --> 01:49:03,621
Sheriff, if I'm
really being arrested,

1961
01:49:03,704 --> 01:49:05,331
I need to make my
phone call. Please.

1962
01:49:06,540 --> 01:49:07,540
All right.

1963
01:49:21,514 --> 01:49:24,267
Sheriff, please. Please
don't do this to me. I'm...

1964
01:49:24,725 --> 01:49:25,851
Hey.

1965
01:49:27,853 --> 01:49:29,230
I haven't done anything wrong.

1966
01:49:45,413 --> 01:49:49,208
Uncle Jamie, uh,
it's me, Michael.

1967
01:49:51,377 --> 01:49:53,004
I'm in the hol... holding cell

1968
01:49:53,087 --> 01:49:54,588
at the Sheriff's
Office in Eddington.

1969
01:49:58,467 --> 01:50:03,389
I-I've just been arrested,
and I'm being set up.

1970
01:50:06,392 --> 01:50:07,727
They're planting shit on me,

1971
01:50:07,810 --> 01:50:09,562
and they're saying
that I killed...

1972
01:50:09,645 --> 01:50:14,107
...I killed the mayor and... and
his son, and... and I didn't.

1973
01:50:16,861 --> 01:50:18,988
I'm gonna need some help.

1974
01:50:19,739 --> 01:50:21,365
I'm gonna need a lawyer...

1975
01:50:29,540 --> 01:50:31,125
I love you and Aunt Kyra.

1976
01:51:04,116 --> 01:51:05,743
The meaning of a
candlelight vigil

1977
01:51:05,826 --> 01:51:07,412
is different for everyone.

1978
01:51:07,495 --> 01:51:09,330
Candles get lit one by one.

1979
01:51:09,413 --> 01:51:11,958
It's a symbol for spreading
a message of support

1980
01:51:12,041 --> 01:51:14,127
from one person to another.

1981
01:51:14,210 --> 01:51:15,586
As darkness surrounds us,

1982
01:51:15,669 --> 01:51:18,089
a good man and a
bright young boy

1983
01:51:18,172 --> 01:51:20,591
struck down before they
could do their work

1984
01:51:21,217 --> 01:51:23,511
towards real progress
in this town.

1985
01:51:24,595 --> 01:51:26,431
Progress towards a
better, more equitable,

1986
01:51:26,514 --> 01:51:28,099
more connected future.

1987
01:51:28,891 --> 01:51:30,101
Work that will still be done,

1988
01:51:30,184 --> 01:51:31,769
and we'll see to it
that it is done...

1989
01:51:31,852 --> 01:51:33,729
in their memory and their honor.

1990
01:52:42,965 --> 01:52:45,551
Hello? Help!

1991
01:52:47,636 --> 01:52:48,971
Hello?

1992
01:52:52,308 --> 01:52:55,685
Pueblo Police.

1993
01:53:04,445 --> 01:53:05,905
My daughter went
off with a man...

1994
01:53:05,988 --> 01:53:07,073
-I'm sorry.
-...and I think that they

1995
01:53:07,156 --> 01:53:09,158
or she, or he were just here

1996
01:53:09,241 --> 01:53:10,410
because when I came back,

1997
01:53:10,493 --> 01:53:11,911
-all her stuff was gone...
-Ma'am.

1998
01:53:11,994 --> 01:53:13,663
...all her artwork and
the car and everything.

1999
01:53:13,746 --> 01:53:16,040
I'm just here to ask you if
there's a gun in the house.

2000
01:53:16,123 --> 01:53:17,417
-Sheriff.
-They took everything.

2001
01:53:17,500 --> 01:53:18,918
Sheriff, are you there, Sheriff?

2002
01:53:19,001 --> 01:53:20,420
Yeah, but have you seen
this AR in the house?

2003
01:53:20,503 --> 01:53:22,046
I have no idea.

2004
01:53:22,129 --> 01:53:23,756
Do you think he could
have done the murders?

2005
01:53:23,839 --> 01:53:26,257
His name is Vernon Peak.

2006
01:53:28,636 --> 01:53:29,887
Yeah?

2007
01:53:29,970 --> 01:53:31,690
Sheriff, we got a
dumpster fire in the back.

2008
01:53:32,473 --> 01:53:34,350
He was a person of color

2009
01:53:34,433 --> 01:53:37,269
who beat the odds to
become a person of power.

2010
01:53:38,479 --> 01:53:41,941
And they got killed
by that same system.

2011
01:53:42,900 --> 01:53:44,944
Even the killer's
a victim of it.

2012
01:53:45,486 --> 01:53:47,071
And I'm a part of it.

2013
01:53:47,488 --> 01:53:49,322
I'm just another
privileged white kid...

2014
01:53:50,449 --> 01:53:53,244
...and my job is to
sit down and listen,

2015
01:53:53,327 --> 01:53:55,455
which is what I plan to do
after making this speech,

2016
01:53:55,538 --> 01:53:58,916
which I have no right to make!

2017
01:54:00,334 --> 01:54:03,461
This vigil is happening
on stolen ground!

2018
01:54:17,351 --> 01:54:21,063
I was putting the stupid
watch and gun into evidence.

2019
01:54:21,146 --> 01:54:23,190
Oh, the watch and
gun are stupid?

2020
01:54:24,358 --> 01:54:25,776
I swear on God, Sheriff.

2021
01:54:25,859 --> 01:54:27,612
I wasn't gone for
more than one minute.

2022
01:54:27,695 --> 01:54:29,572
You weren't supposed
to be gone at all!

2023
01:54:33,450 --> 01:54:35,244
Shit. Where the fuck is
the fire extinguisher?

2024
01:54:35,327 --> 01:54:37,079
I already used it.
It wasn't enough.

2025
01:54:37,997 --> 01:54:38,998
-I know. I know...
-What?

2026
01:54:39,081 --> 01:54:40,291
I know, I know, I know.
-What?

2027
01:54:40,374 --> 01:54:41,501
Th... This is the new thing.

2028
01:54:41,584 --> 01:54:43,503
This happened
after I called you.

2029
01:54:43,586 --> 01:54:45,921
What the fuck am I looking at?

2030
01:54:53,429 --> 01:54:54,889
Whose fucking key is this?

2031
01:54:54,972 --> 01:54:56,265
-This your key?
-I don't know. No!

2032
01:54:56,348 --> 01:54:58,351
-No? Then why did you open it?
-No!

2033
01:54:58,434 --> 01:54:59,477
What you're seeing
is what I saw.

2034
01:54:59,560 --> 01:55:01,020
What do you mean?
What am I seeing?

2035
01:55:01,103 --> 01:55:01,979
I don't even know what
the fuck I'm seeing!

2036
01:55:02,062 --> 01:55:02,980
You are how I was.

2037
01:55:03,063 --> 01:55:04,232
You're not making
any fucking sense!

2038
01:55:04,315 --> 01:55:05,942
Somebody had to
let him out, right?

2039
01:55:06,025 --> 01:55:07,609
You take Zia, I'll take Main!

2040
01:57:07,688 --> 01:57:08,897
Hands, Mike!

2041
01:57:09,398 --> 01:57:11,150
Put your hands behind your head.

2042
01:57:11,233 --> 01:57:12,943
Put your hands behind
your head, Mike.

2043
01:57:13,652 --> 01:57:15,529
Turn around and walk
backwards towards me.

2044
01:57:17,239 --> 01:57:19,074
Down on the ground, Mike! Down!

2045
01:57:19,491 --> 01:57:21,035
Now! Get down on the ground!

2046
01:57:21,118 --> 01:57:22,995
What the fuck are
you doing, Mike?

2047
01:57:23,078 --> 01:57:25,122
Sheriff, he won't listen to me.

2048
01:57:25,205 --> 01:57:27,624
He's just standing there. I
don't know what's going on.

2049
01:57:28,041 --> 01:57:29,710
Mike, what the fuck, man?

2050
01:57:30,544 --> 01:57:31,544
Mike.

2051
01:57:32,087 --> 01:57:34,046
The whole place smells like gas.

2052
01:57:36,091 --> 01:57:39,344
What the fuck?
Mike, please, man!

2053
01:57:39,928 --> 01:57:41,680
What is this, Mike?

2054
01:57:43,056 --> 01:57:45,893
Mike! Put your hands
behind your head!

2055
01:57:45,976 --> 01:57:47,436
I can't. I can't.

2056
01:57:47,519 --> 01:57:50,147
What are you saying?

2057
01:57:50,230 --> 01:57:52,650
What the fuck is going on here?

2058
01:57:52,733 --> 01:57:54,276
Put your hands behind
your fucking head, Mike.

2059
01:57:54,359 --> 01:57:56,320
They said if I talk or move,

2060
01:57:56,403 --> 01:57:57,697
they're gonna shoot me.

2061
01:57:57,780 --> 01:57:59,198
I don't...

2062
01:57:59,281 --> 01:58:01,241
What do we do?
Should we advance?

2063
01:58:01,700 --> 01:58:03,284
Do we fall back?
Can we fall back?

2064
01:58:04,495 --> 01:58:05,955
This feels really
not good, Sheriff.

2065
01:58:06,038 --> 01:58:08,748
I've got cover! Go, hands on!

2066
01:58:10,793 --> 01:58:13,962
No. No, no, no! No. Stop!

2067
02:03:05,045 --> 02:03:06,379
Freeze!

2068
02:03:07,255 --> 02:03:10,342
Put the bag down.

2069
02:03:19,226 --> 02:03:20,268
Rabbit?

2070
02:03:33,949 --> 02:03:35,534
I knew you'd come back.

2071
02:03:39,871 --> 02:03:42,207
It's because of what
I did, isn't it?

2072
02:03:43,917 --> 02:03:46,253
I'm being called upon, aren't I?

2073
02:03:47,254 --> 02:03:48,713
Am I being called upon?

2074
02:03:51,716 --> 02:03:54,219
They're-They're coming after me.

2075
02:04:01,393 --> 02:04:03,645
Is what I'm supposed to do...

2076
02:04:03,728 --> 02:04:06,023
Is this... Am I supposed to...

2077
02:04:06,106 --> 02:04:08,567
Do you want me to finish this?

2078
02:04:08,650 --> 02:04:09,650
So...

2079
02:04:12,487 --> 02:04:15,699
it was Vernon. And Lou.

2080
02:04:17,951 --> 02:04:20,787
I need to leave.
I cannot be here.

2081
02:04:23,248 --> 02:04:25,083
What if they're back for us?

2082
02:04:26,042 --> 02:04:29,963
If they did kill Ted... What
if they're back to kill me?

2083
02:04:31,798 --> 02:04:33,383
I killed Ted.

2084
02:04:34,509 --> 02:04:35,552
I did it.

2085
02:04:39,639 --> 02:04:41,933
Vernon... Vernon is a fake.

2086
02:04:42,767 --> 02:04:44,853
He was a false temptation,

2087
02:04:44,936 --> 02:04:49,441
and she let herself get
tricked, and she went with him.

2088
02:04:51,193 --> 02:04:54,946
I'm the one that's taken action.

2089
02:04:55,530 --> 02:04:59,827
All I had to do was start it.
And now I have to finish it.

2090
02:04:59,910 --> 02:05:03,038
We are in the center
of it right now.

2091
02:05:03,121 --> 02:05:04,914
We are in history.

2092
02:05:18,053 --> 02:05:19,136
See?

2093
02:05:33,985 --> 02:05:35,946
Get down!

2094
02:05:37,697 --> 02:05:38,866
My back!

2095
02:05:38,949 --> 02:05:41,493
No! Is it them? It's them!

2096
02:05:41,576 --> 02:05:43,370
Is it them?

2097
02:05:43,453 --> 02:05:45,747
It's Vernon, they're
trying to kill me!

2098
02:10:11,804 --> 02:10:12,805
Freeze!

2099
02:13:43,891 --> 02:13:45,559
I'm going to shoot!
I'm going to shoot!

2100
02:14:07,373 --> 02:14:09,709
Oh, my God. Oh, my God, Sheriff.

2101
02:14:10,251 --> 02:14:12,504
Oh, my God, are
you okay? Sheriff?

2102
02:14:12,587 --> 02:14:14,422
Sheriff, I saved you.

2103
02:14:14,505 --> 02:14:15,715
I saved you.

2104
02:14:18,468 --> 02:14:21,763
Oh. Oh.

2105
02:14:39,781 --> 02:14:42,116
-Jesus.
-This guy is barely...

2106
02:14:45,953 --> 02:14:47,288
105. Take him to the tent.

2107
02:14:47,371 --> 02:14:48,331
Look at this guy.

2108
02:14:48,414 --> 02:14:49,499
There's no treating
this in the tent.

2109
02:14:49,582 --> 02:14:50,917
105, he goes to the hot zone.

2110
02:14:51,000 --> 02:14:51,960
Come on.

2111
02:14:52,043 --> 02:14:53,503
This one's done anyways.

2112
02:14:54,879 --> 02:14:56,047
Crazy.

2113
02:14:56,130 --> 02:14:57,673
105. What do you
want me to say, man?

2114
02:15:03,137 --> 02:15:06,683
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Oh, my God, Sheriff.

2115
02:15:06,766 --> 02:15:09,519
Oh, my God, are
you okay? Sheriff?

2116
02:15:09,602 --> 02:15:11,770
Sheriff, I saved
you. I saved you.

Do you think he's actually

I'll show you the rest later,
so I don't get us pulled over.

2145
02:16:29,849 --> 02:16:31,434
And when they broadcast
the 18 gigahertz

2146
02:16:31,517 --> 02:16:32,936
signal from the 5G system

2147
02:16:33,019 --> 02:16:34,354
employed all across the world

2148
02:16:34,437 --> 02:16:36,314
for one minute three
different times as a pulse,

2149
02:16:36,397 --> 02:16:38,149
it'll cause those
lipid nanoparticles

2150
02:16:38,232 --> 02:16:39,484
that are baked into the shots

2151
02:16:39,567 --> 02:16:42,862
to swell and release
those pathogenic contents.

2152
02:16:43,446 --> 02:16:45,281
But today is about
a major step forward

2153
02:16:45,364 --> 02:16:47,700
in the tech industry
here in New Mexico.

2154
02:16:47,783 --> 02:16:49,077
And my son-in-law,

2155
02:16:49,160 --> 02:16:51,120
the Mayor of
Eddington, Mayor Cross,

2156
02:16:51,203 --> 02:16:53,748
wants to take this opportunity

2157
02:16:53,831 --> 02:16:58,211
to give a warm thanks
to Solidgoldmagikarp

2158
02:16:58,294 --> 02:16:59,921
for choosing as their home

2159
02:17:00,004 --> 02:17:03,341
Sevilla County and
Santa Lupe Pueblo,

2160
02:17:03,424 --> 02:17:07,844
on whose shared land this
data center now resides.

2161
02:17:11,098 --> 02:17:13,852
We are now, both and together,

2162
02:17:13,935 --> 02:17:17,605
one of the privileged places
where the future is being built.

2163
02:17:17,688 --> 02:17:19,148
And at this moment,

2164
02:17:19,231 --> 02:17:20,859
when unheard of, wicked things

2165
02:17:20,942 --> 02:17:23,152
are being perpetrated
by our government...

2166
02:17:23,235 --> 02:17:24,904
World Economic Forum,

2167
02:17:24,987 --> 02:17:28,867
population control through
disease and vaccine,

2168
02:17:28,950 --> 02:17:30,410
with the people that
created the virus

2169
02:17:30,493 --> 02:17:32,287
now giving us the cure...

2170
02:17:32,370 --> 02:17:34,538
All of us Useless Eaters.

2171
02:17:35,289 --> 02:17:36,916
The opportunity at
this dark moment

2172
02:17:36,999 --> 02:17:40,670
to sculpt a brighter future
is something to be cherished.

2173
02:17:40,753 --> 02:17:42,130
And earned.

2174
02:17:42,213 --> 02:17:46,885
We are now home to an advanced
supercomputing infrastructure

2175
02:17:46,968 --> 02:17:49,012
powering the future
of a technology

2176
02:17:49,095 --> 02:17:51,931
that will indeed
change everything

2177
02:17:52,014 --> 02:17:55,018
and solve problems we've
never been able to solve

2178
02:17:55,101 --> 02:17:58,479
and all the while using the
least amount of energy and water

2179
02:17:58,562 --> 02:18:00,565
as any data complex
in the southwest!

2180
02:18:00,648 --> 02:18:02,233
Sir. Sir, pardon me, sir.

2181
02:18:02,316 --> 02:18:03,902
You do not have
permission to film here.

2182
02:18:03,985 --> 02:18:05,361
This is a private event.

2183
02:18:05,444 --> 02:18:07,572
And that's because of
what we're doing in solar.

2184
02:18:07,655 --> 02:18:09,324
And what the
Pueblo's doing, too!

2185
02:18:09,407 --> 02:18:11,492
They got their new
wind farm building up,

2186
02:18:11,575 --> 02:18:17,040
taking part in New Mexico's
370-billion-dollar investment

2187
02:18:17,123 --> 02:18:18,750
in renewable energy.

2188
02:18:18,833 --> 02:18:24,213
Pushing advancements in wind,
in solar, in geothermal,

2189
02:18:24,296 --> 02:18:28,174
and soon the Governor's hoping
to announce hydrogen, too!

2190
02:18:45,401 --> 02:18:47,779
Plane hits a building,
two buildings,

2191
02:18:47,862 --> 02:18:49,572
they don't fall that way.

2192
02:18:49,655 --> 02:18:51,449
That's how they go with
controlled demolitions.

2193
02:18:51,532 --> 02:18:53,366
You detonate the bottom.

2194
02:19:00,041 --> 02:19:02,835
Why am I just noticing
that you need a haircut?

2195
02:19:09,175 --> 02:19:10,551
Did you have a good day?

2196
02:19:10,634 --> 02:19:13,720
I did. I may have had a
little too much to drink.

2197
02:19:15,306 --> 02:19:18,935
There's never been a
licensed MRNA vaccine

2198
02:19:19,018 --> 02:19:22,480
and that ain't because there
haven't been clinical trials.

2199
02:19:22,563 --> 02:19:25,441
It's because there were
significant adverse effects

2200
02:19:25,524 --> 02:19:27,819
on the animals
they tested it on.

2201
02:19:27,902 --> 02:19:29,445
And the deepfake of Uncle Joe

2202
02:19:29,528 --> 02:19:31,614
getting his jab is
no contradiction.

2203
02:19:31,697 --> 02:19:33,157
The man in the video had arms

2204
02:19:33,240 --> 02:19:34,784
hairier than any ape.

2205
02:19:34,867 --> 02:19:36,536
I'm surprised they didn't use

2206
02:19:36,619 --> 02:19:39,496
their AI Picasso
to fix those arms.

2207
02:19:43,709 --> 02:19:44,794
I'm sorry.

2208
02:19:45,795 --> 02:19:46,795
I'm sorry.

2209
02:19:53,761 --> 02:19:56,013
I went a little too
far with the blush.

2210
02:20:31,674 --> 02:20:34,343
They have deprived
you of your identity.

2211
02:20:34,426 --> 02:20:36,888
And that deprivation
and that slavery

2212
02:20:36,971 --> 02:20:39,557
keeps you from being an
agent of actual change,

2213
02:20:39,640 --> 02:20:42,101
and it keeps them
right where they are.

2214
02:20:42,184 --> 02:20:43,269
Well, guess what?

2215
02:20:43,894 --> 02:20:45,354
You are not alone.

2216
02:20:46,564 --> 02:20:51,027
Guess what? Your pain
is not a coincidence.

2217
02:20:51,110 --> 02:20:53,071
You are not a coincidence.

2218
02:20:53,154 --> 02:20:55,406
We are not a coincidence!

2219
02:20:56,699 --> 02:20:58,117
Will you fight?

2220
02:20:59,743 --> 02:21:00,828
I will!

2221
02:21:01,787 --> 02:21:03,748
I'll do it for me as a child,

2222
02:21:03,831 --> 02:21:06,000
and I'll do it for
my future children,

2223
02:21:06,083 --> 02:21:07,710
and I will do it
for your children

2224
02:21:07,793 --> 02:21:09,295
and your future children.

2225
02:21:09,378 --> 02:21:11,380
And I will do it for
their physical bodies

2226
02:21:11,463 --> 02:21:13,549
and I will do it for
their digital bodies.

2227
02:21:13,632 --> 02:21:14,926
And I will win

2228
02:21:15,009 --> 02:21:17,762
because I have fortified
myself in Christ,

2229
02:21:17,845 --> 02:21:20,348
and I'm talking about the
Lord Christ, Jesus God!

2230
02:21:20,431 --> 02:21:22,974
And with the Holy
Spirit as our shield...

2231
02:22:35,214 --> 02:22:36,382
