1
00:02:44,081 --> 00:02:45,415
<i>Good morning, sweetheart.</i>

2
00:02:45,499 --> 00:02:48,544
<i>I had to leave super early this
morning to drop off some saddles.</i>

3
00:02:48,627 --> 00:02:50,003
<i>I hope I didn't wake you.</i>

4
00:02:50,504 --> 00:02:53,298
<i>Could you take the horses
out if it stopped raining?</i>

5
00:02:53,882 --> 00:02:55,592
<i>I'll be back home
in about an hour.</i>

6
00:02:56,844 --> 00:02:58,679
Come on. Let's go.

7
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:12,067
<i>I was thinking, let's stay
home this weekend, huh?</i>

8
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:14,528
<i>Catch up on that to-do
list we keep putting off?</i>

9
00:03:14,611 --> 00:03:16,691
<i>I promise I'll fix that
crack in the bedroom ceiling.</i>

10
00:03:37,968 --> 00:03:42,097
<i>Hey, I just wanted to say
sorry about last night.</i>

11
00:03:42,181 --> 00:03:44,391
<i>I was just drunk and
being insensitive.</i>

12
00:03:44,474 --> 00:03:46,351
<i>Anyway, I'm back
home in half an hour</i>

13
00:03:46,435 --> 00:03:49,688
<i>and I'm going to shower you with
kisses until you forgive me.</i>

14
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:52,191
Kate. I'm sorry.

15
00:03:52,274 --> 00:03:54,443
-I didn't mean to scare you.
-No. Sorry.

16
00:03:54,526 --> 00:03:55,903
Let me just take out my...

17
00:03:57,988 --> 00:03:59,323
What's the verdict?

18
00:03:59,406 --> 00:04:01,408
You wanna come and
have a look with me?

19
00:04:01,491 --> 00:04:02,784
I don't know. Do I?

20
00:04:05,412 --> 00:04:06,872
Okay. Come on, Coop.

21
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:12,085
You see the dips? Those rafters
could collapse any day now.

22
00:04:12,169 --> 00:04:13,838
Then you've got a real
mess on your hands.

23
00:04:13,921 --> 00:04:15,088
How much to replace it?

24
00:04:15,172 --> 00:04:19,176
Well, if you stick with the shingles,
you're looking at around $9,000.

25
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:25,098
Okay, let me think on it
and I'll get back to you.

26
00:04:25,182 --> 00:04:26,266
No rush.

27
00:04:52,167 --> 00:04:53,961
-Morning, Kate.
-Hi.

28
00:04:54,628 --> 00:04:57,172
Hannah, why are you not dressed?

29
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:00,551
Could you be a little
polite and say hi to Kate?

30
00:05:00,634 --> 00:05:01,510
Hi, Kate.

31
00:05:01,593 --> 00:05:02,636
Hi, sweetheart.

32
00:05:02,719 --> 00:05:04,930
Richard, honey,
Kate's here again.

33
00:05:05,597 --> 00:05:07,015
I'm back in my office.

34
00:05:07,099 --> 00:05:08,726
Sorry, I gotta get
this little one ready.

35
00:05:08,809 --> 00:05:11,228
-Do you wanna just go on in?
-Yeah, of course. Thank you.

36
00:05:11,812 --> 00:05:13,438
Come on, sweetie.
We got to hustle.

37
00:05:13,522 --> 00:05:15,732
I'm coming, I'm
coming. Geez, Mom.

38
00:05:20,279 --> 00:05:21,780
-Good morning.
-Hey.

39
00:05:22,406 --> 00:05:23,407
Come in.

40
00:05:24,908 --> 00:05:26,660
I'm trying to find a brief.

41
00:05:26,743 --> 00:05:29,872
I hired a new assistant,
and it's not working out.

42
00:05:29,955 --> 00:05:31,623
I don't know where
the hell anything is.

43
00:05:32,958 --> 00:05:34,418
Please, sit.

44
00:05:34,501 --> 00:05:35,502
Thanks.

45
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:37,880
Yeah, this is good.

46
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:46,847
So, your message said you needed
to discuss the roof. Is that right?

47
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:48,307
Yeah...

48
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:53,770
Randy came out to take a look and
unfortunately, we need a new one.

49
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:57,357
-Well, not surprised.
-I know. I know.

50
00:05:57,441 --> 00:05:59,484
I thought that we had two years,

51
00:05:59,568 --> 00:06:00,820
-you know, at least.
-How much?

52
00:06:00,903 --> 00:06:02,237
How much?

53
00:06:05,157 --> 00:06:06,157
9,000.

54
00:06:06,783 --> 00:06:08,911
9,000. This is turning
into a bad joke.

55
00:06:08,994 --> 00:06:11,163
No, but it's guaranteed
to last ten years.

56
00:06:11,246 --> 00:06:13,123
He said at least ten years.

57
00:06:14,416 --> 00:06:17,211
You know, I ran into
Kathy Dumont at the club.

58
00:06:18,587 --> 00:06:23,133
She said you'd canceled her daughter's
riding lessons for the past six months.

59
00:06:23,217 --> 00:06:25,093
Hilary Stafford told
me the same thing.

60
00:06:25,969 --> 00:06:27,429
Look, I'm sorry you lost Patty,

61
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:31,058
but I can't continue to pour
money into a failing business,

62
00:06:31,767 --> 00:06:33,477
especially 'cause we're
not married anymore.

63
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:35,646
And I never wanted that
farm in the first place.

64
00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:38,899
If you can't make it work,
you're gonna have to sell it.

65
00:06:38,982 --> 00:06:40,234
Bye, Richard.

66
00:06:40,859 --> 00:06:41,735
Bye, Dad.

67
00:06:41,818 --> 00:06:44,321
Bye. Nice to see you guys.

68
00:06:44,404 --> 00:06:46,323
-Have fun.
-I'm late. Let's go.

69
00:06:58,585 --> 00:06:59,753
Thanks.

70
00:07:02,005 --> 00:07:03,799
I'm guessing you haven't
heard from Claire.

71
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:06,677
She showed up here last week.

72
00:07:08,136 --> 00:07:10,848
Three o'clock in the morning and
she's pounding on the front door.

73
00:07:10,931 --> 00:07:12,224
What did she want? I me...

74
00:07:12,307 --> 00:07:14,351
What does she
always want? Money.

75
00:07:14,434 --> 00:07:18,981
And it doesn't help that you continue
to give her anything she wants.

76
00:07:19,064 --> 00:07:20,315
She's our daughter, Richard.

77
00:07:20,399 --> 00:07:21,775
-What...
-We made promises

78
00:07:21,859 --> 00:07:24,111
when we sat down with the
counselor, do you remember?

79
00:07:24,194 --> 00:07:26,822
-We both made pledges not to enable...
-Yes. You know I tried.

80
00:07:26,905 --> 00:07:29,658
-You know I tried...
-You never tried, Kate.

81
00:07:30,659 --> 00:07:35,831
She'll show up and give you that smile and
you'll gladly pretend everything is fine.

82
00:07:35,914 --> 00:07:38,625
It's not fine. Our
daughter is very sick.

83
00:08:31,553 --> 00:08:33,514
He only barks when
you come home.

84
00:08:35,265 --> 00:08:36,433
Are you feeding him enough?

85
00:08:36,517 --> 00:08:39,686
-He's about to eat my hand off.
-Stop it. Come on, he's fine.

86
00:08:40,645 --> 00:08:42,773
I missed you so much.

87
00:08:42,856 --> 00:08:43,899
I missed you more.

88
00:08:47,903 --> 00:08:49,905
What is going on
with your hair, Mom?

89
00:08:49,988 --> 00:08:51,698
I could ask you the same thing.

90
00:08:51,782 --> 00:08:54,368
Okay, well, I'm gonna call
and make you an appointment.

91
00:08:54,451 --> 00:08:56,870
You really need to start
taking care of yourself again.

92
00:08:57,704 --> 00:08:59,456
Why didn't you call me back?

93
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:00,749
It's a long story.

94
00:09:00,832 --> 00:09:05,003
Speaking of, can I have your
iPad so I can check my messages?

95
00:09:05,796 --> 00:09:07,923
Okay. Where were you?

96
00:09:08,006 --> 00:09:11,009
A couple of Ryan's friends rented
a house down in Dewey Beach.

97
00:09:12,094 --> 00:09:13,679
You didn't get my messages?

98
00:09:13,762 --> 00:09:14,972
No, my phone died.

99
00:09:15,055 --> 00:09:16,139
We just bought it.

100
00:09:16,223 --> 00:09:17,767
-It broke already?
-Ryan threw it into the ocean

101
00:09:17,850 --> 00:09:19,268
like a Hail Mary pass. Like...

102
00:09:20,477 --> 00:09:21,728
Splash. Fish food.

103
00:09:21,812 --> 00:09:23,021
Why did he do that?

104
00:09:23,105 --> 00:09:25,274
'Cause he is a fuckface.

105
00:09:27,317 --> 00:09:28,694
Don't worry, I got him back.

106
00:09:28,777 --> 00:09:31,780
Before I left, I went into his
closet, and I gathered up all his shit

107
00:09:31,864 --> 00:09:33,323
and I threw it over
the 21st bridge.

108
00:09:33,407 --> 00:09:36,618
He is probably freaking
the fuck out right now.

109
00:09:37,494 --> 00:09:39,246
Oh, my God. He totally is.

110
00:09:40,581 --> 00:09:41,874
Mission accomplished.

111
00:09:45,669 --> 00:09:46,962
Oh, Claire, come on.

112
00:09:47,045 --> 00:09:49,381
Well, that's what happens when
you send dick pics to skanks

113
00:09:49,464 --> 00:09:50,757
in front of your girlfriend.

114
00:09:50,841 --> 00:09:52,384
Maybe you should
break up with him.

115
00:09:52,467 --> 00:09:53,844
I am going. Sprinting.

116
00:09:53,927 --> 00:09:55,596
But first, I need...

117
00:09:55,679 --> 00:09:58,432
I need a phone, so
can we go to Verizon?

118
00:10:01,351 --> 00:10:03,937
Yeah, let me put the horses
in and we can then ride over.

119
00:10:04,646 --> 00:10:06,982
<i>You hungry? You want
a grilled cheese?</i>

120
00:10:07,065 --> 00:10:08,692
<i>I am starving.</i>

121
00:10:15,407 --> 00:10:16,491
So...

122
00:10:18,994 --> 00:10:20,204
are you feeling good?

123
00:10:22,122 --> 00:10:24,041
I'm clean, Mom. I'm good.

124
00:10:26,710 --> 00:10:28,253
So happy you're here.

125
00:10:43,101 --> 00:10:45,521
Are you getting jealous?
Are you getting jealous?

126
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:52,361
You wanna go for a swim
tomorrow down at Marsh Lake?

127
00:10:52,444 --> 00:10:53,904
It'll be good for you.

128
00:10:53,987 --> 00:10:55,447
Yeah, well, we'll see.

129
00:10:56,031 --> 00:10:58,868
Remember when I was little, and I was
convinced a ghost lived in the lake?

130
00:10:58,951 --> 00:11:02,162
Yes, of course I remember that.

131
00:11:02,871 --> 00:11:05,082
You called her Ariel, right?

132
00:11:05,165 --> 00:11:06,792
-No, Aurora.
-Aurora.

133
00:11:06,875 --> 00:11:08,627
The ghost of Marsh Creek Lake.

134
00:11:10,254 --> 00:11:11,588
So scary.

135
00:11:14,591 --> 00:11:15,592
No, I got it.

136
00:11:22,683 --> 00:11:24,351
Where's my stuff?

137
00:11:24,434 --> 00:11:26,228
Oh, my God. What
happened to your face?

138
00:11:26,311 --> 00:11:28,522
Stop fucking around,
Claire. I know you took it.

139
00:11:28,605 --> 00:11:30,107
Ryan, I don't know what
you're talking about.

140
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:35,612
Do you have any idea how much fucking
trouble I'm in right now because of you?

141
00:11:35,696 --> 00:11:38,323
There was a half a
fucking kilo in my bag.

142
00:11:38,824 --> 00:11:40,367
Well, I told Jackie
that you stole it.

143
00:11:40,450 --> 00:11:42,286
-So if you don't give it back...
-What?

144
00:11:42,369 --> 00:11:44,497
-You told Jackie?
-...he's gonna come looking for you.

145
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:46,373
Ryan, what the fuck is
the matter with you?

146
00:11:46,456 --> 00:11:47,625
Why the fuck would
you do that to me?

147
00:11:47,708 --> 00:11:49,334
Because I'm fucking
scared, that's why.

148
00:11:49,418 --> 00:11:52,098
-You know what Jackie's like.
-Ryan, do not tell him where I live.

149
00:11:52,796 --> 00:11:54,840
Do not tell Jackie
where I fucking live!

150
00:11:54,923 --> 00:11:55,924
Hey.

151
00:11:56,008 --> 00:11:58,552
Hey, everything okay here?

152
00:12:00,888 --> 00:12:01,889
I'm going out.

153
00:12:02,431 --> 00:12:03,431
Go where?

154
00:12:04,016 --> 00:12:05,475
Where are you going?

155
00:12:41,094 --> 00:12:43,013
Honey? You okay?

156
00:12:47,351 --> 00:12:48,351
Claire?

157
00:12:48,936 --> 00:12:50,896
Claire? Claire?

158
00:12:52,981 --> 00:12:53,981
Claire.

159
00:12:56,860 --> 00:12:59,154
Stand up for me. Come
on, stand up for me.

160
00:12:59,238 --> 00:13:00,280
There you go.

161
00:13:00,364 --> 00:13:02,449
Okay. There you go.

162
00:13:51,874 --> 00:13:52,875
Claire.

163
00:13:56,545 --> 00:13:59,131
Honey, I need to talk
to you about last night.

164
00:13:59,798 --> 00:14:01,091
I'm gonna go take a dip.

165
00:14:01,175 --> 00:14:02,759
You can't keep avoiding this.

166
00:14:14,396 --> 00:14:15,439
Okay.

167
00:14:17,524 --> 00:14:20,611
Trip number 15. I think my
arms are gonna fall off.

168
00:14:20,694 --> 00:14:22,196
I remember those days.

169
00:14:24,531 --> 00:14:25,741
Tell me it gets easier.

170
00:14:25,824 --> 00:14:28,160
Oh, God, no. Just you wait.

171
00:14:30,329 --> 00:14:31,538
I'm just kidding.

172
00:14:32,456 --> 00:14:33,916
Every day is a gift.

173
00:15:05,030 --> 00:15:09,117
Okay, do you guys want me to
do a front flip or a backflip?

174
00:15:09,201 --> 00:15:10,244
Backflip!

175
00:15:10,327 --> 00:15:12,454
You guys have to promise me
you're not gonna try this.

176
00:15:12,538 --> 00:15:13,872
You have to pinkie
promise, okay?

177
00:15:13,956 --> 00:15:15,374
Let me see all of you.

178
00:15:15,457 --> 00:15:17,960
-We pinkie promise.
-That's not a pinkie!

179
00:15:18,043 --> 00:15:19,002
-Yes it is.
-Now, go!

180
00:15:19,086 --> 00:15:20,420
Okay!

181
00:15:21,088 --> 00:15:24,216
Three, two, one.

182
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:39,189
-Hey.
-Hey.

183
00:15:40,524 --> 00:15:43,527
You know, an ad popped up
on my computer the other day

184
00:15:44,111 --> 00:15:46,154
from Chester Community College.

185
00:15:47,364 --> 00:15:49,575
Mom, an ad doesn't just
pop up on your computer.

186
00:15:50,075 --> 00:15:51,452
It's there 'cause
you searched for it.

187
00:15:51,535 --> 00:15:53,787
Well, it doesn't matter
how it got there.

188
00:15:53,871 --> 00:15:57,583
What matters is that they
offer creative writing classes.

189
00:15:57,666 --> 00:15:59,251
Why does that matter?

190
00:15:59,334 --> 00:16:02,713
Well, because you should think
about going back to school.

191
00:16:02,796 --> 00:16:03,881
And you're a great writer.

192
00:16:03,964 --> 00:16:06,884
What have I written that makes
you think I'm such a great writer?

193
00:16:06,967 --> 00:16:08,552
That short story you wrote

194
00:16:10,095 --> 00:16:13,098
about the mother who loses
her child at the zoo.

195
00:16:13,765 --> 00:16:15,642
What do you think it was about?

196
00:16:16,476 --> 00:16:17,978
I think that, for me...

197
00:16:20,272 --> 00:16:21,607
it was about regret.

198
00:16:26,278 --> 00:16:28,488
That's not what I
intended it to be about.

199
00:16:30,282 --> 00:16:33,535
So I guess it was a failure,
just like the rest of my life.

200
00:16:34,328 --> 00:16:36,330
You know, I hate it when
you say things like that.

201
00:17:07,611 --> 00:17:09,029
Hello, sweetheart.

202
00:17:10,614 --> 00:17:11,656
How you doing?

203
00:17:14,117 --> 00:17:16,578
I didn't realize you grew
up all the way out here.

204
00:17:17,621 --> 00:17:20,332
Man, horses and green grass...

205
00:17:21,666 --> 00:17:22,917
It's beautiful.

206
00:17:24,002 --> 00:17:25,337
Just like you.

207
00:17:28,966 --> 00:17:31,093
How'd you find me
out here, Jackie?

208
00:17:33,387 --> 00:17:34,387
Hey.

209
00:17:36,056 --> 00:17:37,140
Come on.

210
00:17:39,226 --> 00:17:40,227
Man.

211
00:17:41,353 --> 00:17:45,232
You know, for the life of me I do
not understand what you see in him,

212
00:17:45,983 --> 00:17:47,776
'cause I see the
way you look at me.

213
00:17:48,986 --> 00:17:51,947
I don't look at you
any way, Jackie.

214
00:17:54,116 --> 00:17:55,409
No?

215
00:17:56,285 --> 00:17:57,286
No.

216
00:18:02,624 --> 00:18:03,792
Where's my shit?

217
00:18:05,210 --> 00:18:07,254
I don't have it.

218
00:18:08,046 --> 00:18:09,214
You don't have it?

219
00:18:09,923 --> 00:18:11,509
I threw it away by
mistake and I'm sorry.

220
00:18:11,592 --> 00:18:12,843
I didn't know your shit
was inside, Jackie.

221
00:18:12,926 --> 00:18:14,469
-I didn't know.
-Fucking dumb bitch.

222
00:18:14,553 --> 00:18:16,638
The fuck's wrong with you?
What'd you fucking do?

223
00:18:21,685 --> 00:18:23,604
Hey! Leave her alone.

224
00:18:24,688 --> 00:18:25,688
What?

225
00:18:27,191 --> 00:18:28,275
What'd you say?

226
00:18:28,358 --> 00:18:29,443
What?

227
00:18:33,864 --> 00:18:34,948
Fuck!

228
00:18:37,784 --> 00:18:38,784
Fuck!

229
00:18:39,119 --> 00:18:42,039
-Where you going? Come here.
-Jackie.

230
00:18:42,122 --> 00:18:43,123
Come here.

231
00:18:43,207 --> 00:18:45,083
Come here. What? What?

232
00:18:45,167 --> 00:18:46,168
No, no, it's okay.

233
00:18:46,251 --> 00:18:47,961
Sorry, I didn't mean
to hit you that hard.

234
00:18:48,045 --> 00:18:50,422
Just breathe. You just
gotta breathe nice and slow.

235
00:18:51,006 --> 00:18:53,217
Breathe nice and slow.
You're all right.

236
00:19:01,558 --> 00:19:04,144
Hey! Get away from her!

237
00:19:05,103 --> 00:19:06,855
Get the hell off of her.

238
00:19:06,939 --> 00:19:07,940
You okay?

239
00:19:08,023 --> 00:19:09,023
Come on.

240
00:19:10,651 --> 00:19:12,110
What's going on here?

241
00:19:12,194 --> 00:19:14,363
I'm really sorry, Ms. Garretson.

242
00:19:14,446 --> 00:19:15,948
Hey, you must be Claire's mom.

243
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:19,076
I was just commentating on
how beautiful it is out here.

244
00:19:19,159 --> 00:19:20,494
-The horses...
-Who are you?

245
00:19:22,704 --> 00:19:24,831
I'm a close friend
of your daughter's.

246
00:19:25,749 --> 00:19:26,959
Unfortunately, she...

247
00:19:27,876 --> 00:19:31,338
Look, she betrayed my trust, and she took
something that didn't belong to her...

248
00:19:31,421 --> 00:19:32,297
She didn't steal it.

249
00:19:32,381 --> 00:19:34,258
-She threw it away.
-Shut up.

250
00:19:34,341 --> 00:19:37,135
And it's put me in a very
bad spot with some people

251
00:19:37,219 --> 00:19:39,179
I'd prefer not to be
in a bad spot with.

252
00:19:39,263 --> 00:19:40,973
Stay away from him,
Mom! He's crazy!

253
00:19:41,056 --> 00:19:42,224
Claire, why would you say that

254
00:19:42,307 --> 00:19:43,600
-about a close friend?
-Hey!

255
00:19:43,684 --> 00:19:46,228
-He's not my friend, Mom!
-You need to leave or I'm...

256
00:19:46,311 --> 00:19:47,688
I'm gonna call the police.

257
00:19:53,402 --> 00:19:55,362
Okay, but just so
we're all clear,

258
00:19:56,154 --> 00:19:58,365
your junkie daughter
has two choices.

259
00:19:58,448 --> 00:20:01,994
Give it back, or she
can pay me my money.

260
00:20:05,038 --> 00:20:06,707
Get out of here.

261
00:20:08,333 --> 00:20:09,501
Come on.

262
00:20:09,585 --> 00:20:10,836
You fucking...

263
00:20:11,712 --> 00:20:13,046
Bye, Claire!

264
00:20:19,803 --> 00:20:20,971
Who the hell was that?

265
00:20:21,638 --> 00:20:24,641
Remember when I said I threw
Ryan's stuff off the bridge?

266
00:20:25,225 --> 00:20:27,978
-Well, there was something inside.
-You mean there were drugs inside.

267
00:20:28,061 --> 00:20:29,605
I didn't know it then, Mom.

268
00:20:29,688 --> 00:20:31,357
Honestly, I didn't know
when I threw it over.

269
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:34,026
That man knows where we live now,
Claire. What if he comes back?

270
00:20:34,109 --> 00:20:35,986
-He won't.
-No, you don't know that.

271
00:20:36,069 --> 00:20:37,487
Okay, I won't let him, Mom.

272
00:21:21,198 --> 00:21:22,741
Goddamn it, Claire.

273
00:21:33,752 --> 00:21:34,962
Really?

274
00:21:35,045 --> 00:21:36,046
Mom.

275
00:21:37,506 --> 00:21:39,007
Mom, let me explain.

276
00:21:42,845 --> 00:21:43,846
Mom.

277
00:21:50,811 --> 00:21:51,812
Mom.

278
00:21:52,896 --> 00:21:54,064
Mom!

279
00:21:54,147 --> 00:21:55,732
What's he doing here?

280
00:21:55,816 --> 00:21:57,359
I thought you were running.

281
00:21:59,444 --> 00:22:00,863
Ryan's in trouble because of me,

282
00:22:00,946 --> 00:22:03,740
and he wanted me to come
here and apologize to you

283
00:22:03,824 --> 00:22:05,993
-for bringing Jackie here earlier.
-I don't give a shit.

284
00:22:06,076 --> 00:22:07,202
I just want him gone.

285
00:22:08,078 --> 00:22:11,081
Well, that's why we're leaving.
We're gonna camp out for a few days.

286
00:22:11,748 --> 00:22:13,292
You mean you're gonna
use for a few days?

287
00:22:13,375 --> 00:22:16,128
No, Mom, we're gonna
camp out for a few days.

288
00:22:16,211 --> 00:22:17,129
Okay.

289
00:22:17,212 --> 00:22:19,256
Here, take this.

290
00:22:20,883 --> 00:22:22,759
Narcan. You know what?

291
00:22:24,219 --> 00:22:25,345
Take all of 'em

292
00:22:26,263 --> 00:22:27,890
in case you OD again.

293
00:22:33,645 --> 00:22:34,855
Mom, I need some money.

294
00:22:35,355 --> 00:22:37,649
Claire, just... just leave.

295
00:22:37,733 --> 00:22:41,195
Mom, I am leaving. I just need
some money for food and supplies.

296
00:22:41,278 --> 00:22:43,780
Food and supplies? Do you
think I'm that stupid?

297
00:22:43,864 --> 00:22:45,490
Ryan is in trouble
because of me, Mom.

298
00:22:45,574 --> 00:22:47,409
-I'm not giving you money.
-It's serious this time.

299
00:22:47,492 --> 00:22:49,912
-I made a pledge to your father...
-Oh, my God. The pledge!

300
00:22:49,995 --> 00:22:53,207
The fucking pledge! You and
Dad and your fucking pledge!

301
00:22:53,290 --> 00:22:55,000
I pledge allegiance to
neglect my daughter,

302
00:22:55,083 --> 00:22:57,753
-not give a flying fuck about her!
-Not give a fuck, really?

303
00:22:58,420 --> 00:23:01,340
-Mom, I need some money. Mom!
-I don't have any money!

304
00:23:01,423 --> 00:23:04,593
It's all gone towards getting you
better and clearly it hasn't worked.

305
00:23:07,137 --> 00:23:08,847
Mom, where are you going?

306
00:23:10,098 --> 00:23:12,100
Mom, I am in trouble.

307
00:23:12,184 --> 00:23:14,144
I need money, Mom.

308
00:23:15,312 --> 00:23:17,189
Mom, I need help.

309
00:23:17,272 --> 00:23:19,024
Mom, give me some money.

310
00:23:20,567 --> 00:23:22,110
Mom, open the door!

311
00:23:27,074 --> 00:23:29,201
Mom, open the door.
I need a check.

312
00:23:30,285 --> 00:23:31,703
Are we really doing this again?

313
00:23:31,787 --> 00:23:33,705
I'm just gonna cancel it anyway.

314
00:23:33,789 --> 00:23:36,208
No, you won't. You
won't cancel the check.

315
00:23:36,291 --> 00:23:37,752
Of course I'm gonna
cancel the check.

316
00:23:37,835 --> 00:23:40,546
-No, you won't cancel it this time, Mom.
-There's nothing in there.

317
00:23:40,629 --> 00:23:41,964
You've taken it all.

318
00:23:42,047 --> 00:23:44,883
I have to beg your father for
money just to keep the farm.

319
00:24:01,733 --> 00:24:03,569
What the fuck is wrong with you?

320
00:24:03,652 --> 00:24:05,028
Honey, are you hurt?

321
00:24:05,112 --> 00:24:06,113
Ryan!

322
00:24:06,196 --> 00:24:07,239
What?

323
00:24:07,781 --> 00:24:10,409
Ryan, get the dog and put
him in the back of my car!

324
00:24:10,492 --> 00:24:11,785
What are you doing?

325
00:24:13,036 --> 00:24:14,288
I'm gonna take Cooper.

326
00:24:14,371 --> 00:24:17,624
I'm gonna drive him so far away that he
will not be able to find his way home,

327
00:24:17,708 --> 00:24:19,334
and he's gonna starve or worse.

328
00:24:21,628 --> 00:24:23,005
Give me a check, Mom.

329
00:24:24,047 --> 00:24:25,090
Ryan!

330
00:24:25,174 --> 00:24:26,884
Ryan, did you get Cooper?

331
00:24:26,967 --> 00:24:28,260
I'm trying!

332
00:24:28,343 --> 00:24:30,513
Just find him and put him in
the back of the fucking car!

333
00:24:30,596 --> 00:24:31,847
Cooper!

334
00:24:31,930 --> 00:24:33,932
I don't know where
the hell he is!

335
00:24:36,602 --> 00:24:38,520
Ryan, well, hurry up!

336
00:24:40,606 --> 00:24:41,607
Cooper!

337
00:24:42,399 --> 00:24:44,193
What the fuck is the
matter with you, Mom?

338
00:24:44,276 --> 00:24:47,487
-Give me the fucking dog.
-No! No!

339
00:24:47,571 --> 00:24:48,822
Give me the fucking dog, Mom.

340
00:24:48,906 --> 00:24:50,032
-No!
-Give me the...

341
00:24:52,534 --> 00:24:55,495
Do you want me to pull all your
fucking disgusting hair out?

342
00:24:56,705 --> 00:24:57,623
Hey!

343
00:24:57,706 --> 00:24:59,291
-Let's go.
-Get the fuck off of me, Ryan!

344
00:24:59,374 --> 00:25:01,293
Get the fuck off of me!

345
00:25:02,586 --> 00:25:04,255
You got no friends,
Dad fucking hates you,

346
00:25:04,338 --> 00:25:06,882
do you know everybody fucking
hates you except for me?

347
00:25:07,549 --> 00:25:08,550
Fuck.

348
00:25:08,634 --> 00:25:10,135
Claire, let's go.

349
00:25:11,553 --> 00:25:13,055
Come on. We gotta go.

350
00:26:15,701 --> 00:26:16,785
Les?

351
00:26:17,619 --> 00:26:18,619
Well,

352
00:26:19,580 --> 00:26:20,539
hello.

353
00:26:20,622 --> 00:26:21,622
Hey.

354
00:26:22,499 --> 00:26:23,499
There you are.

355
00:26:24,668 --> 00:26:25,586
You look great.

356
00:26:25,669 --> 00:26:28,130
You're a sight for sore eyes.

357
00:26:28,213 --> 00:26:30,090
-It's been too long.
-Hi.

358
00:26:30,174 --> 00:26:32,342
<i>So what brings you
down here anyway?</i>

359
00:26:32,968 --> 00:26:36,388
I had to drop a trailer off at
Nelly Godschalk's at Derby Ranch.

360
00:26:37,097 --> 00:26:38,557
How is Nelly these days?

361
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:40,976
Oh, God, she's still
an awful old cunt.

362
00:26:41,476 --> 00:26:44,813
Every time I leave, I just wanna
punch her straight in the face.

363
00:26:44,897 --> 00:26:46,648
I haven't seen her in so long.

364
00:26:46,732 --> 00:26:47,732
I mean,

365
00:26:48,108 --> 00:26:49,568
haven't seen anybody really.

366
00:26:51,069 --> 00:26:53,614
Well, you're not
missing much. Trust me.

367
00:26:56,658 --> 00:26:58,619
So who's helping you
take care of the place?

368
00:26:59,286 --> 00:27:00,287
No one.

369
00:27:00,787 --> 00:27:02,206
No one?

370
00:27:02,289 --> 00:27:04,333
God, Kate, are you
out of your mind?

371
00:27:04,416 --> 00:27:06,960
It was always just me
and Patty, you know.

372
00:27:08,587 --> 00:27:09,838
How you holding up?

373
00:27:11,089 --> 00:27:12,090
I mean...

374
00:27:14,134 --> 00:27:16,220
Thank God I have the
horses to take care of,

375
00:27:16,303 --> 00:27:18,430
otherwise I wouldn't get
out of bed in the morning.

376
00:27:21,850 --> 00:27:23,477
It's only been nine months...

377
00:27:26,063 --> 00:27:27,314
and it was so sudden.

378
00:27:28,190 --> 00:27:30,400
Yeah, it was. Yeah.

379
00:27:31,068 --> 00:27:32,361
It was just...

380
00:27:37,699 --> 00:27:40,160
I can't really talk about
her with anybody, you know?

381
00:27:43,038 --> 00:27:45,832
-You can always call me, you know that.
-I don't wanna bother you.

382
00:27:45,916 --> 00:27:48,836
-I don't wanna...
-You are never a bother.

383
00:27:51,797 --> 00:27:53,215
Thanks.

384
00:27:55,884 --> 00:27:59,596
Why don't I just stay and help out on the
farm today, and then I can stay the night?

385
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:01,682
You've got your own
stuff to take care of.

386
00:28:01,765 --> 00:28:02,975
Oh, shut up.

387
00:28:03,058 --> 00:28:04,810
Joan's mother's staying.

388
00:28:04,893 --> 00:28:06,687
God knows I could use
a vacation from her.

389
00:28:06,770 --> 00:28:08,522
We can make dinner,

390
00:28:09,314 --> 00:28:11,024
I don't know, get
drunk as skunks

391
00:28:12,150 --> 00:28:14,236
and laugh our tits off
just like old times.

392
00:28:15,362 --> 00:28:16,363
Okay.

393
00:28:18,866 --> 00:28:20,117
Okay.

394
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:21,493
All right.

395
00:28:23,203 --> 00:28:25,372
So you're teaching
riding lessons again?

396
00:28:26,164 --> 00:28:27,165
Trying to.

397
00:28:28,750 --> 00:28:30,127
I've been calling
my old clients.

398
00:28:31,128 --> 00:28:32,588
Yes, as good as new.

399
00:28:32,671 --> 00:28:34,298
I broke up our family.

400
00:28:34,381 --> 00:28:36,884
I'm the one who fell in love
with the "lesbo ranch hand,"

401
00:28:36,967 --> 00:28:38,468
as Richard liked to tell people.

402
00:28:39,094 --> 00:28:41,346
-Yeah.
-All right, I'll order some takeout soon.

403
00:28:41,430 --> 00:28:45,225
Order me anything,
except vegan turkey.

404
00:28:45,309 --> 00:28:46,602
Oh, my God.

405
00:28:46,685 --> 00:28:50,814
Do you remember the time Patty
served it on a silver platter?

406
00:28:50,898 --> 00:28:52,274
She was so proud of that.

407
00:28:52,357 --> 00:28:54,484
Christ. I mean, it tasted
like a thousand assholes.

408
00:28:54,568 --> 00:28:55,861
Yeah.

409
00:28:55,944 --> 00:28:57,029
And what about Claire?

410
00:28:58,947 --> 00:29:01,783
The last time we talked,
she was back in rehab.

411
00:29:04,786 --> 00:29:06,622
Yeah, she skipped out again.

412
00:29:09,333 --> 00:29:10,417
Jesus.

413
00:29:13,504 --> 00:29:16,548
I always thought I was too boring
for my life to be this messed up.

414
00:29:16,632 --> 00:29:18,550
Your life is not a mess.

415
00:29:18,634 --> 00:29:20,219
You're grieving, you lost Patty.

416
00:29:21,094 --> 00:29:23,180
I mean, there's no
road map for that shit.

417
00:29:26,183 --> 00:29:27,518
Fuck me.

418
00:29:27,601 --> 00:29:29,394
That's the Hallmark card.

419
00:29:29,937 --> 00:29:31,021
"Grief.

420
00:29:32,147 --> 00:29:34,274
There is no road
map for that shit."

421
00:29:36,693 --> 00:29:38,320
Fuck. Yeah.

422
00:30:30,414 --> 00:30:33,166
Now... Okay, let's get
a little rest here.

423
00:30:33,250 --> 00:30:35,377
-Okay, I wanna rest.
-Now, okay...

424
00:30:35,460 --> 00:30:37,296
One foot in front of the other.

425
00:30:37,379 --> 00:30:38,380
Easy.

426
00:30:38,463 --> 00:30:40,632
You see? We can still dance.

427
00:30:41,133 --> 00:30:42,968
Dance floor is closed.

428
00:30:44,887 --> 00:30:45,929
Fuck.

429
00:30:46,430 --> 00:30:47,431
My God.

430
00:30:47,514 --> 00:30:49,141
-That's my sock.
-Yeah, yeah.

431
00:30:49,224 --> 00:30:51,018
-I gotta go to bed.
-Here you go.

432
00:30:51,101 --> 00:30:52,227
I gotta go.

433
00:30:53,187 --> 00:30:55,355
Okay. Thank you.

434
00:30:55,439 --> 00:30:56,857
There you are.

435
00:31:10,204 --> 00:31:11,371
Les?

436
00:31:35,103 --> 00:31:37,606
<i>Hey, sweetheart. I found
Claire and calmed her down.</i>

437
00:31:37,689 --> 00:31:40,651
<i>She feels terrible
about what happened.</i>

438
00:31:42,236 --> 00:31:44,655
<i>We're gonna grab a quick
bite, and I'll bring her home.</i>

439
00:31:45,155 --> 00:31:47,449
<i>This snowstorm is crazy.</i>

440
00:31:47,533 --> 00:31:51,662
<i>There is so much snow on the road,
so it's going to take us a while.</i>

441
00:31:51,745 --> 00:31:52,704
<i>Get some rest.</i>

442
00:31:52,788 --> 00:31:55,123
A little more
outside connection.

443
00:31:57,417 --> 00:31:59,419
-Good.
-Straighten up, Mal.

444
00:31:59,503 --> 00:32:01,880
For fuck's sake, you look
like Quasimodo out there.

445
00:32:01,964 --> 00:32:03,423
Emma, do you mind?

446
00:32:03,507 --> 00:32:06,009
Mom, she literally just
said I was doing good.

447
00:32:06,093 --> 00:32:07,928
Use any of the bone
structure you have...

448
00:32:08,011 --> 00:32:10,889
-God, can you stop for one minute?
-...to keep yourself upright.

449
00:32:12,057 --> 00:32:13,892
Nice and easy.

450
00:33:02,900 --> 00:33:04,276
What are you doing here?

451
00:33:06,528 --> 00:33:08,113
I need help.

452
00:33:14,328 --> 00:33:15,328
Okay.

453
00:33:16,413 --> 00:33:18,957
Okay. Okay. Let's
get this off of you.

454
00:33:21,335 --> 00:33:22,419
Are you bleeding?

455
00:33:22,503 --> 00:33:24,213
I'm not. I'm sorry, Mom.

456
00:33:28,383 --> 00:33:29,718
It's Ryan's.

457
00:33:34,932 --> 00:33:36,099
Okay.

458
00:33:38,685 --> 00:33:39,685
Okay.

459
00:33:41,563 --> 00:33:44,316
Okay, calm down. Breathe.

460
00:33:48,070 --> 00:33:50,239
We went camping, and we
started arguing again.

461
00:33:50,322 --> 00:33:52,533
And I promise I didn't know
what was in the bag, Mom.

462
00:33:52,616 --> 00:33:55,202
-I didn't know what was inside.
-I know. I believe you.

463
00:33:58,789 --> 00:34:00,040
I pushed him.

464
00:34:02,459 --> 00:34:04,127
I didn't mean to
do it so hard, Mom.

465
00:34:06,713 --> 00:34:10,759
And then he fell over the slope,
and he hit his head and it just...

466
00:34:12,678 --> 00:34:14,054
Just opened up.

467
00:34:15,389 --> 00:34:16,598
What opened up, honey? What...

468
00:34:16,681 --> 00:34:18,016
His head, it just...

469
00:34:19,434 --> 00:34:21,728
There was just blood
everywhere, Mom.

470
00:34:21,812 --> 00:34:22,813
Just...

471
00:34:27,067 --> 00:34:28,443
Is he okay?

472
00:34:38,536 --> 00:34:39,996
Did you call the police?

473
00:34:42,165 --> 00:34:43,542
-No.
-Why?

474
00:34:44,877 --> 00:34:46,753
It was an accident. It was...

475
00:34:46,837 --> 00:34:49,464
He... You were arguing and
he fell, and he hit his head.

476
00:34:49,547 --> 00:34:50,507
That's not a crime.

477
00:34:50,591 --> 00:34:53,342
-There's no reason to not call the...
-No. He didn't fall, Mom. No.

478
00:34:53,427 --> 00:34:55,762
I hit him with a rock.

479
00:34:57,973 --> 00:34:59,850
He was getting so
angry, and I got scared

480
00:34:59,933 --> 00:35:02,644
and he was coming at me
and I just... I... Mom.

481
00:35:04,730 --> 00:35:06,440
Mom, what do we
do? What do we...

482
00:35:06,523 --> 00:35:07,691
What do we...

483
00:35:26,126 --> 00:35:27,586
Where is Ryan now?

484
00:36:45,539 --> 00:36:46,957
I'm gonna ask you
some questions,

485
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:49,668
and you need to be completely
honest with me, okay?

486
00:36:52,296 --> 00:36:53,547
Where did you go?

487
00:36:53,630 --> 00:36:54,965
Valley Forge.

488
00:36:56,300 --> 00:36:57,467
We just...

489
00:36:58,385 --> 00:36:59,970
We just parked
and picked a spot.

490
00:37:00,053 --> 00:37:01,555
Did you check in?

491
00:37:01,638 --> 00:37:03,348
I mean, was there
a check-in station?

492
00:37:03,432 --> 00:37:05,184
No, it wasn't
anything like that.

493
00:37:05,267 --> 00:37:08,395
We just parked on the side
of the street and then we...

494
00:37:08,478 --> 00:37:10,147
We just walked deep
into the woods.

495
00:37:11,315 --> 00:37:12,774
Did anyone see you?

496
00:37:12,858 --> 00:37:13,859
No.

497
00:37:14,693 --> 00:37:18,697
No one saw you park, and no
one saw you in the woods?

498
00:37:21,074 --> 00:37:22,075
Yeah, we just...

499
00:37:22,159 --> 00:37:24,244
-We just parked and...
-Claire, it's important.

500
00:37:24,328 --> 00:37:25,329
No, Mom. I mean...

501
00:37:26,079 --> 00:37:27,414
God, I don't think
they did, Mom.

502
00:37:27,497 --> 00:37:29,792
We got there so late the first
night and then the next day,

503
00:37:29,875 --> 00:37:32,377
we went for a walk, so maybe
people could have seen us

504
00:37:32,461 --> 00:37:34,713
-down by the water, I guess.
-Yeah. Okay.

505
00:37:42,221 --> 00:37:43,222
Yeah.

506
00:37:47,768 --> 00:37:49,394
Do you have Ryan's cell phone?

507
00:38:02,282 --> 00:38:04,826
Does anyone know where
the two of you were?

508
00:38:06,495 --> 00:38:07,538
No.

509
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:13,877
Okay, go upstairs, take off all
your clothes, and put them in a bag

510
00:38:13,961 --> 00:38:15,921
and don't leave your
bedroom till I come back.

511
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:18,215
Come back from where?

512
00:38:19,925 --> 00:38:21,343
Just do what I say.

513
00:42:09,154 --> 00:42:10,864
Let's go.

514
00:44:11,068 --> 00:44:12,402
What'd you do?

515
00:44:14,029 --> 00:44:15,239
I took care of it.

516
00:44:17,074 --> 00:44:18,075
All of it.

517
00:44:26,458 --> 00:44:28,460
Will you stay with
me for a little bit?

518
00:44:58,282 --> 00:45:00,742
<i>We need to go
through a few things</i>

519
00:45:00,826 --> 00:45:04,663
<i>so that we're on the same
page, in case anyone asks.</i>

520
00:45:04,746 --> 00:45:07,082
<i>So, the two of you came
back here after camping,</i>

521
00:45:07,165 --> 00:45:11,712
<i>you got into an argument, I
witnessed it, and then Ryan left.</i>

522
00:45:12,462 --> 00:45:14,715
<i>Wait. Why would we say Ryan
was here? Would we not...</i>

523
00:45:14,798 --> 00:45:16,842
<i>Because you brought his
cell phone back here,</i>

524
00:45:16,925 --> 00:45:21,013
<i>and if the police check phone records,
they'll know that he was here.</i>

525
00:45:21,096 --> 00:45:22,931
<i>So that's our story.</i>

526
00:45:23,015 --> 00:45:27,102
The two of you came back here after
camping, you got into an argument,

527
00:45:27,186 --> 00:45:32,649
I witnessed it, and then Ryan left, and
then you stayed here with me all night.

528
00:45:35,736 --> 00:45:36,945
Where is he?

529
00:45:38,822 --> 00:45:40,365
Marsh Creek Lake.

530
00:45:40,949 --> 00:45:42,159
The lake? Why the lake?

531
00:45:42,242 --> 00:45:44,369
Because it was late,
Claire, and I didn't think

532
00:45:44,453 --> 00:45:46,533
-that I would have time to bury him...
-Oh, my God.

533
00:45:47,539 --> 00:45:49,458
-Oh, my God. Mom.
-It's...

534
00:45:49,541 --> 00:45:51,043
Claire, you have to
be strong for me.

535
00:45:51,126 --> 00:45:52,294
-Can you do that?
-Oh, my God.

536
00:45:52,377 --> 00:45:54,880
-Stop. Stop saying that, Mom.
-You have to. You...

537
00:45:56,006 --> 00:45:58,175
I didn't ask you to do anything.
I didn't tell you to go...

538
00:45:58,258 --> 00:46:00,928
You didn't have to tell me.
I did it because I love you.

539
00:46:01,011 --> 00:46:03,972
I love you, Claire, and I won't
let anything happen to you.

540
00:46:45,848 --> 00:46:47,057
What's wrong?

541
00:46:47,140 --> 00:46:48,100
Jackie.

542
00:46:48,183 --> 00:46:49,059
Jackie who?

543
00:46:49,142 --> 00:46:50,894
The guy who was here before.

544
00:46:51,562 --> 00:46:52,771
The one Ryan owes money to.

545
00:46:52,855 --> 00:46:55,616
He followed me to the store, and he
said he was gonna fucking kill me.

546
00:46:55,774 --> 00:46:56,692
What did he say?

547
00:46:56,775 --> 00:46:59,152
He came up to me and he jammed
a gun right under my chin.

548
00:46:59,236 --> 00:47:01,071
-He said he's going to fucking kill me.
-Okay. Calm down.

549
00:47:01,154 --> 00:47:03,532
I'm freaking out right now
because he's asking about Ryan,

550
00:47:03,615 --> 00:47:05,117
and the more people
he asks about Ryan,

551
00:47:05,200 --> 00:47:07,036
they're gonna start
questioning where he is and...

552
00:47:07,119 --> 00:47:08,829
How much money does Ryan owe?

553
00:47:08,912 --> 00:47:09,913
Ten thousand.

554
00:47:15,419 --> 00:47:17,421
-Bodies float.
-What?

555
00:47:18,380 --> 00:47:20,841
I read that bodies float,
especially when it's...

556
00:47:20,924 --> 00:47:22,759
When it's hot out
like it is right now.

557
00:47:22,843 --> 00:47:26,513
This bacteria grows in the gut
and the chest fills with gas

558
00:47:26,597 --> 00:47:28,432
and then they float
to the surface.

559
00:47:56,793 --> 00:47:58,420
Finally came to your senses.

560
00:47:58,962 --> 00:48:01,757
This is what my daughter
owes, so it's the end of it.

561
00:48:04,092 --> 00:48:05,886
You're making the rules now?

562
00:48:05,969 --> 00:48:07,137
Huh, Mom?

563
00:48:11,183 --> 00:48:12,434
Nice.

564
00:48:13,685 --> 00:48:15,020
You give lessons out here?

565
00:48:17,231 --> 00:48:18,649
Horse lessons?

566
00:48:19,358 --> 00:48:24,488
I always wanted to ride a horse, and I
just recently came into some money, so...

567
00:48:24,571 --> 00:48:26,949
I never wanna see you on
this property ever again.

568
00:48:27,032 --> 00:48:28,242
You understand me?

569
00:48:34,373 --> 00:48:36,041
It must be fucking awful.

570
00:48:38,126 --> 00:48:39,127
What?

571
00:48:40,671 --> 00:48:42,047
Having a kid like that.

572
00:48:43,632 --> 00:48:45,509
Always having to
clean up their shit.

573
00:49:09,157 --> 00:49:10,158
It's over.

574
00:49:10,659 --> 00:49:12,286
He won't bother us anymore.

575
00:49:33,974 --> 00:49:35,976
Let's get up. Time
for breakfast.

576
00:49:53,702 --> 00:49:55,495
<i>Hey. This is Claire's phone.</i>

577
00:49:55,579 --> 00:49:56,872
<i>Just text me instead.</i>

578
00:49:57,414 --> 00:49:59,082
Hey. It's me.

579
00:49:59,166 --> 00:50:00,918
I'm just checking to
see where you are.

580
00:50:02,127 --> 00:50:03,128
Call me.

581
00:50:03,212 --> 00:50:04,755
Change your diagonal.

582
00:50:05,339 --> 00:50:06,340
Good job.

583
00:50:09,426 --> 00:50:10,469
Excellent.

584
00:50:11,303 --> 00:50:12,596
Keep breathing.

585
00:51:19,454 --> 00:51:22,875
<i>Can I have your iPad so I can
log in and check my messages?</i>

586
00:52:45,082 --> 00:52:47,626
Hey, I don't understand
how you can sit there

587
00:52:47,709 --> 00:52:49,503
and fucking watch TV all day.

588
00:52:49,586 --> 00:52:52,422
I wanna fucking
watch TV all day.

589
00:53:18,115 --> 00:53:19,741
Your fucking mom is outside.

590
00:53:20,450 --> 00:53:21,285
What?

591
00:53:21,368 --> 00:53:22,411
Claire.

592
00:53:23,120 --> 00:53:24,788
Claire, open the door.

593
00:53:24,872 --> 00:53:26,999
Let's go. Get off the
fucking couch. Let's go.

594
00:53:27,082 --> 00:53:29,459
-Claire. Open the door.
-She fucking knows.

595
00:53:29,543 --> 00:53:31,086
-What's going on?
-Let's fucking go.

596
00:53:31,170 --> 00:53:32,379
-Get your fucking shit.
-Come on.

597
00:53:32,462 --> 00:53:34,715
-Ryan!
-Out the back. Come on.

598
00:53:36,425 --> 00:53:37,425
Open it!

599
00:53:43,348 --> 00:53:44,933
-Claire.
-Let's go.

600
00:53:45,017 --> 00:53:46,017
Fuck!

601
00:53:46,518 --> 00:53:47,519
Come on.

602
00:53:48,645 --> 00:53:50,022
Claire, get out of the car.

603
00:53:50,105 --> 00:53:52,149
Get out of the car
and talk to me.

604
00:53:52,232 --> 00:53:53,358
Whose body was that?

605
00:53:53,442 --> 00:53:54,985
-Close the door!
-I can't!

606
00:53:55,068 --> 00:53:56,403
Tell me what you did to me.

607
00:53:56,987 --> 00:53:59,114
Claire. Come on. Get out.

608
00:53:59,198 --> 00:54:01,116
-Ryan! No!
-Fuck off!

609
00:54:01,200 --> 00:54:02,242
For fuck's sake.

610
00:54:05,078 --> 00:54:06,997
Claire, please open the door.

611
00:54:07,623 --> 00:54:08,665
Please.

612
00:55:20,237 --> 00:55:22,406
Just so you know, if you end
up going over the two hours,

613
00:55:22,489 --> 00:55:24,409
we're gonna have to charge
you for the whole day.

614
00:55:24,908 --> 00:55:26,869
-Yeah. Two hours will be fine.
-Okay.

615
00:55:27,870 --> 00:55:30,038
-Is this one good?
-Yeah. Thank you.

616
00:57:06,969 --> 00:57:09,471
-Afternoon.
-Hey. Hi.

617
00:57:10,597 --> 00:57:14,059
-What are you doing out here?
-I'm not doing much of anything.

618
00:57:14,142 --> 00:57:16,353
Just swimming. Why?

619
00:57:17,020 --> 00:57:19,314
Girl on the beach there said
you'd gone over your time.

620
00:57:19,398 --> 00:57:21,149
-She was worried about you.
-Oh, no.

621
00:57:21,233 --> 00:57:22,359
I mean, I...

622
00:57:25,612 --> 00:57:27,072
I lost my wedding ring,

623
00:57:28,073 --> 00:57:29,908
and I thought I
would try to find it.

624
00:57:29,992 --> 00:57:31,285
It seems pretty stupid.

625
00:57:32,077 --> 00:57:34,413
Thought I could find
it in this big lake.

626
00:57:37,457 --> 00:57:38,750
You wanna hear something funny?

627
00:57:38,834 --> 00:57:39,877
Okay.

628
00:57:41,295 --> 00:57:43,005
I lost my ring on our honeymoon.

629
00:57:43,922 --> 00:57:45,090
Down in the Keys.

630
00:57:45,924 --> 00:57:47,384
My wife was ready
to strangle me.

631
00:57:48,927 --> 00:57:51,054
Look, here's the
good, or bad news.

632
00:57:51,680 --> 00:57:53,807
You're still married, right?

633
00:57:54,892 --> 00:57:56,059
Yeah.

634
00:57:58,145 --> 00:57:59,563
Maybe call it a day, huh?

635
00:59:24,940 --> 00:59:27,985
<i>Everything I thought about
love was just an imitation.</i>

636
00:59:28,068 --> 00:59:32,406
<i>But now that I've stood in its
light, I never wanna be without it.</i>

637
00:59:33,782 --> 00:59:36,243
<i>Okay, Patty. Your turn.</i>

638
00:59:36,326 --> 00:59:37,202
<i>Here goes nothing.</i>

639
00:59:37,286 --> 00:59:39,955
<i>Kate, my love.</i>

640
00:59:40,914 --> 00:59:43,542
<i>I've spent my whole
life searching for home.</i>

641
00:59:43,625 --> 00:59:48,297
<i>Home is a place of
comfort, refuge.</i>

642
00:59:49,798 --> 00:59:50,841
<i>You are my home.</i>

643
00:59:51,675 --> 00:59:56,096
<i>And the best part of today is that
it's just the beginning for us.</i>

644
00:59:57,014 --> 00:59:58,974
<i>And now you can kiss the bride.</i>

645
01:00:17,826 --> 01:00:20,662
Jesus Christ. It's two
o'clock in the morning.

646
01:00:21,705 --> 01:00:23,248
Is everything all right?

647
01:00:23,832 --> 01:00:25,000
<i>Not really.</i>

648
01:00:28,795 --> 01:00:29,796
What's wrong?

649
01:00:31,965 --> 01:00:33,217
Everything.

650
01:00:37,554 --> 01:00:38,555
Hi.

651
01:00:41,475 --> 01:00:42,768
What are you doing here?

652
01:00:44,770 --> 01:00:47,022
Is everything you told
me last night true?

653
01:00:54,530 --> 01:00:55,948
Yeah.

654
01:00:56,740 --> 01:00:58,116
Jesus Christ.

655
01:00:59,368 --> 01:01:01,912
Yeah, you're coming
with me to Wildvale.

656
01:01:02,412 --> 01:01:04,706
I can't leave the horses, so...

657
01:01:05,666 --> 01:01:07,417
I've taken care of everything.

658
01:01:07,501 --> 01:01:11,672
Two friends from Denise
Denman's ranch are driving down.

659
01:01:11,755 --> 01:01:13,340
They're gonna be
here in 30 minutes.

660
01:01:16,468 --> 01:01:19,263
You need to rest for a few days
and then we'll figure this out.

661
01:01:21,265 --> 01:01:22,975
Kate, get packed.

662
01:01:50,043 --> 01:01:51,503
Anything interesting...

663
01:01:57,301 --> 01:01:58,510
We're here.

664
01:01:59,136 --> 01:02:00,137
Hi.

665
01:02:02,598 --> 01:02:04,141
Aw, sweetie.

666
01:02:06,894 --> 01:02:08,979
Les told me that you're
going through it.

667
01:02:09,688 --> 01:02:11,148
Yeah, a little bit. Yeah.

668
01:02:15,277 --> 01:02:16,445
I made you some tea.

669
01:02:18,197 --> 01:02:19,323
Thank you.

670
01:02:20,324 --> 01:02:21,325
Here.

671
01:02:22,618 --> 01:02:24,286
-You know the way.
-Okay.

672
01:02:24,369 --> 01:02:26,330
No, I got it. I got it. Yeah.

673
01:02:26,413 --> 01:02:27,497
All right.

674
01:02:45,057 --> 01:02:46,183
She called your mother?

675
01:02:46,266 --> 01:02:49,061
-Oh, God. What did she say?
-Damn right.

676
01:02:49,561 --> 01:02:53,398
"We found Les and another
female in the barn.

677
01:02:54,149 --> 01:02:55,984
They were doing
things to each other."

678
01:02:56,068 --> 01:02:58,654
"What kind of things?"
my mother said.

679
01:02:59,404 --> 01:03:02,658
"Well, we heard moaning
of a sexual nature."

680
01:03:03,325 --> 01:03:04,493
"Oh," it's my mother.

681
01:03:04,993 --> 01:03:07,955
"Wonderful. Sounds like they were
doing the right kind of things."

682
01:03:08,038 --> 01:03:09,748
I love that.

683
01:03:11,333 --> 01:03:14,670
Cheers to Mrs. Granderson and
her long-suffering husband.

684
01:03:17,798 --> 01:03:20,133
How is old Mr. Granderson?

685
01:03:20,217 --> 01:03:22,177
Does he still have
that beautiful farm?

686
01:03:22,678 --> 01:03:24,555
The old man burned
the place down.

687
01:03:25,138 --> 01:03:27,057
He burned it down? Why?

688
01:03:27,558 --> 01:03:29,685
He got diagnosed
with Alzheimer's.

689
01:03:29,768 --> 01:03:32,437
He didn't want his kids to be
on the hook for long-term care,

690
01:03:32,521 --> 01:03:39,194
so he set fire to the hayloft one night,
trying to make it look like an accident

691
01:03:39,278 --> 01:03:41,363
so he'd collect the
insurance payout.

692
01:03:42,030 --> 01:03:43,657
But the police caught him.

693
01:03:47,911 --> 01:03:51,081
-Who's for a top-up? Kate?
-Yep. Yeah, I'll have a little.

694
01:03:51,164 --> 01:03:53,584
No. No, no. Not you.

695
01:03:53,667 --> 01:03:57,379
Looks like I'll be doing the
chores myself tomorrow morning.

696
01:03:57,462 --> 01:03:58,797
Thank you.

697
01:04:00,716 --> 01:04:02,050
-Ready?
-Yeah, God.

698
01:04:02,134 --> 01:04:03,886
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

699
01:04:17,316 --> 01:04:18,400
<i>Hello.</i>

700
01:04:19,860 --> 01:04:21,486
What are you doing at my house?

701
01:04:23,447 --> 01:04:24,448
Come on out.

702
01:04:25,365 --> 01:04:26,658
I'm not home right now.

703
01:04:26,742 --> 01:04:27,910
I'm hours away.

704
01:04:28,911 --> 01:04:30,245
Well, you should get home.

705
01:04:30,829 --> 01:04:31,955
We need to talk.

706
01:04:33,832 --> 01:04:35,000
About what?

707
01:04:36,251 --> 01:04:39,087
About the body you dumped
at Marsh Creek Lake.

708
01:04:43,342 --> 01:04:44,343
<i>You still there?</i>

709
01:04:45,511 --> 01:04:46,512
Yeah.

710
01:04:47,554 --> 01:04:50,682
You think it's important
that we talk now, right?

711
01:04:53,685 --> 01:04:54,937
I'll be home tomorrow.

712
01:04:55,437 --> 01:04:56,438
Noon.

713
01:05:35,686 --> 01:05:36,687
Come in.

714
01:05:44,152 --> 01:05:45,152
Hey.

715
01:06:13,223 --> 01:06:14,224
Who was it?

716
01:06:16,476 --> 01:06:17,853
Someone's cousin.

717
01:06:17,936 --> 01:06:19,146
Someone's brother.

718
01:06:19,229 --> 01:06:20,564
Someone's child.

719
01:06:20,647 --> 01:06:22,650
-Stop fucking around. I want a name.
-Someone's kid.

720
01:06:22,733 --> 01:06:24,693
-I wanna know who it was.
-Forget who it was.

721
01:06:25,194 --> 01:06:26,195
What's important right now

722
01:06:26,278 --> 01:06:30,282
is that you understand just
how utterly fucked you are.

723
01:06:37,289 --> 01:06:38,289
Good.

724
01:06:41,919 --> 01:06:43,128
All right.

725
01:06:43,212 --> 01:06:48,300
So, Ryan owed me ten grand for
the drugs your daughter tossed,

726
01:06:49,468 --> 01:06:52,888
and he starts dealing,
trying to earn it back.

727
01:06:53,805 --> 01:06:57,809
But he gets impatient and he cuts the
drugs with fentanyl to stretch it,

728
01:06:57,893 --> 01:07:01,438
and that's fine but he pushes
it too far 'cause he's dumb.

729
01:07:03,315 --> 01:07:08,445
And this kid OD's on the
drugs that Ryan sold him.

730
01:07:10,280 --> 01:07:12,616
And Ryan and Claire come to me
and they're freaking the fuck out,

731
01:07:12,699 --> 01:07:16,203
and so I calm them both down,
and I come up with a plan.

732
01:07:16,703 --> 01:07:18,247
And I gotta be honest.
I did not think

733
01:07:18,330 --> 01:07:20,749
that you were gonna
fucking actually do it,

734
01:07:21,750 --> 01:07:26,588
but Claire said that you would on
account of your unconditional love.

735
01:07:28,382 --> 01:07:29,341
And she was right.

736
01:07:29,424 --> 01:07:34,847
You dumped the body, you got
my money, and here we are.

737
01:07:38,433 --> 01:07:40,018
Does Claire know
you're doing this?

738
01:07:40,102 --> 01:07:41,228
She does.

739
01:07:41,979 --> 01:07:44,064
No. She doesn't.

740
01:07:44,147 --> 01:07:45,774
I'm seizing an opportunity.

741
01:07:46,650 --> 01:07:49,695
You've gone this far. I figure
you'll go a little farther, right?

742
01:07:50,279 --> 01:07:51,864
So what do you want?

743
01:07:51,947 --> 01:07:56,702
Some things have come up, and I need to
leave town for a while, and I would like

744
01:07:56,785 --> 01:07:59,580
-to get paid out before I go.
-I already paid you.

745
01:07:59,663 --> 01:08:01,582
You paid me ten fucking grand.

746
01:08:03,876 --> 01:08:06,336
I want more. Do you not
see what's going on here?

747
01:08:06,837 --> 01:08:09,089
I'm light-years
ahead of you, lady.

748
01:08:09,173 --> 01:08:13,385
Right now, no one's searching for
some fucking missing dope addict

749
01:08:13,468 --> 01:08:16,596
and no one ever will, but
I make one anonymous call,

750
01:08:17,096 --> 01:08:19,475
and all of a sudden, they're
dragging the bottom of that lake,

751
01:08:19,558 --> 01:08:21,350
and then there's
an investigation

752
01:08:21,435 --> 01:08:25,147
and all roads lead back to
Ryan and Claire and to you.

753
01:08:25,229 --> 01:08:26,439
You're fucked.

754
01:08:27,649 --> 01:08:29,109
I don't have any money.

755
01:08:29,193 --> 01:08:31,278
-I am having a hard time...
-Don't fucking say that to me. Don't say

756
01:08:31,361 --> 01:08:33,447
-you don't have any fucking money.
-...I'm having trouble just making...

757
01:08:33,529 --> 01:08:35,240
-Fucking shut up. Shut up.
-...the bills.

758
01:08:36,283 --> 01:08:39,745
You have acres and acres of
land in Chester fucking County.

759
01:08:40,328 --> 01:08:43,582
You have horses and barns
and a fucking house,

760
01:08:43,665 --> 01:08:46,627
so don't fucking sit there and
tell me that you have nothing

761
01:08:46,710 --> 01:08:48,921
'cause you have a
lot, and I want it.

762
01:08:50,796 --> 01:08:51,756
I can't do this.

763
01:08:51,840 --> 01:08:53,675
Come here. Come here.

764
01:08:53,759 --> 01:08:56,011
No. Get off!

765
01:08:58,055 --> 01:09:00,098
-Get off me!
-No!

766
01:09:12,277 --> 01:09:13,278
Get off!

767
01:09:14,196 --> 01:09:16,448
-Get off! Get off!
-Stop.

768
01:09:16,532 --> 01:09:17,866
Stop, stop, stop.

769
01:09:22,328 --> 01:09:24,413
No, no.

770
01:09:24,497 --> 01:09:26,291
No, no.

771
01:09:26,375 --> 01:09:27,667
No.

772
01:09:28,502 --> 01:09:31,839
-No, no. No.
-Look at me. Look at me.

773
01:09:34,424 --> 01:09:35,425
Okay.

774
01:09:45,978 --> 01:09:47,104
There we go.

775
01:09:55,696 --> 01:09:57,030
You're okay.

776
01:09:58,824 --> 01:09:59,825
You're all right.

777
01:10:01,869 --> 01:10:03,078
You're okay.

778
01:11:13,982 --> 01:11:16,443
Wakey-wakey. Jesus
Christ. Get up.

779
01:11:17,528 --> 01:11:20,489
Fuck. I gave you 200 milligrams, and
you're acting like Sleeping Beauty.

780
01:11:20,572 --> 01:11:21,615
Let's go.

781
01:11:23,492 --> 01:11:24,535
Come on.

782
01:11:24,618 --> 01:11:29,623
All right, so I took your phone,
computer, car keys, house keys.

783
01:11:30,290 --> 01:11:32,960
You don't leave this property without
my permission. You understand?

784
01:11:33,043 --> 01:11:35,128
You got two days to pay me.

785
01:11:35,879 --> 01:11:37,172
Where am I sleeping?

786
01:11:40,175 --> 01:11:41,301
Someone live here?

787
01:11:41,802 --> 01:11:44,638
My wife did before
we got together.

788
01:11:53,647 --> 01:11:55,107
What happened to her?

789
01:11:55,190 --> 01:11:56,191
She died.

790
01:11:58,193 --> 01:12:01,238
Tractor backfired, her horse
threw her, and she broke her neck.

791
01:12:03,782 --> 01:12:04,783
That sucks.

792
01:12:07,619 --> 01:12:10,664
Hey. I don't want anyone hanging
around here except me and you.

793
01:12:11,748 --> 01:12:13,333
Make a list of your clients.

794
01:12:13,417 --> 01:12:16,253
I'll send out a text saying
you're not available for lessons.

795
01:12:33,187 --> 01:12:34,188
You're not gonna eat?

796
01:12:36,148 --> 01:12:37,816
I don't have much
of an appetite.

797
01:12:46,074 --> 01:12:47,075
Hey.

798
01:12:47,159 --> 01:12:48,535
Please don't feed him that.

799
01:12:51,371 --> 01:12:52,372
He likes it.

800
01:12:53,373 --> 01:12:54,374
Look at him.

801
01:12:54,458 --> 01:12:55,542
You'll make him sick.

802
01:13:07,012 --> 01:13:08,013
Shit.

803
01:13:57,104 --> 01:13:58,105
Oh, God.

804
01:14:18,792 --> 01:14:21,670
<i>Jesus Christ. I must have
called you 50 fucking times.</i>

805
01:14:21,753 --> 01:14:23,339
<i>Are you trying to give
me a heart attack?</i>

806
01:14:23,422 --> 01:14:26,133
Hey. Old Granderson's barn
fire, how did he get caught?

807
01:14:26,675 --> 01:14:29,845
-<i>What?</i>
-He was arrested. Why?

808
01:14:30,762 --> 01:14:33,140
<i>I don't like where your
head's at right now.</i>

809
01:14:33,682 --> 01:14:35,225
Les, come on. Just
tell me, please.

810
01:14:38,353 --> 01:14:40,856
<i>He used a flare.</i>

811
01:14:41,815 --> 01:14:43,984
<i>He'd researched it, and
I guess he found out</i>

812
01:14:44,067 --> 01:14:47,321
<i>that starting a fire with a flare
would be virtually undetectable.</i>

813
01:14:48,405 --> 01:14:49,865
But he was arrested.

814
01:14:49,948 --> 01:14:52,618
<i>Because he left something
behind. A part of the flare.</i>

815
01:14:53,118 --> 01:14:54,369
<i>I don't remember exactly what,</i>

816
01:14:54,453 --> 01:14:58,165
<i>but when the fire marshal found it,
he knew it was set intentionally.</i>

817
01:14:58,248 --> 01:15:00,167
<i>Why do you wanna
know all this anyway?</i>

818
01:15:02,377 --> 01:15:05,047
<i>Kate, are you sure you're okay?</i>

819
01:15:06,507 --> 01:15:08,091
I'll call you back soon, okay?

820
01:15:17,184 --> 01:15:19,353
That's $100,000 of
insurance on the barn.

821
01:15:21,146 --> 01:15:22,147
If you burn it.

822
01:15:23,482 --> 01:15:24,482
Right.

823
01:15:26,235 --> 01:15:29,613
How exactly do you do that without
these guys knowing you did it?

824
01:15:30,614 --> 01:15:32,950
Hay spontaneously
combusts at 130 degrees.

825
01:15:33,033 --> 01:15:36,912
It happens all the time, but if you
use a flare, then it's undetectable.

826
01:15:40,832 --> 01:15:43,961
How long after you burn it will
it take for me to get my money?

827
01:15:45,546 --> 01:15:49,341
I don't know. I mean, a
couple weeks or a month.

828
01:15:49,424 --> 01:15:50,801
No. No.

829
01:15:50,884 --> 01:15:52,302
Figure out a different plan.

830
01:15:52,386 --> 01:15:53,470
This is what I have.

831
01:15:53,554 --> 01:15:54,972
I've thought about this.

832
01:15:55,055 --> 01:15:58,809
I've thought about it really
carefully, and I promise you

833
01:15:58,892 --> 01:16:01,144
-that you can get your money this way.
-How?

834
01:16:02,229 --> 01:16:05,732
I will be clear across the country
by the time that payout arrives.

835
01:16:08,068 --> 01:16:12,906
I could make you an employee of the
farm, and then send it in installments,

836
01:16:12,990 --> 01:16:16,201
and then I don't think
it'll get flagged that way.

837
01:16:20,247 --> 01:16:21,456
What about the horses?

838
01:16:23,125 --> 01:16:24,209
What about them?

839
01:16:25,419 --> 01:16:26,503
Are they insured too?

840
01:16:27,254 --> 01:16:29,756
Yeah, but this is a
boarding facility,

841
01:16:29,840 --> 01:16:33,594
so not all of the
horses belong to me.

842
01:16:34,845 --> 01:16:36,096
How many do?

843
01:16:37,472 --> 01:16:38,473
Two.

844
01:16:40,434 --> 01:16:42,186
How much are those
two insured for?

845
01:16:43,562 --> 01:16:45,063
25,000 each.

846
01:16:47,399 --> 01:16:48,775
So we burn them too.

847
01:16:50,527 --> 01:16:53,155
And that brings the
payout to 150,000.

848
01:16:56,617 --> 01:16:58,118
-But if we...
-That's good.

849
01:17:00,287 --> 01:17:03,498
-But if we just burn my horses...
-What, are you fucking stupid?

850
01:17:03,582 --> 01:17:06,126
We're not just gonna burn your
horses. We burn all the horses.

851
01:17:06,835 --> 01:17:08,045
Use your head.

852
01:17:13,300 --> 01:17:16,261
-Who's that?
-That's Emma.

853
01:17:16,345 --> 01:17:17,304
She's a client.

854
01:17:17,387 --> 01:17:20,432
What's she doing here? I
thought we canceled her lesson.

855
01:17:20,516 --> 01:17:21,892
We did. I'll get it.

856
01:17:21,975 --> 01:17:23,894
No, no. You stay here.

857
01:17:36,823 --> 01:17:37,950
Afternoon.

858
01:17:39,785 --> 01:17:40,786
It's Emma, right?

859
01:17:42,871 --> 01:17:43,872
Where's Kate?

860
01:17:44,915 --> 01:17:46,458
She woke up with a fever.

861
01:17:48,001 --> 01:17:50,254
Don't worry. I'm taking
real good care of her.

862
01:17:55,092 --> 01:17:57,469
I'm sorry. Who are you exactly?

863
01:17:59,096 --> 01:18:01,890
I'm the new fucking farmhand.

864
01:18:02,975 --> 01:18:04,476
Just started a few days ago.

865
01:18:06,979 --> 01:18:10,774
Okay. I'm just gonna grab some of these
saddle pads for the New Haven show.

866
01:18:10,858 --> 01:18:13,151
-Let me help.
-No. I'm fine. I don't need any help.

867
01:18:13,235 --> 01:18:14,278
I got it.

868
01:18:14,361 --> 01:18:15,737
I said I don't need your help.

869
01:18:18,574 --> 01:18:19,575
All right.

870
01:18:20,909 --> 01:18:22,160
That means you can go.

871
01:18:26,248 --> 01:18:27,708
Can you get out of my space?

872
01:18:39,595 --> 01:18:41,054
Emma's a fucking bitch.

873
01:18:43,432 --> 01:18:45,017
Okay. We'll burn it.

874
01:18:45,976 --> 01:18:46,977
But it's on you.

875
01:18:47,811 --> 01:18:48,812
All of it.

876
01:18:49,313 --> 01:18:52,232
'Cause if shit goes sideways,
I'm nowhere near any of this.

877
01:19:13,879 --> 01:19:17,257
Hey, Dale. Appreciate you fitting
me in on such short notice.

878
01:19:17,341 --> 01:19:18,342
Yeah, you got it.

879
01:19:51,500 --> 01:19:52,668
Is it ready?

880
01:19:55,045 --> 01:19:58,048
Yeah. We'll do it between
2:00 and 3:00 a.m.

881
01:19:58,131 --> 01:19:59,591
Let it burn for a while.

882
01:19:59,675 --> 01:20:05,389
By the time anybody notices and calls
the fire department, it'll be too late.

883
01:20:07,850 --> 01:20:08,851
Cool.

884
01:20:24,825 --> 01:20:26,076
Hey, handsome.

885
01:20:28,537 --> 01:20:29,537
I know.

886
01:20:30,998 --> 01:20:32,666
Everything's gonna be okay.

887
01:20:36,628 --> 01:20:37,796
I know.

888
01:20:45,179 --> 01:20:46,430
You should probably go now.

889
01:20:48,223 --> 01:20:50,017
You know, I think I'm
gonna stick around.

890
01:20:50,851 --> 01:20:52,394
Make sure you go
through with it.

891
01:23:17,915 --> 01:23:21,543
-How you doing? You doing okay?
-Not really. No.

892
01:23:25,088 --> 01:23:26,798
The fire marshal
just informed me

893
01:23:26,882 --> 01:23:30,594
that the blaze was set
intentionally, Ms. Garretson.

894
01:23:33,639 --> 01:23:37,017
It's a wire stand. They're
commonly used in road flares.

895
01:23:39,102 --> 01:23:41,063
He found that at the
point of ignition.

896
01:23:43,565 --> 01:23:45,734
What are you saying?
You think that I did...

897
01:23:49,238 --> 01:23:52,038
You mentioned there was someone living
in the apartment above the barn.

898
01:23:53,492 --> 01:23:55,285
An employee. Jackie Lawson.

899
01:23:55,369 --> 01:23:57,579
Was Jackie home last night?
Was he in the apartment?

900
01:23:57,663 --> 01:23:58,622
His car was there

901
01:23:58,705 --> 01:24:00,124
-when I went to bed.
-What time was that?

902
01:24:00,207 --> 01:24:03,877
-When you went to bed.
-Like 10 p.m. probably.

903
01:24:04,711 --> 01:24:06,088
So when you noticed
the fire outside,

904
01:24:06,171 --> 01:24:08,298
do you remember if Jackie's
car was still there?

905
01:24:10,634 --> 01:24:14,137
It wasn't. And I called him this morning
to let him know what was going on,

906
01:24:14,221 --> 01:24:16,014
but I haven't heard
anything from him.

907
01:24:20,102 --> 01:24:22,646
Ms. Garretson, we found a dead
body inside the apartment.

908
01:24:32,030 --> 01:24:33,740
<i>Do you think it was Jackie?</i>

909
01:24:35,158 --> 01:24:36,201
<i>We don't know.</i>

910
01:24:36,952 --> 01:24:39,288
<i>As you could imagine, it
was very badly burned.</i>

911
01:24:41,206 --> 01:24:43,292
<i>I need you to come down
to the station with me.</i>

912
01:25:16,074 --> 01:25:17,659
Okay. Sorry for the wait.

913
01:25:18,243 --> 01:25:20,370
Good news is we were
able to locate Jackie.

914
01:25:20,996 --> 01:25:22,497
Oh, thank God.

915
01:25:27,544 --> 01:25:29,087
How'd you two meet,
Ms. Garretson?

916
01:25:30,255 --> 01:25:34,176
Jackie and I? Through my daughter,
Claire. He's a friend of hers.

917
01:25:34,259 --> 01:25:37,763
He was looking for a job, and I needed
somebody to help me out in the stables.

918
01:25:41,391 --> 01:25:44,311
It's odd 'cause Jackie claims
he never worked for you.

919
01:25:45,521 --> 01:25:48,815
Never lived in the apartment. In fact,
he says he doesn't even know who you are.

920
01:25:51,109 --> 01:25:52,402
He doesn't know who I am?

921
01:25:52,486 --> 01:25:53,487
But he's...

922
01:25:55,405 --> 01:25:57,658
He's been living on the
farm and working there.

923
01:25:57,741 --> 01:26:01,453
Why would he say that he
doesn't know who I am?

924
01:26:02,412 --> 01:26:03,622
What about clients?

925
01:26:04,122 --> 01:26:06,917
I'd imagine they'd have seen
him hanging around the place.

926
01:26:11,129 --> 01:26:12,840
I canceled all my lessons.

927
01:26:16,635 --> 01:26:17,928
My wife passed away recently.

928
01:26:18,011 --> 01:26:20,430
I've had a really hard time
getting back on my feet.

929
01:26:22,474 --> 01:26:23,475
I'm sorry.

930
01:26:25,602 --> 01:26:27,479
-Emma Hanway.
-What's that?

931
01:26:27,563 --> 01:26:29,314
Emma Hanway is a client.

932
01:26:29,398 --> 01:26:32,943
I texted her to pick
up a saddle pad.

933
01:26:33,026 --> 01:26:35,070
I mean, you... I could
give her your contact

934
01:26:35,153 --> 01:26:37,656
-if you think that would be helpful.
-Please.

935
01:26:43,662 --> 01:26:45,956
Was there anyone with
Jackie that you noticed?

936
01:26:47,624 --> 01:26:50,210
Anyone hanging around?
Going inside the apartment?

937
01:26:51,044 --> 01:26:54,214
I mean, I didn't keep a
really... a close watch on him.

938
01:26:58,177 --> 01:27:00,053
There was one person though.

939
01:27:01,430 --> 01:27:03,640
He introduced
himself to me once.

940
01:27:03,724 --> 01:27:06,393
-Greg.
-G...

941
01:27:08,312 --> 01:27:10,898
Kamiski. Kaminski.
Something like that.

942
01:27:16,278 --> 01:27:17,446
You recognize him?

943
01:27:19,948 --> 01:27:20,949
Nope.

944
01:27:22,576 --> 01:27:23,952
His name is Greg Kaminski.

945
01:27:24,036 --> 01:27:27,206
Medical examiner just confirmed
it through dental records.

946
01:27:29,750 --> 01:27:30,751
Okay.

947
01:27:31,960 --> 01:27:34,630
His body was found out at
Echo Valley this morning.

948
01:27:35,964 --> 01:27:37,841
Inside that apartment
above the barn.

949
01:27:40,636 --> 01:27:44,056
All right. Well, I already told
you I wasn't staying at that farm.

950
01:27:44,139 --> 01:27:46,016
-I don't know this fucking...
-Jackie, I know you been working

951
01:27:46,099 --> 01:27:48,602
on the farm. I got the
bank statement to prove it.

952
01:27:50,687 --> 01:27:51,772
Bank statement?

953
01:27:51,855 --> 01:27:55,692
$2,500 wired to your bank
account from Ms. Garretson's.

954
01:27:57,194 --> 01:27:58,904
In addition, a client
of Ms. Garretson's

955
01:27:58,987 --> 01:28:00,781
confirmed that she saw
you at the property.

956
01:28:06,620 --> 01:28:09,581
All right. Let's just
fucking rewind, okay?

957
01:28:09,665 --> 01:28:12,084
Let's rewind and
just go from the top.

958
01:28:12,167 --> 01:28:14,170
I'm gonna tell you exactly
what happened, all right?

959
01:28:14,253 --> 01:28:17,256
I'm going to tell you
what actually happened.

960
01:28:23,971 --> 01:28:25,138
<i>Jesus Christ.</i>

961
01:28:25,764 --> 01:28:28,893
<i>I must have called you 50 fucking times.
Are you trying to give me a heart attack?</i>

962
01:28:28,976 --> 01:28:31,895
Hey. Old Granderson's barn
fire, how did he get caught?

963
01:28:31,979 --> 01:28:34,648
<i>'Cause he left something
behind. A part of the flare.</i>

964
01:28:35,607 --> 01:28:37,609
<i>Why do you want to
know all this anyway?</i>

965
01:28:39,820 --> 01:28:41,530
<i>I'll call you back soon, okay?</i>

966
01:28:52,624 --> 01:28:53,624
Okay.

967
01:29:12,686 --> 01:29:13,937
There it is. Stop.

968
01:30:30,055 --> 01:30:31,515
He's gone.

969
01:30:54,830 --> 01:30:55,831
We gotta leave.

970
01:31:08,802 --> 01:31:09,802
It's okay.

971
01:31:13,182 --> 01:31:14,182
Come on.

972
01:31:22,858 --> 01:31:23,984
Good boy. Go, go!

973
01:31:52,930 --> 01:31:54,306
You guys are being played.

974
01:31:54,389 --> 01:31:56,642
We're all being fucking
played right now by her.

975
01:31:58,018 --> 01:31:59,645
You know, just so I'm clear...

976
01:32:00,479 --> 01:32:02,272
Your story is that
Kate's daughter,

977
01:32:02,356 --> 01:32:04,816
and her daughter's boyfriend
killed Greg Kaminski

978
01:32:04,900 --> 01:32:06,818
and had Kate dump the
body at Marsh Creek Lake.

979
01:32:06,902 --> 01:32:09,112
-I know how it sounds.
-I wasn't finished.

980
01:32:09,196 --> 01:32:12,616
Then she set the fire using
flares that you purchased

981
01:32:12,699 --> 01:32:15,786
from the Quick Star gas
station one mile from her farm.

982
01:32:18,622 --> 01:32:20,082
Do you wanna know what I think?

983
01:32:21,416 --> 01:32:23,710
I think Greg Kaminski's
a known drug abuser.

984
01:32:23,794 --> 01:32:24,962
I think you were his dealer.

985
01:32:25,462 --> 01:32:26,964
I think something happened
inside the apartment.

986
01:32:27,047 --> 01:32:29,091
-No! Fucking no.
-I think something happened inside...

987
01:32:29,174 --> 01:32:31,343
-Don't fucking pin this shit on me!
-Relax, Jackie.

988
01:32:31,426 --> 01:32:32,803
-Don't fucking...
-Put your arm down. Sit down.

989
01:32:32,886 --> 01:32:34,221
You don't understand.
Don't fucking touch me.

990
01:32:34,304 --> 01:32:35,473
-Get back there.
-Don't you fucking...

991
01:32:35,556 --> 01:32:36,640
-Sit down!
-Don't fucking touch me.

992
01:32:36,723 --> 01:32:37,724
Don't...

993
01:33:48,795 --> 01:33:49,838
It's all right.

994
01:33:52,549 --> 01:33:54,843
It's all over now.

995
01:33:58,805 --> 01:34:00,891
Yeah, yeah. I hear
you, jerk off.

996
01:35:03,745 --> 01:35:04,955
-Thank you.
-Yeah.

997
01:35:05,038 --> 01:35:07,165
-Hey, Randy.
-Hey, Kate.

998
01:35:07,249 --> 01:35:09,168
-How's it going?
-So far so good.

999
01:35:09,877 --> 01:35:12,045
I'll have this cleanup done
by the end of the week.

1000
01:35:12,546 --> 01:35:15,346
Then with a little bit of luck, we'll
be under roof before winter hits.

1001
01:35:15,757 --> 01:35:17,384
-That's great. Thanks.
-Yeah.

1002
01:35:17,467 --> 01:35:19,344
Hey, Randy.
Generator's backed in.

1003
01:35:20,470 --> 01:35:21,763
I gotta go play "Mom."

1004
01:35:52,377 --> 01:35:54,129
Okay, go to your working trot.

1005
01:35:56,006 --> 01:35:58,175
Stay in two-point
and ask him to walk.

1006
01:35:59,718 --> 01:36:01,094
Little slower.

1007
01:36:04,056 --> 01:36:05,224
There you go.

1008
01:36:46,682 --> 01:36:47,683
<i>Hey, it's me.</i>

1009
01:36:47,766 --> 01:36:49,017
<i>We're on our way home now.</i>

1010
01:36:49,101 --> 01:36:51,186
<i>I let Claire know
that as a punishment,</i>

1011
01:36:51,270 --> 01:36:53,772
<i>she'll be mucking horse shit
for the next two months.</i>

1012
01:36:53,856 --> 01:36:56,692
<i>-Stop, Patty.
-She wants to tell you something.</i>

1013
01:36:56,775 --> 01:37:00,028
<i>Hi, Mom. I'm sorry for being
such a constant fuckup.</i>

1014
01:37:00,112 --> 01:37:02,155
<i>-Hey. We're past that now.
-And...</i>

1015
01:37:03,073 --> 01:37:04,950
<i>And I just love you, you know.</i>

1016
01:37:05,033 --> 01:37:08,245
<i>Did you hear that? She loves
you like crazy and I do too.</i>

1017
01:37:08,328 --> 01:37:11,081
<i>The snow's eased up
and we'll be home soon.</i>
