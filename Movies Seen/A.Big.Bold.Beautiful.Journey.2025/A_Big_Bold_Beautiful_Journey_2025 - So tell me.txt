So tell me.

Why are you single?

You really wanna know?

Yeah.

It's because I cheat.

Even when I don't want to cheat,
I'll end up cheating.

Even when the person
I'm with is perfect, I'll cheat.

Okay.

It makes me feel like
one half of me is always single

and doesn't have to give a shit
about anyone else but myself,

and so then that half...

cheats and...

gets caught.

And then all of me is single,

and that's what I'd rather be
in the first place.

Not the answer I expected.

And why are you single?

Oh...

I suppose I haven't
met the right one yet.

David, you've probably
met the right one,

like, a hundred times already.

Mmm, I wish that was true
even once, Sarah, but...

That's such
a bullshit answer.

I gave you honest fucking truth.

And you're going to give me,

"I haven't met
the right one yet."

Just because
you don't like the answer

doesn't mean
it's a bullshit answer.

You've probably given
the "I cheat" speech

a thousand times.

And I betcha anything it makes
guys want you even more.

Yeah? Any truth to that?

Sounded a little bit rehearsed.

Kind of like your top
of the lighthouse bullshit?

"The most beautiful places

"make you feel the most alone."

Oh, that's a pretty good me,
actually. I'm flattered.
