1
00:01:08,666 --> 00:01:10,412
Oh man...

2
00:01:22,986 --> 00:01:24,748
I'll be up in a bit.

3
00:01:24,749 --> 00:01:26,249
You better.

4
00:01:58,395 --> 00:01:59,696
Larry?

5
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:04,830
What?

6
00:02:06,434 --> 00:02:07,873
That.

7
00:02:09,678 --> 00:02:11,887
What's that box
doing in our bedroom?

8
00:02:12,188 --> 00:02:12,688
Uh... I...

9
00:02:12,690 --> 00:02:15,620
I don't know, maybe
one of the crew left it.

10
00:02:17,123 --> 00:02:19,633
- Why'd they do that?
- I don't know.

11
00:02:21,438 --> 00:02:22,939
What is it?

12
00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:25,323
A card,
"FOR THE COLLECTION"

13
00:02:29,031 --> 00:02:30,527
Don't open it.

14
00:02:32,030 --> 00:02:33,066
No!

15
00:02:41,882 --> 00:02:44,334
Jesus...
Oh God!

16
00:05:57,971 --> 00:05:59,547
Is everything alright?

17
00:06:00,048 --> 00:06:02,685
Uh... just about as good as new.

18
00:06:02,686 --> 00:06:03,987
Oh yeah, Arkin?

19
00:06:04,489 --> 00:06:07,715
After you look at the door upstairs, could
you get the last of the window bars up today?

20
00:06:07,915 --> 00:06:09,375
Yeah, not a problem, sir.

21
00:06:10,077 --> 00:06:11,819
I know we're in
middle of nowhere, but...

22
00:06:12,222 --> 00:06:14,754
Vicky still insists on Victorian decor.

23
00:07:00,218 --> 00:07:02,360
CHASE JEWELLERS
MICHAEL CHASE - PRESIDENT

24
00:07:13,476 --> 00:07:16,104
What shall I call you?

25
00:07:18,108 --> 00:07:19,924
How about Jill?

26
00:07:26,334 --> 00:07:27,798
Bye, Jill.

27
00:07:28,799 --> 00:07:29,827
Hey!

28
00:07:30,727 --> 00:07:32,350
I'm a mermaid.

29
00:07:32,552 --> 00:07:33,626
Okay.

30
00:07:33,661 --> 00:07:35,985
I'm having a tea party,
Mr. Arkin.

31
00:07:36,287 --> 00:07:39,131
- Oh well...
- Would you care to join us?

32
00:07:41,836 --> 00:07:43,081
Sure.

33
00:08:01,912 --> 00:08:04,378
It's... it's very good.

34
00:08:04,979 --> 00:08:06,551
He made the tea.

35
00:08:07,454 --> 00:08:09,610
Well, it's very good, sir.

36
00:08:11,315 --> 00:08:13,113
You have a very nice room,
Hannah.

37
00:08:13,214 --> 00:08:14,658
This isn't my room.

38
00:08:14,659 --> 00:08:16,323
- No?
- I'm a mermaid.

39
00:08:16,524 --> 00:08:17,422
Okay.

40
00:08:17,423 --> 00:08:19,944
Mermaids sleep in caves,
not rooms.

41
00:08:22,607 --> 00:08:24,474
Can I ask you something?

42
00:08:25,776 --> 00:08:28,715
If you were to really
want a present.

43
00:08:29,216 --> 00:08:31,399
Something really special.

44
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:33,000
What would it be?

45
00:08:33,501 --> 00:08:34,950
A baskin bear.

46
00:08:37,756 --> 00:08:40,767
Where would you get
a... baskin bear at?

47
00:08:40,868 --> 00:08:42,436
Toy store.

48
00:08:42,736 --> 00:08:44,245
Of course.

49
00:08:44,749 --> 00:08:47,095
Whoa! Excuse me!

50
00:08:47,697 --> 00:08:50,746
- Is everything alright in here?
- Yeah um, she...

51
00:08:52,650 --> 00:08:56,775
Hannah just uh... invited me
to her tea party.

52
00:08:56,858 --> 00:08:58,029
Is that right?

53
00:08:58,230 --> 00:08:59,768
I'm sorry, sir.

54
00:09:00,570 --> 00:09:03,254
I have one about her age.
A daughter.

55
00:09:03,656 --> 00:09:04,953
Name's Cindy.

56
00:09:05,454 --> 00:09:06,854
Oh...

57
00:09:06,858 --> 00:09:09,984
- Okay well uh...
- Well, I got your door working.

58
00:09:10,986 --> 00:09:12,220
Well, thanks.

59
00:09:12,221 --> 00:09:14,494
Thank you for coming,
Mr. Arkin.

60
00:10:28,249 --> 00:10:29,386
Hey!

61
00:10:29,387 --> 00:10:31,387
There's a wasp nest over there.

62
00:10:33,789 --> 00:10:37,268
There's a wasp nest,
by the... by the greenhouse.

63
00:10:58,396 --> 00:10:59,688
Hey.

64
00:11:00,592 --> 00:11:02,139
Let me bum a drag.

65
00:11:02,340 --> 00:11:04,679
Sorry, I'm not adding
to your... delinquency.

66
00:11:04,780 --> 00:11:06,580
What are you, a narc?

67
00:11:06,582 --> 00:11:08,116
Give me a drag.

68
00:11:15,626 --> 00:11:17,183
Arkin, right?

69
00:11:17,384 --> 00:11:18,484
Mm hmm.

70
00:11:18,585 --> 00:11:20,236
What kind of name is
Arkin, anyway?

71
00:11:20,337 --> 00:11:23,912
It's a first name.
What kind of name is Jill?

72
00:11:24,214 --> 00:11:25,766
It's my grandmother's name.

73
00:11:25,867 --> 00:11:28,790
She was the first female
Attorney General in the State.

74
00:11:30,594 --> 00:11:32,593
You're about to hear a fight.

75
00:11:32,999 --> 00:11:34,300
You done somethin'?

76
00:11:35,501 --> 00:11:38,741
Yeah, but don't freak.
It's just a show.

77
00:11:38,742 --> 00:11:40,814
You better gimme
that back then.

78
00:11:40,815 --> 00:11:43,463
I wouldn't wanna ruin
your performance.

79
00:11:46,169 --> 00:11:48,145
Later, Arkin.

80
00:12:14,181 --> 00:12:15,784
Nice try.

81
00:12:17,385 --> 00:12:18,885
I told you mom,
I don't wanna go.

82
00:12:19,189 --> 00:12:20,216
You can't do this to me.

83
00:12:20,217 --> 00:12:22,517
All of my friends are
staying here. I cannot go!

84
00:12:22,617 --> 00:12:24,176
It's not an option!

85
00:12:24,377 --> 00:12:25,877
You're going.

86
00:12:27,278 --> 00:12:30,013
I'm not going on a
family vacation with you!

87
00:12:33,421 --> 00:12:34,822
Arkin.

88
00:12:35,723 --> 00:12:37,994
- For the week.
- Thank you.

89
00:12:38,095 --> 00:12:39,663
There is a little bit of extra there.

90
00:12:39,664 --> 00:12:41,027
Oh, no, sir,
I can't take extra.

91
00:12:41,028 --> 00:12:42,885
No no, it's... it's for the
little one.

92
00:12:42,886 --> 00:12:44,486
I know how tough it can be.

93
00:12:45,784 --> 00:12:47,452
Thank you.
Appreciate it.

94
00:12:47,553 --> 00:12:49,155
You earned it.

95
00:12:49,156 --> 00:12:51,980
Listen, spend as much time as
you can with them when they're young.

96
00:12:52,381 --> 00:12:55,852
Something happens around age 13
and it get's kind of rough for awhile.

97
00:12:55,954 --> 00:12:58,987
What I understand?
Eventually they come back around.

98
00:12:59,788 --> 00:13:02,608
Anyway, see you in
a couple of weeks.

99
00:13:03,311 --> 00:13:05,109
Have a safe trip!

100
00:13:35,150 --> 00:13:36,552
What you doing there,
baby girl?

101
00:13:36,653 --> 00:13:37,556
Daddy!

102
00:13:37,557 --> 00:13:40,749
Shh... keep quiet for just a sec.

103
00:13:41,952 --> 00:13:44,134
I've got someone who
wants to meet you.

104
00:13:44,135 --> 00:13:45,536
Who?

105
00:13:48,541 --> 00:13:51,228
He says you have
to close your eyes.

106
00:13:56,938 --> 00:13:59,250
Alright, go ahead and
open them.

107
00:14:03,056 --> 00:14:04,641
Do I get to keep him?

108
00:14:04,642 --> 00:14:06,713
Of course you get to
keep him.

109
00:14:07,914 --> 00:14:09,558
Do you have it?

110
00:14:10,159 --> 00:14:11,259
Whoa.

111
00:14:14,168 --> 00:14:15,620
What is that?

112
00:14:16,022 --> 00:14:17,574
Daddy got him for me.

113
00:14:18,176 --> 00:14:19,900
God damn it.

114
00:14:21,703 --> 00:14:24,472
- Thank you Daddy.
- You're welcome, Cindy.

115
00:14:32,584 --> 00:14:34,645
Hey!

116
00:14:39,753 --> 00:14:41,372
You're supposed to
come by 6 hours ago.

117
00:14:41,473 --> 00:14:44,085
Yeah, so I just got a bit
tied up at work, you know?

118
00:14:44,187 --> 00:14:46,329
Do you or don't you
have the money?

119
00:14:52,036 --> 00:14:54,687
Look, it's not as much
as I said, but...

120
00:14:54,787 --> 00:14:56,119
it's something.

121
00:14:58,724 --> 00:14:59,810
What is this?

122
00:14:59,913 --> 00:15:01,928
You promised you'd
get it by tonight.

123
00:15:02,129 --> 00:15:03,231
I know,

124
00:15:03,332 --> 00:15:06,191
but these jobs don't
just happen overnight.

125
00:15:06,192 --> 00:15:08,672
- I have to have it today.
- Why today?

126
00:15:08,973 --> 00:15:10,627
Because the people
I owe want it.

127
00:15:10,828 --> 00:15:14,018
So why don't you let me talk
to the people that you owe?

128
00:15:14,321 --> 00:15:15,968
They're loansharks, Arkin.

129
00:15:16,169 --> 00:15:18,769
It's due. That's all there is to it.

130
00:15:22,377 --> 00:15:25,237
- I'm leaving tonight.
- Where're you gonna go?

131
00:15:25,338 --> 00:15:28,168
You gonna go to your Mom's?
Or your sister's?

132
00:15:28,669 --> 00:15:31,523
And all this shit, what're you gonna do?
You gonna just disappear?

133
00:15:31,623 --> 00:15:33,382
They're gonna chase you!

134
00:15:33,684 --> 00:15:37,236
Look, I'm gonna get you
the money, alright?

135
00:15:37,436 --> 00:15:38,794
No, it's too late.

136
00:15:38,795 --> 00:15:40,695
No baby, come here.

137
00:15:40,696 --> 00:15:42,903
Just give me until midnight,
alright?

138
00:15:48,104 --> 00:15:49,504
Midnight.

139
00:16:20,548 --> 00:16:23,081
- Hello?
- Found what we're looking for.

140
00:16:23,082 --> 00:16:25,050
I'm going in and I
gotta get paid tonight.

141
00:16:25,051 --> 00:16:26,416
No way. On whose...

142
00:16:26,451 --> 00:16:28,355
I'm coming over right now.

143
00:17:35,047 --> 00:17:38,114
You would've grown it to
a skin there, kiddo.

144
00:17:41,618 --> 00:17:44,882
Now you've been casing
that family's house for months...

145
00:17:45,482 --> 00:17:48,136
And now that you've found
the jewel broker's safe...

146
00:17:48,238 --> 00:17:50,039
You go to come in here.

147
00:17:50,140 --> 00:17:51,705
With demands.

148
00:17:51,706 --> 00:17:53,406
We settle tonight.

149
00:17:54,608 --> 00:17:58,611
50% take.
The family is out of town.

150
00:17:58,811 --> 00:18:00,626
The stone is inside,

151
00:18:00,727 --> 00:18:02,307
and I need to get
paid tonight.

152
00:18:02,309 --> 00:18:04,280
We got a routine.

153
00:18:05,383 --> 00:18:08,520
I pick the jobs.
You pick the locks.

154
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:11,084
We pick up the prize together.

155
00:18:11,185 --> 00:18:12,785
That's the routine.

156
00:18:13,288 --> 00:18:15,397
You don't change routine.

157
00:18:15,596 --> 00:18:16,775
That's when mistakes happen.

158
00:18:16,876 --> 00:18:18,893
Tonight. Midnight.

159
00:18:19,093 --> 00:18:20,473
No can do.

160
00:18:20,474 --> 00:18:23,028
I guess I'll find
somebody that will.

161
00:18:24,532 --> 00:18:26,119
I run a...

162
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:28,120
smooth operation
out here.

163
00:18:28,719 --> 00:18:30,438
You helped me on
the inside.

164
00:18:30,439 --> 00:18:31,741
You did.

165
00:18:32,243 --> 00:18:33,903
But I never agreed
to your terms.

166
00:18:33,904 --> 00:18:36,704
Taking my help means
you did motherfucker!

167
00:18:37,504 --> 00:18:41,009
You don't come up here all
hopped up in your macho bullshit!

168
00:18:41,110 --> 00:18:44,760
You need to be thinkin'
about that woman of yours,

169
00:18:45,462 --> 00:18:47,726
and that little pretty
girl of yours.

170
00:18:48,533 --> 00:18:51,480
Now...

171
00:18:51,781 --> 00:18:54,181
What was that
request of yours?

172
00:18:56,286 --> 00:19:00,014
We settle tonight.
50% take.

173
00:19:01,718 --> 00:19:03,874
You don't like
your fingers do you?

174
00:19:03,975 --> 00:19:05,375
Huh motherfucker?

175
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:09,463
I am the only guy that you
know that can get into that safe.

176
00:19:09,464 --> 00:19:12,075
So you got a better option
than me? Then roll it out!

177
00:19:20,276 --> 00:19:21,676
50.

178
00:19:28,551 --> 00:19:30,737
40. You take it or leave it.

179
00:19:32,741 --> 00:19:34,770
I guess I'll see ya
later tonight then.

180
00:27:17,114 --> 00:27:19,168
"Just give me until midnight."

181
00:27:19,569 --> 00:27:21,169
"Midnight."

182
00:27:43,803 --> 00:27:55,691
Let go of me!
Please leave me alone!

183
00:28:23,171 --> 00:28:24,639
You!

184
00:28:25,241 --> 00:28:27,480
Why are you doing this?

185
00:28:28,483 --> 00:28:31,152
Why are you doing this?

186
00:28:31,153 --> 00:28:32,553
You son of a bitch...

187
00:28:34,360 --> 00:28:36,317
You son of a bitch!

188
00:29:24,728 --> 00:29:26,361
Shit...

189
00:35:55,573 --> 00:35:58,043
Just stop! Stop!
Shh...

190
00:35:58,244 --> 00:36:01,344
Shut the fuck up!
I'm tryin' to fuckin' help you.

191
00:36:05,645 --> 00:36:07,145
Michael, listen...

192
00:36:07,152 --> 00:36:10,215
I have nothing to do with this.
You gotta believe me, okay?

193
00:36:10,818 --> 00:36:13,185
There were... there were
tools down here right?

194
00:36:13,186 --> 00:36:16,828
- Where were they?
- I don't know, he took 'em.

195
00:36:16,863 --> 00:36:18,815
- Oh God!
- Shh! Shh!

196
00:36:21,118 --> 00:36:25,008
My wife... my wife...
how... my wife...

197
00:36:25,009 --> 00:36:26,617
Where... where's your wife?

198
00:36:26,618 --> 00:36:28,536
She's in there.

199
00:36:30,341 --> 00:36:31,662
Where's Jill and Hannah?

200
00:36:31,763 --> 00:36:33,562
Jill left before he got here.

201
00:36:33,629 --> 00:36:34,712
And Hannah is she in here?

202
00:36:34,713 --> 00:36:36,013
I don't know.

203
00:36:36,015 --> 00:36:39,416
God, I don't know...
I don't...

204
00:36:40,619 --> 00:36:45,266
Okay, I'm gonna find 'em.
I'll find them. Calm down.

205
00:36:46,570 --> 00:36:48,253
My gun...

206
00:36:48,254 --> 00:36:50,576
It's the only way,
you have get my handgun.

207
00:36:50,876 --> 00:36:53,353
You got a gun?
Where is your gun?

208
00:36:53,454 --> 00:36:56,428
It's in the safe in my bedroom.

209
00:36:56,530 --> 00:36:58,333
Behind the mirror.

210
00:36:59,036 --> 00:37:00,695
Bullets are in the bottom drawer.

211
00:37:00,696 --> 00:37:02,899
What's the combination?

212
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:06,947
15... 24... 7.

213
00:37:06,948 --> 00:37:10,247
15-24-7, all right.
Just stay quiet.

214
00:37:10,248 --> 00:37:12,749
I'm gonna get you
out of here.

215
00:37:14,421 --> 00:37:15,674
Oh God!

216
00:37:35,704 --> 00:37:38,517
Hey! Hey! I'm here to
help you. It's ok. Shh...

217
00:37:39,919 --> 00:37:42,619
We're taking that
gag off okay?

218
00:37:50,631 --> 00:37:52,311
Yeah... yeah...

219
00:37:53,410 --> 00:37:55,569
Can you get this off my eyes?

220
00:37:58,875 --> 00:38:01,043
Please...

221
00:38:02,847 --> 00:38:07,378
Nah... Nah... listen,
I can't. I can't.

222
00:38:07,379 --> 00:38:10,188
- Why?
- I can't take that off.

223
00:38:10,189 --> 00:38:13,119
Have you seen Hannah?
Where's my baby?

224
00:38:13,120 --> 00:38:15,192
I didn't see her. I don't
think she's in the house.

225
00:38:15,893 --> 00:38:19,192
No no... she's hiding.
He hasn't got to her yet.

226
00:38:19,193 --> 00:38:20,624
You have to find her.

227
00:38:20,625 --> 00:38:23,164
Okay, okay I will.
I'll keep looking.

228
00:38:23,165 --> 00:38:24,667
- My baby...
- Shh!

229
00:38:24,668 --> 00:38:27,374
Victoria, I will.
I'll get her, okay?

230
00:38:27,375 --> 00:38:30,600
But listen, I need you to do
something for me, okay?

231
00:38:30,802 --> 00:38:34,655
I need you to help me.
I'm gonna need you to scream.

232
00:38:34,656 --> 00:38:35,958
Oh no... no no...

233
00:38:35,959 --> 00:38:39,299
Listen, I just need a distraction
so I can get up there.

234
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:41,500
If I get up there,
I can find Hannah.

235
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:44,483
But I need to get upstairs.

236
00:38:44,906 --> 00:38:49,607
When he comes down here, stop
screaming so he doesn't hurt you, alright?

237
00:38:49,708 --> 00:38:51,709
Can you do that?

238
00:38:51,810 --> 00:38:53,431
It's okay.

239
00:38:53,432 --> 00:38:56,314
I'm gonna get you out of
here but I need your help.

240
00:38:56,413 --> 00:38:58,826
I need to get up there.

241
00:38:58,829 --> 00:39:00,576
- Okay?
- Okay...

242
00:39:02,981 --> 00:39:05,756
Give me just a second,
and then you start screamin'.

243
00:39:05,757 --> 00:39:09,273
- I promise you I'll be back.
- Okay...

244
00:40:56,891 --> 00:40:58,269
No!

245
00:41:52,047 --> 00:41:55,470
There's no fuckin' bullets...
Where's the fucking bullets?

246
00:42:20,810 --> 00:42:22,236
Hannah?

247
00:42:26,843 --> 00:42:28,840
Hannah is that you?

248
00:42:31,142 --> 00:42:32,888
Hannah?

249
00:42:36,997 --> 00:42:39,157
Hannah is that you?

250
00:43:18,422 --> 00:43:20,040
Hannah?

251
00:43:25,741 --> 00:43:28,341
- Get out!
- Who the hell are you?

252
00:43:29,747 --> 00:43:31,930
Larry Horn.

253
00:43:31,931 --> 00:43:33,484
Jesus...

254
00:43:34,489 --> 00:43:36,373
No... no...

255
00:43:36,973 --> 00:43:39,962
What does this guy want?
What... what does he want?

256
00:43:40,265 --> 00:43:42,236
He collects people...

257
00:43:42,239 --> 00:43:44,799
No no, he's killing people.
He's killing them.

258
00:43:44,898 --> 00:43:49,548
No no no, he only kills people
that he doesn't want.

259
00:43:49,549 --> 00:43:51,237
The rest he takes.
He takes them.

260
00:43:51,238 --> 00:43:52,991
Then why are you here?

261
00:43:53,290 --> 00:43:55,594
I'm the bait.

262
00:43:57,696 --> 00:44:01,372
If you're not chosen, you'll
never leave this house alive!

263
00:44:01,373 --> 00:44:05,101
He only takes one!
He only takes one... no!

264
00:44:09,048 --> 00:44:11,749
No!
No!

265
00:47:24,084 --> 00:47:25,405
Hey, it's me...

266
00:47:25,406 --> 00:47:26,475
Come here.

267
00:47:26,510 --> 00:47:28,255
Let's get this off you.

268
00:47:28,356 --> 00:47:30,756
what's that

269
00:47:37,370 --> 00:47:40,474
I couldn't find Hannah anywhere.
I don't think she's in the house.

270
00:47:40,475 --> 00:47:42,243
She has to be here.

271
00:47:42,278 --> 00:47:45,186
I looked everywhere.
I didn't see her.

272
00:47:46,690 --> 00:47:49,607
- Where's Michael?
- He's okay. He's fine.

273
00:47:49,608 --> 00:47:52,841
After I get you out of here,
I'm gonna get him out of here okay?

274
00:47:53,842 --> 00:47:56,888
I can't do this.
I can't do this.

275
00:47:57,089 --> 00:47:59,560
I gotta get outta here...
I gotta get outta here!

276
00:47:59,763 --> 00:48:03,469
Please, one second...
One second...

277
00:48:11,378 --> 00:48:16,303
A robbery... I've prepared myself
for that but not this... not this!

278
00:48:16,304 --> 00:48:17,569
I don't wanna die!

279
00:48:17,570 --> 00:48:19,080
You're not gonna die!

280
00:48:19,081 --> 00:48:21,558
Shh... shh... You're not
gonna die. Shh... shh...

281
00:48:21,661 --> 00:48:25,154
- Hold still.
- And Hannah, gonna get Hannah.

282
00:48:25,155 --> 00:48:26,432
And Hannah too.

283
00:48:27,232 --> 00:48:29,201
Now listen, when we get
outta here,

284
00:48:29,202 --> 00:48:31,402
I'm gonna hide you okay?

285
00:48:31,502 --> 00:48:33,728
You can't say a word, okay?

286
00:48:33,829 --> 00:48:38,438
And when we go out of here,
you keep your eyes on my back.

287
00:48:38,440 --> 00:48:41,421
Alright? Keep your eyes
on my back. Come on...

288
00:51:45,980 --> 00:51:47,714
Why didn't you listen to me!

289
00:51:47,815 --> 00:51:49,815
I told you to stay with me!

290
00:52:22,160 --> 00:52:23,911
Shit.

291
00:52:44,541 --> 00:52:46,837
Easy... you'll wake the neighbors.

292
00:52:46,840 --> 00:52:48,869
What neighbors?

293
00:52:50,370 --> 00:52:51,370
Hey.

294
00:52:52,171 --> 00:52:53,871
Hey!

295
00:52:54,177 --> 00:52:56,140
Jill, stop!

296
00:53:03,852 --> 00:53:05,616
Jill!

297
00:53:16,632 --> 00:53:18,393
Let's do it right here.

298
00:53:18,495 --> 00:53:21,628
I'm not doing it on
my front porch.

299
00:53:27,537 --> 00:53:28,807
Damn it.

300
00:53:28,908 --> 00:53:30,309
What?

301
00:53:31,411 --> 00:53:34,423
I think my mom
changed the locks on me.

302
00:53:49,369 --> 00:53:51,033
You sure they're not here?

303
00:53:51,235 --> 00:53:52,577
Yeah, positive.

304
00:53:53,279 --> 00:53:54,659
Let's go.

305
00:54:39,021 --> 00:54:40,988
Definitely not typical.

306
00:54:42,491 --> 00:54:44,024
Who cares?

307
00:55:01,950 --> 00:55:03,261
I don't think so.

308
00:55:03,563 --> 00:55:05,339
Where do think
you're going?

309
00:55:25,770 --> 00:55:28,187
I really think we
should do it right.

310
00:55:30,789 --> 00:55:32,169
Oh...

311
00:58:19,244 --> 00:58:21,578
911, please state
your emergency.

312
00:59:05,941 --> 00:59:07,384
Oh God no.

313
00:59:09,487 --> 00:59:11,185
Oh my God!

314
00:59:44,534 --> 00:59:45,758
Hey! Hey!

315
00:59:45,759 --> 00:59:47,559
Don't make a sound!
It's me!

316
00:59:48,660 --> 00:59:50,808
What are you doing here?

317
00:59:50,843 --> 00:59:52,272
I'm gonna get you out of here.

318
00:59:52,273 --> 00:59:55,673
- Where is my family?
- Jill, you gotta be quiet!

319
00:59:55,675 --> 00:59:58,058
Look at me!
You gotta be quiet!

320
00:59:58,459 --> 01:00:00,059
Come on...

321
01:00:01,065 --> 01:00:03,075
No... no...

322
01:00:03,876 --> 01:00:05,176
No!

323
01:00:16,477 --> 01:00:18,477
Jill! Don't!

324
01:00:59,756 --> 01:01:01,818
Help me. Help me please!

325
01:01:04,220 --> 01:01:06,963
You gotta push...
Help me here!

326
01:01:07,764 --> 01:01:09,164
Help me...

327
01:01:10,570 --> 01:01:13,587
- Help me... please help me.
- You gotta help me push up!

328
01:01:17,160 --> 01:01:20,852
No... no... no! Please don't leave me!

329
01:01:20,853 --> 01:01:22,653
No... no... please...

330
01:01:23,760 --> 01:01:27,103
No! No! Please! Please!
Please come back!

331
01:01:28,306 --> 01:01:30,034
- I'm sorry...
- Please come back!

332
01:01:30,336 --> 01:01:32,175
Please don't go!

333
01:02:39,771 --> 01:02:40,862
Run... run little girl.

334
01:02:40,863 --> 01:02:43,263
Run!

335
01:03:34,534 --> 01:03:35,981
Where the hell were you?

336
01:03:36,083 --> 01:03:38,723
Please, don't let
the man get me.

337
01:03:40,028 --> 01:03:43,333
We're gonna lose him now ok?
Now, would you listen to me?

338
01:03:43,635 --> 01:03:45,857
- You gotta stay off the floor ok?
- I can do that.

339
01:03:45,859 --> 01:03:48,608
- Alright, you can do that?
- Yeah... yeah.

340
01:04:27,964 --> 01:04:29,498
Now!

341
01:05:05,351 --> 01:05:06,734
Damn it!

342
01:05:07,335 --> 01:05:09,236
Damn! Fuck!

343
01:05:31,770 --> 01:05:33,281
The laundry chute!

344
01:05:34,785 --> 01:05:36,791
Does it go all the way down?

345
01:05:37,594 --> 01:05:39,688
I want you to get outta the way ok?
I'm coming right behind you.

346
01:09:00,869 --> 01:09:03,083
Just let her go.

347
01:09:04,088 --> 01:09:05,535
You got her father.

348
01:09:06,037 --> 01:09:08,825
You got me.
Just let her go.

349
01:09:09,428 --> 01:09:11,974
You never would've
found her anyway.

350
01:10:09,156 --> 01:10:10,735
Stay away!

351
01:10:18,645 --> 01:10:20,311
Where are you going?

352
01:10:21,113 --> 01:10:23,602
Is that all you got?
You little bitch!

353
01:10:28,212 --> 01:10:30,840
Is that all you got?
You fucking faggot!

354
01:10:33,746 --> 01:10:37,508
Is that all you got?
You little fucking faggot bitch!

355
01:10:42,116 --> 01:10:45,646
Come here you faggot!
I'm gonna eat your fucking heart!

356
01:10:50,356 --> 01:10:51,754
Fuck you!

357
01:11:19,197 --> 01:11:20,841
Get it off!
Get it off!

358
01:11:20,842 --> 01:11:22,942
Get it off me!

359
01:11:28,452 --> 01:11:30,113
Get away!

360
01:11:34,920 --> 01:11:39,782
Dispatch, this is unit 316
responding to a possible 911.

361
01:12:07,923 --> 01:12:09,798
Oh my God.

362
01:12:33,732 --> 01:12:35,533
Freeze!
Do not move!

363
01:12:35,733 --> 01:12:37,167
Freeze!

364
01:12:37,769 --> 01:12:39,126
Raise your arms!

365
01:12:39,227 --> 01:12:40,711
Raise 'em!

366
01:12:41,112 --> 01:12:42,513
Drop your weapon!

367
01:12:43,817 --> 01:12:45,656
Drop the weapon!

368
01:12:47,558 --> 01:12:49,554
Unit 316, dispatch...

369
01:13:43,731 --> 01:13:45,316
Hannah?
Hannah, stay back.

370
01:13:58,717 --> 01:14:00,217
My God, he's gonna
blow the house up.

371
01:14:02,036 --> 01:14:03,465
He's gonna blow up
the house.

372
01:14:14,980 --> 01:14:17,911
Unit 316, all units
are responding.

373
01:14:31,430 --> 01:14:32,916
Hurry!

374
01:14:43,232 --> 01:14:44,037
He's coming!

375
01:14:44,038 --> 01:14:45,873
He's supposed to come
down the stairs okay?

376
01:14:45,874 --> 01:14:47,474
He's coming! Hurry!

377
01:14:53,882 --> 01:14:55,866
I'm gonna go up there and
I'm gonna pull you up okay?

378
01:14:55,967 --> 01:14:57,470
- Okay.
- Stay right here.

379
01:15:37,524 --> 01:15:39,520
What are you doing?

380
01:17:11,050 --> 01:17:13,052
Come here...
You gotta help me.

381
01:17:22,064 --> 01:17:23,610
It's broken.

382
01:21:15,732 --> 01:21:16,959
This guy, the exterminator.

383
01:21:17,060 --> 01:21:19,560
He was the same guy working
earlier in the day right?

384
01:21:20,338 --> 01:21:21,898
And you saw his face?

385
01:21:21,933 --> 01:21:22,468
Yes, I saw.

386
01:21:23,969 --> 01:21:25,617
What happened
inside the house?

387
01:21:26,219 --> 01:21:27,756
Tried to save 'em...

388
01:21:28,857 --> 01:21:30,610
I really did...

389
01:21:31,715 --> 01:21:35,275
Sir? Company's called MASTER TRAP
EXTERMINATION. We got an address.

390
01:21:36,176 --> 01:21:37,855
Pull him tight and get
him to the hospital.

391
01:22:10,201 --> 01:22:11,803
What time is it?

392
01:22:16,612 --> 01:22:18,316
Just before midnight.

393
01:22:21,122 --> 01:22:22,547
I made it.

394
01:22:23,048 --> 01:22:24,450
What?

395
01:22:25,553 --> 01:22:27,296
I need you to
call my wife.

396
01:22:28,400 --> 01:22:30,211
They'll take care of
all that at the hospital.

397
01:22:30,714 --> 01:22:33,304
Come on now. You gotta...
You gotta call her.

398
01:22:33,305 --> 01:22:35,309
Alright! Alright!
What's the number?

01:23:10,259 --> 01:23:11,505
