1
00:01:51,987 --> 00:01:53,988
<i>It was 1947,</i>

2
00:01:54,406 --> 00:01:56,949
<i>two years after the war,
when I began my journey</i>

3
00:01:57,034 --> 00:02:00,203
<i>to what my father called
the "Sodom of the north,"</i>

4
00:02:00,287 --> 00:02:01,537
<i>New York.</i>

5
00:02:02,581 --> 00:02:03,956
<i>Call me Stingo,</i>

6
00:02:04,041 --> 00:02:06,793
<i>which was the nickname
I was known by in those days,</i>

7
00:02:06,877 --> 00:02:09,212
<i>if I was called anything at all.</i>

8
00:02:10,255 --> 00:02:13,424
<i>I had barely saved enough money
to write my novel,</i>

9
00:02:14,259 --> 00:02:18,554
<i>for I wanted beyond hope or dreaming
to be a writer.</i>

10
00:02:19,014 --> 00:02:21,641
<i>But my spirit had remained landlocked,</i>

11
00:02:22,142 --> 00:02:25,478
<i>unacquainted with love
and a stranger to death.</i>

12
00:02:28,482 --> 00:02:29,482
<i>Even back then,</i>

13
00:02:29,566 --> 00:02:32,693
<i>cheap apartments were hard to find
in Manhattan.</i>

14
00:02:34,696 --> 00:02:37,448
<i>And so began my voyage of discovery</i>

15
00:02:38,450 --> 00:02:40,910
<i>in a place as strange as Brooklyn.</i>

16
00:03:04,935 --> 00:03:06,143
I know.

17
00:03:06,603 --> 00:03:10,064
You're thinking about the pink.
Everybody does.

18
00:03:10,941 --> 00:03:14,318
See, my late husband Saul,
he got his bargain.

19
00:03:14,778 --> 00:03:19,574
Hundreds and hundreds of gallons
of this navy surplus paint.

20
00:03:20,033 --> 00:03:23,911
See, I guess they didn't have any use for pink
on those boats, huh?

21
00:03:26,665 --> 00:03:28,457
Okay, I'll take it.

22
00:04:44,284 --> 00:04:45,493
Oh, I love you!

23
00:05:15,107 --> 00:05:17,024
Don't go! Don't go!

24
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:19,068
- I'm out of here. Don't!
- No!

25
00:05:27,828 --> 00:05:29,578
We need each other.

26
00:05:35,669 --> 00:05:38,004
I told you to leave me alone.

27
00:05:38,088 --> 00:05:40,339
Stay away from me.
Get out of my way.

28
00:05:40,424 --> 00:05:41,924
No, no, don't!

29
00:05:42,843 --> 00:05:45,177
- I'm not lying, you know!
- You're lying.

30
00:05:45,345 --> 00:05:46,887
- I'm not!
- You're lying.

31
00:05:47,222 --> 00:05:50,391
Please, don't go!
Don't go away from me, please!

32
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,518
You know we need each other, Nathan,
you know this.

33
00:05:52,602 --> 00:05:53,644
We need each other.

34
00:05:53,729 --> 00:05:54,687
- Me need you?
- Yes...

35
00:05:54,771 --> 00:05:56,439
Let me tell you something.

36
00:05:56,523 --> 00:06:00,609
I need you like any goddamned
insufferable disease I can name!

37
00:06:00,694 --> 00:06:03,612
I need you like a case of anthrax,
hear me?

38
00:06:03,905 --> 00:06:05,489
Like trichinosis.

39
00:06:05,574 --> 00:06:10,536
I need you like a biliary calculus,
pellagra, encephalitis.

40
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:12,538
Bright's disease, for Christ's sake!

41
00:06:12,622 --> 00:06:14,498
Carcinoma of the brain!

42
00:06:14,875 --> 00:06:17,251
I need you like death.

43
00:06:17,544 --> 00:06:19,336
Hear me? Like death.

44
00:06:19,421 --> 00:06:20,796
No, Nathan.

45
00:06:21,757 --> 00:06:23,758
Go back to Krakow, baby.

46
00:06:24,301 --> 00:06:25,968
Back to Krakow!

47
00:06:31,957 --> 00:06:33,642
Well, good evening.

48
00:06:34,269 --> 00:06:35,895
Did you have a good time?

49
00:06:35,979 --> 00:06:37,563
I mean, did you enjoy our little show?

50
00:06:37,647 --> 00:06:40,608
Do you get off
on your little bit of eavesdropping?

51
00:06:40,692 --> 00:06:43,027
You just... My door was open.
I just wondered what was going on.

52
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:46,614
Your door was open?
You wondered what was going on?

53
00:06:46,698 --> 00:06:51,327
Well, shut my mouth if it isn't
our new literate figure from the South.

54
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:55,539
Too bad I won't be around
for a little lively conversation.

55
00:06:55,749 --> 00:06:59,168
We would've had a great time,
you and I, shooting the shit.

56
00:06:59,252 --> 00:07:01,587
We could've talked about sports.

57
00:07:02,172 --> 00:07:03,756
Southern sports like

58
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:07,676
lynching niggers, or "coons,"
I think you all call them down there.

59
00:07:09,513 --> 00:07:12,389
So long, cracker.
See you in another life.

60
00:07:16,228 --> 00:07:17,520
You okay?

61
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:19,522
Yes.

62
00:07:21,066 --> 00:07:22,191
Yeah.

63
00:07:30,291 --> 00:07:31,534
I'm very sorry.

64
00:07:36,665 --> 00:07:38,374
That's not the way

65
00:07:40,043 --> 00:07:41,919
he really is, you know?

66
00:07:43,046 --> 00:07:45,339
No, don't apologize, all right?

67
00:07:45,966 --> 00:07:48,467
I live downstairs here.
If there's anything you want...

68
00:07:48,552 --> 00:07:49,927
Thank you.

69
00:07:53,390 --> 00:07:55,057
You're very kind.

70
00:07:55,433 --> 00:07:56,976
Anyway, I'm downstairs here.

71
00:07:57,060 --> 00:07:58,519
No, I'm all right.

72
00:08:04,818 --> 00:08:06,235
I'm Stingo.

73
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:13,450
Please forgive us.

74
00:08:18,623 --> 00:08:22,334
Sixty cents. Anytime he raises 50 cents.

75
00:08:22,719 --> 00:08:23,711
Sixty...

76
00:08:27,257 --> 00:08:28,382
Yeah?

77
00:08:47,927 --> 00:08:50,279
We had invited you to dinner.

78
00:08:51,114 --> 00:08:53,282
That's very thoughtful of you.

79
00:08:53,450 --> 00:08:57,912
Uh, listen, I very often work at night
and type at night.

80
00:08:58,663 --> 00:09:00,998
But if it's going to bother you,
I don't want to...

81
00:09:01,082 --> 00:09:02,082
Oh, no!

82
00:09:02,167 --> 00:09:03,250
When I was a little girl,

83
00:09:03,335 --> 00:09:08,255
my father type and I go to sleep
to that sound.

84
00:09:09,799 --> 00:09:11,592
It'll make me feel...

85
00:09:13,303 --> 00:09:14,929
God, how do you say that?

86
00:09:15,013 --> 00:09:16,972
Secure. Secure.

87
00:09:18,642 --> 00:09:20,059
Your father was a writer?

88
00:09:20,143 --> 00:09:21,852
No, my father was...

89
00:09:21,937 --> 00:09:24,104
My father was professor of law.

90
00:09:24,189 --> 00:09:25,814
He wrote articles

91
00:09:26,149 --> 00:09:29,652
warning Polish people of the Nazi threat

92
00:09:30,612 --> 00:09:34,615
and trying to get help for those Jews
that was persecuted, so.

93
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:39,370
Yeah, that sound of typing
will make me think of my father

94
00:09:40,705 --> 00:09:42,498
and of his goodness.

95
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:45,000
You wouldn't want to come in,
would you?

96
00:09:45,835 --> 00:09:47,544
Maybe some other time.

97
00:09:47,629 --> 00:09:49,588
So, if you'll forgive me.

98
00:09:51,007 --> 00:09:52,675
- Good night.
- Yeah.

99
00:09:54,010 --> 00:09:55,094
Stinko, yeah?

100
00:09:55,971 --> 00:09:57,388
Stingo.

101
00:09:57,472 --> 00:09:58,848
Stingo, yes!

102
00:09:59,849 --> 00:10:01,809
I never hear that name.

103
00:10:02,644 --> 00:10:03,811
There's no "K" in there, though.

104
00:10:03,895 --> 00:10:04,895
I got it.

105
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:06,522
Just a "G."

106
00:10:07,148 --> 00:10:08,274
Yeah, it's nice!

107
00:10:09,442 --> 00:10:13,153
It's a friendly, you know, happy sound.

108
00:10:13,446 --> 00:10:14,530
I like it.

109
00:12:09,011 --> 00:12:10,437
Oh, Nathan!

110
00:12:13,566 --> 00:12:14,775
Oh, Nathan.

111
00:12:21,324 --> 00:12:22,825
Oh, God!

112
00:12:31,835 --> 00:12:35,212
Don't you see, Sophie?
We are dying.

113
00:12:41,553 --> 00:12:45,264
Rise and shine, honey child.
Stir them lazy bones.

114
00:12:45,849 --> 00:12:48,308
The grits on the griddle,
the corn's on the pone.

115
00:12:48,643 --> 00:12:50,978
Old Ponkers plan to hitch up
the coach and four.

116
00:12:51,354 --> 00:12:55,023
You're going to have a picnic out
and down by the seashore.

117
00:12:55,525 --> 00:12:56,984
Good morning, Stingo.

118
00:12:57,068 --> 00:12:58,068
Good morning.

119
00:12:59,112 --> 00:13:02,406
We wanted to make friends

120
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:05,200
and to take you out
on this beautiful summer day!

121
00:13:05,285 --> 00:13:07,828
We want you to come up
and have breakfast with us.

122
00:13:07,912 --> 00:13:09,204
- And then...
- Yes.

123
00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:10,456
Coney Island.

124
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:12,124
Coney Island! Oh, boy!

125
00:13:14,002 --> 00:13:15,919
Sorry about last night.

126
00:13:16,546 --> 00:13:17,713
Yeah.

127
00:13:48,828 --> 00:13:51,955
I know what you're thinking.
"These people are strange."

128
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:55,959
On Sundays, we like to dress up
a little differently and go out.

129
00:13:58,588 --> 00:14:00,088
- Okay.
- Okay?

130
00:14:00,298 --> 00:14:01,673
I knew you'd understand!

131
00:14:01,925 --> 00:14:05,093
You see, everybody out there
dresses the same.

132
00:14:05,428 --> 00:14:07,137
Look at those poor,
pathetic people out there.

133
00:14:07,222 --> 00:14:08,722
Look at them. Drones.

134
00:14:08,848 --> 00:14:11,600
All walking down the street,
all look alike,

135
00:14:11,684 --> 00:14:14,436
all wearing the same drab, boring uniform.

136
00:14:14,771 --> 00:14:16,230
You're boring!

137
00:14:16,564 --> 00:14:17,564
Morning!

138
00:14:19,275 --> 00:14:22,027
Now, this one. Look at this.
God's gift!

139
00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:24,112
Give me a kiss.

140
00:14:24,572 --> 00:14:25,614
One kiss. Please.

141
00:14:25,698 --> 00:14:28,867
All right, one kiss.
That's all you deserve.

142
00:14:28,952 --> 00:14:30,035
One more. I need one more.

143
00:14:30,119 --> 00:14:31,078
No.

144
00:14:31,162 --> 00:14:33,038
- I have to have one more.
- Nathan...

145
00:14:33,122 --> 00:14:35,290
Can't keep my hands off of you.

146
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:37,793
This is... No, Nathan Landau!

147
00:14:38,127 --> 00:14:39,262
What do you think of that, Stingo?

148
00:14:40,046 --> 00:14:42,631
Here I am, a nice Jewish boy,

149
00:14:43,758 --> 00:14:45,300
pushing 30.

150
00:14:45,468 --> 00:14:47,803
I fall crazy in love with a Polish shiksa.

151
00:14:48,388 --> 00:14:49,888
What is that? What is a "shiksa"?

152
00:14:49,973 --> 00:14:54,309
A shiksa is a goy girl.
A lady of the Gentile persuasion.

153
00:14:56,104 --> 00:14:57,279
She's a...

154
00:14:57,814 --> 00:15:01,316
All right. I just assumed that she was...

155
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:03,902
- She was Jewish?
- Yeah.

156
00:15:03,987 --> 00:15:05,153
Jewish?

157
00:15:05,321 --> 00:15:08,824
No, no, no.
No, our Sophie is Catholic.

158
00:15:10,702 --> 00:15:14,288
Yeah. Well, it's okay,
but I'm not anymore Catholic, so.

159
00:15:14,831 --> 00:15:16,373
Well, Catholic-ish.

160
00:15:17,834 --> 00:15:20,168
When I first met this one here,

161
00:15:20,503 --> 00:15:23,255
she was a rag and a bone
and a hank of hair.

162
00:15:23,715 --> 00:15:25,340
And that was a whole year-and-a-half

163
00:15:25,425 --> 00:15:28,260
after the Russians had liberated
the camp she was in.

164
00:15:28,344 --> 00:15:32,514
Yeah, it looked like something
that scares the birds.

165
00:15:32,724 --> 00:15:35,851
What is that? Scarecrow.

166
00:15:37,253 --> 00:15:38,645
I had "scurbut."

167
00:15:38,730 --> 00:15:41,398
No, no, no! She means scurvy.

168
00:15:41,691 --> 00:15:44,401
And typhus and anemia and scarlet fever.

169
00:15:44,485 --> 00:15:47,112
It was a fucking miracle
that she emerged from that camp alive.

170
00:15:47,196 --> 00:15:48,280
Right.

171
00:15:48,364 --> 00:15:52,034
I mean, I thought that I had leukemia.

172
00:15:54,579 --> 00:15:56,455
I thought I was dying.

173
00:15:57,206 --> 00:16:00,834
But it was Nathan that see
that it was only anemia.

174
00:16:01,544 --> 00:16:02,502
Are you a doctor?

175
00:16:02,587 --> 00:16:03,587
No, no.

176
00:16:03,671 --> 00:16:05,631
That's my brother's domain.

177
00:16:05,715 --> 00:16:06,673
But I'm a biologist.

178
00:16:06,758 --> 00:16:07,758
Yeah!

179
00:16:08,301 --> 00:16:10,385
- I graduated in science from Harvard.
- Harvard.

180
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:11,521
And he...

181
00:16:12,805 --> 00:16:17,267
MA in Developmental and Cellular Biology.

182
00:16:18,561 --> 00:16:19,645
I do research now.

183
00:16:19,729 --> 00:16:20,687
He works at Pfizer.

184
00:16:20,772 --> 00:16:23,815
Pfizer, it's a big pharmaceutical house
here in Brooklyn.

185
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:27,069
Anyway, I took her to this friend
of my brother's,

186
00:16:27,153 --> 00:16:29,488
a doctor who teaches up
at Columbia Presbyterian.

187
00:16:29,614 --> 00:16:30,697
Yeah.

188
00:16:30,782 --> 00:16:32,866
He confirmed my diagnosis.

189
00:16:33,076 --> 00:16:35,327
And we put the little sweetie here

190
00:16:35,411 --> 00:16:37,913
on massive doses of ferrous sulfate

191
00:16:38,915 --> 00:16:41,416
and she began to bloom like a rose.

192
00:16:42,794 --> 00:16:44,010
A rose.

193
00:16:44,962 --> 00:16:46,213
A rose.

194
00:16:48,007 --> 00:16:50,050
A beautiful fucking rose.

195
00:16:53,429 --> 00:16:55,097
You're something.

196
00:16:55,598 --> 00:16:58,725
Thank you for making me
to bloom like a rose.

197
00:17:08,611 --> 00:17:11,029
Not "to bloom," just "bloom."

198
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:12,698
She's so good.
It's about time she was perfect.

199
00:17:12,782 --> 00:17:16,118
"To bloom." So what?
I mean, this is a ridiculous language!

200
00:17:16,202 --> 00:17:17,911
There's too many words!

201
00:17:17,995 --> 00:17:22,207
The word for "velocity," okay,
there's "fast, quick, rapid,"

202
00:17:22,291 --> 00:17:24,126
and they all mean the same thing.

203
00:17:24,210 --> 00:17:25,377
Swift, speedy.

204
00:17:25,461 --> 00:17:26,586
Hasty.

205
00:17:26,963 --> 00:17:28,422
- Fleet.
- Brisk.

206
00:17:28,756 --> 00:17:30,716
- Expeditious.
- Accelerated.

207
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:32,092
Winged.

208
00:17:32,552 --> 00:17:34,803
No, no! Stop it!

209
00:17:35,722 --> 00:17:37,305
It's ridiculous!

210
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:41,560
In French, it's so easy.
You say <i>vite.</i>

211
00:17:41,644 --> 00:17:44,855
Or in Polish, <i>szybko,</i>
and in Russian, <i>bystro.</i>

212
00:17:44,939 --> 00:17:48,525
It's only in the English it's so complicated!

213
00:17:48,609 --> 00:17:50,026
How many languages do you know?

214
00:17:50,111 --> 00:17:52,738
Well, my father was a linguist,
so I mean, I...

215
00:17:52,822 --> 00:17:56,491
He teach me German, French, Russian, Hungarian,

216
00:17:56,576 --> 00:17:58,410
the Slavic languages.

217
00:17:59,162 --> 00:18:02,664
So, what language I am butchering now?

218
00:18:03,583 --> 00:18:04,750
English!

219
00:18:04,959 --> 00:18:07,961
I bet your father was
a very interesting man.

220
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:14,301
Yeah, my father was

221
00:18:16,345 --> 00:18:17,971
a civilized man.

222
00:18:22,435 --> 00:18:25,187
That's the word, yeah? "Civilized"?

223
00:18:25,563 --> 00:18:27,439
- Very good word.
- Yeah?

224
00:18:27,523 --> 00:18:31,276
My father was a civilized man
living in a non-civilized time.

225
00:18:31,861 --> 00:18:34,780
The civilized, they was the first to die.

226
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:39,117
Do you play the piano?

227
00:18:39,410 --> 00:18:42,037
No. I used to play, but I...

228
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:47,501
I no longer play.

229
00:18:49,879 --> 00:18:51,546
I don't anymore.

230
00:18:52,715 --> 00:18:55,175
My mother was a beautiful pianist.

231
00:19:00,890 --> 00:19:05,060
Nathan surprised me
with that piano on my birthday!

232
00:19:31,462 --> 00:19:33,171
I love that piece.

233
00:19:48,729 --> 00:19:50,272
When I was a little girl,

234
00:19:51,566 --> 00:19:53,650
I remember, I'd lay in bed

235
00:19:53,734 --> 00:19:57,404
and I'd hear my mother downstairs
playing the piano,

236
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:02,367
and the sound of my father's typewriter.

237
00:20:05,204 --> 00:20:10,500
I think no child has a more
wonderful father and mother.

238
00:20:16,632 --> 00:20:18,550
And a more beautiful life.

239
00:20:36,152 --> 00:20:37,819
<i>Swanee,</i> you know that song, right?

240
00:20:53,878 --> 00:20:55,170
Stingo, hit it!

241
00:21:59,902 --> 00:22:02,404
Oh, God!

242
00:22:02,571 --> 00:22:05,073
<i>Suddenly, I shivered violently.</i>

243
00:22:06,492 --> 00:22:09,619
<i>I remembered Nathan's voice
that night before.</i>

244
00:22:11,247 --> 00:22:14,833
<i>"Don't you see, Sophie?
We are dying."</i>

245
00:22:16,043 --> 00:22:18,545
<i>I longed desperately to escape,</i>

246
00:22:19,255 --> 00:22:21,423
<i>to pack my bags and flee.</i>

247
00:22:22,216 --> 00:22:23,758
<i>But I did not.</i>

248
00:22:25,469 --> 00:22:27,679
<i>I stayed at Yetta Zimmerman's,</i>

249
00:22:27,763 --> 00:22:32,392
<i>and thus I helped fulfill Sophie's prophecy
about the three of us.</i>

250
00:22:32,476 --> 00:22:34,978
<i>We became the best of friends.</i>

251
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:16,246
Here is an example of how emotionally
evocative English can be.

252
00:24:16,330 --> 00:24:19,624
<i>Sophie loved to tell
how Nathan saved her life.</i>

253
00:24:20,501 --> 00:24:24,129
<i>Their meeting was, for her, a miracle.</i>

254
00:24:24,213 --> 00:24:26,965
"Because I could not stop for Death,

255
00:24:27,216 --> 00:24:30,135
"he kindly stopped for me.

256
00:24:30,219 --> 00:24:34,013
"The carriage held but just ourselves
and Immortality."

257
00:24:35,391 --> 00:24:37,267
Rhymes, rhymes.

258
00:24:37,351 --> 00:24:39,102
It's not hard enough
to understand the language.

259
00:24:40,271 --> 00:24:43,356
Just everyday life talk.
He has to read us rhymes!

260
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:47,694
...what the beauty of the language can be
when written by artists.

261
00:24:48,737 --> 00:24:51,865
I look forward to seeing you all next week.
And now remember,

262
00:24:53,033 --> 00:24:55,160
you must not get discouraged.

263
00:24:55,744 --> 00:24:57,203
You'll see.

264
00:24:57,288 --> 00:25:00,623
One morning, you'll wake up
and find you've been dreaming in English.

265
00:25:02,084 --> 00:25:04,878
Excuse me.
Who did he say wrote that poem?

266
00:25:04,962 --> 00:25:06,671
Dickens.

267
00:25:06,755 --> 00:25:08,423
Emily Dickens.

268
00:25:08,507 --> 00:25:09,966
Thank you.

269
00:25:14,805 --> 00:25:19,267
All I want is that we should be able
to make living...

270
00:25:22,771 --> 00:25:25,648
Are you all right, Miss Zawistowska?

271
00:25:32,281 --> 00:25:33,615
Yes.

272
00:25:35,659 --> 00:25:38,286
Thank you, I'm very fine.

273
00:25:38,370 --> 00:25:39,787
I'm a little tired.

274
00:25:39,872 --> 00:25:44,792
I noticed that you've been looking, well,
a little delicate lately.

275
00:25:46,378 --> 00:25:47,754
I hope I'm not being too personal.

276
00:25:47,838 --> 00:25:49,589
No! No, I...

277
00:25:51,217 --> 00:25:53,676
Could you help me with that?

278
00:26:01,518 --> 00:26:02,977
Thank you.

279
00:26:04,730 --> 00:26:06,564
Thank you for your

280
00:26:08,275 --> 00:26:09,442
concern.

281
00:26:17,910 --> 00:26:19,369
Goodbye.

282
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:46,938
Excuse me, sir. Could you tell me what...

283
00:26:49,483 --> 00:26:53,361
Where would be that listing
in catalog file

284
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:55,530
for

285
00:26:57,700 --> 00:27:01,077
19th century American poet,

286
00:27:03,497 --> 00:27:05,581
Emily Dickens, please?

287
00:27:05,791 --> 00:27:07,792
In the catalog room on the left.

288
00:27:09,503 --> 00:27:11,379
But you won't find
any such listing.

289
00:27:13,257 --> 00:27:15,174
Oh, I won't find that listing?

290
00:27:16,844 --> 00:27:20,221
Why wouldn't I find it?

291
00:27:23,392 --> 00:27:26,477
Charles Dickens is an English writer.

292
00:27:27,396 --> 00:27:29,689
There is no American poet
by the name of Dickens.

293
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:38,531
I'm sorry. No, that is,
I'm sure, American poet.

294
00:27:41,035 --> 00:27:42,035
Emily Dickens.

295
00:27:42,119 --> 00:27:43,244
Listen!

296
00:27:43,996 --> 00:27:45,747
- D-I...
- I told you!

297
00:27:46,749 --> 00:27:47,999
There's no such person.

298
00:27:48,459 --> 00:27:50,418
- Do you want me to draw you a picture?
- No.

299
00:27:50,502 --> 00:27:53,504
- I'm telling you, you hear me?
- All right.

300
00:28:09,980 --> 00:28:12,273
It's all right, it's all right.

301
00:28:18,781 --> 00:28:20,365
Just lie still.

302
00:28:21,492 --> 00:28:22,992
Let the doctor take care of everything.

303
00:28:25,996 --> 00:28:27,497
You're so beautiful.

304
00:28:28,957 --> 00:28:32,126
Yes! How did you get
to be so beautiful?

305
00:28:36,465 --> 00:28:38,966
I think I'm going to die.

306
00:28:42,096 --> 00:28:44,138
No, no, no.

307
00:28:44,223 --> 00:28:47,266
No, your pulse...

308
00:28:47,851 --> 00:28:51,270
Your pulse is fine. It's steady.

309
00:28:52,481 --> 00:28:54,524
You're going to live to be 100.

310
00:29:57,838 --> 00:29:59,922
Why I am so tired?

311
00:30:01,633 --> 00:30:06,554
The doctor thinks you need to get some color
into that beautiful white skin of yours.

312
00:30:06,638 --> 00:30:09,849
I'm going to take you
to see my brother.

313
00:30:09,933 --> 00:30:12,518
He is the best doctor going.

314
00:30:15,230 --> 00:30:16,397
No, but you...

315
00:30:16,482 --> 00:30:17,607
Oh, you thought I was a doctor?

316
00:30:17,941 --> 00:30:20,359
No. No, I'm a biologist.

317
00:30:21,528 --> 00:30:22,778
Have you been eating properly lately?

318
00:30:23,071 --> 00:30:26,032
Yes! Oh, yes! I am...

319
00:30:27,534 --> 00:30:31,746
I am six months in here, in US and...

320
00:30:34,041 --> 00:30:38,753
So I eat more good now
than in my life.

321
00:30:39,922 --> 00:30:43,049
You could've fallen behind with iron
and never had a chance to catch up.

322
00:30:44,259 --> 00:30:48,262
Look, I'm going to go now
but may I come back later?

323
00:30:48,388 --> 00:30:50,723
No, don't answer that.
I'll be back.

324
00:30:56,146 --> 00:30:57,605
Okay?

325
00:31:00,067 --> 00:31:01,567
Yeah, okay.

326
00:31:27,302 --> 00:31:29,011
How long you have been there?

327
00:31:29,972 --> 00:31:32,848
Just long enough to get dinner started.

328
00:31:34,309 --> 00:31:36,143
You look much better.

329
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:40,648
What did you do here?

330
00:31:42,693 --> 00:31:43,943
It looks beautiful.

331
00:31:44,903 --> 00:31:46,988
We're having calf's liver,

332
00:31:47,656 --> 00:31:51,951
prepared Veneziano in a special
vinaigrette sauce,

333
00:31:52,035 --> 00:31:53,703
loaded with iron,

334
00:31:53,787 --> 00:31:57,290
and leeks filled with iron.

335
00:31:57,374 --> 00:31:59,500
Also will improve the timbre of your voice.

336
00:32:00,210 --> 00:32:06,882
You know, Nero had leek served to him
every day to deepen his voice.

337
00:32:07,092 --> 00:32:08,926
No, I didn't know that.

338
00:32:09,344 --> 00:32:14,098
So that he could croon while he had Seneca
drawn and quartered.

339
00:32:15,642 --> 00:32:16,767
Let me help you there.

340
00:32:16,852 --> 00:32:18,853
No, no! You're not to move.

341
00:32:25,444 --> 00:32:28,154
Will <i>madame</i> taste the wine?

342
00:32:29,865 --> 00:32:32,283
"Château Margaux Grand Cru."

343
00:32:35,370 --> 00:32:37,246
My God!

344
00:32:37,331 --> 00:32:40,541
Special day, special wine.

345
00:33:05,859 --> 00:33:08,027
You know, when you...

346
00:33:10,072 --> 00:33:13,324
When you live a good life

347
00:33:15,202 --> 00:33:19,163
like a saint and then you die,

348
00:33:22,334 --> 00:33:27,213
that must be what they make you
to drink in paradise.

349
00:33:32,594 --> 00:33:33,594
Yeah.

350
00:33:41,353 --> 00:33:43,145
Thomas Wolfe.

351
00:33:51,154 --> 00:33:53,948
<i>Look Homeward, Angel.</i>

352
00:33:57,202 --> 00:33:58,577
Oh, God!

353
00:33:59,454 --> 00:34:02,039
What does Wolfe sound like in Polish?

354
00:34:18,473 --> 00:34:21,058
A stone, a leaf, an unfound door.

355
00:34:25,355 --> 00:34:26,397
Of a stone.

356
00:34:27,774 --> 00:34:28,774
A leaf.

357
00:34:30,402 --> 00:34:31,902
- The door.
- The door.

358
00:34:37,159 --> 00:34:38,534
Of all the forgotten faces.

359
00:34:38,618 --> 00:34:40,286
Forgotten faces.

360
00:34:41,371 --> 00:34:44,165
God! This is a first.

361
00:34:48,837 --> 00:34:51,547
Hearing Thomas Wolfe read aloud in Polish.

362
00:34:51,631 --> 00:34:57,011
Yeah, the first for me too hearing
that Wolfe read in English.

363
00:35:00,849 --> 00:35:04,518
God, if that poor bastard Wolfe had heard you
read this aloud in Polish,

364
00:35:04,603 --> 00:35:05,686
he would've written in Polish.

365
00:35:05,771 --> 00:35:07,104
No, I don't think so.

366
00:35:07,189 --> 00:35:09,315
Oh, yeah! Oh, yes!

367
00:35:14,529 --> 00:35:16,155
You were...

368
00:35:16,740 --> 00:35:19,033
You were in a concentration camp?

369
00:35:22,704 --> 00:35:24,371
Yeah, I can't...

370
00:35:26,458 --> 00:35:28,292
Can't talk about that, though.

371
00:35:28,376 --> 00:35:29,376
I'm sorry.

372
00:35:31,379 --> 00:35:36,133
I have a knack for sticking my big schnoz
into places where it's got no business.

373
00:35:37,552 --> 00:35:38,761
I

374
00:35:40,180 --> 00:35:42,515
want so much to know you,

375
00:35:43,725 --> 00:35:45,726
to be close to you.

376
00:35:52,984 --> 00:35:55,402
Emily, Emily Dickinson?

377
00:35:56,363 --> 00:35:58,030
That's the woman?

378
00:35:58,698 --> 00:36:01,200
Oh, no! Oh, no!

379
00:36:02,911 --> 00:36:05,246
"Property of Nathan Landau."

380
00:36:06,206 --> 00:36:08,082
- That's you?
- That's me.

381
00:36:08,583 --> 00:36:09,542
It's your book?

382
00:36:09,626 --> 00:36:10,751
No, it's yours.

383
00:36:14,214 --> 00:36:15,506
Thank you!

384
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:18,217
Thank you.

385
00:36:31,523 --> 00:36:33,899
"Ample make this bed.

386
00:36:34,985 --> 00:36:37,778
"Make this bed with awe.

"In it, wait till judgment break,

"Let no sunrise yellow noise

00:37:00,552 --> 00:37:02,970
"interrupt this ground."

393
00:37:15,025 --> 00:37:18,277
<i>Nathan, my new and dear beloved friend,</i>

394
00:37:18,361 --> 00:37:24,742
<i>introduced me to what seemed the answer
to my relentless all-consuming horniness.</i>

395
00:37:25,035 --> 00:37:28,829
Before I went into analysis,
I was completely frigid.

396
00:37:28,914 --> 00:37:30,581
Can you imagine?

397
00:37:30,665 --> 00:37:32,750
Now all I can do is think about fucking.

398
00:37:32,834 --> 00:37:35,461
Wilhelm Reich has turned me into a nympho.

399
00:37:35,545 --> 00:37:38,672
I mean, sex on the brain!

400
00:37:39,341 --> 00:37:42,509
<i>Her name still curls across my tongue.</i>

401
00:37:42,677 --> 00:37:45,012
<i>Leslie Lapidus.</i>

402
00:37:46,514 --> 00:37:48,349
Door is open, come in!

403
00:37:51,686 --> 00:37:53,020
Hello!

404
00:38:09,162 --> 00:38:11,080
Boy, you look excellent.

405
00:38:11,581 --> 00:38:13,165
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

406
00:38:15,794 --> 00:38:17,169
What would you like to drink?

407
00:38:17,253 --> 00:38:18,629
I'll have a...

408
00:38:21,841 --> 00:38:24,051
I don't know, let's see.

409
00:38:27,305 --> 00:38:29,223
- I think I'll have a...
- Oh, my God!

410
00:38:30,058 --> 00:38:31,767
Oh, fuck!

411
00:38:33,395 --> 00:38:35,729
Fucking, fantastic fucking!

412
00:38:45,073 --> 00:38:46,907
Wait! Just let it ring!

413
00:38:52,297 --> 00:38:53,664
Hello, Mother.

414
00:38:53,748 --> 00:38:57,292
I'm fine, fine.
Yeah, I told you I'd be just fine.

415
00:38:57,377 --> 00:38:58,877
Yeah, plenty.

416
00:38:58,962 --> 00:39:01,380
Yeah, I'll make sure
that the plants are watered

417
00:39:01,464 --> 00:39:04,341
and the dog is fed.
Well, Mother...

418
00:39:04,759 --> 00:39:08,512
Yes, Daddy.
Yes, your little princess will be good.

419
00:39:08,596 --> 00:39:09,972
Okay. Bye!

420
00:39:11,766 --> 00:39:14,476
They go away for the weekend
and then the maid's out sick.

421
00:39:14,561 --> 00:39:20,816
And they carry on about how will I survive
for a weekend in this apartment by myself.

422
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:24,820
And that's with this totally stocked fridge,
and a lock on every door,

423
00:39:24,946 --> 00:39:27,281
and God only knows what else.

424
00:39:29,451 --> 00:39:34,913
<i>Thus, I realized that Leslie and I
would be left to frolic in this place alone.</i>

425
00:39:34,998 --> 00:39:36,957
<i>My cup ran over.</i>

426
00:39:37,042 --> 00:39:42,546
<i>Oh, my cup turned into a spillway
flooding across the spotless carpet,</i>

427
00:39:42,630 --> 00:39:45,382
<i>out the door down Pierrepont Street,</i>

428
00:39:45,467 --> 00:39:49,470
<i>across all the twilit
carnal reaches of Brooklyn.</i>

429
00:39:50,805 --> 00:39:52,389
<i>Leslie.</i>

430
00:39:52,474 --> 00:39:55,476
<i>A weekend alone with Leslie.</i>

431
00:39:55,727 --> 00:40:00,272
Have you ever read D.H. Lawrence,
<i>Lady Chatterley's Lover?</i>

432
00:40:00,857 --> 00:40:01,916
No.

433
00:40:03,485 --> 00:40:07,654
He has the answers.
He knows so much about fucking.

434
00:40:08,990 --> 00:40:11,075
He says...

435
00:40:11,159 --> 00:40:14,495
He says that when you fuck,
you go to the Dark Gods.

436
00:40:16,247 --> 00:40:18,207
Stingo, I really mean it.

437
00:40:18,666 --> 00:40:22,461
To fuck is to go to the Dark Gods.

438
00:40:25,131 --> 00:40:27,424
Let's go to the Dark Gods!

439
00:41:05,380 --> 00:41:08,215
Well, I think I have the right to ask,
what is going on?

440
00:41:09,217 --> 00:41:11,301
You don't understand.

441
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:14,888
I can't go all the way.

442
00:41:18,309 --> 00:41:20,727
I've reached a plateau in my analysis.

443
00:41:21,604 --> 00:41:24,064
Before I reach this plateau of vocalization,

444
00:41:24,149 --> 00:41:26,900
I could never have said
any of those words.

445
00:41:27,735 --> 00:41:32,739
Those Anglo-Saxon four letter words
that everybody should be able to say.

446
00:41:33,658 --> 00:41:36,285
Now I'm completely able to vocalize.

447
00:41:39,581 --> 00:41:43,750
<i>Leslie Lapidus could say "fuck,"
but she could not do it.</i>

448
00:41:50,508 --> 00:41:51,550
Nathan!

449
00:41:52,260 --> 00:41:53,927
I'm so glad you're...

450
00:41:55,388 --> 00:41:57,097
Yeah, little ol' Stingo.

451
00:41:59,434 --> 00:42:01,310
- Stingo?
- Yeah?

452
00:42:03,771 --> 00:42:06,523
You want to come up
and have a night hat with me?

453
00:42:06,608 --> 00:42:07,691
Sure.

454
00:42:08,443 --> 00:42:10,903
You know, when Nathan gets involved,

455
00:42:10,987 --> 00:42:14,948
he forgets all about the time
and I don't know.

456
00:42:17,952 --> 00:42:20,037
Stingo, you look...

457
00:42:20,121 --> 00:42:23,290
You look very nice.
You're wearing your "cocksucker."

458
00:42:25,210 --> 00:42:27,377
It's my seersucker.

459
00:42:27,462 --> 00:42:30,130
Oh, yeah. Right, seersucker.

460
00:42:43,102 --> 00:42:44,728
I love it here.

461
00:42:49,859 --> 00:42:51,777
I'm glad you couldn't sleep.

462
00:42:57,242 --> 00:42:59,701
You hurt your mouth?
You talk funny.

463
00:43:00,745 --> 00:43:02,246
I bit my tongue.

464
00:43:03,748 --> 00:43:05,040
You want me to get something for you?

465
00:43:05,124 --> 00:43:06,833
No, please, no.

466
00:43:06,918 --> 00:43:09,419
It just needs to be left alone.

467
00:43:10,588 --> 00:43:11,588
Hey, what you...

468
00:43:11,673 --> 00:43:13,257
You've changed all the furniture around?

469
00:43:15,009 --> 00:43:18,136
Yeah, you like it?
I do that when I can't sleep, you know.

470
00:43:18,221 --> 00:43:21,515
It's a good thing to do
because then you don't...

471
00:43:22,350 --> 00:43:25,185
You don't have to think about anything.

472
00:43:26,020 --> 00:43:27,938
Well, I better try that.

473
00:43:28,022 --> 00:43:29,356
Oh, no.

474
00:43:31,985 --> 00:43:33,777
Stingo.

475
00:43:33,861 --> 00:43:36,071
You do not have to move furniture.

476
00:43:39,575 --> 00:43:41,493
You will move mountains.

477
00:43:41,577 --> 00:43:43,245
Right now, I can't even move my tongue.

478
00:43:43,329 --> 00:43:46,039
Maybe you moved it too much.

479
00:43:49,627 --> 00:43:51,670
Why aren't all the women
in the world like you?

480
00:43:51,754 --> 00:43:53,839
You'd better thank God they're not.
Look at this.

481
00:43:53,923 --> 00:43:56,717
I see many, many women in your life.

482
00:43:56,801 --> 00:44:02,222
Many beautiful women who adore you
and who'll make all that love with you.

483
00:44:03,057 --> 00:44:08,145
Sometimes, I can see myself
just being alone forever.

484
00:44:09,522 --> 00:44:13,442
Oh, Stingo. I'm not fair with you.

485
00:44:13,735 --> 00:44:15,944
I think, "Oh, Stingo, he's so young.

486
00:44:16,029 --> 00:44:18,405
"He's a talented American." You know.

487
00:44:18,489 --> 00:44:23,201
"He doesn't have any real,
real problems, but..."

488
00:44:23,328 --> 00:44:25,912
You don't know if I'm really talented.

489
00:44:25,997 --> 00:44:27,664
You've never read anything I've written.

490
00:44:27,749 --> 00:44:32,627
Well, I mean, I don't ask you about that work
because, you know, what it's about

491
00:44:32,837 --> 00:44:38,091
because I know that a writer,
he likes to be quiet about his work.

492
00:44:39,927 --> 00:44:41,595
It's about a boy.

493
00:44:44,098 --> 00:44:45,332
A 12-year-old boy.

494
00:44:46,017 --> 00:44:49,436
- And...
- Yes, so it's autobiographical?

495
00:44:53,107 --> 00:44:56,068
Yeah, to a certain extent,
maybe it is.

496
00:44:57,911 --> 00:45:01,823
It takes place in a year,
which is the year his mother dies.

497
00:45:07,955 --> 00:45:10,624
I didn't know your mother died.

498
00:45:10,708 --> 00:45:11,958
When I was 12.

499
00:45:12,043 --> 00:45:14,086
You loved her very much?

500
00:45:14,170 --> 00:45:15,712
Not enough.

501
00:45:16,172 --> 00:45:18,256
What do you mean "not enough"?
What do you mean?

502
00:45:18,341 --> 00:45:20,258
I mean not enough.

503
00:45:25,640 --> 00:45:28,475
That is what is so terrible about

504
00:45:32,271 --> 00:45:35,982
outliving those people that we love.
I mean, that's...

505
00:45:36,484 --> 00:45:38,110
That guilt.

506
00:45:38,194 --> 00:45:39,903
Your father?

507
00:45:39,987 --> 00:45:42,322
My father, my mother, my husband.

508
00:45:44,659 --> 00:45:45,867
You were married?

509
00:45:49,372 --> 00:45:51,248
Yeah, I was married.

510
00:45:52,834 --> 00:45:58,505
When I was very young,
I was married to a disciple of my father.

511
00:45:59,507 --> 00:46:01,842
Assistant at the university.

512
00:46:03,010 --> 00:46:04,928
Your father's anti-Nazi writings,

513
00:46:05,012 --> 00:46:07,472
well, that probably got him in trouble.

514
00:46:07,598 --> 00:46:08,807
His writings.

515
00:46:08,891 --> 00:46:12,644
Well, one day, I was at the Mass

516
00:46:14,105 --> 00:46:15,605
and I have a...

517
00:46:18,276 --> 00:46:21,736
I had a presentiment.

518
00:46:23,030 --> 00:46:25,782
I had many fears and I...

519
00:46:25,867 --> 00:46:29,453
I run out of the church
and I go to the university,

520
00:46:29,537 --> 00:46:32,497
and I see that the gate is locked.

521
00:46:33,791 --> 00:46:36,418
And there were many, many Germans there.

522
00:46:38,379 --> 00:46:41,548
And I saw the professors.
They was loading them into the truck.

523
00:46:41,632 --> 00:46:45,719
And this one part of canvas has moved away.

524
00:46:46,554 --> 00:46:50,974
And I see my father's face
and the face of my husband behind him.

525
00:46:52,518 --> 00:46:53,977
And...

526
00:46:56,481 --> 00:46:57,981
I looked.

527
00:46:59,984 --> 00:47:01,902
But the German, he pulled that away

528
00:47:01,986 --> 00:47:05,280
and I never saw those faces again.

529
00:47:05,364 --> 00:47:07,157
They took them to Sachsenhausen, you know.

530
00:47:07,241 --> 00:47:10,494
That's a German work camp,
but they shot them the next day.

531
00:47:10,578 --> 00:47:12,787
That's what we have heard.

532
00:47:17,293 --> 00:47:18,460
Your mother?

533
00:47:18,544 --> 00:47:19,669
My mother...

534
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:22,380
My mother got

535
00:47:24,759 --> 00:47:27,928
tuberculosis and...

536
00:47:29,847 --> 00:47:32,307
Oh, she is very sick, you know.

537
00:47:32,391 --> 00:47:35,894
She started to die of that,
and I can't do anything.

538
00:47:38,523 --> 00:47:41,441
But I think if I could get <i>mieso...</i>

539
00:47:41,526 --> 00:47:44,986
If I could get that meat for my mother,
I would make her strong.

540
00:47:45,071 --> 00:47:47,280
So I go to the country,

541
00:47:48,115 --> 00:47:51,868
and the peasants there,
they're selling ham.

542
00:47:52,870 --> 00:47:56,289
And I go with that black market money,

543
00:47:56,374 --> 00:47:58,750
I buy that and I bring it back.

544
00:47:58,834 --> 00:48:00,418
But, you know,
this is forbidden because

545
00:48:00,503 --> 00:48:03,421
all the meat goes to the Germans, you know.

546
00:48:03,506 --> 00:48:05,131
If you get caught...

547
00:48:05,216 --> 00:48:09,553
So I hid the ham under my skirt
on the train.

548
00:48:09,637 --> 00:48:12,556
I'm pretending that I'm pregnant, you know.

549
00:48:13,082 --> 00:48:14,599
I was so afraid!

550
00:48:15,309 --> 00:48:16,643
I was shaking.

551
00:48:16,727 --> 00:48:19,020
And then that German,

552
00:48:21,399 --> 00:48:24,901
who was in the front of the train,
and he saw me.

553
00:48:24,986 --> 00:48:27,904
And I'm sitting there
and he came up to me

554
00:48:27,989 --> 00:48:30,824
and he take under my skirt that ham.

555
00:48:37,957 --> 00:48:40,417
So they sent me to Auschwitz.

556
00:48:42,962 --> 00:48:46,256
You were sent to Auschwitz
because you stole a ham?

557
00:48:46,340 --> 00:48:50,135
No. I was sent to Auschwitz
because they saw that I was afraid.

558
00:48:53,639 --> 00:48:55,265
Oh, yeah.

559
00:48:56,475 --> 00:48:57,601
You know what that means?

560
00:48:57,685 --> 00:48:58,727
Yeah.

561
00:48:59,770 --> 00:49:02,439
You tried to commit suicide in Auschwitz?

562
00:49:03,649 --> 00:49:06,234
No, it was after that.

563
00:49:06,319 --> 00:49:08,278
After that, I was in...

564
00:49:11,490 --> 00:49:12,866
After liberation.

565
00:49:12,950 --> 00:49:14,326
After you were safe?

566
00:49:14,952 --> 00:49:16,786
Yes, safe, yeah.

567
00:49:18,205 --> 00:49:22,626
I was safe. I was in Sweden.
I was in that refugee camp.

568
00:49:24,045 --> 00:49:27,339
I mean, that was good.
They try to help you, you know.

569
00:49:27,423 --> 00:49:29,799
They try to...

570
00:49:29,884 --> 00:49:32,385
They try, but...

571
00:49:38,017 --> 00:49:39,517
I knew that

572
00:49:41,228 --> 00:49:46,775
Christ had turned his face away from me.

573
00:49:47,860 --> 00:49:51,655
And that only a Jesus
who no longer cared for me

574
00:49:51,739 --> 00:49:54,908
could kill those people that I love,

575
00:49:57,161 --> 00:50:01,915
but leave me alive with my shame.

576
00:50:01,999 --> 00:50:04,959
Oh, God. So I went to that church.

577
00:50:05,711 --> 00:50:08,088
And I took the glass, I knelt down

578
00:50:08,172 --> 00:50:12,384
and I cut my wrist.

579
00:50:12,468 --> 00:50:15,428
But I didn't die, of course.

580
00:50:17,181 --> 00:50:19,099
Of course not.

581
00:50:30,861 --> 00:50:35,323
Stingo, there's so many things
you don't understand.

582
00:50:38,077 --> 00:50:41,538
There's so many things that I

583
00:50:42,289 --> 00:50:45,792
cannot tell you.

584
00:50:45,918 --> 00:50:47,636
I want you to trust me.

585
00:50:51,507 --> 00:50:53,842
I want you to trust me.

586
00:50:55,761 --> 00:50:57,387
Just trust me.

587
00:51:08,983 --> 00:51:12,652
Oh, God! There is Nathan!

588
00:51:14,947 --> 00:51:16,406
Nathan!

589
00:51:18,117 --> 00:51:20,493
- Sophie!
- Astrid!

590
00:51:22,329 --> 00:51:25,373
I'm working night duty
at Brooklyn Hospital this week.

591
00:51:25,458 --> 00:51:27,751
My patient is this old lady
who's meaner than my mother,

592
00:51:27,835 --> 00:51:29,002
if you can believe.

593
00:51:29,086 --> 00:51:32,380
Well, good night, Astrid.
Have a good sleep.

594
00:51:33,966 --> 00:51:36,676
That was Astrid, you know.

595
00:51:36,761 --> 00:51:38,344
Maybe I'll leave the door open.

596
00:51:38,429 --> 00:51:40,722
In case he comes, we could hear him.

597
00:51:40,806 --> 00:51:42,348
So you want another drink?

598
00:51:44,101 --> 00:51:45,894
- Your bottle is empty.
- Well...

599
00:51:47,188 --> 00:51:50,523
Oh, I know where Nathan keeps
another bottle.

600
00:51:54,153 --> 00:51:56,488
Be careful, it's dark in here.

601
00:52:02,495 --> 00:52:03,745
Oh, God.

602
00:52:03,829 --> 00:52:07,499
I think you'll feel better
if we just call him at the lab.

603
00:52:08,542 --> 00:52:10,210
I can't do that.

604
00:52:10,294 --> 00:52:14,964
I mean, he doesn't like for me to call him.
You know, at work.

605
00:52:15,299 --> 00:52:17,592
So, anyway.

606
00:52:18,969 --> 00:52:21,054
I did it an hour ago.

607
00:52:21,180 --> 00:52:23,932
And there was no answer, so.

608
00:52:24,016 --> 00:52:25,517
I'm sure the switchboard's just shut off.

609
00:52:25,601 --> 00:52:28,978
Yes, I think that's right.
I'm sure that...

610
00:52:29,063 --> 00:52:31,397
You know, sometimes when
he can't sleep at night,

611
00:52:31,482 --> 00:52:34,901
he goes and he walks
all over the city.

612
00:52:35,027 --> 00:52:38,488
Yeah, he goes into all these neighborhoods.

613
00:52:38,572 --> 00:52:42,534
I mean, I don't know where he goes,
but once he came back,

614
00:52:42,618 --> 00:52:48,414
he had a black eye and his jaw
was all swollen there.

615
00:52:48,499 --> 00:52:51,251
Yeah, I thought it was broken.

616
00:52:54,588 --> 00:52:57,257
You know, he could be hurt.

617
00:52:57,341 --> 00:53:01,553
I don't know where he is, but I think
we should call the police right now.

618
00:53:01,637 --> 00:53:04,472
No, look, I think we ought to wait two hours.

619
00:53:04,598 --> 00:53:07,225
You know, just wait till somebody
is on the switchboard there.

620
00:53:07,309 --> 00:53:08,685
We'll just call him then.

621
00:53:08,769 --> 00:53:12,689
He's working late. He probably
just got tired and fell asleep there.

622
00:53:12,773 --> 00:53:16,442
Yeah. He's probably asleep there.

623
00:53:18,529 --> 00:53:19,529
I'm sure.

624
00:53:19,613 --> 00:53:21,114
I'm sure you're right.

625
00:53:26,120 --> 00:53:28,454
Look at this. <i>The Nazi Primer.</i>

626
00:53:31,542 --> 00:53:34,252
He must have everything ever written
about the Nazis in those years.

627
00:53:34,336 --> 00:53:38,332
Yes, he is obsessed with the Nazis
that are escaping justice.

628
00:53:40,259 --> 00:53:42,802
Do you suppose all this started
after he met you?

629
00:53:43,053 --> 00:53:46,890
Look, I know I shouldn't tell him
about that place,

630
00:53:46,974 --> 00:53:48,766
but what could I do?

631
00:53:48,851 --> 00:53:51,769
- I know it's my fault that he...
- Look, I can understand.

632
00:53:52,646 --> 00:53:53,980
After all, he is a Jew.

633
00:53:54,940 --> 00:53:58,693
Yes, he is a Jew,
but don't you think that I'm angry, too?

634
00:53:58,777 --> 00:54:03,072
That these men, these terrible Nazis live,
and my father...

635
00:54:03,157 --> 00:54:06,326
Such a good man
who tries to help Jews is killed.

636
00:54:06,660 --> 00:54:08,578
Don't you think that I am angry?

637
00:54:08,662 --> 00:54:11,623
But, you know, you don't understand Nathan.

638
00:54:13,292 --> 00:54:15,418
You don't know.

639
00:54:20,591 --> 00:54:24,093
Him, what he might do, you know.
I think...

640
00:54:24,178 --> 00:54:25,219
Sometimes I think...

641
00:54:25,304 --> 00:54:26,638
What do you think?

642
00:54:30,559 --> 00:54:32,352
What do you think, Polish baby?

643
00:54:32,436 --> 00:54:33,686
Oh, Nathan!

644
00:54:36,273 --> 00:54:37,941
You are all right?

645
00:54:38,025 --> 00:54:39,651
I'm all right.
What about the two of you?

646
00:54:41,320 --> 00:54:45,715
Yeah, well, I was so frightened, you know.
I was stupid.

647
00:54:46,992 --> 00:54:49,577
I got so scared, you know,
I thought something had happened to you.

648
00:54:49,662 --> 00:54:52,705
I would've called, but I didn't want
to take the chance of waking you up.

649
00:54:52,790 --> 00:54:54,707
We're on to something in our work.
Something big.

650
00:54:54,792 --> 00:54:56,084
- Yeah?
- Something very big.

651
00:54:56,168 --> 00:54:57,669
That's wonderful, Nathan.

652
00:55:01,382 --> 00:55:03,132
Yeah, wonderful.

653
00:55:14,186 --> 00:55:16,104
But you were here

654
00:55:18,607 --> 00:55:20,108
with Sophie.

655
00:55:21,235 --> 00:55:24,153
Yes, Stingo, you know, he...

656
00:55:24,238 --> 00:55:26,664
Stingo came home from his date.

657
00:55:28,033 --> 00:55:32,412
So I heard the door, I thought it was you.
So I run out, but...

658
00:55:33,080 --> 00:55:36,708
Anyway, I called him, I said,
"Why don't you come up for a drink?"

659
00:55:36,792 --> 00:55:42,171
Because I was worried
and he was a very good friend to me.

660
00:55:42,256 --> 00:55:44,924
He was keeping me company.

661
00:55:59,606 --> 00:56:04,068
So now you've seen my sanctum sanctorum.

662
00:56:05,571 --> 00:56:09,073
Now you know all of Nathan's
dark and dour secrets.

663
00:56:10,242 --> 00:56:11,701
Hardly.

664
00:56:18,625 --> 00:56:22,462
They wipe out six million Jews

665
00:56:24,423 --> 00:56:26,466
and the world lets them escape.

666
00:56:29,678 --> 00:56:33,431
Wanna join me in a little lynching party,
Southern boy?

667
00:56:33,557 --> 00:56:36,309
I expect you might have
a lot to teach me there.

668
00:56:37,770 --> 00:56:40,271
I'm going to call it a night here.

669
00:56:40,355 --> 00:56:42,065
Stingo, wait.

670
00:56:42,149 --> 00:56:45,151
Stingo is our best friend.
Why do you do that?

671
00:56:46,153 --> 00:56:48,863
He is our best friend.
He deserves only our thanks.

672
00:56:48,947 --> 00:56:51,616
Nathan, listen to me.

673
00:56:51,700 --> 00:56:56,287
I was frightened, I didn't know what I would do
if he had not been here.

674
00:57:02,878 --> 00:57:04,378
It's true.

675
00:57:14,181 --> 00:57:16,724
Forgive me, old buddy. I'm sorry.

676
00:57:17,434 --> 00:57:19,393
Of course my beloved Sophie is right.

677
00:57:19,478 --> 00:57:20,436
Yeah.

678
00:57:20,521 --> 00:57:22,146
I must've got crazy with the work, you know.

679
00:57:22,231 --> 00:57:23,231
I know you do.

680
00:57:23,315 --> 00:57:24,273
We're on to something big.

681
00:57:24,358 --> 00:57:25,358
I know, darling.

682
00:57:25,442 --> 00:57:28,277
I'm just another mad scientist,
we're all a bunch of nuts.

683
00:57:28,362 --> 00:57:30,321
Come on...

684
00:57:30,906 --> 00:57:32,323
I'm leaving.

685
00:57:33,951 --> 00:57:35,785
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

686
00:57:36,245 --> 00:57:37,411
Thank you for taking care of Sophie.

687
00:57:37,496 --> 00:57:39,372
Yeah, all right.

688
00:57:46,421 --> 00:57:48,881
Oh, Nathan!

689
00:57:50,134 --> 00:57:52,135
I'm sorry.

690
00:57:56,390 --> 00:57:58,307
Darling, I'm home.

691
00:58:03,105 --> 00:58:04,772
- Right!
- Are you all right?

692
00:58:04,857 --> 00:58:05,857
Yeah. Yeah.

693
00:58:05,941 --> 00:58:07,316
Are you sure?

694
00:58:07,401 --> 00:58:08,651
Yeah.

695
00:58:08,735 --> 00:58:11,487
Don't you catch things in the South?

696
00:58:13,866 --> 00:58:14,824
How's it going?

697
00:58:14,908 --> 00:58:16,450
Fine. It's going well.

698
00:58:16,535 --> 00:58:17,910
Think fast!

699
00:58:19,163 --> 00:58:20,204
Jesus!

700
00:58:22,708 --> 00:58:24,500
You came in and you wreck everything.

701
00:58:24,585 --> 00:58:27,795
Yetta, you know, always provides the best.

702
00:58:27,880 --> 00:58:29,672
The best you can find in Brooklyn!

703
00:58:30,799 --> 00:58:32,592
Oh, shit!

704
00:58:34,386 --> 00:58:37,388
Sophie should be taking a nap after work.

705
00:58:39,433 --> 00:58:41,684
She just doesn't sleep anymore.
Not since the war.

706
00:58:41,768 --> 00:58:42,768
How's it going?

707
00:58:42,853 --> 00:58:44,854
Yeah, fine. Thank you.

708
00:58:44,938 --> 00:58:46,439
Well, let me take a look at those.

709
00:58:46,523 --> 00:58:48,065
- No. No, no, no!
- Come on!

710
00:58:48,150 --> 00:58:51,861
I won't interfere, I won't make any comments.
I won't even...

711
00:58:51,945 --> 00:58:54,363
Look, I've shown this to no one.
No one's seen this.

712
00:58:54,448 --> 00:58:57,366
Yeah, but I'm not no one.
I'm a friend.

713
00:58:57,451 --> 00:58:58,743
Don't you have those down South?

714
00:58:58,827 --> 00:59:00,161
"Friend," a person attached to another

715
00:59:00,245 --> 00:59:02,163
by a feeling of personal regard or affection.

716
00:59:02,247 --> 00:59:03,873
- Look.
- One who offers assistance.

717
00:59:03,957 --> 00:59:04,916
A patron, a supporter.

718
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:07,084
Look, I vowed to myself
when I started this,

719
00:59:07,169 --> 00:59:08,252
I was not going to show it to anyone

720
00:59:08,337 --> 00:59:10,338
until I finish the very last sentence.

721
00:59:10,422 --> 00:59:12,465
Then only after that,
can I offer it to any person.

722
00:59:12,549 --> 00:59:13,691
Well...

723
00:59:15,219 --> 00:59:18,888
Okay. You mean, you're just terrified
that somebody won't like it.

724
00:59:18,972 --> 00:59:20,514
Terrified as in filled with terror.

725
00:59:20,599 --> 00:59:23,267
Terror, a sharp, overmastering, intense fear.

726
00:59:23,393 --> 00:59:25,561
- All right, all right!
- That which renders the victim chicken shit.

727
00:59:25,646 --> 00:59:27,688
Yeah, all right, all right.

728
00:59:29,650 --> 00:59:31,734
That will give you some idea.

729
00:59:31,818 --> 00:59:32,985
Oh, my God!

730
00:59:35,489 --> 00:59:37,531
What about the page in the typewriter?

731
00:59:37,616 --> 00:59:38,950
No, this is a...

732
00:59:39,993 --> 00:59:42,036
Nathan! Stop!

733
00:59:42,746 --> 00:59:44,247
All right.

734
00:59:45,582 --> 00:59:48,876
Stingo! What is the worst that can happen?

735
00:59:49,670 --> 00:59:51,837
I may discover you can't write! Bye!

736
00:59:51,922 --> 00:59:52,922
Shit! Fuck!

737
00:59:53,006 --> 00:59:54,715
Nathan, get back here!

738
00:59:54,800 --> 00:59:57,176
It's beyond your reach now, old buddy!

739
00:59:59,930 --> 01:00:01,430
Fine, right!

740
01:00:03,850 --> 01:00:05,351
Stingo, wait a minute!

741
01:00:06,311 --> 01:00:10,022
Wait! Nathan have ordered me
to take you to the movies.

742
01:00:10,107 --> 01:00:12,900
He made me your guardian
while he read that.

743
01:00:12,985 --> 01:00:16,612
Yes, so you don't do
no violence to yourself now.

744
01:00:21,994 --> 01:00:23,536
Nathan must have finished reading that.

745
01:00:23,620 --> 01:00:24,620
Yeah.

746
01:00:24,705 --> 01:00:25,913
Come on, let's go see.

747
01:00:25,998 --> 01:00:27,581
I think I'll wait in my room.

748
01:00:28,308 --> 01:00:29,500
No, come on!

749
01:00:29,584 --> 01:00:32,253
If he's got something to say to me,
let him come down and tell me.

750
01:00:32,337 --> 01:00:33,921
Yes, don't be silly.

751
01:01:19,426 --> 01:01:20,593
Bravo.

752
01:02:42,259 --> 01:02:43,759
On this bridge,

753
01:02:45,720 --> 01:02:49,098
on which so many great American writers
have stood and reached out for words

754
01:02:49,182 --> 01:02:51,183
to give America its voice,

755
01:02:54,312 --> 01:02:57,231
looking toward the land
that gave us Whitman,

756
01:02:57,524 --> 01:03:02,194
from its Eastern edge dreamt his country's future
and gave it words,

757
01:03:05,073 --> 01:03:06,532
on this span

758
01:03:07,951 --> 01:03:10,786
of which Thomas Wolfe and Hart Crane wrote,

759
01:03:13,874 --> 01:03:18,461
we welcome Stingo
into that pantheon of the gods,

760
01:03:19,963 --> 01:03:23,340
whose words are all we know of immortality.

761
01:03:29,764 --> 01:03:31,974
To Stingo!

762
01:03:43,904 --> 01:03:46,989
<i>How could I have failed
to have the most helpless crush</i>

763
01:03:47,073 --> 01:03:51,494
<i>on such a generous mind
and life-enlarging mentor?</i>

764
01:03:52,537 --> 01:03:57,124
<i>Nathan was utterly, fatally glamorous.</i>

765
01:03:58,251 --> 01:03:59,460
Sophie!

766
01:04:01,087 --> 01:04:02,630
We did it!

767
01:04:03,590 --> 01:04:05,549
- Stingo!
- Nathan!

768
01:04:10,972 --> 01:04:12,014
We did it!

769
01:04:12,098 --> 01:04:13,807
What? What did you do?

770
01:04:21,191 --> 01:04:22,441
Nathan!

771
01:04:24,986 --> 01:04:26,362
Remember I told you the day
when I came home

772
01:04:26,446 --> 01:04:27,530
and I said we were on to something big?

773
01:04:27,614 --> 01:04:29,031
- Yeah.
- Today, we cracked it.

774
01:04:29,115 --> 01:04:31,033
What? What? What?

775
01:04:33,578 --> 01:04:35,788
I can't tell you.
I'll tell you about it all tonight.

776
01:04:35,872 --> 01:04:37,289
No, what's a few hours make?

777
01:04:37,374 --> 01:04:39,542
No, I can't tell you!

778
01:04:39,626 --> 01:04:40,834
Come on!

779
01:04:41,753 --> 01:04:43,462
Pretty soon, the whole world will know.

780
01:04:43,547 --> 01:04:44,547
Oh, God.

781
01:04:44,631 --> 01:04:49,051
One of the greatest medical advances
of all time.

782
01:04:50,845 --> 01:04:52,013
I can't tell you.

783
01:04:53,640 --> 01:04:54,682
Come on.

784
01:04:54,766 --> 01:04:59,186
I'm talking about Stockholm.
Next year, the three of us together.

785
01:04:59,771 --> 01:05:01,355
I'm talking Nobel-fucking-Prize!

786
01:05:01,439 --> 01:05:02,398
Oh, my God.

787
01:05:02,482 --> 01:05:05,317
Sorry, kid, I'm going to get there first!

788
01:05:06,027 --> 01:05:08,362
Wait! I got something for you to celebrate!

789
01:05:08,572 --> 01:05:10,781
Oh, no! What is that?

790
01:05:11,825 --> 01:05:13,158
One for you.

791
01:05:13,243 --> 01:05:14,827
Oh, my God.

792
01:05:15,620 --> 01:05:18,289
- These go with that one.
- Oh, God, Nathan.

793
01:05:18,832 --> 01:05:21,834
Oh, Nathan! What a beautiful dress!

794
01:05:21,918 --> 01:05:23,252
Do you like it?

795
01:05:27,841 --> 01:05:29,174
Try it on.

796
01:05:30,176 --> 01:05:32,011
Put it on. Come on, let's get dressed.
Try it on!

797
01:05:32,095 --> 01:05:33,262
Oh, Nathan!

798
01:05:33,346 --> 01:05:34,346
Come on! Come on, come on, come on.

799
01:05:34,389 --> 01:05:36,348
- Could I go...
- Into the bushes! Into the bushes!

800
01:05:36,433 --> 01:05:39,184
Come on. Try it on.
Please, I want to see it.

801
01:05:39,311 --> 01:05:40,603
- Nathan, I'm not going to do that.
- I wanna see it.

802
01:05:40,687 --> 01:05:42,646
I just want to see it on you!

803
01:05:42,731 --> 01:05:44,273
All right, hold it up.

804
01:05:45,900 --> 01:05:47,067
It doesn't have a top.

805
01:05:47,152 --> 01:05:48,235
You're the top.

806
01:05:48,403 --> 01:05:50,404
Nathan, it's beautiful!

807
01:05:52,449 --> 01:05:53,574
I have to get back to the laboratory.

808
01:05:53,658 --> 01:05:56,243
Why don't you stay
and have some lunch with us?

809
01:05:56,328 --> 01:05:57,286
Tonight we'll celebrate.

810
01:05:57,370 --> 01:05:58,370
Look at all this that I have here.

811
01:05:58,455 --> 01:06:01,165
I know. I can't, I can't.
I got to get back to work.

812
01:06:01,249 --> 01:06:02,750
Tonight we'll celebrate.

813
01:06:02,834 --> 01:06:04,418
Make sure Sophie gets home safe, okay?

814
01:06:04,544 --> 01:06:06,003
I want to see you in those clothes tonight.

815
01:06:06,087 --> 01:06:07,630
Look at these shoes!

816
01:06:07,714 --> 01:06:09,381
Tonight. Tonight I'll look at it.

817
01:06:11,384 --> 01:06:14,094
Oh, my darling, I'm so proud of you.

818
01:06:18,266 --> 01:06:19,558
Tonight.

819
01:06:20,852 --> 01:06:24,229
You were the one
who gave me the idea to get it.

820
01:06:25,181 --> 01:06:26,440
It's like mine.

821
01:06:26,524 --> 01:06:28,692
It's a beautiful watch, yes?

822
01:06:30,528 --> 01:06:33,405
Dr. Kats, my boss, you know, his wife.

823
01:06:34,032 --> 01:06:35,991
Her family is in the jewelry business,

824
01:06:36,076 --> 01:06:37,951
so he took me over there in the car

825
01:06:38,536 --> 01:06:39,578
to get it engraved.

826
01:06:39,663 --> 01:06:41,080
It probably opens at the top, like mine.

827
01:06:41,164 --> 01:06:43,624
What? Don't get your fingers...

828
01:06:43,708 --> 01:06:45,125
You got your fingerprints all over it.

829
01:06:45,210 --> 01:06:46,585
I got nothing on that.

830
01:06:46,670 --> 01:06:48,545
Anyway, you think he will like that?

831
01:06:48,630 --> 01:06:49,630
Sure, he will.

832
01:06:49,923 --> 01:06:52,257
Yeah, I think he will be very pleased.

833
01:06:55,345 --> 01:06:59,598
It cost a great deal of money,
more than I could afford.

834
01:06:59,683 --> 01:07:01,642
Anyway, who cares?

835
01:07:02,519 --> 01:07:04,687
Today, money doesn't seem very important.

836
01:07:06,981 --> 01:07:09,024
Get the champagne! Quick.

837
01:07:14,239 --> 01:07:16,448
This light... Get them!

838
01:07:16,533 --> 01:07:18,867
- I got it!
- Champagne is in the back!

839
01:07:18,993 --> 01:07:22,079
I couldn't remember Nathan's brand
when I went to the store.

840
01:07:22,163 --> 01:07:23,330
Yeah? What kind?

841
01:07:23,415 --> 01:07:26,208
The guy at the shop said something Rosé.

842
01:07:26,292 --> 01:07:28,127
The guy at the shop said it's very good.

843
01:07:31,715 --> 01:07:34,133
- Surprise!
- Surprise!

844
01:07:34,509 --> 01:07:37,386
Is this the brand you said you liked?
I couldn't remember.

845
01:07:42,016 --> 01:07:44,309
Stingo got you that champagne.

846
01:07:45,395 --> 01:07:46,478
Yeah.

847
01:07:47,021 --> 01:07:48,480
That's sweet.

848
01:07:49,399 --> 01:07:51,608
It's beautiful. Look at you.

849
01:07:51,735 --> 01:07:52,985
Yeah, do you like?

850
01:07:53,069 --> 01:07:54,069
Very becoming.

851
01:07:55,155 --> 01:07:57,489
Fidelity would become you more.

852
01:07:59,159 --> 01:08:00,159
What?

853
01:08:01,327 --> 01:08:05,289
Haven't I told you that the only thing
I absolutely demand of you,

854
01:08:05,957 --> 01:08:09,084
the only single thing is fidelity?

855
01:08:11,254 --> 01:08:15,090
And didn't I tell you that
if you ever were with this guy Kats

856
01:08:15,717 --> 01:08:17,259
ever again outside of work,

857
01:08:17,343 --> 01:08:20,929
that if you ever so much as walked 10 feet
with this cheap schmuck, this fraud,

858
01:08:21,055 --> 01:08:22,598
- that I would break your ass?
- Yeah, but...

859
01:08:22,682 --> 01:08:23,807
And this afternoon,

860
01:08:23,850 --> 01:08:25,768
- he brings you home again in his car.
- Yeah, but...

861
01:08:25,852 --> 01:08:29,104
You spent the whole fucking afternoon with him,
didn't you? Didn't you?

862
01:08:29,189 --> 01:08:32,065
Or should I say, you spent
the whole afternoon with him fucking?

863
01:08:32,150 --> 01:08:33,192
Nathan...

864
01:08:33,276 --> 01:08:34,894
Did you try on your new dress for him?

865
01:08:36,196 --> 01:08:39,072
So he could strip it off you
in a cheap hotel room?

866
01:08:39,157 --> 01:08:42,284
Did he line up your vertebrae
in a nice neat line

867
01:08:42,368 --> 01:08:43,577
while he was humping you?

868
01:08:43,661 --> 01:08:46,955
I bet he does quite a number with that
fast chiropractor's dick of his, huh?

869
01:08:47,081 --> 01:08:48,582
- No. Wait! Nathan!
- Come on, you can tell me.

870
01:08:49,167 --> 01:08:51,376
How do you know he took her home?
What have you been doing?

871
01:08:51,461 --> 01:08:52,461
You were following her all afternoon?

872
01:08:52,545 --> 01:08:53,545
Stingo...

873
01:08:53,630 --> 01:08:56,548
What if you find out
why Kats took her home?

874
01:08:57,342 --> 01:08:58,884
I think you're going to feel like a fool.

875
01:08:58,968 --> 01:09:00,469
Just find out why he took her home.

876
01:09:00,553 --> 01:09:02,054
Please, don't!

877
01:09:03,289 --> 01:09:07,893
Our baby Southern artiste
defending a little Polack whore.

878
01:09:09,938 --> 01:09:13,941
Too bad our celebration will be
of more mundane stripe than I had intended.

879
01:09:14,025 --> 01:09:15,651
Stingo, I think that you should go...

880
01:09:15,735 --> 01:09:17,319
I'm not going to leave you alone with him.

881
01:09:17,403 --> 01:09:19,112
You don't understand,
you're making it worse by being here.

882
01:09:19,197 --> 01:09:20,739
No! He's not going to get away
with this shit!

883
01:09:20,824 --> 01:09:22,366
You don't understand him.

884
01:09:22,450 --> 01:09:24,326
Let's just cut out all the ugly shit!

885
01:09:24,410 --> 01:09:26,745
Yeah, pour this. Let's celebrate.
You know what?

886
01:09:27,580 --> 01:09:28,622
We're here to toast you.

887
01:09:28,706 --> 01:09:30,374
But what are we doing here?
What are we here to toast?

888
01:09:30,458 --> 01:09:31,542
You're right. You're right.
I'm terribly sorry.

889
01:09:31,626 --> 01:09:32,626
That's all right.

890
01:09:32,710 --> 01:09:34,419
I don't know what's come over me.

891
01:09:37,048 --> 01:09:39,466
Here is to my best friend

892
01:09:41,094 --> 01:09:42,636
- and my best girl.
- There we go.

893
01:09:42,929 --> 01:09:45,722
Here, yeah.
Look what I got you, anyway.

894
01:09:50,436 --> 01:09:52,771
I had the wrapping, but...

895
01:09:55,942 --> 01:09:58,277
It's beautiful. That's really beautiful.

896
01:09:58,361 --> 01:09:59,361
Do you like it?

897
01:09:59,445 --> 01:10:01,947
I like it? Like it? I love it.

898
01:10:02,031 --> 01:10:05,117
Yes. It's just like Stingo's.

899
01:10:05,994 --> 01:10:07,202
It is?

900
01:10:08,705 --> 01:10:09,746
Oh, yeah.

901
01:10:09,831 --> 01:10:11,373
It has an engraving.

902
01:10:11,457 --> 01:10:13,000
It's beautiful. Beautiful.

903
01:10:16,963 --> 01:10:19,798
This toast is in honor

904
01:10:20,550 --> 01:10:26,013
of my complete disassociation
from you two creeps.

905
01:10:26,180 --> 01:10:27,723
Disassociation from you,

906
01:10:28,516 --> 01:10:31,602
the coony chiropractic cunt of Kings County,

907
01:10:31,686 --> 01:10:34,479
and you, the dreary dregs of Dixie.

908
01:10:38,651 --> 01:10:41,153
You've not fooled me, young Stingo.

909
01:10:42,030 --> 01:10:46,325
Since you so graciously allowed me
to read your magnum Southern opus,

910
01:10:47,327 --> 01:10:50,662
your puling, adolescent self-pity

911
01:10:51,414 --> 01:10:53,206
for your poor dead mother.

912
01:10:53,291 --> 01:10:54,917
Knock it off, Nathan.

913
01:10:55,251 --> 01:10:58,211
However, look on it optimistically.

914
01:10:58,296 --> 01:11:00,923
You might be on the verge
of a whole new form,

915
01:11:01,007 --> 01:11:03,091
the Southern comic book.

916
01:11:04,302 --> 01:11:05,469
And now, my sweet, my sweet.

917
01:11:05,553 --> 01:11:06,678
Stingo...

918
01:11:06,763 --> 01:11:10,766
I want to ask you one question
that's been burning in my mind for so long.

919
01:11:10,850 --> 01:11:14,019
Yeah, well, maybe you can explain
something to me.

920
01:11:14,479 --> 01:11:18,440
The reason maybe of why you are here.

921
01:11:18,524 --> 01:11:19,733
Wait...

922
01:11:20,318 --> 01:11:24,821
Walking these streets drenched
in enticing perfumery...

923
01:11:26,699 --> 01:11:29,785
engaged in surreptitious venery

924
01:11:30,536 --> 01:11:34,331
with not one, but two.

925
01:11:34,415 --> 01:11:37,292
Count them, ladies and gentlemen.

926
01:11:38,252 --> 01:11:41,046
Two chiropractors.

927
01:11:41,172 --> 01:11:45,801
In short, making hay while the sun shines,

928
01:11:45,885 --> 01:11:48,512
to employ an old bromide,

929
01:11:48,596 --> 01:11:50,013
while at Auschwitz,

930
01:11:50,098 --> 01:11:53,850
the ghosts of the millions of the dead
still seek an answer.

931
01:11:53,935 --> 01:11:55,018
No.

932
01:11:56,062 --> 01:11:57,396
Tell me.

933
01:11:58,272 --> 01:11:59,523
Tell me, Sophie.

934
01:11:59,691 --> 01:12:01,084
The same anti-Semitism

935
01:12:02,068 --> 01:12:05,070
for which Poland has gained
such worldwide renown,

936
01:12:05,154 --> 01:12:08,573
did a similar anti-Semitism
guide your own destiny,

937
01:12:08,658 --> 01:12:10,826
help you along,
protect you in a manner of speaking,

938
01:12:10,910 --> 01:12:14,079
so that you became one of the
minuscule handful of people who lived

939
01:12:14,872 --> 01:12:17,332
while the millions died?

940
01:12:19,127 --> 01:12:21,712
Tell me. Tell me why.

941
01:12:23,423 --> 01:12:25,841
Explanation, please!

942
01:12:27,260 --> 01:12:32,431
Tell me why, old lucky number 11379.

943
01:12:33,141 --> 01:12:39,479
Tell me why you inhabit
the land of the living.

944
01:12:39,564 --> 01:12:42,816
What splendid little tricks and stratagem

945
01:12:42,900 --> 01:12:44,776
sprang from that lovely head of yours

946
01:12:44,861 --> 01:12:48,488
to allow you to breath
the clear Polish air,

947
01:12:49,240 --> 01:12:55,662
while the multitudes at Auschwitz
choked slowly on the gas?

948
01:12:55,747 --> 01:12:56,705
No!

949
01:12:56,789 --> 01:12:57,748
Explain!

950
01:12:57,874 --> 01:12:59,458
- Stop it!
- Explain!

951
01:12:59,542 --> 01:13:00,709
Lay off of her!

952
01:13:00,793 --> 01:13:02,335
Get out of my way!

953
01:13:02,420 --> 01:13:04,629
Get out of my...

954
01:13:06,090 --> 01:13:08,383
Stay away! Stay out!

955
01:13:09,302 --> 01:13:11,636
Stay out! Get out of here!

956
01:13:11,846 --> 01:13:13,221
Go away!

957
01:13:16,350 --> 01:13:18,393
I'm leaving the house, they're here.

958
01:13:18,478 --> 01:13:21,855
I come back, two empty rooms.
No Nathan, no Sophie.

959
01:13:21,939 --> 01:13:23,190
And the last anybody knows,

960
01:13:23,274 --> 01:13:25,901
he puts her in a cab
and he runs off the other way.

961
01:13:25,985 --> 01:13:27,402
I can't tell you how hurt I was.

962
01:13:27,487 --> 01:13:29,071
- Is this Dr. Blackstock?
- <i>Yes.</i>

963
01:13:29,155 --> 01:13:31,865
Listen, I'm a friend of Sophie Zawistowska's,

964
01:13:31,949 --> 01:13:33,658
and you may have heard, I'm Stingo.

965
01:13:33,743 --> 01:13:36,578
<i>Oh, the writer!
Sophie's very proud of you.</i>

966
01:13:36,662 --> 01:13:39,289
Yeah. Listen, I'm trying to track her down.

967
01:13:39,373 --> 01:13:41,208
<i>But don't you live in the same house?</i>

968
01:13:42,375 --> 01:13:43,627
She moved out last night.

969
01:13:43,711 --> 01:13:44,753
<i>Moved out?</i>

970
01:13:44,837 --> 01:13:46,755
<i>When she called in this morning,
she wasn't well.</i>

971
01:13:46,839 --> 01:13:50,258
<i>I was worried about her.
She's such a darling girl.</i>

972
01:13:50,343 --> 01:13:52,844
Listen, do you have any idea
how I can find her?

973
01:13:52,929 --> 01:13:54,888
<i>What about the boyfriend?</i>

974
01:13:56,348 --> 01:13:57,574
I think that's over.

975
01:13:58,059 --> 01:13:59,935
<i>Maybe she went to stay with a friend.</i>

976
01:14:01,854 --> 01:14:03,688
I don't know any friends of hers.

977
01:14:04,023 --> 01:14:08,777
<i>There was this Polish girl
who worked for a professor at Brooklyn College.</i>

978
01:14:08,861 --> 01:14:12,072
<i>I remember her name.
It was Sonja Wajinska.</i>

979
01:14:12,782 --> 01:14:16,201
Does a woman named Sonja Wajinska work here?

980
01:14:16,494 --> 01:14:19,830
No, I am sorry.
She went back to Poland six months ago.

981
01:14:19,914 --> 01:14:22,415
But if you like,
I can give you her address.

982
01:14:22,500 --> 01:14:23,959
Thank you.

983
01:14:24,043 --> 01:14:27,003
You don't happen to know a friend of hers,
Sophie Zawistowska, do you?

984
01:14:27,088 --> 01:14:28,255
Yes.

985
01:14:28,631 --> 01:14:30,882
She came here once to visit Sonja,

986
01:14:30,967 --> 01:14:33,176
but she did not come back again.

987
01:14:34,762 --> 01:14:39,808
I recognized her from my days
at the University of Krakow.

988
01:14:40,101 --> 01:14:43,061
She is the daughter of Professor Bieganski.

989
01:14:43,146 --> 01:14:44,396
Were you a student of his?

990
01:14:46,607 --> 01:14:49,484
I heard him lecture once.
That was enough.

991
01:14:50,736 --> 01:14:54,072
I know that he was very outspoken
about the Nazis.

992
01:14:55,158 --> 01:14:57,284
He was crazy about the Nazis.

993
01:14:58,077 --> 01:15:01,371
I think because they hated Jews
as much as he did.

994
01:15:02,415 --> 01:15:04,207
The Nazis killed him.

995
01:15:05,042 --> 01:15:09,045
They came one day and made a clean sweep
of all academics.

996
01:15:09,755 --> 01:15:13,341
And they didn't stop
to check their political convictions.

997
01:15:13,426 --> 01:15:15,177
I think you have the wrong man.

998
01:15:16,137 --> 01:15:19,139
Look, I shall show you.

999
01:15:27,690 --> 01:15:29,399
Bieganski.

1000
01:15:32,695 --> 01:15:35,155
Look, Bieganski,

1001
01:15:35,615 --> 01:15:39,451
professor of law at the University of Krakow

1002
01:15:39,827 --> 01:15:42,787
from 1919 to 1939,

1003
01:15:43,581 --> 01:15:46,625
known for his anti-Semitic tracts.

1004
01:15:47,501 --> 01:15:51,213
A major promulgator of the ghetto bench rule,

1005
01:15:51,297 --> 01:15:57,594
which made it illegal for Jewish students
to sit on the same bench as Poles.

1006
01:15:58,554 --> 01:16:00,013
So.

1007
01:16:01,307 --> 01:16:03,600
Astrid, your mother's on the phone.

1008
01:16:03,684 --> 01:16:05,810
<i>I told Yetta I was leaving.</i>

1009
01:16:07,980 --> 01:16:11,775
<i>A few weeks before,
I had received a letter from my father.</i>

1010
01:16:12,276 --> 01:16:14,527
<i>He had inherited a small farm,</i>

1011
01:16:14,612 --> 01:16:16,821
<i>and knowing I was running out of money,</i>

1012
01:16:16,906 --> 01:16:20,033
<i>proposed that I come back South
and live on it.</i>

1013
01:16:20,785 --> 01:16:23,119
<i>I could not bear to stay in Brooklyn.</i>

1014
01:16:23,871 --> 01:16:26,081
Come down, your mother's waiting.

1015
01:16:26,165 --> 01:16:28,625
All right, already. I'm coming.

1016
01:16:35,591 --> 01:16:37,092
Hello!

1017
01:16:41,013 --> 01:16:42,597
Hello!

1018
01:16:42,723 --> 01:16:45,267
Sophie, you're back.

1019
01:16:45,559 --> 01:16:47,894
Oh, yes, hello, Yetta.

1020
01:16:49,355 --> 01:16:51,690
I came to get the rest of my things.

1021
01:16:52,024 --> 01:16:54,276
Have you heard from Nathan?

1022
01:16:54,360 --> 01:16:56,611
No. Not a word.

1023
01:16:56,946 --> 01:17:00,865
Just sent some mover this morning
to get the rest of his things.

1024
01:17:01,701 --> 01:17:02,784
Okay.

1025
01:17:04,537 --> 01:17:06,079
Okay.

1026
01:17:09,625 --> 01:17:10,834
Stingo?

1027
01:17:14,839 --> 01:17:15,964
Yeah.

1028
01:17:29,937 --> 01:17:33,440
I'm sorry about what happened last night,
you know that.

1029
01:17:33,524 --> 01:17:39,487
I want you to know that Nathan didn't mean
what he said about your book.

1030
01:17:43,993 --> 01:17:46,077
Well, you know that. Right?

1031
01:17:48,456 --> 01:17:51,207
I know he really loves your writing.

1032
01:17:52,918 --> 01:17:55,545
Look, that doesn't matter anymore.

1033
01:18:02,094 --> 01:18:07,515
But, I mean, we will still be friends.

1034
01:18:11,687 --> 01:18:14,773
You know, I'm leaving.
I'm going home.

1035
01:18:17,151 --> 01:18:19,861
It should be a better place for me to write.

1036
01:18:20,946 --> 01:18:23,365
We have driven you away.

1037
01:18:24,617 --> 01:18:26,618
It has nothing to do with you.

1038
01:18:39,673 --> 01:18:42,008
I spoke with Dr. Blackstock today.

1039
01:18:47,932 --> 01:18:50,934
Oh, Stingo, did you go looking for me there?

1040
01:18:51,477 --> 01:18:53,937
I would've left you a note
where I went,

1041
01:18:54,021 --> 01:18:58,108
but I just didn't think of it. I'm sorry.

1042
01:19:00,486 --> 01:19:02,487
I'm sorry you worried about me.

1043
01:19:05,032 --> 01:19:08,493
He seemed to think that your friend Sonja
might know where you were.

1044
01:19:09,829 --> 01:19:14,207
Sonja? Sonja Wajinska?
But she went back to Poland.

1045
01:19:15,167 --> 01:19:16,876
Yeah, I know that.

1046
01:19:19,004 --> 01:19:21,131
I went over to the Brooklyn College.

1047
01:19:25,511 --> 01:19:27,679
She used to work
for a language professor there.

1048
01:19:27,763 --> 01:19:28,888
Yes.

1049
01:19:33,519 --> 01:19:35,562
I think you met him once.

1050
01:19:40,734 --> 01:19:42,444
He knew your father.

1051
01:19:45,197 --> 01:19:47,073
Yeah, my father.

1052
01:19:53,664 --> 01:19:55,957
He heard him lecture once

1053
01:19:57,042 --> 01:20:00,128
at the University of Krakow which, I believe,
is where your father taught.

1054
01:20:00,212 --> 01:20:03,673
Yeah, if he told you,
then he told you about my father.

1055
01:20:05,217 --> 01:20:07,177
Sophie, why did you lie to me?

1056
01:20:11,515 --> 01:20:17,228
Yeah, I lied because, you know why?
I was so afraid.

1057
01:20:18,105 --> 01:20:20,773
I was afraid I would be left alone!

1058
01:20:24,403 --> 01:20:25,737
So...

1059
01:20:39,919 --> 01:20:43,171
Goodbye, my friend.

1060
01:21:24,004 --> 01:21:26,297
Sophie, I want to understand.

1061
01:21:32,846 --> 01:21:34,931
I'd like to know the truth.

1062
01:21:37,476 --> 01:21:38,977
The truth

1063
01:21:40,980 --> 01:21:44,315
does not make it easier to understand,
you know.

1064
01:21:48,112 --> 01:21:53,491
I mean, you think that you find out
the truth about me,

1065
01:21:53,576 --> 01:21:58,037
and then you'll understand me
and then you'd forgive me for all those...

1066
01:22:00,541 --> 01:22:02,333
For all my lies.

1067
01:22:04,336 --> 01:22:06,713
I promise I'll never leave you.

1068
01:22:08,173 --> 01:22:09,924
You must never promise that.

1069
01:22:11,093 --> 01:22:14,846
No one, no one should ever promise that.

1070
01:22:24,189 --> 01:22:25,565
Oh, the truth.

1071
01:22:25,649 --> 01:22:28,776
The truth. I don't even know
what is the truth.

1072
01:22:32,698 --> 01:22:35,366
After all these lies I have told.

1073
01:22:50,507 --> 01:22:52,050
My father.

1074
01:23:01,852 --> 01:23:06,022
<i>How can I explain
how much I loved my father?</i>

1075
01:23:12,571 --> 01:23:17,700
<i>My father believed that human perfection
was a possibility.</i>

1076
01:23:19,912 --> 01:23:23,831
<i>Every night I pray to God
to forgive me</i>

1077
01:23:23,916 --> 01:23:27,502
<i>for always making a disappointment
to my father.</i>

1078
01:23:29,588 --> 01:23:31,255
And I pray to him

1079
01:23:32,341 --> 01:23:36,511
to make me worthy of such a great,
good man.

1080
01:23:40,766 --> 01:23:42,183
<i>I was a grown woman.</i>

1081
01:23:43,560 --> 01:23:45,937
<i>I was fully come of age.</i>

1082
01:23:46,480 --> 01:23:48,564
<i>I was a married woman</i>

1083
01:23:48,649 --> 01:23:53,111
<i>when I realized that I hate my father
beyond all words to tell it.</i>

1084
01:23:56,281 --> 01:24:00,785
<i>It was winter of 1938.</i>

1085
01:24:02,663 --> 01:24:07,709
<i>And my father was working for weeks
on the speech he calls</i>

1086
01:24:08,711 --> 01:24:11,462
<i>"Poland Jewish Problem."</i>

1087
01:24:14,466 --> 01:24:17,176
<i>Ordinarily I typed those speeches</i>

1088
01:24:17,261 --> 01:24:19,971
<i>and I don't hear to the words,
to their meaning.</i>

1089
01:24:20,055 --> 01:24:26,227
<i>But this time I came upon a word,
repeats several times,</i>

1090
01:24:26,311 --> 01:24:28,479
<i>that I have never heard before.</i>

1091
01:24:39,032 --> 01:24:42,201
<i>The solution for Poland Jewish Problem,</i>

1092
01:24:42,661 --> 01:24:46,205
<i>he concludes, is</i> die Vernichtung.

1093
01:24:50,335 --> 01:24:51,878
<i>Extermination.</i>

1094
01:24:55,132 --> 01:24:59,469
<i>I had not meant to go
to the ghetto that afternoon,</i>

1095
01:24:59,553 --> 01:25:02,305
<i>but something made me go there.</i>

1096
01:25:04,016 --> 01:25:06,642
<i>I stood there,
I don't know how long,</i>

1097
01:25:06,727 --> 01:25:10,855
<i>watching these people
that my father has condemned to die.</i>

1098
01:25:12,691 --> 01:25:14,442
<i>For all these men, these women,</i>

1099
01:25:14,526 --> 01:25:17,361
<i>these children,</i> die Vernichtung.

1100
01:25:19,865 --> 01:25:21,365
<i>Extermination.</i>

1101
01:25:23,368 --> 01:25:26,454
I suddenly remembered that my father
is waiting for that speech,

1102
01:25:26,538 --> 01:25:29,791
and I hurry home to finish the typing,

1103
01:25:29,875 --> 01:25:35,671
but in my rushing and my haste
to finish that,

1104
01:25:36,256 --> 01:25:40,051
I make so many mistakes in the sentences.

1105
01:25:41,986 --> 01:25:43,971
And I run with it to the university,

1106
01:25:44,056 --> 01:25:48,476
and my father has no time to check that
before speaking.

1107
01:25:48,560 --> 01:25:53,481
And he get up in front of all those people,
and he reads the speech

1108
01:25:53,565 --> 01:25:58,986
and make those mistakes
and I see him getting so angry.

1109
01:26:00,155 --> 01:26:02,949
And when it was over,
he came up to me.

1110
01:26:04,076 --> 01:26:06,828
I was with my husband, of course.

1111
01:26:08,288 --> 01:26:11,916
And in front of him
and all his colleagues he said,

1112
01:26:13,710 --> 01:26:20,091
"Zosia, your intelligence is pulp."

1113
01:26:23,470 --> 01:26:24,762
Pulp.

1114
01:26:27,683 --> 01:26:30,017
I did not have any courage to say,

1115
01:26:30,102 --> 01:26:32,436
"Yes, but what about the Jews?"

1116
01:26:33,355 --> 01:26:35,439
The Jewish people, but...

1117
01:26:38,652 --> 01:26:43,781
After that, he didn't trust me anyway.
And neither did my husband.

1118
01:26:57,796 --> 01:27:00,047
After that in Warsaw,

1119
01:27:01,550 --> 01:27:03,301
I had a lover

1120
01:27:04,553 --> 01:27:07,013
who was very, very good to me.

1121
01:27:09,182 --> 01:27:10,641
You must help us, Sophie.

1122
01:27:11,810 --> 01:27:13,561
Stop torturing her.

1123
01:27:13,645 --> 01:27:17,523
<i>Jozef lived with his half-sister Wanda.</i>

1124
01:27:17,608 --> 01:27:19,984
<i>She was a leader in the Resistance.</i>

1125
01:27:21,153 --> 01:27:22,236
Sophie!

1126
01:27:23,739 --> 01:27:25,156
What is that?

1127
01:27:26,074 --> 01:27:30,328
It's a photo of children rejected
from the Germanization program.

1128
01:27:30,787 --> 01:27:32,997
The "Lebensborn" program.

1129
01:27:33,665 --> 01:27:35,207
These are children

1130
01:27:35,667 --> 01:27:37,960
taken from Polish parents

1131
01:27:39,171 --> 01:27:41,130
who, at first, were believed

1132
01:27:41,673 --> 01:27:44,550
to have Aryan racial features.

1133
01:27:45,093 --> 01:27:47,303
They were to be taken to Germany

1134
01:27:47,721 --> 01:27:49,847
and raised as Germans.

1135
01:27:51,183 --> 01:27:53,935
But, at some point, it was decided

1136
01:27:54,186 --> 01:27:57,229
that they were racially unsuitable.

1137
01:27:57,689 --> 01:27:59,148
Unsuitable!

1138
01:28:02,694 --> 01:28:04,987
That's why they were consigned

1139
01:28:06,573 --> 01:28:08,407
for disposal.

1140
01:28:09,534 --> 01:28:14,455
All we ask of you is to translate
some stolen Gestapo documents.

1141
01:28:14,873 --> 01:28:16,374
I can't.

1142
01:28:17,167 --> 01:28:19,752
I cannot endanger my children.

1143
01:28:20,128 --> 01:28:22,296
Your children could be next.

1144
01:28:25,342 --> 01:28:29,053
No. No. I do not want to get involved.

1145
01:28:35,352 --> 01:28:40,064
<i>Two weeks later,
the Gestapo killed Jozef.</i>

1146
01:28:41,733 --> 01:28:43,484
<i>They cut his throat.</i>

1147
01:28:45,862 --> 01:28:47,697
They had courage.

1148
01:28:50,242 --> 01:28:52,743
Oh, God, they had courage.

1149
01:28:57,082 --> 01:29:01,711
<i>Not long after they killed Jozef,
I was arrested.</i>

1150
01:29:03,130 --> 01:29:06,507
<i>My children were sent with me
to Auschwitz.</i>

1151
01:29:09,803 --> 01:29:12,513
<i>When the train arrived at Auschwitz,</i>

1152
01:29:14,266 --> 01:29:17,101
<i>the Germans made the selection,</i>

1153
01:29:18,270 --> 01:29:21,022
<i>who would live and who would die.</i>

1154
01:29:23,025 --> 01:29:25,359
Jan, my little boy...

1155
01:29:51,178 --> 01:29:55,222
<i>Jan, my little boy,
was sent to the</i> Kinderlager,

1156
01:29:55,307 --> 01:29:57,767
<i>which was the children's camp.</i>

1157
01:30:02,064 --> 01:30:06,233
<i>And my little girl, Eva,
was sent to crematorium two.</i>

1158
01:30:11,281 --> 01:30:13,282
<i>She was exterminated.</i>

1159
01:30:19,331 --> 01:30:25,044
<i>Thanks to my perfect German
and my secretarial skills,</i>

1160
01:30:25,128 --> 01:30:29,673
<i>the things my father
had taught me so well,</i>

1161
01:30:31,510 --> 01:30:34,512
<i>I came to work</i>

1162
01:30:34,596 --> 01:30:40,267
<i>for</i> Reichsführer, <i>Rudolf Hoess,
Commandant of Auschwitz-Birkenau.</i>

1163
01:30:43,605 --> 01:30:47,108
<i>The day they took me to work for Hoess,</i>

1164
01:30:47,192 --> 01:30:50,194
<i>I was forced to walk past Block 25.</i>

1165
01:30:50,570 --> 01:30:52,947
<i>That is where they took the prisoners</i>

1166
01:30:53,031 --> 01:30:56,075
<i>that were selected for extermination.</i>

1167
01:30:57,244 --> 01:31:02,748
<i>The people there were made
to stand for, sometimes, days.</i>

1168
01:31:03,208 --> 01:31:06,127
<i>They were naked
and they had no water.</i>

1169
01:31:07,420 --> 01:31:13,801
<i>And their hands reached out from the bars,
and they cried and pled.</i>

1170
01:31:34,407 --> 01:31:36,907
This woman will be

1171
01:31:37,367 --> 01:31:39,577
Commandant Hoess' secretary.

1172
01:31:42,038 --> 01:31:46,000
Take her downstairs.
See that she showers thoroughly.

1173
01:31:49,087 --> 01:31:50,546
Give me your clothes.

1174
01:31:52,007 --> 01:31:53,757
Here is the shower.

1175
01:31:54,843 --> 01:31:58,804
You must use this disinfectant soap.

1176
01:31:59,806 --> 01:32:01,765
It burns and it stinks.

1177
01:32:02,100 --> 01:32:07,104
But you must use it,
because she has a good nose.

1178
01:32:12,194 --> 01:32:13,277
Shoes!

1179
01:32:14,362 --> 01:32:15,696
Put your shoes here.

1180
01:32:16,823 --> 01:32:21,327
Please don't take them.
They were a gift from my father.

1181
01:32:23,246 --> 01:32:25,623
My God, how'd you keep them
in the camp?

1182
01:32:26,124 --> 01:32:28,500
I hid them. Please...

1183
01:32:31,588 --> 01:32:34,381
If she sees them,
she'll take them away.

1184
01:32:34,633 --> 01:32:38,969
I'll clean them.
Please, they are all I have.

1185
01:32:43,558 --> 01:32:45,142
Well, all right.

1186
01:32:46,895 --> 01:32:48,488
Thank you.

1187
01:32:51,107 --> 01:32:52,483
Thank you.

1188
01:33:00,659 --> 01:33:01,659
Don't be afraid.

1189
01:33:02,994 --> 01:33:04,495
I was told you could help us.

1190
01:33:05,372 --> 01:33:07,164
Will you help the resistance?

1191
01:33:08,792 --> 01:33:10,501
But what can I do?

1192
01:33:11,169 --> 01:33:15,798
Emmi Hoess has a radio.
Her room is under her father's office

1193
01:33:16,049 --> 01:33:19,134
where you will work.
If you could get the radio,

1194
01:33:19,344 --> 01:33:24,014
bring it down here.
I could smuggle it out.

1195
01:33:24,432 --> 01:33:26,600
Sure, sure, I give you the radio,

1196
01:33:27,060 --> 01:33:31,397
you smuggle it out,
and I get shot for stealing it.

1197
01:33:32,857 --> 01:33:35,859
That's why you must make Hoess trust you.

1198
01:33:36,278 --> 01:33:37,820
But how?

1199
01:33:41,408 --> 01:33:46,036
He is a man and you are a woman...

1200
01:33:47,872 --> 01:33:49,498
Of course!

1201
01:33:50,208 --> 01:33:53,752
Bald, starving, stinking of germicides.

1202
01:33:53,920 --> 01:33:55,838
Very impressive!

1203
01:33:56,089 --> 01:33:59,174
You're wrong. You look German.

1204
01:33:59,592 --> 01:34:05,306
You speak cultured German.
You'll be working with him alone

1205
01:34:05,557 --> 01:34:07,808
and he's an unhappy man.

1206
01:34:08,226 --> 01:34:11,395
- Then do something for me.
- What?

1207
01:34:12,522 --> 01:34:13,897
You must find my son.

1208
01:34:15,233 --> 01:34:18,152
His name is Jan.
He's in the Children's Camp.

1209
01:34:19,029 --> 01:34:20,529
What do you want to know?

1210
01:34:22,699 --> 01:34:24,658
If... If he is...

1211
01:34:25,702 --> 01:34:28,078
- If he's alive, right?
- Yes.

1212
01:34:29,247 --> 01:34:30,581
I understand.

1213
01:34:31,875 --> 01:34:35,336
Maybe Hoess could arrange
to get him out.

1214
01:35:31,351 --> 01:35:34,812
I baked Himmler's favorite cake.

1215
01:35:37,190 --> 01:35:39,191
This is the new

1216
01:35:39,484 --> 01:35:41,652
secretary from the Camp.

1217
01:35:42,737 --> 01:35:44,154
Take her to the office.

1218
01:35:45,407 --> 01:35:47,408
Himmler can't stay for dinner.

1219
01:36:00,755 --> 01:36:02,423
Do you think it's deliberate?

1220
01:36:02,833 --> 01:36:04,591
Why deliberate?

1221
01:36:05,002 --> 01:36:09,730
You said the escapes,
the delays with the building upset him.

1222
01:36:10,798 --> 01:36:11,932
Enough!

1223
01:36:13,101 --> 01:36:17,354
Imagine, that idiot guard took the new girl
right into the kitchen

1224
01:36:17,497 --> 01:36:20,441
without disinfecting her.
In the kitchen!

1225
01:36:21,234 --> 01:36:23,485
- I mean, the children...
- They are perfectly healthy.

1226
01:36:24,654 --> 01:36:25,654
That's because they're well fed here.

1227
01:36:26,322 --> 01:36:28,240
What happens if we leave?

1228
01:36:31,078 --> 01:36:34,737
They will have to sacrifice
like other German children.

1229
01:36:49,679 --> 01:36:51,221
You are looking well.

1230
01:36:53,391 --> 01:36:55,434
I hardly drank

1231
01:36:57,187 --> 01:36:59,563
after I left here.

1232
01:37:00,773 --> 01:37:02,858
Can you imagine?

1233
01:37:03,735 --> 01:37:06,737
My father asked me
what kind of medicine

1234
01:37:07,280 --> 01:37:08,739
I practice here.

1235
01:37:10,492 --> 01:37:12,367
What can I tell him?

1236
01:37:13,745 --> 01:37:16,747
I perform God's work.

1237
01:37:19,250 --> 01:37:22,002
I select who shall live
and who shall die.

1238
01:37:23,755 --> 01:37:26,048
Is that not God's work?

1239
01:37:27,759 --> 01:37:33,222
You're too young to recall
what was done to Germany in defeat.

1240
01:37:33,598 --> 01:37:37,434
We cannot afford to be kind
if we are to survive.

1241
01:37:40,688 --> 01:37:43,315
There is an epidemic
in the Children's Camp.

1242
01:37:44,734 --> 01:37:48,779
No matter what we do,
they die like flies.

1243
01:37:49,822 --> 01:37:52,491
You cannot afford to be so sensitive.

1244
01:37:55,203 --> 01:37:57,788
...and lastly a trait of character

1245
01:37:58,623 --> 01:38:02,584
common to all people of southern climes,

1246
01:38:05,129 --> 01:38:07,214
a certain dullness of mind...

1247
01:38:08,800 --> 01:38:10,425
Do I speak too fast?

1248
01:38:11,636 --> 01:38:13,136
No, Commandant.

1249
01:38:16,307 --> 01:38:17,975
Excuse me.

1250
01:38:18,685 --> 01:38:20,018
I'm sorry to disturb you,

1251
01:38:21,521 --> 01:38:24,439
but I thought maybe
if you could go to Berlin

1252
01:38:24,774 --> 01:38:27,985
and explain to Himmler
how unfair his order is,

1253
01:38:28,361 --> 01:38:29,861
maybe he'd change his mind.

1254
01:38:29,989 --> 01:38:34,408
There's no appeal.
We're being transferred and that's that.

1255
01:39:03,813 --> 01:39:05,647
My pills, quick!

1256
01:39:29,172 --> 01:39:31,340
- Shall I call the doctor?
- Be quiet.

1257
01:39:31,924 --> 01:39:33,550
It's unbearable.

1258
01:39:46,272 --> 01:39:48,065
It's better now.

1259
01:39:51,194 --> 01:39:54,154
That ergotamine is a miracle.

1260
01:39:56,074 --> 01:39:58,033
I'm glad, Commandant.

1261
01:40:13,800 --> 01:40:15,258
Sit down.

1262
01:40:29,732 --> 01:40:31,775
How did you come here?

1263
01:40:31,984 --> 01:40:37,030
Not many prisoners
are lucky enough to find such work.

1264
01:40:39,867 --> 01:40:41,243
I think

1265
01:40:42,453 --> 01:40:44,621
it must have been fate.

1266
01:40:50,044 --> 01:40:52,587
Fate brought me to you

1267
01:40:53,423 --> 01:40:56,675
because I knew only you
would understand.

1268
01:40:59,762 --> 01:41:01,096
Understand what?

1269
01:41:02,432 --> 01:41:04,683
That a mistake has been made.

1270
01:41:11,816 --> 01:41:13,775
May I show you something?

1271
01:41:16,237 --> 01:41:18,739
This is one of the earliest
Polish documents

1272
01:41:20,032 --> 01:41:23,326
suggesting a "final solution"
to the Jewish problem.

1273
01:41:23,745 --> 01:41:26,496
I helped my father to write it.

1274
01:41:27,582 --> 01:41:31,918
Perhaps you will realize
the injustice of my imprisonment.

1275
01:41:35,882 --> 01:41:37,466
So, you claim you are innocent.

1276
01:41:38,092 --> 01:41:42,679
Sir, I freely admit my guilt
of the minor charge

1277
01:41:43,055 --> 01:41:45,265
which caused me to be sent here.

1278
01:41:48,686 --> 01:41:53,273
I only ask that this misdemeanor
be compared to my record,

1279
01:41:54,358 --> 01:41:58,028
not only as a Polish sympathizer
with National Socialism,

1280
01:41:58,780 --> 01:42:04,075
but as an active campaigner
in the sacred war against the Jews.

1281
01:42:04,994 --> 01:42:09,039
That pamphlet in your hand, Commandant,
will prove my point.

1282
01:42:09,582 --> 01:42:13,794
I implore you. You have the power
to give clemency and freedom.

1283
01:42:14,587 --> 01:42:15,879
Please...

1284
01:42:19,884 --> 01:42:24,471
You forget you are a Pole and, therefore,
an enemy of the Reich,

1285
01:42:25,181 --> 01:42:27,265
and that you always will be

1286
01:42:27,850 --> 01:42:30,227
even if you are not guilty of a crime.

1287
01:42:48,079 --> 01:42:51,331
You've been flirting shamelessly with me.

1288
01:42:53,125 --> 01:42:55,961
It's hard to believe you're Polish

1289
01:42:57,171 --> 01:43:00,173
with your perfect German
and the way you look,

1290
01:43:00,800 --> 01:43:04,594
your fair skin,
the structure of your face.

1291
01:43:07,431 --> 01:43:09,307
So typically Aryan.

1292
01:43:15,982 --> 01:43:19,609
You are an unusually attractive woman.

1293
01:43:23,281 --> 01:43:26,658
There is something
about certain Aryan women,

1294
01:43:29,537 --> 01:43:32,080
a pure and radiant beauty,

1295
01:43:32,999 --> 01:43:34,624
fair of skin

1296
01:43:36,460 --> 01:43:38,545
and fair of hair,

1297
01:43:41,883 --> 01:43:43,884
that inspires me

1298
01:43:44,677 --> 01:43:47,512
to idolize that beauty.

1299
01:44:18,711 --> 01:44:20,128
Wait.

1300
01:44:34,518 --> 01:44:37,187
Your pardon, sir.
A question from Frau Hoess, sir.

1301
01:44:38,356 --> 01:44:42,359
As the child just recovered from the flu,
madam wishes to know

1302
01:44:42,568 --> 01:44:47,280
if, in your view, Iphigenie is well enough
to go to a matinee

1303
01:44:47,531 --> 01:44:50,408
or should she consult Dr. Schmidt?

1304
01:44:51,452 --> 01:44:54,704
If Frau Hoess thinks she's well enough
to go to a matinee,

1305
01:44:55,122 --> 01:44:58,458
then I expect she's well enough
to go to a matinee!

1306
01:45:29,073 --> 01:45:32,617
I would risk a great deal
to have relations with you.

1307
01:45:35,204 --> 01:45:38,081
If I were not leaving,
I'd take that risk.

1308
01:45:40,209 --> 01:45:44,462
But I must go. And so must you.

1309
01:45:45,256 --> 01:45:49,884
I'm sending you back to Block 3.
You will go tomorrow.

1310
01:46:00,062 --> 01:46:04,024
Commandant, I know
I can't ask much for myself

1311
01:46:04,483 --> 01:46:06,985
and that you must follow the rules.

1312
01:46:09,697 --> 01:46:13,783
But I beg you to do one thing for me
before you send me back.

1313
01:46:14,618 --> 01:46:18,580
I have a young son in the Camp.
His name is Jan.

1314
01:46:20,916 --> 01:46:24,335
Jan Zawistowski. He is 10 years old.

1315
01:46:26,380 --> 01:46:28,798
I am afraid for his health.

1316
01:46:29,383 --> 01:46:33,136
I beg you to consider
some way to release him.

1317
01:46:33,888 --> 01:46:36,389
He is frail, and so very young.

1318
01:46:40,394 --> 01:46:41,644
Please.

1319
01:46:42,271 --> 01:46:46,900
If I have impressed you, even slightly,
with my presence,

1320
01:46:47,318 --> 01:46:49,903
I beg you to do this for me,

1321
01:46:51,697 --> 01:46:55,116
not to release me,
just free my little boy. Please.

1322
01:46:56,243 --> 01:46:59,913
You think you could get me
to contravene regulations

1323
01:47:00,372 --> 01:47:03,917
because I showed some little affection?
It's disgusting.

1324
01:47:05,169 --> 01:47:10,673
There is a legal way!
There is the "Lebensborn" program.

1325
01:47:11,133 --> 01:47:13,301
He is a perfect candidate for it.

1326
01:47:13,803 --> 01:47:18,556
You could move my child from the Camp
into the "Lebensborn" program.

1327
01:47:18,974 --> 01:47:22,685
Send him to the Reich
to be raised as a good German.

1328
01:47:23,354 --> 01:47:27,440
He is blond and looks German

1329
01:47:28,025 --> 01:47:30,652
and speaks perfect German as I do.

1330
01:47:32,655 --> 01:47:36,032
Don't you see how my little boy, Jan,

1331
01:47:36,534 --> 01:47:39,327
would be so right for "Lebensborn"?

1332
01:47:47,211 --> 01:47:50,004
I will have your son
brought here tomorrow.

1333
01:47:50,422 --> 01:47:53,091
You will see him
and then I will arrange

1334
01:47:53,218 --> 01:47:55,052
for him to be removed from the Camp.

1335
01:48:49,440 --> 01:48:52,317
You have no business in this room.

1336
01:48:53,986 --> 01:48:56,070
I'm sorry, miss, I was only...

1337
01:48:56,739 --> 01:49:01,075
You came to steal that radio.
You were about to pick it up.

1338
01:49:01,410 --> 01:49:02,744
I'll tell my father.

1339
01:49:03,287 --> 01:49:05,622
He will have you punished.

1340
01:49:08,459 --> 01:49:11,628
I was only going to look at it.
I swear.

1341
01:49:12,004 --> 01:49:16,174
I've passed by here so often.
I've never seen a radio,

1342
01:49:16,884 --> 01:49:18,968
so small, so cunning.

1343
01:49:19,511 --> 01:49:22,639
I couldn't believe it really worked.
I just...

1344
01:49:23,098 --> 01:49:24,807
Liar! You wanted to steal it.

1345
01:49:25,434 --> 01:49:27,227
I knew by the look on your face.

1346
01:49:28,562 --> 01:49:32,690
You must believe me.
I wouldn't take your radio.

1347
01:49:33,359 --> 01:49:36,486
Yes, you would. It cost 70 marks.

1348
01:49:36,904 --> 01:49:40,156
You'd listen to music in the cellar.
You're a dirty Polack!

1349
01:49:40,574 --> 01:49:44,369
Mother says Polacks are worse thieves
than Gypsies

1350
01:49:44,870 --> 01:49:46,204
and dirtier, too.

1351
01:49:47,164 --> 01:49:48,331
You stink!

1352
01:50:03,847 --> 01:50:05,014
Wake up.

1353
01:50:06,350 --> 01:50:08,393
You fainted.

1354
01:50:18,904 --> 01:50:22,282
Breathe deeply,
the cold air will revive you.

1355
01:50:26,036 --> 01:50:30,039
Keep your head flat
to get the flow of blood back.

1356
01:50:30,916 --> 01:50:34,877
The first-aid manual says
a smack will help.

1357
01:50:38,215 --> 01:50:40,842
Sit erect and lean against the bed.

1358
01:50:44,930 --> 01:50:47,724
I'll say one thing,
you're very pretty.

1359
01:50:48,100 --> 01:50:50,143
My mother said you must be Swedish.

1360
01:50:57,568 --> 01:51:01,612
Tell me, what's that design
on your dress?

1361
01:51:02,364 --> 01:51:04,407
My swimming championship badge.

1362
01:51:04,867 --> 01:51:07,577
I was class champion. I was only 8.

1363
01:51:08,746 --> 01:51:09,954
Where was that, Emmi?

1364
01:51:10,581 --> 01:51:13,541
In Dachau.
Dachau was so much nicer than Auschwitz.

1365
01:51:14,043 --> 01:51:18,338
We had a wonderful heated pool
only for officers' children.

1366
01:51:19,006 --> 01:51:20,506
I'll show you my album.

1367
01:51:35,105 --> 01:51:36,939
This is me as a baby.

1368
01:51:38,984 --> 01:51:41,611
This is me receiving the medal.

1369
01:51:42,988 --> 01:51:45,531
This is the pool in Dachau.

1370
01:51:46,909 --> 01:51:48,910
This is me with my mommy.

1371
01:51:52,247 --> 01:51:53,790
This is also me

1372
01:51:54,083 --> 01:51:55,708
with my daddy.

1373
01:51:58,295 --> 01:51:59,796
Emmi?

1374
01:52:00,297 --> 01:52:02,465
I'm getting undressed.

1375
01:52:03,258 --> 01:52:05,885
Perhaps we'll go swimming together tomorrow.

1376
01:52:05,637 --> 01:52:07,054
Great, Daddy.

1377
01:52:08,514 --> 01:52:10,890
- Good night, Emmi.
- Good night, Daddy.

1378
01:52:16,772 --> 01:52:22,819
<i>I had failed with the radio,
just as I had failed so many times in my life.</i>

1379
01:52:24,405 --> 01:52:29,492
But that night,
I kept repeating to myself,

1380
01:52:31,662 --> 01:52:35,164
"I have saved my son.
I have saved my son.

1381
01:52:36,375 --> 01:52:38,751
"Tomorrow I can see him!

1382
01:52:40,963 --> 01:52:43,423
"And I can tell him goodbye.

1383
01:52:44,091 --> 01:52:46,676
"And he will have been saved."

1384
01:52:46,760 --> 01:52:50,430
Oh, my God, I had such happiness that night!

1385
01:52:52,141 --> 01:52:53,850
Such hope.

1386
01:52:56,353 --> 01:52:59,939
<i>But Hoess did not keep his word.</i>

1387
01:53:03,068 --> 01:53:07,363
<i>I never did know what happened
to my little boy.</i>

1388
01:53:14,955 --> 01:53:17,248
So, you know, that's why I didn't want

1389
01:53:18,959 --> 01:53:21,002
to live no more.

1390
01:53:29,303 --> 01:53:31,387
Till Nathan came

1391
01:53:32,306 --> 01:53:35,057
and he made me live for him.

1392
01:53:47,613 --> 01:53:49,906
Live for me, Sophie.

1393
01:53:50,782 --> 01:53:52,241
Live for me.

1394
01:53:55,954 --> 01:54:00,583
Oh, my God!
What have we done to you?

1395
01:54:57,766 --> 01:54:59,267
Morris, come here!

1396
01:55:00,477 --> 01:55:01,769
Stingo!

1397
01:55:01,853 --> 01:55:04,647
Nathan, put down the chair!
This is no time...

1398
01:55:05,732 --> 01:55:06,774
Put down the chair!

1399
01:55:06,858 --> 01:55:08,025
Put down the chair.

1400
01:55:24,459 --> 01:55:25,876
Stingo!

1401
01:55:26,211 --> 01:55:27,753
Oh, a phone call.

1402
01:55:28,171 --> 01:55:30,965
It's Dr. Landau, Nathan's brother.

1403
01:55:31,049 --> 01:55:33,843
All right. Thank you.

1404
01:55:37,097 --> 01:55:38,723
Yeah, hello.

1405
01:55:38,807 --> 01:55:40,933
<i>Hello, this is Larry,
Nathan's brother.</i>

1406
01:55:41,018 --> 01:55:42,101
Yes, Larry!

1407
01:55:42,185 --> 01:55:45,396
<i>Nathan's talked about you a good deal.
I know you're good friends.</i>

1408
01:55:45,480 --> 01:55:48,065
He's talked about you a great deal.

1409
01:55:48,191 --> 01:55:52,278
<i>And I wonder if it would be possible
for us to arrange a meeting.</i>

1410
01:55:52,362 --> 01:55:54,947
Sure, yeah.
Just tell me when and where.

1411
01:55:56,199 --> 01:55:58,784
My brother thinks the world of you.

1412
01:56:00,370 --> 01:56:02,872
I've never met anybody
more brilliant than Nathan.

1413
01:56:04,207 --> 01:56:06,626
Such a breadth of knowledge.

1414
01:56:06,710 --> 01:56:07,710
You're right.

1415
01:56:08,712 --> 01:56:12,798
He is convinced you're going to be
a major writer,

1416
01:56:12,883 --> 01:56:14,342
something he once dreamed of being.

1417
01:56:14,426 --> 01:56:15,926
Now, please, sit down.

1418
01:56:16,386 --> 01:56:19,055
Seems to me, he's got the talent
of anything he chooses.

1419
01:56:19,139 --> 01:56:23,643
He's told you and Sophie
that he's a research biologist.

1420
01:56:28,023 --> 01:56:29,899
At Pfizer.

1421
01:56:37,949 --> 01:56:42,453
This biologist business
is my brother's masquerade.

1422
01:56:42,913 --> 01:56:46,916
He has no degree of any kind.
All that is a simple fabrication.

1423
01:56:50,045 --> 01:56:53,172
The truth is he's quite mad.

1424
01:56:56,843 --> 01:56:58,344
Christ.

1425
01:56:58,428 --> 01:57:00,012
One of those conditions where

1426
01:57:00,097 --> 01:57:03,724
weeks, months, even years go by
without manifestations and then pow.

1427
01:57:04,801 --> 01:57:08,562
He has a job at Pfizer
in the company library.

1428
01:57:08,647 --> 01:57:10,231
An undemanding sinecure I got for him

1429
01:57:10,315 --> 01:57:13,150
where he can do a lot of reading
without bothering anyone,

1430
01:57:13,235 --> 01:57:15,027
and occasionally he does a little research

1431
01:57:15,112 --> 01:57:17,613
for one of the legitimate biologists
on the staff.

1432
01:57:19,116 --> 01:57:22,493
I'm not sure Nathan would forgive me
if he knew that I told you.

1433
01:57:22,577 --> 01:57:26,163
He made me swear never to tell Sophie.
She knows nothing.

1434
01:57:28,375 --> 01:57:31,919
The cruelest joke is that he was born
the perfect child.

1435
01:57:32,421 --> 01:57:34,422
He excelled in everything.

1436
01:57:34,798 --> 01:57:38,759
Even Nathan's teachers would speculate
on what Nathan would achieve.

1437
01:57:39,344 --> 01:57:41,637
See, he was the kind of child

1438
01:57:43,432 --> 01:57:46,100
everyone prepares to take the credit for.

1439
01:57:47,519 --> 01:57:49,395
When he was 10,

1440
01:57:49,479 --> 01:57:54,275
we were told that the child genius
was a paranoid schizophrenic.

1441
01:57:55,986 --> 01:57:59,155
From then on, the only schools
he attended were

1442
01:58:00,699 --> 01:58:02,575
expensive funny farms.

1443
01:58:06,329 --> 01:58:07,830
What can I do?

1444
01:58:09,791 --> 01:58:14,420
If he could stay off the drugs,
he might have a chance.

1445
01:58:15,997 --> 01:58:17,923
Drugs? What is he on?

1446
01:58:18,925 --> 01:58:20,426
Benzedrine, cocaine.

1447
01:58:21,428 --> 01:58:22,553
You didn't know?

1448
01:58:22,637 --> 01:58:24,138
No, I did not.

1449
01:58:25,849 --> 01:58:28,267
I don't want it to sound
like I'm asking you to spy,

1450
01:58:28,351 --> 01:58:31,395
but if you could simply keep tabs on him

1451
01:58:31,480 --> 01:58:33,898
and report back to me by phone
from time to time,

1452
01:58:33,982 --> 01:58:36,525
letting me know how he's getting on.

1453
01:58:40,071 --> 01:58:42,490
I'm sorry to have to involve you
in this way.

1454
01:58:44,743 --> 01:58:46,952
I don't think you understand.

1455
01:58:48,538 --> 01:58:50,372
I love them both.

1456
01:58:53,418 --> 01:58:55,377
They're friends of mine.

1457
01:59:21,613 --> 01:59:23,113
Good morning, Mr. Stingo.

1458
01:59:23,281 --> 01:59:25,324
We were afraid something terrible
might have befallen you

1459
01:59:25,408 --> 01:59:28,077
on your way back to the pink plantation.

1460
01:59:28,161 --> 01:59:31,705
Miss Sophie was all for having me
institute a search.

1461
01:59:35,744 --> 01:59:37,586
Miss Sophie, you indeed look ravishing.

1462
01:59:37,671 --> 01:59:39,213
Thank you very much.

1463
01:59:40,966 --> 01:59:43,926
So, how are you all,
you are doing this evening?

1464
01:59:45,762 --> 01:59:47,263
Come, darling.

1465
01:59:48,348 --> 01:59:52,351
This was Nathan's idea
to surprise you with a Southern evening.

1466
01:59:52,435 --> 01:59:55,104
Your book has really whet my appetite
to know about the South.

1467
01:59:55,188 --> 01:59:57,273
Tell him about the trip, too.

1468
01:59:57,732 --> 02:00:01,902
Yes, Miss Sophie and I
have been discussing the possibility

1469
02:00:02,487 --> 02:00:05,865
of taking a tour of your
beloved Dixie in October.

1470
02:00:05,949 --> 02:00:07,825
- And I've been thinking...
- Yeah.

1471
02:00:07,909 --> 02:00:09,285
If it's all right with Miss Sophie...

1472
02:00:09,369 --> 02:00:10,369
Sure.

1473
02:00:11,788 --> 02:00:14,790
I was thinking maybe we could make it
a wedding trip

1474
02:00:16,585 --> 02:00:19,962
and have you join us
not just as our best friend,

1475
02:00:21,381 --> 02:00:23,048
but as my best man.

1476
02:00:46,990 --> 02:00:48,908
I have the honor

1477
02:00:50,994 --> 02:00:55,497
to request your hand in marriage.

1478
02:00:59,961 --> 02:01:03,047
To have and to hold,

1479
02:01:05,216 --> 02:01:07,176
from this day forth,

1480
02:01:09,220 --> 02:01:11,513
till death us do part.

1481
02:01:18,313 --> 02:01:19,813
With this ring,

1482
02:01:21,274 --> 02:01:23,192
I betroth myself to you.

1483
02:01:48,385 --> 02:01:53,597
I believe it's traditional for the groom
to give a gift to the best man.

1484
02:02:03,984 --> 02:02:06,485
I told Nathan that you would have to

1485
02:02:06,569 --> 02:02:10,239
put that book away for a while
to make money,

1486
02:02:10,323 --> 02:02:13,242
and that made him very sad.

1487
02:02:21,001 --> 02:02:23,544
Nathan, I can't possibly accept this.

1488
02:02:23,837 --> 02:02:26,463
Stingo, don't reject it.

1489
02:02:28,299 --> 02:02:30,300
Don't waste your talent.

1490
02:02:34,597 --> 02:02:36,890
I don't know how to thank you.

1491
02:02:37,308 --> 02:02:41,186
Would the future Mrs. Landau care to give me
the honor of this dance?

1492
02:03:23,104 --> 02:03:25,397
Isn't it thrilling about Nathan?

1493
02:03:26,816 --> 02:03:28,317
What do you mean?

1494
02:03:29,319 --> 02:03:30,819
You don't know?

1495
02:03:32,572 --> 02:03:35,074
It's supposed to be a secret.

1496
02:03:36,326 --> 02:03:40,996
He confided in me that he and his team

1497
02:03:41,081 --> 02:03:43,916
discovered a cure for polio

1498
02:03:45,001 --> 02:03:46,919
in my house.

1499
02:03:48,296 --> 02:03:51,298
If only my Saul could have lived
to see the day.

1500
02:03:51,382 --> 02:03:53,425
The car is ready, Mrs. Zimmerman.

1501
02:03:53,510 --> 02:03:54,760
Yeah. I'll be down.

1502
02:03:54,844 --> 02:03:57,179
What did Nathan say when he saw you?

1503
02:03:58,515 --> 02:04:00,015
I haven't seen him.

1504
02:04:00,925 --> 02:04:03,268
Well, he and Sophie left here
a couple hours ago.

1505
02:04:03,353 --> 02:04:05,437
He said something about looking for you

1506
02:04:05,522 --> 02:04:08,023
and straightening out things with you
once and for all.

1507
02:04:08,108 --> 02:04:09,650
Wait, what?

1508
02:04:09,734 --> 02:04:11,276
I guess you just missed them.

1509
02:04:11,361 --> 02:04:14,113
Sophie kept telling him
he was imagining things,

1510
02:04:14,197 --> 02:04:17,157
trying to soothe him the way she does
when he gets like that.

1511
02:04:17,242 --> 02:04:20,536
God knows what mashugana idea
was going through his mind this time.

1512
02:04:20,620 --> 02:04:22,204
I told you to watch out.

1513
02:04:22,330 --> 02:04:25,542
Next time you'll listen to Morris Fink?

1514
02:04:26,626 --> 02:04:28,877
My God, it's like I'm the dog catcher
for the whole thing.

1515
02:04:28,962 --> 02:04:30,546
Morris, do you know where he is now?

1516
02:04:30,630 --> 02:04:32,172
No, I don't know.

1517
02:04:56,739 --> 02:04:58,282
Hello.

1518
02:04:58,366 --> 02:05:00,409
<i>God damn you to hell forever.<i>

1519
02:05:01,411 --> 02:05:02,586
Nathan?

1520
02:05:10,170 --> 02:05:11,378
Are you all right?

1521
02:05:11,462 --> 02:05:12,796
Oh, yes. I'm all right.

1522
02:05:12,881 --> 02:05:14,423
What's wrong with your arm?

1523
02:05:14,507 --> 02:05:16,300
He was breaking my arm.

1524
02:05:16,384 --> 02:05:19,011
I got frightened and I ran away.

1525
02:05:19,095 --> 02:05:23,265
He has a gun, Stingo.
I think he's going to use it.

1526
02:05:24,809 --> 02:05:26,768
I shouldn't have left him there.

1527
02:05:27,604 --> 02:05:28,937
We should go find...

1528
02:05:29,647 --> 02:05:31,398
- Nathan?
- <i>Stingo.</i>

1529
02:05:32,108 --> 02:05:34,484
<i>Now, you listen. Listen to me.</i>

1530
02:05:34,611 --> 02:05:36,695
Is it Nathan? Nathan!

1531
02:05:36,779 --> 02:05:37,738
<i>Oh, God!</i>

1532
02:05:37,822 --> 02:05:41,742
Nathan! My darling, you forgive me?

1533
02:05:41,826 --> 02:05:44,119
<i>Get off the phone, you whore!</i>

1534
02:05:44,204 --> 02:05:46,455
You know that I love you.

1535
02:05:47,123 --> 02:05:49,208
<i>I don't want to speak to you again!</i>

1536
02:05:49,292 --> 02:05:51,835
Nathan, we love you very much, all right?

1537
02:05:52,795 --> 02:05:54,671
We would do nothing to hurt you.

1538
02:05:55,590 --> 02:05:57,382
Now, you tell us where you are.

1539
02:05:57,467 --> 02:06:02,054
<i>God damn you to hell forever
for betraying me behind my back.</i>

1540
02:06:02,138 --> 02:06:05,682
<i>You, whom I trust like
the best friend I ever had</i>

1541
02:06:06,434 --> 02:06:10,771
<i>and that shit-eating grin of yours
day after day.</i>

1542
02:06:10,855 --> 02:06:12,981
<i>Butter wouldn't melt in your mouth,
would it,</i>

1543
02:06:13,066 --> 02:06:15,400
<i>when you gave me a piece
of your manuscript to read?</i>

1544
02:06:15,485 --> 02:06:18,195
<i>"Gee, Nathan. Thank you so much."</i>

1545
02:06:18,279 --> 02:06:19,696
<i>When not 15 minutes earlier,</i>

1546
02:06:19,781 --> 02:06:22,574
<i>you'd been humping away in bed
with the woman I was going to marry.</i>

1547
02:06:22,659 --> 02:06:24,576
<i>Marry! Marry!</i>

1548
02:06:24,661 --> 02:06:26,578
<i>I say "was going to," past tense,</i>

1549
02:06:26,663 --> 02:06:29,706
<i>because I'd burn in hell
before I'd marry a two-timing Polack</i>

1550
02:06:29,791 --> 02:06:33,669
<i>who'd spread her legs for a sneaky Southern shithead,
betraying me like that.</i>

1551
02:06:33,753 --> 02:06:36,255
Nathan, we're gonna come get you.
Where are you? All right?

1552
02:06:36,339 --> 02:06:41,009
<i>Come and get me? No. You stay right where you are.
I'm going to come and get you.</i>

1553
02:06:41,094 --> 02:06:42,844
<i>Both of you.</i>

1554
02:06:42,929 --> 02:06:44,429
Jesus, Nathan!

1555
02:06:44,514 --> 02:06:46,014
<i>Don't go away.</i>

1556
02:06:46,140 --> 02:06:51,061
<i>You know what I'm going to do
to you two deceitful, unspeakable pigs?</i>

1557
02:06:51,145 --> 02:06:52,205
<i>Listen!</i>

1558
02:06:53,856 --> 02:06:55,774
<i>Now I'm coming to get you.</i>

1559
02:06:55,858 --> 02:06:56,984
Oh, God!

1560
02:06:57,068 --> 02:06:59,278
I called his brother's office.

1561
02:06:59,654 --> 02:07:02,698
Larry is in Toronto,
but they're going to try and reach him.

1562
02:07:02,782 --> 02:07:04,741
I should've stayed there.

1563
02:07:08,371 --> 02:07:10,497
Maybe I could've helped him.

1564
02:07:12,166 --> 02:07:14,793
He's never been this bad before.

1565
02:07:17,588 --> 02:07:19,715
I think he could've killed us.

1566
02:07:22,093 --> 02:07:24,136
I think he could've killed us both.

1567
02:07:24,220 --> 02:07:26,305
I don't care that I would die.

1568
02:07:27,598 --> 02:07:30,475
I am afraid that he will die without me.

1569
02:07:46,576 --> 02:07:48,076
Thank you.

1570
02:08:10,892 --> 02:08:11,933
Stingo?

1571
02:08:14,354 --> 02:08:16,646
Where are we going?

1572
02:08:20,026 --> 02:08:23,737
Well, I want to take you
to see the Washington sights.

1573
02:08:24,546 --> 02:08:25,822
In the White House.

1574
02:08:26,949 --> 02:08:28,950
Maybe get a peek at Harry Truman.

1575
02:08:29,452 --> 02:08:30,577
Yeah.

1576
02:08:31,579 --> 02:08:32,871
I mean,

1577
02:08:34,832 --> 02:08:36,541
where are we going?

1578
02:08:37,960 --> 02:08:39,753
Where are we really going?

1579
02:08:41,506 --> 02:08:44,049
Well, I'm going to take you down
to that farm

1580
02:08:44,133 --> 02:08:46,176
that I told you about,
in southern Virginia.

1581
02:08:53,643 --> 02:08:55,977
I think once we get settled in there,

1582
02:08:57,271 --> 02:08:59,064
we can drive over to Richmond,

1583
02:08:59,148 --> 02:09:02,401
get a good phonograph,
maybe buy some records.

1584
02:09:04,404 --> 02:09:07,614
What do you mean,
"Get settled in there"?

1585
02:09:08,699 --> 02:09:12,702
Well, I love you very much, Sophie.

1586
02:09:15,206 --> 02:09:19,084
And I want to marry you.

1587
02:09:23,381 --> 02:09:26,758
I want you to live down there
on that farm with me.

1588
02:09:28,177 --> 02:09:30,554
When I write my books there,
I want you to help me

1589
02:09:30,638 --> 02:09:33,598
and I want you to help me raise a family

1590
02:09:34,934 --> 02:09:39,187
because I love you very, very much.

1591
02:09:41,357 --> 02:09:44,317
Is it too much to hope

1592
02:09:46,821 --> 02:09:49,656
that you might love me, too?

1593
02:09:59,959 --> 02:10:05,088
Listen, Stingo,
I'm beyond 30 years now, you know.

1594
02:10:05,173 --> 02:10:08,467
What are you going to do
with an old Polish lady like me?

1595
02:10:09,010 --> 02:10:12,220
Manage. I'll manage.

1596
02:10:13,014 --> 02:10:14,806
"Old woman."

1597
02:10:15,725 --> 02:10:17,476
Don't talk that way.

1598
02:10:19,479 --> 02:10:21,897
You're always going to be

1599
02:10:24,567 --> 02:10:26,067
my number one.

1600
02:10:32,825 --> 02:10:36,536
Well, then, yes, okay.
We could go down there. Sure.

1601
02:10:37,747 --> 02:10:40,457
We could live there for a while and then...

1602
02:10:40,541 --> 02:10:44,211
We're not getting married
because we could decide that later, you know.

1603
02:10:45,713 --> 02:10:49,674
Sophie, the kind of little country place

1604
02:10:49,759 --> 02:10:52,135
I'm talking about that we'd be living in,

1605
02:10:52,220 --> 02:10:54,638
we'd have to be married.

1606
02:10:55,515 --> 02:10:59,100
Jesus, Sophie, these are Christians
down there, you know.

1607
02:11:01,354 --> 02:11:04,272
Well, I don't know, I mean,

1608
02:11:06,734 --> 02:11:10,153
getting married soon,
I've loved you a very long time.

1609
02:11:16,285 --> 02:11:18,119
I know you're fond of me.

1610
02:11:24,460 --> 02:11:28,296
Give us time. Just give us time.

1611
02:11:29,590 --> 02:11:31,633
We'll be fine.

1612
02:11:46,440 --> 02:11:49,401
It is not just the age difference, you know,

1613
02:11:50,611 --> 02:11:52,696
between you and me, Stingo.

1614
02:11:55,825 --> 02:12:00,495
You should have another mother
for your children.

1615
02:12:01,956 --> 02:12:03,206
Only you.

1616
02:12:04,041 --> 02:12:08,086
It would not be fair to your children
to have me as their mother.

1617
02:12:10,339 --> 02:12:13,008
Sophie, they would be
the luckiest children in the world.

1618
02:12:15,177 --> 02:12:17,929
I'm going to tell you something.

1619
02:12:20,850 --> 02:12:25,478
I'm going to tell you something now
I have never told anybody.

1620
02:12:30,192 --> 02:12:34,571
Never, but I need a drink,
so would you get me that first?

1621
02:13:06,062 --> 02:13:09,230
On the day that we went

1622
02:13:13,235 --> 02:13:17,530
to Auschwitz, it was spring, you know,

1623
02:13:19,124 --> 02:13:21,034
and we arrived there at night.

1624
02:13:21,118 --> 02:13:24,788
It was a warm night,
it was a beautiful night.

1625
02:13:30,127 --> 02:13:32,295
Mommy, you're hurting me!

1626
02:15:34,168 --> 02:15:36,044
You're so beautiful.

1627
02:15:41,509 --> 02:15:43,551
I'd like to get you in bed.

1628
02:15:49,558 --> 02:15:51,392
Are you a Polack?

1629
02:15:54,230 --> 02:15:55,688
You!

1630
02:15:58,108 --> 02:16:01,402
Are you also one of those filthy communists?

1631
02:16:11,789 --> 02:16:13,623
I am a Pole!

1632
02:16:13,999 --> 02:16:18,086
I was born in Krakow! I am not a Jew!
Neither are my children!

1633
02:16:18,420 --> 02:16:20,713
They're not Jews.
They are racially pure.

1634
02:16:20,798 --> 02:16:21,881
I'm a Christian.

1635
02:16:22,633 --> 02:16:24,592
I'm a devout Catholic.

1636
02:16:49,994 --> 02:16:51,369
You're not a communist?

1637
02:16:54,290 --> 02:16:55,957
You're a believer.

1638
02:16:56,125 --> 02:16:59,294
Yes, sir. I believe in Christ.

1639
02:17:02,089 --> 02:17:05,967
So you believe in Christ, the Redeemer?

1640
02:17:06,218 --> 02:17:07,302
Yes!

1641
02:17:22,985 --> 02:17:25,028
Did he not say,

1642
02:17:25,821 --> 02:17:28,072
"Suffer the little children

1643
02:17:29,199 --> 02:17:31,743
"to come unto me?"

1644
02:17:37,583 --> 02:17:40,209
You may keep one of your children.

1645
02:17:42,922 --> 02:17:44,339
I beg your pardon?

1646
02:17:45,341 --> 02:17:48,092
You may keep one of your children.

1647
02:17:49,136 --> 02:17:51,137
The other one must go.

1648
02:17:52,097 --> 02:17:54,557
You mean, I have to choose?

1649
02:17:58,103 --> 02:18:00,813
You're a Polack not a Yid.

1650
02:18:02,900 --> 02:18:05,735
That gives you a privilege, a choice.

1651
02:18:08,155 --> 02:18:11,616
I can't choose! I can't choose!

1652
02:18:11,951 --> 02:18:13,660
- Be quiet.
- I can't choose!

1653
02:18:14,495 --> 02:18:17,914
Choose! Or I'll send them both over there!

1654
02:18:18,582 --> 02:18:20,124
Make a choice!

1655
02:18:20,250 --> 02:18:22,961
Don't make me choose! I can't!

1656
02:18:23,045 --> 02:18:25,046
I'll send them both over there.

1657
02:18:26,840 --> 02:18:28,508
Shut up! Enough!

1658
02:18:28,968 --> 02:18:32,261
I told you to shut up!
Make a choice!

1659
02:18:32,888 --> 02:18:35,056
Don't make me choose! I can't!

1660
02:18:35,432 --> 02:18:37,934
- I'll send them both over there!
- I can't choose!

1661
02:18:38,560 --> 02:18:39,978
Take both children away!

1662
02:18:40,312 --> 02:18:41,312
Move!

1663
02:18:42,481 --> 02:18:43,564
Take my little girl!

1664
02:18:45,734 --> 02:18:47,568
Take my baby!

1665
02:18:48,737 --> 02:18:51,990
Take my little girl!

1666
02:19:21,270 --> 02:19:22,478
So.

1667
02:19:27,401 --> 02:19:30,611
We will go to that farm tomorrow, yeah.

1668
02:19:35,617 --> 02:19:38,161
But please, Stingo,

1669
02:19:41,206 --> 02:19:43,791
don't talk about marriage

1670
02:19:54,094 --> 02:19:56,054
and children.

1671
02:20:07,316 --> 02:20:08,941
It's enough that

1672
02:20:10,986 --> 02:20:13,196
we go down there

1673
02:20:17,159 --> 02:20:18,534
and live

1674
02:20:23,791 --> 02:20:25,249
for a while.

1675
02:21:52,880 --> 02:21:56,007
<i>I was 22 and a virgin</i>

1676
02:21:56,091 --> 02:21:58,885
<i>and was clasping in my arms at last</i>

1677
02:21:58,969 --> 02:22:01,762
<i>the goddess of my unending fantasies.</i>

1678
02:22:03,223 --> 02:22:05,766
<i>My lust was inexhaustible.</i>

1679
02:22:07,477 --> 02:22:11,772
<i>Sophie's lust was both
a plunge into carnal oblivion</i>

1680
02:22:11,857 --> 02:22:14,692
<i>and a flight from memory and grief.</i>

1681
02:22:16,486 --> 02:22:18,779
<i>More than that, I now see,</i>

1682
02:22:20,157 --> 02:22:23,492
<i>it was a frantic attempt
to beat back death.</i>

1683
02:22:26,788 --> 02:22:28,623
<i>"My dearest Stingo.</i>

1684
02:22:30,459 --> 02:22:34,503
<i>"You are such a beautiful lover.
I had to leave,</i>

1685
02:22:34,588 --> 02:22:39,926
<i>"and forgive me for not saying goodbye,
but I must go back to Nathan.</i>

1686
02:22:41,303 --> 02:22:44,138
<i>"Believe me, you will find
some wonderful woman</i>

1687
02:22:44,223 --> 02:22:46,515
<i>"to make you happy on that farm.</i>

1688
02:22:48,101 --> 02:22:52,897
<i>"But when I woke,
I was feeling so terrible</i>

1689
02:22:54,316 --> 02:22:56,525
<i>"and in despair about Nathan.</i>

1690
02:22:56,610 --> 02:23:00,571
<i>"By that, I mean so filled with guilt,
thoughts of death.</i>

1691
02:23:00,656 --> 02:23:04,325
<i>"It was like ice flowing in my blood.</i>

1692
02:23:05,160 --> 02:23:09,664
<i>"So I must be with Nathan again,
for whatever that means.</i>

1693
02:23:11,875 --> 02:23:15,086
<i>"I may not see you again,</i>

1694
02:23:17,172 --> 02:23:21,634
<i>"but do believe me how much knowing you
has meant to me.</i>

1695
02:23:23,011 --> 02:23:25,888
<i>"You are a great lover, Stingo.</i>

1696
02:23:27,516 --> 02:23:29,016
<i>"Sophie."</i>

1697
02:23:35,190 --> 02:23:37,900
Landau. L-A-N-D-A-U.

1698
02:23:37,985 --> 02:23:40,111
He worked in a pharmaceutical lab.

1699
02:23:40,195 --> 02:23:43,531
I think that's how he got ahold
of the cyanide, you see.

1700
02:23:43,615 --> 02:23:45,866
They found it next to the bed, you know.

1701
02:23:45,951 --> 02:23:47,326
What lab, do you know?

1702
02:23:47,411 --> 02:23:49,287
I'm not sure where it was.

1703
02:26:04,131 --> 02:26:06,006
"Ample make this bed.

1704
02:26:08,218 --> 02:26:10,386
"Make this bed with awe.

1705
02:26:12,180 --> 02:26:13,431
"In it,

1706
02:26:15,725 --> 02:26:17,768
"wait till judgment break,

1707
02:26:19,020 --> 02:26:20,896
"excellent and fair.

1708
02:26:25,735 --> 02:26:27,778
"Be its mattress straight.

1709
02:26:29,865 --> 02:26:31,740
"Be its pillow round.

1710
02:26:33,827 --> 02:26:36,370
"Let no sunrise yellow noise

1711
02:26:37,998 --> 02:26:40,583
"interrupt this ground."

1712
02:26:45,714 --> 02:26:48,924
<i>And so ended my voyage of discovery</i>

1713
02:26:49,009 --> 02:26:51,177
<i>in a place as strange as Brooklyn.</i>

1714
02:26:54,514 --> 02:26:58,642
<i>I let go of the rage and sorrow
for Sophie and Nathan</i>

1715
02:26:58,727 --> 02:27:00,811
<i>and for the many others
who were but a few</i>

1716
02:27:00,896 --> 02:27:05,858
<i>of the butchered and betrayed
and martyred children of the Earth.</i>

1717
02:27:07,402 --> 02:27:09,778
<i>When I could finally see again,</i>

1718
02:27:10,655 --> 02:27:15,242
<i>I saw the first rays of daylight
reflected in the murky river.</i>

1719
02:27:17,537 --> 02:27:19,830
<i>This was not judgment day.</i>

1720
02:27:20,582 --> 02:27:22,249
<i>Only morning.</i>

1721
02:27:23,376 --> 02:27:27,463
<i>Morning, excellent and fair.</i>
