1
00:00:53,162 --> 00:00:54,953
<i>You are safe here
with me.</i>

2
00:01:41,622 --> 00:01:44,122
<i>Has a decision been reached
on how far this country</i>

3
00:01:44,206 --> 00:01:45,331
<i>would be willing to go</i>

4
00:01:45,372 --> 00:01:49,456
<i>in helping an anti-Castro
uprising or invasion in Cuba?</i>

5
00:01:49,830 --> 00:01:52,372
<i>Well,
first, I want to say that
there will not be,</i>

6
00:01:52,456 --> 00:01:53,830
<i>under any conditions,</i>

7
00:01:54,623 --> 00:01:57,623
<i>an intervention in Cuba
by United States armed forces.</i>

8
00:01:57,955 --> 00:02:01,080
<i>And this government
will do everything
it possibly can,</i>

9
00:02:01,122 --> 00:02:03,831
<i>and I think it can meet
its responsibilities,</i>

10
00:02:03,956 --> 00:02:08,456
<i>to make sure that there are
no Americans involved
in any actions inside Cuba.</i>

11
00:02:53,166 --> 00:02:55,708
Excuse me, sir.
Do you have change
for a dollar?

12
00:03:03,417 --> 00:03:05,084
Thank you, sir.
You're welcome.

13
00:03:39,293 --> 00:03:42,043
From our friends
on Wall Street. Miami?

14
00:03:42,752 --> 00:03:44,126
Right away.

15
00:03:57,044 --> 00:03:58,877
Cardinal is interested.

16
00:04:08,795 --> 00:04:13,211
So, the weatherman
says Sunday is a perfect day
for a trip to the beach.

17
00:04:14,252 --> 00:04:15,795
I hope
you can still dance, Edward.

18
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:20,461
Couple of days,
we'll be doing the cha-cha
in EI Comandante's bedroom.

19
00:04:20,503 --> 00:04:23,003
I'll try to remember
to bring my dancing shoes,
Richard.

20
00:04:24,628 --> 00:04:26,962
Morning, Ray.
Mr. Hayes.

21
00:04:31,045 --> 00:04:34,045
Miami, and our op center
off Guatemala.

22
00:04:35,796 --> 00:04:39,212
Pack a bathing suit,
Mr. Brocco.
We're going for a swim.

23
00:04:39,796 --> 00:04:42,504
What do you make
of our chances for success?

24
00:04:43,796 --> 00:04:46,629
If we get the support
that we've been promised,

25
00:04:47,046 --> 00:04:49,255
I'd say it's fairly certain.

26
00:04:49,963 --> 00:04:52,171
But if there are any doubts,
I can still put out the fire.

27
00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:54,129
It's gone beyond that.

28
00:04:55,213 --> 00:04:57,546
Rocking Chair
is still smiling.

29
00:04:59,879 --> 00:05:01,672
It's the White House.

30
00:05:02,046 --> 00:05:05,713
Everybody's waiting
for the good news.
Godspeed.

31
00:05:08,213 --> 00:05:11,505
When you're back,
come up to the mountains.
We'll go fishing.

32
00:05:16,546 --> 00:05:17,880
Yes, sir.

33
00:05:18,588 --> 00:05:20,547
He's been put on notice.

34
00:05:22,506 --> 00:05:25,297
<i>In Cuba,
sometime before dawn,</i>

35
00:05:25,714 --> 00:05:29,005
<i>the invading forces'
B-26 bombers give air cover</i>

36
00:05:29,548 --> 00:05:31,714
<i>to men landing on the beach.</i>

37
00:05:33,839 --> 00:05:38,006
<i>As the sun rises,
there is a surprise attack
from Castro's air force.</i>

38
00:05:38,173 --> 00:05:40,798
<i>The B-26es are shot down.</i>

39
00:05:41,881 --> 00:05:45,881
<i>Without air cover,
the anti-Castro force's ships
are attacked.</i>

40
00:05:46,173 --> 00:05:50,465
<i>And the men are cut off
from their supplies.
The situation looks dire.</i>

41
00:05:51,674 --> 00:05:54,006
"Where is the air support?

42
00:05:54,507 --> 00:05:56,632
"Where the hell is the Navy?

43
00:05:56,966 --> 00:06:01,757
"Could you throw something
into this vital point
in the battle?

44
00:06:04,507 --> 00:06:08,174
"Enemy in Red...
Trucks coming from Red Beach

45
00:06:08,299 --> 00:06:11,383
"are right now
one kilometer from Blue Beach.

46
00:06:13,424 --> 00:06:18,424
"Two thousand militia
attacking Blue Beach
from east to west.

47
00:06:18,675 --> 00:06:22,508
<i>"We need close air support
immediately.</i>

48
00:06:24,716 --> 00:06:28,008
"Well, I am destroying
all my equipment
and communications.

49
00:06:28,174 --> 00:06:30,883
"I have nothing
with which to fight.
I am going to the woods.

50
00:06:31,008 --> 00:06:34,050
"I cannot wait for you.
I am going to the woods."

51
00:07:12,176 --> 00:07:14,260
They knew
where to find us.

52
00:07:20,052 --> 00:07:22,468
There's a stranger
in our house, sir.

53
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:10,303
<i>I love you.</i>

54
00:08:11,345 --> 00:08:14,804
<i>People who really love
each other don't have secrets.</i>

55
00:08:15,303 --> 00:08:17,345
<i>You are safe here with me.</i>

56
00:08:28,596 --> 00:08:30,221
<i>I love you.</i>

57
00:08:31,179 --> 00:08:34,221
<i>People who really love
each other don't have secrets.</i>

58
00:08:35,012 --> 00:08:37,054
<i>You are safe here with me.</i>

59
00:08:39,221 --> 00:08:42,055
<i>You have such a...</i>

60
00:08:51,139 --> 00:08:52,680
<i>I love you.</i>

61
00:08:53,472 --> 00:08:56,514
<i>People who really love
each other don't have secrets.</i>

62
00:09:01,014 --> 00:09:03,514
<i>You are safe here with me.</i>

63
00:09:10,723 --> 00:09:15,223
<i>The President's saying
he's going to break the CIA
into a thousand pieces.</i>

64
00:09:16,556 --> 00:09:19,265
<i>Somebody on your desk
gave away the store.</i>

65
00:09:20,931 --> 00:09:23,848
Told the Soviets
where to find you
at the Bay of Pigs.

66
00:09:23,973 --> 00:09:26,890
You got a big problem,
very close to home.

67
00:09:28,432 --> 00:09:32,348
There's gonna be
an extensive house-cleaning
on your side of the street.

68
00:09:36,765 --> 00:09:38,473
Fucking cigarettes.

69
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:42,141
My ring doesn't even
fit me anymore.

70
00:09:46,807 --> 00:09:48,724
They didn't get it all.

71
00:09:49,141 --> 00:09:50,516
I'm sorry.

72
00:09:51,016 --> 00:09:52,558
Be careful.

73
00:09:53,850 --> 00:09:58,349
Your name is
on a "must worry" list,
right at the very top.

74
00:10:10,267 --> 00:10:11,891
You forgot your hat.

75
00:10:36,018 --> 00:10:39,226
Somebody left
a package on my doorstep
last night.

76
00:10:39,268 --> 00:10:41,560
Have Tech wash them
right away.

77
00:10:49,143 --> 00:10:51,351
I've been trying to reach you.

78
00:10:51,393 --> 00:10:53,184
<i>I haven't been staying
at the Embassy compound.</i>

79
00:10:53,226 --> 00:10:54,810
<i>I've been doing
some outside work.</i>

80
00:10:55,643 --> 00:10:57,393
I heard there was a setback.

81
00:10:57,810 --> 00:11:00,935
Sometimes the best-laid plans
of mice and men...

82
00:11:02,810 --> 00:11:04,185
<i>Be very careful.</i>

83
00:11:04,352 --> 00:11:06,644
I'll be fine.
You worry too much.

84
00:11:07,477 --> 00:11:08,977
Just please be careful.

85
00:11:09,144 --> 00:11:10,852
<i>Everything's fine.</i>

86
00:11:11,769 --> 00:11:12,853
Goodbye, Son.

87
00:11:13,227 --> 00:11:14,853
Goodbye, Father.

88
00:12:34,022 --> 00:12:36,189
<i>We sail the ocean blue</i>

89
00:12:52,064 --> 00:12:56,939
<i>I'm called little Buttercup
Dear little Buttercup</i>

90
00:12:56,981 --> 00:13:00,482
<i>Though I could never tell why</i>

91
00:13:01,148 --> 00:13:05,815
<i>But still I'm called Buttercup
Poor little Buttercup</i>

92
00:13:06,149 --> 00:13:09,648
<i>Sweet little Buttercup, I</i>

93
00:13:10,316 --> 00:13:14,648
<i>I've treacle and toffee
I've tea and I've coffee</i>

94
00:13:15,232 --> 00:13:17,982
But hark ye, my merry friend,
hast ever thought

95
00:13:18,024 --> 00:13:21,982
that beneath this gay
and frivolous

96
00:13:23,483 --> 00:13:24,899
exterior

97
00:13:26,982 --> 00:13:29,191
there may lurk a

98
00:13:29,441 --> 00:13:30,733
cankerworm?

99
00:13:43,233 --> 00:13:46,941
Miss Buttercup.
Skull and Bones.
Accept or reject?

100
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:50,150
Accept.

101
00:13:52,150 --> 00:13:53,734
Not a word to anyone.

102
00:13:56,150 --> 00:13:59,358
How does it feel
being a woman?
Why do you want to know?

103
00:14:01,151 --> 00:14:02,525
<i>Gentlemen,</i>

104
00:14:03,026 --> 00:14:06,817
<i>I will remind you,
you have all taken
an oath of secrecy.</i>

105
00:14:08,318 --> 00:14:12,193
<i>You have been chosen
to become members of
America's most secret society.</i>

106
00:14:14,568 --> 00:14:16,777
For over 100 years,

107
00:14:17,359 --> 00:14:20,234
Skull and Bones members
have included a President,

108
00:14:20,735 --> 00:14:24,151
Vice Presidents,
Supreme Court justices,

109
00:14:24,568 --> 00:14:28,902
congressmen and senators,
captains of science
and industry.

110
00:14:29,235 --> 00:14:31,526
The very best of America.

111
00:14:58,028 --> 00:15:00,903
I don't think
this is for me.
You can't take it
personally.

112
00:15:00,944 --> 00:15:04,986
Getting pissed on is personal,
Mr. Russell.
I take it very personally.

113
00:15:05,694 --> 00:15:08,195
Edward, we're all
in this together.

114
00:15:09,654 --> 00:15:11,320
Come back inside.

115
00:15:12,695 --> 00:15:14,487
We're brothers for life.

116
00:15:20,695 --> 00:15:25,237
Tell us, Mr. Wilson, brother
to brother, something you've
never told anyone before.

117
00:15:26,528 --> 00:15:28,570
Your most guarded secret.

118
00:15:29,196 --> 00:15:32,154
Something you will need
to trust us with.

119
00:15:36,237 --> 00:15:38,821
It was
the Fourth of July, 1925.

120
00:15:40,488 --> 00:15:41,988
I was six.

121
00:15:45,321 --> 00:15:48,072
<i>I was playing tag
with a friend of mine.</i>

122
00:15:48,321 --> 00:15:49,988
Edward, careful.

123
00:15:50,155 --> 00:15:54,155
<i>And I tried to get away from
him, so I ran up the stairs
into my parents' room</i>

124
00:15:55,489 --> 00:15:57,197
<i>and I hid in the closet.</i>

125
00:16:00,405 --> 00:16:04,572
I looked at my father's
clothes, and hanging there
was his Admiral's jacket.

126
00:16:07,197 --> 00:16:08,238
And then I heard a sound.

127
00:16:09,322 --> 00:16:11,114
<i>And I saw my father.</i>

128
00:16:13,238 --> 00:16:15,281
<i>And I must have made a noise,
because he turned,</i>

129
00:16:15,322 --> 00:16:17,572
<i>and came into the closet
and opened the door.</i>

130
00:16:19,448 --> 00:16:22,073
<i>Have you ever
made up a story, Edward?</i>

131
00:16:22,573 --> 00:16:24,739
<i>Told your friends something
you knew wasn't true,</i>

132
00:16:24,864 --> 00:16:29,031
and you know that if they
found out, they wouldn't
like you anymore?

133
00:16:29,906 --> 00:16:32,698
<i>Why? Because
you lied to them.</i>

134
00:16:33,323 --> 00:16:34,865
Do you understand?

135
00:16:36,698 --> 00:16:39,240
<i>And he asked me
if I knew what trust was.</i>

136
00:16:39,907 --> 00:16:42,573
And I said,
"Trust is when you feel safe
with someone."

137
00:16:42,657 --> 00:16:45,865
Like with my friends.
Like with you and Mother.

138
00:16:45,907 --> 00:16:48,573
And then he said,
"Don't ever lie.

139
00:16:50,074 --> 00:16:53,366
<i>"If you lie to your friends,
they won't trust you.</i>

140
00:16:55,658 --> 00:16:57,324
"And you will have nothing

141
00:17:00,324 --> 00:17:02,366
"and you'll never be safe."

142
00:17:05,116 --> 00:17:09,574
He told me to go downstairs
and watch the fireworks,
because they'd started.

143
00:17:14,158 --> 00:17:15,824
And then he shut the door.

144
00:17:21,991 --> 00:17:26,158
The sound of the gunshot
was very different from
the sound of the fireworks.

145
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:29,700
And even at six years old,
I knew there was
a big, big difference.

146
00:17:32,408 --> 00:17:33,867
<i>There was a lot of blood.</i>

147
00:17:34,575 --> 00:17:35,742
Father?

148
00:17:37,409 --> 00:17:40,659
<i>And in his left hand,
he held a note
that was sealed.</i>

149
00:17:43,159 --> 00:17:46,368
<i>I don't know why,
but I took the note
and I put it in my pocket.</i>

150
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:51,117
<i>I always said
it was an accident.</i>

151
00:17:53,159 --> 00:17:55,701
It wasn't an accident.
My father killed himself.

152
00:18:11,577 --> 00:18:14,702
Congratulations, Mr. Wilson.
I'm Richard Hayes,

153
00:18:14,910 --> 00:18:17,160
Master of Secrets and Orders.

154
00:18:20,702 --> 00:18:22,410
What did the note say?

155
00:18:22,494 --> 00:18:24,661
I told you,
I never read the note.

156
00:18:24,911 --> 00:18:26,577
You didn't read the note?

157
00:18:28,328 --> 00:18:29,452
No.

158
00:18:34,869 --> 00:18:39,286
My father said your father
was going to be appointed
Secretary of the Navy

159
00:18:40,703 --> 00:18:44,578
until his loyalty
was brought under question.

160
00:18:49,370 --> 00:18:51,829
We're not gonna have a problem
with your loyalty, are we?

161
00:18:57,412 --> 00:19:01,496
<i>"And yet,
a certain word,
a glance, a guise</i>

162
00:19:02,079 --> 00:19:05,912
<i>"Will mirror never show,
reflecting not my gaze</i>

163
00:19:06,329 --> 00:19:08,663
<i>"But my uncertain question
caught</i>

164
00:19:09,079 --> 00:19:11,788
<i>"Inside a shadow
of our shifting eyes?"</i>

165
00:19:15,496 --> 00:19:17,788
That really is quite elegant,
Mr. Wilson.

166
00:19:18,913 --> 00:19:20,955
Good order. Very precise.

167
00:19:21,746 --> 00:19:23,663
Feeling of the unknown.

168
00:19:24,538 --> 00:19:27,746
Fine poetry is the music
of mathematics.

169
00:19:28,704 --> 00:19:30,664
Numbers singing.

170
00:19:31,788 --> 00:19:35,580
You have to look
behind the words
to understand their meaning.

171
00:19:38,414 --> 00:19:39,997
Right. Well, good night,
gentlemen.

172
00:19:42,330 --> 00:19:43,831
Mr. Wilson?

173
00:19:43,914 --> 00:19:47,039
May I see you in my office
for a few words?

174
00:19:48,914 --> 00:19:52,831
<i>I'm recommending you as editor
of our poetry magazine,
The Poeticus.</i>

175
00:19:54,248 --> 00:19:57,914
I'm honored. Thank you.
I appreciate your faith in me.

176
00:19:58,415 --> 00:20:01,373
Never be ashamed
of your abilities, Edward.

177
00:20:16,957 --> 00:20:19,332
Wasn't there a picture
that used to sit
on the mantel, there?

178
00:20:19,416 --> 00:20:21,582
It was a group of soldiers?

179
00:20:21,873 --> 00:20:24,582
It's my father's
Crimean War regiment.

180
00:20:24,708 --> 00:20:26,124
The glass broke.

181
00:20:28,249 --> 00:20:30,082
I'm having it mended.

182
00:20:31,082 --> 00:20:35,124
I remembered it because
it reminded me of my father.
He was in the war.

183
00:20:39,833 --> 00:20:41,499
I think we're being watched.

184
00:20:41,708 --> 00:20:43,833
Being watched?
What do you mean?

185
00:20:44,499 --> 00:20:46,166
There's a man in a hat.

186
00:20:53,667 --> 00:20:55,417
I don't see anybody.

187
00:20:56,583 --> 00:21:00,709
You know, there's so much
I'd like to share with you,
Edward.

188
00:21:01,875 --> 00:21:04,542
But I hardly know anything
about you at all,

189
00:21:04,583 --> 00:21:07,583
apart from you being
a particularly bright student.

190
00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:15,750
I feel that we have
a kind of kindred spirit.

191
00:21:18,834 --> 00:21:20,501
I really should be going.

192
00:21:20,543 --> 00:21:22,668
Oh, I've started
to write something.

193
00:21:22,710 --> 00:21:24,543
Perhaps you'd like
to hear it.

194
00:21:31,835 --> 00:21:34,418
"A bud has burst
on the upper bough

195
00:21:35,127 --> 00:21:37,918
"The linnet sang
in my heart today

196
00:21:38,252 --> 00:21:41,002
"I know where the pale green
grasses show

197
00:21:42,085 --> 00:21:45,085
<i>"By a tiny runnel,
off the way</i>

198
00:21:45,419 --> 00:21:47,085
<i>"And the earth is wet</i>

199
00:21:47,377 --> 00:21:52,085
<i>"A cuckoo said in my brain,
'Not yet, not yet"'</i>

200
00:21:53,752 --> 00:21:54,877
I haven't finished it.

201
00:22:20,211 --> 00:22:21,587
Excuse me.

202
00:22:24,045 --> 00:22:25,420
Excuse me.

203
00:22:32,254 --> 00:22:33,628
Please.

204
00:22:33,837 --> 00:22:36,421
I'm sorry. I can't hear.

205
00:22:48,337 --> 00:22:49,754
What's your name?

206
00:22:52,546 --> 00:22:54,005
Edward.

207
00:22:55,546 --> 00:22:59,088
I'm sorry.
Would you say it again?
I have to read your lips.

208
00:22:59,213 --> 00:23:00,505
Edward.

209
00:23:01,547 --> 00:23:03,380
Hello, Edward.

210
00:23:04,589 --> 00:23:05,880
I'm Laura.

211
00:23:06,255 --> 00:23:08,921
I'm sorry,
would you say that again?

212
00:23:38,256 --> 00:23:41,339
There isn't one person
in a hundred who would walk
by a hat on a bench

213
00:23:41,381 --> 00:23:43,256
without giving it
a second look.

214
00:23:44,673 --> 00:23:48,340
That says a lot about you,
Mr. Wilson.
You don't distract easily.

215
00:23:50,340 --> 00:23:52,215
She's a very pretty girl.

216
00:23:52,549 --> 00:23:55,549
Sam Murach. I'm with
the Federal Bureau
of Investigation.

217
00:24:02,340 --> 00:24:04,591
Mind if I walk along with you?

218
00:24:06,174 --> 00:24:08,924
I had a chance to have a talk
with a fraternity brother
of yours.

219
00:24:09,049 --> 00:24:11,340
John Russell,
the senator's son.

220
00:24:11,549 --> 00:24:15,175
John said you might help us.
You're friendly
with Dr. Fredericks?

221
00:24:15,674 --> 00:24:18,175
He's my thesis advisor,
if that's what you mean.

222
00:24:18,216 --> 00:24:20,508
He's been recruiting faculty
members and students

223
00:24:20,674 --> 00:24:24,216
to join an organization called
the American German
Cultural Committee.

224
00:24:24,258 --> 00:24:27,508
It's a Nazi front.
Has he talked to you
about that?

225
00:24:29,258 --> 00:24:31,717
I'm a poetry student,
Mr. Murach.

226
00:24:33,258 --> 00:24:34,717
I'm not political.

227
00:24:34,758 --> 00:24:37,925
We'd be very interested
in finding out the names of
some of the other organizers

228
00:24:37,925 --> 00:24:39,675
for the Cultural Committee.

229
00:24:40,009 --> 00:24:42,426
Are you asking me to spy
on Dr. Fredericks?

230
00:24:42,842 --> 00:24:44,592
I'm asking you
to be a good citizen.

231
00:24:52,009 --> 00:24:54,676
You blow that thing up,
it'll be fine.

232
00:25:01,843 --> 00:25:03,426
I'll be seeing you.

233
00:25:05,093 --> 00:25:07,926
<i>In Poland, Hitler watches
German regiments</i>

234
00:25:08,010 --> 00:25:09,885
<i>stream across the river San.</i>

235
00:25:09,926 --> 00:25:12,926
<i>This was part
of the river line which
the invading army forced</i>

236
00:25:12,926 --> 00:25:16,343
<i>in its flanking drive
through southern Poland.</i>

237
00:25:16,801 --> 00:25:19,719
<i>The Nazi Führer
makes a quick tour
in the conquered nation</i>

238
00:25:19,719 --> 00:25:22,343
<i>among the soldiers
in captured towns.</i>

239
00:25:23,469 --> 00:25:27,927
<i>Hitler has given the word
of war, and war it is!
Poland has been guaranteed...</i>

240
00:25:28,011 --> 00:25:32,219
Ladies and gentlemen, it is
a great privilege to have with
us here tonight Mr. Haupt,

241
00:25:32,343 --> 00:25:34,053
the Führer's
Education Minister.

242
00:25:34,386 --> 00:25:35,428
Mr. Haupt?

243
00:25:36,344 --> 00:25:37,386
Good evening.

244
00:25:37,428 --> 00:25:41,219
Thank you, Dr. Fredericks
and members of the American
German Cultural Committee,

245
00:25:41,344 --> 00:25:43,595
for giving me the opportunity
to come to Yale.

246
00:25:43,762 --> 00:25:45,428
Germany has always been
a country of...

247
00:25:45,553 --> 00:25:47,553
Yes. Interesting.

248
00:25:50,762 --> 00:25:52,094
It has been
a great pleasure...

249
00:26:01,762 --> 00:26:04,179
...making
new acquaintances...

250
00:26:05,970 --> 00:26:07,345
Excuse me.
Of course.

251
00:26:29,596 --> 00:26:31,388
Someone's in here!

252
00:27:01,556 --> 00:27:04,431
Are you enjoying yourself,
Edward?
Very much so.

253
00:27:04,514 --> 00:27:07,222
I'd like you
to meet Mr. Haupt.

254
00:27:09,598 --> 00:27:12,057
- You know Dr. Manheim?
- Yes, we've met.

255
00:27:12,765 --> 00:27:17,848
I've been asked by the faculty
chairman to relinquish
my post here at Yale.

256
00:27:19,723 --> 00:27:23,057
Now, you'll hear many reasons
for what caused my departure.

257
00:27:23,931 --> 00:27:27,223
Suffice it to say I'm leaving
with my name intact.

258
00:27:28,890 --> 00:27:30,766
Good luck in your endeavors.

259
00:27:37,599 --> 00:27:38,766
Now, Edward,

260
00:27:42,641 --> 00:27:44,891
what did I do
to deserve this?

261
00:27:45,557 --> 00:27:49,515
Have you such little regard
for me that you'd betray me
for my political beliefs?

262
00:27:50,141 --> 00:27:55,099
You know and I know
Trumbull Stickney
wrote that poem in 1902.

263
00:27:57,058 --> 00:28:00,224
You were my teacher.
You betrayed me.

264
00:28:21,767 --> 00:28:23,850
I thought
we were going to a party.

265
00:28:28,851 --> 00:28:31,726
You want to protect me
from them, don't you?

266
00:28:31,809 --> 00:28:33,267
No.

267
00:28:33,351 --> 00:28:35,601
You think they'll make
fun of me.
That's not it.

268
00:28:35,726 --> 00:28:38,060
That's not true.
It's okay.

269
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:48,560
I'm happy to be with you.

270
00:28:57,393 --> 00:28:59,227
Would you like to dance?

271
00:29:00,019 --> 00:29:01,769
I'm not a very good dancer.

272
00:29:01,852 --> 00:29:03,936
That's all right.
I'm not a good dancer either.

273
00:29:14,769 --> 00:29:16,728
How does this song go?

274
00:29:22,603 --> 00:29:25,520
<i>Blue skies</i>

275
00:29:27,436 --> 00:29:29,728
<i>Smiling on me</i>

276
00:29:33,354 --> 00:29:36,686
<i>Nothing but blue skies</i>

277
00:29:39,853 --> 00:29:42,062
<i>Do I see</i>

278
00:29:49,604 --> 00:29:52,104
<i>Excuse me, everybody,
I have an announcement.</i>

279
00:29:52,187 --> 00:29:55,896
<i>I've just been told
England and France
declared war on Germany.</i>

280
00:29:56,104 --> 00:29:59,396
<i>But please continue dancing
and enjoying our music.</i>

281
00:29:59,771 --> 00:30:01,979
<i>And I'll update you
as information comes in.</i>

282
00:30:02,063 --> 00:30:03,396
<i>Thank you.</i>

283
00:30:17,814 --> 00:30:20,271
Before long,
we'll be at war, too.

284
00:30:29,064 --> 00:30:31,688
Would you like to get
a room for us?

285
00:31:02,524 --> 00:31:03,649
Umm...

286
00:31:06,899 --> 00:31:08,440
Turn down the light.

287
00:31:20,774 --> 00:31:22,941
I can't. I can't.

288
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:44,566
Good night.
Good night.

289
00:31:56,025 --> 00:31:57,693
Thank you, Edward.

290
00:31:58,734 --> 00:32:01,609
For what?
For being so nice.

291
00:32:31,276 --> 00:32:32,527
<i>In view of the fact</i>

292
00:32:32,527 --> 00:32:34,694
<i>we're taking a propaganda
lambasting around the world,</i>

293
00:32:36,069 --> 00:32:39,735
<i>why is it not useful, sir,
for us to explore with you</i>

294
00:32:39,902 --> 00:32:43,111
<i>the real facts behind this,
or our motivations?</i>

295
00:32:44,111 --> 00:32:48,403
<i>There's an old saying that
victory has a hundred fathers
and defeat is an orphan.</i>

296
00:32:48,902 --> 00:32:50,695
<i>And I wouldn't be surprised</i>

297
00:32:50,778 --> 00:32:53,945
<i>if information poured
in here regarding...</i>

298
00:32:55,277 --> 00:32:56,403
Hello, Edward.

299
00:33:00,528 --> 00:33:02,237
What are you doing here?

300
00:33:02,778 --> 00:33:05,444
There were only a handful
of us until moment zero

301
00:33:05,528 --> 00:33:08,028
who knew where we were
going to land in Cuba.

302
00:33:09,487 --> 00:33:11,612
One of us
couldn't keep a secret.

303
00:33:13,445 --> 00:33:15,237
I know it wasn't me.

304
00:33:15,779 --> 00:33:18,862
Mr. Allen asked for
the Zapata list of personnel

305
00:33:18,904 --> 00:33:20,737
who participated
in the operation.

306
00:33:22,612 --> 00:33:23,737
I don't have one.

307
00:33:23,862 --> 00:33:25,737
Tell Mr. Allen I'll give him
the list personally.

308
00:33:25,779 --> 00:33:27,696
We're in the same boat
together.

309
00:33:29,404 --> 00:33:30,737
A leaky boat.

310
00:33:30,779 --> 00:33:32,737
Don't ever think
we're in the same boat,
Mr. Hayes.

311
00:33:32,821 --> 00:33:36,071
We're either going to sink
or swim together.

312
00:33:38,779 --> 00:33:42,862
People like us,
we don't let each other drown.

313
00:33:51,363 --> 00:33:56,030
<i>I have said as much as I feel
can be usefully said by me</i>

314
00:33:56,572 --> 00:33:59,697
<i>in regard to the events
of the past few days.</i>

315
00:33:59,697 --> 00:34:03,573
<i>Further statements,
detailed discussions,</i>

316
00:34:04,322 --> 00:34:07,197
<i>are not
to conceal responsibility,</i>

317
00:34:07,239 --> 00:34:09,239
<i>because I'm the responsible
officer of the government...</i>

318
00:34:17,781 --> 00:34:19,447
Mother, Father.

319
00:34:20,364 --> 00:34:21,781
This is Edward Wilson.

320
00:34:21,823 --> 00:34:23,115
Mrs. Russell.
Hello.

321
00:34:23,240 --> 00:34:25,781
Senator.
Yes. It's a pleasure
to finally meet you.

322
00:34:26,198 --> 00:34:28,115
Phillip and Toddy Allen.

323
00:34:28,948 --> 00:34:32,198
Mr. Allen was
President of Bones,
Class of '12.

324
00:34:32,365 --> 00:34:34,699
Welcome to
our little clubhouse.
Thank you.

325
00:34:34,865 --> 00:34:36,031
Where's Clover?

326
00:34:36,365 --> 00:34:37,948
Oh, there she is.

327
00:34:38,073 --> 00:34:39,740
I think so. Yes.

328
00:34:41,782 --> 00:34:43,866
This is my sister, Clover.

329
00:34:44,323 --> 00:34:46,116
Hello, I'm Edward.
Nice to meet you.

330
00:34:46,199 --> 00:34:47,824
Nice to meet you.

331
00:34:50,407 --> 00:34:51,448
Bonesmen!

332
00:34:53,116 --> 00:34:55,032
- All here!
- All here!

333
00:34:56,074 --> 00:34:58,449
Reverend Collins
will offer grace.

334
00:34:58,449 --> 00:35:00,575
Bonesmen first,
God second.

335
00:35:00,741 --> 00:35:04,199
Dear God,
we thank you for guiding
the Evans Family Trust

336
00:35:04,324 --> 00:35:06,783
in the care
of our beloved island,

337
00:35:07,408 --> 00:35:10,867
so that we may come here
with our families
and our friends

338
00:35:10,950 --> 00:35:13,366
in comfort and in privacy.

339
00:35:21,075 --> 00:35:23,450
He said he was gonna
ask me to dance later.

340
00:35:25,033 --> 00:35:25,950
Here we go.

341
00:35:42,951 --> 00:35:45,993
Don't you dance, Mr. Wilson?
Nobody asked me.

342
00:35:49,909 --> 00:35:50,868
Well,

343
00:35:52,118 --> 00:35:54,410
I think I'll take my chances.

344
00:35:56,577 --> 00:35:57,910
I'm asking.

345
00:36:17,869 --> 00:36:21,244
John is very fond of you.
And I'm very fond of him.

346
00:36:21,453 --> 00:36:24,119
He's talking of going off
to fight with the English.

347
00:36:24,494 --> 00:36:27,119
My father isn't particularly
pleased about it

348
00:36:27,202 --> 00:36:30,120
because he's
one of the organizers
of America First.

349
00:36:30,578 --> 00:36:33,870
Wouldn't look very good
for an isolationist's son
to go off to war, would it?

350
00:36:33,911 --> 00:36:37,619
Your brother John is a man
of great conviction.
I admire him.

351
00:36:38,203 --> 00:36:41,203
And what about you,
Mr. Wilson?
What do you believe in?

352
00:36:43,911 --> 00:36:45,537
Are you in school?

353
00:36:52,620 --> 00:36:54,954
You don't say very much,
do you?

354
00:36:56,287 --> 00:36:58,245
When there's something
worth saying.

355
00:36:59,370 --> 00:37:00,871
Oh! Well.

356
00:37:01,787 --> 00:37:03,912
I think I'm going to like you.

357
00:37:10,871 --> 00:37:12,246
Mr. Hayes.

358
00:37:12,705 --> 00:37:14,038
Gentlemen.

359
00:37:20,621 --> 00:37:23,538
General William Sullivan,
Mr. Edward Wilson.

360
00:37:23,872 --> 00:37:25,371
It's a great honor, sir.

361
00:37:25,455 --> 00:37:28,371
I'd get up and shake
your hand, but my fucking
feet are killing me.

362
00:37:28,413 --> 00:37:31,913
Something about too much sugar
in my blood and my urine.

363
00:37:32,039 --> 00:37:33,747
So when do you boys start
your pissing contest?

364
00:37:36,372 --> 00:37:38,872
I'll excuse myself.

365
00:37:41,414 --> 00:37:42,664
Thank you, Phillip.

366
00:37:46,622 --> 00:37:48,289
Why don't you sit down?

367
00:38:00,165 --> 00:38:02,956
You understand that whatever
we discuss here
doesn't leave this room.

368
00:38:04,623 --> 00:38:05,873
Of course.

369
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:08,914
We'll eventually
get involved in this war.

370
00:38:09,248 --> 00:38:12,373
Not because we want to,
but because we have to,
and we should.

371
00:38:13,041 --> 00:38:16,290
And the President has asked me
to look into creating a
Foreign Intelligence Service.

372
00:38:16,373 --> 00:38:20,249
And if that happens,
I'll be looking for patriotic,
honorable, bright young men

373
00:38:20,291 --> 00:38:23,582
from the right backgrounds
to manage
the various departments.

374
00:38:23,665 --> 00:38:25,707
In other words,
no Jews or Negroes,

375
00:38:25,790 --> 00:38:28,749
and very few Catholics,
and that's only because
I'm a Catholic.

376
00:38:31,624 --> 00:38:34,541
You'd be trained
and commissioned in the Army
and posted overseas.

377
00:38:34,708 --> 00:38:36,124
If it's something
you're interested in,

378
00:38:36,207 --> 00:38:38,541
you have to be ready to leave
at a moment's notice.

379
00:38:40,541 --> 00:38:43,374
I don't want your answer now.
Just think about it.

380
00:38:43,374 --> 00:38:46,916
But this isn't a bunch of
fraternity boys sitting around
playing with their pricks.

381
00:38:47,042 --> 00:38:49,375
This is for real.
For America.

382
00:39:00,250 --> 00:39:02,417
Have fun.
And behave yourselves.

383
00:39:08,084 --> 00:39:10,917
I'm supposed to be looking
for the perfect husband.

384
00:39:11,292 --> 00:39:13,917
Are you the perfect husband,
Mr. Wilson?

385
00:39:15,168 --> 00:39:17,001
Perfect in every way.

386
00:39:22,209 --> 00:39:26,460
Then is there some reason
that you won't put
your arm around me?

387
00:39:29,209 --> 00:39:32,126
<i>Day and night</i>

388
00:39:33,710 --> 00:39:37,376
<i>Night and day</i>

389
00:39:38,418 --> 00:39:40,585
<i>You are the one</i>

390
00:39:42,127 --> 00:39:43,377
I like this.

391
00:39:43,919 --> 00:39:45,294
Very smart.

392
00:39:48,919 --> 00:39:51,377
<i>And under the sun</i>

393
00:39:54,753 --> 00:39:56,586
<i>...near to me</i>

394
00:39:58,711 --> 00:40:01,711
Do you have a problem
with women, Mr. Bones?

395
00:40:36,545 --> 00:40:37,879
Do you love me?

396
00:40:37,962 --> 00:40:40,129
What?
Tell me you love me.

397
00:40:40,588 --> 00:40:41,795
I love you.

398
00:40:42,213 --> 00:40:43,463
Do you love me?

399
00:40:43,546 --> 00:40:45,546
I do. I love you. I...
I still don't believe you.

400
00:40:45,755 --> 00:40:48,213
I love you.
Say it. Say it.

401
00:40:48,463 --> 00:40:49,588
I love you.
I think I love you...

402
00:40:49,713 --> 00:40:51,087
Look at me.
Look at me! Stop. Stop.

403
00:40:51,213 --> 00:40:53,505
Tell me!
I love you!
I think I love you.

404
00:41:08,755 --> 00:41:12,547
As soon as the world
comes to its senses,
I'm going to travel.

405
00:41:14,214 --> 00:41:17,297
London. Paris. Rome.

406
00:41:20,380 --> 00:41:22,006
You can come with me.

407
00:41:29,631 --> 00:41:31,631
Is everything all right?

408
00:41:35,881 --> 00:41:37,215
Fine.

409
00:41:40,715 --> 00:41:42,590
We're worlds apart.

410
00:41:44,757 --> 00:41:46,089
What do you mean?

411
00:41:46,590 --> 00:41:49,256
I feel like
I'm just a curiosity to you.

412
00:41:50,465 --> 00:41:52,632
That is not...
That's not true.

413
00:41:52,757 --> 00:41:56,632
I feel like
I'm not real to you.
That is not true.

414
00:41:56,632 --> 00:41:59,466
Edward.
That is not
how I feel about you.

415
00:42:07,965 --> 00:42:09,216
Edward?

416
00:42:27,758 --> 00:42:29,133
John.

417
00:42:29,634 --> 00:42:32,008
I've been looking
everywhere for you.

418
00:42:37,675 --> 00:42:39,759
My sister.
She's pregnant.

419
00:42:50,926 --> 00:42:53,385
I know you'll do
what's expected of you.

420
00:43:02,426 --> 00:43:07,259
<i>Do you,
Edward Bell Wilson,
take Margaret Ann Russell</i>

421
00:43:07,551 --> 00:43:10,135
<i>to be your
lawfully wedded wife?</i>

422
00:43:10,968 --> 00:43:13,385
<i>To love, honor and cherish</i>

423
00:43:14,135 --> 00:43:16,593
<i>in sickness and in health</i>

424
00:43:16,843 --> 00:43:21,386
<i>in good times
and in bad times,
until death do you part?</i>

425
00:43:22,010 --> 00:43:23,260
<i>I do.</i>

426
00:43:23,302 --> 00:43:25,552
<i>I now pronounce you
man and wife.</i>

427
00:43:41,136 --> 00:43:43,552
A man in uniform
wants to see you.

428
00:43:44,095 --> 00:43:45,886
Excuse me, Mother.

429
00:43:46,886 --> 00:43:50,261
Did your mother and I
ever tell you where
we took our honeymoon?

430
00:43:52,762 --> 00:43:54,095
Mr. Edward Wilson?

431
00:43:54,929 --> 00:43:56,637
If we could
speak alone, sir.

432
00:43:57,428 --> 00:44:00,137
Would you like to sit down?
No, thank you, sir.

433
00:44:00,178 --> 00:44:02,096
General Sullivan
sends his regards.

434
00:44:02,137 --> 00:44:05,470
He wanted to ask you, sir,
if you're still interested in
seeing the rest of the world.

435
00:44:06,221 --> 00:44:08,304
Yes, I certainly would be.

436
00:44:11,179 --> 00:44:13,471
Good afternoon, sir.
Thank you.

437
00:44:31,721 --> 00:44:34,763
My orders came through.
I'll be going overseas.

438
00:44:36,763 --> 00:44:37,888
When?

439
00:44:39,347 --> 00:44:40,888
In one week.

440
00:44:42,013 --> 00:44:45,180
What are you going to do,
Edward? Save the world?

441
00:45:01,014 --> 00:45:03,098
<i>You are safe
here with me.</i>

442
00:45:08,598 --> 00:45:10,598
The photograph
is particularly dark.

443
00:45:10,807 --> 00:45:14,765
As we can see,
there is a Caucasian man
and a Negro woman.

444
00:45:15,390 --> 00:45:17,139
The resolution breaks down
pretty quickly.

445
00:45:18,139 --> 00:45:20,807
The film stock
is definitely Russian,
low grade.

446
00:45:23,890 --> 00:45:27,140
One of the areas
we've been focusing on
is the mosquito netting.

447
00:45:27,224 --> 00:45:30,974
Mosquito netting
is predominantly in Africa,
Southeast Asia,

448
00:45:31,015 --> 00:45:32,307
any tropical climate.

449
00:45:32,432 --> 00:45:37,724
The window curtains here
have a distinctive pattern
on them of baobab trees,

450
00:45:37,848 --> 00:45:39,391
also seen in Africa.

451
00:45:40,266 --> 00:45:43,683
Next to the curtains,
we can see
the building's balustrade.

452
00:45:44,224 --> 00:45:47,224
There's a pigeon here.
It's kind of hard to make out.

453
00:45:47,266 --> 00:45:50,267
Pigeons are mostly found
in urban areas, town squares.

454
00:45:50,391 --> 00:45:52,975
If you listen closely,
you'll hear an airplane.

455
00:45:54,933 --> 00:45:56,225
We've washed it out.

456
00:45:59,433 --> 00:46:01,475
By the sound of the thrust
of the jet engines,

457
00:46:01,642 --> 00:46:03,725
we can determine that
it's a plane taking off,

458
00:46:03,809 --> 00:46:05,350
and more than 1,000 feet
off the ground,

459
00:46:05,433 --> 00:46:07,809
which would further suggest
a large urban area.

460
00:46:08,141 --> 00:46:10,559
On this section of the tape,
when you clear out
background noise,

461
00:46:10,642 --> 00:46:12,017
you can hear a female voice.

462
00:46:12,059 --> 00:46:13,475
<i>I love you.</i>

463
00:46:14,517 --> 00:46:17,892
<i>People who really love
each other don't have secrets.</i>

464
00:46:18,059 --> 00:46:19,309
<i>You are safe here with me.</i>

465
00:46:19,393 --> 00:46:20,892
Assuming we're talking about
the same woman,

466
00:46:20,934 --> 00:46:23,059
the linguists tell us
her accent is French.

467
00:46:25,059 --> 00:46:27,560
There's one word here,
we can't make it out yet.

468
00:46:28,393 --> 00:46:31,309
There's an unidentifiable
noise washing her out.

469
00:46:33,768 --> 00:46:36,142
It plays
throughout the recording
at a high frequency,

470
00:46:36,184 --> 00:46:38,810
suggesting an air-raid siren
of some sort.

471
00:46:39,393 --> 00:46:41,185
We're gonna keep
playing with it.

472
00:46:43,977 --> 00:46:47,476
<i>This is a time
for everyone to stand together
and hold firm</i>

473
00:46:48,935 --> 00:46:50,310
<i>as they are doing.</i>

474
00:46:51,435 --> 00:46:53,561
<i>I express my admiration</i>

475
00:46:54,144 --> 00:46:55,810
<i>for the exemplary manner</i>

476
00:46:55,977 --> 00:46:59,352
<i>in which all the air-raid
precaution services of London</i>

477
00:46:59,477 --> 00:47:01,018
<i>are being discharged.</i>

478
00:47:01,102 --> 00:47:02,435
<i>- May I help you?
- Yes.</i>

479
00:47:02,477 --> 00:47:05,061
<i>I'm here to see the tailor
about a fitting
for a new suit.</i>

480
00:47:05,144 --> 00:47:07,936
Certainly. And what
kind of suit would you be
interested in this evening?

481
00:47:07,978 --> 00:47:10,477
A tweed or worsted?
Perhaps a nice gabardine?

482
00:47:10,561 --> 00:47:12,727
Perhaps a worsted
and a tweed.

483
00:47:12,811 --> 00:47:14,769
Both single-breasted?
Yes.

484
00:47:14,894 --> 00:47:17,727
Two or three buttons, sir?
Three buttons.

485
00:47:20,562 --> 00:47:22,436
If you might come this way,
please, sir.

486
00:47:31,311 --> 00:47:33,812
Please. Our senior tailor
will be right with you, sir.

487
00:47:33,895 --> 00:47:35,395
Thank you.

488
00:47:44,645 --> 00:47:46,396
Welcome to London.

489
00:47:48,563 --> 00:47:52,396
You're going to have to learn
as quickly and thoroughly
as possible

490
00:47:52,438 --> 00:47:55,813
the English system
of intelligence.
The black arts.

491
00:47:55,980 --> 00:47:57,813
Particularly
counterintelligence.

492
00:47:58,813 --> 00:48:01,771
The uses of information,
disinformation,

493
00:48:02,438 --> 00:48:05,980
and how their use is,
ultimately, power.

494
00:48:11,397 --> 00:48:14,105
They've agreed to open
their operations to us.

495
00:48:15,647 --> 00:48:19,522
They can't win the war
without us, but they don't
really want us here.

496
00:48:19,564 --> 00:48:23,147
Intelligence is their
mother's milk and they don't
like sharing the royal tit

497
00:48:23,272 --> 00:48:25,731
with people
who don't have titles.

498
00:48:25,772 --> 00:48:28,064
Your London tutor is waiting
to meet you.

499
00:48:28,522 --> 00:48:30,064
This way, sir.

500
00:48:34,106 --> 00:48:36,647
...six-five megacycles
at one, three, five, nine.

501
00:48:38,231 --> 00:48:42,273
Eight point
seven-six-five megacycles
at one, three, five, nine.

502
00:48:47,982 --> 00:48:51,189
Four, two,
zero, seven. Standing by.

503
00:48:51,273 --> 00:48:54,773
...point
seven-six-five megacycles
at one, three, five, nine.

504
00:48:56,149 --> 00:48:59,399
I should have known better
than to use Stickney.

505
00:48:59,523 --> 00:49:03,482
Job well done, Mr. Wilson.
You blew a two-year operation
for me.

506
00:49:04,566 --> 00:49:08,940
I told General Sullivan
to keep an eye on you.
Just as well, really.

507
00:49:09,232 --> 00:49:12,941
I was beginning to long
for the bone-chilling cold
of home.

508
00:49:17,232 --> 00:49:19,108
It isn't personal.

509
00:49:24,316 --> 00:49:27,442
Mr. Carlson? Is this
the American Trade Bureau?

510
00:49:27,483 --> 00:49:28,983
Which product?

511
00:49:31,567 --> 00:49:32,899
Dry goods.

512
00:49:32,983 --> 00:49:35,899
You're late.
Yeah.
That's what my mother said.

513
00:49:38,233 --> 00:49:42,692
Raymond Duca Brocco,
born May 8, 1907,
New York City.

514
00:49:43,067 --> 00:49:45,483
St. Ignatius High School,
Fordham University.

515
00:49:45,608 --> 00:49:47,567
Married Anita Delvecchio,
two children...

516
00:49:47,608 --> 00:49:48,900
Stephanie and David.

517
00:49:53,984 --> 00:49:56,900
Six-foot-two, 182 pounds,
black hair, brown eyes.

518
00:49:56,984 --> 00:49:59,651
Military record,
five years Intelligence.

519
00:50:00,318 --> 00:50:04,109
Anything you'd like to add?
Do you want to
look up my ass, too?

520
00:50:04,942 --> 00:50:06,484
You're working for me,
Sergeant Brocco.

521
00:50:06,609 --> 00:50:07,985
I'm working for the
United States government, sir.

522
00:50:08,067 --> 00:50:09,818
In this office, I am
the United States government.

523
00:50:09,943 --> 00:50:12,818
You're pretty sure of yourself
for somebody who just began.

524
00:50:12,860 --> 00:50:13,943
They wouldn't
tell me your name.

525
00:50:13,985 --> 00:50:15,818
Then how do you know
you're not in the wrong place?

526
00:50:15,901 --> 00:50:19,152
They said you were
a serious SOB that didn't
have any sense of humor.

527
00:50:19,277 --> 00:50:21,068
There can't be two of you.

528
00:50:30,652 --> 00:50:31,943
Are you going to answer it?

529
00:50:32,152 --> 00:50:33,736
Depends if I'm working for you
or if I'm not.

530
00:50:33,819 --> 00:50:36,485
One of your jobs, Sergeant,
is answering the telephone.

531
00:50:37,277 --> 00:50:38,819
Yes, sir.

532
00:50:43,485 --> 00:50:47,611
Use your tradecraft well,
particularly the use
of black propaganda

533
00:50:47,652 --> 00:50:49,944
and the ingredient
known as playback.

534
00:50:49,986 --> 00:50:52,278
Understanding how effectively
your own disinformation

535
00:50:52,320 --> 00:50:53,944
is actually working
on the enemy.

536
00:50:56,403 --> 00:50:57,653
It's almost four.

537
00:50:57,695 --> 00:50:59,570
How do you spell syphilis?
Is it one "L" or two?

538
00:50:59,653 --> 00:51:03,904
Syphilis. One, I think.
I never had it.

539
00:51:04,737 --> 00:51:08,237
It's vital to penetrate
the enemy's
intelligence services.

540
00:51:08,320 --> 00:51:10,904
Push them into
an unreal world, as it were.

541
00:51:10,945 --> 00:51:12,112
<i>Doctors in England today</i>

542
00:51:12,154 --> 00:51:15,612
<i>announced that medical records
taken from Adolf Hitler's
personal physician,</i>

543
00:51:15,737 --> 00:51:19,321
<i>Dr. Theodor Morell,
revealed that Mr. Hitler
had contracted syphilis</i>

544
00:51:19,404 --> 00:51:22,446
<i>while serving
in the German armed forces
during World War I.</i>

545
00:51:22,738 --> 00:51:25,946
<i>The very qualities
that make
a good intelligence officer,</i>

546
00:51:26,029 --> 00:51:30,279
<i>a suspicious mind,
a love of complexity
and detail,</i>

547
00:51:30,779 --> 00:51:33,946
<i>are the very qualities
of someone
you'll be observing.</i>

548
00:51:45,572 --> 00:51:47,030
Good evening, Lord Cooper.

549
00:51:47,071 --> 00:51:49,572
I have some information
that might be of interest
to you.

550
00:51:49,822 --> 00:51:53,322
<i>The mental
facility to detect
conspiracies and betrayal</i>

551
00:51:53,405 --> 00:51:57,405
<i>are the same qualities
most likely to corrode
natural judgment.</i>

552
00:51:57,447 --> 00:52:02,739
Everything that seems clear
is bent. And everything
that seems bent is clear.

553
00:52:03,281 --> 00:52:04,655
Trapped in reflections,

554
00:52:04,739 --> 00:52:08,780
you must learn to recognize
when a lie masquerades
as the truth,

555
00:52:08,822 --> 00:52:11,615
and then deal with it
efficiently, dispassionately.

556
00:52:11,947 --> 00:52:14,740
We know you've
been passing information
to the German High Command.

557
00:52:14,781 --> 00:52:16,781
<i>Never give anyone
time to think.</i>

558
00:52:16,823 --> 00:52:19,156
Now, I'm going to offer you
one of two choices.

559
00:52:19,239 --> 00:52:22,490
You set the tone
of the discussion
and quickly come to the point.

560
00:52:22,573 --> 00:52:24,907
Either you can be executed
for treason,

561
00:52:24,948 --> 00:52:26,740
or you can continue to spy
for the enemy here

562
00:52:26,823 --> 00:52:29,490
and provide them
with the information
we provide you with.

563
00:52:29,573 --> 00:52:32,407
Pass this on
to your German friends. And
if I find out it wasn't done,

564
00:52:32,449 --> 00:52:33,698
there won't be
a second chance.

565
00:52:33,740 --> 00:52:36,907
You'll quite simply
be hanged as a spy.
Do we understand each other?

566
00:52:37,073 --> 00:52:39,324
How do we know
he won't be working
for two masters?

567
00:52:39,407 --> 00:52:41,616
Precisely. We don't.

568
00:52:42,616 --> 00:52:45,908
How do I know
if I can even trust you?
You won't.

569
00:52:46,824 --> 00:52:49,657
I mean, I hope
you're lucky enough
to meet someone you trust.

570
00:52:50,782 --> 00:52:52,449
I regret to say

571
00:52:53,158 --> 00:52:54,491
I haven't.

572
00:52:59,241 --> 00:53:00,824
You must be young Edward.

573
00:53:00,949 --> 00:53:03,283
Dr. Fredericks has told me
so much about you.

574
00:53:03,325 --> 00:53:04,824
Arch Cummings.
Nice to meet you.

575
00:53:04,949 --> 00:53:06,824
Nice to meet you.

576
00:53:06,908 --> 00:53:09,408
I understand we're of
a like mind on many things.

577
00:53:09,533 --> 00:53:12,074
Good schoolboys,
Yale, Cambridge.

578
00:53:12,867 --> 00:53:14,158
Dreamers.

579
00:53:15,116 --> 00:53:18,575
They say to be an exceptional
intelligence officer,

580
00:53:18,825 --> 00:53:20,159
you have to have
a steady mind,

581
00:53:20,242 --> 00:53:24,242
an unwavering sense of belief
in what you're doing,

582
00:53:24,784 --> 00:53:27,075
and be a hopeless romantic.

583
00:53:31,075 --> 00:53:32,659
American Trade Bureau.

584
00:53:34,785 --> 00:53:37,618
It's overseas,
a Senator Russell for you.

585
00:53:43,785 --> 00:53:44,785
Hello?

586
00:53:47,993 --> 00:53:50,493
Yes. Yeah.
Yes, I can hear you.

587
00:53:54,577 --> 00:53:56,327
Thank you for telling me.

588
00:53:57,077 --> 00:53:58,702
Goodbye.

589
00:54:03,243 --> 00:54:04,744
We had a boy.

590
00:54:06,452 --> 00:54:10,827
Would you mind
if we called him Edward? If we
called him Edward Junior?

591
00:54:10,911 --> 00:54:14,786
<i>I love that.
I think it's perfect.
Fit for a king.</i>

592
00:54:15,328 --> 00:54:18,911
<i>That's what I was thinking.
Fit for a king.
You like Edward?</i>

593
00:54:21,036 --> 00:54:22,827
<i>I think he likes it.</i>

594
00:54:23,952 --> 00:54:26,161
<i>So, how are you? Are you</i>

595
00:54:27,119 --> 00:54:29,536
<i>saving the world
and keeping us safe?</i>

596
00:54:29,578 --> 00:54:30,912
Sometimes.

597
00:54:31,870 --> 00:54:34,078
What color are his eyes?

598
00:54:35,995 --> 00:54:37,411
Hello?

599
00:54:37,661 --> 00:54:38,912
Hello?

600
00:54:46,745 --> 00:54:48,745
<i>When he's old enough,
you can read it to him.</i>

601
00:54:49,661 --> 00:54:51,245
It's a first edition.

602
00:54:51,454 --> 00:54:54,579
<i>Charles Dickens'
A Christmas Carol.
It was my father's.</i>

603
00:54:54,746 --> 00:54:57,162
He would read it to me
when I was a boy.

604
00:54:57,662 --> 00:54:58,954
Thank you.

605
00:55:00,996 --> 00:55:03,704
I had an unfortunate
discovery today.

606
00:55:04,496 --> 00:55:07,163
A man that works for me,
sat just outside my door.

607
00:55:07,288 --> 00:55:10,954
I found out he had given
a rose to a woman
with a small note.

608
00:55:10,996 --> 00:55:13,829
The rose was quite lovely,
an Abyssinian rose,

609
00:55:13,913 --> 00:55:18,330
its stem neatly wrapped
in silk paper. All quite
beautiful and touching,

610
00:55:18,497 --> 00:55:23,330
save for the fact that the
paper was filled with secret
writing for her German friends

611
00:55:23,413 --> 00:55:26,955
detailing changes
to the American order
of battle here.

612
00:55:28,413 --> 00:55:29,372
Excuse me, sir.

613
00:55:31,081 --> 00:55:33,081
Thank you.
Thank you, sir.

614
00:55:34,122 --> 00:55:36,289
How did the Irish poet say it?

615
00:55:36,664 --> 00:55:41,122
"A friend for today
is tomorrow's heartbreak."

616
00:55:42,081 --> 00:55:46,665
Do you know
what my deepest fear is?
That I will end up friendless.

617
00:55:47,706 --> 00:55:49,331
Completely alone.

618
00:55:52,164 --> 00:55:54,539
I think you two
know each other.

619
00:55:55,082 --> 00:55:57,665
Richard. I didn't expect
to see you.
Hello, Edward.

620
00:55:57,665 --> 00:56:00,790
Mr. Hayes has come over
to work with us
in Special Operations.

621
00:56:01,040 --> 00:56:04,957
I hope you don't mind,
I've invited him to join
our conversation.

622
00:56:14,791 --> 00:56:18,499
I'm afraid our dear English
teacher has a bad habit
of making easy friendships.

623
00:56:22,165 --> 00:56:25,666
You know, of course,
about his particular
sexual tastes.

624
00:56:30,333 --> 00:56:34,124
I'm afraid he's not been
very discriminating
in his partners.

625
00:56:34,749 --> 00:56:37,874
Some people are extremely
worried about his exposure.

626
00:56:41,750 --> 00:56:45,291
I hope you two can help sort
this rather delicate matter
out for us.

627
00:57:00,667 --> 00:57:03,125
This seems to me
to be a problem
for the British.

628
00:57:03,292 --> 00:57:05,125
Why are we involved?

629
00:57:06,917 --> 00:57:09,334
The British are
a civilized people.

630
00:57:09,668 --> 00:57:13,459
They don't eat their own.
They have somebody
do it for them.

631
00:57:15,417 --> 00:57:17,334
So why are you telling me?

632
00:57:17,876 --> 00:57:22,001
I'm giving you
an opportunity to handle it.
Or somebody else will.

633
00:57:38,585 --> 00:57:40,961
I'm sorry
you've been brought into this.

634
00:57:42,794 --> 00:57:46,752
If the headmaster won't
listen to reason, you might
want to tie your shoe.

635
00:57:48,127 --> 00:57:50,211
I'm sorry
it has to be this way.

636
00:57:51,044 --> 00:57:54,336
It's not something I'm happy
about having to be doing.

637
00:58:06,878 --> 00:58:11,419
Have you thought at all about
maybe going back to teaching
again full-time?

638
00:58:12,461 --> 00:58:16,295
They're concerned about
my personal associations,
aren't they?

639
00:58:16,795 --> 00:58:19,628
Cambridge boys stick together
like glue.

640
00:58:20,587 --> 00:58:23,128
I'm far too democratic
in my tastes for them.

641
00:58:24,128 --> 00:58:27,170
They like pressed trousers
and proper buttons.

642
00:58:28,921 --> 00:58:32,504
No. I've done all the teaching
I intend to do.

643
00:58:33,921 --> 00:58:35,504
I am who I am.

644
00:58:37,295 --> 00:58:38,921
I'll suffer that.

645
00:58:43,130 --> 00:58:46,421
Please. You've given
all the service that you can.

646
00:58:47,921 --> 00:58:49,672
It's time to retire.

647
00:58:52,755 --> 00:58:55,255
The good schoolboy
will be close by.

648
00:58:56,130 --> 00:58:58,255
He'll want to know
my response.

649
00:59:01,421 --> 00:59:04,463
I understand if you want
to tie your shoe.

650
00:59:07,297 --> 00:59:11,839
It's a dirty business, Edward.
I've been part of it
for far too long.

651
00:59:32,257 --> 00:59:36,340
You might want to think
about getting yourself
a new pair of shoes, Edward.

652
00:59:38,424 --> 00:59:40,798
There's a wonderful shop
in St. James'.

653
00:59:41,090 --> 00:59:45,424
Mr. Pettibone's.
He's bootmaker to the King.

654
00:59:46,465 --> 00:59:49,799
But then, I suppose
we all are in our own way,
aren't we?

655
00:59:50,090 --> 00:59:51,924
Bootmakers to kings.

656
00:59:56,257 --> 00:59:58,465
Get out while you still can.

657
00:59:59,465 --> 01:00:01,465
While you still believe.

658
01:00:03,091 --> 01:00:05,216
While you still have a soul.

659
01:00:44,092 --> 01:00:46,843
Hello.
Any of you chaps
got a light?

660
01:01:50,845 --> 01:01:52,262
I'm sorry.

661
01:02:00,637 --> 01:02:02,262
He knew too much.

662
01:02:06,345 --> 01:02:07,846
You understand.

663
01:02:32,179 --> 01:02:34,139
<i>People who really love
each other don't have secrets.</i>

664
01:02:34,180 --> 01:02:35,805
<i>You are safe here with me.</i>

665
01:02:35,847 --> 01:02:37,597
It appears the word
we couldn't make out

666
01:02:37,680 --> 01:02:41,055
had its sound wave
significantly clipped by
whoever made this tape.

667
01:02:41,180 --> 01:02:44,638
We restored it by amplifying
specific frequencies
seen on the oscilloscope.

668
01:02:45,972 --> 01:02:49,514
<i>- Cochinos is Spanish
for "pigs."
- Let me hear it again.</i>

669
01:02:55,931 --> 01:02:59,598
And the siren noise
we couldn't pinpoint before
were hiding church bells.

670
01:03:02,764 --> 01:03:05,931
For some reason,
other noises were added
to distort the bells.

671
01:03:05,973 --> 01:03:09,098
In the makeup table's mirror,
you can actually make out
the reflection

672
01:03:09,140 --> 01:03:10,598
of a church steeple,

673
01:03:10,598 --> 01:03:13,557
whose three belfries
correspond with the bells
you hear.

674
01:03:16,015 --> 01:03:18,724
The volume indicates
that the church
is across the street,

675
01:03:18,765 --> 01:03:21,098
again, possibly
on a town square.

676
01:03:21,640 --> 01:03:24,348
On the nightstand,
we can see a clock radio.

677
01:03:26,016 --> 01:03:30,473
It reads almost 10:00,
which would correspond
with the church bells.

678
01:03:31,016 --> 01:03:33,515
I also have audio
of a ceiling fan.

679
01:03:34,682 --> 01:03:38,433
It's a four-blade,
standard ceiling fan.
We don't know where it's from.

680
01:03:38,516 --> 01:03:40,183
There is something here.

681
01:03:40,807 --> 01:03:44,766
It could be
nothing significant,
maybe a candle, a paperweight.

682
01:03:45,016 --> 01:03:46,308
Or it may be
something personal

683
01:03:46,433 --> 01:03:48,808
that we could identify
the people in the room with.

684
01:03:48,808 --> 01:03:51,850
We're going to wash it again,
maybe see what's there.

685
01:03:52,933 --> 01:03:56,349
How long
until there's some definition

686
01:03:56,433 --> 01:03:58,516
as to exactly where we are?

687
01:03:59,184 --> 01:04:01,350
We're going
as quickly as we can, sir.

688
01:04:11,684 --> 01:04:14,142
- How are Clover
and your little boy?
- Good, thank you.

689
01:04:14,184 --> 01:04:15,934
You know, he's almost five.

690
01:04:16,476 --> 01:04:18,684
You made quite a name
for yourself in London.

691
01:04:20,018 --> 01:04:21,767
The World War is over.

692
01:04:21,809 --> 01:04:23,309
The war for the world
has just begun.

693
01:04:23,434 --> 01:04:26,642
In every liberated country,
there will be a battle between
us and the Russians

694
01:04:26,684 --> 01:04:28,851
for their hearts and minds.

695
01:04:30,767 --> 01:04:34,143
Since we dropped the bomb,
they're feeling a little short
between the legs.

696
01:04:34,185 --> 01:04:38,143
The Russians still live
in the 19th century.
Beets and potatoes.

697
01:04:38,643 --> 01:04:42,310
All that will change
dramatically. Right now,
they're gobbling up territory,

698
01:04:42,477 --> 01:04:47,186
taking home every scientist
they can steal. In 10 years,
they'll have the bomb.

699
01:04:47,518 --> 01:04:51,810
We have to get anyone
that can be useful to us
out of Berlin before they do.

700
01:04:57,060 --> 01:04:59,144
Churchill was right.

701
01:04:59,186 --> 01:05:02,269
We shouldn't have
stopped marching
until we reached Moscow.

702
01:05:05,019 --> 01:05:06,644
They're from Switzerland.

703
01:05:06,686 --> 01:05:09,811
I had them sent
with the pouch to Berlin.

704
01:05:10,436 --> 01:05:12,103
They're a weakness of mine.

705
01:05:12,186 --> 01:05:15,811
When I was a child, my mother
would always reward me
with a chocolate.

706
01:05:18,103 --> 01:05:19,644
It's a dreadful habit.

707
01:05:20,187 --> 01:05:21,770
Chocolates
or seeking approval?

708
01:05:23,437 --> 01:05:24,686
Both.

709
01:05:26,978 --> 01:05:30,020
He was an officer
in the Abwehr,
German Military Intelligence.

710
01:05:33,353 --> 01:05:37,353
He says he knows the location
of certain Nazi V-2
rocket scientists in hiding.

711
01:05:37,479 --> 01:05:39,353
Ask him
where he wants to go.

712
01:05:43,104 --> 01:05:45,771
He wants to go to Chicago.
He has relatives there.

713
01:05:45,812 --> 01:05:49,271
Tell him if he provides us
with the names and locations
of the scientists,

714
01:05:49,354 --> 01:05:51,771
I'll arrange
an exit visa for him.

715
01:05:52,146 --> 01:05:55,605
As soon as he's
served his purpose, turn him
over to the Nazi catchers.

716
01:06:06,105 --> 01:06:10,605
An ex-Waffen-SS Group
Commander would like to speak
with you about asylum.

717
01:06:15,439 --> 01:06:16,980
It's very ugly, isn't it?

718
01:06:17,272 --> 01:06:19,272
It isn't meant to be jewelry.

719
01:06:20,938 --> 01:06:23,356
I lost the sound
in one ear altogether.

720
01:06:23,773 --> 01:06:27,356
I can hear with the help
of the apparatus
out of this ear,

721
01:06:27,481 --> 01:06:28,647
but they say
in one year or so...

722
01:06:28,773 --> 01:06:30,481
You hardly notice it's there.

723
01:06:37,606 --> 01:06:40,981
The Russians
are interested in making
a prisoner swap.

724
01:07:06,024 --> 01:07:10,774
We are prepared to offer you
some Jewish scientists
liberated in the East

725
01:07:10,815 --> 01:07:13,815
for some Nazi scientists
you have here in Berlin.

726
01:07:22,733 --> 01:07:25,025
These are the names
we're willing to discuss.

727
01:08:00,443 --> 01:08:04,276
I understand your cryptonym
for me is Ulysses.

728
01:08:05,276 --> 01:08:08,693
Is that for
the James Joyce book
or the Greek myth?

729
01:08:14,944 --> 01:08:17,652
Do you know
what our code name is for you?

730
01:08:21,902 --> 01:08:23,319
Mother.

731
01:08:27,027 --> 01:08:31,236
I took the first
hot bath yesterday
I've taken in three years,

732
01:08:31,277 --> 01:08:33,944
since the siege of Stalingrad.

733
01:08:35,653 --> 01:08:37,653
I sat for hours,

734
01:08:38,611 --> 01:08:40,486
looking out the window,

735
01:08:41,444 --> 01:08:43,111
soaking.

736
01:08:56,195 --> 01:08:59,695
When I was a soldier,
my fingers were frostbitten.

737
01:09:01,028 --> 01:09:03,445
Since then,
when I get cold,

738
01:09:04,362 --> 01:09:05,946
there is a pain.

739
01:09:08,987 --> 01:09:11,445
Maybe you shouldn't live
in Russia.

740
01:09:13,487 --> 01:09:15,612
We all have our weaknesses.

741
01:09:17,654 --> 01:09:19,029
What is yours?

742
01:09:22,321 --> 01:09:24,655
I had heard you were silent.

743
01:09:25,946 --> 01:09:28,112
"Made of stone," they said.

744
01:09:29,279 --> 01:09:34,154
What is the expression?
"The silence is deafening."

745
01:09:38,279 --> 01:09:42,696
You are going to be
a formidable adversary,
Mother.

746
01:09:52,364 --> 01:09:54,822
I look forward
to our association.

747
01:09:56,864 --> 01:09:59,280
I hope it lasts
for a long time.

748
01:10:15,448 --> 01:10:16,532
<i>I love you.</i>

749
01:10:17,948 --> 01:10:20,864
<i>People who really love
each other don't have secrets.</i>

750
01:10:21,782 --> 01:10:23,532
<i>You are safe here with me.</i>

751
01:10:23,657 --> 01:10:25,782
We were able
to make out the brand
of the fan.

752
01:10:25,865 --> 01:10:28,740
It's called a Froid.
It's Belgian.

753
01:10:28,782 --> 01:10:33,365
The object on the nightstand,
we're still trying to find out
what this is.

754
01:10:34,698 --> 01:10:36,490
We just can't get
any more definition out of it.

755
01:10:42,324 --> 01:10:43,990
<i>Who is this?</i>

756
01:10:45,324 --> 01:10:46,990
Who's this?

757
01:10:48,032 --> 01:10:51,074
<i>Hello, Father.
You have a birthday
coming up.</i>

758
01:10:51,366 --> 01:10:52,783
<i>I'm going to be five soon.</i>

759
01:10:54,157 --> 01:10:55,699
You're a big boy.

760
01:10:56,825 --> 01:10:59,366
<i>I'm bigger than Andrew,
and he's six.</i>

761
01:11:03,533 --> 01:11:06,658
<i>Is your mother there?
What? I can't hear you.</i>

762
01:11:09,158 --> 01:11:11,033
Is your mother there?

763
01:11:11,492 --> 01:11:13,866
<i>She's getting dressed
to go out with her friend.</i>

764
01:11:13,950 --> 01:11:16,492
<i>He has a new car.
He let me drive with him.</i>

765
01:11:19,450 --> 01:11:21,283
<i>Hello, Mr. Wilson.
This is Edna.</i>

766
01:11:21,659 --> 01:11:24,450
<i>Mrs. Wilson is upstairs.
She's getting ready
for dinner.</i>

767
01:11:24,492 --> 01:11:26,450
<i>I'll tell her
you're on the phone.</i>

768
01:11:28,826 --> 01:11:30,368
I'll call back.

769
01:11:37,951 --> 01:11:39,159
Pardon me.

770
01:11:40,660 --> 01:11:43,827
Do you need me
for anything else?
No, thank you.

771
01:11:52,910 --> 01:11:54,618
Do you ever eat, Mr. Carlson?

772
01:11:55,702 --> 01:11:59,160
I like to cook. Would you like
a home-cooked meal?

773
01:12:07,868 --> 01:12:11,077
<i>Have you ever read Ovid?
Metamorphoses
in the original Latin?</i>

774
01:12:12,452 --> 01:12:13,869
It's quite beautiful.

775
01:12:17,536 --> 01:12:21,036
"I grabbed a pile of dust
and, holding it up,

776
01:12:21,536 --> 01:12:25,370
"foolishly asked for
as many birthdays
as the grains of dust.

777
01:12:25,786 --> 01:12:28,703
"I forgot to ask that
they be years of youth."

778
01:12:30,036 --> 01:12:31,370
Bravo.

779
01:12:45,037 --> 01:12:46,662
I should be going.

780
01:12:54,787 --> 01:12:56,287
Would you like to stay?

781
01:12:59,579 --> 01:13:01,288
Would you like me to?

782
01:13:02,788 --> 01:13:04,997
I would like you to
very much.

783
01:13:14,371 --> 01:13:16,913
Maybe we could go
somewhere together?

784
01:13:17,038 --> 01:13:19,122
The lakes in Bavaria
are still beautiful.

785
01:13:20,539 --> 01:13:24,788
There was an inn there before
the war where they served
breakfast in bed all day.

786
01:13:49,206 --> 01:13:50,415
Hanna?

787
01:13:53,790 --> 01:13:55,665
I hope
you never go home.

788
01:13:58,039 --> 01:14:00,540
Bavaria is really
a beautiful place.

789
01:14:02,206 --> 01:14:06,249
I was born there.
My grandmother lived there.

790
01:14:07,540 --> 01:14:09,291
I really miss her.

791
01:14:10,999 --> 01:14:12,623
Why don't we go?

792
01:14:27,916 --> 01:14:30,208
I let a stranger
into our house.

793
01:15:40,377 --> 01:15:43,752
Mother! Father's here! Mother!

794
01:15:50,878 --> 01:15:52,211
Hello, Edward.

795
01:15:53,878 --> 01:15:55,420
Hello, Clover.

796
01:15:58,545 --> 01:15:59,587
I...

797
01:16:01,878 --> 01:16:04,378
I like to be called
Margaret now.

798
01:16:07,712 --> 01:16:09,795
It's very nice to see you.

799
01:16:11,462 --> 01:16:13,128
It's good to see you, too.

800
01:16:16,503 --> 01:16:18,336
I made something for you.

801
01:16:22,503 --> 01:16:24,795
See? It's a ship.

802
01:16:26,379 --> 01:16:29,212
But it's got
the flag of England.

803
01:16:31,379 --> 01:16:34,004
And then I put
a pirate flag there.

804
01:16:34,588 --> 01:16:36,796
And if you like,
you can count

805
01:16:37,463 --> 01:16:39,421
how many sails there are.

806
01:16:40,212 --> 01:16:42,046
You want to try that?

807
01:16:47,463 --> 01:16:48,588
Fifteen.

808
01:16:48,880 --> 01:16:50,255
That's right.

809
01:16:50,880 --> 01:16:52,297
Fifteen.

810
01:16:53,671 --> 01:16:56,297
No, no, it's yours.
I made it for you.

811
01:17:11,797 --> 01:17:13,839
If it's all right with you,

812
01:17:14,339 --> 01:17:16,881
I thought maybe we could sleep
in separate beds for a while,

813
01:17:16,922 --> 01:17:19,381
just until we get
to know each other again.

814
01:17:20,839 --> 01:17:22,715
I made up the spare room.

815
01:17:23,881 --> 01:17:25,214
All right.

816
01:17:33,882 --> 01:17:36,631
What do you hear
from your brother John?

817
01:17:39,715 --> 01:17:43,132
I thought you knew.
He was killed in Burma,
in 1944.

818
01:17:45,257 --> 01:17:48,340
You never mentioned it
in any of your letters.

819
01:17:50,840 --> 01:17:52,965
There wasn't very much to say.

820
01:18:01,050 --> 01:18:03,133
Six years is a long time.

821
01:18:06,924 --> 01:18:10,133
I was lonely
and I was with a man once.

822
01:18:13,799 --> 01:18:15,508
He wasn't very interesting.

823
01:18:19,592 --> 01:18:21,133
Were you with anyone?

824
01:18:23,967 --> 01:18:25,842
It was a mistake.

825
01:18:42,301 --> 01:18:45,176
Thank you for the ship
you made for me.

826
01:18:48,551 --> 01:18:49,843
You're welcome.

827
01:18:50,843 --> 01:18:52,509
I'm glad you like it.

828
01:18:54,593 --> 01:18:56,968
Mother said
you were in the war.

829
01:18:56,968 --> 01:18:59,968
Did you fight?
Did you kill anybody?

830
01:19:03,801 --> 01:19:05,135
No.

831
01:19:08,801 --> 01:19:11,260
Good night.
Good night.

832
01:19:29,428 --> 01:19:31,219
No! You're it!

833
01:19:31,802 --> 01:19:34,595
Hello, Father.
Hello, Edward. Hello.

834
01:19:34,886 --> 01:19:35,969
Hello, dear.

835
01:19:36,094 --> 01:19:37,553
There's somebody waiting
for you in the den.

836
01:19:40,637 --> 01:19:41,845
General.

837
01:19:43,803 --> 01:19:45,136
Edward.

838
01:19:46,803 --> 01:19:50,179
I'm sorry to barge in on you
like this. Your wife kindly
helped me to a drink.

839
01:19:52,220 --> 01:19:55,221
My feet,
they keep cutting off
pieces of them.

840
01:19:55,304 --> 01:19:58,137
It's not dignified for men
to have to die
from the feet up.

841
01:20:04,721 --> 01:20:07,512
Well, while everybody's been
feeling good about themselves,

842
01:20:07,763 --> 01:20:11,471
the Soviets,
without firing a shot, have
taken over half the world.

843
01:20:11,471 --> 01:20:13,138
They're breathing
down our necks.

844
01:20:13,179 --> 01:20:15,262
They'll be in our backyard
before you know it.

845
01:20:15,429 --> 01:20:16,679
So, I've been telling
the President

846
01:20:16,721 --> 01:20:19,138
about the need to create
a new
Foreign Intelligence Service.

847
01:20:19,180 --> 01:20:21,804
One that would do in peacetime
what OSS did during the war.

848
01:20:23,304 --> 01:20:26,471
Phillip Allen will be heading
the agency. Richard Hayes
will be his exec.

849
01:20:26,513 --> 01:20:28,054
And you'll be taking
Division C,

850
01:20:28,137 --> 01:20:30,805
special operations that report
only to the Director.

851
01:20:31,221 --> 01:20:33,554
It would be limited
to overseas, obviously.

852
01:20:33,638 --> 01:20:37,388
Subversive operations,
intelligence gathering
and analysis.

853
01:20:37,554 --> 01:20:40,805
And I'd be interested
in your thoughts about this.

854
01:20:41,388 --> 01:20:44,888
Particularly in your area
of expertise,
counterintelligence.

855
01:20:44,972 --> 01:20:47,471
I'd be glad to help
in any way I can.

856
01:20:47,554 --> 01:20:48,638
That's all right.

857
01:20:48,721 --> 01:20:50,721
Edward, go outside.

858
01:20:52,514 --> 01:20:54,555
Excuse me, sir. Margaret!

859
01:20:56,639 --> 01:20:58,305
Come on, Edward.

860
01:20:58,472 --> 01:21:00,972
Come. Let's go outside,
all right? Daddy's busy.

861
01:21:03,973 --> 01:21:05,305
Thank you.

862
01:21:14,223 --> 01:21:18,223
I have to tell you,
I have some real problems
with this whole thing,

863
01:21:18,306 --> 01:21:20,223
despite how much we need it.

864
01:21:21,139 --> 01:21:24,889
I'm concerned that
too much power will end up
in the hands of too few.

865
01:21:24,973 --> 01:21:28,640
It's always in somebody's
best interest to promote
enemies, real or imagined.

866
01:21:28,723 --> 01:21:33,807
I see this as America's eyes
and ears. I don't want it to
become its heart and soul.

867
01:21:35,473 --> 01:21:37,307
So I told the President,
for this to work,

868
01:21:37,390 --> 01:21:40,140
there's gonna have to be
some kind of civilian
oversight.

869
01:21:40,432 --> 01:21:41,890
Oversight?

870
01:21:42,640 --> 01:21:44,474
How can you have
a covert organization

871
01:21:44,599 --> 01:21:46,723
if you have people looking
over your shoulder?

872
01:21:46,807 --> 01:21:50,724
You know who gave Hitler
his power? The clerks
and the bookkeepers.

873
01:21:50,848 --> 01:21:52,391
The civil servants.

874
01:21:53,307 --> 01:21:55,391
I have this one weakness.

875
01:21:55,891 --> 01:21:57,724
I believe in a just God.

876
01:21:58,724 --> 01:22:01,474
I always seem to err
on the side of democracy.

877
01:22:08,016 --> 01:22:10,891
This must be a nice place
to raise a family.

878
01:22:10,975 --> 01:22:12,808
I never made the time.

879
01:22:13,808 --> 01:22:15,725
I'll be dead
in less than a year.

880
01:22:18,642 --> 01:22:20,308
I love this country.

881
01:22:20,809 --> 01:22:23,600
We all do, sir. We all do.

882
01:22:33,309 --> 01:22:37,184
No matter what anyone
tells you, there'll be
no one you can really trust.

883
01:22:41,143 --> 01:22:45,226
I'm afraid
when all is said and done,
we're all just clerks, too.

884
01:23:05,310 --> 01:23:09,018
I was under the impression
that Dr. Ibanez
supported a democracy.

885
01:23:09,144 --> 01:23:11,394
I'm afraid
he's changed his mind.

886
01:23:11,477 --> 01:23:13,894
The doctor's started
to believe
his own propaganda.

887
01:23:13,978 --> 01:23:16,769
I mean, you dreamed
this guy up, Edward,
helped get him elected.

888
01:23:16,811 --> 01:23:18,144
Those are the Soviets.

889
01:23:18,227 --> 01:23:20,227
International Department
of Central Committee members

890
01:23:20,310 --> 01:23:22,894
Trubnikov, Kushelnikov,

891
01:23:22,978 --> 01:23:25,894
who have become
overly interested
in their natural resources,

892
01:23:25,978 --> 01:23:27,395
particularly coffee.

893
01:23:29,145 --> 01:23:32,061
Our economic interests
are being compromised,

894
01:23:32,437 --> 01:23:36,478
to say nothing of the dangers
of a Soviet presence
so close to home.

895
01:23:37,894 --> 01:23:41,895
For security, Edward,
we must establish
our own presence there.

896
01:23:42,478 --> 01:23:44,395
Wait, stop. Can you go back?

897
01:23:45,311 --> 01:23:47,229
Go back a little bit.

898
01:23:50,812 --> 01:23:52,562
Run it from there.

899
01:24:07,146 --> 01:24:08,896
I just thought
I saw something.

900
01:24:08,980 --> 01:24:11,479
I want you two
to put your heads together
on this.

901
01:24:11,646 --> 01:24:14,980
Michael will be
going down there
as an agricultural specialist

902
01:24:15,063 --> 01:24:17,980
with the Mayan Coffee Company.
Non-official.

903
01:24:19,147 --> 01:24:21,063
He'll be our eyes and ears.

904
01:24:21,230 --> 01:24:23,230
Congratulations.
Thank you, sir.

905
01:24:23,564 --> 01:24:24,980
Good luck.
Thank you.

906
01:24:25,980 --> 01:24:28,230
I wouldn't wear
my class ring down there.

907
01:24:28,397 --> 01:24:29,564
Yes, sir. Of course.

908
01:24:29,647 --> 01:24:33,731
I want all intelligence
on this sent directly to me
and no one else.

909
01:24:37,480 --> 01:24:39,605
<i>I believe that's
what you're looking for.</i>

910
01:24:41,981 --> 01:24:43,480
That'll do it.

911
01:25:36,482 --> 01:25:40,649
Mr. Wilson?
This came for you through
the Carlson cover address.

912
01:25:41,899 --> 01:25:43,608
There was no card.

913
01:26:35,776 --> 01:26:38,860
There's been
a potential compromise
down south.

914
01:26:38,985 --> 01:26:40,319
Ulysses.

915
01:26:41,319 --> 01:26:43,068
We can't wait
another 24 hours.

916
01:26:43,152 --> 01:26:46,902
If you can guarantee that
all assets are in place and
prepared to move on my order,

917
01:26:46,986 --> 01:26:49,152
I'm prepared to move as well.

918
01:26:53,444 --> 01:26:55,069
Come back to bed.

919
01:26:56,028 --> 01:26:57,736
What were you talking about?

920
01:26:57,986 --> 01:26:59,694
It's grown-up talk.

921
01:27:00,777 --> 01:27:02,486
I had a nightmare.

922
01:27:02,986 --> 01:27:04,570
Everything's fine.

923
01:27:07,528 --> 01:27:09,570
Could you stay with me
another minute?

924
01:27:14,153 --> 01:27:15,403
Try to get some sleep.

925
01:27:18,486 --> 01:27:19,737
Yes?

926
01:27:21,070 --> 01:27:24,570
We haven't got time to be sure
on this. This whole thing
hinges on support.

927
01:27:24,820 --> 01:27:27,778
If we don't have the support,
I can't guarantee the outcome.

928
01:27:27,820 --> 01:27:29,820
Can you guarantee
the support?

929
01:27:30,987 --> 01:27:33,904
That's not a guarantee.
That's not an answer.

930
01:27:35,237 --> 01:27:39,070
Do what you have to do.
These men aren't ideological.

931
01:27:39,279 --> 01:27:42,237
Put more in their
Christmas stockings,
and they'll fall into place.

932
01:27:42,321 --> 01:27:45,905
Call the station chief.
Get him out of bed.

933
01:27:46,321 --> 01:27:48,613
Margaret tells us that
you work with the CIA.

934
01:27:51,654 --> 01:27:53,988
My wife has
a vivid imagination.

935
01:27:54,363 --> 01:27:57,030
I'm a trade advisor.
A civil servant.

936
01:28:07,071 --> 01:28:08,572
Good night.
Good night.

937
01:28:16,489 --> 01:28:17,780
How dare you speak
to me that way?

938
01:28:17,822 --> 01:28:19,448
You are never to tell anybody
what I do.

939
01:28:19,572 --> 01:28:22,031
How dare you?
Those people are my friends!
I don't have a lot of friends!

940
01:28:22,156 --> 01:28:25,239
You are never to tell anyone
what it is I do. Never.
Do you understand me?

941
01:28:25,323 --> 01:28:27,490
What you do? What you do?
I don't know what you do!

942
01:28:27,573 --> 01:28:29,989
You leave at five,
you're home at ten,
seven days a week.

943
01:28:30,072 --> 01:28:31,406
You don't say
a damn word to me!

944
01:28:31,490 --> 01:28:34,406
I live with a ghost!
I don't know what you do!

945
01:28:42,324 --> 01:28:43,656
Call back.

946
01:28:50,907 --> 01:28:53,407
They're ready.
Launch the operation.

947
01:28:54,657 --> 01:28:56,073
Say something.

948
01:28:56,407 --> 01:28:58,324
Say something.
I have to go now.

949
01:28:58,449 --> 01:29:01,240
Say something! Talk to me!
Say something!

950
01:29:01,324 --> 01:29:03,407
Look at me. Say something.

951
01:29:31,408 --> 01:29:34,909
Remember what I said.
Don't touch anything.
All right?

952
01:29:38,242 --> 01:29:40,992
Merry Christmas,
Margaret. Edward.
Merry Christmas.

953
01:29:41,117 --> 01:29:42,742
Is this young Edward?

954
01:29:42,784 --> 01:29:46,409
Would you like to come inside
and meet our very
special guest this evening?

955
01:29:50,743 --> 01:29:52,409
Santa Claus.

956
01:29:52,618 --> 01:29:54,326
- Would you like
to meet Santa?
- Yeah.

957
01:29:54,409 --> 01:29:55,576
Come along.

958
01:29:56,077 --> 01:29:58,659
Toddy is wonderful
with children.
Yes, she is.

959
01:29:58,743 --> 01:30:00,576
Come and meet Santa.

960
01:30:02,826 --> 01:30:05,743
Would you like a drink,
Edward?
Thank you.

961
01:30:07,202 --> 01:30:09,910
I believe
congratulations are in order.

962
01:30:10,868 --> 01:30:14,410
The doctor has
no more patients
because of malpractice.

963
01:30:17,327 --> 01:30:19,077
Gentlemen.
Edward.

964
01:30:22,911 --> 01:30:24,161
Phillip.

965
01:30:24,369 --> 01:30:25,494
Bill.

966
01:30:25,952 --> 01:30:27,244
Gentlemen,

967
01:30:27,994 --> 01:30:31,161
you can all be very proud
of what you've started.

968
01:30:34,660 --> 01:30:35,744
Merry Christmas.

969
01:30:35,827 --> 01:30:37,952
- Merry Christmas, Bill.
- Merry Christmas.

970
01:30:47,661 --> 01:30:49,661
Christmas
is full of surprises.

971
01:30:50,162 --> 01:30:52,162
Do you like surprises
under the tree?

972
01:30:53,578 --> 01:30:57,495
Well, we'll make sure
you have lots of surprises

973
01:30:57,995 --> 01:30:59,828
and things like that. Okay?

974
01:30:59,995 --> 01:31:02,745
I'm sure Mom and Dad
agree that
that would be a good idea.

975
01:31:02,828 --> 01:31:05,828
Surprises are the best part
of Christmas, don't you think?

976
01:31:05,912 --> 01:31:08,995
How about games?

977
01:31:10,829 --> 01:31:13,162
How about ball games?

978
01:31:16,829 --> 01:31:18,829
- Can I get you a towel?
- I'm so sorry.

979
01:31:18,913 --> 01:31:20,829
Are you all right?

980
01:31:20,913 --> 01:31:22,246
All right. It's all right.

981
01:31:22,330 --> 01:31:23,913
Can you take me
home, please?

982
01:31:23,996 --> 01:31:25,663
I think we should go home.
Lower your voice.

983
01:31:25,746 --> 01:31:28,413
You can use our bath
if you'd like.
I might have some dry clothes.

984
01:31:28,497 --> 01:31:31,580
Thank you.
Come with me, Edward.
It's all right. Come with me.

985
01:31:31,747 --> 01:31:33,747
Can I help you up,
Mrs. Wilson?

986
01:32:34,999 --> 01:32:36,916
Did you know that
Phillip is going to be

987
01:32:36,999 --> 01:32:39,582
on the Mayan Coffee Company's
board of directors?

988
01:32:42,416 --> 01:32:45,166
Remember what I said to you
about friends.

989
01:32:57,833 --> 01:32:59,333
<i>You look good, Edward.</i>

990
01:33:00,250 --> 01:33:02,1000
How long has it been?
Seven, eight years?

991
01:33:03,917 --> 01:33:06,084
A lot of water
under the bridge.

992
01:33:08,667 --> 01:33:11,501
Carolyn and I,
we just bought
our first house.

993
01:33:12,167 --> 01:33:15,501
And everything's already
broken. I spend my weekends
fixing things.

994
01:33:15,750 --> 01:33:20,167
By the time I get everything
fixed, it'll be time
to sell the fucking house.

995
01:33:21,751 --> 01:33:24,668
Maybe you can give me
a heads-up on somebody.

996
01:33:29,918 --> 01:33:33,335
You're asking me
to give you FBI files
on an American citizen?

997
01:33:33,417 --> 01:33:36,751
You know I can't do that.
It's against the law
to spy on citizens.

998
01:33:38,168 --> 01:33:39,502
Keep it.

999
01:33:39,751 --> 01:33:41,918
Maybe someday
you'll change your mind.

1000
01:34:09,836 --> 01:34:11,336
May I come in?

1001
01:34:25,503 --> 01:34:27,920
You know, I've never
been in your office.

1002
01:34:29,087 --> 01:34:30,670
How was the fishing?

1003
01:34:31,753 --> 01:34:34,587
It was a bad year.
The water is too high.

1004
01:34:36,337 --> 01:34:37,671
I understand you wanted to

1005
01:34:37,754 --> 01:34:41,170
personally give me
the Operation Zapata list
yourself.

1006
01:34:45,337 --> 01:34:47,088
There isn't one, is there?

1007
01:34:51,337 --> 01:34:53,088
You know it was
a silent operation.

1008
01:34:53,171 --> 01:34:55,171
It wasn't silent enough.

1009
01:34:59,921 --> 01:35:04,338
I've been asked by
the President to suggest
who we no longer need with us.

1010
01:35:07,922 --> 01:35:10,005
Who would you recommend,
Edward?

1011
01:35:10,088 --> 01:35:12,255
I serve at the pleasure
of the Director, sir.

1012
01:35:14,089 --> 01:35:16,005
I'm just a gatekeeper.

1013
01:35:17,422 --> 01:35:20,588
And why is it that
people like us
choose to serve,

1014
01:35:21,423 --> 01:35:24,506
for nickels a day,
in a profession that makes us

1015
01:35:25,005 --> 01:35:28,339
constantly
look over our shoulder
to see who's watching us?

1016
01:35:29,005 --> 01:35:30,839
When will you
make your decision?

1017
01:35:33,840 --> 01:35:35,089
Decision?

1018
01:35:38,756 --> 01:35:42,756
I serve at the discretion
of the President
of the United States.

1019
01:35:43,923 --> 01:35:47,090
I will do what I think
is best for the country.

1020
01:35:53,507 --> 01:35:57,173
It's important that
we find out who's responsible.

1021
01:36:00,757 --> 01:36:02,757
Good night.
Good night.

1022
01:36:15,590 --> 01:36:19,924
<i>At 2242, call received
on Berlin base chief's
operational line.</i>

1023
01:36:20,091 --> 01:36:23,924
Man says he's senior officer,
KGB. Would not give name.

1024
01:36:24,675 --> 01:36:26,341
Open up. Thanks.

1025
01:36:31,925 --> 01:36:34,925
"KGB officer asks when
Mr. Edward Wilson is coming.

1026
01:36:35,009 --> 01:36:37,842
"He wants to know
Mr. Edward Wilson's response."

1027
01:36:38,259 --> 01:36:40,425
Tell him
Mr. Edward Wilson is here,

1028
01:36:40,758 --> 01:36:44,009
and would like to know
what he intends to
provide us with in return.

1029
01:36:50,175 --> 01:36:52,592
He says,
"In return for safe journey,

1030
01:36:52,676 --> 01:36:55,592
"he will provide Mr. Wilson
with clear understanding

1031
01:36:55,676 --> 01:36:58,676

1034
01:37:07,343 --> 01:37:10,592
"He will also speak personally
with Mr. Edward Wilson about

1035
01:37:12,176 --> 01:37:13,510
"Ulysses.

1036
01:37:14,343 --> 01:37:16,760
"Things only he knows
of Ulysses,

"how he thinks,
what he plans to do,

1038
01:37:20,010 --> 01:37:24,011
"and what he wants
Mr. Edward Wilson to think
he is doing.

1039
01:37:25,094 --> 01:37:28,593
"To establish bonafides,
he will carry with him

1040
01:37:28,677 --> 01:37:33,677

1041
01:37:35,510 --> 01:37:40,261
"and would be more than happy

1042
01:37:49,428 --> 01:37:50,678
Ulysses.

1043
01:37:55,178 --> 01:37:57,428
Ask him what his weakness is.

1044
01:38:11,512 --> 01:38:12,928
"The cold."

1045
01:38:15,178 --> 01:38:16,846
Let's get him over here.

1046
01:38:17,596 --> 01:38:21,179
My name is
Valentin Gregorievich Mironov.

1047
01:38:21,762 --> 01:38:25,263
My children's names are
Anatoly and Sergei.

1048
01:38:25,263 --> 01:38:29,762
My father played the cello.
I play the violin.
But you know this.

1049
01:38:30,013 --> 01:38:34,179
I risk my life to come all
the way to tell you this, to
confirm what you already know.

1050
01:38:34,263 --> 01:38:36,096
You failed the polygraph,
Mr. Mironov.

1051
01:38:36,096 --> 01:38:38,430
You know every Russian
fails polygraph.

1052
01:38:39,680 --> 01:38:42,513
Your polygraph
doesn't understand
the Russian soul.

1053
01:38:47,180 --> 01:38:51,847
What more do you want?
I've given you my bonafides,
the names of agents,

1054
01:38:52,264 --> 01:38:55,680
<i>who has been compromised,
who you need to know about.</i>

1055
01:38:56,597 --> 01:38:59,180
<i>I want to speak to
Mr. Edward Wilson.</i>

1056
01:39:00,180 --> 01:39:02,681
We were told
Mironov was with these men
the day the photo was taken.

1057
01:39:02,764 --> 01:39:04,180
<i>Your immediate superior?</i>

1058
01:39:04,264 --> 01:39:06,180
We're not even sure that
any of the circled men
are him.

1059
01:39:06,264 --> 01:39:09,180
<i>I told you this
three times already.
Sergei Budanov.</i>

1060
01:39:09,514 --> 01:39:11,931
<i>I want to speak to
Mr. Edward Wilson.</i>

1061
01:39:16,681 --> 01:39:18,348
I would like some tea.

1062
01:39:22,182 --> 01:39:23,432
There isn't any.

1063
01:39:23,515 --> 01:39:25,681
I get thirsty
when I say too much.

1064
01:39:25,931 --> 01:39:28,848
You going to keep up
this inane questioning
for much longer?

1065
01:39:30,182 --> 01:39:33,599
There's nothing you've told us
we don't know, Mr. Mironov.

1066
01:39:34,849 --> 01:39:36,932
I think you better try
a little harder.

1067
01:39:37,016 --> 01:39:40,765
I didn't come here
to deal with children,
Mr. Edison.

1068
01:39:41,348 --> 01:39:43,016
Or is it Mr. Brocco?

1069
01:39:45,515 --> 01:39:47,433
We do our homework, too.

1070
01:39:57,516 --> 01:40:00,099
Hello, Mr. Mironov.
I'm Mr. Wilson.

1071
01:40:05,600 --> 01:40:07,100
Hello, Mother.

1072
01:40:10,100 --> 01:40:15,100
Ulysses is obsessed with you.
Night and day,
you are always on his mind.

1073
01:40:16,184 --> 01:40:17,766
He trusts nobody.

1074
01:40:17,933 --> 01:40:21,684
The only one
whom he lets close
is his aide, Sasha.

1075
01:40:22,517 --> 01:40:25,851
He is methodical,
he plans things
years in advance.

1076
01:40:26,767 --> 01:40:29,601
For instance, you should know
he has developed a friendship

1077
01:40:29,684 --> 01:40:31,767
with a certain
neighbor of yours.

1078
01:40:32,101 --> 01:40:36,101
Fidel Castro. A young man
he has high hopes for.

1079
01:40:36,684 --> 01:40:40,435
I understand you had
a most interesting
fish swim your way.

1080
01:40:40,851 --> 01:40:44,435
Mr. Allen thought
it might be possible
for me to speak with him.

1081
01:40:44,518 --> 01:40:46,851
With you as the chaperone,
of course.

1082
01:40:46,934 --> 01:40:49,185
I brought him a little gift
I'm sure he'll appreciate.

1083
01:40:49,268 --> 01:40:51,435
Send Mironov in immediately.

1084
01:40:52,185 --> 01:40:54,518
It'll be nice
to be closely working
with you again.

1085
01:40:54,852 --> 01:40:59,102
I expect you to show me
Washington. We can
paint the town red together.

1086
01:41:01,102 --> 01:41:03,518
Valentin Mironov,
Arch Cummings.

1087
01:41:03,685 --> 01:41:06,602
It is a great pleasure
to meet you.
My pleasure.

1088
01:41:06,685 --> 01:41:07,685
Now, please sit down.

1089
01:41:07,769 --> 01:41:11,102
It's nice to have someone
like you on our side
of the street.

1090
01:41:12,519 --> 01:41:14,436
I thought you may enjoy this.

1091
01:41:14,686 --> 01:41:17,519
It's something
you might appreciate.
I hope you haven't read it.

1092
01:41:19,269 --> 01:41:20,686
Very clever.

1093
01:41:22,186 --> 01:41:23,603
Thank you.

1094
01:41:26,853 --> 01:41:28,936
All Russia is our orchard.

1095
01:41:29,352 --> 01:41:31,770
The land is great
and beautiful.

1096
01:41:32,103 --> 01:41:34,853
There are many
wonderful places in it.

1097
01:41:34,936 --> 01:41:36,603
Think, Anya.

1098
01:41:36,770 --> 01:41:39,187
Your grandfather,
your great-grandfather...

1099
01:41:39,270 --> 01:41:43,520
This is a very bad
translation. It is
much funnier in Russian.

1100
01:41:46,353 --> 01:41:48,021
And now,
doesn't something human
look at you

1101
01:41:48,103 --> 01:41:50,270
from every cherry
in the orchard?

1102
01:41:50,687 --> 01:41:52,937
From every leaf
and every stalk?

1103
01:41:53,854 --> 01:41:56,188
Don't you hear their voices?

1104
01:41:57,188 --> 01:42:00,604
It's awful.
Your orchard is terrible!

1105
01:42:00,937 --> 01:42:03,687
And when in the evening
or at night, when you walk
through the orchard

1106
01:42:03,771 --> 01:42:06,104
and the old bark glows
with the dim light

1107
01:42:06,188 --> 01:42:09,188
and the old cherry trees seem
to be dreaming of all that was

1108
01:42:09,271 --> 01:42:12,104
a hundred, two hundred
years ago, and are repressed
by their heavy visions.

1109
01:42:12,104 --> 01:42:13,772
I'm due at a meeting.

1110
01:42:14,104 --> 01:42:17,521
We've left those 200 years
behind us, but so far,
we gained nothing at all.

1111
01:42:17,772 --> 01:42:20,355
We don't yet know
what the past is to be to us.

1112
01:42:21,022 --> 01:42:26,272
We only philosophize.
We complain that we are dull,
or we drink vodka.

1113
01:42:27,105 --> 01:42:30,189
For it's so clear
that in order to
begin to live in the present,

1114
01:42:30,272 --> 01:42:32,105
we must first redeem the past.

1115
01:42:37,689 --> 01:42:39,189
Are you Laura?

1116
01:42:39,939 --> 01:42:41,105
What?

1117
01:42:41,189 --> 01:42:44,356
Are you Laura? I'm supposed to
offer you a ride.

1118
01:43:08,024 --> 01:43:09,607
Hello, Edward.

1119
01:43:10,857 --> 01:43:12,107
Hello, Laura.

1120
01:43:13,857 --> 01:43:15,690
Why all the mystery?

1121
01:43:19,107 --> 01:43:20,941
Do you have children?

1122
01:43:21,107 --> 01:43:22,774
I have a boy.

1123
01:43:23,774 --> 01:43:25,608
Edward Junior.

1124
01:43:30,274 --> 01:43:31,942
Do you have anybody?

1125
01:43:35,775 --> 01:43:37,191
A cat.

1126
01:43:42,108 --> 01:43:45,775
I've often imagined
what my life would have
been like with you.

1127
01:43:47,359 --> 01:43:49,359
And what did you imagine?

1128
01:43:50,609 --> 01:43:52,692
I thought you might teach.

1129
01:43:53,275 --> 01:43:54,942
Probably poetry.

1130
01:43:56,859 --> 01:43:59,609
I saw us living
in a small college town.

1131
01:44:14,859 --> 01:44:19,610
You once said to me you were
afraid your life was
already planned out for you.

1132
01:44:23,777 --> 01:44:25,944
Are you doing
what you want to do?

1133
01:44:28,610 --> 01:44:30,860
My life has been
full of surprises.

1134
01:44:57,111 --> 01:44:59,195
You owe me
a day at the beach.

1135
01:45:43,196 --> 01:45:45,029
How long do you think
you'll be?

1136
01:45:45,613 --> 01:45:47,446
As long as it takes.

1137
01:45:52,030 --> 01:45:54,780
I think maybe
I'll go ahead.
All right.

1138
01:45:59,030 --> 01:46:02,197
<i>Nothing else
is built the same</i>

1139
01:46:02,364 --> 01:46:05,947
<i>Nothing in the world</i>

1140
01:46:06,030 --> 01:46:08,947
<i>As the soft
and wavy frame...</i>

1141
01:46:10,280 --> 01:46:11,531
Mother?

1142
01:46:13,948 --> 01:46:16,197
There was an envelope for you
on the desk.

1143
01:46:18,115 --> 01:46:19,447
You look lovely.

1144
01:46:19,614 --> 01:46:21,447
Thank you, darling.

1145
01:47:09,449 --> 01:47:11,699
It's not enough
that you ignore me
our whole life?

1146
01:47:11,783 --> 01:47:13,366
You have to humiliate me?
Margaret, please.

1147
01:47:13,449 --> 01:47:15,117
You disgust me!
Calm down, darling.

1148
01:47:15,533 --> 01:47:16,699
You're disgusting!

1149
01:47:42,534 --> 01:47:44,034
We'll start from the last.

1150
01:47:46,867 --> 01:47:48,784
<i>So suppose
the dame ain't right</i>

1151
01:47:48,867 --> 01:47:50,618
<i>Or completely
free from flaws</i>

1152
01:48:16,952 --> 01:48:18,952
Mother forgot
some of her things.

1153
01:48:31,452 --> 01:48:33,120
I'll see you at home.

1154
01:49:32,705 --> 01:49:34,205
Are you Laura?

1155
01:49:35,289 --> 01:49:36,539
Yes.

1156
01:49:36,622 --> 01:49:38,789
I was asked to give you this.

1157
01:49:52,039 --> 01:49:55,123
<i>In an
unprecedented effort to
improve U.S.-Soviet ties,</i>

1158
01:49:55,123 --> 01:49:58,540
<i>Premier Khrushchev
began his 10-day tour
of the United States today.</i>

1159
01:49:58,622 --> 01:50:01,290
<i>The visit
will start with a tour
by President Eisenhower</i>

1160
01:50:01,373 --> 01:50:02,623
<i>of our nation's capital,</i>

1161
01:50:02,706 --> 01:50:05,540
<i>followed by
a highly anticipated speech
at the United Nations.</i>

1162
01:50:05,623 --> 01:50:07,290
All right,
now set it down.

1163
01:50:07,373 --> 01:50:10,623
<i>Following that,
the Soviet Premier
will travel across the country</i>

1164
01:50:10,707 --> 01:50:12,040
<i>to more casual destinations,</i>

1165
01:50:12,123 --> 01:50:16,124
<i>including America's mighty
steel mills, wheat farms,
and, yes, Disneyland.</i>

1166
01:50:16,957 --> 01:50:19,790
<i>President Eisenhower greeted
Mr. Khrushchev this morning</i>

1167
01:50:19,874 --> 01:50:22,124
<i>at Andrews Air Force Base,
as they prepare to discuss...</i>

1168
01:50:22,207 --> 01:50:23,457
It's perfect.

1169
01:50:23,457 --> 01:50:25,957
<i>...the ever-threatening
military build-up by the Reds.</i>

1170
01:50:26,040 --> 01:50:28,957
Our glee club's
been chosen to compete
in a national competition.

1171
01:50:29,040 --> 01:50:30,957
<i>Now, back to
The Classical Hour.</i>

1172
01:50:31,040 --> 01:50:32,874
Would you come with me?

1173
01:50:33,708 --> 01:50:35,374
Would you like me to?

1174
01:50:36,040 --> 01:50:37,624
Yeah, very much.

1175
01:51:12,209 --> 01:51:13,625
I'll get your things.

1176
01:51:16,709 --> 01:51:18,376
It's good
to have you home.

1177
01:51:44,710 --> 01:51:46,377
How was your trip?

1178
01:51:46,877 --> 01:51:48,877
Smooth as silk.

1179
01:51:49,043 --> 01:51:53,294
My FBI escort
made the trip here
very pleasant.

1180
01:52:06,794 --> 01:52:08,627
Which one is your son?

1181
01:52:09,961 --> 01:52:12,211
Top row, third from the right.

1182
01:52:13,961 --> 01:52:16,961
He's a handsome young man.
My congratulations.

1183
01:52:18,878 --> 01:52:21,628
We're particularly concerned
about Cuba.

1184
01:52:23,128 --> 01:52:24,795
Your friend,

1185
01:52:25,962 --> 01:52:27,462
he's too close to home.

1186
01:52:27,628 --> 01:52:30,628
You don't appreciate
him breathing down your neck.

1187
01:52:32,462 --> 01:52:34,545
If we continue down this road,

1188
01:52:35,129 --> 01:52:37,463
there will be
a Third World War.

1189
01:52:37,712 --> 01:52:40,379
I don't think
either of us wants a real war.

1190
01:52:40,463 --> 01:52:42,879
What would we do
for a living then?

1191
01:52:45,962 --> 01:52:48,296
If he keeps
calling attention to himself,

1192
01:52:48,463 --> 01:52:52,546
at some point, we may be
forced to send him a surprise.

1193
01:52:53,379 --> 01:52:56,296
Now, I don't want that
to come as a surprise
to your people.

1194
01:52:56,379 --> 01:52:58,546
He is very important to us.

1195
01:52:59,713 --> 01:53:02,464
We would not like
to be surprised.

1196
01:53:08,130 --> 01:53:09,380
Be well.

1197
01:53:12,464 --> 01:53:13,797
Be well.

1198
01:53:30,214 --> 01:53:35,298
<i>I am today announcing my
candidacy for the Presidency
of the United States.</i>

1199
01:53:36,298 --> 01:53:40,048
<i>The Presidency
is the most powerful office
in the free world.</i>

1200
01:53:40,131 --> 01:53:44,381
<i>Through its leadership
can come a more vital life
for all of our people.</i>

1201
01:53:45,049 --> 01:53:49,049
<i>In it are centered the hopes
of the globe around us,
for freedom</i>

1202
01:53:49,298 --> 01:53:51,215
<i>and a more secure life.</i>

1203
01:53:51,465 --> 01:53:54,215
<i>Senator Kennedy,
if you don't win
the Presidential nomination,</i>

1204
01:53:54,299 --> 01:53:56,299
<i>will you accept
the Vice Presidency?</i>

1205
01:53:56,299 --> 01:53:59,466
<i>I shall not, under
any conditions, be a candidate
for Vice President.</i>

1206
01:53:59,549 --> 01:54:05,215
<i>If I fail in this endeavor,
I shall return and serve
in the United States Senate.</i>

1207
01:54:06,132 --> 01:54:08,466
We have a secure circuit
with Stockholm station.

1208
01:54:08,466 --> 01:54:11,466
Station reports they have
a colonel, Directorate K,
counterintelligence.

1209
01:54:11,466 --> 01:54:12,799
Do we have a name?

1210
01:54:13,382 --> 01:54:14,716
<i>May I help you, sir?</i>

1211
01:54:14,799 --> 01:54:17,966
<i>I'm a colonel with KGB.
I'm requesting asylum.</i>

1212
01:54:18,050 --> 01:54:19,383
<i>What is your name?</i>

1213
01:54:20,216 --> 01:54:23,050
<i>My name is
Valentin Gregorievich Mironov.</i>

1214
01:54:31,634 --> 01:54:34,800
<i>My name is
Valentin Gregorievich Mironov.</i>

1215
01:54:35,383 --> 01:54:37,967
This other man who says
he is Valentin Mironov

1216
01:54:37,967 --> 01:54:39,884
is not who he pretends to be.

1217
01:54:39,967 --> 01:54:41,383
All right?
His real name is Yuri Modin.

1218
01:54:43,134 --> 01:54:45,800
<i>He was
Ulysses' right hand.
He is Ulysses' mole.</i>

1219
01:54:45,884 --> 01:54:48,217
<i>Just tell me your real name.</i>

1220
01:54:48,634 --> 01:54:51,217
It is just Ulysses
trying to discredit me.

1221
01:54:52,301 --> 01:54:53,884
<i>Just tell me your real name.</i>

1222
01:54:54,051 --> 01:54:58,551
My real name is
Valentin Gregorievich Mironov.

1223
01:55:00,384 --> 01:55:03,051
I was born
in Bobruisk in 1924.

1224
01:55:03,217 --> 01:55:05,635
Attended the State Institute
of International Relations.

1225
01:55:05,635 --> 01:55:07,885
Served for three years
in Naval Intelligence.

1226
01:55:07,968 --> 01:55:10,384
My wife's name is
Tamara Markovskaya.

1227
01:55:10,551 --> 01:55:13,468
My children's names are
Anatoly and Sergei.

1228
01:55:14,468 --> 01:55:17,968
<i>My father is a cellist.
I play the violin.</i>

1229
01:55:19,718 --> 01:55:21,552
All I want is my freedom.

1230
01:55:27,552 --> 01:55:28,886
<i>Pick him up.</i>

1231
01:55:30,469 --> 01:55:31,969
You all right?

1232
01:55:32,469 --> 01:55:35,136
I'm sorry.
You see what you made me do?

1233
01:55:35,552 --> 01:55:37,969
Now just tell me the truth.

1234
01:55:41,470 --> 01:55:44,969
Because we're going to be here
as long as it takes.

1235
01:55:45,303 --> 01:55:47,553
I already told you
the truth.
I want to know the truth.

1236
01:55:47,637 --> 01:55:49,637
You know my name.
Tell me your real name.

1237
01:55:49,720 --> 01:55:51,803
Mister, please,
I'm not lying.

1238
01:55:51,886 --> 01:55:54,553
I'd like to believe you,
but I don't believe you.
Understand?

1239
01:55:54,637 --> 01:55:55,970
Now, tell me your name.

1240
01:55:56,053 --> 01:55:59,803
My name is Mironov. It's
Valentin Gregorievich Mironov.

1241
01:55:59,887 --> 01:56:01,137
That's your name?
Yeah.

1242
01:56:01,221 --> 01:56:03,221
That's your real name.
Yes. This is my name.

1243
01:56:03,304 --> 01:56:05,137
Tell me your name.
I told you my name.

1244
01:56:05,137 --> 01:56:07,137
I told you a hundred times.

1245
01:56:07,137 --> 01:56:09,304
We're not going anywhere.
I just want you to know that.

1246
01:56:09,304 --> 01:56:12,304
We are not going anywhere.
Today, tomorrow,
next week, next month.

1247
01:56:12,387 --> 01:56:14,803
Yuri Modin. He is your mole.
I am not your mole.

1248
01:56:14,887 --> 01:56:16,137
You understand?
I cannot tell you
anything else.

1249
01:56:16,221 --> 01:56:17,970
I'm gonna be
right in front of you.
The same position.

1250
01:56:17,970 --> 01:56:19,638
This is my name.
What is your name?

1251
01:56:19,638 --> 01:56:21,804
My name is
Valentin Gregorievich Mironov.
This is my name.

1252
01:56:21,804 --> 01:56:23,471
Tell me your name.

1253
01:56:23,971 --> 01:56:25,304
I don't have
a different name.

1254
01:56:25,304 --> 01:56:26,638
Tell it.
I don't have it.

1255
01:56:26,804 --> 01:56:28,387
Tell it to me again.
This is my name.

1256
01:56:28,471 --> 01:56:29,804
Valentin Gregorievich Mironov.
Tell it to me again.

1257
01:56:29,888 --> 01:56:33,222
Valentin Gregorievich...
Tell me your fucking name!

1258
01:56:33,305 --> 01:56:34,721
Mironov!

1259
01:56:34,804 --> 01:56:37,305
Valentin Gregorievich
Mironov!
We are gonna be here
a long time.

1260
01:56:37,305 --> 01:56:39,555
<i>This is my name!</i>

1261
01:56:39,639 --> 01:56:41,555
<i>It's Valentin Mironov!</i>

1262
01:56:41,639 --> 01:56:44,055
Shut up! Shut up!
I told you!
I don't have a different...

1263
01:56:44,138 --> 01:56:47,555
Tell me your name!

1264
01:56:47,639 --> 01:56:51,388
Tell me your fucking name!

1265
01:56:52,222 --> 01:56:54,555
<i>Tell me your name!
Tell me your name!</i>

1266
01:56:56,805 --> 01:56:58,889
<i>Come on, tear it off.
Get it off!</i>

1267
01:57:02,056 --> 01:57:03,389
Put him down.

1268
01:57:11,306 --> 01:57:12,807
<i>Your name.</i>

1269
01:57:13,139 --> 01:57:14,473
<i>What is your name?</i>

1270
01:57:18,890 --> 01:57:20,723
Tell me your name.

1271
01:57:33,973 --> 01:57:36,474
What is your name?

1272
01:57:37,307 --> 01:57:40,224
Sir, this is
lysergic acid diethylamide.

1273
01:57:40,974 --> 01:57:42,557
It's called LSD.

1274
01:57:44,557 --> 01:57:47,808
We've had
some very favorable results
as a truth serum.

1275
01:58:28,643 --> 01:58:30,476
Look, it's him. Papa.

1276
01:59:08,727 --> 01:59:10,644
Soviet power is a myth.

1277
01:59:14,727 --> 01:59:16,228
A great show,

1278
01:59:16,395 --> 01:59:19,395
but there are no spare parts.
Nothing is working.

1279
01:59:19,478 --> 01:59:22,561
It's nothing but painted rust.

1280
01:59:27,311 --> 01:59:28,561
But you.

1281
01:59:31,228 --> 01:59:33,478
<i>You need to keep
the Russian myth alive</i>

1282
01:59:33,561 --> 01:59:36,812
<i>to maintain your
military-industrial complex.</i>

1283
01:59:37,395 --> 01:59:41,396
<i>Your system depends on Russia
being perceived
as a mortal threat.</i>

1284
01:59:43,728 --> 01:59:45,396
It's not a threat.

1285
01:59:47,062 --> 01:59:51,229
It was never a threat.
It will never be a threat.

1286
01:59:53,813 --> 01:59:55,145
It is

1287
01:59:55,980 --> 01:59:57,312
a rotted,

1288
01:59:57,980 --> 01:59:59,479
bloated

1289
02:00:00,479 --> 02:00:01,813
cow.

1290
02:00:13,647 --> 02:00:14,980
<i>I am</i>

1291
02:00:15,313 --> 02:00:17,980
<i>Valentin Gregorievich Mironov</i>

1292
02:00:19,480 --> 02:00:22,230
<i>and I am free.</i>

1293
02:00:28,147 --> 02:00:30,647
<i>Shit. Shit!</i>

1294
02:00:44,898 --> 02:00:46,564
If you would like,

1295
02:00:47,648 --> 02:00:50,564
I'll be willing to take
the truth serum, Edward.

1296
02:00:53,148 --> 02:00:55,148
I've nothing to hide.

1297
02:00:56,731 --> 02:00:58,731
I am who I say I am.

1298
02:01:05,982 --> 02:01:07,315
I know.

1299
02:01:24,233 --> 02:01:27,483
<i>We send
those who are leaving us
to go into the world</i>

1300
02:01:27,483 --> 02:01:30,316
with the knowledge,
wherever they go,

1301
02:01:30,816 --> 02:01:33,816
whatever they do,
they will never be alone.

1302
02:01:34,483 --> 02:01:36,733
They will always be one of us.

1303
02:01:37,483 --> 02:01:39,733
And we say,
Bonesmen, all here.

1304
02:01:39,817 --> 02:01:41,316
All here.
All here.

1305
02:01:52,067 --> 02:01:54,067
I didn't know you smoked.

1306
02:01:55,234 --> 02:01:57,568
There are a few things
you don't know about me.

1307
02:02:05,901 --> 02:02:08,317
I've spoken
to a recruiter here.

1308
02:02:09,150 --> 02:02:11,985
I would like very much
to join CIA.

1309
02:02:12,985 --> 02:02:15,901
There are a lot of things
you can do, Edward.

1310
02:02:16,734 --> 02:02:18,651
I'd like you to think
about this very carefully.

1311
02:02:18,734 --> 02:02:20,985
I have thought about it
carefully. It's what
I want to do.

1312
02:02:20,985 --> 02:02:22,402
I want to join the Agency.

1313
02:02:25,235 --> 02:02:26,735
I want to
make you proud of me.

1314
02:02:26,818 --> 02:02:28,402
I am proud of you.

1315
02:02:28,485 --> 02:02:30,735
I've made up my mind, Father.

1316
02:02:32,986 --> 02:02:34,652
<i>You can stop him.</i>

1317
02:02:35,652 --> 02:02:38,069
He doesn't understand
what he's getting into.
You can stop him.

1318
02:02:38,153 --> 02:02:39,819
I can't tell him what to do.
Yes, you can.

1319
02:02:39,819 --> 02:02:41,569
No, I can't.
Yes, you can.

1320
02:02:41,652 --> 02:02:43,819
Because he's doing it for you.

1321
02:02:43,902 --> 02:02:47,069
Because he wants you to
be proud of him. And he wants
to feel closer to you.

1322
02:02:47,153 --> 02:02:48,153
You could
have them reject him.

1323
02:02:48,153 --> 02:02:49,652
Absolutely not.
I won't do that to him.

1324
02:02:49,735 --> 02:02:52,653
Of course you won't.
You wouldn't do anything
for anybody but yourself.

1325
02:02:52,986 --> 02:02:54,820
That is unfair.
Unfair?

1326
02:02:54,820 --> 02:02:55,902
That is unfair.

1327
02:02:55,986 --> 02:02:57,486
You abandon the people
when they need you the most.

1328
02:02:57,570 --> 02:02:58,653
I don't abandon people!

1329
02:02:58,736 --> 02:03:00,153
You abandon people!
I do not abandon people.

1330
02:03:00,319 --> 02:03:01,319
It's true.

1331
02:03:01,319 --> 02:03:03,319
I have stood by you
for 22 years!
Stood by me?

1332
02:03:03,319 --> 02:03:04,319
I have stood by you.

1333
02:03:04,403 --> 02:03:05,987
You don't know what it is
to stand by somebody.

1334
02:03:06,070 --> 02:03:07,736
I stood by you
and I have stood by him,

1335
02:03:07,820 --> 02:03:09,903
I have done everything
to be a good father to him.

1336
02:03:09,987 --> 02:03:13,154
You have done no such thing!
I married you because of him!

1337
02:03:38,654 --> 02:03:42,238
I know you don't love me,
but you love him.

1338
02:03:43,155 --> 02:03:46,405
And no matter what,
you should stand by him
and you should protect him.

1339
02:03:46,488 --> 02:03:48,738
I don't need you to tell me
I have to protect my son.

1340
02:03:48,822 --> 02:03:50,822
Promise me that
you'll protect him.

1341
02:03:54,655 --> 02:03:56,321
I'll protect him.

1342
02:04:01,156 --> 02:04:03,072
<i>Today, in Havana,
Fidel Castro</i>

1343
02:04:03,156 --> 02:04:05,739
<i>expelled high-profile
crime figures from Cuba.</i>

1344
02:04:05,822 --> 02:04:07,989
<i>He's taken control
of their hotels and casinos,</i>

1345
02:04:08,072 --> 02:04:10,822
<i>popular vacation destinations
for many Americans.</i>

1346
02:04:10,989 --> 02:04:12,989
<i>Castro has nationalized
over $1 billion</i>

1347
02:04:13,072 --> 02:04:14,823
<i>from U.S. businesses
in the past six months,</i>

1348
02:04:14,905 --> 02:04:17,072
<i>and there's no telling
what the Communist dictator
might do next.</i>

1349
02:04:17,156 --> 02:04:18,573
I want to see a man
about a hat.

1350
02:04:19,322 --> 02:04:22,656
<i>He had
three casinos down there
until Castro sent him home.</i>

1351
02:04:23,489 --> 02:04:25,573
<i>His people know
how to be discreet.</i>

1352
02:04:26,489 --> 02:04:30,740
<i>With the right encouragement,
he could help.
And he's very patriotic.</i>

1353
02:04:31,157 --> 02:04:33,407
Jimmy. Mr. Carlson.

1354
02:04:35,240 --> 02:04:36,740
Tina, the kids.

1355
02:04:36,823 --> 02:04:40,323
Come on, kids. Come on,
come on. We're going
to the beach. Let's go.

1356
02:04:40,574 --> 02:04:41,990
Mom, please.

1357
02:04:43,824 --> 02:04:46,741
Sit down. Want some water,
some coffee, whatever?

1358
02:04:48,240 --> 02:04:49,824
Is there someplace else
we could go?

1359
02:04:52,907 --> 02:04:55,907
All right, Daddy, we're going
down to the beach.
We'll be back in a while.

1360
02:04:55,991 --> 02:04:59,074
Make sure they don't go
into the water unless
somebody's watching them.

1361
02:04:59,158 --> 02:05:00,824
No, I'm gonna
let them drown.

1362
02:05:00,907 --> 02:05:03,741
Make sure they put
their shoes on.
They'll burn their feet!

1363
02:05:03,824 --> 02:05:07,158
We're getting their shoes!
All right, come on. Let's go.

1364
02:05:11,158 --> 02:05:12,992
So, what do you want to
talk to me about?

1365
02:05:13,074 --> 02:05:16,491
The government's
about to deport you
for certain activities.

1366
02:05:16,575 --> 02:05:19,159
I've been in this country
since I'm two months old.

1367
02:05:19,658 --> 02:05:22,658
What does that make me,
Italian? I'm American.

1368
02:05:23,825 --> 02:05:25,575
And they're trying to
send me back?

1369
02:05:25,658 --> 02:05:27,908
I could have the
deportation order reviewed.

1370
02:05:29,492 --> 02:05:32,492
Have you classified as
highly sensitive
for national security.

1371
02:05:32,576 --> 02:05:35,576
I could take the government
off your back
if you can help us.

1372
02:05:36,326 --> 02:05:39,159
Youse are the guys
that scare me.

1373
02:05:39,159 --> 02:05:40,826
You're the people
that make big wars.

1374
02:05:41,492 --> 02:05:44,826
No, we make sure the wars
are small ones, Mr. Palmi.

1375
02:05:45,993 --> 02:05:47,659
Let me ask you something.

1376
02:05:48,576 --> 02:05:52,076
We Italians,
we got our families
and we got the Church.

1377
02:05:53,327 --> 02:05:57,410
The Irish,
they have their homeland.
The Jews, their tradition.

1378
02:05:59,160 --> 02:06:01,827
Even the niggers,
they got their music.

1379
02:06:03,243 --> 02:06:06,660
What about you people,
Mr. Carlson? What do you have?

1380
02:06:08,493 --> 02:06:12,493
The United States of America.
The rest of you
are just visiting.

1381
02:06:19,994 --> 02:06:22,827
<i>The President wants
the noise level
on the operation turned down.</i>

1382
02:06:26,578 --> 02:06:28,161
How many men are involved?

1383
02:06:29,745 --> 02:06:31,411
Fifteen hundred.

1384
02:06:33,494 --> 02:06:36,078
<i>Tell him we're going instead
to Bahía de Cochinos.</i>

1385
02:06:36,162 --> 02:06:38,162
The noise level
will be way down.

1386
02:06:47,579 --> 02:06:49,245
We'll see you inside.

1387
02:07:09,163 --> 02:07:11,330
Could you hear
what we were talking about?

1388
02:07:11,330 --> 02:07:13,496
No, I didn't hear anything.

1389
02:07:15,580 --> 02:07:19,246
If something was heard,
it has to stay in this room.

1390
02:07:20,246 --> 02:07:22,246
Oh, I know that, Father.

1391
02:07:25,413 --> 02:07:26,747
Yeah, all right.

1392
02:07:44,164 --> 02:07:45,497
Bonesmen!

1393
02:07:46,497 --> 02:07:47,831
All here!

1394
02:07:50,915 --> 02:07:53,664
Reverend Christiansen
will offer grace.

1395
02:07:55,081 --> 02:07:57,581
Agency first, God second.

1396
02:07:57,664 --> 02:07:59,998
Thank you, Lord,
for bringing us safely here

1397
02:08:00,081 --> 02:08:02,664
to be with our brothers
and loved ones again.

1398
02:08:03,497 --> 02:08:07,332
Our prayers are
with our brothers
whom God has seen fit

1399
02:08:07,415 --> 02:08:09,998
to take into
his gentle arms this year.

1400
02:08:10,081 --> 02:08:15,499
The Honorable Senator
John Russell, Senior.
Mr. Stephen Loomis...

1401
02:08:48,416 --> 02:08:50,167
Would you like to dance,
Clover?

1402
02:08:52,833 --> 02:08:55,500
I haven't been Clover
for a long time.

1403
02:09:29,418 --> 02:09:31,752
I'm going to Phoenix
to live with my mother.

1404
02:09:41,585 --> 02:09:43,335
<i>Based on the ringing
of the church bells,</i>

1405
02:09:43,335 --> 02:09:45,086
<i>we're going to assume
the recording was made</i>

1406
02:09:45,169 --> 02:09:47,086
<i>at the same time
the photograph was taken.</i>

1407
02:09:47,336 --> 02:09:49,752
We've checked the schedules
for flights
leaving major airports

1408
02:09:49,835 --> 02:09:53,086
at or around 10:00 at night
for a two-week period.

1409
02:09:53,336 --> 02:09:56,002
There were flights
leaving nine cities.

1410
02:09:56,002 --> 02:10:00,336
Six were places
that also would potentially
have a fan made in Belgium.

1411
02:10:00,336 --> 02:10:04,669
Five of those places
were also either tropical
or in their summer seasons.

1412
02:10:04,669 --> 02:10:07,920
Three of those were places
where French is spoken.

1413
02:10:08,503 --> 02:10:11,836
We think the tape was made
in either Dakar, Abidjan,

1414
02:10:12,003 --> 02:10:14,003
or Congo-Leo.

1415
02:13:08,343 --> 02:13:09,843
It is all gone.

1416
02:13:15,677 --> 02:13:17,177
Hello, Mother.

1417
02:13:19,010 --> 02:13:20,177
Let me show you.

1418
02:13:27,010 --> 02:13:30,094
As you see, no cameras,
no tape recorders.

1419
02:13:33,261 --> 02:13:35,511
There is nothing else to know.

1420
02:13:39,344 --> 02:13:41,261
Can I play something for you?

1421
02:13:47,095 --> 02:13:49,011
<i>Everything is a secret.</i>

1422
02:13:51,595 --> 02:13:53,679
<i>You were brought up
on secrets.</i>

1423
02:13:53,679 --> 02:13:57,095
<i>What was such a big secret
that his own son
couldn't know?</i>

1424
02:13:59,428 --> 02:14:01,846
<i>When he was
standing outside talking,</i>

1425
02:14:03,095 --> 02:14:04,846
<i>I'd heard something
I wasn't supposed to,</i>

1426
02:14:04,846 --> 02:14:07,846
<i>and he knew I'd listened
to his conversation.</i>

1427
02:14:09,012 --> 02:14:11,346
<i>I heard them
say something in Spanish.</i>

1428
02:14:13,012 --> 02:14:14,346
Bahía de Cochinos.

1429
02:14:15,179 --> 02:14:17,096
Bahía de Cochinos.

1430
02:14:18,429 --> 02:14:20,096
<i>I'm afraid of him.</i>

1431
02:14:22,179 --> 02:14:24,179
<i>You are safe
here with me.</i>

1432
02:14:25,680 --> 02:14:28,763
<i>People who
really love each other
don't have secrets.</i>

1433
02:14:30,763 --> 02:14:32,513
<i>I have something to tell you.</i>

1434
02:14:41,847 --> 02:14:43,847
<i>I love you so much.</i>

1435
02:14:45,013 --> 02:14:46,763
<i>I love you so much.</i>

1436
02:14:54,013 --> 02:14:57,514
She's been an active asset
of ours for some time.

1437
02:15:01,181 --> 02:15:02,514
Until now.

1438
02:15:04,348 --> 02:15:05,764
She loves your son.

1439
02:15:10,681 --> 02:15:13,348
Sometimes
even spies fall in love.

1440
02:15:17,181 --> 02:15:18,931
We can protect him.

1441
02:15:19,432 --> 02:15:20,932
Make him safe.

1442
02:15:21,348 --> 02:15:23,682
Nobody would know,
not even him.

1443
02:15:27,265 --> 02:15:29,849
All it would require
is for you

1444
02:15:31,932 --> 02:15:33,266
to help us

1445
02:15:34,598 --> 02:15:36,598
when your help is needed.

1446
02:15:51,433 --> 02:15:53,266
I thought
you'd like to see this.

1447
02:15:57,766 --> 02:15:59,850
She's a very pretty girl.

1448
02:16:00,933 --> 02:16:03,600
It's easy to see
why he fell for her.

1449
02:16:19,600 --> 02:16:23,017
I know it's an extremely
difficult situation for you.

1450
02:16:27,351 --> 02:16:30,435
But I'm afraid I'm going to
need your answer very soon.

1451
02:16:33,351 --> 02:16:34,851
You must decide

1452
02:16:36,601 --> 02:16:39,101
what is of more importance
to you.

1453
02:16:40,852 --> 02:16:42,518
Your country or...

1454
02:16:47,019 --> 02:16:48,518
Or your son.

1455
02:17:18,769 --> 02:17:20,602
She's not
who you think she is.

1456
02:17:22,853 --> 02:17:25,020
She's not a friendly, Edward.

1457
02:17:25,687 --> 02:17:27,520
I don't believe you.

1458
02:17:27,936 --> 02:17:30,186
Why should I believe you?

1459
02:17:30,520 --> 02:17:33,437
You told me yourself
not to trust anybody.

1460
02:17:34,437 --> 02:17:37,186
You're the master
at creating the truth.

1461
02:17:39,021 --> 02:17:40,437
I love her.

1462
02:17:41,187 --> 02:17:42,854
I've asked her
to marry me.

1463
02:17:43,354 --> 02:17:45,187
I will not let you
take that away from me.

1464
02:17:45,354 --> 02:17:47,604
I can't protect you anymore,
I can't keep you safe.

1465
02:17:47,687 --> 02:17:48,770
Safe?

1466
02:17:51,271 --> 02:17:53,438
Safe? I never felt safe.

1467
02:17:53,688 --> 02:17:54,937
I was always frightened.

1468
02:17:55,021 --> 02:17:58,021
I always lived in fear
that something awful
was going to happen to you.

1469
02:17:58,104 --> 02:18:00,021
Or if not,
to Mother or to me.

1470
02:18:00,021 --> 02:18:03,187
I was always afraid, because
everything was a secret.

1471
02:19:22,357 --> 02:19:23,357
Edward.

1472
02:19:23,441 --> 02:19:25,774
Hello, may I come in?
Yes. Of course.

1473
02:19:25,858 --> 02:19:27,774
Is everything all right?

1474
02:19:28,858 --> 02:19:30,524
I was on my way home
from work

1475
02:19:30,608 --> 02:19:33,858
and I had this
overwhelming desire
to hear you play the violin.

1476
02:19:33,858 --> 02:19:35,525
Play the violin? But...

1477
02:19:36,691 --> 02:19:39,609
Edward, I'm so tired.
Can't this wait
until tomorrow?

1478
02:19:39,858 --> 02:19:42,192
I'd appreciate it
if you'd play it now.

1479
02:19:43,442 --> 02:19:44,525
Now?

1480
02:22:58,699 --> 02:23:01,367
I just wanted to
hear something from you
that was true.

1481
02:23:11,617 --> 02:23:13,283
<i>He was careless.</i>

1482
02:23:13,700 --> 02:23:16,283
FBI. You're under arrest.
Stand up.

1483
02:23:18,200 --> 02:23:20,200
Didn't learn how to
hide in plain sight.

1484
02:23:20,533 --> 02:23:22,367
Where are they taking me?

1485
02:23:22,450 --> 02:23:25,367
I can't go home! You know
they can't trust me anymore!

1486
02:23:25,867 --> 02:23:27,700
You know
what they will do to me!

1487
02:23:28,034 --> 02:23:29,368
Sorry, Edward.

1488
02:23:30,867 --> 02:23:33,242
<i>I truly did like you.</i>

1489
02:23:34,700 --> 02:23:38,660
<i>I mean it. In another world,
we actually would have been
quite good friends.</i>

1490
02:23:42,034 --> 02:23:43,868
Are you still there, Mother?

1491
02:23:44,034 --> 02:23:46,368
Your worst fear has come true.

1492
02:23:50,868 --> 02:23:52,701
<i>Alone and friendless</i>

1493
02:23:54,785 --> 02:23:56,952
<i>without a country of your own.</i>

1494
02:25:09,204 --> 02:25:12,038
We have a whole new place
to fight over.

1495
02:25:14,247 --> 02:25:15,538
The stars.

1496
02:25:20,455 --> 02:25:21,871
Your offer.

1497
02:25:25,455 --> 02:25:27,038
I have to decline.

1498
02:25:38,039 --> 02:25:41,872
You've succeeded
in stopping us
from taking back Cuba.

1499
02:25:45,580 --> 02:25:47,373
The damage is done.

1500
02:25:50,456 --> 02:25:52,832
There's no need for you
to hurt my son.

1501
02:25:59,373 --> 02:26:01,623
Let's just leave it
between you and me.

1502
02:26:06,040 --> 02:26:07,414
Very well.

1503
02:26:09,374 --> 02:26:10,748
I will wait.

1504
02:26:12,873 --> 02:26:14,915
But there will come a time

1505
02:26:16,873 --> 02:26:19,624
when I will ask you to help me
with a problem

1506
02:26:20,707 --> 02:26:24,624
that wouldn't cost you much
but be of some value to me.

1507
02:26:28,290 --> 02:26:30,874
You never know
what the future will bring.

1508
02:26:33,499 --> 02:26:36,749
Friends can be enemies,
and enemies friends.

1509
02:26:53,625 --> 02:26:54,959
This girl,

1510
02:26:57,291 --> 02:26:59,875
neither of us
can be sure about her.

1511
02:27:03,667 --> 02:27:06,626
But she's about to be
a part of your family.

1512
02:27:09,376 --> 02:27:11,167
I believe in family.

1513
02:27:16,459 --> 02:27:19,292
You want her to be
a part of your family,

1514
02:27:20,876 --> 02:27:22,210
don't you?

1515
02:27:47,210 --> 02:27:49,211
It was good to see you.

1516
02:27:51,585 --> 02:27:55,211
We will talk again,
my dear friend.

1517
02:28:03,877 --> 02:28:05,211
Sorry to bother.

1518
02:28:05,294 --> 02:28:08,461
I want to buy a little
souvenir to my daughter.
They have no change.

1519
02:28:10,128 --> 02:28:11,378
What does it cost?

1520
02:28:11,420 --> 02:28:12,878
It costs a dollar.

1521
02:28:14,878 --> 02:28:18,670
Here. It's a gift.
Regards from
the United States government.

1522
02:28:19,753 --> 02:28:22,545
It's a cardinal rule
to be generous in a democracy.

1523
02:28:27,629 --> 02:28:28,878
Thank you.

1524
02:29:22,797 --> 02:29:24,506
<i>So where is she?</i>

1525
02:29:24,631 --> 02:29:26,381
<i>We're gonna meet her
at the church.</i>

1526
02:29:26,423 --> 02:29:29,381
I can't wait to meet her.
You'll love her.
You're gonna love her.

1527
02:29:32,298 --> 02:29:33,965
Yes, that's good.

1528
02:29:49,215 --> 02:29:50,549
Come on in.

1529
02:29:59,799 --> 02:30:01,382
Hello, Margaret.

1530
02:30:05,924 --> 02:30:08,716
Let's celebrate.
I'll get some champagne.

1531
02:30:16,049 --> 02:30:17,800
How was the flight?

1532
02:30:20,216 --> 02:30:21,633
It was long.

1533
02:30:31,466 --> 02:30:33,800
How do you like
living in Phoenix?

1534
02:30:37,551 --> 02:30:39,634
It's the first time
I've slept in years.

1535
02:30:44,134 --> 02:30:45,467
Here we go.

1536
02:31:11,135 --> 02:31:12,468
To your happiness.

1537
02:31:12,719 --> 02:31:14,051
To your happiness.

1538
02:33:01,473 --> 02:33:02,890
Your wife...

1539
02:33:03,389 --> 02:33:05,181
What have you done?

1540
02:33:06,890 --> 02:33:09,140
Will you go inside, Mother?

1541
02:33:10,639 --> 02:33:12,307
Go inside, Mom.

1542
02:33:14,057 --> 02:33:16,598
Please, just go in the church.

1543
02:33:26,807 --> 02:33:28,474
She's pregnant.

1544
02:33:46,891 --> 02:33:48,725
You couldn't...
You couldn't have.

1545
02:33:50,224 --> 02:33:51,892
You couldn't.
No.

1546
02:33:52,892 --> 02:33:54,558
I love you.

1547
02:33:55,558 --> 02:33:57,350
I love you
so much.

1548
02:34:21,893 --> 02:34:23,643
- Mr. Wilson?
- Mr. Hayes.

1549
02:34:24,726 --> 02:34:27,226
Have you been here before,
Mother?
No, I haven't.

1550
02:34:28,226 --> 02:34:30,143
Whose idea was that?

1551
02:34:30,392 --> 02:34:32,060
It's classified.

1552
02:34:35,060 --> 02:34:37,726
Mr. Allen has notified
the President he'll resign.

1553
02:34:39,809 --> 02:34:42,393
<i>Something about
Swiss bank accounts.</i>

1554
02:34:44,226 --> 02:34:45,560
Where did these
come from?

1555
02:34:45,644 --> 02:34:49,226
They were in the car.
I thought you had them
sent down, sir.

1556
02:34:49,393 --> 02:34:53,310
<i>Seems the greedy
bastard has been
hiding money away for years.</i>

1557
02:34:53,685 --> 02:34:57,727
<i>Whoever had the statements
sent them to him
in a box of Swiss chocolates.</i>

1558
02:35:00,478 --> 02:35:02,394
It wasn't you, was it?

1559
02:35:05,394 --> 02:35:07,186
The President's asked me
to become Director

1560
02:35:07,227 --> 02:35:09,811
and do a complete
housecleaning
at my discretion.

1561
02:35:09,894 --> 02:35:11,353
I need someone I can trust.

1562
02:35:11,811 --> 02:35:14,144
After all,
we're still brothers.

1563
02:35:16,144 --> 02:35:18,561
This building
doesn't get built without you.

1564
02:35:18,895 --> 02:35:21,062
You're CIA's heart and soul.

1565
02:35:21,895 --> 02:35:25,937
Who knows, you might have
a secret about me
in that safe of yours.

1566
02:35:27,853 --> 02:35:32,562
This whole wing will be
your part of the world.
Counterintelligence.

1567
02:35:33,395 --> 02:35:36,062
Take a look around.
I've got an oversight meeting.

1568
02:35:36,062 --> 02:35:39,729
Can you imagine? They think
they can look into our closet.

1569
02:35:40,228 --> 02:35:41,896
As if we'll let them.

1570
02:35:45,395 --> 02:35:47,812
I remember
a senator once asked me

1571
02:35:48,479 --> 02:35:52,480
when we talk about CIA,
why we never use
the word "the" in front of it.

1572
02:35:53,396 --> 02:35:57,063
And I asked him,
"Do you put the word 'the'
in front of God?"

1573
02:36:46,190 --> 02:36:48,482
<i>"They are right
what they say about me.</i>

1574
02:36:49,482 --> 02:36:52,440
<i>"I was weak. A coward.</i>

1575
02:36:56,065 --> 02:36:57,899
<i>"I compromised myself.</i>

1576
02:36:58,690 --> 02:37:01,899
<i>"My honor. My family.
My country.</i>

1577
02:37:05,232 --> 02:37:07,233
<i>"I am ashamed of myself.</i>

1578
02:37:09,149 --> 02:37:12,483
<i>"To my wife, I am sorry
I've done this to you.</i>

1579
02:37:15,107 --> 02:37:16,566
<i>"To my son,</i>

1580
02:37:17,274 --> 02:37:20,233
<i>"I hope you will grow to be
a courageous man.</i>

1581
02:37:21,066 --> 02:37:23,900
<i>"A good husband.
A good father.</i>

1582
02:37:30,650 --> 02:37:34,566
<i>"I hope
whatever you decide to do,
you lead a good, full life.</i>

1583
02:37:40,150 --> 02:37:43,567
<i>"I hope whatever
your dreams may be come true.</i>

1584
02:37:47,150 --> 02:37:49,567
<i>"Your loving husband
and father."</i>
