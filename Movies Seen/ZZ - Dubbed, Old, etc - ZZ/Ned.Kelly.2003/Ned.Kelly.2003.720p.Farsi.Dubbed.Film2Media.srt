1
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:38,300
<i>I was the hero of Hughes Creek.</i>

2
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:50,000
<i>I can still see the glint in me da's eye
as he looked down at me...</i>

3
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:53,400
<i>his hand on me shoulder.</i>

4
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:15,000
<i>What did he call me that day?
Ah, what did Da call me?</i>

5
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:25,600
<i>That's right.
He called me Sunshine.</i>

6
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:54,200
You're a pretty girl.

7
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:59,000
You're Wild Wright's horse,
aren't ya?

8
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:02,600
I know whose ya are.
It's all right.

9
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:06,000
I'll look after ya.

10
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:38,900
<i>Handsome-looking horse you got there,
Ned. You're cuttin'a flash, all right.</i>

11
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:47,300
Ah, great.

12
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:51,400
You're Ned Kelly, aren't ya?
Red Kelly's boy?

13
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:54,800
Get down, Jane.

14
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:57,800
Fine animal you got there.

15
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:03,100
- Distinctive, wouldn't you say?
- She's Wild Wright's.

16
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:05,600
- That's the postmaster's mare.
- No, it isn't. It's Wild Wright's.

17
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:08,200
- He lost her when she bolted into the bushes.
- You're a liar, Kelly.

18
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:11,500
- No, I'm not. I found her this morning, grazing.
- She's been reported stolen.

19
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:14,400
- Stolen, me arse!
- A horse thief!

20
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:18,700
- Get your hands off me!
- You're under arrest.

21
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:25,500
Stand, Kelly, or I swear to God,
I'll shoot you down.

22
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:28,400
- I was only going after the horse.
- You were trying to escape.

23
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:32,100
You're just as thick as your bloody father.

24
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:39,100
Jesus Christ! Now, what are you trying
to do? I could've tanned your hide for that.

25
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:44,100
- Strike an officer, and you'll bloody swing for it!
- Strike you down to the ground!

26
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:46,600
- No blows struck yet, Constable Hall!
- Help me, someone!

27
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:50,400
Help him! Help Constable Hall!
Poor Constable Hall!

28
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:53,300
- He's such a fuckin' rat!
- He's trying to kill me, the rascally blackguard!

29
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:59,300
- Help me, someone!
- Stand put! Go on! Put me down!

30
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:03,600
He tried to shoot me, for Christ's sake!
All right! All right!

31
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:11,100
Is that the best you can do,
you bloody coward?

32
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:16,400
Go on. I can take it.

33
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:19,700
That's enough!

34
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:50,700
<i>Hello there! Please, can you help me?</i>

35
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:55,600
Hello! Hello there!
Please! Slow it down, please!

36
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:59,800
Come on! Come on!
Please!

37
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:05,400
Please, now! Oh, come on!
Give us a ride, you bastards!

38
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:10,600
Christ, it's muddy enough
to bog a dog.

39
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:14,700
- So, where'd you go after Beechworth?
- May Day Hills on a road gang.

40
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,800
Ah, you see Sean Gallagher?
I heard he was up there.

41
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:21,500
Yeah. I saw him
for a while.

42
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:27,000
Hey. I think that's old man Wicks and...
What's his daughter called?

43
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:29,600
- Sarah.
- Sarah. That's right. She's a picture.

44
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:33,100
Oh, we could be in love, boys.

45
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,800
Mr Wicks, good mornin'.

46
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:43,600
Mr Wicks, I don't know if you remember
me. I'm Aaron Sherritt, Mr Wicks.

47
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:47,100
- If you could just hold up for one moment...
- If anyone can persuade...

48
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:50,800
an old man to share his daughter
with three larrikins like us, it'll be hard.

49
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:53,900
So how's me ma?

50
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:57,600
- What?
- Ah, the coppers have been giving her a hard time, Ned.

51
00:07:57,900 --> 00:08:00,200
Something goes missin',
a bullock or anything...

52
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:05,300
they come round the middle of the night, tear
the place apart, scarin' the kiddies and all.

53
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:10,100
- She's had it hard.
- Come on, lads!

54
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:14,100
- Jump up!
- Well, will you look at that.

55
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:16,500
What did I tell ya?

56
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:21,000
- Thank you very much, sir.
- Thanks a lot, Mr Wicks.

57
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:24,600
Thank you, Mr Wicks.

58
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:35,100
Dan!

59
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:42,800
Ma, there's someone coming.

60
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:51,900
Oh, God. It's Ned.

61
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,500
<i>Neddy!</i>

62
00:08:58,700 --> 00:09:01,500
<i>Mommy,
I named Hobson's kookaburra.</i>

63
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:04,600
- What did you name him, darlin'?
- Beefy, 'cause he likes beef.

64
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:08,000
- Well, that's a fine name for a kookaburra, Grace.
- Who's the proud father, Ma?

65
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:12,300
Don't even ask. He's a long time gone.
That's all there is to it.

66
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:15,100
- The stinkin' Proddy.
- He was a Yank.

67
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:17,900
George the baker.
We were married, Ned, right and proper.

68
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:21,300
Well, that's grand, Ma.

69
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:23,800
Christ! Will you stop messin'?
I'm sick of the pair of ya.

70
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Give your mother some respect, or I'll give
ya a hidin', both of youse, ya hear me?

71
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,500
- And who are you, anyways?
- Steve Hart.

72
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:31,700
Well, seein' as how the two of you
are so full of beans...

73
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:34,700
you can both get off your asses
and help me fix up this place.

74
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:37,900
- You haven't done a minute's work to help your ma, have you?
- Come on, everyone.

75
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:41,500
- Sit down, now.
- What kind of stew is it?

76
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:44,800
Wombat. A wombat's a marsupial,
and it lives in a hole.

77
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,600
<i>I know, darlin;
I put one in the stew.</i>

78
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:53,100
Shh. Da-da-da. La-la-la.

79
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:56,300
Ned, would you like
to say the grace?

80
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:58,800
All right.

81
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:05,700
<i>Dear Lord, thank you for looking
after me mother...</i>

82
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:10,600
<i>me sister Grace, me sister Kate
and me brother Dan.</i>

83
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:17,000
- Thank you, Lord, for our beautiful baby Ellen...
- Shh, shh, shh.

84
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:19,900
And for this wonderful stew
made out of wombat.

85
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:22,200
- Amen.
- Amen.

86
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:24,500
Amen.

87
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:12,600
<i>It's not easy for
an Irishman in Queen Victoria's colony...</i>

88
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:15,900
<i>to walk the straight
and narrow...</i>

89
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:18,900
<i>but I toed the line...</i>

90
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:21,400
<i>despite all temptations.</i>

91
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:32,200
<i>- With me fighting
with my fists for money.</i>

92
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,600
<i>And after all, I did three years
for that stolen horse.</i>

93
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:46,800
<i>Wild Wright only got 18 months.
You think I was gonna let that one slide?</i>

94
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:56,600
I declare Ned the winner!

95
00:11:56,900 --> 00:12:01,700
Bets are in.

96
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:11,600
So, are we square?

97
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:15,700
Course we are, you mad bugger.
Come here!

98
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:18,500
Thank Christ for that!

99
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:28,900
<i>Could it be possible that
the Kellys were finally getting ahead?</i>

100
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:34,300
<i>That I could actually
better meself?</i>

101
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:45,500
<i>Steady.</i>

102
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:49,100
Excuse me.
You there.

103
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:54,500
- Would you mind coming and holding my horse's thing?
- All right.

104
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:58,200
Steady.

105
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:01,700
Now, what thing are you
talkin' about, ma'am?

106
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:05,400
Are you gonna help me
or not?

107
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:08,600
I've been riding him pretty hard
the last two days.

108
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:13,700
Poor thing's been holding on since Saturday.
His bladder's paralyzed with the colic.

109
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,600
- Good God.
- Have you got that?

110
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:21,400
- Right there. Good. Good.
- Just hold it there.

111
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:25,500
Keep still.

112
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:30,100
I'm glad that's not me. Christ.

113
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:35,500
- Steady.
- Whoa, boy. Whoa, boy.

114
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:38,700
Okay. All right.

115
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:42,900
Watch your boots, boys! Whoo!

116
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:47,200
- It looks like you've done this kind of thing before.
- Only on horses.

117
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:50,700
Thank God for that.

118
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:56,300
My name's Ned Kelly.
Pleased to meet ya.

119
00:13:56,500 --> 00:14:00,200
- Hello, Ned.
- Right.

120
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:15,600
<i>Watch out, lads! Here
he goes again! Clear the way!</i>

121
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:23,400
The horse is too wild.
It can't be broken.

122
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:27,500
A waste of damn money.
Fetch my rifle, please.

123
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:31,500
What? You can't
just shoot a horse 'cause it's wild.

124
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:37,500
- What else can we do? We can't keep it here.
- Why don't you set it free?

125
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:42,000
I could break that horse
for you if you like.

126
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:48,900
I've broken horses before. You can ask
around. I'd like to give it a try, at least.

127
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:56,500
We know there's not much point.

128
00:14:56,700 --> 00:14:59,700
The horse is bad.

129
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:18,300
You know, the Chinese say you should
have only one true love in your entire life...

130
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:22,400
otherwise you are no better than
a mangy dog or a loose woman.

131
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:24,600
What did he say?
Good thing I'm not Chinese.

132
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:26,900
What did he say?

133
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:31,900
He said what a lucky fellow I am to be
with such a beauty as you.

134
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:34,400
Too lucky, if you ask me.

135
00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:23,800
Oh, hello, Kate.
I didn't see you there.

136
00:17:24,100 --> 00:17:27,600
- Fancy seeing you here.
- I'm just having a swift pint after work.

137
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:33,000
It's not like I'm a regular or anything. A
man needs to relax after a hard day's work.

138
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:36,100
What would you know
about a hard day's work?

139
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:40,500
Sleeping and drinking and beatin' up
yellow fellows is all you ever seem to do.

140
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:44,600
That's not fair, now.
I'm only doing me job.

141
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:48,300
I get along with everybody.
Everybody gets along with me.

142
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:04,700
- Can I buy you a drink?
- No, thank you. I have money.

143
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,200
- I just wanna buy you a drink.
- I said I don't want one.

144
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:10,500
You're startin'
to get on me nerves now.

145
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:14,900
Think you're too good for me?
Is that it?

146
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:19,400
- Who do you think you are?
- Let go of me bloody arm. You're hurtin' me.

147
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:23,800
- Let go of her arm, you.
- I'm just bein' friendly, Ned.

148
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,500
Just offering
the young lady a drink.

149
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:32,100
- She doesn't want one from the likes of you.
- A problem there, Fitzpatrick?

150
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:38,200
No. There's no problem here,
Constable.

151
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:44,200
I'm sorry if I upset you...
Kate.

152
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:48,900
Right.
This one's a request from Ned Kelly.

153
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:54,700
Right.
Follow me, lads. One, two.

154
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:11,300
The nerve of the bloody knacker.
Look at him. Acts as if he owns the place.

155
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:17,400
Come here and dance
with your sister! Come on!

156
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:22,400
That fella needs taking down
a peg or two, that's for sure.

157
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:51,200
- Ned, the horses are gone.
- What?

158
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:12,300
<i>The biggest thieves and liars
the sun ever shone on.</i>

159
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:16,700
<i>The Victorian police.</i>

160
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:22,800
Well, I'm telling you something
now, boys.

161
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:26,700
I'm not gonna let these bloody maggots
put one over on me.

162
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:43,800
<i>To change a horse's brand
is easy, easier than you'd think.</i>

163
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:50,600
<i>You just pluck the little hairs
and prick the skin with iodine.</i>

164
00:21:50,900 --> 00:21:55,400
<i>A "C"or an "O"
can become a "Q. "</i>

165
00:21:55,700 --> 00:21:59,100
<i>"Q"for "Quinn"...
me mother's maiden name.</i>

166
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,600
Who's that at this hour
of the night?

167
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:37,500
- Dan, is Kate in?
- Yeah, she is.

168
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:43,000
Well, would you mind telling her I'd
like a word, please? In private, like.

169
00:22:43,300 --> 00:22:46,800
No, I won't. She wants nothing
to do with you. You know that full well.

170
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:50,100
Well, I'd like to hear that
from her, if you don't mind.

171
00:22:50,300 --> 00:22:54,200
Fitzpatrick, you've already heard that
from her many's the time.

172
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:57,500
Will you do yourself a favour.
Take a ride home.

173
00:22:57,700 --> 00:23:00,400
- You think you're so smart.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

174
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:04,300
- I've a warrant for you.
- You've no warrant, you fool.

175
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:08,100
A Kelly stole them horses. I know it was,
and I have a warrant for you.

176
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:10,400
<i>Ned and all.
I've warrants for both of ya.</i>

177
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:13,600
I don't suppose
I could see them warrants, could I?

178
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:23,700
There's your warrants.
Hmm? There's your warrants.

179
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:35,500
Oh, hello.

180
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:39,300
<i>I just came down
to find my riding jacket.</i>

181
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:43,300
I thought I left it
here somewhere.

182
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:46,300
I haven't seen it.

183
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:49,900
I was sure it was here.

184
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:55,400
If I find it, I'll be sure to bring it up
to the house for ya.

185
00:23:55,700 --> 00:23:58,500
- All right then.
- Right.

186
00:23:58,700 --> 00:24:02,500
- You're from England?
- Yes.

187
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:05,800
Surrey, actually.
You're Irish?

188
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:10,000
Yeah. Me da was from Tipperary, but I was
born here. I've never been to Ireland.

189
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:13,600
I came over when I was 17.

190
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:16,300
Richard acquired the land
through his family, and...

191
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:19,900
My da had to go to all the trouble of
stealing a sheep to get the trip over here.

192
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:24,000
He got a free fare then.
He was lucky.

193
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:26,500
Yeah.

194
00:24:37,900 --> 00:24:43,100
- How are you tonight?
- Fine. Till you showed up.

195
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:46,800
Drink, boys?

196
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:55,100
- Steve?
- I don't drink with coppers.

197
00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:01,200
Aye. There's no need for that.

198
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:10,100
So I'm leaving here tomorrow.
The work here for me is finished now.

199
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:12,700
Yes. I know.

200
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:17,500
So I won't
be seeing you any more.

201
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,200
You sure you don't want to have
a better look for that riding jacket?

202
00:25:31,100 --> 00:25:36,500
No. I... I must have
left it in the house somewhere.

203
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:41,700
Well, it was nice
to have met you.

204
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:06,800
I really should go.

205
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:12,900
I think you're the most beautiful woman
I've ever seen.

206
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:21,100
- You don't have any warrants at all, do you?
- Oh, I do, Mrs Kelly. I do.

207
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:25,100
I don't believe this.
You just plain thick or what?

208
00:26:25,300 --> 00:26:28,000
Come on, Kate.
I'm just having a bit of fun, you know.

209
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:35,400
Now, let's
see those bloody warrants.

210
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:21,700
I've split me head open!
You bastards!

211
00:27:21,900 --> 00:27:24,600
- It's your hand, you bloody idiot.
- Hey, Fitzpatrick.

212
00:27:24,700 --> 00:27:27,500
- Bottom rung on top now, huh?
- Shoot him.

213
00:27:27,700 --> 00:27:30,500
- Don't, Dan.
- Give him back his bloody gun.

214
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:40,500
Go on! Get!

215
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:44,600
I'll be back for ya,
ya bastards.

216
00:28:21,100 --> 00:28:24,100
Can you believe the brass neck
on that idiot?

217
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:27,000
Trying to be all friendly
with the grog.

218
00:28:27,100 --> 00:28:29,200
Yeah. He seemed sobered up
when you pointed the gun at him.

219
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:33,200
- See his face?
- I'm glad you think this is all very funny.

220
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:39,600
- Where have you been?
- Never mind where I've been.

221
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:46,000
- What's happened?
- Fitzpatrick couldn't hold his brandy and lemonade.

222
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:49,300
- What are you talking about?
- We had a fight with Fitzpatrick.

223
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:52,100
- A fight? Why?
- He said he had warrants for me and you.

224
00:28:52,300 --> 00:28:55,700
- What warrants?
- Horse stealing, but there was a load of shite in it.

225
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:59,400
- Whether it was or wasn't, there's trouble now either way.
- You can't take that seriously.

226
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:04,200
How can you stand there and act like this
is one big joke, after all the trouble...

227
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:07,600
<i>we've had with coppers
in this family?</i>

228
00:29:10,300 --> 00:29:15,200
- What are you thinking, Joe?
- You and Dan oughta clear out for a day or two...

229
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:17,900
just to be safe.

230
00:29:18,100 --> 00:29:21,500
<i>God willing,
it'll all blow over.</i>

231
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:45,400
What the hell
happened to you?

232
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:52,600
- Ned Kelly shot me.
- He what?

233
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:57,300
Take your rotten hands
off me, you bastard!

234
00:29:57,600 --> 00:30:01,700
- Get off her!
- You're under arrest! I'm taking you to the cells!

235
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,400
<i>You filthy bastards!</i>

236
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:10,000
Ned! Ned!

237
00:30:20,900 --> 00:30:25,200
- Ned. Jesus, Ned, they've arrested Ma.
- They what?

238
00:30:25,300 --> 00:30:28,300
Yeah. They've taken her to the cells,
charged her with attempted murder.

239
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:32,100
- Attempted murder?
- And Fitzpatrick's saying you took a shot at him.

240
00:30:32,300 --> 00:30:35,700
- I wasn't even there.
- We know that, but it's your word against his.

241
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:39,000
Take the word of a drunken liar
and arrest an innocent woman?

242
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:42,400
Is that right?

243
00:30:42,700 --> 00:30:45,500
<i>I won't take this injustice!
I'm gonna kill him!</i>

244
00:30:45,700 --> 00:30:48,000
I swear I'll scatter his blood
and brains like rain!

245
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:50,900
- Ned! Ned! No!
- Stand aside!

246
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,400
- No, Ned! Don't make this worse for Ma!
- Stop it, Ned!

247
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:09,600
Take the children inside, please.

248
00:31:18,700 --> 00:31:22,000
- What are you doing here?
- They arrested me ma.

249
00:31:22,300 --> 00:31:25,000
- What for?
- The copper says I tried to kill him.

250
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:27,500
Why?

251
00:31:27,700 --> 00:31:32,300
'Cause he's a bastard liar,
like all coppers. That's why.

252
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:36,300
The thing is,
I wasn't even there.

253
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:41,100
I was here with you.

254
00:31:41,300 --> 00:31:45,200
<i>You could tell the truth, show the
swine up for the drunken liar he is.</i>

255
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:50,000
- And then they'd have to release me ma.
- That's impossible.

256
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:54,200
I couldn't. Do you realize
what that would mean?

257
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:57,000
Yes.

258
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:04,900
I can't. I'd be disgraced.

259
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:12,800
He'd take away my children, and...

260
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:27,100
It's all right. I understand.

261
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:34,200
- Ned.
- Go ahead. Go ahead.

262
00:32:38,900 --> 00:32:41,000
Right.

263
00:33:39,300 --> 00:33:42,100
<i>I made them an offer at the outset:</i>

264
00:33:42,300 --> 00:33:44,700
<i>Charge me
and let me mother go.</i>

265
00:33:44,900 --> 00:33:49,600
<i>The answer came back:
"We don't bargain with outlaws.</i>

266
00:33:49,900 --> 00:33:52,300
<i>We'll catch you anyway. "</i>

267
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:13,400
<i>You see those stretchers?
You know what they're for?</i>

268
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:17,400
The bastards ain't plannin'
on takin' prisoners, that's for sure.

269
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:24,200
There's another party down
past the neck of Bullock Creek.

270
00:34:24,300 --> 00:34:29,100
Four of'em. They've hemmed us in
on either side, whether they know it or not.

271
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:35,100
<i>We'll come back at dawn, hold up
these two, take their guns and horses.</i>

272
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:38,200
<i>At least then we'll have a chance of
making a run for it.</i>

273
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:40,400
<i>Right.</i>

274
00:35:53,100 --> 00:35:55,200
Drop your arms!

275
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:25,900
Christ, it's Lonigan, Ned.

276
00:36:27,700 --> 00:36:31,000
<i>You've killed Lonigan.</i>

277
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:46,700
Do you want marmalade, Ned?

278
00:36:56,200 --> 00:36:59,300
Are you gonna kill me or what?

279
00:37:03,100 --> 00:37:06,900
<i>I'll leave the force first thing tomorrow
morning. I swear it on me mother's life.</i>

280
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:15,900
Ned.

281
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:23,900
- Jesus Christ.
- Do as I said, and no one will get shot.

282
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:47,900
Sergeant, you'd better surrender.
You're surrounded.

283
00:37:50,900 --> 00:37:56,200
You been into the whisky again,
you old sod?

284
00:37:56,400 --> 00:38:00,500
- Get some toast on, Lonigan.
- Lonigan's gone, and you two'll be next...

285
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:04,100
<i>If you don't get off them damn horses.</i>

286
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:34,600
Oh, Christ!

287
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:49,700
Give it up, man! It's over!

288
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:53,200
Will you stop running?
I won't shoot you. I swear.

289
00:39:12,500 --> 00:39:16,700
Why didn't you surrender?
I wouldn't have shot ya.

290
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,900
I can't breathe!

291
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:24,200
- No! I can't breathe!
- Right, right, right.

292
00:39:24,500 --> 00:39:28,200
Listen. It's okay.

293
00:39:30,300 --> 00:39:32,300
I can't breathe.

294
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:35,600
One minute. One minute. One minute.

295
00:39:35,900 --> 00:39:39,200
- It's all right. It's all right.
- Oh!

296
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:48,700
Why did you have to run?
I wouldn't have shot ya.

297
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:54,100
God damn. Look. No.

298
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:57,200
- I don't wanna die like this.
- No. No. I'm sorry I shot you.

299
00:39:57,500 --> 00:40:03,200
I don't wanna... I got a wife
and two children.

300
00:40:03,500 --> 00:40:08,400
<i>What are they gonna do without me?
What are they gonna do without...</i>

301
00:40:08,700 --> 00:40:13,000
- No!
- Look at me. Look at me.

302
00:40:13,300 --> 00:40:16,400
God forgive me!

303
00:40:39,500 --> 00:40:42,600
God forgive me.

304
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:23,900
<i>I don't know why I took his watch.</i>

305
00:41:24,100 --> 00:41:27,900
<i>It was something to do
with him not needing it.</i>

306
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:35,500
<i>Later, I thought
about sending it to his family.</i>

307
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:42,700
<i>But by then, the papers had me down
as some sort of monster...</i>

308
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:50,000
<i>so I thought,
"No point now.</i>

309
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:53,500
<i>I'm damned anyway. "</i>

310
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:09,200
Is it true what they've been saying
about the three coppers?

311
00:42:09,500 --> 00:42:11,600
Yeah, it's true.

312
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:14,000
Oh, God.

313
00:42:15,500 --> 00:42:18,800
It was a fair fight, Ma.

314
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:22,400
Better them than Ned.

315
00:42:22,600 --> 00:42:26,200
They'll kill him now.

316
00:42:26,500 --> 00:42:29,700
They'll kill him for sure.

317
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:01,000
Don't shoot, lad.
I'm unarmed.

318
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:04,100
Come on. Put that away.
There aren't any troops.

319
00:43:04,300 --> 00:43:08,400
Aw.

320
00:43:08,700 --> 00:43:12,300
- You're bloody chirpy for this hour of the morning.
- Gotta keep your voice down.

321
00:43:12,600 --> 00:43:14,600
- I've a visitor.
- Who?

322
00:43:14,700 --> 00:43:17,200
- Mary Hegarty.
- Mary Hegarty!

323
00:43:17,500 --> 00:43:20,100
- Mm.
- Jesus. She can be only 13.

324
00:43:20,300 --> 00:43:25,100
I'm not superstitious.
Well, well, well, well, well.

325
00:43:25,400 --> 00:43:30,700
I've never met a man whose lies are worth
€2,000 before, especially not Irishmen.

326
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:35,900
- It's €6,000.
- Is that what it's up to?

327
00:43:36,100 --> 00:43:38,200
<i>My cock alone's
worth more than that.</i>

328
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:40,400
I could do
with the money meself.

329
00:43:40,600 --> 00:43:43,600
I'd build a shed out the back,
buy a few horses.

330
00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:47,000
<i>In fact, I could buy half
of Beechworth with all that.</i>

331
00:43:47,300 --> 00:43:51,800
- That's very funny, Aaron.
- Clause two.

332
00:43:55,900 --> 00:44:00,100
They've recalled parliament.

333
00:44:00,300 --> 00:44:03,900
Passed something called
"The Felons Apprehension Act."

334
00:44:06,500 --> 00:44:10,100
It means we're listed as outlaws.

335
00:44:10,300 --> 00:44:14,100
We can be shot
on sight by anyone who chooses.

336
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:30,700
<i>They said
I'd lost what it meant to be human.</i>

337
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:33,300
<i>Maybe I never had it
in the first place.</i>

338
00:44:33,500 --> 00:44:39,000
<i>But wasn't this about
protecting the ones I loved...</i>

339
00:44:39,300 --> 00:44:43,100
<i>the ones who gave me food and shelter,
even the clothes on me back.</i>

340
00:44:46,600 --> 00:44:50,100
<i>And therefore,
wasn't it now a war?</i>

341
00:44:51,800 --> 00:44:57,300
Dan, you see
that wooden gate?

342
00:44:57,700 --> 00:45:00,600
Around the back there
is their living quarters.

343
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:03,800
If anyone's there,
you keep 'em there.

344
00:45:54,300 --> 00:45:57,400
- Can I help you?
- Yes, you can. Me name's Edward Kelly.

345
00:45:57,600 --> 00:46:02,200
- His mates call him Ned.
- Ned Kelly?

346
00:46:02,500 --> 00:46:06,300
- I'm sure I've heard that name somewhere bef...
- I'm sure you have, sir.

347
00:46:10,300 --> 00:46:12,900
Stay where you are.

348
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:17,200
What do you think you're doing?
Who are you?

349
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:21,000
Going to a funeral, eh?
Better do as I say, or it'll be your own.

350
00:46:21,300 --> 00:46:24,300
- Ma.
- Shh.

351
00:46:24,500 --> 00:46:27,100
- Fanny Shaw, what are you doing here?
- I work here.

352
00:46:27,300 --> 00:46:30,200
- I can't believe it.
- What are you doing here, Steve?

353
00:46:30,500 --> 00:46:36,100
We're robbing the bank. Me and Fanny
used to go to school together.

354
00:46:40,100 --> 00:46:42,900
Steve. Hello, kiddies.

355
00:46:46,900 --> 00:46:50,300
- You're Ned Kelly.
- That's right.

356
00:46:50,600 --> 00:46:53,100
What are you going
to do with us?

357
00:46:53,300 --> 00:46:55,200
You're coming with us to Faithfulls Creek.
We can't leave anyone behind...

358
00:46:55,400 --> 00:46:57,400
to raise the alarm,
now, can we?

359
00:46:57,600 --> 00:47:01,200
Mr Kelly, we are supposed
to be attending a funeral today.

360
00:47:01,400 --> 00:47:04,100
As you can see,
I'm dressed in mourning wear.

361
00:47:07,600 --> 00:47:11,800
Obviously unsuitable for a woman travelling
in the countryside, hostage or not.

362
00:47:12,100 --> 00:47:14,700
- Even a blackguard like yourself...
- Susan!

363
00:47:14,900 --> 00:47:16,900
I do apologize
for my wife's behaviour.

364
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:19,000
There is no need
to apologize on my account, Charles.

365
00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:22,300
The man is wearing a magenta cravat,
for God's sake.

366
00:47:24,200 --> 00:47:28,000
I have an outfit
just arrived from Melbourne.

367
00:47:28,200 --> 00:47:30,500
L'eau du Nil silk.

368
00:47:30,700 --> 00:47:34,100
Well, you'd better
put it on then. Go on.

369
00:47:40,500 --> 00:47:44,900
Joe, you should follow her, make sure she
doesn't signal from the windows with her bloomers.

370
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:56,600
- How dare you!
- Sure. I'm doing no harm.

371
00:48:01,800 --> 00:48:05,400
<i>What are these, these skulls?</i>

372
00:48:05,700 --> 00:48:09,400
- I collect them.
- Hello.

373
00:48:11,400 --> 00:48:15,000
So you're Joe Byrne?

374
00:48:15,100 --> 00:48:18,900
The papers say you have the facial features
of a creature born to crime.

375
00:48:19,100 --> 00:48:21,800
I'm the handsome one
in the bunch.

376
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:26,800
They also said you married a Spanish housemaid
in Diniliquin with the exotic name of Madela.

377
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:30,300
We were just good friends.

378
00:48:30,600 --> 00:48:34,600
Mm. I suppose
you have a lot of good friends.

379
00:48:39,900 --> 00:48:43,100
I'm sure there's no harm
in being friendly.

380
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:50,400
No, I don't suppose
there is.

381
00:48:52,300 --> 00:48:55,300
Oh, you're a beast...

382
00:48:55,500 --> 00:48:59,500
an absolute beast.

383
00:49:03,800 --> 00:49:07,000
She's taking an awfully long time.

384
00:49:07,300 --> 00:49:10,300
He just fell off the other side
right into a puddle.

385
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:12,500
- You'll never guess who I ran into last week.
- Who?

386
00:49:12,700 --> 00:49:17,500
Danny O'Reilly. He's working on the new
rail line. He's got a wife and three kids.

387
00:49:17,700 --> 00:49:21,600
<i>Sure. That's grand.
I haven't seen him in at least three years.</i>

388
00:49:21,900 --> 00:49:26,200
<i>That's like one kid every year.</i>

389
00:49:26,500 --> 00:49:30,600
<i>Hey, Ned. Look at this.</i>

390
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:35,900
Mortgages.
One of'em's for old man Wick's place.

391
00:49:36,300 --> 00:49:39,700
- I recognize a couple of the others too.
- They're of no use to you.

392
00:49:39,900 --> 00:49:43,500
They're the only records I have of the
bank's debtors. Can I have them back, please?

393
00:49:43,800 --> 00:49:46,600
No.

394
00:49:55,800 --> 00:49:59,000
<i>So I killed their policeman,
and I robbed their bank...</i>

395
00:49:59,200 --> 00:50:03,300
<i>but burning their mortgages... well,
that was destroying Crown property.</i>

396
00:50:03,600 --> 00:50:08,800
<i>It was like slappin'
Queen Victoria herself across the face.</i>

397
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:13,000
<i>So they send in Hare,
Superintendent Francis Hare...</i>

398
00:50:13,300 --> 00:50:17,400
<i>late of Cape Town,
South Africa.</i>

399
00:50:17,700 --> 00:50:21,300
<i>And wasn't this the challenge
of your whole life, Superintendent?</i>

400
00:50:21,500 --> 00:50:24,600
<i>A feather in your cap.
You can't catch me.</i>

401
00:50:24,900 --> 00:50:29,200
<i>You don't have a hope of catching me,
so you take my friends instead.</i>

402
00:50:29,400 --> 00:50:33,300
<i>Over a hundred men arrested,
stuck in stinkin'cells without trial...</i>

403
00:50:33,600 --> 00:50:37,600
<i>while their crops
perish in the fields.</i>

404
00:50:44,800 --> 00:50:50,500
<i>And guess what. Not one of'em
caves in and tries to claim the reward...</i>

405
00:50:50,800 --> 00:50:52,700
<i>not one of'em.</i>

406
00:50:52,900 --> 00:50:56,000
<i>They loved mejust the same
and hated you all the more, didn't they?</i>

407
00:50:56,200 --> 00:51:00,500
<i>Did you really think I was
gonna let 'em all rot?</i>

408
00:51:05,300 --> 00:51:09,500
Two and a half thousand pounds. There's enough
to pay rent on the leaseholds for lads in jail.

409
00:51:09,800 --> 00:51:12,600
Thomas, you can take what you need for
your mother to pay off her debt to McTeague.

410
00:51:12,800 --> 00:51:15,700
- Thanks, Ned.
- And there's some for McKinleys and Bill Skilling...

411
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:19,300
whatever he needs
for his da.

412
00:51:19,500 --> 00:51:22,700
Have you heard anything
about me ma?

413
00:51:22,900 --> 00:51:28,600
They set a trial at the end of last month.
She's been given three years hard labour.

414
00:51:28,900 --> 00:51:32,100
<i>I'm sorry, Ned.</i>

415
00:51:37,200 --> 00:51:40,200
I say, give me that back.

416
00:51:40,500 --> 00:51:43,000
That blackguard
just stole my watch.

417
00:51:43,200 --> 00:51:47,100
- They say the Lord helps those who help themselves.
- Give him back his watch.

418
00:51:47,200 --> 00:51:52,900
- What?
- You heard what I said. I said, give him back his damn watch.

419
00:51:53,300 --> 00:51:57,400
Have you gone simple all of a sudden?
We're robbing the bank.

420
00:51:57,700 --> 00:52:02,000
Listen here, kid. This is the last time
I tell ya... Give him back his damn watch.

421
00:52:10,300 --> 00:52:14,000
You're not innocent men.
You're a bunch of common criminals.

422
00:52:14,200 --> 00:52:18,500
Did you hear that? If we act like common
thieves, that's just what they'll call us.

423
00:52:32,500 --> 00:52:36,900
My mother is rotting away
in a prison cell...

424
00:52:37,200 --> 00:52:42,500
because of the lies
of a policeman named Fitzpatrick.

425
00:52:42,700 --> 00:52:46,800
She's an innocent woman,
and so are these boys here.

426
00:52:47,100 --> 00:52:50,900
My Irish brethren have been
unlawfully imprisoned...

427
00:52:51,100 --> 00:52:54,900
and blacklisted
from their selections.

428
00:52:55,200 --> 00:53:01,000
How do you expect me to behave other
than to stand up against this treatment?

429
00:53:03,700 --> 00:53:08,900
Any one of you here can take a shot
at me and not be charged for it.

430
00:53:09,200 --> 00:53:12,300
There's me gun.

431
00:53:13,900 --> 00:53:16,400
Any of you feeling brave enough,
go ahead.

432
00:53:17,700 --> 00:53:19,700
No?

433
00:53:21,300 --> 00:53:23,500
That's what I thought.

434
00:53:26,900 --> 00:53:29,700
So if I can beg your patience,
this is my statement...

435
00:53:29,900 --> 00:53:33,800
to the Premier of Victoria,
Graham Berry...

436
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:36,000
and you here
are my witnesses.

437
00:53:36,100 --> 00:53:39,700
Joe, take out a pen and paper.
We'll write ourselves a letter.

438
00:53:48,600 --> 00:53:51,500
Dear Sir...

439
00:53:51,700 --> 00:53:54,400
<i>Dear Sir...</i>

440
00:53:54,600 --> 00:53:56,900
"Dear Sir...

441
00:53:57,200 --> 00:54:00,600
"I wish to acquaint you
with some of the occurrences...

442
00:54:00,800 --> 00:54:03,700
"of the present,
past and future.

443
00:54:05,900 --> 00:54:10,100
It will pay government
to give those people who are suffering..."

444
00:54:10,400 --> 00:54:13,500
...justice and liberty.

445
00:54:13,700 --> 00:54:16,300
"...justice and liberty.

446
00:54:16,500 --> 00:54:22,000
"I seek revenge for the evil name
given me and my relations.

447
00:54:22,400 --> 00:54:25,300
<i>By the light that shines,
this is my warning. "</i>

448
00:54:25,500 --> 00:54:28,700
<i>My brother and sisters
and mother...</i>

449
00:54:28,800 --> 00:54:33,400
have to put up with the brutal
and cowardly conduct of a parcel of...

450
00:54:33,700 --> 00:54:37,300
- "...big, ugly..."
...big, ugly, fat- necked...

451
00:54:37,600 --> 00:54:40,300
- "...fat-necked..."
- Wombat-headed.

452
00:54:40,500 --> 00:54:42,100
Wombat-headed.

453
00:54:42,200 --> 00:54:44,800
"...wombat-headed,
big- bellied..."

454
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:48,400
- Magpie-legged! - Magpie-legged.
Thank you very much, ma'am.

455
00:54:48,700 --> 00:54:51,200
<i>Joe, write that down. Magpie-legged.</i>

456
00:54:51,400 --> 00:54:54,700
"...narrow-hipped,
splaw-footed...

457
00:54:54,900 --> 00:54:57,500
sons of Irish bailiffs..."

458
00:54:57,600 --> 00:55:01,200
Or English landlords better known
as what? Victorian police.

459
00:55:05,200 --> 00:55:10,600
This section here you might
find less amusing, Superintendent.

460
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:14,300
I give fair warning to all those
who have reason to fear me...

461
00:55:14,500 --> 00:55:16,900
not to attempt
to reside in Victoria.

462
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:21,500
<i>Neglect this
and abide by the consequences...</i>

463
00:55:21,800 --> 00:55:24,600
<i>which shall be worse
than than the rust in the wheat.</i>

464
00:55:24,700 --> 00:55:28,800
I do not wish to give this order full force
without timely warning...

465
00:55:29,100 --> 00:55:31,500
but I am a widow's son
outlawed...

466
00:55:32,900 --> 00:55:35,500
and my orders
must be obeyed.

467
00:55:40,100 --> 00:55:42,600
<i>Hey! Look! It's Ned Kelly.</i>

468
00:55:42,700 --> 00:55:45,400
- Look!
- Oh, my God.

469
00:55:45,600 --> 00:55:49,000
It's Ned Kelly and Joe Byrne.

470
00:55:51,500 --> 00:55:53,600
Can I get a kiss then?

471
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:57,000
Of course you can.

472
00:55:58,500 --> 00:56:01,200
And a ladies' man, eh?

473
00:56:02,500 --> 00:56:05,300
Where will you go, Ned?

474
00:56:06,700 --> 00:56:08,600
The country belongs to us.

475
00:56:08,700 --> 00:56:12,700
And we'll go wherever we like.

476
00:57:08,900 --> 00:57:12,800
I hear you're planning
on getting married, starting a family.

477
00:57:14,900 --> 00:57:17,200
Well, I'll tell you this, lad.

478
00:57:17,500 --> 00:57:19,700
Lack of cooperation will
make it very hard for me...

479
00:57:19,900 --> 00:57:22,400
to get you out of here
and back to that girl of yours.

480
00:57:22,600 --> 00:57:24,900
I got nothing to tell you.

481
00:57:25,100 --> 00:57:28,700
I don't need to tell you
about the reward out. It's a lot of money.

482
00:57:28,900 --> 00:57:31,500
You could put it to good use.

483
00:57:36,700 --> 00:57:40,600
You're a friend
of Joseph Byrne, aren't you?

484
00:57:40,900 --> 00:57:43,600
<i>You've known each other
since childhood...</i>

485
00:57:43,800 --> 00:57:45,700
served time together,
isn't that right?

486
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:50,900
Aaron,
it's the Kellys we want.

487
00:57:51,100 --> 00:57:53,400
We don't care about Joe.

488
00:57:53,600 --> 00:57:56,400
If we let this run its course...

489
00:57:56,700 --> 00:57:58,600
he'll be shot down
like the others.

490
00:57:58,700 --> 00:58:02,700
<i>The only chance
your friend will have...</i>

491
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:04,900
<i>depends on you.</i>

492
00:58:05,100 --> 00:58:07,500
If you'll help me with this...

493
00:58:09,200 --> 00:58:11,300
I'll guarantee his safety.

494
00:58:36,200 --> 00:58:38,300
Ned!

495
00:58:47,100 --> 00:58:49,900
<i>Jesus Christ. Come on.</i>

496
00:58:56,900 --> 00:58:59,100
Let's go.

497
00:59:41,400 --> 00:59:43,400
Sir.

498
01:00:39,600 --> 01:00:42,000
They've poisoned it.

499
01:00:48,800 --> 01:00:52,600
<i>Lying low, living in caves,
you get to learn sometimes.</i>

500
01:00:54,400 --> 01:00:59,100
<i>Eventually, you can read soils
and rocks like books.</i>

501
01:01:12,500 --> 01:01:15,200
<i>I've watched gravel fade.</i>

502
01:01:16,800 --> 01:01:19,300
<i>Dust settle into crust.</i>

503
01:01:22,600 --> 01:01:24,600
<i>I've seen drips of water...</i>

504
01:01:24,700 --> 01:01:26,900
<i>turn to stone
that defied gravity.</i>

505
01:01:39,200 --> 01:01:41,700
<i>I've turned blood red
with cave mud.</i>

506
01:02:04,500 --> 01:02:08,200
<i>I've been a bloody rock.</i>

507
01:03:57,100 --> 01:03:59,800
Aaah! Oh!

508
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:05,000
Sorry.

509
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:07,800
Wait... Please.

510
01:04:09,200 --> 01:04:11,400
Can you help...

511
01:04:11,600 --> 01:04:14,300
to scrub my back?

512
01:04:16,500 --> 01:04:18,000
I can't reach.

513
01:04:21,200 --> 01:04:23,900
Where's your husband?

514
01:04:24,100 --> 01:04:27,200
Out looking for you,
like the rest of the country.

515
01:04:31,200 --> 01:04:33,200
You took a risk
coming here.

516
01:04:35,700 --> 01:04:37,900
Well, turn me in so.

517
01:04:44,700 --> 01:04:48,500
- You think God'll forgive us for what we've done, Ned?
- I don't know.

518
01:04:50,300 --> 01:04:53,300
I suppose we're
all gonna find out one day.

519
01:04:55,900 --> 01:04:58,800
Just thinking of Ma
rottin' away in that cell.

520
01:05:06,400 --> 01:05:09,400
Where do you think Da is,
heaven or hell?

521
01:05:14,100 --> 01:05:16,700
No. He wouldn't
be in hell, you know.

522
01:05:18,400 --> 01:05:21,700
He wasn't
such a bad fella. He...

523
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:25,000
He was just a dumb paddy
who got picked on his whole life.

524
01:05:26,700 --> 01:05:29,700
And that does something
to your pride, you know?

525
01:05:29,900 --> 01:05:32,100
Can't even picture him.

526
01:05:34,900 --> 01:05:38,200
When I was 10 and
they gave me that green-and-gold sash...

527
01:05:38,500 --> 01:05:41,500
for saving that kid
from drowning...

528
01:05:41,600 --> 01:05:44,900
that was the last time
I remember him.

529
01:05:48,400 --> 01:05:51,300
He was proud of me that day.

530
01:05:55,800 --> 01:05:58,400
We gonna be okay, Ned?

531
01:06:00,500 --> 01:06:03,600
Of course we are,
you little gorn, you.

532
01:06:19,800 --> 01:06:22,900
You're just
gonna keep running, aren't you?

533
01:06:23,100 --> 01:06:25,900
They'll catch you eventually...

534
01:06:26,100 --> 01:06:28,600
or shoot you down.

535
01:06:31,400 --> 01:06:34,600
Did you know they pardoned
Frank Gardiner in New South Wales?

536
01:06:34,900 --> 01:06:36,900
On condition
he left the colony.

537
01:06:37,100 --> 01:06:40,000
- He gave himself in.
- He wasn't an Irishman.

538
01:06:40,200 --> 01:06:44,400
Then why don't you just leave the county now,
try for a new life somewhere in Queensland?

539
01:06:44,600 --> 01:06:46,900
No. I can't.
It's not about me.

540
01:06:47,100 --> 01:06:49,500
You know there's more to it
than that.

541
01:06:51,200 --> 01:06:54,200
What would it take
to make you save yourself, Ned?

542
01:06:54,400 --> 01:06:59,500
Hmm? My husband's best stallion?
Take it. It's yours. Forget the mares.

543
01:06:59,800 --> 01:07:03,100
- More than that. Much more.
- What then?

544
01:07:04,600 --> 01:07:07,500
The red one, too,
would be nice...

545
01:07:07,700 --> 01:07:10,400
with you atop of it,
beside me.

546
01:07:13,600 --> 01:07:18,000
For that you'd save yourself,
leave your friends behind?

547
01:07:20,200 --> 01:07:22,400
And you your children.

548
01:07:27,500 --> 01:07:30,200
Look.

549
01:07:30,500 --> 01:07:34,600
You and me had no business
with one another in the first place, did we?

550
01:07:34,800 --> 01:07:38,000
Wasn't that
the whole point of it?

551
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:58,100
Don't make me
grieve for you.

552
01:07:59,800 --> 01:08:02,400
I ain't dead yet.

553
01:08:19,600 --> 01:08:21,700
Rebel!

554
01:08:28,400 --> 01:08:31,600
- Kate. It's all right! It's us!
- Oh... Oh, you bloody swine!

555
01:08:31,900 --> 01:08:34,100
It's Ned. I know. Come here.

556
01:08:34,300 --> 01:08:36,800
- Oh, my God.
- Now, Gracie, look at you.

557
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:39,100
You've grown too much.
Give us a cuddle. Come on.

558
01:08:43,400 --> 01:08:45,800
Rebel, come on.
Come on.

559
01:08:52,900 --> 01:08:54,800
So...

560
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:57,600
I saw that rascal Aaron Sherritt
the other night.

561
01:08:57,800 --> 01:09:00,400
Oh, yeah?
And what did you give him?

562
01:09:00,600 --> 01:09:02,600
Nothing,
you little scoundrel.

563
01:09:02,800 --> 01:09:07,100
- Hmm.
- The thing is, I saw him talking to this fella...

564
01:09:07,400 --> 01:09:09,500
all friendly like
on the way out.

565
01:09:09,700 --> 01:09:13,300
Then the fella comes back here and starts
asking me all sorts of questions about you.

566
01:09:13,500 --> 01:09:16,400
Such as?

567
01:09:16,600 --> 01:09:19,500
When did I see you last
and where you were now...

568
01:09:19,700 --> 01:09:21,900
that sorta thing.

569
01:09:22,100 --> 01:09:25,300
- Is he a copper, do you think?
- I don't know.

570
01:09:25,600 --> 01:09:28,500
Well, it could've
been nothing.

571
01:09:28,700 --> 01:09:31,200
I just thought
you ought to know, like.

572
01:09:31,400 --> 01:09:33,400
Thanks, Maggie.

573
01:09:47,900 --> 01:09:50,300
Hello, Aaron.

574
01:09:52,300 --> 01:09:54,700
Joe?

575
01:09:54,900 --> 01:09:59,700
Ned.

576
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:02,000
So how's things, Aaron?

577
01:10:02,200 --> 01:10:04,700
Not so bad. Well...

578
01:10:04,900 --> 01:10:06,800
not too bad.

579
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:10,400
I've been reading
a lot about you, Ned.

580
01:10:10,600 --> 01:10:13,300
You're a real terror altogether,
aren't you?

581
01:10:13,500 --> 01:10:16,200
We've been meaning
to talk to you, Aaron.

582
01:10:16,400 --> 01:10:18,700
We were wondering if you'd consider
acting as a scout for us.

583
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:21,500
<i>We're heading into Beechworth
to rob a bank there.</i>

584
01:10:21,700 --> 01:10:26,700
A scout? Well, I'm flattered
you'd think of me, lads, but, uh...

585
01:10:26,900 --> 01:10:30,700
- You're not interested?
- No. I-I'd love to.

586
01:10:30,900 --> 01:10:34,900
If it was just up to me, I'd be in there
like a shot. You know that.

587
01:10:35,200 --> 01:10:37,700
But I've got the missus
to think about now.

588
01:10:37,900 --> 01:10:41,300
- Because between you and me, lads, she's up the spout.
- Ah, she isn't?

589
01:10:41,600 --> 01:10:43,500
- Ah, sure, that's grand.
- Congratulations, Aaron.

590
01:10:43,700 --> 01:10:47,500
Oh, thanks. Thanks.

591
01:10:47,700 --> 01:10:50,900
- How are Dan and Steve?
- They're fine.

592
01:10:51,200 --> 01:10:53,700
Say hello to them for me,
will you?

593
01:10:53,900 --> 01:10:57,800
We will.

594
01:10:59,200 --> 01:11:01,600
Well, I'd best
get back to the party.

595
01:11:01,800 --> 01:11:04,600
Mary will be wondering
where I got to.

596
01:11:04,800 --> 01:11:07,500
<i>Sure. You go on
and look after that girl of yours.</i>

597
01:11:07,700 --> 01:11:10,000
Ahh.

598
01:11:10,300 --> 01:11:12,300
<i>I will indeed.</i>

599
01:11:19,400 --> 01:11:24,000
Sorry I can't help you out.
Good luck with it all anyways.

600
01:12:44,300 --> 01:12:48,300
Aaron,
what are you doing?

601
01:12:55,100 --> 01:12:58,500
Some coppers on horses
followed me until Wangaratta...

602
01:12:58,800 --> 01:13:03,000
but I met up with Tom Lloyd and Bill
and we gave 'em the slip easy as you please.

603
01:13:03,300 --> 01:13:05,300
- That's good.
- Here we go.

604
01:13:14,300 --> 01:13:16,500
That's great, Katie.

605
01:13:16,600 --> 01:13:20,100
Yeah, well, I wish I'd never bloody bothered.
You're all gonna get yourselves killed.

606
01:13:20,400 --> 01:13:22,500
- We are not.
- You bloody well are!

607
01:13:22,700 --> 01:13:26,300
No, we're not, Katie. We're gonna give 'em
a show like they've never seen before.

608
01:13:31,200 --> 01:13:33,500
<i>There's a certain type of black tribesman...</i>

609
01:13:33,700 --> 01:13:35,700
<i>that bends in the wind...</i>

610
01:13:37,700 --> 01:13:39,700
<i>blends into the background.</i>

611
01:13:46,400 --> 01:13:49,000
<i>Mostly he employs
the help of the dead...</i>

612
01:13:49,200 --> 01:13:51,400
<i>to destroy other people.</i>

613
01:13:56,700 --> 01:13:59,200
<i>The "Night Dancer, "they call him.</i>

614
01:14:07,900 --> 01:14:11,000
God, when is someone gonna
give me some proper cards.

615
01:14:12,300 --> 01:14:14,400
Who's in?

616
01:14:14,600 --> 01:14:18,600
Ugh. Fold.

617
01:14:18,900 --> 01:14:22,900
- I'm turning in.
- I guess all that losin' would make you tired.

618
01:14:24,700 --> 01:14:27,900
- You in or you out?
- Gimme three.

619
01:14:28,200 --> 01:14:30,400
- You?
- I'm out.

620
01:14:37,300 --> 01:14:40,700
What's happening?

621
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:43,000
Go back to sleep, love.

622
01:14:44,200 --> 01:14:46,200
<i>Here. I call.</i>

623
01:14:46,300 --> 01:14:48,800
Three to the English queen.

624
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:51,600
It's blessed you are, Nigel.

625
01:14:53,100 --> 01:14:55,100
<i>Aaron!</i>

626
01:15:18,800 --> 01:15:21,200
- Aaron!
- Who's that?

627
01:15:21,400 --> 01:15:23,600
<i>Who is it?</i>

628
01:15:23,800 --> 01:15:26,000
Another one of your whores,
it looks like.

629
01:15:26,200 --> 01:15:29,800
<i>Just tell her to get lost,
unless she wants her head blown off.</i>

630
01:15:49,100 --> 01:15:51,800
Lizzie, is that you?

631
01:16:04,500 --> 01:16:06,400
Joe.

632
01:16:35,700 --> 01:16:38,300
Why do you think he did it?

633
01:16:40,800 --> 01:16:43,200
Just for the money?

634
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:50,800
Maybe he started thinking
he was some kind of big shot...

635
01:16:51,100 --> 01:16:54,400
<i>instead of
a shit-kicker's son, like us.</i>

636
01:17:10,500 --> 01:17:14,000
<i>We have received word
that one of our informants...</i>

637
01:17:14,200 --> 01:17:16,200
<i>has been shot dead
by the Kelly gang...</i>

638
01:17:16,200 --> 01:17:18,300
<i>over near Beechworth.</i>

639
01:17:18,500 --> 01:17:21,700
<i>We will entrain immediately
and proceed to Wangaratta.</i>

640
01:17:21,900 --> 01:17:24,200
<i>From there, you'll be
split up into units...</i>

641
01:17:24,400 --> 01:17:26,300
<i>and will fan out
across the country...</i>

642
01:17:26,500 --> 01:17:28,400
<i>encircling
the immediate vicinity.</i>

643
01:17:28,500 --> 01:17:30,800
Stay close
to your troop commanders...

644
01:17:31,000 --> 01:17:33,300
for your orders of march.

645
01:17:33,500 --> 01:17:37,200
I would remind you all...

646
01:17:37,500 --> 01:17:40,400
the men we are hunting
have not only plundered two banks...

647
01:17:40,600 --> 01:17:43,400
kidnapped
men, women and children...

648
01:17:43,700 --> 01:17:46,700
but have murdered
three of your fellow officers.

649
01:17:48,800 --> 01:17:51,000
They have outrun us before,
gentlemen.

650
01:17:51,200 --> 01:17:54,600
Do not allow them
to do so again.

651
01:17:54,800 --> 01:17:57,200
Don't you worry, sir.
We'll show the bloody animals.

652
01:17:57,400 --> 01:18:00,100
We'll blow 'em all
to kingdom come.

653
01:18:00,300 --> 01:18:04,700
These are not animals, Constable.

654
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:09,100
These are men who have been glorified
as the leaders of a movement...

655
01:18:09,400 --> 01:18:12,700
a movement that threatens the stability
of an entire country.

656
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:17,000
Underestimate them, and it will be you
who will be blown to kingdom come.

657
01:18:39,200 --> 01:18:41,100
<i>They say the trouble with the Irish...</i>

658
01:18:41,300 --> 01:18:43,400
<i>is that they rely
too much on dreams...</i>

659
01:18:43,600 --> 01:18:45,800
<i>and not enough on gunpowder.</i>

660
01:18:45,900 --> 01:18:49,200
<i>Whereas the English
were shy on dreams, as usual...</i>

661
01:18:49,500 --> 01:18:52,400
<i>but had plenty of the other.</i>

662
01:18:56,800 --> 01:18:59,000
<i>Now we had both.</i>

663
01:19:02,500 --> 01:19:06,000
- I suppose you're the Great Orlando.
- That I am.

664
01:19:06,200 --> 01:19:09,200
Well, I'm the Great Ned Kelly,
and this here is the Fabulous Joe Byrne.

665
01:19:09,500 --> 01:19:11,700
We'd like to join your circus.

666
01:19:11,900 --> 01:19:13,500
Ohh.

667
01:19:30,300 --> 01:19:32,300
Mm.

668
01:19:43,700 --> 01:19:46,800
<i>That's right. You're not
seeing things. It's a camel.</i>

669
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:50,900
I've got a lion and some ponies back down
the road. And the Great Orlando of course.

670
01:19:51,200 --> 01:19:53,500
If you're here to rob the train,
you're too late.

671
01:19:53,700 --> 01:19:55,900
We're not here
to rob the train.

672
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:43,200
Joe, get this lot inside.

673
01:20:57,900 --> 01:21:00,700
This good-looking fella
over here is me brother, Dan Kelly.

674
01:21:02,100 --> 01:21:04,000
These are my friends:

675
01:21:04,200 --> 01:21:06,700
Joe Byrne
at the bar there...

676
01:21:06,900 --> 01:21:10,600
<i>and Steve Hart
there in the back corner.</i>

677
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:17,000
And I'm Ned.

678
01:21:19,200 --> 01:21:23,300
<i>We're all Irish boys
and selectors'sons.</i>

679
01:21:25,000 --> 01:21:27,400
Had war declared on us...

680
01:21:29,200 --> 01:21:33,000
by Victoria,
by New South Wales.

681
01:21:36,100 --> 01:21:38,100
<i>By the crown.</i>

682
01:21:38,300 --> 01:21:40,800
<i>And by the London Times even.</i>

683
01:21:48,100 --> 01:21:52,000
<i>The reward on our heads is
the biggest one yet offered in the world.</i>

684
01:21:52,100 --> 01:21:54,600
It's up to €8,000.

685
01:21:54,800 --> 01:21:57,600
It's a lot of money.

686
01:22:01,300 --> 01:22:05,400
We're the only four lads
in the whole country...

687
01:22:05,700 --> 01:22:08,000
the entire empire, in fact...

688
01:22:09,900 --> 01:22:12,700
that any one of you fine citizens
is allowed to kill...

689
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:16,000
no questions asked.

690
01:22:19,700 --> 01:22:22,500
No, it's true.
The queen said so herself.

691
01:22:30,700 --> 01:22:36,300
That's right.
It's Regina versus us, the Kelly gang.

692
01:22:42,200 --> 01:22:45,200
<i>So our plans were set.</i>

693
01:22:48,600 --> 01:22:52,300
<i>One. The traitor,
Aaron Sherritt...</i>

694
01:22:52,600 --> 01:22:55,000
<i>dead, as arranged.</i>

695
01:22:58,100 --> 01:23:00,000
<i>Two.</i>

696
01:23:00,200 --> 01:23:04,300
<i>The police special from Benalla
coming to meet us.</i>

697
01:23:04,600 --> 01:23:09,200
<i>The line torn up
to send the train to hell, as arranged.</i>

698
01:23:11,400 --> 01:23:15,100
<i>Three. Superintendent Hare,
if he lives...</i>

699
01:23:15,300 --> 01:23:18,000
<i>easily worth
an outlaw's mother.</i>

700
01:23:18,300 --> 01:23:22,200
<i>And four. The townspeople
out of harm's way...</i>

701
01:23:22,400 --> 01:23:24,800
<i>drinks on us, as arranged.</i>

702
01:23:29,500 --> 01:23:32,600
- Here you go.
- Oh, lamb! My favourite.

703
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:38,000
- Ohh!
- Ohh!

704
01:23:39,500 --> 01:23:41,500
Now, cheer up there,
Mr Curnow.

705
01:23:41,600 --> 01:23:44,200
<i>You're witness to history.</i>

706
01:23:44,400 --> 01:23:47,400
How many schoolteachers
dream of that?

707
01:24:02,600 --> 01:24:04,500
Come on, Hare.
Where the hell are you?

708
01:24:39,400 --> 01:24:41,400
Were you sleeping?

709
01:24:50,200 --> 01:24:52,600
You thinking of using that?

710
01:24:54,400 --> 01:24:57,500
I'm mulling it over.

711
01:24:57,700 --> 01:25:00,200
Right.

712
01:25:01,700 --> 01:25:05,100
You don't remember me,
do you?

713
01:25:05,300 --> 01:25:07,500
You were just a boy then.

714
01:25:09,600 --> 01:25:12,600
You were riding a Palomino mare
with a white blaze.

715
01:25:23,100 --> 01:25:25,200
<i>Jane. Yeah.</i>

716
01:25:25,400 --> 01:25:27,100
Yeah.

717
01:25:29,300 --> 01:25:32,800
Seems like a long time ago,
doesn't it?

718
01:25:36,500 --> 01:25:38,500
A lifetime.

719
01:26:04,300 --> 01:26:06,500
Where's the other fella?

720
01:26:17,600 --> 01:26:19,600
Where's Curnow?

721
01:26:22,800 --> 01:26:24,700
Ned, Curnow's gone!

722
01:26:27,900 --> 01:26:30,800
<i>Come on!
Give me a hand here!</i>

723
01:26:36,100 --> 01:26:38,000
Quickly!

724
01:26:38,100 --> 01:26:40,100
Get those horses off!

725
01:27:00,900 --> 01:27:03,200
Knights in shining armour.

726
01:27:14,300 --> 01:27:17,700
- Curnow stopped the train.
- Jesus.

727
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:21,900
- What does this mean?
- Hare's on his way.

728
01:27:22,100 --> 01:27:24,700
You mean we didn't
get any of'em?

729
01:27:25,000 --> 01:27:26,900
Not a soul.

730
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:33,000
There'll be a hundred
of them... at least.

731
01:27:47,300 --> 01:27:50,100
You okay, Dan?

732
01:27:51,900 --> 01:27:55,300
Yeah, I'm okay, Ned.

733
01:27:59,400 --> 01:28:01,500
Steve?

734
01:28:01,700 --> 01:28:04,900
Short life,
but a merry one.

735
01:28:07,800 --> 01:28:12,200
- Joe?
- We're gonna give them a good old fight, aren't we?

736
01:28:15,600 --> 01:28:18,500
Well, that's that then.

737
01:28:18,800 --> 01:28:21,200
All right.
Everyone listen to me!

738
01:28:21,400 --> 01:28:24,300
We're getting you
out of here!

739
01:29:03,200 --> 01:29:05,700
<i>Hold your fire!</i>

740
01:29:05,900 --> 01:29:08,600
<i>We've got women
and children coming out.</i>

741
01:29:30,200 --> 01:29:32,500
<i>It's a trick!</i>

742
01:29:40,500 --> 01:29:42,800
Stop your fire!
Cease fire!

743
01:29:46,100 --> 01:29:48,500
<i>Hold your fire!</i>

744
01:29:48,600 --> 01:29:50,400
Cease fire!

745
01:29:50,600 --> 01:29:53,200
Get down on the floor!

746
01:29:55,700 --> 01:29:59,000
Keep your heads down!
Stay on the floor!

747
01:29:59,300 --> 01:30:01,500
They fired at us!
They shot him!

748
01:30:01,600 --> 01:30:03,800
Keep as low as you can,
you hear?

749
01:30:03,900 --> 01:30:06,300
All right.
Let's give it to 'em.

750
01:30:06,500 --> 01:30:08,600
Hit the lights.

751
01:30:23,600 --> 01:30:25,600
Fire!

752
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:11,900
They have armour
on their bodies!

753
01:31:12,100 --> 01:31:13,900
<i>Aim for their arms
and legs!</i>

754
01:31:25,700 --> 01:31:27,700
- Ohhh! Ahhh.
- He's been shot!

755
01:31:27,900 --> 01:31:31,000
- They've shot Hare!
- All right. Get back inside.

756
01:31:31,200 --> 01:31:34,600
<i>Get back inside.
Come on.</i>

757
01:31:44,200 --> 01:31:46,800
Oh! Dan,
reload me pistols!

758
01:31:48,100 --> 01:31:50,500
I got the bastard
that shot me.

759
01:31:50,600 --> 01:31:52,700
Give me that anyways. Rifle!

760
01:31:56,200 --> 01:31:58,600
Bullets. Come on.

761
01:32:23,100 --> 01:32:26,000
Aw. The monkey's been shot!

762
01:32:26,200 --> 01:32:28,900
<i>Poor little bugger!</i>

763
01:32:31,300 --> 01:32:33,300
Ah, dear God.

764
01:32:34,700 --> 01:32:36,500
Oh! Shit.

765
01:32:42,800 --> 01:32:44,800
Somebody help me,
for Christ's sake!

766
01:32:45,000 --> 01:32:47,300
<i>Keep low! Get around
the back of the bar!</i>

767
01:33:01,800 --> 01:33:04,400
Can you find me something
to stop the bleeding?

768
01:33:06,000 --> 01:33:07,900
<i>Get down!</i>

769
01:33:08,100 --> 01:33:11,600
To hell with all you bastards!

770
01:33:45,300 --> 01:33:49,300
Ned! Where the hell
are you going?

771
01:33:49,500 --> 01:33:51,700
Get this lot around the back.

772
01:34:20,100 --> 01:34:21,900
Ned?

773
01:34:25,600 --> 01:34:27,400
Now's your chance. Quickly!

774
01:34:27,600 --> 01:34:29,900
<i>Out that back door there!</i>

775
01:34:36,600 --> 01:34:38,000
Aaah!

776
01:34:38,200 --> 01:34:40,700
Ohhh!

777
01:35:00,200 --> 01:35:03,400
Hands up, the lot of you,
or you'll be shot down like dogs!

778
01:35:03,600 --> 01:35:05,600
Don't shoot!

779
01:35:09,900 --> 01:35:12,000
I got him!
I got Dan Kelly!

780
01:35:13,200 --> 01:35:16,000
No, you bloody well haven't.

781
01:35:29,400 --> 01:35:31,600
Jesus Christ, lads.

782
01:35:32,900 --> 01:35:35,100
I think I need a drink.

783
01:36:43,000 --> 01:36:46,900
<i>What I best recall is riding alone...</i>

784
01:36:49,300 --> 01:36:51,700
<i>with the sun behind me...</i>

785
01:36:51,900 --> 01:36:54,500
<i>seeing me own shadow
cantering ahead...</i>

786
01:36:54,700 --> 01:36:57,400
<i>against the roadside weeds
and willows...</i>

787
01:36:59,100 --> 01:37:02,200
<i>and leaving me
stretched far behind...</i>

788
01:37:02,400 --> 01:37:04,300
<i>galloping to chase it...</i>

789
01:37:07,600 --> 01:37:11,000
<i>Like a centaur
in the picture books.</i>

790
01:38:05,800 --> 01:38:07,800
Well done, Ned.

791
01:38:13,600 --> 01:38:16,200
<i>I wore it seriously...</i>

792
01:38:16,400 --> 01:38:19,800
<i>me hero sash
of green and gold.</i>

793
01:38:25,000 --> 01:38:28,000
<i>Proof that
I've saved a life as well.</i>

794
01:39:15,900 --> 01:39:19,200
I'm out of rounds.

795
01:39:19,400 --> 01:39:22,500
Do you have any left?

796
01:39:29,400 --> 01:39:31,400
Only two.

797
01:39:34,800 --> 01:39:38,200
I guess that's
all we need then, isn't it?

798
01:39:39,600 --> 01:39:41,600
We never stood a chance, did we?

799
01:40:18,000 --> 01:40:20,400
No.

800
01:40:24,500 --> 01:40:26,500
Steve.

801
01:40:27,700 --> 01:40:29,800
No.

802
01:42:13,100 --> 01:42:16,300
It's Ned Kelly.
Christ almighty, it's Ned Kelly.

803
01:43:49,700 --> 01:43:52,500
Do you mind if I have this?

804
01:44:08,700 --> 01:44:11,900
<i>Hey! Look! It's Ned Kelly!</i>

805
01:44:12,000 --> 01:44:14,800
Ned!
Hey, Ned!

806
01:44:25,600 --> 01:44:28,000
<i>Such is life.</i>

807
01:44:28,100 --> 01:44:33,100
Despite petitions for a pardon that bore
a total of 32,000 signatures...

808
01:44:33,400 --> 01:44:36,700
Ned Kelly was hanged
on 11 th of November, 1880.

809
01:44:40,600 --> 01:44:45,800
He was 25 years old.
