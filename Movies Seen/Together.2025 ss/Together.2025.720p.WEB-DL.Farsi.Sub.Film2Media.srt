(police radio)

00:01:58,400 --> 00:01:58,880
(police radio)

5
00:01:58,881 --> 00:01:59,920
Still no sign, over.

6
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:02,600
I'm going to try that down.

7
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:09,840
(Dog growling)

00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:11,160
SIRN.

9
00:04:13,990 --> 00:04:14,350
SIRN.

10
00:04:14,351 --> 00:04:14,890
SIRN.

11
00:04:14,891 --> 00:04:15,891
SIRN.

12
00:04:39,590 --> 00:04:40,590
SIRN.

13
00:04:41,430 --> 00:04:42,430
SIRN.

14
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:55,900
Hey, is everything okay?

15
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:58,480
Sorry, just looking for a record.

16
00:05:59,380 --> 00:05:59,840
Well, come on.

17
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:02,160
We're not gonna see everyone for a while.

18
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:03,460
Alright, sorry.

19
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:06,960
By the way, everyone thinks it's cute.

20
00:06:07,140 --> 00:06:08,140
We're matching.

21
00:06:14,110 --> 00:06:15,110
Babe?

22
00:06:15,630 --> 00:06:16,770
Yeah, just give me a sec.

23
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:28,390
You really agree to go along with this?

24
00:06:29,450 --> 00:06:31,190
Yes, he's excited.

25
00:06:31,810 --> 00:06:33,210
Are you sure it's what you want?

26
00:06:33,670 --> 00:06:34,670
What do you mean?

27
00:06:35,310 --> 00:06:38,170
You know, I loved him, but he hasn't been
that to him in a while.

28
00:06:38,910 --> 00:06:42,150
Aren't you worried about how long it's
been since the two of you have,

29
00:06:42,290 --> 00:06:44,369
like, you know, why
don't you take the job

30
00:06:44,370 --> 00:06:46,450
and find a country boy
who actually fucks you?

31
00:06:46,850 --> 00:06:47,850
Hey.

32
00:06:48,610 --> 00:06:49,610
Oh, sick.

33
00:06:49,710 --> 00:06:51,110
I know you still did music.

34
00:06:51,830 --> 00:06:54,730
Yeah, actually just finishing up a new EP.

35
00:06:55,150 --> 00:06:55,490
Sick.

36
00:06:55,491 --> 00:06:56,811
Hey, you still on the same label?

37
00:06:57,970 --> 00:06:59,370
Probably self-releasing this time.

38
00:07:00,170 --> 00:07:02,866
But, uh, hey, I heard you guys got booked
on the whole Sound Off tour.

39
00:07:02,890 --> 00:07:03,670
That's awesome.

40
00:07:03,910 --> 00:07:05,470
Dude, you gotta get back on the label.

41
00:07:05,650 --> 00:07:07,170
They just booked you on so much stuff.

42
00:07:07,670 --> 00:07:08,670
That's so true.

43
00:07:08,830 --> 00:07:10,630
Yeah, no, I should just get back on the
label.

44
00:07:11,010 --> 00:07:12,250
He's still going through a lot.

45
00:07:12,830 --> 00:07:15,990
Honestly, it's another reason why I think
this move will be good for both of us.

46
00:07:16,450 --> 00:07:17,450
Okay.

47
00:07:17,650 --> 00:07:18,950
This is so exciting.

48
00:07:19,470 --> 00:07:20,510
Do you think he knows?

49
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:24,490
He has no idea.

50
00:07:25,230 --> 00:07:27,730
You know, we need a guitarist for the
tour.

51
00:07:28,190 --> 00:07:29,190
What, for real?

52
00:07:29,270 --> 00:07:31,950
I figured, you know, with the move,
that you're written off.

53
00:07:32,310 --> 00:07:33,310
Shit.

54
00:07:33,710 --> 00:07:36,510
I mean, I could check in with Millie,
but...

55
00:07:37,950 --> 00:07:40,890
When you started dating my sister,
I thought you might make her cooler.

56
00:07:41,270 --> 00:07:43,010
Instead, she's just made you.

57
00:07:43,130 --> 00:07:44,250
Hey, fuck you, man.

58
00:07:44,570 --> 00:07:45,090
That's cool.

59
00:07:45,250 --> 00:07:49,691
It's just, when I die, I don't want someone
else's life flashing before my eyes.

60
00:07:56,470 --> 00:07:57,470
I'll do it.

61
00:07:57,530 --> 00:07:58,070
The tour.

62
00:07:58,490 --> 00:07:59,490
Oh, that's dope.

63
00:07:59,610 --> 00:08:01,410
Eh, there's a lot of rehearsals.

64
00:08:01,590 --> 00:08:02,590
I'll make it back.

65
00:08:02,650 --> 00:08:03,710
It's not even that far.

66
00:08:03,890 --> 00:08:05,710
And it's so fucking far.

67
00:08:06,950 --> 00:08:08,890
And look, this isn't that big of a deal.

68
00:08:09,070 --> 00:08:10,270
It's just a couple hours away.

69
00:08:10,271 --> 00:08:11,010
He says a prick.

70
00:08:11,011 --> 00:08:12,011
He can't drive.

71
00:08:12,530 --> 00:08:14,170
Hey, who needs to drive in the city?

72
00:08:15,830 --> 00:08:18,430
Obviously, we're, uh, we're gonna miss you
guys a lot.

73
00:08:19,590 --> 00:08:24,350
This insane group is, you know,
it's, uh, it's the family I got.

74
00:08:24,770 --> 00:08:25,770
So?

75
00:08:26,790 --> 00:08:29,650
Um, but I, I'm so proud of Millie.

76
00:08:30,570 --> 00:08:34,810
You are the sweetest, most giving person
I've ever met.

77
00:08:35,590 --> 00:08:37,674
These kids don't even know
how lucky they are to get

78
00:08:37,675 --> 00:08:39,771
someone who actually
cares about their education.

79
00:08:41,470 --> 00:08:44,530
So, uh, yeah, it's, it's all bittersweet.

80
00:08:45,410 --> 00:08:48,623
I'm a little scared,
but, uh, mainly excited

81
00:08:48,624 --> 00:08:52,151
about the next step
in our lives together.

82
00:08:52,730 --> 00:08:53,270
Woo!

83
00:08:53,271 --> 00:08:54,271
Yeah.

84
00:08:55,270 --> 00:08:56,270
That's it.

85
00:09:00,730 --> 00:09:01,830
Okay, relax.

86
00:09:01,831 --> 00:09:03,470
It's just a change of scenery.

87
00:09:04,550 --> 00:09:05,550
Babe.

88
00:09:08,860 --> 00:09:14,035
In front of the people who
mean the most to us, I want

89
00:09:14,036 --> 00:09:17,361
to ask you to spend the
rest of your life with me.

90
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:22,500
Are you joking?

91
00:09:27,970 --> 00:09:28,970
Um.

92
00:09:37,830 --> 00:09:38,090
Oh.

93
00:09:38,410 --> 00:09:40,250
Yeah, yes, of course, yes.

94
00:09:40,490 --> 00:09:41,650
I, I, I do.

95
00:09:41,651 --> 00:09:50,780
I, I'm sorry.

96
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:53,640
I fucking suck, okay?

97
00:09:53,780 --> 00:09:56,060
I just, I, I didn't know what was
happening and I froze.

98
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:57,440
You still want this, right?

99
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:01,140
It's a little late now, right?

100
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:04,160
Yeah, it fucking is.

101
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:09,360
But still, if we don't split now,
it'll only be harder later.

102
00:10:09,980 --> 00:10:10,080
What?

103
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:12,980
Wait, wait, wait, like split-split?

104
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:14,440
Is that what you want?

105
00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:15,940
No, of course not.

106
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:17,560
I don't know.

107
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:26,160
You've been so distant since, and that's
okay, of course.

108
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:32,480
It's just, you've never made me feel
unsure before.

109
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:34,700
Unsure of what?

110
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:41,020
If we love each other, or if we're just
used to each other.

111
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:42,500
Hey.

112
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:43,000
Hey.

113
00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:44,380
I'm sorry, okay?

114
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:46,400
Sorry.

115
00:10:58,270 --> 00:11:00,110
I, I think I drank too much.

116
00:11:01,710 --> 00:11:02,710
It's okay.

117
00:11:03,050 --> 00:11:05,050
Hey, hey, I love you, I love you.

118
00:11:06,470 --> 00:11:07,470
I love you too.

119
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:25,320
Everyone knows you need me more than I
need you.

120
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:27,360
We laugh about it.

121
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:29,240
What?

122
00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:32,900
Resenting me doesn't make you less of a
failure.

123
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:36,740
Why are you saying this?

124
00:11:39,020 --> 00:11:40,840
Can you ask them to leave?

125
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:43,060
Who?

126
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,900
I can't sleep with them staring at us.

127
00:12:27,270 --> 00:12:28,270
Good morning.

128
00:12:29,050 --> 00:12:31,070
You clearly don't miss the sound of
traffic.

129
00:12:32,130 --> 00:12:33,150
How long you been up?

130
00:12:33,310 --> 00:12:33,970
Not long.

131
00:12:34,250 --> 00:12:36,570
Figured one of these had to have the
coffee machine inside.

132
00:12:37,670 --> 00:12:38,970
Do you think I resent you?

133
00:12:40,010 --> 00:12:41,010
Well, now.

134
00:12:41,970 --> 00:12:42,450
Sorry.

135
00:12:42,890 --> 00:12:44,050
Still half asleep.

136
00:12:44,990 --> 00:12:46,530
Because you're looking at your dream,
girl.

137
00:12:46,531 --> 00:12:47,650
That must be it.

138
00:12:49,670 --> 00:12:51,790
Since you're out here, can you bring
something inside?

139
00:12:51,910 --> 00:12:52,250
Sure.

140
00:12:52,510 --> 00:12:52,670
Yeah.

141
00:12:53,410 --> 00:12:53,570
Oh!

142
00:12:53,571 --> 00:12:54,571
Help!

143
00:12:54,710 --> 00:12:55,710
Oh my goodness.

144
00:12:58,430 --> 00:12:59,430
Don't let me say no!

145
00:13:17,490 --> 00:13:18,630
This is worrying.

146
00:13:19,590 --> 00:13:20,590
Your dad's?

147
00:13:20,930 --> 00:13:22,890
Maybe I could use it to fix the back
porch.

148
00:13:25,390 --> 00:13:26,790
Never let me use that.

149
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:38,530
Babe, do you smell that?

150
00:13:39,550 --> 00:13:40,550
I'm peeing.

151
00:13:43,770 --> 00:13:45,250
You really don't smell anything?

152
00:13:46,310 --> 00:13:47,410
What's going on?

153
00:14:49,690 --> 00:14:50,690
Babe?

154
00:14:50,950 --> 00:14:51,950
What are you doing?

155
00:14:52,150 --> 00:14:52,890
I found it.

156
00:14:53,050 --> 00:14:53,310
What?

157
00:14:54,070 --> 00:14:55,070
Oh!

158
00:15:08,660 --> 00:15:09,660
Oh, God.

159
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:12,040
How'd you know to look for that?

160
00:15:28,110 --> 00:15:29,110
Excuse me.

161
00:15:29,630 --> 00:15:30,030
Hi.

162
00:15:30,270 --> 00:15:32,490
Would you bring that from home or take it
from my tin?

163
00:15:33,130 --> 00:15:34,130
What?

164
00:15:34,950 --> 00:15:36,170
Oh, sorry.

165
00:15:36,370 --> 00:15:38,370
I thought that they were just for the
staff.

166
00:15:38,810 --> 00:15:39,810
But I don't have...

167
00:15:42,610 --> 00:15:43,610
Sugar?

168
00:15:43,770 --> 00:15:44,830
No, thank you.

169
00:15:47,050 --> 00:15:48,510
How much trouble am I in?

170
00:15:48,710 --> 00:15:49,710
Oh, God.

171
00:15:49,850 --> 00:15:50,850
Don't mind Carol.

172
00:15:51,090 --> 00:15:54,510
She's possessive of dry old bags on
account of her being one.

173
00:15:55,750 --> 00:15:57,510
It's Mrs. Wilson, right?

174
00:15:58,070 --> 00:15:59,070
Millie.

175
00:15:59,110 --> 00:16:00,110
I'm Jamie.

176
00:16:00,150 --> 00:16:00,550
Welcome.

177
00:16:00,551 --> 00:16:01,551
Thank you.

178
00:16:01,590 --> 00:16:05,850
I gotta say, I was so happy you took this
placement.

179
00:16:06,270 --> 00:16:07,930
Your resume really caught my eye.

180
00:16:08,390 --> 00:16:09,390
You saw that?

181
00:16:09,430 --> 00:16:11,590
Yeah, well, it's part of the hiring
committee.

182
00:16:12,430 --> 00:16:12,770
Wanna sit?

183
00:16:12,990 --> 00:16:16,546
Yeah, I was just thrilled
that someone of your

184
00:16:16,547 --> 00:16:19,350
caliber was interested in
our tiny neck of the woods.

185
00:16:19,630 --> 00:16:20,630
Oh, are you kidding?

186
00:16:20,790 --> 00:16:21,790
I'm excited.

187
00:16:22,050 --> 00:16:23,550
My old school was huge.

188
00:16:24,110 --> 00:16:26,070
Students and staff all lost in the
shuffle.

189
00:16:26,071 --> 00:16:30,290
Here I'm hoping to actually help these
kids as individuals.

190
00:16:30,750 --> 00:16:31,770
Oh, passion!

191
00:16:32,350 --> 00:16:34,170
Almost forgot what that was like.

192
00:16:34,910 --> 00:16:36,730
And you settling in okay?

193
00:16:37,250 --> 00:16:38,710
You and your husband?

194
00:16:39,110 --> 00:16:40,110
Sorry, your wife?

195
00:16:40,150 --> 00:16:43,690
Or... Me and my... God,
boyfriend sounds so immature.

196
00:16:44,490 --> 00:16:44,790
Partner?

197
00:16:45,350 --> 00:16:46,170
My... Tim?

198
00:16:46,430 --> 00:16:48,370
My... Me and my
boy partner, Tim.

199
00:16:49,330 --> 00:16:51,970
Have you, uh... Have
you explored much?

200
00:16:53,770 --> 00:16:54,770
Partners?

201
00:16:55,690 --> 00:16:56,690
Oh, God, no.

202
00:16:56,770 --> 00:16:56,910
No.

203
00:16:57,050 --> 00:16:58,050
No, the area.

204
00:16:58,270 --> 00:17:00,810
Have you... Have you...
Like, where did you move to?

205
00:17:01,010 --> 00:17:03,310
We, uh... We're down
at the end of Pit Road.

206
00:17:04,010 --> 00:17:07,750
This is so predictably small town,
to say this, but I think we're neighbors.

207
00:17:08,830 --> 00:17:10,390
I'm the yellow house on the corner.

208
00:17:10,710 --> 00:17:11,710
Oh, you're kidding.

209
00:17:11,790 --> 00:17:11,990
Yeah.

210
00:17:12,110 --> 00:17:13,210
It's a great spot.

211
00:17:13,390 --> 00:17:17,390
I mean, it's a little ways from town,
but the woods and the trails are amazing.

212
00:17:19,050 --> 00:17:25,090
Well, uh, let me know if, uh, you ever
need someone to show you around.

213
00:17:25,370 --> 00:17:25,770
Yeah.

214
00:17:26,270 --> 00:17:27,410
You and your boy partner.

215
00:17:28,610 --> 00:17:29,050
Sure.

216
00:17:29,310 --> 00:17:30,090
Have a good day.

217
00:17:30,210 --> 00:17:31,210
Bye.

218
00:17:45,140 --> 00:17:45,860
How's it going?

219
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:46,280
Hey.

220
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:47,920
Oh, do we have internet?

221
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:49,560
Uh, guys, coming next week.

222
00:17:51,180 --> 00:17:53,980
Hey, you obviously can't drive me back for
this gig on Thursday, right?

223
00:17:54,260 --> 00:17:55,780
I could take you to the train station.

224
00:17:57,060 --> 00:17:58,140
Okay, yeah, thanks.

225
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:06,340
I have to learn these parts.

226
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:08,640
Okay.

227
00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:10,100
Uh, what about tomorrow?

228
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:14,040
Do you maybe want to do that hike you were
telling me about?

229
00:18:15,180 --> 00:18:16,180
Yeah, that'd be great.

230
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:17,740
Great.

231
00:18:21,030 --> 00:18:21,430
Okay.

232
00:18:21,730 --> 00:18:22,090
Okay.

233
00:18:22,290 --> 00:18:22,790
Love you.

234
00:18:23,070 --> 00:18:23,450
Love you.

235
00:18:23,451 --> 00:18:24,451
Thank you.

236
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:16,280
Is this it?

237
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:17,900
I don't know.

238
00:19:18,340 --> 00:19:19,820
Here, this feels short.

239
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:21,700
Did we miss something?

240
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:23,320
Yeah, what about that?

241
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:30,150
Seems pretty overgrown.

242
00:19:31,260 --> 00:19:34,760
Hun, I don't want to be the dumb city folk
who went against nature and lost.

243
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:41,340
It's marked, we're good.

244
00:19:50,420 --> 00:19:51,420
Babe.

245
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:53,380
We can always turn back.

246
00:19:53,381 --> 00:19:55,141
It's just... It's so nice out.

247
00:20:00,020 --> 00:20:01,380
Okay, wait, I think it's this way.

248
00:20:01,580 --> 00:20:03,160
Wait, I think it was back there.

249
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:04,900
Are you sure?

250
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:06,520
No, are you?

251
00:20:16,940 --> 00:20:18,080
Okay, that way's north.

252
00:20:18,660 --> 00:20:19,660
Okay.

253
00:20:22,430 --> 00:20:23,310
What do we do with that?

254
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:23,830
I don't know.

255
00:20:24,410 --> 00:20:25,650
I thought it would be helpful.

256
00:20:26,330 --> 00:20:27,330
Okay.

257
00:20:27,690 --> 00:20:30,150
What if we just keep going sort of
southeast-ish?

258
00:20:30,170 --> 00:20:31,370
Can we just sink for a second?

259
00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:32,510
No, no, no, babe.

260
00:20:32,590 --> 00:20:33,110
This looks right.

261
00:20:33,270 --> 00:20:34,270
Come on.

262
00:20:35,370 --> 00:20:36,370
Oh, my God.

263
00:20:36,910 --> 00:20:37,910
Oh, my God.

264
00:20:38,610 --> 00:20:39,610
Honey.

265
00:20:40,050 --> 00:20:41,050
Oh, my God.

266
00:20:41,670 --> 00:20:47,060
Oh, my God.

267
00:20:47,180 --> 00:20:48,220
Oh, God.

268
00:20:48,221 --> 00:20:52,920
Oh, my God.

269
00:20:53,420 --> 00:20:54,420
No!

270
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:56,280
No!

271
00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:02,220
Oh, God.

272
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:03,480
Are you okay?

273
00:21:03,820 --> 00:21:05,640
My legs are-Oh, God.

274
00:21:05,660 --> 00:21:06,660
Oh, God.

275
00:21:13,420 --> 00:21:14,420
My phone.

276
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:15,940
Shit.

277
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:17,280
Can you call it?

278
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:20,900
I don't have signal.

279
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:22,120
Fuck.

280
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:23,840
My demos were on there.

281
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:26,660
I'm fine, by the way.

282
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:29,320
Hey, sorry, you okay?

283
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:30,040
Yeah, I'm fine.

284
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:30,500
You sure?

285
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:31,640
Okay.

286
00:21:40,290 --> 00:21:41,410
What is this place?

287
00:21:50,610 --> 00:21:51,610
Do you feel that?

288
00:21:52,750 --> 00:21:54,991
It feels... Crowded.

289
00:21:58,600 --> 00:21:59,680
Better get out of here.

290
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:01,460
What, back into the storm?

291
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:15,380
What is all this?

292
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:29,040
We can build a fire.

293
00:22:29,420 --> 00:22:30,420
Wait it out.

294
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:31,480
Wait it out later.

295
00:22:33,140 --> 00:22:34,760
Does that really matter right now?

296
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:38,280
How big is this place?

297
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:40,200
Let me check.

298
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:42,280
Hello!

299
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:46,100
Well?

300
00:22:47,140 --> 00:22:48,140
Pretty big.

301
00:22:58,160 --> 00:22:59,160
Honey.

302
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:01,380
What are you doing?

303
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:04,780
Remember when we used to watch Man Vs.

304
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:05,100
Wild?

305
00:23:05,460 --> 00:23:07,360
Yeah, you fucking don't.

306
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:08,960
Okay.

307
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:10,160
Thank you.

308
00:23:16,310 --> 00:23:17,910
I am so thirsty.

309
00:23:18,850 --> 00:23:19,850
Yeah, me too.

310
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:26,000
Is that all we have?

311
00:23:26,660 --> 00:23:27,660
Yeah.

312
00:23:31,070 --> 00:23:32,150
You think that's drinkable?

313
00:23:32,950 --> 00:23:34,450
I'm not drinking it.

314
00:23:35,630 --> 00:23:36,910
Alright, finish this.

315
00:23:37,710 --> 00:23:38,710
What about you?

316
00:23:41,450 --> 00:23:42,950
I found another bottle.

317
00:23:44,490 --> 00:23:45,490
Oh God.

318
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:52,240
What's that?

319
00:23:52,420 --> 00:23:53,620
The other bottle.

320
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:56,040
Babe.

321
00:23:56,820 --> 00:23:58,140
I wouldn't.

322
00:23:59,080 --> 00:23:59,920
Man Vs.

323
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,000
Wild, babe.

324
00:24:07,820 --> 00:24:09,100
No, it's fine.

325
00:24:09,620 --> 00:24:10,620
Here.

326
00:24:32,420 --> 00:24:34,700
So, about that later.

327
00:24:41,620 --> 00:24:42,620
When?

328
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:44,080
Just before the move.

329
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:44,720
You?

330
00:24:44,721 --> 00:24:45,880
The same.

331
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:56,540
When we're out of here, we'll both stop
again.

332
00:24:56,700 --> 00:24:57,700
Definitely.

333
00:24:58,340 --> 00:25:02,360
For now, it's a nice distraction from all
the rats that must be down here.

334
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:06,020
I keep thinking about that thing you found
the other day.

335
00:25:07,180 --> 00:25:08,180
Me too.

336
00:25:10,980 --> 00:25:11,980
Hey.

337
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:13,440
What happened there?

338
00:25:19,380 --> 00:25:25,700
When I was a kid, my dad comes home one
day and tells me to clean my room.

339
00:25:26,180 --> 00:25:27,680
Because he says there's a smell.

340
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:29,480
So, I clean it.

341
00:25:30,860 --> 00:25:33,260
Next day, he comes home, says it's still
there.

342
00:25:33,580 --> 00:25:34,700
So, I clean it again.

343
00:25:35,460 --> 00:25:36,780
The day after that, he comes in.

344
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:39,160
But, this time he's freaking out.

345
00:25:39,161 --> 00:25:41,520
He's like, what is that goddamn smell?

346
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:43,900
And he just starts tearing my room apart.

347
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:45,840
But, can't find anything.

348
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:50,180
At this point, I'm scared because there is
no smell.

349
00:25:50,620 --> 00:25:52,700
You know, I don't know why he's getting so
worked up.

350
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:58,240
Anyway, I, um, come home from school the
next day.

351
00:25:58,680 --> 00:26:00,000
And I go in my room.

352
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:03,940
And he's standing there with this wicked
grin.

353
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:06,080
Because he found it.

354
00:26:07,260 --> 00:26:08,440
It's a dead rat.

355
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:12,840
It had been nesting above the warm light.

356
00:26:13,420 --> 00:26:15,900
And every time I used that light,
I was cooking it.

357
00:26:17,420 --> 00:26:19,000
But it was so gradual that...

358
00:26:20,580 --> 00:26:23,240
I couldn't even tell that I was breathing
in this...

359
00:26:23,241 --> 00:26:25,240
This rotting carcass every night.

360
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:29,440
I can't believe I haven't heard that story
before.

361
00:26:34,870 --> 00:26:39,630
I had forgotten all about it until the
night I found them.

362
00:26:42,770 --> 00:26:45,610
And there's this detail that I never told
you.

363
00:26:46,370 --> 00:26:50,130
But I never told anyone about the smell.

364
00:26:52,350 --> 00:26:53,490
But it was worse than that.

365
00:26:53,610 --> 00:26:55,190
It was like a, like a taste.

366
00:26:55,510 --> 00:26:57,390
Like the air was thick.

367
00:26:57,630 --> 00:27:01,390
And it just got worse the closer I got to
their bedroom.

368
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:07,060
Then I opened the door.

369
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,400
She was smiling at me.

370
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,180
She had woke to find her other half was
gone.

371
00:27:17,181 --> 00:27:19,180
And her brain just snapped.

372
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:20,880
She couldn't process it.

373
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:24,120
Still going to bed each night next to
that...

374
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:25,680
The face.

375
00:27:25,820 --> 00:27:27,340
The adorable smell.

376
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:31,000
I was standing there choking on the taste
of him.

377
00:27:31,140 --> 00:27:32,240
And she didn't even notice.

378
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:36,960
It's like me with the rat.

379
00:27:37,980 --> 00:27:40,320
Just breathing him in like fresh air.

380
00:27:47,620 --> 00:27:48,620
I'm sorry.

381
00:27:50,740 --> 00:27:54,620
It's like a window open between our house
and that night.

382
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,140
I'm sorry.

383
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:38,320
I'm sorry.

384
00:29:38,321 --> 00:29:45,010
What do you think?

385
00:29:46,430 --> 00:29:47,490
What?

386
00:29:47,550 --> 00:29:48,610
Oh...

387
00:29:51,780 --> 00:29:55,080
Oh... Only you could
sleep in in a wet cave.

388
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:56,540
Oh.

389
00:29:57,300 --> 00:29:59,000
What time is it?

390
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:01,100
Oh...

391
00:30:04,290 --> 00:30:05,830
That sucks.

392
00:30:06,810 --> 00:30:08,010
Let's just get home.

393
00:30:09,810 --> 00:30:11,730
But my demos were on there.

394
00:30:12,390 --> 00:30:13,390
I hate you.

395
00:30:14,130 --> 00:30:15,130
No, you don't.

396
00:30:20,940 --> 00:30:21,700
What are you doing?

397
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:23,100
Well, I'm not doing anything.

398
00:30:23,500 --> 00:30:24,500
What is that?

399
00:30:24,860 --> 00:30:26,180
Wait, stop, stop, stop.

400
00:30:29,540 --> 00:30:30,700
What the fuck?

401
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:32,520
What is it?

402
00:30:34,420 --> 00:30:35,420
Mildew or something.

403
00:30:36,460 --> 00:30:36,800
Ow.

404
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:38,040
Ow, that heart.

405
00:30:38,060 --> 00:30:38,540
I know.

406
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:39,140
What do you want to do?

407
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:39,600
A fucking test?

408
00:30:39,601 --> 00:30:40,601
A three-legged race?

409
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:46,000
Sorry, I... Slow, slow.

410
00:31:17,430 --> 00:31:18,430
Oh,

411
00:31:25,020 --> 00:31:26,680
you're pretty impressive in there.

412
00:31:28,340 --> 00:31:29,720
Remember when I found North?

413
00:31:51,540 --> 00:31:53,120
We should head into town.

414
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:54,480
There's no food in the house.

415
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:56,540
There used to be rice.

416
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:59,540
Oh, we haven't exactly budgeted for two
new phones.

417
00:32:02,780 --> 00:32:04,701
But first... What?

418
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:06,040
Just two minutes.

419
00:32:06,380 --> 00:32:06,500
Babe.

420
00:32:07,020 --> 00:32:07,520
Come on.

421
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:09,016
I just spent the night in a cave.

422
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:09,460
Okay.

423
00:32:09,820 --> 00:32:11,000
Please, please, please.

424
00:32:11,180 --> 00:32:12,180
Fine.

425
00:32:12,280 --> 00:32:13,500
All right, but you do me next.

426
00:32:13,740 --> 00:32:14,740
Mm-hmm.

427
00:32:17,340 --> 00:32:18,340
Babe, come on.

428
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:26,680
Babe.

429
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:13,660
Tim.

430
00:33:14,020 --> 00:33:14,480
Tim?

431
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:14,720
Tim?

432
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:15,100
Tim?

433
00:33:15,101 --> 00:33:15,140
Ah!

434
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:15,720
What?

435
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:17,240
What the fuck?

436
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:18,760
I'm sorry.

437
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:19,420
Oh.

438
00:33:20,140 --> 00:33:21,140
Trying to be funny?

439
00:33:21,340 --> 00:33:22,340
That really hurt.

440
00:33:24,520 --> 00:33:25,920
Honey, you don't look so good.

441
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:28,860
I'm just really tired.

442
00:33:32,180 --> 00:33:33,480
I'm gonna head into town.

443
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:34,720
I can come.

444
00:33:35,020 --> 00:33:36,020
No, you just relax.

445
00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:37,780
And maybe take a shower, yeah?

446
00:35:30,260 --> 00:35:31,260
You

447
00:35:45,850 --> 00:35:47,710
dealt with anxiety, panic attacks.

448
00:35:48,050 --> 00:35:49,450
It's possible this is one of those?

449
00:35:50,010 --> 00:35:51,730
No, I don't think so.

450
00:35:52,070 --> 00:35:53,070
How old are you?

451
00:35:54,670 --> 00:35:55,790
We're actually the same age.

452
00:35:56,730 --> 00:35:58,890
See, there's a history of mental illness
in the family.

453
00:35:59,010 --> 00:36:00,830
Your mother... No,
it's nothing like that.

454
00:36:00,970 --> 00:36:01,970
This is different.

455
00:36:02,430 --> 00:36:04,190
I think it's worth discussing what
happened to her.

456
00:36:04,191 --> 00:36:05,506
I've had this conversation before.

457
00:36:05,530 --> 00:36:06,530
I'm not her.

458
00:36:08,910 --> 00:36:10,030
You have someone to talk to.

459
00:36:10,830 --> 00:36:12,370
Family, a therapist, friends.

460
00:36:12,750 --> 00:36:14,510
Yeah, I got friends back in the city.

461
00:36:14,950 --> 00:36:16,230
So locally, it's just your wife?

462
00:36:16,670 --> 00:36:17,170
Partner.

463
00:36:17,450 --> 00:36:18,450
Yeah, it's just her.

464
00:36:20,370 --> 00:36:21,990
You had this dangerous experience.

465
00:36:22,610 --> 00:36:24,209
When you're left alone
in an unfamiliar place,

466
00:36:24,210 --> 00:36:26,851
no one to help if
something were to go wrong.

467
00:36:27,090 --> 00:36:30,650
Anxiety can fixate on a thought like that
and spiral into a physical panic response.

468
00:36:31,510 --> 00:36:34,447
This is technically a
muscle relaxant, meaning

469
00:36:34,448 --> 00:36:37,351
it slows the central
nervous system down.

470
00:36:37,810 --> 00:36:40,381
So even if your brain
starts panicking, your

471
00:36:40,382 --> 00:36:42,610
body relaxes, shutting
down the feedback loop.

472
00:36:42,910 --> 00:36:43,390
Okay?

473
00:36:43,690 --> 00:36:44,690
Yeah.

474
00:36:46,110 --> 00:36:47,270
You know, you two were lucky.

475
00:36:47,650 --> 00:36:49,630
It was that couple that went missing out
there.

476
00:36:50,710 --> 00:36:51,090
What?

477
00:36:51,230 --> 00:36:52,230
When?

478
00:36:52,290 --> 00:36:53,390
There's still posters up.

479
00:36:53,890 --> 00:36:55,670
Biggest news this sound scene for a while.

480
00:36:56,630 --> 00:36:58,590
Bigger than local man water his garden.

481
00:36:58,890 --> 00:36:59,890
I'm serious.

482
00:37:00,070 --> 00:37:01,470
It was a big search and everything.

483
00:37:04,030 --> 00:37:05,030
The Valium?

484
00:37:05,530 --> 00:37:06,970
It's called diazepam now.

485
00:37:41,980 --> 00:37:42,980
All ready for tomorrow?

486
00:37:43,660 --> 00:37:44,660
Huh?

487
00:37:45,180 --> 00:37:47,500
Honey, if you're not feeling well,
maybe you should cancel.

488
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:49,760
Hey, if I cancel, I can forget about the
tour.

489
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:54,020
Hey, we didn't get much data, yeah?

490
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:56,640
Maybe don't use it
all... What are you...

491
00:37:57,140 --> 00:37:58,860
Cruising for chicks online?

492
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:01,420
You know, people went missing around here
recently.

493
00:38:02,100 --> 00:38:02,400
Really?

494
00:38:02,940 --> 00:38:03,940
Yeah.

495
00:38:04,060 --> 00:38:05,380
Hey, do me a favor when I die.

496
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:09,320
Please just nuke any and all of my social
media from existence.

497
00:38:09,321 --> 00:38:11,749
I don't want to be
remembered for posting nature

498
00:38:11,750 --> 00:38:14,841
is what home feels
like and getting 23 likes.

499
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:17,440
They post this and that's it.

500
00:38:18,060 --> 00:38:18,560
Cool.

501
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:19,840
Great life.

502
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:24,060
Okay, so if you die tonight, what's your
final post?

503
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:27,100
You took the plunge.

504
00:38:27,560 --> 00:38:27,580
You took the plunge.

505
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:27,800
Aww.

506
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:30,060
That is so fucking basic.

507
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:32,020
Why would you tag me in that?

508
00:38:32,180 --> 00:38:34,220
Because all this shit is basic,
Tim.

509
00:38:34,380 --> 00:38:35,380
Nobody cares.

510
00:38:35,460 --> 00:38:36,780
It's just a like my mom can see.

511
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:38,780
Plus, you love it.

512
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:40,920
Whatever.

513
00:38:43,300 --> 00:38:45,140
That'd be a sad one to end it on,
though.

514
00:38:45,740 --> 00:38:46,740
Yeah.

515
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:48,360
What wouldn't be?

516
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:50,920
BRB?

517
00:38:51,180 --> 00:38:52,180
Dying.

518
00:38:58,340 --> 00:38:59,860
Literally, who could that be?

519
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:03,160
Hi.

520
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:04,040
Hello!

521
00:39:04,540 --> 00:39:05,720
I hope you don't mind.

522
00:39:05,721 --> 00:39:09,480
I was in the neighborhood and,
uh, because I am the neighborhood.

523
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:14,560
Uh, and I thought I would officially
welcome you to said neighborhood.

524
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:15,440
Hey.

525
00:39:15,780 --> 00:39:16,440
Hey, man.

526
00:39:16,780 --> 00:39:17,360
Oh, babe.

527
00:39:17,540 --> 00:39:18,680
This is Mr. McCabe.

528
00:39:18,900 --> 00:39:20,400
Jamie, who I told you I am.

529
00:39:20,500 --> 00:39:20,700
Right.

530
00:39:20,820 --> 00:39:21,080
Oh, yeah.

531
00:39:21,180 --> 00:39:21,400
Hey.

532
00:39:21,580 --> 00:39:23,320
You must be Tim, the boy partner.

533
00:39:23,860 --> 00:39:24,860
Nice to meet you.

534
00:39:26,020 --> 00:39:27,380
I'm hoping you drink red.

535
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:28,800
Oh, Tim drinks anything.

536
00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:30,080
Please come in.

537
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:30,780
Oh, no, no.

538
00:39:30,860 --> 00:39:31,620
I don't want to intrude.

539
00:39:31,621 --> 00:39:32,621
Mr. McCabe.

540
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:34,360
I insist you intrude.

541
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:37,440
Alright.

542
00:39:38,100 --> 00:39:39,100
Thanks.

543
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:40,200
Here, just to the left.

544
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:42,680
Mr. McCabe.

545
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:44,800
That's terrifying.

546
00:39:45,100 --> 00:39:46,380
Well, it was more just the rain.

547
00:39:46,540 --> 00:39:47,600
It was pouring rain.

548
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:47,820
Right.

549
00:39:47,821 --> 00:39:49,300
I mean, we were totally disoriented.

550
00:39:49,640 --> 00:39:51,240
Well, you know your phone has a compass.

551
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:52,200
Yeah.

552
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:55,680
Alright, let's not get stuck on who had
which cardinal directions.

553
00:39:58,700 --> 00:40:01,336
Seriously, though, have you ever seen
anything like that out there?

554
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:03,200
I was getting, like, cult vibes.

555
00:40:04,140 --> 00:40:04,900
Cult vibes?

556
00:40:05,020 --> 00:40:06,280
Honey, I don't know about that.

557
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:07,880
Well, were we not in the same place?

558
00:40:08,260 --> 00:40:12,940
It was a cave, but there was, like,
a giant bell and church pews in the walls.

559
00:40:12,980 --> 00:40:13,980
It was fucking weird.

560
00:40:14,540 --> 00:40:17,440
There was a chapel out that way.

561
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:17,800
Okay.

562
00:40:17,980 --> 00:40:19,740
But that collapsed years ago.

563
00:40:20,500 --> 00:40:21,780
It was just, like, in the middle of
nowhere?

564
00:40:21,781 --> 00:40:25,160
Yeah, it was, like, this new-agey,
hippy-dippy group.

565
00:40:26,220 --> 00:40:27,220
Cold vibes.

566
00:40:27,660 --> 00:40:28,660
What happened to them?

567
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:30,400
Mass suicide.

568
00:40:31,980 --> 00:40:32,380
No.

569
00:40:32,580 --> 00:40:33,580
Oh, God!

570
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:34,400
No.

571
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:35,920
Uh, I don't know.

572
00:40:35,980 --> 00:40:38,140
They just kind of, I don't know,
thinned out over time.

573
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:40,440
I think they moved on when the weather
took the building.

574
00:40:40,580 --> 00:40:45,201
Hard to recruit new members when your house
of worship becomes a subterranean lair.

575
00:40:47,020 --> 00:40:48,020
I got it.

576
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:50,940
Thanks, honey.

577
00:40:50,941 --> 00:40:51,941
Yeah.

578
00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:54,980
Man, this food.

579
00:40:55,540 --> 00:40:57,180
I might make a habit of dropping by.

580
00:40:57,720 --> 00:40:58,720
It's all Tim.

581
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:01,720
I can't cook to save my life, and it's his
fault.

582
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:03,440
No, it's my fault.

583
00:41:03,640 --> 00:41:05,760
You're so good at this stuff, I've never
had to learn.

584
00:41:06,220 --> 00:41:08,076
So if it weren't for me, you'd know how to
cook?

585
00:41:08,100 --> 00:41:09,829
And if it weren't for
me, you wouldn't be the

586
00:41:09,830 --> 00:41:11,560
only 30-something
without a driver's license.

587
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:12,880
Well, I have a license.

588
00:41:12,881 --> 00:41:15,240
He doesn't have, he has a learner's
permit.

589
00:41:15,241 --> 00:41:17,300
He can't actually drive a car.

590
00:41:17,301 --> 00:41:18,660
It's a good deal, you know?

591
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:20,680
She gets a personal cook and I'm trapped
here.

592
00:41:21,560 --> 00:41:21,960
Trapped?

593
00:41:22,340 --> 00:41:25,200
I can't even make it to the train station
unless it fits your schedule.

594
00:41:25,460 --> 00:41:27,220
And nobody's holding you hostage,
Tim.

595
00:41:27,221 --> 00:41:29,221
And now hostages don't have to cook their
own food.

596
00:41:33,570 --> 00:41:36,570
Well, it sounds to me like you complete
each other.

597
00:41:41,340 --> 00:41:41,760
Think?

598
00:41:42,040 --> 00:41:43,800
I mean, that's what
I... It's so weird.

599
00:41:44,340 --> 00:41:45,461
It's... yeah.

600
00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:47,680
Hey, it was nice to meet you, man.

601
00:41:47,740 --> 00:41:49,000
Hey, you too, thanks again.

602
00:41:49,320 --> 00:41:50,140
And I'll see you tomorrow.

603
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:51,980
Yes, oh, yeah, oh.

604
00:41:52,080 --> 00:41:53,080
Okay, bye.

605
00:41:54,040 --> 00:41:55,040
Bye.

606
00:41:59,420 --> 00:42:00,420
He's friendly.

607
00:42:01,780 --> 00:42:02,200
What?

608
00:42:02,201 --> 00:42:04,880
No, I just, I think he likes you.

609
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:05,780
No, he doesn't.

610
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:06,920
Don't be weird.

611
00:42:07,160 --> 00:42:08,160
Mm-hmm.

612
00:42:08,540 --> 00:42:10,060
You seem pretty charmed by him,
too.

613
00:42:11,420 --> 00:42:12,420
Really?

614
00:42:15,460 --> 00:42:16,460
Yeah, you're right.

615
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:17,940
I might just fall on.

616
00:42:17,980 --> 00:42:18,980
Yeah.

617
00:42:45,970 --> 00:42:46,410
Ow!

618
00:42:46,870 --> 00:42:48,050
Did you just bite me?

619
00:42:49,130 --> 00:42:49,530
No.

620
00:42:49,990 --> 00:42:51,790
What is this?

621
00:42:51,850 --> 00:42:54,530
You're all over me one minute,
and then the next... I didn't.

622
00:42:54,710 --> 00:42:56,350
I just, I...

623
00:42:57,570 --> 00:42:58,570
Something's off.

624
00:42:58,890 --> 00:43:01,891
Ever since we've been here,
I just... Stop with the excuses.

625
00:43:02,490 --> 00:43:02,890
Excuses?

626
00:43:02,970 --> 00:43:04,290
I'm not making this up, babe.

627
00:43:04,710 --> 00:43:07,190
Tim, if you don't want to fuck me,
Tim, just say it.

628
00:44:07,130 --> 00:44:08,130
Mm.

629
00:44:09,770 --> 00:44:10,770
Mm.

630
00:44:11,190 --> 00:44:12,210
You're on my hair.

631
00:44:16,430 --> 00:44:18,610
Roll over, then you're on my hair.

632
00:44:24,920 --> 00:44:25,700
Tim.

633
00:44:25,701 --> 00:44:36,190
A little pause.

634
00:44:57,590 --> 00:44:57,240
..

635
00:45:43,960 --> 00:45:44,960
You ready?

636
00:45:46,200 --> 00:45:47,320
I don't think you should go.

637
00:45:48,020 --> 00:45:49,020
There's a surprise.

638
00:45:50,460 --> 00:45:52,400
Are we really not going to talk about last
night?

639
00:45:52,540 --> 00:45:53,060
Your acting?

640
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:53,520
What, crazy?

641
00:45:53,740 --> 00:45:54,780
That's not what I was saying.

642
00:45:54,781 --> 00:45:55,440
I was unconscious, okay?

643
00:45:55,441 --> 00:45:56,536
I didn't know what I was doing.

644
00:45:56,560 --> 00:45:58,040
If you're sick, you should stay home.

645
00:45:58,120 --> 00:45:58,220
Yeah, come on.

646
00:45:58,340 --> 00:45:59,340
I can't miss the train.

647
00:46:01,480 --> 00:46:02,480
Please.

648
00:46:19,650 --> 00:46:20,690
You're going to be great.

649
00:46:21,790 --> 00:46:24,010
You know, I'd drive you the whole way if I
could.

650
00:46:24,950 --> 00:46:25,950
It's fine.

651
00:46:29,620 --> 00:46:31,300
Don't worry about coming back here
tonight.

652
00:46:32,980 --> 00:46:33,980
You mad at me?

653
00:46:34,380 --> 00:46:35,400
No, no, no, no, no.

654
00:46:35,500 --> 00:46:37,020
I just mean stay out.

655
00:46:37,900 --> 00:46:42,301
Enjoy the after party, you know, sleep at
Luke's and actually catch up with everyone.

656
00:46:42,840 --> 00:46:44,580
No use coming back here and feeling
trapped.

657
00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:47,080
I didn't mean that.

658
00:46:47,340 --> 00:46:50,480
Sure, but maybe some space would be good.

659
00:46:52,060 --> 00:46:53,060
Are you sure?

660
00:46:54,080 --> 00:46:55,080
Escape!

661
00:46:55,200 --> 00:46:56,200
Be free!

662
00:46:57,500 --> 00:46:58,500
Okay.

663
00:46:58,700 --> 00:46:59,700
Yeah, you're right.

664
00:46:59,920 --> 00:47:00,920
Thanks.

665
00:47:28,430 --> 00:47:30,090
No, no, no, no.

666
00:48:06,410 --> 00:48:07,410
All right.

667
00:48:08,210 --> 00:48:09,350
Great work, team.

668
00:48:09,850 --> 00:48:11,110
I'll see you after P.E.

669
00:48:17,330 --> 00:48:20,530
Anna, Mr. Richardson won't like it if
you're late.

670
00:48:21,050 --> 00:48:22,050
Sorry, miss.

671
00:48:34,660 --> 00:48:35,940
Are these your dogs?

672
00:48:37,800 --> 00:48:38,800
None anymore.

673
00:49:04,900 --> 00:49:05,700
I don't know.

674
00:49:05,900 --> 00:49:08,580
I, you know, honestly, it's been hard.

675
00:49:09,960 --> 00:49:10,960
Are you okay?

676
00:49:11,860 --> 00:49:13,760
Like, do you need me to come up there?

677
00:49:14,040 --> 00:49:15,060
I, fuck it.

678
00:49:15,320 --> 00:49:16,100
I'm coming up there.

679
00:49:16,160 --> 00:49:17,160
No, no, no, no, no, no.

680
00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:19,000
I'm probably making it sound worse than it
is.

681
00:49:19,160 --> 00:49:21,320
And anyway, my folks are coming up for
lunch on Sunday.

682
00:49:21,460 --> 00:49:24,080
So, yeah, he probably just needs to see a
familiar face.

683
00:49:24,720 --> 00:49:26,840
Yeah, I just want to make sure you're
okay.

684
00:49:27,200 --> 00:49:27,780
I'm fine.

685
00:49:28,140 --> 00:49:29,540
I like the quiet country life.

686
00:49:29,700 --> 00:49:30,700
I'm the boring one.

687
00:49:31,060 --> 00:49:32,060
Yeah.

688
00:49:32,140 --> 00:49:34,020
You think you're boring because what?

689
00:49:34,160 --> 00:49:35,580
You have an actual proper job?

690
00:49:36,360 --> 00:49:37,360
I loved him.

691
00:49:37,880 --> 00:49:41,700
But he is a 35-year-old white guy who
still thinks he's going to be a rock star.

692
00:49:41,980 --> 00:49:43,100
That is fucking boring.

693
00:49:43,101 --> 00:49:44,340
He's a good guy.

694
00:49:45,340 --> 00:49:46,340
Is he?

695
00:49:46,700 --> 00:49:47,700
Yes.

696
00:49:48,580 --> 00:49:50,640
You know, I always think about our first
date.

697
00:49:50,860 --> 00:49:53,140
I said my favorite band was the Spice
Girls.

698
00:49:53,400 --> 00:49:55,900
I didn't realize he was like this music
snob guy.

699
00:49:56,140 --> 00:50:00,320
And then he shows up on our second date
with Spice on vinyl.

700
00:50:00,540 --> 00:50:01,540
That is sweet.

701
00:50:01,920 --> 00:50:04,500
But that was nearly a decade ago.

702
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:06,180
What has he done lately?

703
00:50:14,910 --> 00:50:15,910
I gonna go.

704
00:50:15,990 --> 00:50:16,990
Why?

705
00:50:24,910 --> 00:50:26,570
No, no, no, no, no.

706
00:50:26,930 --> 00:50:27,930
No!

707
00:50:34,070 --> 00:50:35,290
Where were you doing?

708
00:50:35,810 --> 00:50:37,450
Yes, I need to see you.

709
00:50:37,590 --> 00:50:38,606
Why aren't you on the train?

710
00:50:38,630 --> 00:50:40,090
This is really fucking weird, Tim.

711
00:50:41,010 --> 00:50:44,110
It's like I'm thirsty all over,
but not now.

712
00:50:44,770 --> 00:50:45,770
And not with you.

713
00:50:46,050 --> 00:50:53,500
Me too.

714
00:51:55,900 --> 00:51:57,020
What are we doing?

715
00:51:57,840 --> 00:52:00,740
I'm sorry, I just... I had a feeling.

716
00:52:00,900 --> 00:52:01,900
I don't apologize.

717
00:52:02,600 --> 00:52:04,420
Let's just try it at home next week.

718
00:52:05,060 --> 00:52:06,060
Or maybe don't.

719
00:52:06,360 --> 00:52:06,760
So long.

720
00:52:07,240 --> 00:52:08,240
Okay.

721
00:52:08,280 --> 00:52:09,280
Okay.

722
00:52:09,880 --> 00:52:11,300
Now you gotta get out of here.

723
00:52:16,130 --> 00:52:17,530
What are you doing?

724
00:52:18,050 --> 00:52:19,050
What do you mean?

725
00:52:19,250 --> 00:52:21,790
It's... why... why are you, like,
tensing?

726
00:52:22,230 --> 00:52:22,450
What?

727
00:52:23,010 --> 00:52:24,010
I...

728
00:52:25,070 --> 00:52:27,330
Babe, it's... wait, I'm stuck.

729
00:52:28,790 --> 00:52:29,310
Ow.

730
00:52:29,630 --> 00:52:30,130
It hurts.

731
00:52:30,290 --> 00:52:31,290
I know, I know.

732
00:52:59,440 --> 00:53:00,480
It hurt.

733
00:53:00,720 --> 00:53:01,720
It hurt.

734
00:53:05,430 --> 00:53:06,430
Get out of here now.

735
00:53:06,570 --> 00:53:07,210
I'm trying.

736
00:53:07,470 --> 00:53:08,790
It's not fucking moving.

737
00:53:10,470 --> 00:53:11,470
That hurts.

738
00:53:18,950 --> 00:53:19,690
Thank you.

739
00:53:19,910 --> 00:53:20,470
Listen to me.

740
00:53:20,610 --> 00:53:21,070
Listen to me.

741
00:53:21,530 --> 00:53:22,530
I'm sorry.

742
00:53:55,330 --> 00:53:56,550
Everything okay in there?

743
00:54:00,460 --> 00:54:01,640
Just a sec.

744
00:54:23,370 --> 00:54:24,830
Everything okay, Miss Wilson?

745
00:54:28,130 --> 00:54:29,130
Sorry.

746
00:54:29,430 --> 00:54:31,490
I had to, uh...

747
00:54:35,370 --> 00:54:36,370
Miss Wilson.

748
00:54:36,830 --> 00:54:38,690
You know this is, uh...

749
00:54:39,470 --> 00:54:40,910
A bathroom for little boys.

750
00:54:44,820 --> 00:54:45,820
Sorry.

751
00:54:45,960 --> 00:54:47,240
I, uh...

752
00:54:48,380 --> 00:54:49,380
Had to...

753
00:54:51,920 --> 00:54:52,920
Go to class.

754
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:54,000
Everything's fine.

755
00:55:01,530 --> 00:55:04,650
Next time, try to... Get
to the staff bathroom.

756
00:55:04,950 --> 00:55:05,950
Yeah.

757
00:55:10,080 --> 00:55:14,041
And you might
wanna, uh... Clean up.

758
00:55:17,690 --> 00:55:18,690
Shit.

759
00:55:31,820 --> 00:55:32,820
Babe.

760
00:55:33,320 --> 00:55:33,920
Babe, come on.

761
00:55:33,980 --> 00:55:34,960
We're just not gonna talk about this?

762
00:55:34,961 --> 00:55:35,300
Do you...

763
00:55:35,960 --> 00:55:37,520
Understand what you did today?

764
00:55:37,800 --> 00:55:39,040
I could've been fired.

765
00:55:39,260 --> 00:55:41,661
Or worse, like... Like...

766
00:55:41,880 --> 00:55:42,400
Arrested worse.

767
00:55:42,500 --> 00:55:44,060
Wait, I didn't make you do anything.

768
00:55:44,600 --> 00:55:47,800
You don't fuck me for months, then you barge
into my work with that I need you shit?

769
00:55:47,900 --> 00:55:48,960
Yeah, you kinda did.

770
00:55:50,220 --> 00:55:52,140
God... Are you trying
to ruin this for me?

771
00:55:52,520 --> 00:55:54,580
You know, I have sat on the sidelines.

772
00:55:54,581 --> 00:55:57,422
I have sacrificed so
that you've had space to

773
00:55:57,423 --> 00:55:59,960
try to make your impossible
dreams come true.

774
00:56:00,120 --> 00:56:02,500
Whoa, I'm not gonna apologize for taking
some risks.

775
00:56:02,501 --> 00:56:05,000
And I never can because you use all the
risk up.

776
00:56:05,200 --> 00:56:06,980
I moved here for you.

777
00:56:07,080 --> 00:56:08,200
I left my whole life behind.

778
00:56:08,280 --> 00:56:09,280
What life?

779
00:56:09,420 --> 00:56:10,520
God, your music?

780
00:56:10,720 --> 00:56:12,040
Then why aren't you at your show?

781
00:56:12,140 --> 00:56:15,340
Tim, if you think I've trapped you,
why don't you fucking leave?

782
00:56:20,380 --> 00:56:21,380
I can't.

783
00:56:22,380 --> 00:56:23,920
I don't think I'm okay.

784
00:56:24,380 --> 00:56:25,380
It's like...

785
00:56:25,520 --> 00:56:27,460
My brain and my body aren't talking.

786
00:56:27,520 --> 00:56:28,520
You don't understand.

787
00:56:29,220 --> 00:56:30,820
I guess I don't.

788
00:56:36,610 --> 00:56:37,790
Wait, where are you going?

789
00:56:38,690 --> 00:56:39,810
To clean up your mess?

790
00:56:39,990 --> 00:56:40,990
Sounds familiar?

791
00:56:41,570 --> 00:56:42,570
Do you want me to come?

792
00:56:43,290 --> 00:56:44,290
What do you want, Tim?

793
00:56:45,150 --> 00:56:46,566
I can't make every decision for you.

794
00:56:46,590 --> 00:56:47,606
I'm not your fucking mother.

795
00:56:47,630 --> 00:56:49,150
Even if I'm starting to feel like her.

796
00:56:49,570 --> 00:56:50,730
What's that supposed to mean?

797
00:56:50,890 --> 00:56:52,590
Like I'm living with something that's
dead.

798
00:57:23,710 --> 00:57:24,110
Millie?

799
00:57:24,270 --> 00:57:25,270
Hi.

800
00:57:26,570 --> 00:57:27,990
The yellow house on the corner.

801
00:57:28,390 --> 00:57:28,790
Yeah.

802
00:57:28,791 --> 00:57:29,791
Yeah.

803
00:57:32,490 --> 00:57:37,000
So... Today... I just
wanted to apologize again...

804
00:57:38,870 --> 00:57:39,870
For...

805
00:57:40,460 --> 00:57:45,210
I'm... So embarrassed...
About, um...

806
00:57:45,790 --> 00:57:46,890
Oh, that!

807
00:57:47,150 --> 00:57:48,150
Oh, no.

808
00:57:48,680 --> 00:57:49,870
Don't even mention it.

809
00:57:50,350 --> 00:57:51,350
That's...

810
00:57:52,670 --> 00:57:54,570
Female... Issues.

811
00:57:54,571 --> 00:57:56,490
It's, uh... Please don't... No.

812
00:57:56,990 --> 00:57:57,990
Say no more, please.

813
00:57:59,450 --> 00:58:00,450
Thanks.

814
00:58:00,730 --> 00:58:01,210
Hey!

815
00:58:01,490 --> 00:58:02,490
What's wrong?

816
00:58:05,650 --> 00:58:08,470
Sorry, um... It's just
been a really stressful day.

817
00:58:09,470 --> 00:58:11,070
Tim and I just had a big fight.

818
00:58:11,770 --> 00:58:12,170
Sorry.

819
00:58:12,171 --> 00:58:13,690
This is not your problem.

820
00:58:14,990 --> 00:58:15,990
Wanna come inside?

821
00:58:16,970 --> 00:58:18,070
I don't wanna intrude.

822
00:58:18,410 --> 00:58:19,590
Miss Wilson...

823
00:58:20,070 --> 00:58:21,570
I insist you intrude.

824
00:58:22,770 --> 00:58:24,250
I'll get you a glass of water.

825
00:58:33,820 --> 00:58:37,060
You sure I can't tempt you with anything
stiffer?

826
00:58:37,700 --> 00:58:38,700
Uh, no.

827
00:58:38,840 --> 00:58:40,140
Water's fine, thanks.

828
00:58:42,980 --> 00:58:44,180
What's going on?

829
00:58:45,720 --> 00:58:47,241
Uh... I don't know.

830
00:58:48,440 --> 00:58:50,540
I keep thinking this was a mistake.

831
00:58:52,660 --> 00:58:57,140
Like... Since the move, Tim and
I haven't been on the same page.

832
00:58:58,620 --> 00:59:01,820
But then... Maybe we haven't
been on the same page for a while.

833
00:59:02,100 --> 00:59:03,580
And we're just...

834
00:59:04,220 --> 00:59:06,000
Too scared to admit it.

835
00:59:07,500 --> 00:59:09,180
Do you, uh...

836
00:59:11,380 --> 00:59:12,700
Do you love each other?

837
00:59:13,740 --> 00:59:14,740
Yeah.

838
00:59:15,640 --> 00:59:16,800
Of course.

839
00:59:17,260 --> 00:59:18,040
Right?

840
00:59:18,280 --> 00:59:19,280
But...

841
00:59:19,700 --> 00:59:22,000
I mean, I don't remember life before Tim.

842
00:59:22,880 --> 00:59:26,501
So... Maybe we're
just... Complacent.

843
00:59:27,520 --> 00:59:31,960
Well, you know, complacency can sometimes
simply be harmony.

844
00:59:33,680 --> 00:59:37,580
Do you wanna... Here's something
I teach my ninth grade history class.

845
00:59:38,300 --> 00:59:39,300
Desperately.

846
00:59:40,980 --> 00:59:46,600
Plato wrote that the ancient Greeks
believed we were created with four arms,

847
00:59:46,860 --> 00:59:49,420
four legs, and a head with two faces.

848
00:59:49,960 --> 00:59:56,540
But, uh, Zeus feared our power,
so he split us into two separate parts.

849
00:59:57,260 --> 01:00:01,680
Dooming us to spend our lives in search of
the other half.

850
01:00:03,680 --> 01:00:07,500
If you think you've found that,
don't be so quick to let it go.

851
01:00:09,380 --> 01:00:10,780
Well, if Plato says so.

852
01:00:15,190 --> 01:00:16,430
Is it just you here?

853
01:00:17,750 --> 01:00:19,850
Sorry, that's... it's none of my business.

854
01:00:19,851 --> 01:00:21,930
Oh, no, please, God, I'm the one prying.

855
01:00:22,950 --> 01:00:26,910
Uh, yeah, there were two of us when we
first bought this place.

856
01:00:28,070 --> 01:00:32,330
Uh, and we were probably, you know,
around the same age as you guys.

857
01:00:32,510 --> 01:00:36,110
Probably had the same issues, same fights.

858
01:00:38,270 --> 01:00:42,470
And there was a brief time where I
actually did walk away.

859
01:00:44,310 --> 01:00:46,390
And it was liberating.

860
01:00:46,650 --> 01:00:49,990
I had the freedom to do whatever I wanted.

861
01:00:50,890 --> 01:00:52,170
So what did you do?

862
01:00:53,070 --> 01:00:54,210
Oh, nothing.

863
01:00:55,230 --> 01:00:56,610
I was miserable.

864
01:00:57,270 --> 01:01:01,550
Yeah, I just didn't know how to exist on
my own.

865
01:01:03,130 --> 01:01:05,490
I even started to miss the fights we had.

866
01:01:06,610 --> 01:01:13,370
Yeah, for better or worse, I was me
because of him.

867
01:01:17,800 --> 01:01:19,160
I bet you miss him.

868
01:01:26,540 --> 01:01:34,540
You know, I have a tape of my wedding that
I have been looking for an excuse to...

869
01:01:34,541 --> 01:01:40,080
Uh, you know, that sounds great,
but I should head back.

870
01:01:40,600 --> 01:01:41,600
Thanks.

871
01:01:42,160 --> 01:01:43,160
Next time.

872
01:01:48,240 --> 01:01:49,240
Sorry.

873
01:01:50,940 --> 01:01:52,660
Sorry, okay, I didn't know where else to
go.

874
01:02:33,060 --> 01:02:34,340
Babe, you ready for bed?

875
01:02:41,990 --> 01:02:42,990
Babe?

876
01:03:03,630 --> 01:03:04,630
Are you asleep?

877
01:03:10,190 --> 01:03:11,190
I'm sorry.

878
01:03:11,450 --> 01:03:14,230
I wish I could be what either of us wants
me to be.

879
01:05:08,800 --> 01:05:09,800
Mill?

880
01:06:08,150 --> 01:06:09,350
Oh shit.

881
01:06:09,630 --> 01:06:10,630
Babe!

882
01:06:11,170 --> 01:06:12,290
Baby, baby, wake up.

883
01:06:12,390 --> 01:06:12,730
Wake up.

884
01:06:12,930 --> 01:06:13,930
Millie, wake up!

885
01:06:16,250 --> 01:06:17,250
Baby!

886
01:06:26,070 --> 01:06:27,070
What are you doing?

887
01:06:28,190 --> 01:06:29,250
What am I doing?

888
01:06:32,710 --> 01:06:34,530
Maybe it was like a seizure.

889
01:06:34,870 --> 01:06:35,550
A seizure?

890
01:06:35,690 --> 01:06:37,010
Since when have you had seizures?

891
01:06:37,150 --> 01:06:38,070
Or sleepwalked?

892
01:06:38,071 --> 01:06:40,990
It's probably stress and you're not
helping.

893
01:06:41,810 --> 01:06:44,190
Look, I think something happened to me in
the cave.

894
01:06:44,430 --> 01:06:46,370
Something that's making me act insane.

895
01:06:46,730 --> 01:06:49,510
And now it's like... it's like it's in you
too.

896
01:06:52,010 --> 01:06:54,301
Alright, that missing
couple, those hikers, they

897
01:06:54,302 --> 01:06:56,571
were on the same path
that took us to the cave.

898
01:06:56,630 --> 01:06:58,710
What if whatever happened to them is
happening to us?

899
01:06:58,930 --> 01:07:00,090
I feel fine.

900
01:07:00,350 --> 01:07:01,626
But that's because you're awake.

901
01:07:01,650 --> 01:07:03,150
You're adrenalized, okay?

902
01:07:03,250 --> 01:07:04,910
I think it gets worse at night.

903
01:07:05,050 --> 01:07:07,590
It's like when the mind gets tired,
the body can take over.

904
01:07:08,970 --> 01:07:10,130
Listen to what you're saying.

905
01:07:11,870 --> 01:07:14,030
Alright, remember that morning our legs
stuck together?

906
01:07:14,750 --> 01:07:16,350
You said that was just mildew.

907
01:07:16,570 --> 01:07:18,350
Since when do I know anything about
mildew?

908
01:07:18,430 --> 01:07:19,910
I don't even know what it fucking is!

909
01:07:21,270 --> 01:07:23,350
After we had sex, we couldn't separate.

910
01:07:23,530 --> 01:07:24,530
Explain that.

911
01:07:24,770 --> 01:07:25,770
It had been a while.

912
01:07:25,850 --> 01:07:27,370
That always makes it a little painful.

913
01:07:27,670 --> 01:07:28,670
Pain.

914
01:07:31,150 --> 01:07:32,990
Okay, alright, put your hand up like this.

915
01:07:33,250 --> 01:07:34,250
Try not to touch mine.

916
01:07:34,630 --> 01:07:35,930
You'll feel it, babe, please.

917
01:07:37,770 --> 01:07:38,770
This is ridiculous.

918
01:07:39,150 --> 01:07:39,810
I'm going to bed.

919
01:07:39,990 --> 01:07:42,530
Come on, it's like we're magnetic,
babe, please.

920
01:07:42,990 --> 01:07:44,990
I think you should sleep in the spare room
tonight.

921
01:07:45,370 --> 01:07:45,890
I agree.

922
01:07:45,891 --> 01:07:47,090
We need to keep our distance.

923
01:07:50,370 --> 01:07:51,370
Babe, wait.

924
01:07:59,750 --> 01:08:01,010
I know why you stopped.

925
01:08:01,550 --> 01:08:03,810
Because the moment you got there,
I wanted you to stop.

926
01:08:03,950 --> 01:08:04,950
I felt it.

927
01:08:06,690 --> 01:08:07,690
That's not...

928
01:08:08,170 --> 01:08:10,190
It's... That doesn't
make any sense.

929
01:08:10,670 --> 01:08:12,590
Then how come I know exactly what you're
feeling?

930
01:08:13,330 --> 01:08:14,330
The pull?

931
01:08:14,490 --> 01:08:16,650
The thirst in your bones?

932
01:08:17,070 --> 01:08:19,870
Babe, something inside us has imprinted on
each other.

933
01:08:20,730 --> 01:08:21,990
We're sick, okay?

934
01:08:22,230 --> 01:08:24,330
I can't explain it, but it's that place.

935
01:08:24,510 --> 01:08:25,290
It has to be.

936
01:08:25,410 --> 01:08:26,750
Tim... We need answers.

937
01:08:27,090 --> 01:08:28,090
I'm gonna go back.

938
01:08:28,130 --> 01:08:28,490
Go back.

939
01:08:28,610 --> 01:08:30,170
Yeah, as soon as there's light,
I'll go.

940
01:08:30,590 --> 01:08:32,530
You know my parents are coming for lunch
Sunday?

941
01:08:34,070 --> 01:08:34,850
Yeah, why?

942
01:08:34,851 --> 01:08:35,851
I...

943
01:08:36,070 --> 01:08:37,570
I don't think you should be here.

944
01:08:38,770 --> 01:08:39,770
What does that mean?

945
01:08:40,510 --> 01:08:42,850
It means... I don't want you...

946
01:08:45,330 --> 01:08:46,330
I don't want you.

947
01:09:31,680 --> 01:09:32,680
I love you.

948
01:10:19,430 --> 01:10:20,430
What is that?

949
01:10:52,960 --> 01:11:00,480
I don't want you to...
I don't want you to...

950
01:11:39,280 --> 01:11:48,620
I don't want you
to... Thank God.

951
01:11:48,860 --> 01:11:50,440
What is happening?

952
01:11:56,120 --> 01:11:57,260
Fight it.

953
01:11:57,700 --> 01:11:58,800
Fight it.

954
01:12:02,600 --> 01:12:04,260
Baby, you've got to fight it.

955
01:12:25,640 --> 01:12:28,580
I just want to die.

956
01:12:28,940 --> 01:12:29,940
Baby, look at me.

957
01:12:30,060 --> 01:12:31,740
Stay with me, we can do this.

958
01:12:32,500 --> 01:12:34,700
Honey, do what?

959
01:12:36,100 --> 01:12:39,180
The drugs, the pills, the drugs.

960
01:12:40,020 --> 01:12:41,020
What?

961
01:12:42,520 --> 01:12:43,960
Muscle relaxes!

962
01:12:58,530 --> 01:13:00,030
Valium, Valium!

963
01:13:00,370 --> 01:13:02,070
It's called diazepam now.

964
01:13:05,970 --> 01:13:07,910
What do you child want?

965
01:13:08,370 --> 01:13:09,370
Hold it out.

966
01:13:16,470 --> 01:13:17,470
Help me!

967
01:13:18,470 --> 01:13:19,470
Take him!

968
01:13:22,790 --> 01:13:24,670
Okay, okay, quicker if we snort him.

969
01:13:28,750 --> 01:13:29,870
Oh, shit!

970
01:13:40,770 --> 01:13:41,770
Oh!

971
01:13:43,370 --> 01:13:46,650
Yeah, just put your feet against mine and
then push away.

972
01:13:46,850 --> 01:13:48,270
I can't do it!

973
01:13:48,590 --> 01:13:49,670
Baby, yes, you can!

974
01:13:49,850 --> 01:13:52,110
You're so fucking strong you can do it!

975
01:13:52,550 --> 01:13:53,830
I pushed me.

976
01:13:55,610 --> 01:13:57,510
We only need to last a couple minutes.

977
01:13:58,130 --> 01:13:59,130
I'm pushing!

978
01:14:01,930 --> 01:14:02,970
We got this!

979
01:14:03,250 --> 01:14:04,290
I can do it!

980
01:14:04,390 --> 01:14:05,050
We got this!

981
01:14:05,130 --> 01:14:06,130
Just keep pushing!

982
01:14:10,290 --> 01:14:11,330
Keep pushing!

983
01:14:12,430 --> 01:14:13,690
Just keep pushing!

984
01:14:21,400 --> 01:14:22,680
Just keep pushing.

985
01:14:53,100 --> 01:14:55,280
I was hoping I'd have more time before you
woke up.

986
01:14:55,920 --> 01:14:57,000
It's gonna be okay.

987
01:14:57,700 --> 01:14:58,700
What's going on?

988
01:14:59,100 --> 01:15:01,376
Sorry, we don't have time for you to hem
and haw about this.

989
01:15:01,400 --> 01:15:02,400
About what?

990
01:15:06,060 --> 01:15:08,060
Well, babe, it's a weird time for a joke.

991
01:15:08,560 --> 01:15:11,400
It's not getting worse, so the drugs must
still be in our system, right?

992
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:13,000
Wait.

993
01:15:13,160 --> 01:15:13,940
Wait, wait, babe, babe.

994
01:15:14,040 --> 01:15:16,476
I wasn't even sure that was the right tool
to fix the fucking Porsche.

995
01:15:16,500 --> 01:15:18,780
Listen, when the pills wear off,
it's gonna start again.

996
01:15:18,960 --> 01:15:20,040
No, babe, babe, babe, babe.

997
01:15:21,060 --> 01:15:23,249
Imagine what you're about
to do actually happening,

998
01:15:23,250 --> 01:15:25,620
and tell me that's not gonna
make things way worse!

999
01:15:25,621 --> 01:15:26,940
Whiskey for the pain.

1000
01:15:27,600 --> 01:15:30,200
And as soon as we're separated,
I'll sprint for the first aid kit.

1001
01:15:30,240 --> 01:15:32,740
We have bandages, disinfectant,
everything we need!

1002
01:15:32,960 --> 01:15:34,040
Oh, you're right-handed.

1003
01:15:34,220 --> 01:15:35,220
Oh, God!

1004
01:15:36,460 --> 01:15:37,980
Actually, maybe that's enough of that.

1005
01:15:38,160 --> 01:15:38,680
Why, why?

1006
01:15:39,160 --> 01:15:40,440
I think I can feel your whiskey.

1007
01:15:40,900 --> 01:15:42,320
You're right-handed and drunk!

1008
01:15:42,960 --> 01:15:44,880
Remember when you said you weren't holding
me hostage?

1009
01:15:44,881 --> 01:15:46,080
Do you think I wanna do this?

1010
01:15:46,160 --> 01:15:46,520
No!

1011
01:15:47,080 --> 01:15:47,480
Don't!

1012
01:15:47,540 --> 01:15:49,120
We are out of time!

1013
01:15:49,660 --> 01:15:49,800
No, no!

1014
01:15:49,801 --> 01:15:51,880
We need to do this while the joke is in
our system.

1015
01:15:51,881 --> 01:15:52,720
Then we can get help.

1016
01:15:52,860 --> 01:15:53,300
I'm sorry.

1017
01:15:53,460 --> 01:15:53,920
We have to.

1018
01:15:54,140 --> 01:15:54,700
We have to.

1019
01:15:54,840 --> 01:15:56,940
If we don't split now, it'll be much
harder later.

1020
01:15:57,140 --> 01:15:58,460
There's gotta be another way!

1021
01:15:59,300 --> 01:16:00,300
Do

1022
01:16:08,270 --> 01:16:08,470
it.

1023
01:16:08,810 --> 01:16:09,810
Do it.

1024
01:16:19,280 --> 01:16:19,680
Okay.

1025
01:16:19,920 --> 01:16:20,920
Careful, careful!

1026
01:16:21,100 --> 01:16:21,960
Alright, I'm doing it.

1027
01:16:21,980 --> 01:16:22,520
I'm doing it.

1028
01:16:22,660 --> 01:16:23,660
I'm doing it.

1029
01:16:24,280 --> 01:16:25,580
I'm doing it.

1030
01:16:31,480 --> 01:16:33,176
By the way, I'm sorry I didn't believe you
before.

1031
01:16:33,200 --> 01:16:33,740
You were right, obviously.

1032
01:16:33,920 --> 01:16:34,920
Babe, just go!

1033
01:16:35,100 --> 01:16:36,100
I wanna go.

1034
01:17:16,980 --> 01:17:18,880
A doctor isn't gonna be able to fix this!

1035
01:17:18,960 --> 01:17:19,460
Get in the trunk.

1036
01:17:19,620 --> 01:17:21,380
We need to keep as much distance as
possible.

1037
01:17:21,540 --> 01:17:24,440
Honey, the pills are gonna wear off-I
know, but more pills!

1038
01:17:24,560 --> 01:17:25,260
It's just a bandaid!

1039
01:17:25,360 --> 01:17:26,060
We need answers!

1040
01:17:26,080 --> 01:17:26,400
Kim!

1041
01:17:26,660 --> 01:17:29,020
I just sawed through our fucking arms!

1042
01:17:29,240 --> 01:17:30,880
We are going to the hospital!

1043
01:17:32,460 --> 01:17:33,460
Okay.

1044
01:17:34,620 --> 01:17:35,620
Okay.

1045
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:36,360
Shit.

1046
01:17:36,980 --> 01:17:37,300
What?

1047
01:17:37,380 --> 01:17:38,380
What's going on?

1048
01:17:38,600 --> 01:17:39,420
My keys.

1049
01:17:39,580 --> 01:17:41,000
I think I left them at Jamie's.

1050
01:17:41,460 --> 01:17:42,560
Why would you do that?

1051
01:17:42,860 --> 01:17:44,120
I didn't do it on purpose!

1052
01:17:44,400 --> 01:17:44,620
Sorry.

1053
01:17:44,920 --> 01:17:45,920
Come on.

1054
01:17:49,220 --> 01:17:50,220
You coming?

1055
01:17:50,940 --> 01:17:51,940
I'll wait.

1056
01:17:52,460 --> 01:17:53,540
Like you said, distance.

1057
01:17:54,760 --> 01:17:57,260
Tim, don't do anything stupid.

1058
01:18:38,090 --> 01:18:39,090
Jamie?

1059
01:19:07,110 --> 01:19:08,410
I'm so sorry.

1060
01:19:08,610 --> 01:19:09,130
It's me.

1061
01:19:09,350 --> 01:19:09,970
I'm just...

1062
01:19:10,320 --> 01:19:10,690
Sorry.

1063
01:19:11,050 --> 01:19:12,050
We need help.

1064
01:19:12,150 --> 01:19:14,250
It's... It's serious shit.

1065
01:19:19,310 --> 01:19:20,310
Jamie?

1066
01:19:51,270 --> 01:19:52,270
Hello?

1067
01:22:24,140 --> 01:22:26,020
The happiest day of our life.

1068
01:22:28,520 --> 01:22:29,580
I'll give these back.

1069
01:22:29,740 --> 01:22:30,740
Don't worry.

1070
01:22:31,740 --> 01:22:32,740
What is this?

1071
01:22:33,600 --> 01:22:35,260
The beginning of something wonderful.

1072
01:22:56,770 --> 01:22:57,890
Help me!

1073
01:22:58,390 --> 01:22:59,610
Stay away from me.

1074
01:22:59,870 --> 01:23:02,070
We were scared at first, too.

1075
01:23:02,410 --> 01:23:03,410
Everybody is.

1076
01:23:03,490 --> 01:23:05,810
But this is a great gift.

1077
01:23:06,580 --> 01:23:09,010
Such lucky few are we who become whole.

1078
01:23:09,830 --> 01:23:10,490
No.

1079
01:23:10,650 --> 01:23:11,650
I don't want this.

1080
01:23:11,710 --> 01:23:12,710
Oh, but you do.

1081
01:23:13,150 --> 01:23:16,570
The connection is deeper than anything you
could ever imagine.

1082
01:23:17,270 --> 01:23:18,710
No more walls.

1083
01:23:19,510 --> 01:23:22,150
Share fears and memories.

1084
01:23:22,910 --> 01:23:24,550
This is the hardest part.

1085
01:23:24,730 --> 01:23:26,350
You just have to push through.

1086
01:23:26,890 --> 01:23:27,290
Please.

1087
01:23:27,550 --> 01:23:31,510
What awaits is the ultimate intimacy in
divine flesh.

1088
01:23:32,010 --> 01:23:33,010
Stop it!

1089
01:23:35,650 --> 01:23:37,570
It's already happening.

1090
01:23:37,970 --> 01:23:39,810
You wouldn't like the alternative.

1091
01:23:58,730 --> 01:24:00,110
Help me!

1092
01:24:00,230 --> 01:24:01,230
Help me!

1093
01:24:03,150 --> 01:24:04,670
Help me!

1094
01:24:05,530 --> 01:24:06,530
Help me!

1095
01:24:08,610 --> 01:24:09,610
Billy!

1096
01:24:10,030 --> 01:24:11,030
Billy!

1097
01:24:12,350 --> 01:24:15,090
Rejoice in the intimacy that awaits.

1098
01:24:15,690 --> 01:24:17,250
No dissonance.

1099
01:24:17,490 --> 01:24:18,610
Only warmth.

1100
01:24:19,690 --> 01:24:22,710
I'm sorry, but it's best to be open for
each other.

1101
01:24:23,030 --> 01:24:24,590
It will hurry things along.

1102
01:24:42,380 --> 01:24:46,980
The God's jealousy has robbed you of your
perfect form.

1103
01:24:47,260 --> 01:24:51,380
Yet divine happiness is flowing through
us.

1104
01:24:52,040 --> 01:24:54,700
You will be so warm.

1105
01:25:08,720 --> 01:26:34,220
geometry Buggy I know, I know.

1106
01:26:35,100 --> 01:26:38,620
This thing, it's happened before,
we're not the first.

1107
01:26:39,020 --> 01:26:40,020
I know.

1108
01:26:44,050 --> 01:26:45,230
You went there.

1109
01:27:08,250 --> 01:27:10,210
I saw something down there.

1110
01:27:11,530 --> 01:27:13,370
I think I know how to stop it.

1111
01:27:20,940 --> 01:27:22,400
We can't fight it forever.

1112
01:27:22,880 --> 01:27:23,260
No!

1113
01:27:23,880 --> 01:27:24,880
Stay back!

1114
01:27:24,920 --> 01:27:25,460
It's okay.

1115
01:27:25,880 --> 01:27:26,940
You can let go.

1116
01:27:27,500 --> 01:27:29,160
Oh, honey, I'm serious.

1117
01:27:29,500 --> 01:27:30,540
Don't come any closer.

1118
01:27:31,040 --> 01:27:32,040
No.

1119
01:27:32,680 --> 01:27:34,120
There's only one way to end this.

1120
01:27:51,030 --> 01:27:52,030
What are you doing?

1121
01:27:53,130 --> 01:27:54,910
What I should have done a long time ago.

1122
01:28:03,070 --> 01:28:04,650
Are you fucking kidding me?

1123
01:28:09,260 --> 01:28:12,440
Babe, I used to worry I wouldn't remember
who I was without you.

1124
01:28:13,580 --> 01:28:16,380
But the truth is, I remember exactly who I
was.

1125
01:28:16,381 --> 01:28:18,920
Okay, I was miserable.

1126
01:28:19,340 --> 01:28:20,700
I was incomplete.

1127
01:28:21,160 --> 01:28:22,160
Cold.

1128
01:28:22,400 --> 01:28:26,086
So much time wasted
thinking about some other life

1129
01:28:26,087 --> 01:28:29,140
where all my bullshit
adolescent dreams came true.

1130
01:28:29,480 --> 01:28:32,500
But... Babe, you are
the dream that came true.

1131
01:28:34,260 --> 01:28:40,120
I'm so sorry it took me so long, but I
just... I fucking suck and I love you so much.

1132
01:28:40,340 --> 01:28:41,980
I love you so much.

1133
01:28:52,410 --> 01:28:53,410
Close your eyes.

1134
01:28:54,270 --> 01:28:55,270
What?

1135
01:28:56,390 --> 01:28:57,650
Trust me, close your eyes.

1136
01:28:58,790 --> 01:28:59,930
Tim, what are you doing?

1137
01:29:00,910 --> 01:29:03,270
This won't end until one of us is dead,
okay?

1138
01:29:03,750 --> 01:29:05,150
Babe, I don't want you to see this.

1139
01:29:05,210 --> 01:29:06,430
We don't have time, okay?

1140
01:29:06,550 --> 01:29:06,910
No, you don't have to.

1141
01:29:07,090 --> 01:29:07,730
You don't have to.

1142
01:29:08,030 --> 01:29:09,030
It's gonna be okay.

1143
01:29:09,770 --> 01:29:10,530
You'll be okay.

1144
01:29:10,531 --> 01:29:12,690
Babe, please just drop it.

1145
01:29:12,970 --> 01:29:13,970
Just drop it.

1146
01:29:14,110 --> 01:29:15,470
Please, just drop it.

1147
01:29:25,830 --> 01:29:26,830
Please, just drop it.

1148
01:29:27,710 --> 01:29:28,870
Babe, babe, babe, babe, babe.

1149
01:29:29,130 --> 01:29:30,130
Oh, shit.

1150
01:29:30,190 --> 01:29:31,190
Oh, shit.

1151
01:29:31,330 --> 01:29:31,730
Oh, shit.

1152
01:29:31,731 --> 01:29:31,770
Oh, shit.

1153
01:29:31,771 --> 01:29:32,771
Oh, God.

1154
01:29:32,870 --> 01:29:33,370
Oh, shit.

1155
01:29:33,650 --> 01:29:35,130
Baby, baby, hey, hey, hey.

1156
01:29:35,550 --> 01:29:36,550
Hey, stay with me, baby.

1157
01:29:36,770 --> 01:29:37,790
Hey, yes, yeah, hey, hey.

1158
01:29:38,110 --> 01:29:39,110
You gotta run.

1159
01:29:39,490 --> 01:29:40,690
You gotta be free.

1160
01:29:41,890 --> 01:29:43,470
I'll never be free from you.

1161
01:29:44,310 --> 01:29:45,850
Baby, I'll never.

1162
01:29:47,930 --> 01:29:49,330
Promise me one thing.

1163
01:29:49,570 --> 01:29:50,570
Anything.

1164
01:29:52,450 --> 01:29:55,350
You'll make my final post vrb dying.

1165
01:29:59,530 --> 01:30:04,530
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, Millie,
Millie, no, no, hey, Millie, Millie!

1166
01:30:05,090 --> 01:30:08,330
Shit, baby, baby, baby, stay with me,
please, please!

1167
01:30:10,690 --> 01:30:11,930
No, no, no, baby!

1168
01:31:09,190 --> 01:31:10,330
What have you done?

1169
01:31:12,130 --> 01:31:13,910
It's the only way to stop the bleeding.

1170
01:31:15,950 --> 01:31:16,950
What?

1171
01:31:24,110 --> 01:31:25,110
No.

1172
01:31:26,290 --> 01:31:27,450
No, no.

1173
01:31:29,870 --> 01:31:31,850
I was trying to let you go.

1174
01:31:33,450 --> 01:31:34,850
Did you want to let me go?

1175
01:31:43,390 --> 01:31:44,530
What are you doing?

1176
01:31:53,400 --> 01:31:54,940
It's your favorite album, right?

1177
01:31:57,040 --> 01:31:58,440
Do you remember that?

1178
01:31:59,320 --> 01:32:04,400
I always imagined it as our first dance,
but... Because maybe that won't happen now.

1179
01:32:25,030 --> 01:32:26,590
Are you sure you want this?

1180
01:32:28,290 --> 01:32:29,530
I do.

1181
01:32:30,030 --> 01:32:30,190
I do.

1182
01:32:30,191 --> 01:32:31,250
Say you believe it.

1183
01:32:31,310 --> 01:32:34,530
Say you believe it.

1184
01:32:34,990 --> 01:32:38,010
Free your mind without a danger.

1185
01:32:38,490 --> 01:32:41,090
Leave the real, don't be a stranger.

1186
01:32:41,970 --> 01:32:44,350
We can achieve it.

1187
01:32:45,150 --> 01:32:47,650
We can achieve it.

1188
01:32:48,430 --> 01:32:51,550
Come a little bit closer, baby.

1189
01:32:52,350 --> 01:32:53,350
Get it on.

1190
01:32:53,490 --> 01:32:54,490
Get it on.

1191
01:32:54,590 --> 01:32:54,710
Get it on.

1192
01:32:54,711 --> 01:32:56,131
Cause tonight... I love you.

1193
01:32:56,310 --> 01:32:57,590
I love you too.

1194
01:32:58,070 --> 01:33:00,510
When to become love.

1195
01:33:00,511 --> 01:33:02,990
I need some love.

1196
01:33:03,010 --> 01:33:03,390
I need some love.

1197
01:33:03,391 --> 01:33:05,210
Like I never needed love before.

1198
01:33:06,010 --> 01:33:07,910
One week in love to you, baby.

1199
01:33:08,170 --> 01:33:09,670
I had a little love.

1200
01:33:10,310 --> 01:33:12,050
Now I'm back for more.

1201
01:33:12,330 --> 01:33:14,830
One week in love to you, baby.

1202
01:33:15,130 --> 01:33:16,910
Set your spirit free.

1203
01:33:16,911 --> 01:33:20,730
It's the only way to be.

1204
01:33:20,830 --> 01:33:24,190
It's the only way to be.

1205
01:33:57,210 --> 01:34:01,890
I'm back.

1206
01:34:01,891 --> 01:34:03,890
Oh my god!

1207
01:34:05,630 --> 01:34:09,750
Oh my god!

1208
01:34:13,690 --> 01:34:14,690

empty cup, the open womb

Praise be to this useless love Next to all
we ever loved.

1216
01:38:28,840 --> 01:38:30,020
Another.

1217
01:38:32,160 --> 01:38:36,760
You're not another one, you're mine.

All that time.

Gone forever.

1223
01:39:16,590 --> 01:39:18,390
Only sky.

1224
01:39:19,910 --> 01:39:21,770
All that money.

1225
01:39:22,970 --> 01:39:25,270
All that time.

1226
01:39:26,810 --> 01:39:28,690
Climbed in heaven.

1227
01:39:30,150 --> 01:39:31,810
Orange, every pint.

1228
01:39:35,610 --> 01:39:36,590
Climbed in heaven.

1229
01:39:36,591 --> 01:39:38,850
