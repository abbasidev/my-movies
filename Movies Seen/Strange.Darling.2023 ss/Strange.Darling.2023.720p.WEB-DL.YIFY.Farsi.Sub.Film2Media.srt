1
00:00:54,837 --> 00:00:56,677
So, I'm gonna have
to ask you a question.

2
00:01:03,063 --> 00:01:04,455
Are you a serial killer?

<i>Although skeptics
don't believe it's a real thing,</i>

30
00:12:05,159 --> 00:12:06,159
<i>it is.</i>

31
00:12:07,117 --> 00:12:08,989
<i>But that's
for another broadcast.</i>

32
00:12:09,076 --> 00:12:10,294
<i>Today we're gonna talk about</i>

33
00:12:10,381 --> 00:12:12,514
<i>the chilling uncovering
of a Bigfoot family</i>

34
00:12:12,601 --> 00:12:14,603
<i>in the forest near his property</i>

35
00:12:14,690 --> 00:12:16,518
<i>and what Mitchell
is doing about it.</i>

36
00:12:17,258 --> 00:12:18,650
<i>Pretty serious subject.</i>

37
00:12:19,651 --> 00:12:20,696
<i>Let's jump right in.</i>

38
00:12:20,783 --> 00:12:23,177
<i>Mitchell W. Mahoney, everybody.</i>

39
00:12:23,264 --> 00:12:25,875
<i>- Mitchell, are you there?
- I am. I am.</i>

40
00:12:25,962 --> 00:12:27,703
<i>Listening with both ears.</i>

41
00:12:27,790 --> 00:12:29,444
<i>I ain't taking no goddamn...</i>

42
00:12:29,531 --> 00:12:31,402
<i>Oh! Oh!
I must stop you there, sir.</i>

43
00:12:31,489 --> 00:12:33,535
<i>As you know,
our number-one rule is no bad language.</i>

44
00:12:33,622 --> 00:12:35,165
<i>Oh, shit.
Yeah, that's right. I'm sorry.</i>

45
00:12:35,189 --> 00:12:36,732
<i>- Didn't mean it.
- No harm, no foul.</i>

46
00:12:36,756 --> 00:12:39,019
<i>It's an emotional subject.
I understand. Carry on, sir.</i>

47
00:12:39,106 --> 00:12:41,456
<i>So I take a quick shot
of Old Grand-Dad</i>

48
00:12:41,543 --> 00:12:43,066
<i>and I go out there.</i>

49
00:12:43,153 --> 00:12:45,286
<i>Shotgun cocked.</i>

50
00:12:45,373 --> 00:12:48,811
<i>And the whole time
I hear the dogs</i>

51
00:12:48,898 --> 00:12:52,336
<i>but when I opened the door
to go outside,</i>

52
00:12:52,423 --> 00:12:56,297
<i>it stops.
Real quick like, wild.</i>

53
00:12:56,384 --> 00:12:57,472
Hey. Hey!

54
00:13:11,573 --> 00:13:13,140
Can you help me? Please?

55
00:13:29,330 --> 00:13:31,288
Here, kitty,
kitty, kitty.

56
00:13:38,208 --> 00:13:39,862
<i>Which really upset me</i>

57
00:13:39,949 --> 00:13:41,690
<i>because we were gonna
butcher it next month.</i>

58
00:13:41,777 --> 00:13:43,213
<i>Now the whole thing's
gone away.</i>

59
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:44,475
<i>I can't hear that.</i>

60
00:13:44,562 --> 00:13:46,564
<i>But the worst
part was,</i>

61
00:13:46,651 --> 00:13:49,045
<i>the grizzly nature
of the whole thing.</i>

62
00:13:57,097 --> 00:13:59,403
<i>Yeah. There you go.
It's nomenclature.</i>

63
00:13:59,490 --> 00:14:01,753
<i>What if it attacked me?</i>

64
00:14:01,841 --> 00:14:04,191
<i>All her innards
were taken out and eaten.</i>

65
00:14:04,278 --> 00:14:09,065
<i>Whatever it was,
it's a loose sack of flesh and fur.</i>

66
00:14:09,152 --> 00:14:11,067
<i>At first I thought
it would be gray.</i>

67
00:14:11,154 --> 00:14:13,069
<i>We've had them
here before too.</i>

68
00:14:13,156 --> 00:14:15,811
<i>Just to clarify
for our listeners,</i>

69
00:14:15,898 --> 00:14:19,075
<i>Mitchell was just referring to
extra-terrestrial entities.</i>

70
00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:22,644
<i>Yeah.
Yeah, thanks, Art.</i>

71
00:14:43,708 --> 00:14:45,406
Here, kitty,
kitty, kitty.

72
00:15:15,044 --> 00:15:18,613
<i>...went
to Nova Scotia in 1972,</i>

73
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:22,399
<i>down in Breckenridge, Colorado
in 1987.</i>

74
00:15:22,486 --> 00:15:27,013
<i>Yet again, Moran County
back in 2013.</i>

75
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:30,059
<i>I'm very familiar
with the anatomy of those things.</i>

76
00:15:30,146 --> 00:15:32,844
<i>And even just seeing the outline
in the moonlight,</i>

77
00:15:32,932 --> 00:15:35,021
<i>I knew immediately
what it was.</i>

78
00:15:35,108 --> 00:15:36,631
<i>Of course. Of course.</i>

79
00:15:36,718 --> 00:15:40,026
<i>And was that the extent of it,
or have you continued to be...</i>

80
00:15:40,113 --> 00:15:42,202
<i>pestered, for lack of
a better word?</i>

81
00:15:42,289 --> 00:15:47,076
<i>No. No.
They keep coming.</i>

82
00:15:47,163 --> 00:15:48,904
<i>They've been eating my hens
one by one...</i>

83
00:15:48,991 --> 00:15:50,601
Here, kitty, kitty, kitty!

84
00:15:55,998 --> 00:15:57,043
Fuck!

85
00:18:32,459 --> 00:18:34,939
Here, kitty, kitty, kitty.

86
00:19:37,567 --> 00:19:39,700
These aren't the same.

87
00:19:39,787 --> 00:19:41,702
Mmm-mmm. Probably better
for you, though.

88
00:19:41,789 --> 00:19:44,183
Mmm... Doubt that.

89
00:19:52,408 --> 00:19:54,628
I even smoked
one of yours tonight.

90
00:19:57,283 --> 00:19:58,283
But first...

91
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:14,778
A-plus.

92
00:20:18,347 --> 00:20:21,176
- That's a relief.
- Yes, it is.

93
00:20:23,134 --> 00:20:25,136
Do you still want to, um,

94
00:20:27,051 --> 00:20:28,444
get a room?

95
00:20:29,358 --> 00:20:31,186
Can we just, uh,

96
00:20:33,623 --> 00:20:35,669
make out a little bit?

97
00:20:36,626 --> 00:20:37,627
Yeah.

98
00:20:38,715 --> 00:20:39,847
Okay.

99
00:20:58,082 --> 00:21:00,389
Look, we can just...

100
00:21:00,476 --> 00:21:02,783
We can just swap numbers
if you don't wanna...

101
00:21:02,870 --> 00:21:06,003
Well, okay.
You wanna get...

102
00:21:06,090 --> 00:21:07,396
You wanna get digits?

103
00:21:10,660 --> 00:21:13,184
Nobody gets digits anymore.
It's about the Insta.

104
00:21:13,272 --> 00:21:16,013
I guess I'm just getting old.

105
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:17,406
Well, you are.

106
00:21:19,234 --> 00:21:20,888
I guess that's what I'm into.

107
00:21:37,948 --> 00:21:40,255
This is gonna sound
like bullshit, but, uh...

108
00:21:44,041 --> 00:21:45,565
I don't really do this.

109
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:49,003
I mean,
I have no problem doing it.

110
00:21:49,090 --> 00:21:50,744
I...

111
00:21:50,831 --> 00:21:52,659
I just have to really want it.

112
00:21:55,139 --> 00:21:57,707
Do you want it?

113
00:21:57,794 --> 00:21:59,709
Or are you, like, about to

114
00:21:59,796 --> 00:22:02,016
tell me to go fuck myself?

115
00:22:02,103 --> 00:22:03,713
No, no, I really want it.

116
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:06,499
I just... I... I like...

117
00:22:08,414 --> 00:22:10,154
sobered up a little bit
on the ride over

118
00:22:10,241 --> 00:22:12,331
and started judging myself,
I guess.

119
00:22:15,072 --> 00:22:17,118
Look, my groceries
are on one shelf.

120
00:22:17,205 --> 00:22:19,033
Hers are on the other.
You know what I mean?

121
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:21,252
If I cared, I would've said
something at the bar.

122
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:24,299
And if she cared,
I wouldn't fucking be here.

123
00:22:25,474 --> 00:22:26,562
Your...

124
00:22:26,649 --> 00:22:28,782
Your business
is not my business.

125
00:22:31,088 --> 00:22:34,440
What this is here,
it's recreation.

126
00:22:34,527 --> 00:22:35,963
And I fucking deserve it.

127
00:22:42,839 --> 00:22:44,145
Hell, yeah.

128
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:49,803
Okay.

129
00:22:54,329 --> 00:22:55,330
Mmm.

130
00:22:56,157 --> 00:22:57,332
It's garbage.

131
00:23:04,078 --> 00:23:05,079
Mmm.

132
00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:10,301
Yeah.

133
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:18,832
Ooh.

134
00:23:19,746 --> 00:23:20,877
You know...

135
00:23:27,406 --> 00:23:29,756
The real issue is safety.

136
00:23:29,843 --> 00:23:31,255
Once I'm alone with you
in that room,

137
00:23:31,279 --> 00:23:33,673
it's just us, no witnesses.

138
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:35,283
Do you have any idea
the kind of risks

139
00:23:35,370 --> 00:23:36,763
a woman like me
takes every time

140
00:23:36,850 --> 00:23:39,069
she agrees to have
a little bit of fun?

141
00:23:42,986 --> 00:23:44,423
It's a goddamn tragedy.

142
00:23:46,425 --> 00:23:49,732
Men think that
we're these prudes

143
00:23:49,819 --> 00:23:51,517
who don't like casual sex.

144
00:23:51,604 --> 00:23:53,649
Most of us
fucking love casual sex.

145
00:23:53,736 --> 00:23:54,976
We just want to know
that murder

146
00:23:55,042 --> 00:23:56,913
isn't gonna be served
on the side.

147
00:23:59,307 --> 00:24:00,308
Jesus.

148
00:24:01,614 --> 00:24:03,093
Never thought about it
that way.

149
00:24:03,180 --> 00:24:04,399
Of course you haven't.

150
00:24:06,140 --> 00:24:07,315
You're not a woman.

151
00:24:11,058 --> 00:24:12,407
Then there's, you know,

152
00:24:12,494 --> 00:24:14,017
plain old risk
of disappointment,

153
00:24:14,104 --> 00:24:15,976
which is the most common, but...

154
00:24:19,632 --> 00:24:20,763
violence...

155
00:24:22,591 --> 00:24:23,810
That's no joke.

156
00:24:25,812 --> 00:24:27,204
That's life or death.

157
00:24:42,568 --> 00:24:44,700
I think I, um...

158
00:24:44,787 --> 00:24:46,485
I think I want one of those now.

159
00:24:53,753 --> 00:24:54,754
Mmm.

160
00:25:03,893 --> 00:25:05,504
You seem like a nice guy.

161
00:25:07,723 --> 00:25:09,464
You do.

162
00:25:11,814 --> 00:25:13,294
But you never really know.

163
00:25:15,731 --> 00:25:17,472
So, I'm gonna have
to ask you a question.

164
00:25:24,348 --> 00:25:26,002
Are you a serial killer?

165
00:25:26,481 --> 00:25:28,570
What?

166
00:25:28,657 --> 00:25:30,572
I'm gonna need you
to look me in the eyes

167
00:25:30,659 --> 00:25:33,532
and give me a serious answer.

168
00:25:37,927 --> 00:25:38,928
No.

169
00:25:43,367 --> 00:25:45,239
- No...
- No.

170
00:25:45,892 --> 00:25:46,936
What?

171
00:25:47,023 --> 00:25:48,677
No, I'm not...

172
00:25:51,071 --> 00:25:52,768
a serial killer.

173
00:26:01,603 --> 00:26:02,648
Okay.

174
00:26:06,739 --> 00:26:08,044
Okay.

175
00:26:15,748 --> 00:26:17,116
Now can we talk about
all the things

176
00:26:17,140 --> 00:26:18,272
I want you to do to me?

177
00:26:42,992 --> 00:26:44,124
Harder.

178
00:26:56,223 --> 00:26:57,224
Harder.

179
00:27:06,015 --> 00:27:07,103
Stop.

180
00:27:16,025 --> 00:27:17,505
Can you take these off me?

181
00:28:08,164 --> 00:28:09,775
I don't know
why this isn't working.

182
00:28:17,696 --> 00:28:18,827
It's your idea.

183
00:28:28,881 --> 00:28:30,099
Maybe it's you.

184
00:28:33,799 --> 00:28:35,452
What did you just say?

185
00:28:42,155 --> 00:28:44,200
Maybe I just
don't need it with you.

186
00:28:46,246 --> 00:28:48,552
Well...

187
00:28:48,639 --> 00:28:52,208
Well, look, maybe it's better
that we don't need that

188
00:28:54,645 --> 00:28:55,734
in the beginning.

189
00:29:01,435 --> 00:29:02,566
"The beginning."

190
00:29:06,701 --> 00:29:08,094
If I didn't know any better,

191
00:29:08,181 --> 00:29:10,226
I'd think you were
on the verge of asking for digits.

192
00:29:14,230 --> 00:29:15,231
What are they?

193
00:29:15,318 --> 00:29:16,363
Hmm.

194
00:29:18,191 --> 00:29:19,975
Stop.

195
00:29:20,062 --> 00:29:22,369
- Or social media?
- I'm not on social media.

196
00:29:23,326 --> 00:29:25,285
See...

197
00:29:25,372 --> 00:29:27,374
That makes me
really want that number.

198
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:33,772
This just got
really fucking complicated.

199
00:30:06,717 --> 00:30:07,936
Well, aren't you eager?

200
00:30:12,114 --> 00:30:13,115
Hmm?

201
00:30:21,341 --> 00:30:22,342
Hmm.

202
00:30:45,104 --> 00:30:46,235
What are you doing?

203
00:30:49,021 --> 00:30:50,152
Do you like that?

204
00:30:51,284 --> 00:30:52,285
Stop.

205
00:30:53,025 --> 00:30:55,157
Okay, baby.

206
00:30:55,244 --> 00:30:57,222
- Can you just wait a minute?
- I don't want to wait.

207
00:30:57,246 --> 00:30:58,857
I said I need a fucking minute!

208
00:31:15,699 --> 00:31:16,918
What are you doing?

209
00:31:23,925 --> 00:31:27,624
Take these off me now.

210
00:31:27,711 --> 00:31:29,365
You don't get to decide.

211
00:31:30,018 --> 00:31:32,412
Yes, I do get to decide.

212
00:31:32,499 --> 00:31:35,502
Just because I asked you
to cuff me at first

213
00:31:35,589 --> 00:31:37,634
doesn't mean that
you don't need my permission.

214
00:31:37,721 --> 00:31:39,027
Wrong.

215
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:43,771
Get off of me, motherfucker!

216
00:31:48,732 --> 00:31:51,257
You don't fucking hit me!

217
00:31:51,344 --> 00:31:55,217
"Please don't
fucking hit me, sir."

218
00:31:56,958 --> 00:31:58,960
From now on,
you only refer to me as sir.

219
00:31:59,047 --> 00:32:00,309
Do you understand me?

220
00:32:01,049 --> 00:32:02,137
Stop it!

221
00:32:12,365 --> 00:32:13,627
I'm in control.

222
00:32:16,543 --> 00:32:18,023
Now here's what's gonna happen.

223
00:32:20,808 --> 00:32:22,766
Please don't kill me.

224
00:32:28,772 --> 00:32:33,429
First, you're gonna take
my foot in your mouth.

225
00:32:33,516 --> 00:32:35,562
Toes first, all the way
to the fucking heel.

226
00:32:37,216 --> 00:32:40,088
You don't get to make noise!
You just shut the fuck up!

227
00:32:53,232 --> 00:32:54,798
You're a sick woman.

228
00:32:58,411 --> 00:33:01,849
Carrying around shackles
trying to get fucked.

229
00:33:05,896 --> 00:33:07,898
You know
you asked for this, right?

230
00:33:10,989 --> 00:33:12,251
Yes.

231
00:33:13,426 --> 00:33:14,427
Yes, what?

232
00:33:17,256 --> 00:33:19,388
Yes, sir.

233
00:33:23,871 --> 00:33:26,569
I'm gonna take my knife
and I'm gonna cut you.

234
00:33:28,180 --> 00:33:31,270
From one set of lips
to the other.

235
00:33:31,357 --> 00:33:33,315
Watch you bleed to death.

236
00:33:43,543 --> 00:33:45,284
Mr. Snuffleupagus!

237
00:33:45,371 --> 00:33:47,242
I can't believe
that you're into this.

238
00:33:48,287 --> 00:33:50,463
Just relax, okay.

239
00:33:50,550 --> 00:33:53,901
I don't know if I'm into it,
but I'm willing to try.

240
00:33:53,988 --> 00:33:55,772
No, no, no.
I'm gonna have to believe you,

241
00:33:55,859 --> 00:33:58,819
or it's gonna be a huge,
huge fucking turn off.

242
00:34:02,170 --> 00:34:03,998
I mean,
I did do a little bit of acting.

243
00:34:04,694 --> 00:34:05,913
What?

244
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,829
I was in a Holiday Inn Express
commercial once.

245
00:34:08,916 --> 00:34:09,917
What?

246
00:34:12,398 --> 00:34:14,182
So you might actually be
good at this.

247
00:34:14,269 --> 00:34:16,184
Look, hawking
the free hot breakfast

248
00:34:16,271 --> 00:34:18,143
ain't the same
as slapping a woman around,

249
00:34:18,230 --> 00:34:20,382
telling her you're gonna
chop her up into little pieces.

250
00:34:20,406 --> 00:34:22,756
But look, I'm willing to try.

251
00:34:22,843 --> 00:34:24,125
No, no,
I don't want any chopping.

252
00:34:24,149 --> 00:34:25,454
I want something intimate.

253
00:34:26,238 --> 00:34:29,110
Something romantic.

254
00:34:30,938 --> 00:34:32,026
Like a slit throat.

255
00:34:34,246 --> 00:34:35,246
Uh...

256
00:34:39,425 --> 00:34:41,122
You know
you're a little fucked up?

257
00:34:48,260 --> 00:34:50,653
You know you men will do
just about anything to get laid?

258
00:34:50,740 --> 00:34:52,220
- Get the fuck out of here.
- Huh?

259
00:34:52,307 --> 00:34:54,483
Get the fuck out of here
with that.

260
00:34:54,570 --> 00:34:57,704
Don't sell me the car
and then tell me not to drive it.

261
00:35:02,143 --> 00:35:03,710
Okay, okay. But...

262
00:35:06,016 --> 00:35:08,932
Don't tell me when you're gonna turn,
you just do it.

263
00:35:09,019 --> 00:35:11,196
And if I say no, you say yes.

264
00:35:11,283 --> 00:35:14,112
And you push even harder.

265
00:35:14,199 --> 00:35:17,115
If I'm, you know,
scared or angry.

266
00:35:18,333 --> 00:35:20,248
Even fucking crying.

267
00:35:20,335 --> 00:35:21,335
I don't...

268
00:35:23,773 --> 00:35:25,079
I don't like that.

269
00:35:26,211 --> 00:35:27,560
Don't be a fucking pussy.

270
00:35:27,647 --> 00:35:29,344
Are you serious?

271
00:35:29,431 --> 00:35:32,782
I cannot imagine consent being any more clear.

272
00:35:36,830 --> 00:35:37,831
Okay.

273
00:35:39,049 --> 00:35:40,050
All right.

274
00:35:45,143 --> 00:35:46,144
Yes.

275
00:35:59,113 --> 00:36:00,114
Pop quiz.

276
00:36:02,029 --> 00:36:03,161
What's "no" mean?

277
00:36:06,381 --> 00:36:07,817
Yes.

278
00:36:07,904 --> 00:36:11,299
And what is the only word
in the entire English language

279
00:36:11,386 --> 00:36:13,040
that actually means no

280
00:36:13,127 --> 00:36:15,477
once we're alone together
in that room?

281
00:36:18,741 --> 00:36:20,178
Mr. Snuffleupagus.

282
00:36:20,265 --> 00:36:21,962
Mr. Snuffleupagus!

283
00:36:24,530 --> 00:36:25,530
You okay?

284
00:36:26,009 --> 00:36:27,228
Not really.

285
00:36:28,447 --> 00:36:29,447
Shit.

286
00:36:32,625 --> 00:36:33,756
I'm so sorry.

287
00:36:39,893 --> 00:36:41,111
How can you say

288
00:36:41,199 --> 00:36:43,244
those awful things to me?

289
00:36:48,641 --> 00:36:50,033
Fuck! You told...

290
00:36:50,120 --> 00:36:51,905
You told me to say 'em.
I thought...

291
00:36:55,517 --> 00:36:58,390
You were fucking fantastic.

292
00:36:58,477 --> 00:37:00,696
I have never been
so turned on in my life.

293
00:37:02,785 --> 00:37:03,786
Mmm!

294
00:37:06,833 --> 00:37:07,834
Mmm.

295
00:37:08,748 --> 00:37:10,924
Then why Mr. Snuffleupagus?

296
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:16,321
I just needed a break.

297
00:37:17,409 --> 00:37:20,325
You know, a glass of water,

298
00:37:21,978 --> 00:37:24,633
maybe a cigarette, a drink.

299
00:37:26,505 --> 00:37:28,115
There's no rush, right?

300
00:38:08,895 --> 00:38:09,896
Hmm...

301
00:39:43,119 --> 00:39:44,120
Bon appetit.

302
00:39:52,215 --> 00:39:53,260
Mmm.

303
00:39:54,783 --> 00:39:56,611
Mmm-hmm.

304
00:39:59,701 --> 00:40:01,834
Mmm, mmm.

305
00:40:09,929 --> 00:40:11,321
What do you got?

306
00:40:11,409 --> 00:40:13,498
You're three ahead of me.

307
00:40:13,585 --> 00:40:15,737
Looks like you've got that one
ready to go for the nose.

308
00:40:15,761 --> 00:40:17,589
Stop.

309
00:40:17,676 --> 00:40:19,721
I don't need you
to help me win. Goddamn it.

310
00:40:19,808 --> 00:40:21,549
I want this thing
fair and square.

311
00:40:22,942 --> 00:40:24,247
Now only two.

312
00:40:28,774 --> 00:40:30,732
Oh, my...

313
00:40:32,430 --> 00:40:35,128
Don't get too excited.
I'm still up by one.

314
00:40:35,215 --> 00:40:36,695
Not for long, fucker.

315
00:40:36,782 --> 00:40:38,174
Hey, hey!

316
00:40:39,219 --> 00:40:41,961
Hey, hey! Hey!

317
00:40:48,794 --> 00:40:50,360
That's a crazy lady.

318
00:40:50,448 --> 00:40:51,666
Get the bear spray.

319
00:40:59,152 --> 00:41:00,632
Can you help me? Please?

320
00:41:05,550 --> 00:41:07,943
You sure it wasn't
one of 'em things done this to you?

321
00:41:08,030 --> 00:41:10,032
Shh.
Don't say it out loud.

322
00:41:10,816 --> 00:41:11,816
What things?

323
00:41:13,209 --> 00:41:14,559
It's Squatchy in those woods.

324
00:41:14,646 --> 00:41:16,299
We don't go too deep in 'em.

325
00:41:16,386 --> 00:41:17,779
Squatchy?

326
00:41:17,866 --> 00:41:20,260
- You're sure it was a man did this to you?
- Yes.

327
00:41:20,347 --> 00:41:22,871
- He was chasing me in a truck.
- A pickup truck?

328
00:41:22,958 --> 00:41:24,743
Squatch can't drive
no pickup truck.

329
00:41:24,830 --> 00:41:27,833
You'd be one dead shitass
if Squatch was at it.

330
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:28,921
Do you have a gun?

331
00:41:29,008 --> 00:41:30,183
We have bear spray.

332
00:41:30,270 --> 00:41:32,490
I thought
mountain people had guns.

333
00:41:32,577 --> 00:41:33,882
We ain't mountain people.

334
00:41:33,969 --> 00:41:35,580
We're just old hippies.

335
00:41:41,107 --> 00:41:44,240
Sweetie, do you want something
for the pain? Aspirin?

336
00:41:44,327 --> 00:41:45,609
How about something
a little bit stronger?

337
00:41:45,633 --> 00:41:47,026
- Percocet?
- Yes.

338
00:41:47,113 --> 00:41:49,028
We only have
a few of those left.

339
00:41:49,115 --> 00:41:50,235
Now, don't be selfish, Mama.

340
00:41:50,290 --> 00:41:51,378
You're right, Papa.

341
00:41:52,858 --> 00:41:53,902
Call the cops.

342
00:41:55,077 --> 00:41:56,514
Better they're on the way.

343
00:41:57,993 --> 00:41:59,560
What's that?

344
00:41:59,647 --> 00:42:02,302
Oh, we ain't into Scott Baio.

345
00:42:02,389 --> 00:42:03,975
They give 'em away free
at the flea market.

346
00:42:03,999 --> 00:42:06,306
- We take whatever they got.
- No. What's that?

347
00:42:06,393 --> 00:42:08,153
- That's our Sunday breakfast.
- Do you mind?

348
00:42:08,700 --> 00:42:09,701
Get in there.

349
00:42:09,788 --> 00:42:11,485
Hold on.
Let me give you a chair.

350
00:42:11,572 --> 00:42:12,965
- Right here. Right here.
- Okay.

351
00:42:17,622 --> 00:42:18,753
Old biker.

352
00:42:19,537 --> 00:42:20,929
Huh?

353
00:42:21,016 --> 00:42:23,932
She said we're old hippies.
I'm more of an old biker.

354
00:42:24,019 --> 00:42:26,152
Got a '59 Indian
sitting in the garage.

355
00:42:26,239 --> 00:42:27,695
Doesn't run anymore,
but doesn't matter.

356
00:42:27,719 --> 00:42:29,634
I couldn't ride it anyway.

357
00:42:32,201 --> 00:42:33,855
Lost it on the bike.

358
00:42:33,942 --> 00:42:36,597
Whole thing? That's heavy.

359
00:42:36,684 --> 00:42:37,835
Just up to the knee.

360
00:42:37,859 --> 00:42:39,097
You ride one of those every day,

361
00:42:39,121 --> 00:42:40,775
doesn't matter how good you are.

362
00:42:40,862 --> 00:42:42,603
It doesn't matter.

363
00:42:42,690 --> 00:42:45,345
<i>Can't find the stronger stuff.
Where is it?</i>

364
00:42:45,432 --> 00:42:47,042
Upstairs bathroom.

365
00:42:47,129 --> 00:42:48,783
<i>Police on the way?</i>

366
00:42:48,870 --> 00:42:50,350
Yes, honey.

367
00:42:50,437 --> 00:42:51,525
No.

368
00:42:51,612 --> 00:42:52,787
Don't you worry one bit.

369
00:42:52,874 --> 00:42:54,528
You're gonna feel
real nice soon.

370
00:42:54,615 --> 00:42:56,138
I meant no police.

371
00:42:56,225 --> 00:42:58,532
No, no. It's better that we call them.
Genevieve's right.

372
00:42:58,619 --> 00:43:01,230
Come on, man.
Just give it a minute, please.

373
00:43:01,317 --> 00:43:03,015
It's best
we let them know.

374
00:43:04,407 --> 00:43:06,627
Please, man, do me this favor.
No fucking cops.

375
00:43:51,367 --> 00:43:53,892
Genevieve. Genevieve.

376
00:43:55,371 --> 00:43:56,503
Genevieve.

377
00:44:03,031 --> 00:44:04,554
Percocet...

378
00:44:06,165 --> 00:44:07,209
Genevieve...

379
00:44:14,434 --> 00:44:17,219
I didn't wanna do that.
I had to.

380
00:44:17,306 --> 00:44:20,483
Can you just...
Can you put your hands up, please?

381
00:44:20,570 --> 00:44:22,747
Just to make us
both feel more relaxed.

382
00:44:26,925 --> 00:44:29,033
This is gonna be a really
tough one for you to believe,

383
00:44:29,057 --> 00:44:31,538
but I'm not gonna kill you.

384
00:44:32,844 --> 00:44:33,888
I promise.

385
00:44:35,673 --> 00:44:37,022
Sure.

386
00:44:37,109 --> 00:44:38,989
I am gonna have to tie you up, though.
All right?

387
00:44:41,896 --> 00:44:42,984
All right.

388
00:44:43,071 --> 00:44:44,511
What do you recommend
that's fastest?

389
00:44:45,900 --> 00:44:48,424
You have some... some cuffs?

390
00:44:48,511 --> 00:44:51,645
Or is there a rope or...
Or is there something

391
00:44:51,732 --> 00:44:53,865
that I can put you in
and lock it from the outside?

392
00:44:53,952 --> 00:44:55,669
Whatever is most comfortable
for you is fine

393
00:44:55,693 --> 00:44:57,042
as long as it's fast.

394
00:44:57,129 --> 00:44:58,652
Well, that's thoughtful of you.

395
00:44:58,739 --> 00:45:00,088
I'm not trying
to fuck up your day

396
00:45:00,175 --> 00:45:01,742
any more than I already have.

397
00:45:01,829 --> 00:45:03,918
There's a storm shelter
outside. There's...

398
00:45:05,093 --> 00:45:08,531
There's some, um, chain

399
00:45:08,618 --> 00:45:13,101
you can use on the handles
once I'm in.

400
00:45:13,188 --> 00:45:16,061
And we even got food and such
that'll last a while.

401
00:45:18,411 --> 00:45:20,805
We aren't just old hippies.

402
00:45:20,892 --> 00:45:21,892
We're...

403
00:45:23,721 --> 00:45:24,852
Doomsdayers.

404
00:45:25,592 --> 00:45:26,898
Okay, let's go.

405
00:46:55,377 --> 00:46:56,378
Fuck!

406
00:47:56,961 --> 00:47:57,961
What?

407
00:48:01,313 --> 00:48:03,489
What? Something on my face?

408
00:48:03,576 --> 00:48:04,882
Like, what?

409
00:48:10,235 --> 00:48:14,065
I was just looking at you

410
00:48:14,152 --> 00:48:17,982
and you are so handsome.

411
00:48:19,026 --> 00:48:20,723
It went straight to my head.

412
00:48:23,857 --> 00:48:27,513
How did I get so lucky tonight?

413
00:48:38,872 --> 00:48:40,352
Do you like to party?

414
00:48:54,540 --> 00:48:56,672
Oh, fuck.

415
00:48:56,759 --> 00:48:59,023
It's going to be light soon.

416
00:48:59,110 --> 00:49:01,721
Mmm. Come on.

417
00:49:01,808 --> 00:49:04,028
Checkout's not until noon
and this stuff

418
00:49:05,333 --> 00:49:11,165
gets me really fucking horny.

419
00:49:13,689 --> 00:49:16,649
It's been a long time
since I touched that stuff.

420
00:49:17,432 --> 00:49:18,564
Me too.

421
00:49:22,002 --> 00:49:23,221
But it's my birthday.

422
00:49:25,049 --> 00:49:26,049
And...

423
00:49:28,487 --> 00:49:29,967
a friend got it for me.

424
00:49:30,054 --> 00:49:32,230
It's, you know,
like a special occasion sort of thing.

425
00:49:37,409 --> 00:49:38,976
Birthday, huh?

426
00:49:39,063 --> 00:49:40,107
Yeah.

427
00:49:44,111 --> 00:49:46,635
All right.

428
00:49:46,722 --> 00:49:51,162
Well, I can't let a lady down
on her birthday now, can I?

429
00:49:55,079 --> 00:49:56,384
Oh, yeah.

430

01:04:40,789 --> 01:04:42,767
Do you have a bandage big
enough for this in that bag?

544
01:04:42,791 --> 01:04:43,923
Yes.

545
01:04:44,010 --> 01:04:46,317
Okay. I'm gonna need
to borrow your car.

546
01:04:48,232 --> 01:04:50,364
Come on.

547
01:04:50,451 --> 01:04:52,627
- Which fucking key is it?
- It's... It's that one.

548
01:04:52,714 --> 01:04:55,717
- It's that one.
- Okay. What car?

549
01:04:55,804 --> 01:04:58,807
It's the '78 Pinto,
right outside.

550
01:04:58,895 --> 01:05:00,635
- Seriously?
- Yeah.

551
01:05:01,810 --> 01:05:02,811
Okay.

552
01:05:03,856 --> 01:05:05,176
Now take off
your fucking clothes.

553
01:07:21,254 --> 01:07:22,516
Hey, Pete.

554
01:07:23,648 --> 01:07:26,390
It's, um... It's RC. Um...

555
01:07:28,044 --> 01:07:30,742
Listen, I'm out here near, uh,
near SR 78

556
01:07:31,612 --> 01:07:33,614
and the old Wilton Bridge.

557
01:07:33,701 --> 01:07:35,312
There's a farmhouse

558
01:07:36,791 --> 01:07:39,055
on the south edge
near the fire road. I, um...

559
01:07:40,882 --> 01:07:42,188
I need you to get out here.

560
01:07:43,972 --> 01:07:45,191
I, uh...

561
01:07:50,153 --> 01:07:52,503
I got myself into
a little bit of trouble.

562
01:08:40,681 --> 01:08:44,424
Got you, you fucking cunt!

563
01:08:47,384 --> 01:08:49,516
I fucking got you.

564
01:08:49,603 --> 01:08:50,735
That's true.

565
01:08:53,955 --> 01:08:55,435
It's like checkmate.

566
01:08:56,262 --> 01:08:57,262
Yeah.

567
01:08:57,872 --> 01:08:59,047
And then some.

568
01:09:02,138 --> 01:09:03,965
There's nothing
more than checkmate.

569
01:09:04,052 --> 01:09:06,620
It either is or it isn't,

570
01:09:06,707 --> 01:09:10,363
you fucking philistine.

571
01:09:13,975 --> 01:09:15,151
Why am I still alive?

572
01:09:20,417 --> 01:09:21,635
You couldn't do it.

573
01:09:24,421 --> 01:09:25,596
After all that.

574
01:09:28,294 --> 01:09:30,905
Oh.

575
01:09:30,992 --> 01:09:32,646
You're gonna be in trouble.

576
01:09:32,733 --> 01:09:34,387
Yeah, well...

577
01:09:36,781 --> 01:09:38,061
I'll take
a little bit of trouble

578
01:09:38,086 --> 01:09:40,045
over a life sentence any day.

579
01:09:45,398 --> 01:09:47,183
You want me
to call your sponsor?

580
01:09:53,058 --> 01:09:54,973
Are you really
The Electric Lady?

581
01:09:57,062 --> 01:09:58,585
I don't care about jail.

582
01:10:00,935 --> 01:10:02,633
I just don't wanna die.

583
01:10:03,938 --> 01:10:05,288
Isn't that fucking funny?

584
01:10:08,987 --> 01:10:10,921
Even when we know we're gonna
spend the rest of our lives

585
01:10:10,945 --> 01:10:12,469
in a tiny little cage,

586
01:10:12,556 --> 01:10:16,037
we will fight to stay alive.

587
01:10:19,780 --> 01:10:21,826
I always used to wonder
why people did that,

588
01:10:24,089 --> 01:10:26,613
when I watched true crime shows.

589
01:10:31,096 --> 01:10:33,185
Thought I'd be
like Gary Gilmore.

590
01:10:35,927 --> 01:10:37,320
Who's Gary Gilmore?

591
01:10:39,539 --> 01:10:41,672
He asked for the firing squad.

592
01:10:44,327 --> 01:10:45,458
I thought I'd...

593
01:10:48,200 --> 01:10:49,419
I'd do that...

594
01:10:51,072 --> 01:10:52,944
if it came to this.

595
01:10:56,600 --> 01:10:59,516
Now I just want

596
01:10:59,603 --> 01:11:03,998
three hots and a cot.

597
01:11:04,085 --> 01:11:06,262
I didn't plan to do it, man.

598
01:11:10,657 --> 01:11:11,876
Love...

599
01:11:14,008 --> 01:11:16,359
doesn't have to be something
that develops.

600
01:11:21,102 --> 01:11:26,282
The purest, most primal kind
can hit you like a wave...

601
01:11:28,109 --> 01:11:29,285
In a moment...

602
01:11:32,070 --> 01:11:33,985
or over the course of one night.

603
01:11:37,380 --> 01:11:38,574
I felt that for you

604
01:11:38,598 --> 01:11:40,992
when you had your hand
around my throat.

605
01:11:43,951 --> 01:11:45,126
Did you feel it for me?

606
01:11:51,698 --> 01:11:53,526
<i>♪ Love hurts</i>

607
01:11:56,660 --> 01:11:58,836

That's our song now.

611
01:12:20,248 --> 01:12:22,555
You'll always think of me
when you hear it.

612
01:12:28,256 --> 01:12:29,257
Maybe.

613
01:12:32,086 --> 01:12:33,131
Not...

614
01:12:34,611 --> 01:12:35,611
maybe.

615
01:12:41,835 --> 01:12:43,315
God! Fuck!

616
01:13:55,561 --> 01:13:58,216

RC!

632
01:16:52,129 --> 01:16:54,218
RC, are you in here?

633
01:17:17,937 --> 01:17:20,505
What the fuck happened in here?

634
01:17:25,858 --> 01:17:27,096
Maybe you shouldn't
touch him.

635
01:17:27,120 --> 01:17:28,600
- I know what I'm doing.
- Okay.

636
01:17:30,689 --> 01:17:32,735
It's all right.
It's all right.

637
01:17:34,388 --> 01:17:36,739
- He's dead.
- Yeah, no shit. So is he.

638
01:17:37,783 --> 01:17:38,958
It's okay.

639
01:17:39,045 --> 01:17:40,965
All right? Take it easy.
I'm gonna get these off.

640
01:17:41,047 --> 01:17:42,309
What happened here?

641
01:17:42,396 --> 01:17:44,355
What do you think happened,
Pete? Look at her!

642
01:17:45,399 --> 01:17:48,098
Here we go. Okay. It's okay.

643
01:17:49,360 --> 01:17:50,796
- Here we go.
- Goddamn it!

644
01:17:50,883 --> 01:17:53,538
Take it easy.
Okay, take it easy.

645
01:17:53,625 --> 01:17:56,933
There's a gunshot wound
to the left shoulder.

646
01:17:57,020 --> 01:17:59,196
Just take it easy, honey.
How tender is it?

647
01:17:59,283 --> 01:18:02,199
Can I move it just a little
to get the cuffs off?

648
01:18:02,286 --> 01:18:04,941
Wait. We need to figure out
what's going on here first.

649
01:18:05,028 --> 01:18:06,986
She needs medical attention now.
That's protocol.

650
01:18:07,073 --> 01:18:08,727
Protocol is that we call it in.

651
01:18:08,814 --> 01:18:09,989
Leave her be,

652
01:18:10,076 --> 01:18:12,949
and we wait for the EMTs
and Homicide to show up.

653
01:18:13,036 --> 01:18:15,168
We both know medics won't be here
for at least an hour.

654
01:18:15,255 --> 01:18:16,996
It's okay.
I'm gonna get you out.

655
01:18:17,083 --> 01:18:18,128
Okay.

656
01:18:18,215 --> 01:18:20,608
It was horrible.

657
01:18:21,827 --> 01:18:23,960
He was coked up out of his mind.

658
01:18:24,047 --> 01:18:26,310
I thought he was a nice guy.

659
01:18:26,397 --> 01:18:27,877
Who was coked out of his mind?

660
01:18:30,314 --> 01:18:32,925
His jacket pocket.

661
01:18:33,012 --> 01:18:35,275
It's okay, honey,
you don't need to do this now.

662
01:18:35,362 --> 01:18:37,800
He brought me here.
He thought it was deserted.

663
01:18:37,887 --> 01:18:41,107
And then this guy
stopped him and...

664
01:18:41,194 --> 01:18:43,631
It's okay, honey.

665
01:18:43,719 --> 01:18:45,242
Why is his neck like that?

666
01:18:45,329 --> 01:18:47,940
She was chained to this thing
the whole fucking time, Pete.

667
01:18:48,027 --> 01:18:49,307
She fought for her fucking life!

668
01:18:49,376 --> 01:18:50,656
What else was she
supposed to do?

669
01:18:50,682 --> 01:18:52,858
- Fuck! Fuck you!
- Hey, hey, hey!

670
01:18:52,945 --> 01:18:55,208
- Hey, it's okay.
- Okay, okay. All right. Okay.

671
01:18:55,295 --> 01:18:57,820
All right. Hey, calm down, lady.

672
01:18:57,907 --> 01:18:59,560
We're gonna take care of it.

673
01:18:59,647 --> 01:19:01,127
I'm going to the car
and call it in,

674
01:19:01,214 --> 01:19:02,955
and then we'll wait here
for the EMTs.

675
01:19:03,042 --> 01:19:05,392
The victim needs
medical attention.

676
01:19:05,479 --> 01:19:08,308
Our job is to do what we need to do
to keep her alive.

677
01:19:08,395 --> 01:19:10,180
This ain't my first
jar of pickles.

678
01:19:10,267 --> 01:19:11,853
And just because I have
a vagina doesn't mean

679
01:19:11,877 --> 01:19:14,010
you shouldn't listen to
a fucking thing I have to say!

680
01:19:14,097 --> 01:19:16,316
This has nothing to do
with your vagina

681
01:19:16,403 --> 01:19:18,666
and everything to do with
the diapers you were wearing

682
01:19:18,754 --> 01:19:21,408
when I cleared
my first crime scene.

683
01:19:21,495 --> 01:19:23,846
We don't even know
if she's a victim yet.

684
01:19:23,933 --> 01:19:25,369
We need to find that out first.

685
01:19:25,456 --> 01:19:27,066
That's fucking protocol.

686
01:19:30,461 --> 01:19:31,741
You wanna be held
liable for this

687
01:19:31,810 --> 01:19:33,638
or you want to help me move her?

688
01:19:34,291 --> 01:19:35,553
Pete!

689
01:19:35,640 --> 01:19:37,555
Okay, I'll help you move her.

690
01:19:43,387 --> 01:19:44,910
It's all right, honey.

691
01:19:44,997 --> 01:19:46,259
Just breathe.

692
01:19:52,962 --> 01:19:54,180
What the fuck?

693
01:20:00,752 --> 01:20:03,755
A lady came, she killed us.

694
01:20:05,061 --> 01:20:06,627
Calm down, ma'am.

695
01:20:06,714 --> 01:20:08,847
- She killed us!
- Who did what?

696
01:20:14,679 --> 01:20:17,508
Hand over the guns now,
or the chick cop dies.

697
01:20:19,118 --> 01:20:20,467
And trust me, honey,

698
01:20:20,554 --> 01:20:22,382
I don't wanna fucking kill you,

699
01:20:22,469 --> 01:20:24,210
especially after
what you did for me.

700
01:20:24,297 --> 01:20:26,038
God-fucking-damnit.

701
01:20:27,300 --> 01:20:28,736
You dumb bitch.

702
01:20:30,216 --> 01:20:31,846
- I oughta let her...
- Oh, no, you oughtn't,

703
01:20:31,870 --> 01:20:34,438
'cause if she goes,
you go too, motherfucker.

704
01:20:34,525 --> 01:20:36,962
I am in survival mode now.

705
01:20:37,049 --> 01:20:38,181
My rules are out the window.

706
01:20:38,268 --> 01:20:40,313
Honey,
just turn yourself in now...

707
01:20:40,400 --> 01:20:41,837
Just shut up

708
01:20:42,750 --> 01:20:44,274
and give me the guns.

709
01:20:53,674 --> 01:20:55,024
Put it in my lap.

710
01:21:03,467 --> 01:21:06,426
Pete, you keep your hands
on the wheel at all times.

711
01:21:06,513 --> 01:21:08,907
If a fucking finger moves,
I pull the trigger.

712
01:21:08,994 --> 01:21:10,039
You got me?

713
01:21:10,996 --> 01:21:12,215
- Yes, ma'am.
- Okay.

714
01:21:13,346 --> 01:21:15,348
- Get out of the car.
- Honey...

715
01:21:15,435 --> 01:21:17,742
Just turn yourself in now
and stop.

716
01:21:17,829 --> 01:21:19,135
It'll end better for you.

717
01:21:19,222 --> 01:21:20,222
Bitch!

718
01:21:21,050 --> 01:21:24,183
I am The Electric Lady.

719
01:21:26,185 --> 01:21:27,534
