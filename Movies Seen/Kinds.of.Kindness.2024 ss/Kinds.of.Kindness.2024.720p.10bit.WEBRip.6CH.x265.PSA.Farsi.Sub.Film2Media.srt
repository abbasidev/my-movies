00:01:50,493 --> 00:01:51,527
Come on in.

14
00:01:53,163 --> 00:01:54,833
Yes, he just arrived.

15
00:01:57,633 --> 00:02:01,465
He is wearing beige pants,
brown leather derby lace ups,

16
00:02:01,601 --> 00:02:04,430
a white shirt
with what must be his initials on it.

17
00:02:04,566 --> 00:02:05,566
B.M.F.?

18
00:02:06,262 --> 00:02:08,263
No, I'm sorry, R.M.F.

19
00:02:10,094 --> 00:02:12,397
No, I'm not short-sighted,
Raymond, it's just that

20
00:02:12,532 --> 00:02:15,230
the R is badly embroidered
and it looks like a B.

21
00:02:18,299 --> 00:02:20,998
No, his shirt's ironed
just fine.

22
00:02:21,134 --> 00:02:22,173
Would you like me
to take a photo

23
00:02:22,197 --> 00:02:23,593
and send it for you to see?

24
00:02:38,164 --> 00:02:40,461
Yes, I told you, it's fine.

25
00:02:43,732 --> 00:02:46,296
Okay. Okay.

26
00:02:49,134 --> 00:02:50,206
Raymond,
the note that you left me

27
00:02:50,230 --> 00:02:52,495
this morning was perfect.

28
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:56,398
I'm going to water the plants
and then...

29
00:02:56,534 --> 00:02:59,496
I think I might practice
playing the song on the piano.

30
00:03:00,699 --> 00:03:03,527
It's been so long since I last
practiced playing the piano.

31
00:04:26,263 --> 00:04:28,362
Does it hurt anywhere else?

32
00:04:29,426 --> 00:04:31,296
My arm hurts.

33
00:04:31,897 --> 00:04:33,527
Probably broken.

34
00:04:34,725 --> 00:04:35,765
I think you should take me

35
00:04:35,793 --> 00:04:37,991
to the nearest hospital
right away.

36
00:04:38,127 --> 00:04:41,691
I... I should definitely be
examined by a doctor.

37
00:04:41,827 --> 00:04:43,590
It's probably best
they keep me in

38
00:04:43,726 --> 00:04:45,626
for a few days
for observation.

39
00:04:47,093 --> 00:04:48,709
There might be some sort of
internal bleeding

40
00:04:48,733 --> 00:04:49,733
or something.

41
00:04:50,666 --> 00:04:51,892
Don't worry,

42
00:04:52,028 --> 00:04:53,948
they'll check you for
everything at the hospital.

43
00:06:33,592 --> 00:06:34,764
Good morning, darling.

44
00:06:34,899 --> 00:06:36,128
Good morning.

45
00:06:36,263 --> 00:06:38,131
You got in late last night.

46
00:06:39,167 --> 00:06:41,324
Sorry, I was asleep
before 11:00.

47
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:42,694
It's fine.

48
00:06:42,830 --> 00:06:45,527
I got held up at the office,
that's why I was late.

49
00:06:48,095 --> 00:06:49,362
Hmm.

50
00:06:50,728 --> 00:06:52,999
What happened
to your forehead?

51
00:06:53,134 --> 00:06:55,223
It's nothing.
There was an accident

52
00:06:55,359 --> 00:06:57,991
on the drive home last night,
but it's nothing serious.

53
00:06:58,126 --> 00:07:00,229
What do you mean?
Shouldn't you see a doctor?

54
00:07:00,365 --> 00:07:02,758
I went by the hospital
last night,

55
00:07:02,893 --> 00:07:06,131
but they assured me
it's nothing that, um...

56
00:07:06,267 --> 00:07:07,791
They just gave me
some tranquilizers.

57
00:07:07,927 --> 00:07:09,367
Robert,
you should've called.

58
00:07:09,397 --> 00:07:12,024
You went to the hospital
on your own?

59
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:15,461
It was nothing.
There's no need to worry.

60
00:07:24,032 --> 00:07:25,631
Raymond sent it yesterday.

61
00:07:25,767 --> 00:07:26,890
He is such a sweet man.

62
00:07:27,026 --> 00:07:28,823
I don't know how
we can ever repay him

63
00:07:28,959 --> 00:07:30,990
after everything
he's done for us.

64
00:07:31,126 --> 00:07:34,724
A genuine smashed
McEnroe racket from 1984.

65
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:36,798
It must have cost him
a fortune.

66
00:07:36,933 --> 00:07:38,060
Isn't it wonderful, Robert?

67
00:07:38,196 --> 00:07:39,628
Yes, it's wonderful.

68
00:07:40,798 --> 00:07:43,858
Give Raymond a kiss for me.
I'll give him a call, too.

69
00:07:43,993 --> 00:07:45,508
I rang him just now,
but he didn't pick up

70
00:07:45,532 --> 00:07:46,908
and I didn't want
to call again right away,

71
00:07:46,932 --> 00:07:48,390
in case I woke him.

72
00:07:48,526 --> 00:07:49,760
Sure, I'll do that.

73
00:07:49,896 --> 00:07:52,356
Tell him it's the nicest thing
he's ever given us.

74
00:07:52,492 --> 00:07:53,758
I'll tell him.

75
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:07,330
<i>"Tomorrow, Wednesday,

86

87
00:08:31,532 --> 00:08:33,106
<i>Good morning, Robert.</i>

88
00:08:33,130 --> 00:08:35,499
Good morning, Louise.

90
00:08:38,165 --> 00:08:40,164
<i>Three o'clock, in his office.</i>

91
00:08:41,828 --> 00:08:43,135
<i>Uh,
I might need to pass by</i>

92
00:08:43,159 --> 00:08:44,792
<i>the construction site

93
00:08:44,927 --> 00:08:46,999
<i>I might not make it
back in time.</i>

94
00:08:48,432 --> 00:08:49,904
<i>If I were you,
I wouldn't pass by</i>

95
00:08:49,928 --> 00:08:51,496
<i>the construction site

96
00:08:51,631 --> 00:08:54,758
<i>Mr. Frischmann wants to
see you in his office at 3:00.</i>

97
00:08:56,460 --> 00:08:59,593
<i>All right, then, Louise.
Thank you. Bye.</i>

98
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,130
Hi. Can I go in,
or is he busy?

99
00:09:07,265 --> 00:09:09,362
He's just on the phone.
Won't be long.

100
00:09:20,102 --> 00:09:21,760
Have I ever shown you
my son?

101
00:09:21,896 --> 00:09:23,098
No.

102
00:09:31,799 --> 00:09:32,799
He's adorable.

103
00:09:32,868 --> 00:09:35,164
- Isn't he?
- He really is.

104
00:09:37,293 --> 00:09:39,995
Aren't you and Sarah
thinking of having children?

105
00:09:40,131 --> 00:09:41,296
Sarah can't have children.

106
00:09:41,431 --> 00:09:43,524
She has this issue
with her ovaries.

107
00:09:43,660 --> 00:09:45,027
Sorry, I had no idea.

108
00:09:45,162 --> 00:09:46,162
That's all right.

109
00:10:01,064 --> 00:10:02,195
Good afternoon, Robert.

110
00:10:02,330 --> 00:10:03,797
Don't just stand there,
sit down.

111
00:10:03,932 --> 00:10:05,028
Were you waiting long?

112
00:10:05,163 --> 00:10:06,429
No, 15 minutes or so.

113
00:10:06,564 --> 00:10:09,199
Hey,
your hair's nice like that.

114
00:10:09,334 --> 00:10:11,134
Don't get it cut,
let it grow a little longer.

115
00:10:11,266 --> 00:10:13,661
And you've lost more weight,
I think.

116
00:10:13,797 --> 00:10:18,333
Skinny men are the most
ridiculous thing there is.

117
00:10:18,468 --> 00:10:21,797
We've gone over this before,
you must put on a few pounds.

118
00:10:21,933 --> 00:10:23,462
I told you that last time.

119
00:10:23,597 --> 00:10:25,830
- But I have.
- You most certainly have not.

120
00:10:25,966 --> 00:10:27,757
You're even skinnier now.

121
00:10:27,892 --> 00:10:30,229
We'll have to take
another look

122
00:10:30,365 --> 00:10:32,296
at your eating plan
for the week.

123
00:10:34,231 --> 00:10:36,200
Did you read <i>Anna Karenina?</i>

124
00:10:36,335 --> 00:10:38,560
I'm just finishing it off.
There's a few pages left.

125
00:10:39,226 --> 00:10:40,230
Sit.

126
00:10:41,901 --> 00:10:43,626
Will you have something
to drink?

127
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:46,362
I would love a vodka.

128
00:10:49,926 --> 00:10:52,194
I will be joining you
after all,

129
00:10:52,330 --> 00:10:55,262
for, uh, your trip to Munich.

130
00:10:55,398 --> 00:10:57,038
I reckon I can make it.
They won't need me

131
00:10:57,093 --> 00:11:00,062
at the construction site here
next week anyway.

132
00:11:00,198 --> 00:11:02,329
Sarah might be joining us too.

133
00:11:03,263 --> 00:11:05,560
If you don't mind, that is.

134
00:11:06,827 --> 00:11:08,457
Also, maybe
she told you already,

135
00:11:08,593 --> 00:11:10,562
but she loved the racket.

136
00:11:10,697 --> 00:11:13,328
Said it was the best gift
you've ever given us.

137
00:11:13,463 --> 00:11:15,626
That's great.
You know what?

138
00:11:16,329 --> 00:11:18,858
I didn't pour you a vodka.

139
00:11:18,994 --> 00:11:21,560
I think a whiskey now
would be much better.

140
00:11:22,828 --> 00:11:25,131
Yes, right,
a whiskey is much better.

141
00:11:28,431 --> 00:11:30,356
Raymond,
I'm sorry about yesterday.

142
00:11:30,491 --> 00:11:32,098
Truly sorry.

143
00:11:41,097 --> 00:11:42,798
What did you do today?

144
00:11:42,933 --> 00:11:44,890
I woke up at 7:30, showered,

145
00:11:45,025 --> 00:11:47,329
didn't wash my hair,
and then drank my juice.

146
00:11:47,464 --> 00:11:49,725
- Orange and lemon?
- Orange and lemon.

147
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:51,932
Did you and Sarah
fuck this morning?

148
00:11:52,067 --> 00:11:54,228
At 8:30,
right after breakfast.

149
00:11:54,364 --> 00:11:57,290
Very good.
I spoke with Sarah

150
00:11:57,425 --> 00:11:59,232
an hour ago.

151
00:11:59,368 --> 00:12:02,757
And yes, she did say
she liked the gift very much.

152
00:12:02,892 --> 00:12:05,061
Yes, she said
it was the nicest thing

153
00:12:05,196 --> 00:12:06,196
you've ever given us.

154
00:12:06,265 --> 00:12:08,163
She liked it
more than Ayrton Senna's

155
00:12:08,299 --> 00:12:11,023
- scorched racing helmet?
- Oh, much more.

156
00:12:12,026 --> 00:12:14,190
- Thank you so much.
- Oh, no, thank you.

157
00:12:14,326 --> 00:12:18,197
You deserve all these things.
It's the least I can do.

158
00:12:19,897 --> 00:12:21,197
Raymond...

159
00:12:22,699 --> 00:12:26,592
sorry again about yesterday.
I don't know what went wrong.

160
00:12:26,728 --> 00:12:28,527
I should have
been hospitalized.

161
00:12:28,663 --> 00:12:30,857
The doctor just couldn't
be trusted, he must...

162
00:12:30,992 --> 00:12:32,392
The doctor who saw you
is excellent,

163
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:35,891
he's a friend of mine.
And I spoke with him earlier

164
00:12:36,026 --> 00:12:38,532
and he said
that there was really no need

165
00:12:38,668 --> 00:12:39,866
to have you hospitalized

166
00:12:40,002 --> 00:12:41,362
for a scratch
on your forehead.

167
00:12:41,931 --> 00:12:43,461
My back hurts.

168
00:12:45,459 --> 00:12:47,163
Here and here.

169
00:12:47,299 --> 00:12:49,093
Robert, listen.
It doesn't matter.

170
00:12:49,229 --> 00:12:50,894
These things happen.

171
00:12:51,030 --> 00:12:52,299
And anyway...

172
00:12:52,434 --> 00:12:55,023
I'm going to give you
a chance to make it up to me.

173
00:12:55,726 --> 00:12:57,324
We're going to
repeat the crash

174
00:12:57,459 --> 00:12:58,658
two days from now,

175
00:12:58,794 --> 00:13:00,457
and this time
you can do it right.

176
00:13:00,592 --> 00:13:02,565
Same place, same time,

177
00:13:02,701 --> 00:13:05,661
same midnight blue BMW.

178
00:13:06,864 --> 00:13:11,999
Ram into him at a higher speed
and everything will be fine.

179
00:13:13,035 --> 00:13:15,224
I can't crash
any faster, Raymond.

180
00:13:15,359 --> 00:13:16,359
Robert...

181
00:13:16,491 --> 00:13:17,523
in two days,

182
00:13:17,659 --> 00:13:19,265
it'll be happening again,

183
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:21,732
and you'll see to it
that you're driving faster.

184
00:13:24,599 --> 00:13:27,623
- I don't think I can do that.
- Really now, Robert...

185
00:13:27,758 --> 00:13:29,362
I don't have time for this.

186
00:13:32,167 --> 00:13:34,963
You have two hours
to think it over.

187
00:13:35,099 --> 00:13:37,563
Go to Cheval, sit at the bar.

188
00:13:38,366 --> 00:13:39,830
<i>Ask them
to bring you a drink,</i>

189
00:13:39,965 --> 00:13:41,330
<i>something nonalcoholic</i>

190
00:13:41,465 --> 00:13:43,591
<i>so it doesn't
cloud your judgment.</i>

191
00:13:43,726 --> 00:13:45,825
<i>Then come by my house tonight</i>

192
00:13:45,961 --> 00:13:47,994
<i>and let me know
what you've decided.</i>

193
00:13:48,129 --> 00:13:49,597
Good evening, sir.

194
00:13:49,733 --> 00:13:50,858
Good evening.

195
00:13:58,196 --> 00:13:59,725
What can I get you?

196
00:14:00,860 --> 00:14:02,490
I'd like a double
Johnnie Walker Red

197
00:14:02,625 --> 00:14:03,725
on the rocks, please.

198
00:14:07,365 --> 00:14:08,765
Just kidding.
A Virgin Mary, please.

199
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:10,230
Right away, sir.

200
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:15,065
That was quick.

201
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:16,500
Enjoy.

202
00:14:49,095 --> 00:14:50,329
Hey, Robert.

203
00:14:53,928 --> 00:14:56,199
Sorry, Robert. Vivian and I
were just having

204
00:14:56,334 --> 00:14:58,999
a very interesting
conversation about palm trees,

205
00:14:59,135 --> 00:15:00,757
so I'll be with you
in just a moment.

206
00:15:00,893 --> 00:15:04,032
Uh, so,
tell me about that weevil.

207
00:15:05,326 --> 00:15:07,263
Yes. So...

208
00:15:07,398 --> 00:15:09,490
there's this weevil
that's destroying them.

209
00:15:09,626 --> 00:15:10,730
It's carried on the wind.

210
00:15:10,865 --> 00:15:12,757
So, it has wings?

211
00:15:12,893 --> 00:15:14,866
Or it's very light,
I don't know.

212
00:15:15,002 --> 00:15:16,928
And it only attacks
palm trees.

213
00:15:17,063 --> 00:15:18,263
<i>And so now...</i>

214
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:20,066
it's illegal to buy or sell
palm trees

215
00:15:20,202 --> 00:15:22,399
in various places
across Europe and Africa.

216
00:15:22,534 --> 00:15:25,862
<i>Which means that you can't
just walk into a nursery</i>

217
00:15:25,998 --> 00:15:27,098
and buy a palm tree,

218
00:15:27,234 --> 00:15:30,157
because they're banned
because of this weevil.

219
00:15:30,292 --> 00:15:32,965
So, now they're bought
and sold on the black market.

220
00:15:33,101 --> 00:15:36,094
And this weevil
only attacks palm trees?

221
00:15:36,229 --> 00:15:38,725
Yes. Only palm trees.

222
00:15:39,632 --> 00:15:40,632
Okay.

223
00:15:42,198 --> 00:15:45,296
That is really amazing.

224
00:15:50,397 --> 00:15:52,197
I'll leave you two
alone now.

225
00:15:52,996 --> 00:15:54,658
Amazing, eh?

226
00:15:54,794 --> 00:15:56,527
- Really amazing.
- Huh.

227
00:15:58,064 --> 00:15:59,428
Right then, Robert.

228
00:16:02,733 --> 00:16:03,758
I'm all ears.

229
00:16:04,533 --> 00:16:05,533
Yes.

230
00:16:06,827 --> 00:16:10,792
Raymond, I've given this
a lot of thought,

231
00:16:10,927 --> 00:16:13,362
and I can't do
what you're asking me to do.

232
00:16:13,497 --> 00:16:15,829
Again. You come in
and sit down there

233
00:16:15,964 --> 00:16:17,296
before you speak.

234
00:16:19,497 --> 00:16:21,363
- Raymond.
- I want you to come in

235
00:16:21,499 --> 00:16:24,362
and sit down there
before you speak. Vivian.

236
00:16:34,934 --> 00:16:36,494
I'll leave you two alone now.

237
00:16:40,566 --> 00:16:42,442
- Raymond, I've thought...
- And, actually,

238
00:16:42,466 --> 00:16:44,862
it was better when you said it
standing up, so...

239
00:16:44,998 --> 00:16:46,625
go out and come back in.

240
00:16:46,761 --> 00:16:48,658
Do it by yourself.
Without Vivian.

241
00:16:48,794 --> 00:16:51,164
Raymond, please.

242
00:16:59,229 --> 00:17:02,162
Raymond, I can't do

243
00:17:02,297 --> 00:17:04,527
what you asked me to do.
I'm sorry.

244
00:17:05,966 --> 00:17:09,100
Anything else you want, yes.

245
00:17:09,235 --> 00:17:11,390
But that one thing,
it's just too frightening.

246
00:17:11,526 --> 00:17:13,624
If I crash any faster...

247
00:17:13,759 --> 00:17:15,222
the other driver
might be killed.

248
00:17:15,358 --> 00:17:16,823
Yes.

249
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:19,198
I know
what might happen, Robert.

250
00:17:20,101 --> 00:17:21,897
And the driver
of the other vehicle

251
00:17:22,033 --> 00:17:24,424
is fine with losing his life,

252
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:26,060
he's agreed to it in fact,

253
00:17:26,196 --> 00:17:28,099
so there's really no

254
00:17:28,234 --> 00:17:31,626
need for you
to worry about that. If you...

255
00:17:32,827 --> 00:17:34,626
really don't want to
disappoint me...

256
00:17:35,666 --> 00:17:36,930
that is, Robert.

257
00:17:37,066 --> 00:17:41,593
If you truly love me, I mean.

258
00:17:43,998 --> 00:17:45,224
What you're asking,

259
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:46,592
it's too much.

260
00:17:46,728 --> 00:17:49,061
I love you, Raymond,
I love you.

261
00:17:49,196 --> 00:17:50,923
But this is too much.

262
00:17:51,059 --> 00:17:54,230
No, no, no.
You don't love me at all.

263
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:58,230
I can feel it.
This isn't love.

264
00:17:58,965 --> 00:18:00,099
I don't know what it is,

265
00:18:00,234 --> 00:18:03,032
but it's clearly not love.
But, no matter.

266
00:18:04,465 --> 00:18:06,725
I knew this day would come.
It's fine.

267
00:18:07,993 --> 00:18:10,098
Ten years it lasted.

268
00:18:11,229 --> 00:18:12,795
That's not nothing.

269
00:18:12,930 --> 00:18:14,495
The truth is...

270
00:18:14,631 --> 00:18:18,032
I expected you
to tire of it all far sooner.

271
00:18:20,035 --> 00:18:22,023
Can I just
say something?

272
00:18:22,159 --> 00:18:23,770
This doesn't have
anything to do with love.

273
00:18:23,794 --> 00:18:25,832
Right then, Robert,
you're free now.

274
00:18:25,967 --> 00:18:28,058
You can go on your way.
Tonight,

275
00:18:28,193 --> 00:18:32,132
tomorrow, and every day
from now on, you're free to

276
00:18:32,267 --> 00:18:34,933
sleep whenever you like,
fuck whenever you like.

277
00:18:35,068 --> 00:18:37,524
Have however many children
you like.

278
00:18:37,660 --> 00:18:39,362
Wear whatever socks you like.

279
00:18:39,963 --> 00:18:42,032
Raymond, please.

280
00:18:43,725 --> 00:18:45,758
I never denied you anything.

281
00:18:47,659 --> 00:18:49,197
Even when you asked me...

282
00:18:50,761 --> 00:18:53,099
told me not to have
any children.

283
00:18:53,234 --> 00:18:55,264
I wasn't happy about it,
but I didn't say a word.

284
00:18:55,399 --> 00:18:58,430
Ask me for anything else
you want and I'll do it.

285
00:18:58,565 --> 00:19:00,730
But I can't be responsible

286
00:19:00,866 --> 00:19:02,329
for another man's death.

287
00:19:05,030 --> 00:19:06,362
I'm tired, Robert.

288
00:19:07,894 --> 00:19:11,364
You don't have to give me
anything back.

289
00:19:11,499 --> 00:19:13,831
You can stay in the house
you've been living in

290
00:19:13,966 --> 00:19:15,527
and keep the car of course.

291
00:19:17,633 --> 00:19:18,659
Goodbye, Robert.

292
00:20:41,165 --> 00:20:42,593
They took the racket.

293
00:20:43,931 --> 00:20:45,230
What did you say?

294
00:20:46,363 --> 00:20:47,929
Raymond came in
during the night

295
00:20:48,064 --> 00:20:49,489
while we were sleeping

296
00:20:49,625 --> 00:20:51,131
and took the racket.

297
00:20:57,659 --> 00:20:58,724
That's so strange.

298
00:20:58,860 --> 00:21:00,428
Who could have
taken the racket?

299
00:21:03,526 --> 00:21:05,230
The alarm didn't go off.

300
00:21:07,130 --> 00:21:08,130
I'm calling the police.

301
00:21:08,266 --> 00:21:11,529
Raymond knows
the code, darling.

302
00:21:13,568 --> 00:21:14,692
<i>To be precise,</i>

303
00:21:14,828 --> 00:21:16,127
<i>he picked the code
out himself.</i>

304
00:21:16,263 --> 00:21:17,626
<i>You didn't know that.</i>

305
00:21:19,626 --> 00:21:22,527
1962. The year he was born.

306
00:21:23,426 --> 00:21:24,830
And there's more.

307
00:21:24,966 --> 00:21:28,592
The two of us are together

308
00:21:28,728 --> 00:21:31,162
because that's what
he decided.

309
00:21:33,725 --> 00:21:35,491
<i>That night in Cheval,</i>

310
00:21:35,627 --> 00:21:37,758
<i>he picked you out for me.</i>

311
00:21:37,893 --> 00:21:40,760
He saw you
sitting there on your own

312
00:21:40,895 --> 00:21:42,697
and he told me to go over
and flirt with you.

313
00:21:42,833 --> 00:21:44,562
I liked you a lot too...

314
00:21:44,698 --> 00:21:48,329
<i>don't get me wrong,
but he made me do it.</i>

315
00:21:50,093 --> 00:21:52,598
<i>He suggested I make it
seem like an accident,</i>

316
00:21:52,733 --> 00:21:56,491
<i>told me to pretend I'd hurt
my hand to get us talking.</i>

317
00:21:56,626 --> 00:21:58,996
<i>The notes in the flowers</i>

318
00:21:59,131 --> 00:22:01,062
I sent you, he wrote those.

319
00:22:01,198 --> 00:22:02,763
<i>He picked out this house,</i>

320
00:22:02,898 --> 00:22:03,999
<i>these stools,</i>

321
00:22:04,134 --> 00:22:05,824
- he picked out this robe...
- Robert,

322
00:22:05,959 --> 00:22:07,665
you need to be
heading to the office.

323
00:22:07,801 --> 00:22:08,999
I'm not done yet.

324
00:22:09,767 --> 00:22:11,725
There's one last thing.

325
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,131
<i>I never told you this before.</i>

326
00:22:15,801 --> 00:22:17,957
<i>And it's terrible...</i>

327
00:22:18,092 --> 00:22:20,131
what I'm about to tell you,
I know that...

328
00:22:21,659 --> 00:22:23,957
<i>but you need to hear it.</i>

329
00:22:24,093 --> 00:22:26,697
<i>The reason we never
managed to have a child</i>

330
00:22:26,833 --> 00:22:27,864
<i>all these years,</i>

331
00:22:27,999 --> 00:22:31,626
is not because you couldn't.

332
00:22:32,733 --> 00:22:33,757
<i>It's because...</i>

333
00:22:33,893 --> 00:22:38,691
it's because
Raymond was secretly

334
00:22:38,827 --> 00:22:41,999
paying doctors
to mess things up.

335
00:22:44,535 --> 00:22:48,395
<i>Those weren't miscarriages,
Sarah, they were abortions.</i>

336
00:23:10,333 --> 00:23:12,013
<i>The wireless
customer you called</i>

337
00:23:12,098 --> 00:23:13,999
<i>is not available at this time.</i>

338
00:23:51,731 --> 00:23:52,758
Sarah.

339
00:24:06,731 --> 00:24:08,065
Sarah.

340
00:24:36,228 --> 00:24:38,668
<i>The wireless customer
you called is not available...</i>

341
00:24:49,893 --> 00:24:51,462
Okay, safely.
Safely. Safely.

342
00:24:51,598 --> 00:24:54,028
Remember, it's not a race.

343
00:24:54,163 --> 00:24:56,732
All right. Great job.

344
00:24:56,867 --> 00:24:58,527
Kick. Don't forget to kick.

345
00:24:59,163 --> 00:25:01,725
Very good. Very good.

346
00:25:03,392 --> 00:25:04,392
All right.

347
00:25:04,464 --> 00:25:05,837
Yeah, get your kickboard
if you need it.

348
00:25:05,861 --> 00:25:08,391
Robert, I haven't seen you
in so long.

349
00:25:08,526 --> 00:25:09,758
Have you lost weight?

350
00:25:10,734 --> 00:25:12,529
Will, is Sarah around?

351
00:25:12,664 --> 00:25:16,498
Sarah quit. This morning.
Over the phone too.

352
00:25:16,634 --> 00:25:19,032
Ah, she quit.

353
00:25:19,167 --> 00:25:21,132
She did tell me
she was planning to,

354
00:25:21,267 --> 00:25:23,691
but I've had so much work
recently, Will,

355
00:25:23,827 --> 00:25:25,764
you can't imagine
how much work,

356
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:26,966
and I forgot all about it.

357
00:25:27,101 --> 00:25:28,498
I did ask
if it was health-related,

358
00:25:28,634 --> 00:25:31,960
but she said no.
I just, I hope it's nothing serious.

359
00:25:32,095 --> 00:25:33,131
No, no, she just

360
00:25:33,267 --> 00:25:36,091
tired herself out lately,
that's all.

361
00:25:36,226 --> 00:25:38,361
I'm sure you'll have
a great time in Munich.

362
00:25:38,497 --> 00:25:40,069
Why don't you stay there
a few extra days?

363
00:25:40,093 --> 00:25:42,013
I'm sure things will be better
when you get back.

364
00:25:42,262 --> 00:25:43,692
When are you flying out?

365
00:25:44,559 --> 00:25:45,626
In a couple of days.

366
00:25:58,025 --> 00:26:00,065
- Robert.
- Where is my wife?

367
00:26:02,627 --> 00:26:03,825
Raymond isn't here right now,

368
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:05,474
and I'm getting ready
to head out myself.

369
00:26:05,498 --> 00:26:08,631
Then I'll wait for him
to get back. Sarah!

370
00:26:08,767 --> 00:26:10,032
He left for Germany.

371
00:26:12,894 --> 00:26:14,861
Is my wife with him?
Did they go together?

372
00:26:14,996 --> 00:26:16,527
Robert, get out.

373
00:26:17,926 --> 00:26:21,263
Are the three of you
fucking maybe?

374
00:26:22,364 --> 00:26:23,824
Get out of my house
right now

375
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:25,800
or I will call Raymond
and you will rue the day

376
00:26:25,926 --> 00:26:27,197
that you ever set
foot in here.

377
00:26:28,930 --> 00:26:30,692
I suggest,

378
00:26:30,828 --> 00:26:32,598
you run back home
to your mom and dad,

379
00:26:32,734 --> 00:26:34,061
while you still can.

380
00:26:34,196 --> 00:26:35,795
Because getting fucked

381
00:26:35,930 --> 00:26:38,725
by an old man like Raymond,
you deserve better than that.

382
00:26:39,927 --> 00:26:41,857
Getting fucked by an old man
like Raymond

383
00:26:41,993 --> 00:26:44,857
is, however,
exactly what you deserve.

384
00:26:44,992 --> 00:26:47,197
You're pathetic.
Get out of my sight.

385
00:27:03,931 --> 00:27:05,263
Good evening.

386
00:27:08,301 --> 00:27:10,890
This here is
Ayrton Senna's helmet.

387
00:27:11,025 --> 00:27:12,896
The blue and green
stripes symbolized

388
00:27:13,031 --> 00:27:14,496
speed and aggression,

389
00:27:14,631 --> 00:27:18,866
whereas the yellow all over
symbolized youth.

390
00:27:21,501 --> 00:27:22,527
Mmm.

391
00:27:27,266 --> 00:27:29,263
What was it
the yellow symbolized?

392
00:27:29,995 --> 00:27:30,995
Youth.

393
00:27:35,535 --> 00:27:38,397
<i>These are the shoes
worn by Michael Jordan,</i>

394
00:27:38,533 --> 00:27:41,628
in the game against
the Washington Bullets in '84

395
00:27:41,764 --> 00:27:45,663
when he led the Bulls
to a home win by 16 points.

396
00:27:45,799 --> 00:27:48,696
Hmm. $10,000.

397
00:27:48,831 --> 00:27:50,065
For what?

398
00:27:50,666 --> 00:27:51,666
For everything.

399
00:27:54,396 --> 00:27:55,628
<i>You can't be serious.</i>

400
00:27:55,764 --> 00:27:58,390
<i>That ping pong ball alone
is worth $5,000.</i>

401
00:28:04,129 --> 00:28:05,461
$12,000.

402
00:28:09,898 --> 00:28:11,626
$20,000 at least.

403
00:28:12,292 --> 00:28:13,428
$12,000.

404
00:28:19,063 --> 00:28:20,131
Yes, good morning.

405
00:28:20,267 --> 00:28:23,823
Uh, can I speak
with Mr. Smith please?

406
00:28:23,959 --> 00:28:26,164
It's Robert Fletcher.
Thank you.

407
00:28:27,301 --> 00:28:31,765
Mr. Smith, I would like to
see you if I can.

408
00:28:31,900 --> 00:28:33,362
I'd like to speak with you.

409
00:28:35,929 --> 00:28:37,131
Yes.

410
00:28:39,095 --> 00:28:42,296
No, no, tomorrow's fine.
Should I come by your office?

411
00:28:44,834 --> 00:28:46,494
In the afternoon sometime?

412
00:28:48,767 --> 00:28:50,263
Yes, that's perfect.

413
00:28:51,995 --> 00:28:52,995
Raymond?

414
00:28:53,062 --> 00:28:54,065
Raymond's well.

415
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:57,598
He's in Germany,
on a business trip.

416
00:28:59,099 --> 00:29:00,430
<i>Sarah, I'm worried.</i>

417
00:29:00,565 --> 00:29:04,029
<i>Please call to let me know
you're okay.</i>

418
00:29:04,165 --> 00:29:05,857
<i>And I have some good news.</i>

419
00:29:05,993 --> 00:29:07,959
<i>I'm meeting with
Edward Smith tomorrow.</i>

420
00:29:08,095 --> 00:29:10,461
<i>You know how much
he wants me to work for him.</i>

421
00:29:10,596 --> 00:29:14,098
<i>He'll go nuts
when I tell him I'm available.</i>

422
00:29:14,934 --> 00:29:18,098
<i>Please, Sarah, come home.</i>

423
00:29:18,700 --> 00:29:20,424
<i>I miss you.</i>

424
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:22,458
<i>I know you miss me too.</i>

425
00:29:22,594 --> 00:29:24,989
<i>I'm sorry if I upset you.</i>

426
00:29:25,692 --> 00:29:27,296
<i>I love you very much.</i>

427
00:29:27,964 --> 00:29:29,064
<i>Okay. Bye.</i>

428
00:29:35,060 --> 00:29:38,496
Excuse me, do you know
if Mr. Smith will be long?

429
00:29:38,631 --> 00:29:41,593
I'm not sure, Mr. Fletcher.
I don't imagine so.

430
00:29:42,196 --> 00:29:43,564
He's in his office?

431
00:29:43,700 --> 00:29:45,131
No, he's out.

432
00:29:47,234 --> 00:29:50,058
But he knows I'm here,
right?

433
00:29:50,193 --> 00:29:53,161
He's well aware of all
the appointments he has today.

434
00:29:53,296 --> 00:29:55,164
Don't you worry about that.

435
00:29:59,026 --> 00:30:01,062
Is that cute little boy
your son?

436
00:30:01,198 --> 00:30:03,329
My grandson.

437
00:30:05,233 --> 00:30:07,096
I don't have
any children.

438
00:30:07,231 --> 00:30:10,390
My wife had this issue,
you see,

439
00:30:10,526 --> 00:30:11,526
but she's all better now

440
00:30:11,596 --> 00:30:12,876
and we're thinking
of having one.

441
00:30:12,964 --> 00:30:14,230
That's great.

442
00:30:28,129 --> 00:30:29,329
Hello.

443
00:30:29,864 --> 00:30:32,692
Yes. Of course.

444
00:30:36,367 --> 00:30:40,197
Hmm. Mr. Fletcher,
I just spoke with Mr. Smith.

445
00:30:41,226 --> 00:30:42,226
And?

446
00:30:42,299 --> 00:30:44,396
Unfortunately
something came up

447
00:30:44,532 --> 00:30:47,730
and he won't be
coming by the office today.

448
00:30:47,866 --> 00:30:50,260
But we will be in touch

449
00:30:50,396 --> 00:30:52,299
to arrange a new appointment.

450
00:30:52,435 --> 00:30:55,928
Right.
How about I call you tomorrow?

451
00:30:56,063 --> 00:30:57,427
We'll be in touch.

452
00:31:17,167 --> 00:31:18,999
Are you ready
to order, sir?

453
00:31:20,035 --> 00:31:23,725
Um, I don't know.
I can't decide.

454
00:31:25,701 --> 00:31:27,223
I know I'm not hungry.

455
00:31:27,359 --> 00:31:30,032
That's fine, sir.
How about something to drink?

456
00:31:30,500 --> 00:31:31,500
Yes.

457
00:31:31,563 --> 00:31:33,098
There's a wine list
on the back.

458
00:31:37,128 --> 00:31:39,098
I'll have the...

459
00:31:42,859 --> 00:31:44,399
Could you recommend me
a wine?

460
00:31:44,534 --> 00:31:45,990
White? Red?

461
00:31:46,126 --> 00:31:48,562
Whatever's best.
I mean, whatever you think.

462
00:31:48,697 --> 00:31:51,156
I recommend a white Chardonnay
from New Zealand.

463
00:31:51,292 --> 00:31:52,296
Perfect.

464
00:32:20,032 --> 00:32:21,662
I slipped and hurt my hand.

465
00:32:21,797 --> 00:32:24,098
I guess someone must've
spilled water on the floor.

466
00:32:24,834 --> 00:32:26,593
It's probably just a sprain.

467
00:34:08,866 --> 00:34:10,090
Good morning, Raymond.

468
00:38:16,031 --> 00:38:18,263
- Hi.
- Hi, Rita.

469
00:38:19,832 --> 00:38:21,124
Thank you so much.

470
00:38:21,260 --> 00:38:25,395
No, no, I wanted to thank you
for everything.

471
00:38:26,864 --> 00:38:27,864
How's the foot?

472
00:38:31,492 --> 00:38:32,492
Are you all right?

473
00:38:33,030 --> 00:38:34,362
Are you hurt?

474
00:38:34,497 --> 00:38:36,630
Just a lil...
a little.

475
00:38:36,765 --> 00:38:38,098
A little?

476
00:38:38,233 --> 00:38:40,663
I missed that step.
I didn't see it.

477
00:38:40,798 --> 00:38:42,395
What step?

478
00:38:42,530 --> 00:38:46,457
There's a step
in the men's bathroom.

479
00:38:46,593 --> 00:38:47,798
Should I get you some ice?

480
00:38:47,934 --> 00:38:50,228
No, don't worry.
It's nothing.

481
00:38:50,363 --> 00:38:52,264
I wouldn't want
to trouble you.

482
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:54,932
Thank you so much, though.
You're very kind.

483
00:38:55,068 --> 00:38:56,627
That doesn't look
like nothing.

484
00:38:57,263 --> 00:38:58,565
Are you here with anyone?

485
00:38:58,700 --> 00:39:00,296
No, it's just me.

486
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:05,494
I have this
exact same car.

487
00:39:06,766 --> 00:39:07,766
Really?

488
00:39:09,066 --> 00:39:11,131
What are the chances?

489
00:39:12,700 --> 00:39:14,027
It hurts more now.

490
00:39:14,163 --> 00:39:15,163
Well, hang in there.

491
00:39:15,264 --> 00:39:16,999
We're only five minutes away.

492
00:39:19,134 --> 00:39:21,990
Have I seen you
somewhere before?

493
00:39:22,125 --> 00:39:24,295
Are you at that bar
and restaurant often?

494
00:39:24,431 --> 00:39:25,899
No, that was
my first time there.

495
00:39:31,233 --> 00:39:33,297
Are you an architect
by any chance?

496
00:39:33,433 --> 00:39:36,560
No, I work
at an opticians downtown.

497
00:39:37,591 --> 00:39:38,663
I'm Rita Fanning.

498
00:39:38,798 --> 00:39:39,898
Robert Fletcher.

499
00:39:40,033 --> 00:39:41,924
I know I've got
a lot of nerve,

500
00:39:42,059 --> 00:39:44,590
what with you
taking me to the hospital

501
00:39:44,726 --> 00:39:46,764
yesterday and all, but I have

502
00:39:46,899 --> 00:39:49,164
one more favor to ask.

503
00:39:50,525 --> 00:39:52,363
Sure, what is it?

504
00:39:52,499 --> 00:39:55,060
I want to take you out
for dinner one night.

505
00:39:55,196 --> 00:39:56,724
It's the least I can do

506
00:39:56,860 --> 00:39:59,692
and it would make me
very happy.

507
00:40:01,026 --> 00:40:03,131
- If it's not a chore.
- I'd like that.

508
00:40:03,899 --> 00:40:05,128
It would be my pleasure.

509
00:40:05,263 --> 00:40:06,692
- Really?
- Of course.

510
00:40:10,865 --> 00:40:11,865
Tomorrow evening?

511
00:40:11,964 --> 00:40:13,197
Tomorrow evening.

512
00:40:35,799 --> 00:40:38,065
Rita, it's Robert.

513
00:40:38,998 --> 00:40:40,965
Um, I hope you're okay.

514
00:40:41,101 --> 00:40:42,998
I'm outside your house
right now.

515
00:40:45,962 --> 00:40:47,731
<i>I guess you
forgot about tonight.</i>

516
00:40:47,867 --> 00:40:49,028
<i>Call me when you can.</i>

517
00:40:49,163 --> 00:40:50,593
<i>Have a nice night.</i>

518
00:41:55,095 --> 00:41:56,296
Come in.

519
00:41:59,359 --> 00:42:00,364
Hi, Rita.

520
00:42:00,500 --> 00:42:01,500
Hi.

521
00:42:03,898 --> 00:42:05,257
What happened?

522
00:42:05,392 --> 00:42:06,899
How are you?

523
00:42:07,035 --> 00:42:08,458
I'm a little worse
than you were

524
00:42:08,593 --> 00:42:10,165
that day at the restaurant.

525
00:42:11,035 --> 00:42:13,023
I'm sorry
about the other night.

526
00:42:13,159 --> 00:42:15,164
There's no need to apologize.
What happened?

527
00:42:16,101 --> 00:42:17,532
I was driving home
from work and

528
00:42:17,667 --> 00:42:21,132
I crashed into another vehicle at
an intersection and...

529
00:42:22,068 --> 00:42:24,094
I don't remember
anything after that.

530
00:42:24,230 --> 00:42:25,659
I woke up and I was here.

531
00:42:27,263 --> 00:42:29,027
What kind of vehicle was it?

532
00:42:29,163 --> 00:42:31,932
A blue BMW I think.

533
00:42:33,867 --> 00:42:35,524
What about the other driver?

534
00:42:35,659 --> 00:42:37,362
The other driver was a man.

535
00:42:38,431 --> 00:42:39,863
I don't know,
after a certain point

536
00:42:39,999 --> 00:42:41,396
I don't remember a thing.

537
00:42:41,932 --> 00:42:44,994
I mean, is he alive?

538
00:42:45,130 --> 00:42:46,297
He's in pretty bad shape

539
00:42:46,432 --> 00:42:49,065
from what I've heard,
but yes, he's alive.

540
00:42:49,997 --> 00:42:51,428
That's fortunate.

541
00:42:54,234 --> 00:42:56,564
I can't believe
this happened to you.

542
00:42:56,699 --> 00:42:58,128
Are you in pain?

543
00:42:58,263 --> 00:43:00,131
My shoulder hurts a little.

544
00:43:00,267 --> 00:43:02,461
And to be honest,
my whole body does.

545
00:43:02,596 --> 00:43:04,856
Would you like me to
call someone for you or

546
00:43:04,992 --> 00:43:07,925
- can I get you anything?
- No, that's fine.

547
00:43:08,060 --> 00:43:10,564
Actually, could you help me
use the bathroom?

548
00:43:10,699 --> 00:43:11,699
Of course.

549
00:43:15,865 --> 00:43:17,297
Thank you.

550
00:43:53,832 --> 00:43:55,230
Gorgeous flowers.

551
00:43:55,765 --> 00:43:57,262
Aren't they?

552
00:43:57,398 --> 00:43:59,790
They're from some
friends of mine.

553
00:43:59,926 --> 00:44:02,395
They actually left
just before you arrived.

554
00:44:03,767 --> 00:44:05,131
I'm so happy to see you.

555
00:44:06,226 --> 00:44:07,263
Hmm.

556
00:44:08,229 --> 00:44:09,698
I brought you a book

557
00:44:09,834 --> 00:44:12,523
to help you pass the time.

558
00:44:12,659 --> 00:44:13,956
Thank you so much.

559
00:44:14,725 --> 00:44:15,765
Have you read it?

560
00:44:15,892 --> 00:44:18,791
Yes.
Just recently, in fact.

561
00:44:18,926 --> 00:44:21,032
It's amazing.
I cried half the time.

562
00:44:21,167 --> 00:44:22,567
I'll bring you
some other book then.

563
00:44:22,630 --> 00:44:25,196
No, leave it with me,
I'll read it again.

564
00:44:25,332 --> 00:44:27,065
No, I'll bring you
another book.

565
00:44:28,767 --> 00:44:30,132
Well, I have to go.

566
00:44:30,267 --> 00:44:32,065
They're expecting me
back at the office.

567
00:44:32,200 --> 00:44:35,098
Uh, I'll come
visit again tomorrow.

568
00:44:36,063 --> 00:44:37,428
Thanks for coming.

569
00:46:54,062 --> 00:46:55,560
Excuse me.

570
00:46:56,934 --> 00:46:58,527
Could you do me
a favor, please?

571
00:46:59,062 --> 00:47:00,297
Sure.

572
00:47:00,432 --> 00:47:01,968
Could you help me
get to the men's room?

573
00:47:01,992 --> 00:47:04,263
I banged my foot
and it really hurts.

574
00:47:07,667 --> 00:47:09,131
Thank you so much.

575
00:47:13,326 --> 00:47:14,626
Easy, easy.

576
00:47:16,359 --> 00:47:17,362
Right here, sir.

577
00:50:13,065 --> 00:50:15,859
I did it. I did it.

578
00:50:20,930 --> 00:50:22,593
I did good.

579
00:50:38,897 --> 00:50:40,089
Vivian...

580
00:50:40,992 --> 00:50:43,126
didn't I tell you
that this young man here

581
00:50:43,262 --> 00:50:45,362
would not disappoint me?

582
00:50:47,662 --> 00:50:49,659
You sure did, Raymond.

00:52:44,765 --> 00:52:45,765
Hello.

597
00:52:49,929 --> 00:52:51,131
Yes?

598
00:52:53,733 --> 00:52:55,263
I can't hear you.

599
00:53:51,060 --> 00:53:52,938
That's a difficult
situation for anybody.

600
00:53:52,962 --> 00:53:55,231
I think Daniel just needs
a little bit more time.

601
00:53:55,366 --> 00:53:58,494
Listen, Neil,
give me no excuses.

602
00:53:59,262 --> 00:54:00,395
I know he needs time.

603
00:54:00,531 --> 00:54:03,830
I was first to say
that he needs time,

604
00:54:03,965 --> 00:54:05,527
but there are limits.

605
00:54:06,128 --> 00:54:07,395
Look at him.

606
00:54:07,531 --> 00:54:09,429
Look how he's acting
with that suspect.

607
00:54:09,564 --> 00:54:12,692
As if they just fucked
for the first time

608
00:54:12,827 --> 00:54:14,631
and he doesn't know
how to tell him

609
00:54:14,766 --> 00:54:15,996
that he loves him.

610
00:54:16,131 --> 00:54:18,131
Help him. He's your friend.

611
00:54:19,493 --> 00:54:20,865
Help him snap out of it.

612
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:22,194
- All right?
- Mm.

613
00:54:22,330 --> 00:54:23,406
Have a good day, sir.

614
00:54:23,430 --> 00:54:24,758
Thank you, sir.
You too.

615
00:54:32,431 --> 00:54:34,825
That suspect was
looking at me funny.

616
00:54:34,960 --> 00:54:36,534
Well, everyone looks at us
funny, Daniel.

617
00:54:36,558 --> 00:54:38,129
We're the police.

618
00:54:38,265 --> 00:54:40,428
No, he was looking at me
real funny.

619
00:54:42,728 --> 00:54:44,494
Didn't he look
a little like Liz?

620
00:54:45,701 --> 00:54:47,428
Around this area, around

621
00:54:47,564 --> 00:54:50,266
this part of his face,
around the chin?

622
00:54:50,401 --> 00:54:54,298
That little punk
looked nothing like Liz. No.

623
00:54:54,433 --> 00:54:57,428
You're thrown by the fact
that Liz is slimmer.

624
00:54:58,431 --> 00:55:01,131
She should have lost
even more weight by now.

625
00:55:02,099 --> 00:55:03,692
Trust me, he looked like her.

626
00:55:06,026 --> 00:55:08,561
If they are still alive,
what are they eating?

627
00:55:09,464 --> 00:55:12,197
Fish, I guess.
Something like that.

628
00:55:12,866 --> 00:55:14,692
Daniel, hear me out.

629
00:55:16,059 --> 00:55:17,628
The weather's already
getting better.

630
00:55:17,764 --> 00:55:19,724
They haven't called off
the search, you know that.

631
00:55:19,767 --> 00:55:20,791
And I genuinely believe,

632
00:55:20,927 --> 00:55:22,759
no matter how much
you think otherwise,

633
00:55:22,894 --> 00:55:24,566
that they're doing
a great job out there.

634
00:55:24,701 --> 00:55:25,792
I heard this morning,

635
00:55:25,927 --> 00:55:28,395
the head of the rescue mission
is hopeful.

636
00:55:28,530 --> 00:55:29,998
It's just a matter of time,
he said,

637
00:55:30,133 --> 00:55:31,423
now that
the boat's been found.

638
00:55:31,559 --> 00:55:33,457
He said that today?

639
00:55:33,592 --> 00:55:35,065
Around two hours ago.

640
00:55:41,134 --> 00:55:42,757
Will you come by
the house tonight?

641
00:55:42,893 --> 00:55:44,758
We'll come by
the house tonight.

642
00:55:44,894 --> 00:55:47,825
We brought chocolate cake
for dessert.

643
00:55:47,961 --> 00:55:49,959
Chocolate will be banned again
in this house,

644
00:55:50,095 --> 00:55:51,609
you know, once Liz gets back,
so we thought...

645
00:55:51,633 --> 00:55:53,698
Would you like me
to cook your meat a little more?

646
00:55:53,833 --> 00:55:54,833
That's okay.

647
00:55:54,926 --> 00:55:56,209
It's a little bloody
for my liking

648
00:55:56,233 --> 00:55:57,626
but it's delicious
all the same.

649
00:55:58,867 --> 00:56:02,124
I like mine almost raw...

650
00:56:02,259 --> 00:56:05,328
- but I can cook yours...
- No, no. Sit yourself down.

651
00:56:05,463 --> 00:56:06,895
Sit yourself down.
It's superb.

652
00:56:07,030 --> 00:56:09,658
I had no idea
what a good cook you are, Daniel.

653
00:56:09,794 --> 00:56:11,593
- Better even than Liz.
- Hmm.

654
00:56:12,866 --> 00:56:14,329
But soon she'll be back

655
00:56:14,464 --> 00:56:17,296
making us that wonderful
roast lamb of hers.

656
00:56:18,533 --> 00:56:20,139
Well, you're a wonderful cook,
too, Martha.

657
00:56:20,163 --> 00:56:21,959
Not like Liz.

658
00:56:22,094 --> 00:56:24,164
I'll never forget the night
the two of you came over

659
00:56:24,300 --> 00:56:26,623
and everything went
completely wrong.

660
00:56:26,758 --> 00:56:28,858
Remember that baked salmon?

661
00:56:28,993 --> 00:56:30,762
<i>It came out of the oven
almost charred.</i>

662
00:56:30,897 --> 00:56:31,897
Completely dry.

663
00:56:31,992 --> 00:56:33,995
You're wrong about that.
It was wonderful.

664
00:56:34,131 --> 00:56:35,892
<i>It was awful.</i>

665
00:56:36,027 --> 00:56:37,477
<i>And I made chocolate mousse
for dessert.</i>

666
00:56:37,501 --> 00:56:39,733
<i>Completely forgot that
Liz doesn't eat chocolate.</i>

667
00:56:39,868 --> 00:56:40,995
<i>She was so polite about it.</i>

668
00:56:41,131 --> 00:56:42,363
She said something funny.

669
00:56:42,499 --> 00:56:44,008
I can't quite remember
what it was she said.

670
00:56:44,032 --> 00:56:45,489
Do you remember what it was?

671
00:56:54,195 --> 00:56:56,164
Thank you so much.

672
00:56:58,425 --> 00:56:59,425
What for?

673
00:56:59,491 --> 00:57:00,725
For everything.

674
00:57:03,163 --> 00:57:04,731
Both of you. Thank you.

675
00:57:04,867 --> 00:57:06,296
There's no need for that.

676
00:57:07,431 --> 00:57:10,428
Do you mind
if we watched a video?

677
00:57:12,031 --> 00:57:13,362
One of the old ones.

678
00:57:18,667 --> 00:57:20,165
I... I, um...

679
00:57:20,300 --> 00:57:23,397
I don't think
that's a good idea, Daniel.

680
00:57:23,532 --> 00:57:25,729
I think we'll all find that
a little awkward.

681
00:57:25,865 --> 00:57:27,197
Hmm.

682
00:57:27,997 --> 00:57:29,890
Just a little.

683
00:57:30,025 --> 00:57:31,725
- Well...
- A minute, no more.

684
00:57:32,668 --> 00:57:34,065
To remember her by.

685
00:57:35,034 --> 00:57:36,173
I really don't think
we should.

686
00:57:36,197 --> 00:57:37,297
It won't do you any good,

687
00:57:37,432 --> 00:57:40,098
and it'll be pretty strange
for us, too.

688
00:57:42,134 --> 00:57:44,464
And you already
showed us those...

689
00:57:44,599 --> 00:57:48,658
wonderful photos of Liz
on the boat on her travels.

690
00:57:48,794 --> 00:57:50,228
I'd never seen those
photos of her

691
00:57:50,363 --> 00:57:52,164
with those reefs
she discovered.

692
00:57:53,534 --> 00:57:54,593
Real impressive.

693
00:57:57,962 --> 00:57:59,164
Okay.

694
00:58:03,466 --> 00:58:05,499
Are you sure you don't want
something else to drink?

695
00:58:05,634 --> 00:58:07,164
Oh, no, I'm fine.

696
00:58:08,360 --> 00:58:09,461
I'm fine, too.

697
00:58:33,632 --> 00:58:36,096
Those photos at the reefs
were great, weren't they?

698
00:58:36,231 --> 00:58:38,230
Really great.

699
00:58:47,197 --> 00:58:49,157
- Okay.
- Hmm.

700
00:58:49,292 --> 00:58:51,057
Okay.

701
00:58:51,193 --> 00:58:54,765
Well, we can watch
a little of that video.

702
00:58:54,900 --> 00:58:57,692
Thank you.

703
00:59:13,201 --> 00:59:15,329
Could you turn
the volume down a little?

704
00:59:16,863 --> 00:59:18,065
Sure.

705
00:59:55,226 --> 00:59:56,226
Hello?

706
00:59:59,764 --> 01:00:00,764
Yes?

707
01:00:03,193 --> 01:00:04,197
Yes?

708
01:00:29,458 --> 01:00:30,458
Who's there?

709
01:00:32,927 --> 01:00:35,390
<i>- Is this Mr. Daniels?</i>
- Yes.

710
01:00:35,525 --> 01:00:36,527
<i>Did I wake you?</i>

711
01:00:36,662 --> 01:00:38,464
No, no,
you didn't wake me.

712
01:00:38,599 --> 01:00:40,279
<i>I have some good news
for you, sir.</i>

713
01:00:40,400 --> 01:00:43,028
<i>At midnight last night,
we located your wife.</i>

714
01:00:43,164 --> 01:00:44,790
Really?

715
01:01:35,100 --> 01:01:37,593
Oh, God.
Come here.

716
01:01:43,230 --> 01:01:45,065
We were worried about you.

717
01:01:45,767 --> 01:01:47,657
I missed you so much.

718
01:01:47,792 --> 01:01:49,626
I missed you both
so much.

719
01:01:50,659 --> 01:01:52,164
I can't believe I'm back.

720
01:01:52,832 --> 01:01:54,723
That I'm okay.

721
01:01:54,859 --> 01:01:56,727
I heard that
Carol is still missing.

722
01:01:57,964 --> 01:02:01,161
Jonathan is in the next room,
but he's in pretty bad shape.

723
01:02:01,297 --> 01:02:03,798
- Daniel.
- Yes, my love?

724
01:02:03,933 --> 01:02:05,391
I want you to take me home.

725
01:02:05,526 --> 01:02:06,560
Yes, I will.

726
01:02:07,600 --> 01:02:08,999
Be patient.

727
01:02:09,135 --> 01:02:11,692
You've lost weight,
you're still weak.

728
01:02:13,962 --> 01:02:16,263
What did you all eat out there
for so long?

729
01:02:17,391 --> 01:02:18,395
Fruit.

730
01:02:20,259 --> 01:02:21,456
Animals.

731
01:02:21,592 --> 01:02:23,263
Fish.

732
01:02:29,899 --> 01:02:31,897
How's Jonathan?

733
01:02:32,032 --> 01:02:34,061
Not great, Daniel.

734
01:02:34,197 --> 01:02:36,691
He's lost a lot of blood.

735
01:02:36,827 --> 01:02:38,330
And they told me
his leg's infected

736
01:02:38,465 --> 01:02:40,626
and they said
there's a chance he'll lose it.

737
01:02:43,999 --> 01:02:45,263
He'll pull through.

738
01:02:46,200 --> 01:02:48,595
I know it.
He's one tough cookie.

739
01:02:48,731 --> 01:02:51,194
They're operating
on him tomorrow morning.

740
01:02:51,330 --> 01:02:52,490
We'll know more
by 12:00 noon,

741
01:02:52,596 --> 01:02:55,156
but no one's optimistic
about his chances.

742
01:02:55,992 --> 01:02:58,493
I heard Liz
is doing well, though.

743
01:02:58,629 --> 01:03:01,296
You can't imagine
how happy I am for her.

744
01:03:04,761 --> 01:03:06,130
I knew
this would happen someday.

745
01:03:06,266 --> 01:03:09,157
I don't know why,
but I just knew.

746
01:03:09,292 --> 01:03:11,191
When we all
get out of this hospital, Daniel,

747
01:03:11,326 --> 01:03:13,891
I am not letting him
go out to sea again.

748
01:03:14,026 --> 01:03:16,061
No way. No more research,
no more reefs,

749
01:03:16,197 --> 01:03:17,463
no more diving.
That's it.

750
01:03:17,599 --> 01:03:20,428
That's right.
You put a stop to it, Sharon.

751
01:03:22,167 --> 01:03:24,098
Have you told
the children yet?

752
01:03:25,298 --> 01:03:27,164
I don't know
what to tell them.

753
01:03:30,333 --> 01:03:32,527
Anything you need,
just give me a call.

754
01:03:33,392 --> 01:03:34,527
Thanks so much.

755
01:03:52,965 --> 01:03:54,296
What was that about?

756
01:03:55,767 --> 01:03:56,767
What's gotten into him?

757
01:03:56,860 --> 01:03:58,527
He's never acted
like that before.

758
01:04:00,866 --> 01:04:02,625
Are you hungry?

759
01:04:02,761 --> 01:04:04,527
I can fix you
something to eat.

760
01:04:06,564 --> 01:04:09,758
There's eggs.
I could make you an omelet.

761
01:04:12,401 --> 01:04:15,032
There's also some leftover
meat from the other night.

762
01:04:16,068 --> 01:04:18,230
I've missed eating
something sweet.

763
01:04:20,700 --> 01:04:21,700
What is that?

764
01:04:28,794 --> 01:04:30,999
Oh, chocolate.
That's what I want.

765
01:04:40,292 --> 01:04:41,461
Mmm.

766
01:04:45,999 --> 01:04:47,865
You sure you're all right?

767
01:04:48,001 --> 01:04:49,999
I'm totally sure.
Thank you.

768
01:04:55,465 --> 01:04:56,926
And when
the weather turned,

769
01:04:57,061 --> 01:04:59,297
they were only one day away
from heading home.

770
01:04:59,433 --> 01:05:01,833
Liz kept insisting
they drop anchor somewhere

771
01:05:01,968 --> 01:05:04,097
and wait
for the storm to pass,

772
01:05:04,233 --> 01:05:07,265
and the others insisted
that they set out.

773
01:05:07,401 --> 01:05:10,829
Happy to hear that
Liz is back safe and sound, Daniel.

774
01:05:10,964 --> 01:05:12,323
Thank you, Chief.

775
01:05:12,458 --> 01:05:14,362
All right.

776
01:05:14,497 --> 01:05:17,757
She told me
from a certain point on

777
01:05:17,892 --> 01:05:20,000
everything happened
real fast,

778
01:05:20,135 --> 01:05:22,892
and all she remembers is
trying to swim to shore.

779
01:05:23,028 --> 01:05:25,557
She also said
how strange it was that even

780
01:05:25,692 --> 01:05:27,397
when her life was in danger,

781
01:05:27,966 --> 01:05:29,856
all she could think about

782
01:05:29,992 --> 01:05:31,432
was the instruments,
the equipment,

783
01:05:31,567 --> 01:05:35,064
her files and notes
on the boat that had been lost.

784
01:05:35,200 --> 01:05:36,758
Ever the professional.

785
01:05:37,667 --> 01:05:39,428
And so very brave.

786
01:05:40,161 --> 01:05:41,263
Apart from Liz,

787
01:05:41,398 --> 01:05:43,163
one of her colleagues
survived, too,

788
01:05:43,299 --> 01:05:45,362
but he's in
critical condition.

789
01:05:46,625 --> 01:05:47,627
He lost a lot of blood

790
01:05:47,628 --> 01:05:49,692
and I heard
they amputated his leg.

791
01:05:51,068 --> 01:05:52,895
The other three
were all found dead.

792
01:05:53,031 --> 01:05:54,263
That's awful. Look,

793
01:05:54,399 --> 01:05:55,807
let's not dwell
on unpleasant things.

794
01:05:55,831 --> 01:05:59,329
What's important is that Liz
is well and here with us.

795
01:05:59,797 --> 01:06:00,999
Yes.

796
01:06:03,793 --> 01:06:05,692
Really is amazing
she made it.

797
01:06:10,432 --> 01:06:12,362
Are you sure
this outfit is okay?

798
01:06:14,098 --> 01:06:15,756
Of course it is.

799
01:06:15,892 --> 01:06:17,663
Besides,
it's your favorite.

800
01:06:17,798 --> 01:06:20,197
Yes. Yes, it is.

801
01:06:37,093 --> 01:06:38,665
I don't think
these heels go with it.

802
01:06:38,801 --> 01:06:40,560
I'll try a different pair.

803
01:06:42,493 --> 01:06:43,565
Your shoes don't fit?

804
01:06:43,701 --> 01:06:45,023
Oh, they fit.

805
01:06:45,459 --> 01:06:46,495
They're fine.

806
01:06:47,465 --> 01:06:48,901
I guess my feet
are a little swollen.

807
01:07:00,634 --> 01:07:01,634
They're fine.

808
01:07:02,029 --> 01:07:03,230
It's fine.

809
01:07:04,897 --> 01:07:05,897
They're on.

810
01:07:07,066 --> 01:07:08,659
I think I heard the doorbell.

811
01:07:16,066 --> 01:07:17,395
Can I have a cigarette?

812
01:07:18,534 --> 01:07:19,560
Sure.

813
01:07:21,967 --> 01:07:23,330
I didn't know
you smoked, Liz.

814
01:07:23,766 --> 01:07:24,895
I don't.

815
01:07:25,030 --> 01:07:26,165
I've never smoked.

816
01:07:26,301 --> 01:07:28,527
Can you believe that?
I've never even tried.

817
01:07:33,134 --> 01:07:35,032
I just really felt
like a cigarette.

818
01:07:50,597 --> 01:07:53,065
Should we all go upstairs
to the bedroom?

819
01:07:56,764 --> 01:08:00,098
I think it's best we don't go up
to the bedroom tonight.

820
01:08:01,764 --> 01:08:04,662
So, what,
we're going to fuck on the table?

821
01:08:04,798 --> 01:08:06,638
Come on, Daniel,
that would be weird.

822
01:08:06,732 --> 01:08:09,562
Uh, we'd better be
getting home soon.

823
01:08:09,697 --> 01:08:13,198
Liz, you must be tired
and I have to be up early.

824
01:08:13,333 --> 01:08:16,331
But everything
was wonderful tonight, though.

825
01:08:16,466 --> 01:08:18,172
I think you're right.
I think we should leave it

826
01:08:18,196 --> 01:08:19,564
for some other time.

827
01:08:19,699 --> 01:08:20,699
Maybe next time.

828
01:08:23,692 --> 01:08:25,264
I'll clean up the plates.

829
01:08:26,367 --> 01:08:27,937
I just can't stand having
food in front of me

830
01:08:27,961 --> 01:08:29,762
when I've finished eating.

831
01:08:29,897 --> 01:08:30,957
I will help.

832
01:08:31,092 --> 01:08:32,962
No, Martha, you sit,
I'll be right back.

833
01:08:33,097 --> 01:08:34,494
No, I want to, please.

834
01:08:35,567 --> 01:08:36,567
Thank you.

835
01:08:40,597 --> 01:08:42,824
Oh, I've had far
too much to eat tonight,

836
01:08:42,960 --> 01:08:44,556
and when I've had
far too much to eat,

837
01:08:44,692 --> 01:08:47,230
I don't sleep well at all.

838
01:08:54,266 --> 01:08:56,164
Neil, I'm going to
tell you a secret.

839
01:08:56,899 --> 01:08:57,965
You are my best friend,

840
01:08:58,101 --> 01:08:59,691
and I want to tell you
a secret.

841
01:08:59,827 --> 01:09:03,031
You are.
Aren't you my best friend?

842
01:09:03,166 --> 01:09:05,164
Of course, Daniel.

843
01:09:06,498 --> 01:09:09,659
That woman isn't Liz.
She's not my wife.

844
01:09:11,767 --> 01:09:13,125
What do you mean?

845
01:09:13,260 --> 01:09:15,008
I mean,
she's not really Liz.

846
01:09:15,032 --> 01:09:16,152
I don't know
what's going on,

847
01:09:16,265 --> 01:09:18,230
I don't know
what's happened to Liz,

848
01:09:18,366 --> 01:09:20,896
but what I do know
is that she's lying.

849
01:09:21,032 --> 01:09:22,265
She's not really my wife.

850
01:09:22,401 --> 01:09:25,193
Daniel, you've had
a lot to drink tonight.

851
01:09:25,329 --> 01:09:27,527
Just listen to me. Listen.

852
01:09:28,262 --> 01:09:29,363
We were out for a drive

853
01:09:29,498 --> 01:09:31,625
and I told her
to put on my favorite song.

854
01:09:31,760 --> 01:09:33,031
Anyone who's
close to me knows

855
01:09:33,166 --> 01:09:35,230
which song
is my favorite song.

856
01:09:35,865 --> 01:09:37,223
<i>Holiday.</i>

857
01:09:37,358 --> 01:09:38,429
Right.

858
01:09:38,564 --> 01:09:42,065
But when I asked her
to play that song...

859
01:09:43,065 --> 01:09:44,432
that's not what she played.

860
01:09:45,794 --> 01:09:47,564
<i>♪ When there's lightning ♪</i>

861
01:09:47,699 --> 01:09:50,690
<i>♪ You know it always
brings me down ♪</i>

862
01:09:50,826 --> 01:09:52,659
You like that one a lot,
too, though.

863
01:09:53,765 --> 01:09:54,790
Yes, a lot.

864
01:09:54,926 --> 01:09:56,461
But that's not
my favorite song.

865
01:09:57,326 --> 01:09:58,362
Daniel...

866
01:09:58,498 --> 01:10:01,395
you know Liz has been through
a lot lately.

867
01:10:03,098 --> 01:10:05,598
She found the chocolate cake

868
01:10:05,733 --> 01:10:08,799
that you brought over
in the refrigerator and ate it.

869
01:10:08,934 --> 01:10:09,934
All of it.

870
01:10:10,029 --> 01:10:11,165
Daniel...

871
01:10:11,301 --> 01:10:14,199
you mustn't forget Liz
was starving for days.

872
01:10:14,334 --> 01:10:15,875
It doesn't surprise me
she had a little chocolate

873
01:10:15,899 --> 01:10:17,560
now that she's back.

874
01:10:20,234 --> 01:10:22,961
I think it's time.

875
01:10:23,097 --> 01:10:24,363
We should be going.

876
01:10:24,498 --> 01:10:27,756
Um, it's pretty late
and I'm really tired.

877
01:10:27,892 --> 01:10:29,461
- Thanks for everything.
- Hmm.

878
01:10:30,430 --> 01:10:32,729
Yeah.
Thank you both so much.

879
01:10:43,129 --> 01:10:44,362
Liz!

880
01:10:45,860 --> 01:10:47,725
I have to leave for work.
I'm late.

881
01:10:49,633 --> 01:10:51,698
Can you believe
that the whole time I was lost

882
01:10:51,834 --> 01:10:53,329
in the middle of nowhere,

883
01:10:54,029 --> 01:10:55,428
cold and hungry,

884
01:10:57,001 --> 01:10:58,865
all I could think
about wasn't

885
01:10:59,001 --> 01:11:00,692
the hot meals
I was missing,

886
01:11:00,828 --> 01:11:03,230
<i>or the warm blankets
back home.</i>

887
01:11:04,393 --> 01:11:05,930
<i>Or even my dad.</i>

888
01:11:06,066 --> 01:11:07,599
<i>All I could think about...</i>

889
01:11:07,734 --> 01:11:08,891
- was your cock.
- Liz.

890
01:11:09,026 --> 01:11:11,999
We could fuck
with you wearing your uniform.

891
01:11:12,668 --> 01:11:13,725
Or I could wear it.

892
01:11:15,425 --> 01:11:16,593
No, you wear it.

893
01:11:17,834 --> 01:11:19,197
Ow!

894
01:11:23,196 --> 01:11:24,758
Have you lost your mind?

895
01:11:25,534 --> 01:11:27,027
That hurt.

896
01:11:27,163 --> 01:11:28,643
I'm sorry, darling.
I thought you liked a little club play

897
01:11:28,667 --> 01:11:29,692
when we fuck.

898
01:11:31,159 --> 01:11:32,640
<i>Tonight,
we honor Liz</i>

899
01:11:32,664 --> 01:11:35,797
<i>who has advanced
our maritime research</i>

900
01:11:35,932 --> 01:11:37,390
<i>with her passion,</i>

901
01:11:37,526 --> 01:11:38,762
<i>her persistence,</i>

902
01:11:38,898 --> 01:11:40,527
<i>her expertise.</i>

903
01:11:46,733 --> 01:11:49,563
<i>And now I have
a little surprise for you all.</i>

904
01:11:49,699 --> 01:11:52,265
You could at least
try and look happy for Liz.

905
01:11:52,400 --> 01:11:55,124
It's outrageous,
the way you've been behaving.

906
01:11:55,260 --> 01:11:57,657
You haven't said
a single word to her all evening.

907
01:11:57,793 --> 01:11:59,105
You've been treating her
very badly.

908
01:11:59,129 --> 01:12:00,792
<i>Safe and sound.</i>

909
01:12:00,927 --> 01:12:03,099
<i>The helicopter pilot
that located</i>

910
01:12:03,234 --> 01:12:04,959
<i>and recovered
Liz and Jonathan.</i>

911
01:12:05,094 --> 01:12:09,257
George, I'm tired.
Could you stop talking?

912
01:12:09,392 --> 01:12:10,527
Snap out of it.

913
01:12:16,599 --> 01:12:17,729
George,

914
01:12:17,865 --> 01:12:19,266
open your eyes

915
01:12:19,402 --> 01:12:22,432
and look clearly
at what's going on around you.

916
01:12:22,567 --> 01:12:24,362
<i>Thank you
all so very much.</i>

917
01:12:25,065 --> 01:12:26,428
We might all be in danger.

918
01:12:26,564 --> 01:12:28,040
<i>The most important
thing to me...</i>

919
01:12:28,064 --> 01:12:29,065
What, are you drunk?

920
01:12:29,200 --> 01:12:30,630
<i>...are the people
that I love.</i>

921
01:12:34,800 --> 01:12:37,461
Jonathan, you should know that
you're in our prayers.

922
01:12:38,097 --> 01:12:40,063
In all of our prayers.

923
01:12:40,198 --> 01:12:42,891
You'll feel better soon.
I know it.

924
01:12:43,026 --> 01:12:45,164
You'll be home with your kids
in no time.

925
01:12:47,030 --> 01:12:48,997
Are you a doctor?

926
01:12:49,133 --> 01:12:51,862
No, Jonathan,
it's me. Liz.

927
01:12:51,997 --> 01:12:53,692
It's Liz, my love.

928
01:12:56,131 --> 01:12:57,758
Can I have some Kool-Aid?

929
01:12:58,533 --> 01:12:59,533
Water...

930
01:13:00,029 --> 01:13:01,527
no Kool-Aid.

931
01:13:07,864 --> 01:13:09,163
Sharon,

932
01:13:09,299 --> 01:13:11,395
why don't we
step outside and...

933
01:13:11,530 --> 01:13:13,361
leave these two alone
for a minute.

934
01:13:13,496 --> 01:13:15,164
I'm sure they have a lot
to talk about.

935
01:13:20,163 --> 01:13:21,692
Can I ask you something?

936
01:13:25,567 --> 01:13:27,528
Are you sure...

937
01:13:27,663 --> 01:13:29,831
that man dying in there
is really your husband?

938
01:13:29,966 --> 01:13:33,263
Are you sure
that's Jonathan?

939
01:13:41,062 --> 01:13:43,126
If I were you...

940
01:13:43,261 --> 01:13:47,532
I'd try putting a pair
of your real husband's shoes on him

941
01:13:47,668 --> 01:13:49,495
and see if they fit.

942
01:13:49,631 --> 01:13:53,164
And I'd tell your kids
to quit crying because

943
01:13:53,300 --> 01:13:54,890
that man in there
isn't their father.

944
01:13:55,026 --> 01:13:56,593
It's just some guy
that looks like him.

945
01:13:57,259 --> 01:13:58,566
A lot.

946
01:13:58,701 --> 01:14:00,233
But it's not him. And,

947
01:14:00,369 --> 01:14:04,725
whoever did this, Sharon,
has done a really good job.

948
01:14:05,898 --> 01:14:07,364
Almost perfect...

949
01:14:07,500 --> 01:14:11,731
but not perfect enough.
Their feet are different.

950
01:14:11,866 --> 01:14:14,164
Their feet are bigger

951
01:14:15,065 --> 01:14:17,659
and softer for some reason.

952
01:14:19,600 --> 01:14:21,999
And there's other things, too.
Lots of things.

953
01:14:23,392 --> 01:14:24,395
Sharon...

954
01:14:25,326 --> 01:14:27,090
she asked me

955
01:14:27,225 --> 01:14:30,758
to fuck her in my uniform,
then hit me...

956
01:14:31,964 --> 01:14:34,626
hard with my club.

957
01:14:35,592 --> 01:14:36,660
Can you believe that?

958
01:14:37,062 --> 01:14:38,461
She left a mark.

959
01:14:41,893 --> 01:14:44,560
We didn't, obviously.
Fuck, I mean.

960
01:14:47,300 --> 01:14:51,224
<i>You know he's in there
right now. With her.</i>

961
01:14:51,359 --> 01:14:54,367
<i>And they're laughing at us,
Sharon. That's a fact.</i>

962
01:14:54,502 --> 01:14:57,756
<i>They're laughing at us.
They're playing us for fools.</i>

963
01:14:57,892 --> 01:14:59,562
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

964
01:15:00,031 --> 01:15:01,394
I'd like to transfer

965
01:15:01,530 --> 01:15:04,199
the... the money I have
in a joint account

966
01:15:04,335 --> 01:15:06,964
I share with my wife
to a personal account, please.

967
01:15:07,099 --> 01:15:09,296
Okay. Can I see
some form of ID?

968
01:15:12,667 --> 01:15:13,762
Here you are.

969
01:15:13,897 --> 01:15:14,897
Thank you.

970
01:15:14,992 --> 01:15:16,733
I see you're
a police officer, huh?

971
01:15:16,868 --> 01:15:18,659
- Yes, ma'am, I am.
- Okay.

972
01:15:26,601 --> 01:15:28,801
And did you want to transfer
the entire balance?

973
01:15:28,932 --> 01:15:30,725
The entire balance. Yes.

974
01:15:38,233 --> 01:15:39,725
Aren't you going
to eat something?

975
01:15:40,930 --> 01:15:42,395
I'm not hungry.

976
01:15:43,932 --> 01:15:45,362
Please, darling, eat.

977
01:15:46,491 --> 01:15:47,758
I'm not hungry.

978
01:15:49,959 --> 01:15:51,593
Would you like
something else to eat?

979
01:15:53,798 --> 01:15:56,593
I'm not hungry.

980
01:16:11,765 --> 01:16:13,661
Hello? Yes?

981
01:16:16,533 --> 01:16:17,533
Liz?

982
01:16:19,459 --> 01:16:20,724
Liz, is that you?

983
01:16:28,033 --> 01:16:30,560
Speak to me,
please, Liz.

984
01:16:48,266 --> 01:16:51,229
You took my phone,
give it back.

985
01:16:51,365 --> 01:16:52,732
Darling, don't start
that again.

986
01:16:52,867 --> 01:16:54,263
Why would I
take your phone?

987
01:17:02,900 --> 01:17:05,593
<i>Monty probably knocked it behind
the couch or something.</i>

988
01:17:06,526 --> 01:17:07,990
It'll be here somewhere.

989
01:17:09,093 --> 01:17:11,496
We can look for it
when we're finished eating.

990
01:17:11,632 --> 01:17:12,632
Liz!

991
01:17:14,599 --> 01:17:15,626
Liz!

992
01:17:16,467 --> 01:17:18,329
Give it.

993
01:17:18,465 --> 01:17:22,197
Listen, I have some news
that'll cheer you up.

994
01:17:23,496 --> 01:17:25,428
It'll bring
your appetite back too.

995
01:17:30,097 --> 01:17:31,626
Daniel, I'm pregnant.

996
01:17:34,900 --> 01:17:36,732
I know it sounds impossible

997
01:17:36,868 --> 01:17:38,560
but the doctor said it's true.

998
01:17:39,196 --> 01:17:40,229
She can't explain it.

999
01:17:40,365 --> 01:17:43,532
She said it might be
psychological,

1000
01:17:43,668 --> 01:17:45,263
me never being pregnant.

1001
01:17:47,566 --> 01:17:50,626
Are you excited to find out
if it's a boy or girl?

1002
01:17:52,765 --> 01:17:54,060
I know I am.

1003
01:17:54,196 --> 01:17:55,692
Isn't it wonderful?

1004
01:17:57,626 --> 01:17:59,390
I want you out of the house.

1005
01:17:59,525 --> 01:18:00,624
What did you say?

1006
01:18:00,759 --> 01:18:04,428
I want you out
of my house.

1007
01:18:05,900 --> 01:18:07,659
- Why?
- You know why.

1008
01:18:08,993 --> 01:18:11,164
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

1009
01:18:15,965 --> 01:18:18,032
I know what's going on.

1010
01:18:19,263 --> 01:18:21,296
I know you're lying to me.

1011
01:18:22,797 --> 01:18:24,366
Leave...

1012
01:18:24,502 --> 01:18:27,328
and I promise no one will
ever come looking for you.

1013
01:18:27,464 --> 01:18:29,725
But if you don't,
I will have you arrested

1014
01:18:29,861 --> 01:18:31,725
and you'll go to jail.
Don't touch me.

1015
01:18:33,534 --> 01:18:35,197
Pack your things

1016
01:18:35,333 --> 01:18:38,296
and get out.
Without any fuss. Tonight.

1017
01:18:41,899 --> 01:18:43,395
I'm not leaving, Daniel.

1018
01:18:45,128 --> 01:18:46,362
This is my home.

1019
01:18:56,234 --> 01:18:57,927
Passenger,
show me your hands.

1020
01:18:59,732 --> 01:19:00,732
Fuck it.

1021
01:19:03,400 --> 01:19:05,329
Turn off the vehicle,
please, miss.

1022
01:19:06,029 --> 01:19:07,230
Shut up.

1023
01:19:07,996 --> 01:19:09,199
Sorry, Officer.

1024
01:19:09,334 --> 01:19:11,068
You ran a red light
and you were speeding, miss.

1025
01:19:11,092 --> 01:19:12,239
I'll need you to step out
of your vehicle.

1026
01:19:12,263 --> 01:19:14,227
Yeah, you're right. Shut up.

1027
01:19:14,362 --> 01:19:16,429
I didn't see the red light.

1028
01:19:16,564 --> 01:19:18,560
It's all right.
Step out, please, miss.

1029
01:19:24,825 --> 01:19:26,362
Place your hands
on the vehicle.

1030
01:19:30,667 --> 01:19:31,725
Spread your legs.

1031
01:19:38,233 --> 01:19:39,830
What's that in
your pocket, miss?

1032
01:19:39,965 --> 01:19:41,396
It's my cell.

1033
01:19:41,531 --> 01:19:42,942
I want you
to take it out slowly

1034
01:19:42,966 --> 01:19:44,230
and place it on the vehicle.

1035
01:19:52,368 --> 01:19:54,361
Where did you get this phone?
Who gave it to you?

1036
01:19:54,497 --> 01:19:56,094
It's my phone.
I bought it.

1037
01:19:56,230 --> 01:19:57,230
Don't lie to me.

1038
01:19:57,297 --> 01:19:58,757
- What?
- Don't lie to me.

1039
01:19:58,892 --> 01:20:00,035
Do you know
a woman named Liz?

1040
01:20:00,059 --> 01:20:01,342
What? No.
No, that's my phone.

1041
01:20:01,366 --> 01:20:02,931
This phone, miss.
Who gave it to you?

1042
01:20:03,066 --> 01:20:04,528
- This is my phone.
- What?

1043
01:20:04,664 --> 01:20:06,442
- This is my phone.
- Are you out of your mind?

1044
01:20:06,466 --> 01:20:07,708
- That's my phone.
- Put the phone down, man.

1045
01:20:07,732 --> 01:20:08,891
Quiet down, sir.

1046
01:20:09,026 --> 01:20:10,210
You've got no right
looking at her phone.

1047
01:20:10,234 --> 01:20:11,608
Passenger,
remain in the vehicle.

1048
01:20:11,632 --> 01:20:13,707
You'll stop right there
if you know what's good for you.

1049
01:20:13,731 --> 01:20:15,540
- Daniel, take it easy.
- I said, put the fucking...

1050
01:20:15,564 --> 01:20:18,065
Daniel, what the fuck?

1051
01:20:18,932 --> 01:20:20,200
What the fuck!

1052
01:20:20,335 --> 01:20:21,774
Bravo Two to headquarters,
shots fired. Subject down.

1053
01:20:21,798 --> 01:20:23,958
I'm sorry, it was an accident.
Here, give me your hand.

1054
01:20:29,758 --> 01:20:30,963
Daniel, are you shitting me?

1055
01:20:31,098 --> 01:20:32,626
What the fuck are you doing?

1056
01:20:33,293 --> 01:20:34,293
I'm sorry.

1057
01:20:36,793 --> 01:20:38,560
I'm sorry.

1058
01:20:45,166 --> 01:20:47,197
Dr. Evans.
Dr. Evans.

1059
01:20:47,899 --> 01:20:49,196
Hi, Neil.

1060
01:20:49,332 --> 01:20:50,729
Dr. Evans,
how did it go?

1061
01:20:50,865 --> 01:20:52,865
He'll be on medication
for a few months,

1062
01:20:52,900 --> 01:20:54,195
but it's nothing serious.

1063
01:20:54,330 --> 01:20:56,560
At least
it doesn't seem serious.

1064
01:20:57,726 --> 01:20:59,529
In the simplest
possible terms,

1065
01:20:59,664 --> 01:21:03,098
I'd call it a mild form of
persecutory delusion.

1066
01:21:03,966 --> 01:21:05,962
I can't say what caused it,

1067
01:21:06,098 --> 01:21:07,798
but I think he'll be fine.

1068
01:21:07,934 --> 01:21:09,593
He was perfectly cooperative.

1069
01:21:10,592 --> 01:21:11,593
It'll take some time,

1070
01:21:11,728 --> 01:21:13,730
but he'll get over it
in my opinion.

1071
01:21:13,866 --> 01:21:16,190
Can he carry on working?

1072
01:21:16,326 --> 01:21:19,999
It would be better
if he took some time off from the force.

1073
01:21:20,135 --> 01:21:23,899
Better for him,
and for everyone here.

1074
01:21:24,035 --> 01:21:26,461
And he's not a danger
to himself?

1075
01:21:26,964 --> 01:21:28,163
Or to others?

1076
01:21:28,299 --> 01:21:30,931
No, he's just
a little confused.

1077
01:21:31,066 --> 01:21:33,593
He poses no real danger
to anyone.

1078
01:21:33,729 --> 01:21:36,028
So long as he keeps taking
his medication,

1079
01:21:36,163 --> 01:21:37,494
I think he'll be fine.

1080
01:21:39,860 --> 01:21:42,362
He really put the fear
in me, Doctor.

1081
01:21:43,262 --> 01:21:44,626
It was like a madman.

1082
01:21:45,625 --> 01:21:46,993
I got scared.

1083
01:21:47,128 --> 01:21:47,994
I thought he was going to kill
everyone out there.

1084
01:21:47,996 --> 01:21:49,690
Me included.

1085
01:21:49,825 --> 01:21:51,758
There's nothing
to worry about.

1086
01:22:10,794 --> 01:22:12,428
Daniel,
are you going to eat?

1087
01:22:13,659 --> 01:22:15,494
Just answer me.
Yes or no?

1088
01:22:20,265 --> 01:22:22,131
Why are you
doing this to me?

1089
01:22:24,526 --> 01:22:25,999
You'll starve to death.

1090
01:22:27,097 --> 01:22:28,461
Is that what you want?

1091
01:22:34,097 --> 01:22:35,626
What else can I do?

1092
01:22:37,626 --> 01:22:39,230
I don't know
what else to do.

1093
01:22:44,064 --> 01:22:45,999
Talk to me, please.

1094
01:22:48,801 --> 01:22:50,395
You have to eat something.

1095
01:22:52,167 --> 01:22:54,190
I'll make you
whatever you'd like.

1096
01:22:55,226 --> 01:22:57,296
Just tell me what you want,
and I'll make it.

1097
01:22:58,129 --> 01:22:59,494
Whatever you want.

1098
01:23:05,997 --> 01:23:07,296
Oh...

1099
01:23:15,202 --> 01:23:18,299
Sweetheart,
I don't know what to say.

1100
01:23:18,435 --> 01:23:22,560
I feel ashamed
to call that monster your husband.

1101
01:23:23,430 --> 01:23:25,098
I always knew
that there was

1102
01:23:25,233 --> 01:23:26,932
something not quite
right with him,

1103
01:23:27,068 --> 01:23:28,758
but I always hoped
that maybe...

1104
01:23:31,333 --> 01:23:33,692
Don't you dare
speak about Daniel that way.

1105
01:23:34,999 --> 01:23:36,399
He's given me everything.

1106
01:23:36,534 --> 01:23:40,631
He loves me like no one else,
and all you do is judge him.

1107
01:23:40,766 --> 01:23:44,098
Don't you dare speak badly
about him to me ever again.

1108
01:23:45,634 --> 01:23:46,725
You hear me, Dad?

1109
01:23:49,296 --> 01:23:51,296
Apologize for what you said.

1110
01:23:51,930 --> 01:23:53,626
To me. Now.

1111
01:24:03,330 --> 01:24:05,263
Dad, last night
I had a dream.

1112
01:24:06,499 --> 01:24:09,692
I was lying on that beach
where they found me.

1113
01:24:09,827 --> 01:24:12,330
I don't remember
what I was wearing,

1114
01:24:12,466 --> 01:24:14,730
but it was like
I had been there for years.

1115
01:24:14,866 --> 01:24:16,031
And you were there.

1116
01:24:16,166 --> 01:24:18,823
Daniel was there.
We all were.

1117
01:24:18,959 --> 01:24:20,271
Funny thing is,
life in that place

1118
01:24:20,295 --> 01:24:21,999
wasn't like it is here.

1119
01:24:23,266 --> 01:24:25,065
It took me
a few days to realize,

1120
01:24:25,201 --> 01:24:27,164
but that place went by
different rules.

1121
01:24:28,296 --> 01:24:30,164
There, dogs were in charge.

1122
01:24:32,563 --> 01:24:35,428
People were animals
and animals were people.

1123
01:24:37,599 --> 01:24:40,395
I must admit, Dad, the dogs
treated us pretty well.

1124
01:24:42,196 --> 01:24:44,430
They gave us food...

1125
01:24:44,565 --> 01:24:47,131
and they bandaged our wounds
after licking them,

1126
01:24:47,767 --> 01:24:49,757
and they never bit us,

1127
01:24:49,893 --> 01:24:51,958
even when we tried
to hurt them.

1128
01:24:52,093 --> 01:24:54,197
And every morning
they gave us chocolate to eat.

1129
01:24:54,332 --> 01:24:57,128
Because dogs mustn't eat
chocolate, you know.

1130
01:24:57,264 --> 01:24:59,829
Lamb, which is
my favorite food

1131
01:24:59,964 --> 01:25:01,199
was a rare treat,

1132
01:25:01,334 --> 01:25:04,130
and the dogs mostly
kept that for themselves.

1133
01:25:04,266 --> 01:25:07,096
For the first few days,
I refused to eat

1134
01:25:07,232 --> 01:25:08,891
and I waited
for leftover lamb chop,

1135
01:25:09,027 --> 01:25:11,659
but someone else
always got to it first so...

1136
01:25:13,365 --> 01:25:14,791
eventually, I just ate
the chocolate

1137
01:25:14,926 --> 01:25:16,758
because there was
lots of it around.

1138
01:25:17,867 --> 01:25:19,957
And I didn't like it much

1139
01:25:20,093 --> 01:25:22,496
but it was better than going
hungry and so...

1140
01:25:23,399 --> 01:25:26,197
from then on,
I ate chocolate every day.

1141
01:25:27,992 --> 01:25:30,032
And here's the conclusion
I came to.

1142
01:25:31,834 --> 01:25:34,196
It's better
to eat something

1143
01:25:34,332 --> 01:25:36,666
that's always available
when you're hungry

1144
01:25:36,801 --> 01:25:37,881
than to depend on something

1145
01:25:37,992 --> 01:25:40,164
that runs out early
every morning.

1146
01:25:41,626 --> 01:25:42,799
And I mean every morning.

1147
01:25:47,559 --> 01:25:48,559
Daniel isn't perfect,

1148
01:25:48,662 --> 01:25:50,362
but he's always been
there for me.

1149
01:25:50,998 --> 01:25:52,461
Go up and see him now.

1150
01:25:53,661 --> 01:25:55,198
He'll be so happy
to see you.

1151
01:25:56,068 --> 01:25:57,348
I have things to do.
I got to go.

1152
01:25:57,399 --> 01:26:00,725
Go up. Just for a minute.
Say hello.

1153
01:26:02,530 --> 01:26:05,230
Sorry, I got to go.
Some other time.

1154
01:26:28,567 --> 01:26:29,567
Hi.

1155
01:26:30,668 --> 01:26:32,132
Oh, hi, my darling.

1156
01:26:32,768 --> 01:26:35,058
I just went to the store.

1157
01:26:35,194 --> 01:26:38,461
I got some wonderful tomatoes
and some beef tenderloin.

1158
01:26:40,098 --> 01:26:42,529
I ran into Tammy and Kate.

1159
01:26:42,664 --> 01:26:45,065
Tammy said they're really
missing you at work.

1160
01:26:50,559 --> 01:26:51,732
I'm hungry.

1161
01:26:53,430 --> 01:26:55,527
Yes, my love.
What can I make for you?

1162
01:26:56,959 --> 01:26:58,763
Want the beef fillet
I just bought,

1163
01:26:58,898 --> 01:27:00,263
or some spaghetti?

1164
01:27:00,398 --> 01:27:01,799
There's some salmon
in the freezer.

1165
01:27:01,935 --> 01:27:04,230
Is it fish or meat
you want?

1166
01:27:06,393 --> 01:27:07,564
Meat.

1167
01:27:07,699 --> 01:27:08,699
Wonderful.

1168
01:27:13,430 --> 01:27:15,494
- Sweetheart.
- Hmm?

1169
01:27:17,629 --> 01:27:20,629
I want you to chop
one of your fingers off

1170
01:27:20,764 --> 01:27:25,364
cook it with cauliflower,
and bring it to me to eat.

1171
01:27:25,499 --> 01:27:29,560
Or your thumb maybe,
whatever you think is best.

1172
01:27:29,695 --> 01:27:31,758
That's what I want.
Can you do that for me?

1173
01:29:34,859 --> 01:29:36,461
- Hi, Daniel.
- Hi, Doctor.

1174
01:29:36,996 --> 01:29:38,296
Come on in.

1175
01:29:41,531 --> 01:29:44,430
I think we're doing
much better, Daniel.

1176
01:29:44,566 --> 01:29:47,565
I think the medication is
starting to take effect.

1177
01:29:47,701 --> 01:29:49,131
How are you feeling?

1178
01:29:50,065 --> 01:29:52,290
I'm feeling better, Doctor.

1179
01:29:52,426 --> 01:29:53,593
That's great.

1180
01:29:58,031 --> 01:29:59,758
I just worry sometimes.

1181
01:30:01,998 --> 01:30:03,428
What about, Daniel?

1182
01:30:06,198 --> 01:30:08,065
I want to tell you something.

1183
01:30:08,930 --> 01:30:11,090
But first...

1184
01:30:11,226 --> 01:30:16,126
I want you to check no one
is listening in. That...

1185
01:30:16,261 --> 01:30:20,164
she's not at the door
or anywhere in the, in the house.

1186
01:30:22,034 --> 01:30:24,224
No one's at
the door, Daniel.

1187
01:30:24,359 --> 01:30:25,461
Liz is out.

1188
01:30:26,163 --> 01:30:27,527
What's troubling you?

1189
01:30:32,634 --> 01:30:33,692
That woman...

1190
01:30:35,229 --> 01:30:37,730
who says she's Liz...

1191
01:30:37,865 --> 01:30:41,999
chopped off her finger last night
and served it to me

1192
01:30:42,599 --> 01:30:43,758
to eat.

1193
01:30:44,626 --> 01:30:47,362
I didn't, of course, eat it.

1194
01:30:48,095 --> 01:30:49,565
The cat did.

1195
01:30:49,701 --> 01:30:51,658
And early this morning,

1196
01:30:51,793 --> 01:30:53,892
I woke up
and came downstairs,

1197
01:30:54,028 --> 01:30:58,329
to find her punching herself
in the face and belly.

1198
01:31:03,794 --> 01:31:05,593
How have you
been sleeping, Daniel?

1199
01:31:07,634 --> 01:31:10,428
Not well, Doctor.

1200
01:31:12,467 --> 01:31:13,726
I worry

1201
01:31:13,861 --> 01:31:17,064
that she'll hurt me, too,
at some point.

1202
01:31:17,199 --> 01:31:18,399
You got to get her
out of here,

1203
01:31:18,491 --> 01:31:19,560
I'm telling you.

1204
01:31:20,692 --> 01:31:23,163
All in good time, Daniel.

1205
01:31:23,299 --> 01:31:26,263
Just be patient, okay?
Trust me.

1206
01:31:27,764 --> 01:31:28,764
Okay.

1207
01:31:30,799 --> 01:31:32,197
All right, Doctor.

1208
01:31:34,268 --> 01:31:35,725
<i>Liz,
have you heard of</i>

1209
01:31:35,861 --> 01:31:38,131
<i>doctor-patient
confidentiality?</i>

1210
01:31:38,634 --> 01:31:39,634
<i>Yes.</i>

1211
01:31:41,894 --> 01:31:43,068
<i>So you
know that</i>

1212
01:31:43,092 --> 01:31:45,098
<i>you can tell me
anything, right?</i>

1213
01:31:46,129 --> 01:31:47,461
Yes, I know.

1214
01:31:50,867 --> 01:31:53,626
Did someone hit you, Liz?

1215
01:31:55,229 --> 01:31:56,758
What happened to you?

1216
01:32:01,728 --> 01:32:02,909
I know you've
just been through

1217
01:32:02,933 --> 01:32:05,164
something terribly tragic.

1218
01:32:07,125 --> 01:32:10,263
And I am truly sorry
about the miscarriage.

1219
01:32:12,363 --> 01:32:15,032
But you have to
speak out, Liz.

1220
01:32:18,532 --> 01:32:21,659
If someone is responsible
for all of this...

1221
01:32:23,101 --> 01:32:25,659
well, then you
really should say so.

1222
01:32:26,865 --> 01:32:28,461
For your own sake.

1223
01:32:34,392 --> 01:32:35,593
He hit me.

1224
01:32:37,963 --> 01:32:39,164
Daniel did.

1225
01:32:42,559 --> 01:32:44,230
But it wasn't his fault.

1226
01:32:46,799 --> 01:32:48,263
I talked back.

1227
01:32:49,668 --> 01:32:50,691
And he's on these pills

1228
01:32:50,827 --> 01:32:53,197
that make him aggressive
from time to time.

1229
01:32:54,900 --> 01:32:56,593
He didn't do it on purpose.

1230
01:32:59,833 --> 01:33:00,964
He really was very happy

1231
01:33:01,099 --> 01:33:02,692
when I told him
I was pregnant.

1232
01:33:05,965 --> 01:33:07,197
And you know Daniel...

1233
01:33:07,933 --> 01:33:09,461
he would never hurt anyone.

1234
01:33:13,859 --> 01:33:15,725
Please don't tell anyone
about this.

1235
01:33:18,034 --> 01:33:19,692
I've already put it
behind me.

1236
01:33:21,095 --> 01:33:22,296
You should, too.

1237
01:33:26,959 --> 01:33:29,757
I'm sorry.
I'm just so tired and

1238
01:33:29,893 --> 01:33:32,297
after everything
that's happened...

1239
01:33:32,433 --> 01:33:36,498
I just can't anymore.
So thank you so much.

1240
01:33:36,633 --> 01:33:37,827
Have a nice day.

1241
01:33:37,962 --> 01:33:39,296
Liz...

1242
01:33:40,325 --> 01:33:41,329
Hi, Dad.

1243
01:33:42,362 --> 01:33:44,031
I'm just calling to say that

1244
01:33:44,167 --> 01:33:46,395
I won't be able to
make it today.

1245
01:33:47,993 --> 01:33:50,296
I need to go into the office,
there's...

1246
01:33:50,965 --> 01:33:52,725
a meeting I can't miss.

1247
01:33:54,235 --> 01:33:57,890
Tell Uncle Stanley
I'm so sad not to see him,

1248
01:33:58,026 --> 01:34:00,395
and make sure to take
lots of pictures, okay?

1249
01:34:01,634 --> 01:34:03,699
Oh, Dad, I forgot.

1250
01:34:03,834 --> 01:34:04,935
We're thinking of going away

1251
01:34:04,959 --> 01:34:07,296
for a few days
to get some rest.

1252
01:34:08,498 --> 01:34:11,156
I'm going to take
some time off, and...

1253
01:34:12,026 --> 01:34:15,858
it'll do Daniel good too.
Calm him down.

1254
01:34:15,993 --> 01:34:18,230
So don't come around
for a few days, okay?

1255
01:34:20,794 --> 01:34:22,890
I'm not sure
where we're going yet.

1256
01:34:23,025 --> 01:34:25,362
You know Daniel,
he never can decide.

1257
01:34:25,498 --> 01:34:27,792
But it'll probably be
somewhere remote

1258
01:34:27,927 --> 01:34:30,196
with bad reception,
so I'll let you know

1259
01:34:30,331 --> 01:34:32,428
where we are
when we get there.

1260
01:34:33,458 --> 01:34:34,461
Okay, bye.

1261
01:34:49,268 --> 01:34:51,999
It's good to see you're up
and about, my love.

1262
01:35:02,197 --> 01:35:04,163
Yesterday, the doctor said

1263
01:35:04,298 --> 01:35:06,363
we need to up
your medication a little

1264
01:35:07,333 --> 01:35:10,625
and get you outdoors
from time to time.

1265
01:35:10,761 --> 01:35:12,395
We can go for a walk,
if you like.

1266
01:35:13,626 --> 01:35:15,296
No, I don't feel like it.

1267
01:35:15,997 --> 01:35:17,191
Whatever you want.

1268
01:35:17,326 --> 01:35:18,461
I'm hungry.

1269
01:35:19,701 --> 01:35:21,328
I'll make you something.

1270
01:35:21,464 --> 01:35:23,395
I'll bring it to you.
You go up.

1271
01:35:25,668 --> 01:35:28,362
I'm not just hungry.

1272
01:35:29,799 --> 01:35:31,527
I'm famished.

1273
01:35:36,101 --> 01:35:38,593
But don't go serving me
any fingers today.

1274
01:35:40,032 --> 01:35:43,695
Your fingers are revolting.

1275
01:35:43,831 --> 01:35:48,164
In fact, I didn't even eat it.
I fed it to Monty instead.

1276
01:35:49,626 --> 01:35:51,699
I need something filling.

1277
01:35:51,834 --> 01:35:54,560
Your entire leg, let's say.

1278
01:35:56,929 --> 01:35:58,131
Or...

1279
01:35:59,963 --> 01:36:01,263
your liver.

1280
01:36:03,263 --> 01:36:05,891
It's full of iron, liver.

1281
01:36:06,026 --> 01:36:09,428
Ultra-nutritious.
That's what they say.

1282
01:36:09,563 --> 01:36:11,665
And that's what
I need to eat today

1283
01:36:11,801 --> 01:36:13,626
because I'm feeling weak.

1284
01:38:20,893 --> 01:38:23,960

1285
01:38:24,095 --> 01:38:27,626

1290
01:38:44,959 --> 01:38:46,560
Step
on the scale, please.

1291
01:38:53,929 --> 01:38:55,131
Good.

1292
01:38:56,096 --> 01:38:57,395
Stand up straight.

1293
01:39:04,996 --> 01:39:06,230
Turn around.

1294
01:39:19,632 --> 01:39:20,632
Perfect.

1295
01:39:22,766 --> 01:39:24,197
Step off, please.

1296
01:39:33,732 --> 01:39:35,098
Very good.

1297
01:39:53,901 --> 01:39:55,101
You have 10 minutes this time.

1298
01:39:55,231 --> 01:39:56,460
- Fifteen.
- Ten minutes.

1299
01:39:56,596 --> 01:39:58,330
Not a moment more.
It's the best I can do.

1300
01:39:58,465 --> 01:40:00,462
- Ten minutes is fine.
- Okay, follow me.

1301
01:40:00,964 --> 01:40:02,164
Wait here.

1302
01:40:07,468 --> 01:40:09,628
Do you have some preference,
whether it's man or woman?

1303
01:40:09,665 --> 01:40:10,692
No.

1304
01:40:12,060 --> 01:40:14,429
This one got brought in today.
Gunshot wound.

1305
01:40:14,831 --> 01:40:16,032
That'll do fine.

1306
01:40:36,625 --> 01:40:37,632
Anna, you can come in.

1307
01:40:37,768 --> 01:40:39,296
Harold, wait here, please.

1308
01:40:45,859 --> 01:40:47,524
Nine minutes,
I'll be waiting outside.

1309
01:40:47,659 --> 01:40:49,197
He said 10 minutes.

1310
01:40:52,725 --> 01:40:54,456
Anna, this is it.

1311
01:40:54,592 --> 01:40:55,730
The moment of truth.

1312
01:40:55,866 --> 01:40:57,561
Isn't it wonderful?

1313
01:40:57,697 --> 01:40:59,892
As you heard yourself,
there's not much time.

1314
01:41:00,027 --> 01:41:02,527
Can you imagine
what the final test might be?

1315
01:41:03,566 --> 01:41:04,590
Great.

1316
01:41:04,726 --> 01:41:06,490
And do you think
you can do it?

1317
01:41:06,626 --> 01:41:08,626
I think I can. Yes.

1318
01:41:08,761 --> 01:41:10,890
Actually, I'm sure I can,
Ms. Emily.

1319
01:41:11,025 --> 01:41:13,131
I think so too,
my dear, sweet Anna.

1320
01:41:14,326 --> 01:41:15,329
Go ahead.

1321
01:41:37,959 --> 01:41:39,725
What if you say
the dead boy's name?

1322
01:41:40,831 --> 01:41:42,032
What's his name?

1323
01:41:46,592 --> 01:41:47,593
Martin Lowe.

1324
01:41:56,162 --> 01:41:57,626
Dear Martin Lowe,

1325
01:41:59,999 --> 01:42:02,164
take life from these hands.

1326
01:42:07,491 --> 01:42:08,560
Open your eyes.

1327
01:42:14,997 --> 01:42:16,396
I think he moved.

1328
01:42:16,898 --> 01:42:19,062
His leg, it moved.

1329
01:42:19,197 --> 01:42:20,527
I did it.

1330
01:42:22,827 --> 01:42:25,498
Can I try with
some other corpse?

1331
01:42:25,633 --> 01:42:27,164
Focus, my dear.

1332
01:42:27,833 --> 01:42:28,927
Touch him, if you like.

1333
01:42:29,062 --> 01:42:30,523
That might help.

1334
01:42:30,659 --> 01:42:31,999
I don't want to touch him.

1335
01:42:32,135 --> 01:42:33,441
What is that
supposed to mean?

1336
01:42:33,465 --> 01:42:36,160
I think I'm going to be sick.
Is there...

1337
01:42:36,295 --> 01:42:38,796
any special cream I could put
under my nose for the stench?

1338
01:42:38,932 --> 01:42:39,994
The smell is awful.

1339
01:42:40,129 --> 01:42:41,527
No, there's no...

1340
01:42:42,426 --> 01:42:43,924
special cream.

1341
01:42:44,059 --> 01:42:47,395
Just try again.
Just calm down and try again.

1342
01:42:48,734 --> 01:42:50,494
Can you not watch me?

1343
01:42:50,963 --> 01:42:52,164
If that's okay.

1344
01:43:16,101 --> 01:43:18,329
Dear Martin Lowe,

1345
01:43:20,098 --> 01:43:22,032
take life from these hands.

1346
01:43:23,161 --> 01:43:24,593
Open your eyes.

1347
01:43:38,998 --> 01:43:40,491
Anna, that's enough.

1348
01:43:40,626 --> 01:43:41,746
There's no point
pressing on.

1349
01:43:41,865 --> 01:43:43,197
Andrew, let's go.

1350
01:43:44,861 --> 01:43:46,759
Thank you very much, Anna.
Such a shame.

1351
01:43:46,894 --> 01:43:48,729
Ms. Emily, can I try
with some other...?

1352
01:43:48,865 --> 01:43:49,990
A woman maybe?

1353
01:43:50,126 --> 01:43:51,540
Hey, hey.
Thank you very much, Anna.

1354
01:43:51,564 --> 01:43:53,197
Please, get up.

1355
01:43:56,331 --> 01:43:59,164
Sadly, no,
it wasn't.

1356
01:44:00,962 --> 01:44:02,164
Right.

1357
01:44:03,497 --> 01:44:06,296
Yes, we're leaving
the morgue now.

1358
01:44:08,066 --> 01:44:09,857
We thought
we'd head back tomorrow,

1359
01:44:09,993 --> 01:44:11,560
so we're not driving
through the night.

1360
01:44:12,467 --> 01:44:13,467
Yes.

1361
01:44:14,926 --> 01:44:17,032
Yes, we think
that's best, too.

1362
01:44:20,035 --> 01:44:22,197
Yes, she's right here
beside me.

1363
01:44:23,699 --> 01:44:25,098
Yes, she's fine.

1364
01:44:25,567 --> 01:44:26,725
We're both fine.

1365
01:44:28,533 --> 01:44:30,200
Um...

1366
01:44:30,335 --> 01:44:33,095
We have water to last till
tomorrow, it'll be enough.

1367
01:44:33,230 --> 01:44:35,428
It's around a half a gallon.

1368
01:44:37,666 --> 01:44:38,730
All right.

1369
01:44:38,866 --> 01:44:40,494
Thank you. Bye, Aka.

1370
01:44:45,264 --> 01:44:46,792
I know
we're going to find her.

1371
01:44:46,928 --> 01:44:49,093
I'm kind of relieved
that wasn't her.

1372
01:44:49,229 --> 01:44:50,729
I didn't like her face.

1373
01:44:50,864 --> 01:44:51,864
No humility.

1374
01:45:11,159 --> 01:45:13,833
I knew she wasn't the one
we were looking for.

1375
01:45:13,968 --> 01:45:15,593
I just didn't want
to tell you.

1376
01:45:17,732 --> 01:45:18,732
I mean it.

1377
01:45:19,725 --> 01:45:21,198
I had a dream last night.

1378
01:45:22,101 --> 01:45:23,209
I didn't want
to tell you before,

1379
01:45:23,233 --> 01:45:24,341
because I didn't want
to upset you

1380
01:45:24,365 --> 01:45:25,659
but I can tell you
about it now.

1381
01:45:28,697 --> 01:45:31,897
I was in a big,
beautiful rectangular pool.

1382
01:45:32,032 --> 01:45:33,958
The pool had a diving board.

1383
01:45:34,094 --> 01:45:35,870
Anyway, that's not important.
What's important is

1384
01:45:35,894 --> 01:45:37,374
I was stuck
at the bottom of the pool.

1385
01:45:38,894 --> 01:45:40,408
<i>My hair was caught
in the filtration pump</i>

1386
01:45:40,432 --> 01:45:41,639
<i>and I couldn't reach
the surface,</i>

1387
01:45:41,663 --> 01:45:43,425
<i>but for some reason
I could hold my breath</i>

1388
01:45:43,560 --> 01:45:44,999
<i>underwater indefinitely.</i>

1389
01:45:46,196 --> 01:45:47,825
I was getting desperate.

1390
01:45:47,960 --> 01:45:49,990
Convinced I would die
of hunger and thirst

1391
01:45:50,126 --> 01:45:51,601
that no one would realize
what had happened

1392
01:45:51,625 --> 01:45:53,198
before it was too late.

1393
01:45:53,334 --> 01:45:54,830
<i>When suddenly
music started playing</i>

1394
01:45:54,966 --> 01:45:56,395
<i>from the pool speakers.</i>

1395
01:45:57,064 --> 01:45:58,232
A few seconds later,

1396
01:45:58,367 --> 01:46:00,263
two figures launched
themselves into the water.

1397
01:46:00,965 --> 01:46:02,266
<i>It was two women.</i>

1398
01:46:02,402 --> 01:46:04,262
<i>Synchronized swimmers
in spectacular swimsuits</i>

1399
01:46:04,398 --> 01:46:06,161
<i>who had just
started their routine.</i>

1400
01:46:06,296 --> 01:46:07,863
<i>They looked a lot alike.</i>

1401
01:46:07,999 --> 01:46:09,297
<i>They may well have been twins.</i>

1402
01:46:09,433 --> 01:46:11,077
Although I couldn't really
tell you for sure

1403
01:46:11,101 --> 01:46:12,209
because it's
one of those sports

1404
01:46:12,233 --> 01:46:14,262
where everyone wears
identical things

1405
01:46:14,398 --> 01:46:15,473
and they have
identical bodies,

1406
01:46:15,497 --> 01:46:17,132
and so they always
look like twins.

1407
01:46:18,235 --> 01:46:19,957
<i>During one of their
underwater tricks,</i>

1408
01:46:20,092 --> 01:46:21,828
<i>one of the two women
spotted me.</i>

1409
01:46:21,964 --> 01:46:22,964
To her credit,

1410
01:46:23,100 --> 01:46:24,598
she stopped
the routine immediately,

1411
01:46:24,734 --> 01:46:25,924
<i>swam down to me,</i>

1412
01:46:26,059 --> 01:46:27,363
<i>drawing a knife
from her swimsuit</i>

1413
01:46:27,499 --> 01:46:29,897
<i>and cutting my hair,
setting me free.</i>

1414
01:46:30,033 --> 01:46:31,264
<i>That's the woman, Andrew.</i>

1415
01:46:31,399 --> 01:46:33,330
<i>That's the woman
we're looking for.</i>

1416
01:46:33,466 --> 01:46:35,128
<i>She didn't look
anything like Anna,</i>

1417
01:46:35,264 --> 01:46:36,999
so I knew she wasn't the one.

1418
01:46:42,792 --> 01:46:44,089
<i>You want some water?</i>

1419
01:46:44,725 --> 01:46:46,032
<i>No, thank you.</i>

1420
01:46:47,393 --> 01:46:48,657
<i>I'm hungry.</i>

1421
01:46:48,792 --> 01:46:49,952
<i>Do you want to go out to eat,</i>

1422
01:46:49,993 --> 01:46:51,143
<i>or do you want to get
food here?</i>

1423
01:46:51,167 --> 01:46:53,262
I'd rather
not go out.

1424
01:46:53,398 --> 01:46:55,263
I'll call the diner
downstairs.

1425
01:46:56,130 --> 01:46:57,461
I'll go pick it up.

1426
01:47:05,765 --> 01:47:08,329
Hello. I'd like to place
an order for takeout, please.

1427
01:47:08,464 --> 01:47:10,230
What do you have available
right now?

1428
01:47:12,028 --> 01:47:13,230
Burger.

1429
01:47:13,899 --> 01:47:15,329
Grilled cheese sandwich.

1430
01:47:16,694 --> 01:47:17,929
No. No fish.
We don't eat fish.

1431
01:47:18,065 --> 01:47:19,165
And if you want my advice,

1432
01:47:19,300 --> 01:47:20,980
you should never
eat fish either. Not ever.

1433
01:47:21,031 --> 01:47:22,465
Uh... Burger for me.

1434
01:47:22,600 --> 01:47:23,600
Grilled cheese.

1435
01:47:23,726 --> 01:47:25,929
And a grilled cheese, please.

1436
01:47:26,064 --> 01:47:27,765
No, nothing to drink.

1437
01:47:27,901 --> 01:47:29,263
All right, I'll be there soon.

1438
01:47:33,659 --> 01:47:35,131
I'm going to take a shower.

1439
01:47:47,467 --> 01:47:48,467
Emily?

1440
01:49:41,993 --> 01:49:43,929
- Sorry, Andrew.
- Where were you?

1441
01:49:44,065 --> 01:49:45,398
We said we'd leave early.

1442
01:49:45,534 --> 01:49:47,444
I got up early and I went
for a drive to clear my head

1443
01:49:47,468 --> 01:49:49,238
and then I lost track of time
and I realized I was late,

1444
01:49:49,262 --> 01:49:50,463
so I came rushing back.

1445
01:49:50,598 --> 01:49:52,858
Emily, I've been waiting here
for an hour now.

1446
01:49:52,994 --> 01:49:56,032
I call you, you don't answer.
I was worried.

1447
01:49:56,168 --> 01:49:58,127
Well, I'm sorry,
I didn't see my phone.

1448
01:49:58,263 --> 01:49:59,763
Did you check out already?

1449
01:49:59,899 --> 01:50:01,158
What about the invoice?

1450
01:50:01,293 --> 01:50:02,296
I got it.

1451
01:50:02,431 --> 01:50:04,999
Is there any water left?
I'm really thirsty.

1452
01:50:15,200 --> 01:50:16,958
You know,
if you want to go see

1453
01:50:17,093 --> 01:50:20,057
your daughter and
your husband, then just go.

1454
01:50:20,192 --> 01:50:22,026
I won't say anything
to anyone, you know that.

1455
01:50:22,161 --> 01:50:23,362
I know, Andrew.

1456
01:50:27,693 --> 01:50:28,803
But I don't want to see them,

1457
01:50:28,827 --> 01:50:30,961
and if I change my mind,
I will let you know.

1458
01:50:31,096 --> 01:50:32,362
Let's make a move.

1459
01:51:20,793 --> 01:51:22,626
- Hey, buddy.
- Hi, Andrew.

1460
01:51:30,097 --> 01:51:31,560
There you are.

1461
01:51:33,626 --> 01:51:34,626
- Hi.
- Mmm.

1462
01:51:34,699 --> 01:51:36,098
Mmm.

1463
01:51:37,897 --> 01:51:39,264
Are you hungry?

1464
01:51:39,399 --> 01:51:41,227
We already ate, Omi.
Thank you.

1465
01:51:41,363 --> 01:51:42,625
Darling,
look who's here.

1466
01:51:42,760 --> 01:51:44,197
- Get up and say hello.
- Please.

1467
01:51:45,895 --> 01:51:47,568
He was afraid
you wouldn't make it back

1468
01:51:47,592 --> 01:51:48,597
before his bedtime.

1469
01:51:48,732 --> 01:51:49,824
You're late.

1470
01:51:49,960 --> 01:51:52,131
Oh, no, it's my fault.
I overslept.

1471
01:51:54,662 --> 01:51:55,862
Jack,
finish eating your fruit,

1472
01:51:55,960 --> 01:51:57,999
and then you can show
Emily your hedgehog.

1473
01:51:59,526 --> 01:52:01,027
This new candidate

1474
01:52:01,162 --> 01:52:03,097
I'm excited about.

1475
01:52:03,232 --> 01:52:06,399
She's exactly
what we're looking for.

1476
01:52:06,534 --> 01:52:07,691
Hmm.

1477
01:52:07,827 --> 01:52:10,363
Here's her details
and some cash.

1478
01:52:10,499 --> 01:52:12,179
I booked you a room
at the same motel

1479
01:52:12,295 --> 01:52:13,692
you were at last night.

1480
01:52:15,268 --> 01:52:18,424
Uh, that's enough apple
for you, Jack.

1481
01:52:18,560 --> 01:52:19,999
You don't want to overeat.

1482
01:52:22,800 --> 01:52:24,131
Show me your hedgehog.

1483
01:52:33,299 --> 01:52:35,189
Everything all right
with Emily?

1484
01:52:36,125 --> 01:52:39,329
She's a good one, I think.
Clever and keen.

1485
01:52:39,864 --> 01:52:41,197
I adore her.

1486
01:52:42,163 --> 01:52:44,329
Yes, Emily's all right.

1487
01:52:44,465 --> 01:52:47,999
A little strange sometimes,
but okay.

1488
01:52:49,431 --> 01:52:50,763
I'm quite tired
from the journey,

1489
01:52:50,899 --> 01:52:53,394
but still really horny.

1490
01:52:53,530 --> 01:52:55,758
Do you want to have sex
with me or Aka?

1491
01:52:57,497 --> 01:53:00,131
With you.
It was perfect last time.

1492
01:53:01,601 --> 01:53:04,456
Unless you've got
someone else scheduled for tonight.

1493
01:53:04,592 --> 01:53:06,231
It was good, wasn't it?

1494
01:53:06,500 --> 01:53:07,823
No.

1495
01:53:07,959 --> 01:53:10,429
There's no one else
scheduled in.

1496
01:53:10,565 --> 01:53:14,262
We both left tonight open
for you and Emily.

1497
01:53:26,365 --> 01:53:28,425
I think Andrew
has fallen for Omi.

1498
01:53:28,560 --> 01:53:29,758
- Really?
- Hmm.

1499
01:53:32,332 --> 01:53:34,899
Last night
when he was sleeping,

1500
01:53:35,035 --> 01:53:36,273
I think he was having
a wet dream.

1501
01:53:36,297 --> 01:53:38,060
It was actually
really funny.

1502
01:53:38,196 --> 01:53:39,656
He kept saying the words

1503
01:53:39,792 --> 01:53:44,098
"belly, together, Omi, feet."

1504
01:53:44,767 --> 01:53:46,125
Over and over again.

1505
01:53:46,260 --> 01:53:49,029
Well, today's his lucky day
because I just got my period,

1506
01:53:49,164 --> 01:53:50,692
so he doesn't have a choice.

1507
01:53:54,625 --> 01:53:56,024
I was nine days late.

1508
01:53:56,160 --> 01:53:58,560
I thought I was pregnant.
I even picked out names.

1509
01:54:00,493 --> 01:54:01,593
That's a shame.

1510
01:54:01,729 --> 01:54:03,233
How is everything
going with the boat?

1511
01:54:03,368 --> 01:54:06,094
The boat's almost ready.
Omi will show you tomorrow.

1512
01:54:06,230 --> 01:54:08,296
Oh, that's wonderful news.

1513
01:54:15,600 --> 01:54:16,600
Susan?

1514
01:54:18,434 --> 01:54:19,434
Susan.

1515
01:54:20,393 --> 01:54:21,724
What's happening?

1516
01:54:21,860 --> 01:54:24,329
It seems you fell asleep,
my dear.

1517
01:54:25,592 --> 01:54:27,891
I'm sorry, Omi.

1518
01:54:28,026 --> 01:54:30,564
I was waiting for Aka,
and she didn't come.

1519
01:54:30,700 --> 01:54:32,164
I fell asleep.

1520
01:54:32,765 --> 01:54:34,065
No matter.

1521
01:54:34,200 --> 01:54:37,064
Tomorrow morning,
you'll be tested,

1522
01:54:37,200 --> 01:54:38,632
and if you're clean,
you can sleep

1523
01:54:38,767 --> 01:54:40,362
with either one of us.

1524
01:54:41,360 --> 01:54:42,362
You should go.

1525
01:54:43,560 --> 01:54:44,757
I swear I didn't have sex

1526
01:54:44,893 --> 01:54:46,524
with anyone
other than you two.

1527
01:54:46,659 --> 01:54:49,094
And whoever said that I did,

1528
01:54:49,229 --> 01:54:50,463
and I know who it was,

1529
01:54:50,599 --> 01:54:53,198
he's only saying that
because he doesn't like me.

1530
01:54:53,634 --> 01:54:54,725
I believe you.

1531
01:54:57,492 --> 01:54:58,527
You should go.

1532
01:55:17,727 --> 01:55:19,659
Hello, Andrew.
Emily.

1533
01:55:24,233 --> 01:55:26,032
Andrew, would you like
to go first?

1534
01:55:27,492 --> 01:55:28,725
No, it's fine.

1535
01:56:06,134 --> 01:56:08,197
Oh, you're so
beautiful, Emily.

1536
01:56:11,195 --> 01:56:12,999
So very beautiful.

1537
01:56:14,029 --> 01:56:15,230
Thank you.

1538
01:56:16,591 --> 01:56:17,758
You are too, Omi.

1539
01:58:14,432 --> 01:58:17,593
Omi was right.
Susan is not contaminated.

1540
01:59:51,067 --> 01:59:53,062
This is the largest room
on the boat.

1541
01:59:53,197 --> 01:59:55,130
It serves as a waiting area

1542
01:59:55,266 --> 01:59:57,465
for those seeking
her blessing.

1543
01:59:57,600 --> 01:59:58,757
It's wonderful.

1544
01:59:58,893 --> 02:00:01,462
Here's where we'll store
her sculpted bust.

1545
02:00:01,598 --> 02:00:05,063
It'll be displayed
only for special occasions

1546
02:00:05,198 --> 02:00:07,265
and for limited
periods of time,

1547
02:00:07,400 --> 02:00:11,024
especially in the summer,
for obvious reasons.

1548
02:00:11,160 --> 02:00:13,797
A young artist will carve
her likeness out of ice,

1549
02:00:13,933 --> 02:00:15,631
free of charge, of course.

1550
02:00:15,767 --> 02:00:17,461
This is her bedroom.

1551
02:00:25,293 --> 02:00:26,229
And those?

1552
02:00:26,230 --> 02:00:27,396
Those are guest rooms

1553
02:00:27,532 --> 02:00:29,731
for when someone can't make it
back to shore

1554
02:00:29,866 --> 02:00:30,966
because of bad weather

1555
02:00:31,101 --> 02:00:33,232
and they have to spend
the night or,

1556
02:00:33,367 --> 02:00:35,963
when she wants someone
or other to stay with her

1557
02:00:36,099 --> 02:00:37,461
- at some point.
- Hmm.

1558
02:00:38,834 --> 02:00:41,692
Ah, this is the prayer room

1559
02:00:41,827 --> 02:00:44,032
where she'll spend
most of her time.

1560
02:00:47,396 --> 02:00:48,596
The boat
is much bigger

1561
02:00:48,729 --> 02:00:51,197
than I thought it would be.
It's fantastic.

1562
02:00:52,134 --> 02:00:53,699
And the name
is really wonderful.

1563
02:00:53,834 --> 02:00:55,692
Jack doesn't think so.

1564
02:00:55,828 --> 02:00:57,724
He says it doesn't
remind him of water,

1565
02:00:57,860 --> 02:01:00,297
he says it reminds him
of Santa.

1566
02:01:00,432 --> 02:01:02,961
It's time for you
to pack up some water

1567
02:01:03,097 --> 02:01:04,765
and be on your way.

1568
02:01:04,900 --> 02:01:06,230
We'll be going soon.

1569
02:01:17,125 --> 02:01:19,659
That woman over there
keeps staring at me.

1570
02:01:22,835 --> 02:01:25,263
- Do you know her?
- No.

1571
02:01:32,998 --> 02:01:34,295
Excuse me.

1572
02:01:34,431 --> 02:01:36,164
Can I have a moment
of your time?

1573
02:01:36,599 --> 02:01:37,599
Sure.

1574
02:01:38,761 --> 02:01:39,907
My name
is Rebecca King.

1575
02:01:39,931 --> 02:01:41,932
I am 29 years old.

1576
02:01:42,068 --> 02:01:44,399
I majored in literature
and now work in

1577
02:01:44,534 --> 02:01:47,962
the human resources department
of a multinational company.

1578
02:01:48,098 --> 02:01:49,923
But that's not important.

1579
02:01:50,059 --> 02:01:52,924
My sister Ruth,
she's a veterinarian.

1580
02:01:53,059 --> 02:01:56,131
Her clinic is on
Kenneth Avenue, Number 18.

1581
02:01:56,834 --> 02:01:58,758
My sister and I are twins.

1582
02:02:00,260 --> 02:02:03,527
I think my sister is the one
that you are looking for.

1583
02:02:03,663 --> 02:02:06,391
There's no need to waste
any more of your time.

1584
02:02:06,527 --> 02:02:09,164
I swear to you, it's her.

1585
02:02:11,096 --> 02:02:14,124
Um, Ms. King, hi.

1586
02:02:14,259 --> 02:02:17,558
Allow me to introduce myself.
My name is Mark Ball.

1587
02:02:17,693 --> 02:02:21,065
This is my wife,
Stephanie Ball.

1588
02:02:22,200 --> 02:02:25,230
We're here
visiting her parents.

1589
02:02:25,365 --> 02:02:27,229
Her mother's not very well,
you see.

1590
02:02:27,365 --> 02:02:30,957
And we are looking
for something actually,

1591
02:02:31,092 --> 02:02:34,261
a nice, spacious,
affordable apartment.

1592
02:02:34,396 --> 02:02:36,790
I can't quite understand
what it is

1593
02:02:36,926 --> 02:02:39,598
- you want from us.
- Listen. Emily?

1594
02:02:39,734 --> 02:02:40,858
Here's Ruth's card.

1595
02:02:40,994 --> 02:02:43,764
On the back is my address
and phone number.

1596
02:02:43,900 --> 02:02:44,940
If you met her, you'd know

1597
02:02:45,067 --> 02:02:47,296
exactly what
I'm talking about.

1598
02:02:48,458 --> 02:02:49,461
Thank you.

1599
02:02:55,992 --> 02:02:57,790
I think we should call
Omi and Aka.

1600
02:02:57,926 --> 02:02:59,126
I don't think
that's necessary.

1601
02:02:59,163 --> 02:03:00,457
She's clearly insane.

1602
02:03:00,593 --> 02:03:02,098
How did she know my name?

1603
02:03:03,667 --> 02:03:04,891
Maybe she heard me

1604
02:03:05,026 --> 02:03:07,331
calling out to you earlier.
I don't know.

1605
02:03:07,467 --> 02:03:11,164
Andrew, that woman and her
twin sister, obviously,

1606
02:03:11,299 --> 02:03:13,066
look a lot like
the woman that I saw

1607
02:03:13,202 --> 02:03:15,329
in that dream
that I was telling you about.

1608
02:03:19,033 --> 02:03:21,928
Let me just remind you, Emily,

1609
02:03:22,064 --> 02:03:23,998
in case you forgot,

1610
02:03:24,134 --> 02:03:27,164
that the woman
we're looking for,

1611
02:03:27,300 --> 02:03:29,924
her twin sister
is supposed to be dead

1612
02:03:30,059 --> 02:03:32,528
and Ms. Rebecca King
was very much alive,

1613
02:03:32,663 --> 02:03:37,331
speaking to us, no less
right here in the flesh.

1614
02:03:37,466 --> 02:03:39,659
I don't know what you saw
when you were asleep,

1615
02:03:39,794 --> 02:03:42,232
but I know what I just saw
wide awake

1616
02:03:42,367 --> 02:03:44,626
and it doesn't deserve
any more of our attention.

1617
02:04:33,834 --> 02:04:35,461
Sweetie, go say hi to Mom.

1618
02:04:46,864 --> 02:04:49,027
Sorry, Joseph. I should've
called sometime to explain.

1619
02:04:49,163 --> 02:04:50,565
It's fine.

1620
02:04:50,701 --> 02:04:52,098
Are you doing okay?

1621
02:04:56,531 --> 02:04:58,758
The little one's
starting to look like you.

1622
02:04:59,765 --> 02:05:01,032
Around here.

1623
02:05:03,834 --> 02:05:05,358
Mom, look at my new shoes.

1624
02:05:05,493 --> 02:05:08,098
- Dad just got them for me.
- Oh, they're really great.

1625
02:05:08,865 --> 02:05:09,927
I have to go now.

1626
02:05:10,063 --> 02:05:11,365
Stay a while.

1627
02:05:11,501 --> 02:05:15,131
We're going to make an omelet.
You want to eat with us?

1628
02:05:15,266 --> 02:05:16,666
I have to go.
I have an appointment.

1629
02:05:16,768 --> 02:05:17,801
But some other time maybe.

1630
02:05:17,825 --> 02:05:20,432
Please don't go.
I'm begging you.

1631
02:05:20,567 --> 02:05:22,128
Come by tonight.

1632
02:05:22,263 --> 02:05:23,525
You don't have to stay long.

1633
02:05:23,660 --> 02:05:26,032
We can just have
dinner together.

1634
02:05:27,097 --> 02:05:28,862
Come even for a bit.

1635
02:05:28,998 --> 02:05:30,659
An hour, that's all.

1636
02:05:31,559 --> 02:05:33,465
We really miss you.

1637
02:05:33,600 --> 02:05:34,600
I'll see.

1638
02:05:36,029 --> 02:05:37,863
We eat at 8:30.

1639
02:05:37,998 --> 02:05:39,461
Oh, that's a bit late.

1640
02:05:42,163 --> 02:05:43,356
Where are you staying?

1641
02:05:43,492 --> 02:05:44,494
I have to go.

1642
02:05:48,734 --> 02:05:50,565
Vanessa Weber.

1643
02:05:50,701 --> 02:05:52,796
She's 29 years old.

1644
02:05:52,931 --> 02:05:54,428
She's a waitress.

1645
02:05:55,029 --> 02:05:56,824
Twin sister,

1646
02:05:56,959 --> 02:05:58,699
died six years ago
in a car accident.

1647
02:05:58,835 --> 02:06:00,496
They were not
identical twins,

1648
02:06:00,631 --> 02:06:03,995
but I think that still
fulfills the requirement.

1649
02:06:04,131 --> 02:06:05,560
Yes, that's not a problem.

1650
02:06:09,268 --> 02:06:12,132
Who do you think
Jack's biological father is?

1651
02:06:12,268 --> 02:06:14,328
What are you talking about?
Omi, of course.

1652
02:06:14,464 --> 02:06:16,494
I don't think so.
They look nothing alike.

1653
02:06:18,162 --> 02:06:19,391
Maybe he's yours.

1654
02:06:19,526 --> 02:06:20,725
Will you cut the crap?

1655
02:06:23,799 --> 02:06:26,231
So, Vanessa...

1656
02:06:26,366 --> 02:06:29,361
<i>lives with her father.
He's 67 years old.</i>

1657
02:06:29,497 --> 02:06:31,560
Can I ask
what year you were born?

1658
02:06:32,560 --> 02:06:35,697
- 1955.
- 1955.

1659
02:06:35,833 --> 02:06:37,560
And marital status?

1660
02:06:38,458 --> 02:06:39,626
Separated.

1661
02:06:41,096 --> 02:06:42,428
Any children?

1662
02:06:44,866 --> 02:06:46,692
I had two daughters.

1663
02:06:47,731 --> 02:06:48,899
Had?

1664
02:06:49,035 --> 02:06:51,564
They both died sadly.

1665
02:06:51,700 --> 02:06:53,258
Both of them?

1666
02:06:53,393 --> 02:06:56,765
One in an automobile accident
a while back,

1667
02:06:56,901 --> 02:06:59,823
the other one three weeks ago.

1668
02:06:59,959 --> 02:07:03,263
Heart attack
just out of the blue.

1669
02:07:04,591 --> 02:07:05,626
If you...

1670
02:07:05,762 --> 02:07:08,124
don't mind my asking
one more question,

1671
02:07:08,259 --> 02:07:11,057
and you don't need to answer
if you don't want to...

1672
02:07:11,860 --> 02:07:14,428
how old were they
when they died?

1673
02:07:15,097 --> 02:07:16,929
One was 26.

1674
02:07:17,064 --> 02:07:19,531
The other one was 32.

1675
02:07:19,666 --> 02:07:20,929
They were twins.

1676
02:07:21,064 --> 02:07:23,232
Yes, we know.

1677
02:07:24,135 --> 02:07:25,765
We won't take up
any more of your time.

1678
02:07:25,900 --> 02:07:27,397
You stay strong, Mr. Weber.

1679
02:07:27,532 --> 02:07:29,966
Thank you for the tea,
and for your cooperation.

1680
02:07:30,102 --> 02:07:32,630
They really were
beautiful, Mr. Weber.

1681
02:07:32,765 --> 02:07:34,692
Tall, slim.

1682
02:07:36,060 --> 02:07:38,428
If you don't mind me asking,
how tall were they?

1683
02:07:39,996 --> 02:07:41,626
About 5'9".

1684
02:07:42,832 --> 02:07:44,263
Such a shame.

1685
02:07:46,200 --> 02:07:49,628
And they look around
130 pounds, too?

1686
02:07:50,464 --> 02:07:52,028
Such a shame.
Thank you very much,

1687
02:07:52,164 --> 02:07:53,399
Mr. Weber, for your time.

1688
02:07:53,534 --> 02:07:54,597
You're welcome.

1689
02:07:54,732 --> 02:07:55,732
Thank you.

1690
02:07:57,196 --> 02:07:58,897
Do we head back today?

1691
02:07:59,033 --> 02:08:01,231
Let's leave tomorrow morning.

1692
02:08:01,366 --> 02:08:03,593
I mean, the room's
already been paid for.

1693
02:08:04,701 --> 02:08:06,263
Unless you prefer to

1694
02:08:06,398 --> 02:08:08,261
head back today
for whatever reason?

1695
02:08:08,397 --> 02:08:10,131
No,
tomorrow morning's fine.

1696
02:08:11,033 --> 02:08:12,209
Plus,
I'm quite tired.

1697
02:08:12,233 --> 02:08:14,098
I think I'm coming down
with something.

1698
02:08:15,267 --> 02:08:18,697
I feel like a hot bath
and an early night.

1699
02:08:18,833 --> 02:08:20,131
Yes, me too.

1700
02:08:24,098 --> 02:08:25,593
I think you have a fever.

1701
02:08:26,692 --> 02:08:27,732
I'll swing by the pharmacy

1702
02:08:27,827 --> 02:08:29,896
to get a thermometer
and some pills for you.

1703
02:08:30,032 --> 02:08:31,265
There's no need.

1704
02:08:31,401 --> 02:08:33,866
No, there is. We have to get
your temperature down.

1705
02:08:34,002 --> 02:08:35,527
Cover up.
I'll be back in five.

1706
02:08:52,491 --> 02:08:53,494
Emily.

1707
02:08:58,002 --> 02:08:59,631
You didn't come over
last night.

1708
02:08:59,766 --> 02:09:01,032
I'm sorry.

1709
02:09:01,167 --> 02:09:03,763
I was working
and we finished late.

1710
02:09:03,899 --> 02:09:05,530
What are you doing here?

1711
02:09:05,665 --> 02:09:08,891
I just, uh, I came
to get some painkillers.

1712
02:09:09,027 --> 02:09:11,493
The little one hurt her foot
in ballet class.

1713
02:09:11,629 --> 02:09:13,823
Nothing serious,
but she's in some pain.

1714
02:09:13,959 --> 02:09:15,279
What happened
to her foot?

1715
02:09:15,362 --> 02:09:16,732
Is it broken? Is it swollen?

1716
02:09:16,867 --> 02:09:18,623
It's just a sprain.

1717
02:09:18,759 --> 02:09:20,962
Yeah. We iced her right away.

1718
02:09:21,097 --> 02:09:22,930
She almost didn't cry.

1719
02:09:23,065 --> 02:09:24,462
You would've been so proud.

1720
02:09:25,532 --> 02:09:27,725
Come see her tonight,
whenever you're done.

1721
02:09:28,293 --> 02:09:29,293
I'll try.

1722
02:09:31,299 --> 02:09:33,296
Let me see.

1723
02:09:34,296 --> 02:09:35,958
You really do have a fever.

1724
02:09:36,093 --> 02:09:39,565
101. But I'm sure
you'll be better by tomorrow.

1725
02:09:39,701 --> 02:09:40,757
I spoke to Aka earlier.

1726
02:09:40,893 --> 02:09:42,009
They were worried,
but I told them

1727
02:09:42,033 --> 02:09:43,461
everything is going just fine.

1728
02:09:44,196 --> 02:09:45,429
Here, drink your water.

1729
02:09:46,565 --> 02:09:48,593
We don't want you catching
pneumonia now, do we?

1730
02:09:49,894 --> 02:09:52,929
Emily, I think you're
making too much of this.

1731
02:09:53,064 --> 02:09:54,390
Try to sleep a little.

1732
02:09:54,526 --> 02:09:56,031
You need your sleep.

1733
02:09:56,167 --> 02:09:57,565
I'll be going
to bed soon, too.

1734
02:09:57,701 --> 02:09:59,230
Very tired today myself.

1735
02:10:21,229 --> 02:10:22,229
Sorry I'm late.

1736
02:10:22,299 --> 02:10:23,896
I couldn't get here
any earlier.

1737
02:10:24,032 --> 02:10:25,072
Did she go to bed already?

1738
02:10:25,197 --> 02:10:27,165
Yeah, a while ago.

1739
02:10:27,301 --> 02:10:29,395
She was really looking forward
to seeing you.

1740
02:10:31,292 --> 02:10:32,296
Come in.

1741
02:10:33,164 --> 02:10:34,527
I can't stay long.

1742
02:10:37,458 --> 02:10:38,659
How's her foot?

1743
02:10:39,800 --> 02:10:41,164
It's fine.

1744
02:10:42,000 --> 02:10:43,200
Still hurts a little, I think,

1745
02:10:43,298 --> 02:10:45,461
but she'll be all better
soon enough.

1746
02:10:48,864 --> 02:10:50,197
You hungry?

1747
02:10:50,831 --> 02:10:51,831
No.

1748
02:10:51,899 --> 02:10:53,330
Would you like a drink?

1749
02:10:53,832 --> 02:10:55,362
A cocktail, maybe?

1750
02:10:56,834 --> 02:10:58,198
I came up with one myself.

1751
02:10:58,333 --> 02:11:01,431
I drink it every night
before I go to bed.

1752
02:11:01,566 --> 02:11:06,194
Grand Marnier, whiskey,
and two drops of Angostura.

1753
02:11:06,329 --> 02:11:08,230
It's like an Old Fashioned,

1754
02:11:08,865 --> 02:11:10,329
only it's not.

1755
02:11:11,692 --> 02:11:13,626
I call it Emily's Forehead.

1756
02:11:20,259 --> 02:11:21,363
Wait.

1757
02:11:21,498 --> 02:11:24,626
Oh, uh...

1758
02:11:33,364 --> 02:11:35,623
How's everything
at the office?

1759
02:11:35,758 --> 02:11:37,263
Did you get that promotion?

1760
02:11:37,963 --> 02:11:39,828
Yeah. Um...

1761
02:11:39,963 --> 02:11:41,263
A year ago.

1762
02:11:41,732 --> 02:11:43,263
Finally got it.

1763
02:11:43,866 --> 02:11:45,725
More money, same hours.

1764
02:11:46,767 --> 02:11:48,928
Slightly bigger office.

1765
02:11:49,063 --> 02:11:50,659
It's pretty good.

1766
02:11:52,525 --> 02:11:53,758
It's all good.

1767
02:12:07,292 --> 02:12:08,395
Hey, Em,

1768
02:12:09,898 --> 02:12:11,123
did you know, um,

1769
02:12:11,259 --> 02:12:14,593
your forehead goes perfectly
with a little salmon?

1770
02:12:17,163 --> 02:12:18,999
Shall I bring you some?

1771
02:12:20,692 --> 02:12:22,461
I don't eat fish, Joseph.

1772
02:12:25,863 --> 02:12:27,065
Right.

1773
02:12:30,467 --> 02:12:31,467
So...

1774
02:12:32,559 --> 02:12:35,061
are you seeing someone,

1775
02:12:35,196 --> 02:12:36,494
is there someone else?

1776
02:12:37,460 --> 02:12:39,065
No, there's just me.

1777
02:12:41,597 --> 02:12:43,692
And you didn't say
where you're staying.

1778
02:12:45,799 --> 02:12:47,329
I have to go.

1779
02:12:50,095 --> 02:12:51,998
I'm sorry, okay?

1780
02:12:52,134 --> 02:12:54,362
I won't ask
any more questions,

1781
02:12:55,131 --> 02:12:57,131
just stay a while longer.

1782
02:12:57,734 --> 02:13:00,164
One more drink, hmm?

1783
02:13:11,035 --> 02:13:13,197
Something feels
different with...

1784
02:13:14,792 --> 02:13:17,094
Was that picture there before?

1785
02:13:17,230 --> 02:13:18,592
I haven't touched a thing.

1786
02:13:18,728 --> 02:13:21,032
Everything's
just as you left it.

1787
02:16:02,929 --> 02:16:04,131
Get in.

1788
02:16:31,798 --> 02:16:33,032
Emily,

1789
02:16:33,168 --> 02:16:34,968
I want you to know that
there's a chance those

1790
02:16:35,095 --> 02:16:38,523
contaminating fluids will be
expelled with your sweat.

1791
02:16:38,659 --> 02:16:40,296
It's been known to happen.

1792
02:16:41,095 --> 02:16:42,831
I'm hopeful.

1793
02:16:42,967 --> 02:16:44,892
I need you to be hopeful, too.

1794
02:16:45,028 --> 02:16:47,626
We'll raise the temperature
as high as it will go.

1795
02:16:48,966 --> 02:16:50,164
We'll give it our best shot.

1796
02:18:37,600 --> 02:18:38,994
How unfortunate.

1797
02:18:39,130 --> 02:18:40,999
Still contaminated.

1798
02:18:42,330 --> 02:18:44,330
It's such a shame,
all this.

1799
02:18:44,466 --> 02:18:47,298
You shouldn't have let him
defile you, Emily.

1800
02:18:47,434 --> 02:18:50,428
Here's something from
both of us to tide you over

1801
02:18:51,029 --> 02:18:52,263
until you...

1802
02:18:53,162 --> 02:18:55,032
decide what to do.

1803
02:18:56,130 --> 02:18:57,725
We're going to miss you.

1804
02:18:58,592 --> 02:18:59,824
I'm sorry.

1805
02:18:59,959 --> 02:19:02,297
There's no need
to apologize to us.

1806
02:19:02,432 --> 02:19:04,262
The only person you've hurt
is yourself.

1807
02:19:04,398 --> 02:19:06,456
You're the one
that's contaminated.

1808
02:19:06,592 --> 02:19:08,295
I disappointed you.

1809
02:19:08,431 --> 02:19:10,828
And I don't know
how it happened or why.

1810
02:19:10,963 --> 02:19:11,965
Emily,

1811
02:19:12,100 --> 02:19:14,060
maybe all this happened
for a reason.

1812
02:19:14,196 --> 02:19:15,263
Maybe it's for the best.

1813
02:19:15,399 --> 02:19:17,529
Not everyone's cut out
for everything.

1814
02:19:17,665 --> 02:19:19,725
Maybe you came into this world
to raise a daughter

1815
02:19:19,860 --> 02:19:21,035
and live in a house
with a husband.

1816
02:19:21,059 --> 02:19:23,465
- It's fine. It's no bad thing.
- No. No.

1817
02:19:23,600 --> 02:19:24,793
It's fine.

1818
02:19:24,928 --> 02:19:26,808
I'm very thirsty.
Can I have some water, please?

1819
02:19:28,063 --> 02:19:29,659
Take care, Emily.

1820
02:19:29,995 --> 02:19:31,691
Be well.

1821
02:19:31,826 --> 02:19:35,224
We'll miss you very,
very much.

1822
02:19:35,359 --> 02:19:36,692
No. No, no.

1823
02:19:47,031 --> 02:19:48,593
I have an idea.

1824
02:19:52,559 --> 02:19:53,757
If I sweat some more,

1825
02:19:53,893 --> 02:19:55,133
then my body
will cleanse itself

1826
02:19:55,200 --> 02:19:57,428
and I won't be
contaminated anymore.

1827
02:20:00,229 --> 02:20:01,725
I'm already sweating.

1828
02:20:04,764 --> 02:20:05,764
Aka!

1829
02:20:06,766 --> 02:20:08,229
Come lick me!

1830
02:20:08,365 --> 02:20:10,532
Omi, I'm not
contaminated anymore!

1831
02:20:10,668 --> 02:20:12,428
I'm not kidding! Honest!

1832
02:20:57,660 --> 02:20:58,804
When we were younger

1833
02:20:58,828 --> 02:21:01,196
I was more headstrong,
more mischievous

1834
02:21:01,332 --> 02:21:04,529
and Ruth was more quiet
and conscientious.

1835
02:21:05,465 --> 02:21:07,462
One night when we were both
at home alone,

1836
02:21:07,597 --> 02:21:10,299
our parents had left town
for three days,

1837
02:21:10,435 --> 02:21:12,964
I had this idea to have
a couple of girlfriends over.

1838
02:21:15,832 --> 02:21:19,431
<i>Once we drank almost every
drop of alcohol in the house,</i>

1839
02:21:19,567 --> 02:21:22,490
<i>I convinced them
to go skinny-dipping with me.</i>

1840
02:21:22,625 --> 02:21:23,691
Ruth was the only one

1841
02:21:23,827 --> 02:21:25,857
that hadn't had
anything to drink.

1842
02:21:25,993 --> 02:21:28,161
<i>She said that the pool
had been drained</i>

1843
02:21:28,297 --> 02:21:30,197
<i>and that it was cold out.</i>

1844
02:21:31,031 --> 02:21:32,961
But I pushed her aside,

1845
02:21:33,097 --> 02:21:34,497
took off all my clothes,

1846
02:21:34,633 --> 02:21:37,659
<i>ran to the edge of
the empty pool and dove in.</i>

1847
02:21:41,400 --> 02:21:44,496
<i>My head hit
the bottom of the pool hard.</i>

1848
02:21:45,599 --> 02:21:47,826
<i>All I remember
is the screams of the others</i>

1849
02:21:47,961 --> 02:21:49,997
<i>and my blood
going down into the drain</i>

1850
02:21:50,132 --> 02:21:51,958
<i>before losing consciousness.</i>

1851
02:21:52,093 --> 02:21:56,623
When I came to, I found myself
inside the house.

1852
02:21:56,758 --> 02:21:58,527
Ruth was sitting beside me.

1853
02:21:58,963 --> 02:22:00,995
I got up.

1854
02:22:01,130 --> 02:22:02,928
My back hurt a little.

1855
02:22:03,064 --> 02:22:04,627
I went to the bathroom.

1856
02:22:05,063 --> 02:22:06,826
I was thirsty.

1857
02:22:06,962 --> 02:22:10,590
When I looked at my face
in the mirror, I saw that

1858
02:22:10,725 --> 02:22:12,395
there wasn't even a scratch.

1859
02:22:14,363 --> 02:22:15,440
And then a few seconds later,

1860
02:22:15,464 --> 02:22:18,066
I heard Ruth's voice,
she said,

1861
02:22:18,202 --> 02:22:20,461
"You were very lucky.
You could have died."

1862
02:22:21,096 --> 02:22:22,999
And after that...

1863
02:22:23,134 --> 02:22:24,309
"We need to get
the house cleaned up

1864
02:22:24,333 --> 02:22:26,396
"because Mom and Dad
will be home soon."

1865
02:22:27,099 --> 02:22:28,966
Of course, we never told them

1866
02:22:29,101 --> 02:22:30,830
anything about it
when they got back

1867
02:22:30,965 --> 02:22:32,063
and we didn't speak of

1868
02:22:32,199 --> 02:22:34,263
what happened that night
ever again.

1869
02:22:35,900 --> 02:22:37,194
Can I get you another drink?

1870
02:22:37,330 --> 02:22:39,164
No, I'm fine, thanks.

1871
02:22:40,934 --> 02:22:43,131
You have to go see her, Emily.

1872
02:22:44,861 --> 02:22:46,039
Let's say everything
you're telling me

1873
02:22:46,063 --> 02:22:47,296
is the truth.

1874
02:22:48,365 --> 02:22:49,960
There's still
one major problem.

1875
02:22:50,095 --> 02:22:52,659
I know. I know.

1876
02:22:52,794 --> 02:22:54,194
If all the conditions
are to be met,

1877
02:22:54,262 --> 02:22:57,029
then I ought to be dead.

1878
02:22:57,164 --> 02:22:58,527
That's what you mean, right?

1879
02:23:00,230 --> 02:23:01,725
That's what I'm telling you.

1880
02:23:02,768 --> 02:23:04,395
I really ought to be dead.

1881
02:23:33,292 --> 02:23:34,296
Hey!

1882
02:23:36,196 --> 02:23:38,528
Come here. Stay. Stay.

1883
02:23:38,897 --> 02:23:40,098
Come here.

1884
02:23:44,896 --> 02:23:46,098
Come on.

1885
02:23:46,764 --> 02:23:47,764
Come on.

1886
02:24:01,426 --> 02:24:03,329
Hi. What happened?

1887
02:24:04,396 --> 02:24:06,429
We were out for a walk and...

1888
02:24:06,565 --> 02:24:08,758
two strays attacked her.

1889
02:24:09,959 --> 02:24:11,692
She didn't even have time
to react.

1890
02:24:12,634 --> 02:24:13,999
Come on back.

1891
02:24:20,930 --> 02:24:22,362
How old is she?

1892
02:24:23,292 --> 02:24:24,296
Five.

1893
02:24:25,164 --> 02:24:26,861
She looks older than five.

1894
02:24:26,996 --> 02:24:28,062
I mean six.

1895
02:24:28,197 --> 02:24:29,999
Sorry, I'm really shaken up.

1896
02:24:32,625 --> 02:24:34,131
And what's her name?

1897
02:24:35,292 --> 02:24:36,296
Linda.

1898
02:24:38,993 --> 02:24:41,395
Who's a brave girl, Linda?

1899
02:24:41,998 --> 02:24:43,593
Who's a brave girl?

1900
02:24:44,329 --> 02:24:46,456
This dog is like my family.

1901
02:24:46,591 --> 02:24:47,725
She's all I have.

1902
02:24:48,892 --> 02:24:50,329
I'm not sure
if you can relate.

1903
02:24:52,268 --> 02:24:53,974
If you don't mind my asking,
are you married?

1904
02:24:53,998 --> 02:24:55,290
Do you have children?

1905
02:24:55,425 --> 02:24:56,465
No.

1906
02:24:56,600 --> 02:24:57,725
No children.

1907
02:24:58,526 --> 02:24:59,959
Her wound goes deep.

1908
02:25:00,094 --> 02:25:02,499
Those dogs that attacked her
must have been vicious.

1909
02:25:02,634 --> 02:25:03,725
They really were.

1910
02:25:05,263 --> 02:25:06,691
Is she on any medication?

1911
02:25:06,826 --> 02:25:08,527
Does she have
any other health issues?

1912
02:25:08,995 --> 02:25:10,164
No.

1913
02:25:12,729 --> 02:25:15,397
So this is what you use
to weigh the animals?

1914
02:25:15,533 --> 02:25:17,298
Yes.

1915
02:25:17,433 --> 02:25:20,692
Twice daily with food,
and this is for the pain.

1916
02:25:22,363 --> 02:25:24,791
I don't know how to thank you.

1917
02:25:24,927 --> 02:25:27,032
I just hope
everything turns out okay.

1918
02:25:43,193 --> 02:25:44,197
Go.

1919
02:26:02,932 --> 02:26:04,458
What are you doing here?

1920
02:26:04,593 --> 02:26:06,032
Have you been following me?

1921
02:26:06,167 --> 02:26:07,527
Have you completely
lost your mind?

1922
02:26:07,566 --> 02:26:09,235
Emily, I'm sorry about
what happened the other night.

1923
02:26:09,259 --> 02:26:11,764
Please, Joseph, just leave.
I never want to see you.

1924
02:26:11,900 --> 02:26:14,227
I came here to apologize.

1925
02:26:14,362 --> 02:26:16,263
We both had a lot to drink.

1926
02:26:17,064 --> 02:26:18,659
I really missed you.

1927
02:26:19,633 --> 02:26:20,757
Please, just...

1928
02:26:20,893 --> 02:26:22,626
just come say hi
to the little one.

1929
02:26:23,758 --> 02:26:25,263
You brought the little one?

1930
02:26:28,326 --> 02:26:29,326
Okay, fine.

1931
02:26:29,732 --> 02:26:31,064
Let's go.

1932
02:26:36,095 --> 02:26:37,594
Hi, darling.

1933
02:26:38,263 --> 02:26:40,527
Hi, I'm so happy to see you.

1934
02:26:42,867 --> 02:26:44,496
I have some wonderful news.

1935
02:26:44,632 --> 02:26:47,263
Do you remember the woman
that I was looking for?

1936
02:26:47,732 --> 02:26:49,290
I found her.

1937
02:26:49,425 --> 02:26:50,626
Mommy found her.

1938
02:26:51,831 --> 02:26:53,032
How's your foot?

1939
02:26:53,632 --> 02:26:54,758
My foot?

1940
02:26:55,633 --> 02:26:57,461
It's fine.

1941
02:26:58,329 --> 02:26:59,999
That's good to hear.

1942
02:27:00,135 --> 02:27:02,730
Now, do you know
how much of your body

1943
02:27:02,865 --> 02:27:04,692
is actually water?

1944
02:27:06,162 --> 02:27:08,565
Around 70% water.

1945
02:27:08,701 --> 02:27:10,065
Isn't that amazing?

1946
02:27:10,866 --> 02:27:12,329
And what about a potato?

1947
02:27:13,358 --> 02:27:15,295
76%.

1948
02:27:15,431 --> 02:27:19,461
And a bell pepper
is 93.4% water.

1949
02:27:21,726 --> 02:27:23,692
And what about a man's sperm?

1950
02:27:25,164 --> 02:27:26,896
Why don't I just tell you?

1951
02:27:27,031 --> 02:27:28,961
It's around 90% water.

1952
02:27:29,096 --> 02:27:30,795
And that's why...

1953
02:27:30,930 --> 02:27:32,329
as your mother,

1954
02:27:32,465 --> 02:27:34,991
I'd like to give you
a piece of advice.

1955
02:27:35,127 --> 02:27:38,091
And I want you to promise me
that you'll follow it.

1956
02:27:38,227 --> 02:27:43,428
I want you to stay as far away
from Daddy as possible.

1957
02:27:44,527 --> 02:27:46,830
He's contaminated, sadly.

1958
02:27:46,965 --> 02:27:49,927
His sweat, his sperm,

1959
02:27:50,063 --> 02:27:52,025
his genitals,

1960
02:27:52,160 --> 02:27:56,296
all the water that's inside
of him is contaminated.

1961
02:27:56,431 --> 02:27:59,230
And I don't want him
contaminating you, too.

1962
02:28:15,533 --> 02:28:16,598
Hello?

1963
02:28:16,733 --> 02:28:17,733
<i>Emily?</i>

1964
02:28:19,033 --> 02:28:20,429
- Yes?
<i>- Hello.</i>

1965
02:28:20,564 --> 02:28:22,726
<i>I heard you met Ruth.
I'm so glad.</i>

1966
02:28:22,861 --> 02:28:24,181
<i>Listen, Emily,
I'm calling because</i>

1967
02:28:24,234 --> 02:28:26,896
<i>I wanted to give you
some really good news.</i>

1968
02:28:27,032 --> 02:28:29,128
<i>Remember that problem of ours?</i>

1969
02:28:29,264 --> 02:28:30,494
<i>It's all been sorted out.</i>

1970
02:28:33,033 --> 02:28:34,463
<i>Emily, are you still there?</i>

1971
02:28:34,599 --> 02:28:35,599
Yes.

1972
02:28:36,794 --> 02:28:39,395
How has it been
sorted out exactly?

1973
02:29:00,560 --> 02:29:02,025
Emily, welcome.

1974
02:29:02,160 --> 02:29:04,399
Did you find it okay?
I hope it wasn't any trouble.

1975
02:29:04,534 --> 02:29:05,534
No trouble.

1976
02:29:05,797 --> 02:29:06,999
Come in.

1977
02:29:10,165 --> 02:29:11,795
Would you like
some tea?

1978
02:29:11,931 --> 02:29:13,263
No, thank you.

1979
02:29:14,932 --> 02:29:17,329
I'm all ears, Rebecca.

1980
02:29:17,465 --> 02:29:18,966
Just two more minutes
and you'll know

1981
02:29:19,101 --> 02:29:21,164
exactly how it's all
been sorted out.

1982
02:29:22,167 --> 02:29:23,664
At least try
one of the cookies.

1983
02:29:23,800 --> 02:29:24,800
They're still warm.

1984
02:30:09,229 --> 02:30:10,991
Hi. Remember me?

1985
02:30:11,126 --> 02:30:13,006
I came to you the other day
with an injured dog.

1986
02:30:13,060 --> 02:30:15,423
- Of course, I remember you.
- Her name was Mary.

1987
02:30:15,559 --> 02:30:16,560
I thought it was Linda.

1988
02:30:17,491 --> 02:30:18,524
I call her Mary.

1989
02:30:18,659 --> 02:30:20,263
My husband calls her Linda.

1990
02:30:21,528 --> 02:30:22,808
I'm sorry
to show up unannounced.

1991
02:30:22,835 --> 02:30:24,427
I'm just leaving town shortly

1992
02:30:24,563 --> 02:30:26,463
and I wanted to give you
a gift before I go

1993
02:30:26,599 --> 02:30:29,432
just to thank you for
everything you did for Mary.

1994
02:30:29,567 --> 02:30:30,567
She's fine now.

1995
02:30:30,701 --> 02:30:32,830
I'm so glad. Thank you.

1996
02:30:32,966 --> 02:30:34,428
You really shouldn't have.

1997
02:30:40,560 --> 02:30:42,032
Would you like to come in?

1998
02:30:43,035 --> 02:30:44,990
I don't know
if you wear scarves

1999
02:30:45,126 --> 02:30:46,899
but I picked this one out
because it's silk

2000
02:30:47,035 --> 02:30:49,031
and it has various
animals on it,

2001
02:30:49,167 --> 02:30:51,362
you know,
like your profession.

2002
02:30:52,633 --> 02:30:53,895
I love scarves.

2003
02:30:54,030 --> 02:30:55,461
Thank you so much.

2004
02:30:57,600 --> 02:31:00,494
I'm going to get that coffee.
It must be ready by now.

2005
02:31:15,701 --> 02:31:17,098
Oh, thank you so much.

2006
02:31:22,899 --> 02:31:23,899
Will you do me a favor?

2007
02:31:24,035 --> 02:31:26,294
Will you just try
this scarf on?

2008
02:31:26,429 --> 02:31:28,065
It took me ages
to pick it out.

2009
02:31:28,201 --> 02:31:29,641
There were actually
four that I liked

2010
02:31:29,699 --> 02:31:32,189
and I'm just curious to see
if I made the right choice.

2011
02:31:32,325 --> 02:31:33,327
Wow.

2012
02:31:33,329 --> 02:31:35,725
It's beautiful. I love it.

2013
02:31:37,167 --> 02:31:38,273
I don't think
it really goes with

2014
02:31:38,297 --> 02:31:39,590
what I'm wearing today though.

2015
02:31:39,726 --> 02:31:41,593
Oh, I think it goes perfectly.

2016
02:31:42,296 --> 02:31:44,089
Do you mind if I just...?

2017
02:31:44,959 --> 02:31:47,098
Just to see
how it looks on you.

2018
02:31:47,896 --> 02:31:49,098
Okay.

2019
02:31:57,701 --> 02:31:59,560
Ah! Ow.

2020
02:32:00,229 --> 02:32:02,593
What the heck was that?

2021
02:33:29,095 --> 02:33:30,296
There he is.

2022
02:33:46,625 --> 02:33:48,032
Ruth, wake up.

2023
02:33:49,292 --> 02:33:50,296
Wake up.

2024
02:33:52,731 --> 02:33:53,731
Ruth.

2025
02:33:54,767 --> 02:33:56,164
Put your hand on him.

2026
02:33:56,897 --> 02:33:58,098
Touch him.

2027
02:34:03,127 --> 02:34:06,230
Say, "Take life from my hands,
and open your eyes."

2028
02:34:07,263 --> 02:34:09,598
Say it, Ruth. Ruth, wake up.

2029
02:34:09,734 --> 02:34:12,065
Wake up. Please wake up.

2030
02:34:15,929 --> 02:34:17,131
Ruth.

2031
02:34:17,767 --> 02:34:19,527
Put your hand on him.

2032
02:34:22,359 --> 02:34:23,362
Touch him.

2033
02:34:33,558 --> 02:34:35,032
What is his name?

2034
02:34:37,430 --> 02:34:39,527
I told you his name.
Touch him.

2035
02:34:41,599 --> 02:34:42,599
Say it.

2036
02:34:45,296 --> 02:34:47,461
Say his fucking name, Ruth!

2037
02:34:49,434 --> 02:34:50,434
Say it.

you have no idea.

You need water?

2059

You must be so thirsty.
I have water with me.

2060

Hang on.

2061
02:37:08,865 --> 02:37:10,065
Ruth?

Ruth?

2063

Ruth?

2064
02:39:37,894 --> 02:39:40,032
- Thank you. Thank you.
- You're welcome.
