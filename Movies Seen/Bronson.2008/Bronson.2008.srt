2
00:00:33,631 --> 00:00:35,530
My name is Charles Bronson.

3
00:00:37,481 --> 00:00:40,445
And all my life I wanted to be famous.

4
00:00:52,343 --> 00:00:55,004
<i> I knew I was made for better things </ i></i>

5
00:00:58,709 --> 00:00:59,925
<i> I had a calling. </ i></i>

6
00:01:03,148 --> 00:01:06,022
<i> I just didn't know... what it is. </ i></i>

7
00:01:09,874 --> 00:01:10,865
<i> Wasn't singing </ i></i>

8
00:01:14,256 --> 00:01:15,764
<i> ...I can fucking hit... </ i></i>

9
00:01:18,205 --> 00:01:22,508
Kinda running out of choices really...
aren't we?

10
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
<i> Baby it's slow </i>

11
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:07,000
<i> When lights go low </i>

12
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,000
<i> There's no help, no... </i>

13
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,000
<i> Baby it's slow </i>

14
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:37,000
<i> When lights go low </i>

15
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:45,000
<i> There's no help, no... </i>

16
00:02:54,600 --> 00:03:00,000
<i> He's drilling thru the Spiritus Sanctus tonight </i>

17
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,500
<i> through the dark hip falls </i>

18
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:08,000
<i> screaming "Oh you mambos!" </i>

19
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:14,000
<i> "Kill me! and kill me! and kill me!" </i>

20
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,200
<i> If I jerk the handle </i>

21
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:24,700
<i> You'll die in your dreams </i>

22
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:31,000
<i> If I jerk the handle
jerk the handle </i>

23
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:38,000
<i> You'll thrill me and thrill me and thrill me... </i>

24
00:04:21,007 --> 00:04:23,932
<i> How else can I explain it? </ i></i>

25
00:04:30,850 --> 00:04:35,335
<i> There was nothing wonky about my upbringing,
my parents were decent... </ I></i>

26
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:39,429
<i> respectable and upstanding
members of society. </ I></i>

27
00:04:41,039 --> 00:04:44,338
<i> I went to school.
I kept my head down. </ I></i>

28
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:47,864
<i> Sure like most kids
I'm going to trouble. </ i></i>

29
00:04:49,052 --> 00:04:50,214
Bastard!

30
00:04:51,044 --> 00:04:52,316
<i> I loved to... </ i></i>

31
00:05:10,587 --> 00:05:11,756
Oh Michael!?

32
00:05:12,485 --> 00:05:14,718
Mrs. Peterson I really must talk to you about...

33
00:05:16,726 --> 00:05:17,952
But I wasn't bad.

34
00:05:19,047 --> 00:05:20,211
Wasn't bad bad.

35
00:05:21,843 --> 00:05:23,355
And I still had my principles.

36
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:30,310
<i> I took the first job I could get my hands on. </ i></i>

37
00:05:31,513 --> 00:05:33,062
Put the fries Peterson.

38
00:05:35,456 --> 00:05:37,526
<i> I suppose the crumpet wasn't bad. </ i></i>

39
00:06:08,092 --> 00:06:09,134
Mrs. Peterson?

40
00:06:10,116 --> 00:06:11,840
We'd like to have a word with your son...

41
00:06:14,965 --> 00:06:15,711
Michael.

42
00:06:20,860 --> 00:06:21,840
Michael Peterson?

43
00:06:24,709 --> 00:06:25,117
Right.

44
00:06:25,777 --> 00:06:30,368
Yeah, before I forget,
I did come into this world as Michael Peterson.

45
00:06:30,411 --> 00:06:32,683
But I go out with my fighting name.

46
00:06:33,728 --> 00:06:35,258
Charlie Bronson.

47
00:06:41,892 --> 00:06:43,743
Which is my alter ego.

48
00:06:55,327 --> 00:06:57,025
<i> 1974. </ i></i>

49
00:06:58,587 --> 00:07:00,404
<i> tough time to be young in England. </ i></i>

50
00:07:02,016 --> 00:07:03,796
<i> Not a lot of opportunity around. </ i></i>

51
00:07:06,566 --> 00:07:06,991
<i> Still... </ i></i>

52
00:07:08,358 --> 00:07:09,445
<i> life moves on </ i></i>

53
00:07:11,754 --> 00:07:13,485
<i> Irene and I got hitched </ i></i>

54
00:07:14,522 --> 00:07:19,513
<i> It was alright...
we didn't have it bad for a couple from the chippy. </ i></i>

55
00:07:20,735 --> 00:07:25,379
But they don't give you a star on
The Walk of Fame for not paying.
Do they?

56
00:07:35,392 --> 00:07:37,096
Michael!
What is that noise?!

57
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
For God's sake...

58
00:07:46,724 --> 00:07:51,066
So... this is the post office I did over...

59
00:07:52,529 --> 00:07:54,581
<i> This is what I got away with... </ i></i>

60
00:07:56,858 --> 00:07:58,435
And this is what they gave me...

61
00:07:59,844 --> 00:08:00,914
Seven years.

62
00:08:02,864 --> 00:08:06,050
<i> Don't worry son... you won't do the seven... </ i></i>

63
00:08:06,394 --> 00:08:07,613
You'll be out in four.

64
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:21,000
How's it going anyway? Heh?

65
00:09:21,889 --> 00:09:23,382
Go on!
How's it going?!

66
00:09:25,139 --> 00:09:27,526
I've always fancied myself as
a bit of a comedian.

67
00:09:28,554 --> 00:09:29,782
Seven years...

68
00:09:31,563 --> 00:09:33,329
Is a long time...

69
00:09:38,586 --> 00:09:41,486
Now I'm not going to stand here,
and tell you...

70
00:09:41,611 --> 00:09:47,190
Eh... Tell you...
That prison is not bad.

71
00:09:47,622 --> 00:09:48,273
No.

72
00:09:48,575 --> 00:09:52,169
That would be misrepresenting myself
and I think enough of that has been done already!

73
00:09:52,294 --> 00:09:53,235
Don't you?!

74
00:09:54,223 --> 00:09:54,821
No.

75
00:09:59,761 --> 00:10:04,813
<i> You see, I didn't see a cell, a cage, or a box </ i></i>

76
00:10:06,855 --> 00:10:09,810
<i> To me it was a hotel room </ i></i>

77
00:10:24,976 --> 00:10:26,454
<i> Don't get me wrong... </ i></i>

78
00:10:26,769 --> 00:10:28,443
<i> For most people... </ i></i>

79
00:10:29,269 --> 00:10:31,486
<i> prison is tough. </ i></i>

80
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:35,070
<i> A monotonous nightmare </ i></i>

81
00:10:36,494 --> 00:10:38,518
<i> 24 hours a day. </ i></i>

82
00:10:40,250 --> 00:10:42,032
<i> 7 days a week. </ i></i>

83
00:10:43,555 --> 00:10:46,771
<i> 365 days a year </ i></i>

84
00:10:46,789 --> 00:10:50,191
<i> of pure unadulterated living... </ i></i>

85
00:10:50,709 --> 00:10:53,327
<i> breathing... hell. </ i></i>

86
00:10:58,361 --> 00:10:59,285
<i> But for me... </ i></i>

87
00:11:01,425 --> 00:11:05,315
prison was finally a place where I could
sharp my tools...

88
00:11:06,781 --> 00:11:08,215
hone my skills...

89
00:11:10,076 --> 00:11:14,303
It's like a battleground, ain't it?
It was an opportunity...

90
00:11:14,705 --> 00:11:18,627
and a place where soon every native
was going to know my name.

91
00:11:31,898 --> 00:11:33,148
What's the matter Charlie?

92
00:11:34,607 --> 00:11:37,302
- You want me to take you through it again?
- No.

93
00:11:38,312 --> 00:11:41,778
- Me don't do work in longterm prisons.
- It's vocational training.

94
00:11:41,779 --> 00:11:43,887
- So you can get a job when you get...
- Fuck off!

95
00:12:05,945 --> 00:12:09,811
- What's the problem Peterson?
- Problem?

96
00:12:10,626 --> 00:12:13,386
I said "What's the problem, Peterson?"

97
00:12:14,983 --> 00:12:16,385
I don't know,
I don't have a problem.

98
00:12:50,671 --> 00:12:52,199
For sure there mate!

99
00:13:46,462 --> 00:13:49,195
- Would you like a cup o' tea mate?
- Thanks Mickey, love one.

100
00:13:49,484 --> 00:13:51,912
- Milk and sugar?
- Please.

101
00:13:52,037 --> 00:13:53,660
- How many sugars?
- Two.

102
00:14:02,858 --> 00:14:06,797
<i> ...are you upon my knee </ i></i>

103
00:14:06,922 --> 00:14:10,769
<i> Tea for two
and two for tea </ i></i>

104
00:14:11,109 --> 00:14:15,897
<i> Just me for you and you for me... </ i></i>

105
00:14:16,219 --> 00:14:17,866
<i> hello... </ i></i>

106
00:14:20,723 --> 00:14:22,454
And would you like a
cup o' tea too mate?

107
00:14:24,721 --> 00:14:27,912
Nothing close to my heart than a good cup
of british char.

108
00:14:28,354 --> 00:14:30,850
- Milk and sugar?
- No, I like it dark.

109
00:14:37,081 --> 00:14:40,477
That's an impressive set of guns you have there
you must be handy in a brawl.

110
00:14:40,602 --> 00:14:42,721
Bam! Bam! Knock-out...

111
00:14:43,265 --> 00:14:44,216
Ding Ding...

112
00:14:52,871 --> 00:14:53,936
Very nice.

113
00:15:06,430 --> 00:15:09,775
Time stops for no man
ladies and germs.

114
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:11,778
My time was coming up!

115
00:15:12,729 --> 00:15:13,781
Parole!

116
00:15:16,735 --> 00:15:19,791
And just when I was about to make
a name to be reckoned with...

117
00:15:21,580 --> 00:15:24,325
- Oh yeah? As what?
- As what!?

118
00:15:27,227 --> 00:15:30,773
You don't want to be trapped inside
with me sunshine.

119
00:15:32,721 --> 00:15:36,953
Inside I'm someone nobody wants to fuck with.
Do you understand?

120
00:15:43,347 --> 00:15:45,096
I'm Charlie Bronson.

121
00:15:47,201 --> 00:15:49,765
I am Britain's most violent prisoner.

122
00:15:57,048 --> 00:15:59,178
<i> Prison was... </ i></i>

123
00:15:59,178 --> 00:16:00,861
<i> honestly... </i>

124
00:16:00,986 --> 00:16:02,339
Brilliant!

125
00:16:02,464 --> 00:16:05,592
I liked it personally, oh fuck that!
I loved it!

126
00:16:05,662 --> 00:16:07,311
It was exciting!

127
00:16:07,687 --> 00:16:08,907
It was on the edge...

128
00:16:09,032 --> 00:16:10,320
It was magnus

129
00:16:10,338 --> 00:16:12,549
at it's very best.

130
00:16:26,653 --> 00:16:31,147
Problem is, once you get comfortable
or sometimes even before, they ghost you

131
00:16:31,165 --> 00:16:33,303
again and again...

132
00:16:33,799 --> 00:16:37,051
<i> moving you from prison to prison...
to prison... </ i></i>

133
00:16:38,007 --> 00:16:39,522
And I fucking hate that.

134
00:16:41,135 --> 00:16:44,017
<i> Parkhurst.
God bless that place. </ I></i>

135
00:16:44,516 --> 00:16:48,270
<i> The accommodation was more than worthy
of my royal self. </ i></i>

136
00:16:49,140 --> 00:16:50,048
<i> your own bed. </ i></i>

137
00:16:51,659 --> 00:16:54,102
<i> Toilet...
a sink... </ i></i>

138
00:16:55,188 --> 00:16:58,300
<i> The food was of exceptional standard. </ i></i>

139
00:17:01,804 --> 00:17:04,295
Yes, Parkhurst was ????.

140
00:17:04,567 --> 00:17:09,285
<i> And how prison rule, what can I say?
Well worth a visit. </ i></i>

141
00:17:10,269 --> 00:17:13,341
<i> ?????
not my favorite place to visit </ i></i>

142
00:17:13,466 --> 00:17:18,702
<i> but the staff are ready to make your stay
as memorable as possible. </ i></i>

143
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:23,557
<i> Swell ah? 
How we laughed...</i>

144
00:17:58,719 --> 00:18:05,000
Please release me

145
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Oh let me go

146
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:15,000
'Cause I don't love you

147
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
anymore...

148
00:18:23,117 --> 00:18:24,525
In the end I got it wrong...

149
00:18:25,490 --> 00:18:27,255
quite seriously wrong actually...

150
00:18:27,932 --> 00:18:29,135
They sent me here.

151
00:18:30,804 --> 00:18:31,960
The funny farm.

152
00:20:29,503 --> 00:20:34,345
Right Peterson, now that you've had
the chance to cool down,
I'll explain the Rampton rules.

153
00:20:34,901 --> 00:20:37,712
Rule #1:
You do as you're told.

154
00:20:39,956 --> 00:20:41,043
Rule #2?

155
00:20:43,094 --> 00:20:44,024
This ain't prison.

156
00:20:45,164 --> 00:20:46,450
We're lion tamers here.

157
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:52,951
Right, take these pills.

158
00:20:53,594 --> 00:20:56,715
Stick 'em up your fucking ass!
yeah...

159
00:21:18,228 --> 00:21:20,184
Who you're fucking with?
You're gonna die you cunts!

160
00:21:24,103 --> 00:21:25,447
Hold him...

161
00:21:27,177 --> 00:21:31,927
You fucking cunt!
You fucking cunt!

162
00:23:08,873 --> 00:23:09,446
The thing is...

163
00:23:11,776 --> 00:23:12,793
They don't understand.

164
00:23:15,827 --> 00:23:17,122
They'll never understand.

165
00:23:19,261 --> 00:23:20,252
and that scares 'em.

166
00:23:24,677 --> 00:23:26,700
Is it the key to be rubbed up?

167
00:23:29,292 --> 00:23:31,044
What's that gonna change?

168
00:23:33,029 --> 00:23:35,000
Ain't gonna change the you inside.

169
00:23:37,541 --> 00:23:39,043
Nothing can hold the truth.

170
00:23:41,414 --> 00:23:43,945
You're not more mad than I am.

171
00:23:47,060 --> 00:23:49,689
Yeah it's all just made up,
it's rubbish.

172
00:23:55,809 --> 00:23:56,163
You.

173
00:23:58,027 --> 00:23:58,340
Me.

174
00:24:02,151 --> 00:24:02,978
9 year old girl.

175
00:24:09,275 --> 00:24:10,204
True loveology.

176
00:25:01,703 --> 00:25:05,836
<i> When I look back upon my life... </ i></i>

177
00:25:06,245 --> 00:25:09,330
<i> it's always with a sense of shame </ i></i>

178
00:25:09,782 --> 00:25:14,198
<i> I've always been the one to blame </ i></i>

179
00:25:19,547 --> 00:25:22,355
<i> For everything I long to do </ i></i>

180
00:25:23,319 --> 00:25:26,311
<i> No matter when, or where, or who </ i></i>

181
00:25:27,143 --> 00:25:30,629
<i> There's one thing in common too... </ i></i>

182

<i> It's a, it's a, it's a... </ i></i>

183
00:25:34,643 --> 00:25:36,668
<i> it's a sin </ i></i>

184
00:25:39,075 --> 00:25:40,223
<i> it's a sin </ i></i>

185
00:25:43,394 --> 00:25:45,193
<i> Everything I've ever done </ i></i>

186
00:25:45,194 --> 00:25:47,218
<i> Everything I ever do </ i></i>

187
00:25:47,219 --> 00:25:49,148
<i> Every place I've ever been </ i></i>

188
00:25:49,149 --> 00:25:51,618
<i> Everywhere I'm going to </i>

189
00:25:51,940 --> 00:25:53,358
<i> it's a sin </ i></i>

190
00:25:54,361 --> 00:25:57,490
<i> At school they taught me how to be </ i></i>

191
00:25:58,229 --> 00:26:01,408
<i> So pure in thought and word and deed </ i></i>

192
00:26:02,684 --> 00:26:05,348
<i> They didn't quite succeed </ i></i>

193
00:26:09,819 --> 00:26:13,031
<i> For everything I long to do </ i></i>

194
00:26:13,544 --> 00:26:17,126
<i> No matter when, or where, or who </ i></i>

195
00:26:17,251 --> 00:26:20,619
<i> There's one thing in common too... </ i></i>

196
00:26:21,575 --> 00:26:25,373
<i> It's a, it's a, it's a... </ i></i>

197
00:26:25,383 --> 00:26:26,981
<i> It's a sin </ i></i>

198
00:26:29,276 --> 00:26:30,451
<i> It's a sin </ i></i>

199
00:26:33,657 --> 00:26:37,126
<i> Everything I've ever done
Everything I ever do... </ i></i>

200
00:26:38,152 --> 00:26:39,086
Cunt!

201
00:27:02,056 --> 00:27:05,646
Fucking loonies they're great mate, but...

202
00:27:07,645 --> 00:27:08,636
Well...

203
00:27:10,878 --> 00:27:12,946
They're fucking loonies!
Arent they?

204
00:27:15,052 --> 00:27:17,163
And I had to get out somehow.

205
00:27:19,371 --> 00:27:22,484
<i> This was no hotel I wanted to stay at anymore. </ i></i>

206
00:27:23,688 --> 00:27:27,187
<i> Being a celebrity and all
I needed to check out... </ i></i>

207
00:27:29,629 --> 00:27:32,168
<i> And I had a good idea alright.
Do we? </ i></i>

208
00:30:34,159 --> 00:30:38,000
I will now reenact
what I like to call...

209
00:30:39,731 --> 00:30:40,757
What happens...

210
00:30:40,999 --> 00:30:43,115
when murder goes wrong...

211
00:30:49,216 --> 00:30:51,884
When do I go back?

212
00:30:54,988 --> 00:31:01,208
Now now Mr. Peterson, we aren't going to
start up all that silliness again.
Are we?

213
00:31:04,228 --> 00:31:06,347
Listen... nursie.

214
00:31:06,348 --> 00:31:08,895
I just want to know when my trial is.

215
00:31:09,425 --> 00:31:12,572
And when I head back to the slammer.

216
00:31:12,807 --> 00:31:13,720
Alright?

217
00:31:15,033 --> 00:31:17,153
Wrong! Mr. Peterson.

218
00:31:18,510 --> 00:31:20,700
Now let's not play silly bad words. Eh?

219
00:31:21,144 --> 00:31:24,971
I'll just have to pop you in the butt with one
of my special potions. Hmm...

220
00:31:29,818 --> 00:31:32,408
When's my trial?!

221
00:31:35,702 --> 00:31:36,658
Ah, ah, ah.

222
00:31:37,702 --> 00:31:38,658
No...

223
00:31:39,631 --> 00:31:43,325
Mr. White recovered dear.
There's no trial.

224
00:31:45,628 --> 00:31:46,950
Isn't that wonderful?

225
00:31:48,732 --> 00:31:51,479
However... you are being moved.

226
00:31:55,521 --> 00:31:56,043
Where?

227
00:32:01,284 --> 00:32:02,805
Yes Mr. Peterson.

228
00:32:02,930 --> 00:32:06,527
Broadmoor asylum for the criminally insane...

229
00:32:12,038 --> 00:32:14,550
I deserve to go to prison
for what I did.

230
00:32:16,297 --> 00:32:19,062
I want my hotel room back!

231
00:32:21,451 --> 00:32:24,528
Well I'm sure you'll find yourself
some solitary.

232
00:32:33,133 --> 00:32:34,637
<i> And I did... </ i></i>

233
00:32:36,871 --> 00:32:39,444
<i> 26 years. </ i></i>

234
00:32:40,199 --> 00:32:43,964
<i> 26 years in solitary I've done. </ i></i>

235
00:32:44,381 --> 00:32:46,772
<i> And I killed no one! </ i></i>

236
00:32:47,189 --> 00:32:50,683
<i> I'm not joking.
Not a soul! </ I></i>

237
00:32:51,483 --> 00:32:52,448
<i> Ever! </i>

238
00:33:01,158 --> 00:33:01,602
Well...

239
00:33:02,818 --> 00:33:03,592
I thought...

240
00:33:04,122 --> 00:33:06,956
If you're gonna be unfair with me...

241
00:33:07,912 --> 00:33:13,205
I'm gonna show you the ultimate
in unfair take-downs.

242
00:33:15,108 --> 00:33:16,255
Now this...

243
00:33:17,055 --> 00:33:21,000
is what I call "Charlie vs Broadmoor"

244
00:33:39,586 --> 00:33:43,011
<i> When I'm the Rock and Roll... </ i></i>

245
00:33:43,654 --> 00:33:46,870
<i> When I'm the Rock and Roll... </ i></i>

246
00:33:47,271 --> 00:33:51,494
<i> When I'm the Rock and Roll star... </ i></i>

247
00:33:54,634 --> 00:33:58,344
<i> When I'm a Rock and Roll... </ i></i>

248
00:33:58,469 --> 00:34:01,445
<i> When I'm a Rock and Roll... </ i></i>

249
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:08,876
<i> When I'm a Rock and Roll... </ i></i>

250
00:34:08,877 --> 00:34:12,000
<i> (super star) </ i></i>

251
00:34:30,965 --> 00:34:32,609
Well they towed me.

252
00:34:33,982 --> 00:34:37,711
Truth be told though
they didn't want me in there anymore anyway.

253
00:34:38,468 --> 00:34:41,389
Apparently, I'd managed to cost the system

254
00:34:41,514 --> 00:34:44,266
tens of millions of pounds in damage

255
00:34:44,318 --> 00:34:46,126
and her Majesty

256
00:34:46,325 --> 00:34:52,827
no longer wanted to pleasure herself
with Britain's most expensive prisoner!

257
00:34:53,828 --> 00:34:56,705
I know it's not the moniker
that I was looking for

258
00:34:57,079 --> 00:34:58,931
but what were they gonna do?

259
00:34:59,279 --> 00:35:02,198
I mean they couldn't let a loony
run around for free!

260
00:35:05,164 --> 00:35:06,390
Ow yes...

261
00:35:07,076 --> 00:35:09,701
they had a dirty trick up their sleeve

262
00:35:11,048 --> 00:35:14,865
The only way to certify me sane... ain't it?!

263
00:35:15,655 --> 00:35:19,062
So before I knew it
I was back on the streets again!

264
00:35:21,643 --> 00:35:24,468
But Charlie B. ain't no fucking pillow biter

265
00:35:24,886 --> 00:35:25,912
Oh no!

266
00:35:26,285 --> 00:35:29,423
So it was time to suck up the free air

267
00:35:29,623 --> 00:35:31,553
and see what the world had to offer me.

268
00:36:07,869 --> 00:36:09,539
Very funny boys.

269
00:36:15,843 --> 00:36:16,939
Right...

270
00:36:19,943 --> 00:36:21,039
It's been a pleasure.

271
00:36:43,543 --> 00:36:45,000
Look at you!

272
00:37:38,443 --> 00:37:39,686
Come on in, son.

273
00:37:44,424 --> 00:37:45,371
That's right...

274
00:37:45,754 --> 00:37:48,717
I'll show you your room and then
we'll have a nice cup of tea.

275
00:37:58,678 --> 00:37:59,583
Come on son...

276
00:38:00,217 --> 00:38:00,991
That's right...

277
00:38:06,988 --> 00:38:08,196
Oh... look it's me!

278
00:38:12,585 --> 00:38:13,846
I was very small.

279
00:38:26,355 --> 00:38:28,275
Where's all my stuff?

280
00:38:31,900 --> 00:38:35,239
Oh, we couldn't bring everything Michael
that was Luton.

281
00:38:38,177 --> 00:38:40,829
- Not all of it?
- Oh we kept some...

282
00:38:44,350 --> 00:38:45,549
Where is my bed?

283
00:38:46,939 --> 00:38:50,730
No, not this one the other one
who I had when I was a child.

284
00:38:53,771 --> 00:38:57,310
I couldn't keep everything Michael
we don't have the room.

285
00:39:13,555 --> 00:39:15,824
Where is my bed still in Luton?

286
00:39:17,783 --> 00:39:18,635
Luton.

287
00:39:20,365 --> 00:39:21,504
Never changes, does it?

288
00:39:23,111 --> 00:39:26,049
Now my mom once said
"Stick with what you know".

289
00:39:26,978 --> 00:39:28,387
And I knew two things...

290
00:39:29,021 --> 00:39:32,306
I knew Luton...
and I knew uncle Jack.

291
00:39:33,583 --> 00:39:35,322
And uncle Jack knew everyone.

292
00:39:36,234 --> 00:39:38,537
And anyone he didn't know
wasn't worth knowing.

293
00:39:52,149 --> 00:39:54,296
- In a holiday?
- No.

294
00:39:55,774 --> 00:39:58,261
Something better than that
I want to make a name for myself.

295
00:39:58,878 --> 00:39:59,999
Ah yeah doing what?

296
00:40:01,077 --> 00:40:02,590
Oi I'll kill the Queen.

297
00:40:03,189 --> 00:40:05,441
- So you off to London then.
- No.

298
00:40:07,431 --> 00:40:08,839
Luton's where it's at.

299
00:41:43,362 --> 00:41:47,561
Well fuck me inside out!

300
00:41:48,613 --> 00:41:52,228
Come in my dear boy,
you're just in time for cocktails.

301
00:42:05,586 --> 00:42:06,934
Luton calling...

302
00:42:07,238 --> 00:42:10,132
Ladies and gentlemen in ladies attire...

303
00:42:10,784 --> 00:42:12,836
allow me to present my favorite nephew.

304
00:42:13,071 --> 00:42:15,965
Newly relieved of her majesty's pleasure.

305
00:42:16,739 --> 00:42:17,905
Mickey Peterson.

306
00:42:20,164 --> 00:42:21,590
Sit down my dear boy.

307
00:42:26,518 --> 00:42:31,368
Miss Gorgeous here
will get you a cocktail.

308
00:42:33,209 --> 00:42:33,861
Michael

309
00:42:36,339 --> 00:42:38,234
It's very exciting to meet you.

310
00:42:39,130 --> 00:42:42,415
Our Jacky here...
he says you're quite a slept, here on the inside.

311
00:42:52,742 --> 00:42:53,524
Thank you.

312
00:42:57,329 --> 00:42:59,654
It's a complete turn-off.

313
00:43:04,329 --> 00:43:05,354
Your face, rock.

314
00:43:06,328 --> 00:43:07,884
Black-kissing a fanny.

315
00:43:11,675 --> 00:43:14,508
That's an upstanding set of mustaches.

316
00:43:15,733 --> 00:43:17,141
I admire your dedication.

317
00:43:19,488 --> 00:43:22,565
I always knew you had an artistic bent.

318
00:43:26,572 --> 00:43:27,816
So big boy...

319
00:43:30,110 --> 00:43:32,571
What does the future hold
for Michael Peterson?

320
00:44:05,648 --> 00:44:10,707
Ambition is the virtue of all great men.

321
00:44:15,096 --> 00:44:17,791
He's going to stay here with us.

322
00:44:19,651 --> 00:44:21,260
Alright my pets?

323
00:44:23,658 --> 00:44:25,067
Say the more the merrier.

324
00:44:26,249 --> 00:44:27,649
For as long as you like.

325
00:44:41,017 --> 00:44:42,590
That's very strong.

326
00:44:44,798 --> 00:44:45,650
It's wonderful.

327
00:44:48,222 --> 00:44:51,447
<i> Uncle Jack always had his ear to the ground. </ i></i>

328
00:44:52,037 --> 00:44:55,531
<i> And it turns out there was an
old prison mate minding Luton too. </ i></i>

329
00:45:03,306 --> 00:45:05,693
- Peterson.
- You smoking?!

330
00:45:05,818 --> 00:45:08,553
- Yes.
- How long did you quit?!

331
00:45:09,595 --> 00:45:12,099
- 10 years.
- Fucking hell!

332
00:45:12,486 --> 00:45:14,471
Make me a cup of tea, please.

333
00:45:24,537 --> 00:45:26,962
Let's fuck.

334
00:45:32,652 --> 00:45:33,408
So?

335
00:45:34,503 --> 00:45:35,719
Are you interested?

336
00:45:37,477 --> 00:45:39,328
Of course I fucking am!

337
00:45:42,187 --> 00:45:43,751
You're looking good Mickey.

338
00:45:44,177 --> 00:45:45,820
Fit...

339
00:45:45,831 --> 00:45:46,559
Strong...

340
00:45:48,237 --> 00:45:49,670
Powerful...

341
00:45:51,088 --> 00:45:52,878
You could make some money.

342
00:45:53,860 --> 00:45:55,825
Serious money...

343
00:45:57,555 --> 00:45:58,920
All you need's a name.

344
00:46:00,554 --> 00:46:02,110
What's wrong with Mickey Peterson?

345
00:46:02,476 --> 00:46:03,978
No, you need a...

346
00:46:03,979 --> 00:46:05,631
fighting name.

347
00:46:07,604 --> 00:46:09,430
Like a movie star.

348
00:46:26,579 --> 00:46:28,465
Charlton Heston.

349
00:46:29,342 --> 00:46:30,542
Look love...

350
00:46:31,047 --> 00:46:34,758
Nobody gives a toss about Charlton Heston,
the man's a cunt.

351
00:46:37,288 --> 00:46:39,487
You're more the Charles Bronson type.

352
00:46:40,495 --> 00:46:42,495
Charles Bronson...

358
00:48:27,489 --> 00:48:30,975

359
00:48:45,030 --> 00:48:47,455

What Charlie?

370
00:49:39,174 --> 00:49:41,739
You shouldn't mess around with boys
who are bigger than you.

371
00:49:45,242 --> 00:49:47,024
Oh really?

You're having a fuckin laugh ain't ya?

377
00:50:59,617 --> 00:51:03,787
Oh spare me the Oliver Twist routine.
Charlie, love, you need to build your audience.

378
00:51:04,082 --> 00:51:07,260
- I give you fucking magic in there!
- Magic?

379
00:51:07,517 --> 00:51:10,290
You just pissed on a gypsy
in the middle of fucking nowhere.

380
00:51:10,281 --> 00:51:12,758
It's hardly the hottest ticket in town darling.

381
00:51:14,609 --> 00:51:15,938
Where is the next one?

382
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:26,203

383
00:53:27,791 --> 00:53:29,503
Let's fucking go!

385
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:48,973
I love you.

386
00:53:55,137 --> 00:53:56,058

387
00:54:04,072 --> 00:54:04,915
I love you...

388
00:54:14,798 --> 00:54:17,449
It's been nice...

389
00:54:21,978 --> 00:54:23,246
But I love Brian...

390
00:54:28,679 --> 00:54:30,062
Who's Brian?

391
00:54:33,114 --> 00:54:34,434
He's my boyfriend.

392
00:54:39,885 --> 00:54:41,502
And he's got a motorbike.

393
00:54:47,630 --> 00:54:48,994
Brian.

394
00:54:55,088 --> 00:54:56,887
Yes sir, can I help you?

395
00:55:01,007 --> 00:55:03,390
I want to take a butcher's at that ring there.

396
00:55:03,964 --> 00:55:06,771
That ring there, sir,
that's a thousand pound ring, sir.

397
00:55:07,432 --> 00:55:07,901
Fine...

398
00:55:09,284 --> 00:55:10,161
Fuck off!

399
00:55:11,762 --> 00:55:13,681
Don't fucking move!

400
00:55:16,317 --> 00:55:17,404
Or I'll kill ya.

401
00:55:17,864 --> 00:55:18,420
Aight...

402
00:55:20,220 --> 00:55:21,941
Don't fucking move!

403
00:55:22,906 --> 00:55:26,635
And don't call the police
for 10 minutes.

404
00:55:26,735 --> 00:55:27,640
I won't...

405
00:55:27,840 --> 00:55:28,900
Aight.

406
00:55:34,205 --> 00:55:35,570
15 minutes...

407
00:55:36,804 --> 00:55:38,222
Merry Christmas.

408
00:56:00,344 --> 00:56:02,300
I've been thinking...

409
00:56:03,247 --> 00:56:05,368
You're a very sweet man, Charlie...

410
00:56:05,855 --> 00:56:07,158
'bout, about you...

411
00:56:09,288 --> 00:56:13,339
Yeah, but you've got no ambition.
You know what I mean?

412
00:56:17,363 --> 00:56:18,241
Oi this.

413
00:56:35,659 --> 00:56:36,563
Thank you.

414
00:56:44,665 --> 00:56:46,804
Brian and me are getting married...

415
00:56:57,468 --> 00:56:58,571
Right...

416
00:57:01,438 --> 00:57:03,055
Well... hmm

417
00:57:04,976 --> 00:57:06,854
Congratulations!

418
00:57:07,844 --> 00:57:08,705
Eh?

419
00:57:13,668 --> 00:57:15,355
See you later Charlie.

420
00:57:37,253 --> 00:57:38,904
Fucking charming...

421
00:57:39,653 --> 00:57:40,973
Onwards and outwards!

422
00:57:41,990 --> 00:57:43,660
That's what I always say...

423
00:57:45,051 --> 00:57:47,146
??????Hitting is that there
for a reason, didn't it?

424
00:57:53,916 --> 00:57:54,854
<i> Yay... </ i></i>

425
00:57:56,716 --> 00:57:57,654
<i> Magic... </ i></i>

426
00:58:03,183 --> 00:58:10,551
<i> The way it turns out that lovely lady in the jewelery
shop waited exactly 15 minutes.</i>

427
00:58:11,197 --> 00:58:15,248
<i> But it didn't take 'em 15 minutes
to find me. </ i></i>

428
00:58:16,961 --> 00:58:19,864
<i> We'd been expecting them. </ i></i>

429
00:58:58,875 --> 00:59:00,518
Well, well, well...

430
00:59:02,057 --> 00:59:05,074
Charles Bronson... is it now?

431
00:59:06,290 --> 00:59:10,089
<i> An American Mongolian pop star. </i>

432
00:59:10,307 --> 00:59:11,480
<i> Film star sir. </i>

433
00:59:11,949 --> 00:59:14,400
"Death Wish"
Bloody good as it happens.

434
00:59:14,651 --> 00:59:16,946
Yeah I'm sure of it,
sure, thank you.

435
00:59:18,602 --> 00:59:19,653
So...

436
00:59:21,302 --> 00:59:23,453
69 days, was it?

437
00:59:25,344 --> 00:59:28,395
69 days all to yourself.

438
00:59:29,282 --> 00:59:31,733
Another of your prison record's broken.

439
00:59:34,419 --> 00:59:36,819
So tell me Charles Bronson...

440
00:59:37,600 --> 00:59:41,607
What exactly did you do
with yourself for these 69 days?

441
00:59:43,711 --> 00:59:45,992
I was building an empire.

442
00:59:51,724 --> 00:59:53,614
You're ridiculous.

443
01:00:20,313 --> 01:00:22,539
Come on Charlie.
Something to read?

444
01:00:23,321 --> 01:00:26,006
I got another Judy Cooper.

445
01:00:26,980 --> 01:00:30,031
????????
This one's really good.

446
01:00:31,638 --> 01:00:33,273
Shut your fucking mouth!

447
01:00:33,300 --> 01:00:33,655
No problem Charlie.

448
01:00:33,699 --> 01:00:35,941
Shut the fuck up you cunt!

449
01:00:38,499 --> 01:00:39,541
Shut it!

450
01:00:50,796 --> 01:00:51,508
Watch!

451
01:00:53,334 --> 01:00:56,559
I got a librarian up here!

452
01:00:58,227 --> 01:01:01,069
And he's in a lot of trouble!

453
01:01:02,712 --> 01:01:06,563
So I think you should send someone up to help him out.
Don't you?!

454
01:01:06,712 --> 01:01:07,863
<i> Fuck's sake,
not again! </i>

455
01:01:09,812 --> 01:01:12,000
<i> Dr. Hotchkins!
Get the doctor! </i>

456
01:01:12,312 --> 01:01:13,000
Alright...

457
01:01:16,220 --> 01:01:17,167
Sit down.

458
01:01:18,957 --> 01:01:21,974
Not there!
In the fucking karsy you cunt!

459
01:01:46,573 --> 01:01:47,573
What happens now?

460
01:01:49,781 --> 01:01:53,049
Ah... hmmm...
I don't know.

461
01:01:58,238 --> 01:02:01,976
Well we just have to...
we'll have to wait.

462
01:02:04,915 --> 01:02:07,340

01:02:10,695 --> 01:02:11,555
I'll wait...
(mumbling)

466
01:02:46,230 --> 01:02:46,622
Hello?

467
01:02:47,908 --> 01:02:49,473
Hello Charlie.

468
01:02:50,264 --> 01:02:51,177
Can you hear me?

469
01:02:51,369 --> 01:02:55,902
<i> Of course I can fucking hear you 
there's nothing wrong with my hearing you cunt.</i>

470
01:02:57,044 --> 01:02:58,435
<i> What is it, Charlie? </ i></i>

471
01:02:58,713 --> 01:03:00,730
"What is it, Charlie!?"

472
01:03:02,520 --> 01:03:03,077
Well...

473
01:03:04,894 --> 01:03:07,015

01:03:18,439 --> 01:03:20,502
<i> Right...

478
01:03:21,339 --> 01:03:23,000
<i> with Andy Love </i>

479
01:03:23,661 --> 01:03:27,008

480
01:03:27,016 --> 01:03:30,015
if I don't get what I want!

481
01:03:31,284 --> 01:03:32,632
What do you want?

482
01:03:35,021 --> 01:03:36,351
What do I want?

483
01:03:41,072 --> 01:03:42,993
What have you got?

484
01:03:43,566 --> 01:03:43,957
Well...

485
01:03:45,730 --> 01:03:47,894
that's entirely up to you...

486
01:03:49,599 --> 01:03:50,737

01:04:07,374 --> 01:04:09,199
Are you a family man?

01:04:15,930 --> 01:04:18,352
- Wha-Wha-What are you doing?
- What am I doing?

494
01:04:19,647 --> 01:04:22,125
What the fuck does it look

495
01:04:22,133 --> 01:04:25,514
- Loo-look, le-le-let's talk.

496
01:04:25,639 --> 01:04:28,035
Fucking pointless.

01:04:28,679 --> 01:04:31,185
- Wait.

498
01:04:31,379 --> 01:04:32,785

01:04:35,207 --> 01:04:37,493
What am I gonna do?

501
01:04:37,885 --> 01:04:42,014
I'm gonna put my fucking body paint on
that's what I'm gonna do.

502
01:04:42,878 --> 01:04:44,150
Put my butter all over my...

503
01:04:44,178 --> 01:04:45,186

504
01:04:46,098 --> 01:04:47,445

505
01:04:47,898 --> 01:04:49,000

506
01:04:50,365 --> 01:04:53,364
Go on get some of that rubbed

507
01:04:53,365 --> 01:04:53,640
Huh?

01:04:53,642 --> 01:04:56,750
Get over the motherfucking bed now

509
01:04:57,140 --> 01:05:00,813
Go on rub it in.
That's right we ain't got all day.

510
01:05:00,950 --> 01:05:04,450
Rub it right down my back.
Go on, down my back and my legs!

511
01:05:04,500 --> 01:05:07,000
Back o' my legs, my ass,

01:05:07,030 --> 01:05:07,821
On my ass.

513

Not in my ass you fucking homo!
Dammit!

Come on and fuck off you cunts!

520
01:06:08,459 --> 01:06:10,616
Alright... Charlie Bronson...

521
01:06:12,814 --> 01:06:14,301
I'll get straight to the point.

522
01:06:14,979 --> 01:06:19,357
We have been standing rather close to the window
of late and I detect a rocky patch.

523
01:06:21,734 --> 01:06:25,045
I had hoped that you coming on to
the special unit with us

524
01:06:25,324 --> 01:06:29,480
might make you want to
stop this hostage taking business.

525
01:06:30,360 --> 01:06:31,933
This attacking of my officers...

526
01:06:31,976 --> 01:06:33,567
We can handle this prick sir.

527
01:06:33,593 --> 01:06:36,479
Webber would you please take
the rest of the afternoon off.
Thank you.

528
01:06:36,992 --> 01:06:39,965
Be in my office at 6:15 sharp tomorrow morning.
Thank you, goodbye.

529
01:06:40,208 --> 01:06:41,060
Yes, sir.

530
01:06:47,561 --> 01:06:52,429
Look, I'm not in the habit
of making deals with prisoners.

531
01:06:53,142 --> 01:06:57,349
For your recent escapade you will be punished.
Again... block.

532
01:07:00,809 --> 01:07:04,824
If you have absolutely no interest
whatsoever in yourself

533
01:07:05,111 --> 01:07:09,152
then you leave us at a bit of a loss
with regards of what to do with you.

534
01:07:14,681 --> 01:07:18,393
What would you like us to do?
Charlie Bronson.

535
01:07:22,582 --> 01:07:23,967
Fuck off!

536
01:07:30,004 --> 01:07:31,325
You're pitiful...

537
01:07:32,690 --> 01:07:33,577
You know that...

538
01:07:35,610 --> 01:07:36,976
and I can promise you this.

539
01:07:37,975 --> 01:07:44,121
If you further this mindless behavior,
if you continue to act in this nihilistic
and godless fashion

540
01:07:44,155 --> 01:07:46,728
you will die inside.

541
01:08:33,406 --> 01:08:35,954
Uno, dos, tres...

542
01:08:46,419 --> 01:08:48,354
Cuatro...
Oops, sorry.

543
01:08:50,235 --> 01:08:53,417
Cómo está?
What's this?

544
01:08:54,565 --> 01:08:56,677
<i>- A paint.
- Good for you.</i>

545
01:08:59,138 --> 01:09:02,916
<i> Sun, sea, sand.
Make it work. Perfect. </i>

546
01:09:04,153 --> 01:09:05,961
<i> Who's is this? </i>

547
01:09:06,917 --> 01:09:08,133
<i> Hey! Who's is this? </i>

548
01:09:10,420 --> 01:09:13,854
<i> Come on now, who did the crime? </i>

549
01:09:15,400 --> 01:09:16,100
<i> Bombs away... </i>

550
01:09:17,800 --> 01:09:20,200
<i> Not your art teacher for most of you, no? </i>

551
01:09:32,663 --> 01:09:35,233
Very interesting, Charlie.

552
01:09:41,494 --> 01:09:42,651
Interesting?

553
01:09:44,216 --> 01:09:46,545
Yeah, it's interesting.

554
01:09:50,387 --> 01:09:52,786
<i>- And what does that mean?
- What does "interesting" mean?</i>

555
01:09:53,273 --> 01:09:54,724
<i> Interesting's good. </i>

556
01:09:55,100 --> 01:09:56,800
<i> Bravado! </i>

557
01:09:57,688 --> 01:09:58,262
You know?

558
01:09:59,652 --> 01:10:03,478
Yeah you can't pin it down.
Can't compute.

559
01:10:05,154 --> 01:10:07,683
You can't tie that up in a nice lil'
pink bow.

560
01:10:08,057 --> 01:10:09,908
Nah, you can't pin me down mate.

561
01:10:11,557 --> 01:10:13,000
Pájaros!

562
01:10:13,050 --> 01:10:16,932
- You're fucking me?!
- Birds, birds, Charlie, I'm learning Spanish.
Español.

563
01:10:18,523 --> 01:10:19,322
Olé...

564
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:21,700
Olé...

565
01:10:26,486 --> 01:10:28,709
Lot of birds in your work Charlie.

566
01:10:28,834 --> 01:10:31,344
Well I don't really get to see, maestro,
a bit off...

567
01:10:32,118 --> 01:10:35,151
birds and... pa-ja-ros...

568
01:10:35,785 --> 01:10:37,063
Pajaros.

569
01:10:38,480 --> 01:10:39,788
Pajaros.

570
01:10:40,792 --> 01:10:41,705
I know mate.

571
01:10:43,287 --> 01:10:44,887
Here's an idea for ya.

572
01:10:46,173 --> 01:10:50,997
Find that piece of you Charles.
That piece, that doesn't belong here.

573
01:10:52,188 --> 01:10:53,761
Fucking hell!

574
01:12:12,573 --> 01:12:15,782
Prisoner plating 1314, Bronson, sir!

575
01:12:16,468 --> 01:12:17,607
Well then Bronson...

576
01:12:18,200 --> 01:12:19,000
Well...

577
01:12:21,840 --> 01:12:24,013
Mr. Danielson here tells me that

578
01:12:24,596 --> 01:12:28,672
you've been doing extraordinarily well
in your creative endeavors.

579
01:12:29,436 --> 01:12:34,268
- Champions of butting Magritte.
- That's right yeah.

580
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:39,646
Now...
You know we've been holding these
artist materials for you.

581
01:12:40,198 --> 01:12:42,406
Sent in by your cousin, Lauraine?

582
01:12:43,632 --> 01:12:48,203
Well now that we are rather sadly
having to consider the future
of the arts facility.

583
01:12:48,647 --> 01:12:52,412
I didn't see any reason why you
shouldn't be allowed these materials now.

584
01:12:53,167 --> 01:12:55,035
Should help you tremendously with your work.

585
01:12:56,966 --> 01:13:01,198
Mr. Danielson really has got
great confidence in your cooperation.

586
01:13:01,737 --> 01:13:05,901
Your responsibility,
your ability to interact within group.

587
01:13:07,154 --> 01:13:11,727
I strongly advise that you continue
to follow this path.

588
01:13:12,413 --> 01:13:16,315
And I look forward to seeing some of this
wonderful work I've heard so much about.

589
01:13:17,463 --> 01:13:22,400
Gov-Governor... Cha-Charlie's actually brought
something for you to have a look at now...
If you'd, if you'd like to... Charlie...

590
01:13:27,460 --> 01:13:28,269
That's for you.

591
01:13:30,346 --> 01:13:30,946
Thank you.

592
01:13:33,457 --> 01:13:36,395
If you give it to Webber,
I'd be able to have it a 'lil bit later.

593
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:38,000
Thank you.

594
01:13:38,533 --> 01:13:42,740
Right then Bronson!
What are you waiting for son?!
Let's go! Move it! Move it!

595
01:13:45,123 --> 01:13:47,074
I said let's go!
Move it!

596
01:13:54,133 --> 01:13:58,080
Oops, sorry Webber, that's for you mate.

597
01:14:06,392 --> 01:14:09,204
He's a star fucker that one...

598
01:14:09,190 --> 01:14:11,119
I'll make sure he looks at that painting mate

599
01:14:11,106 --> 01:14:12,772
don't you worry about that.

600
01:14:13,106 --> 01:14:14,372
Review the unit!

601
01:14:16,213 --> 01:14:19,146
Honest to God though Charlie
and I'll tell you this straight

602
01:14:19,404 --> 01:14:22,100
I wouldn't be surprised if they started
to discuss your release date.

603
01:14:22,274 --> 01:14:26,602
I mean, look...
It's just my opinion, it's not necessarily
the opinion of others but...

604
01:14:27,185 --> 01:14:33,392
you know, if there's one thing I am,
I am a very good judge of character.

605
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:35,000
Yup.

606
01:14:35,100 --> 01:14:39,000
Si... si..
Si si si.

607
01:14:39,490 --> 01:14:42,288
You'll get a call mate.
You will...

608
01:14:42,546 --> 01:14:43,932
You know why?

609
01:14:44,651 --> 01:14:48,319
You're a brilliant artist.
Bueno.

610
01:14:48,320 --> 01:14:49,719
Buenísimo.

611
01:14:49,908 --> 01:14:50,859
I'm so excited mate.

612
01:14:50,984 --> 01:14:52,326
I'm proud as punch.

613
01:14:52,451 --> 01:14:54,513
'Cause you're a fucking star!

614
01:14:54,961 --> 01:14:56,000
Gov's a cunt.

615
01:14:56,100 --> 01:14:59,000
He is.
Fuck him!
Can't stand the wanker.

616
01:15:00,205 --> 01:15:01,400
Just keep your head down.

617
01:15:01,525 --> 01:15:04,674
And I'm absolutely positivo
that we can do this.

618
01:15:05,801 --> 01:15:07,635
We can mate.

619
01:15:09,605 --> 01:15:11,302
What you mean we?

620
01:15:13,516 --> 01:15:17,349
Wait no... I'm just saying
I'm just saying... no no no no no,
Charlie, Charles

621
01:15:17,427 --> 01:15:19,274
Don't misunderstand me mate.

622
01:15:20,320 --> 01:15:21,311
What I'm saying is

623
01:15:21,597 --> 01:15:22,873
You...

624
01:15:24,109 --> 01:15:24,843
You...

625
01:15:25,372 --> 01:15:28,822
are finally going to get
what you always wanted.

626
01:15:34,309 --> 01:15:37,806
What you know about what I fucking want?

627
01:16:09,727 --> 01:16:11,349
What happened to my tea Phil?

628
01:16:12,745 --> 01:16:16,507
Sorry mate,
I'm such a cunt I completely forgot.

629
01:16:18,530 --> 01:16:20,270
Two for you.

630
01:16:21,641 --> 01:16:23,264
Two for me.

631
01:16:25,429 --> 01:16:27,344
And then we have a cup of tea.

632
01:17:57,000 --> 01:17:58,344
<i> Charlie </i>

633
01:18:01,221 --> 01:18:03,000
<i> What is it you want now? </ i></i>

634
01:18:11,327 --> 01:18:12,495
Music

635
01:18:18,227 --> 01:18:20,550
I don't see how's that gonna help
the situation.

636
01:18:20,903 --> 01:18:23,415
I'll fucking kill him!

637
01:18:26,133 --> 01:18:28,265
I swear it!

638
01:18:31,849 --> 01:18:32,800
Bennett.

639
01:18:35,843 --> 01:18:39,347
- Give me some music on now, please.
- Yes Gov!

640
01:20:14,325 --> 01:20:15,888
Hey Charlie...

641
01:20:17,761 --> 01:20:20,264
Not feeling very well now, mate?

642
01:23:15,996 --> 01:23:16,969
Oh yeah...

643
01:23:19,037 --> 01:23:21,004
that's a fucking piece of me!

644
01:23:40,760 --> 01:23:44,219
Right that's enough!
He's had enough!
Get him out of here!

645
01:23:45,331 --> 01:23:47,964
Go on and get him the fuck out of here!
He's had enough!

646
01:23:47,965 --> 01:23:49,100
Come on!

647
01:23:49,225 --> 01:23:51,094
You fucking cunts!

648
01:23:51,867 --> 01:23:53,520
No class tomorrow eh Phil?

649
