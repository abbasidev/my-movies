1
00:02:12,378 --> 00:02:13,378
Dr. Cotter.

2
00:02:13,445 --> 00:02:15,080
He's gonna die.
She's gonna die.

3
00:02:15,214 --> 00:02:17,082
Mom's gonna die. I'm
gonna die. Everybody dies.

4
00:02:17,216 --> 00:02:19,751
I don't wanna... I'm gonna...

5
00:02:20,852 --> 00:02:22,820
I haven't been able
to get him to talk...

6
00:02:22,954 --> 00:02:24,356
respond to me, nothing.

7
00:02:26,158 --> 00:02:27,393
Just this.

8
00:02:27,526 --> 00:02:29,761
Yeah. I got it.

9
00:02:30,529 --> 00:02:31,664
Thanks, Dan.

10
00:02:31,796 --> 00:02:33,076
She's gonna die.
Mom's gonna die.

11
00:02:33,165 --> 00:02:34,633
I'm gonna die. Everyone dies.

12
00:02:34,766 --> 00:02:36,502
Nobody matters.
She doesn't matter.

13
00:02:36,635 --> 00:02:38,812
He doesn't matter. She doesn't
matter. Mom doesn't matter.

14
00:02:38,836 --> 00:02:40,406
I don't matter.
Nothing ever matters.

15
00:02:40,539 --> 00:02:43,275
I don't matter. I don't
matter. I don't matter.

16
00:02:43,409 --> 00:02:45,009
He's gonna die.
She's gonna die.

17
00:02:45,144 --> 00:02:47,213
He's gonna die. I'm
gonna die. Everyone dies.

18
00:02:47,346 --> 00:02:49,114
Nobody matters.
She doesn't matter.

19
00:02:49,248 --> 00:02:51,193
He doesn't matter. She
doesn't matter. Everyone dies.

20
00:02:51,217 --> 00:02:52,484
I'm gonna die. Nobody matters.

21
00:02:52,618 --> 00:02:54,687
She doesn't matter.
He doesn't matter.

22
00:02:54,819 --> 00:02:56,331
Mom doesn't matter.
Nothing ever matters.

23
00:02:56,355 --> 00:02:58,090
I don't matter. I don't ma...

24
00:02:58,224 --> 00:03:00,626
I'm gonna... I'm gonna...
I'm gonna... I'm gonna...

25
00:03:00,758 --> 00:03:03,861
She's gonna... She's gonna...
Everyone... I'm gonna...

26
00:03:03,995 --> 00:03:06,232
I don't matter. I'm
gonna... I'm gonna...

27
00:03:12,271 --> 00:03:13,405
Hi, Carl.

28
00:03:15,541 --> 00:03:17,142
What's going on today?

29
00:03:19,278 --> 00:03:20,579
I'm dying.

30
00:03:20,713 --> 00:03:21,980
No.

31
00:03:22,947 --> 00:03:24,416
I don't think so.

32
00:03:27,253 --> 00:03:29,355
I think you're having
another manic episode.

33
00:03:29,488 --> 00:03:30,556
Don't...

34
00:03:31,123 --> 00:03:32,757
Don't you tell me.

35
00:03:33,359 --> 00:03:34,859
You don't know.

36
00:03:34,993 --> 00:03:38,796
I feel it all around
me, squeezing.

37
00:03:43,569 --> 00:03:45,104
I'm scared.

38
00:03:45,237 --> 00:03:50,808
Carl, I know that what you're
experiencing feels real,

39
00:03:50,942 --> 00:03:53,212
but it can't hurt you.

40
00:03:57,650 --> 00:03:58,850
I promise.

41
00:03:58,983 --> 00:04:01,053
He's gonna die.
She's gonna die.

42
00:04:01,186 --> 00:04:03,021
Mom's gonna die.
I'm gonna die.

43
00:04:03,155 --> 00:04:05,424
Everyone dies. Nobody matters.

44
00:04:05,557 --> 00:04:09,561
Hey, Wanda. I'm gonna put Carl Renken
into observation for a few days.

45
00:04:09,695 --> 00:04:11,764
He's harmless. Just make
sure someone checks on him

46
00:04:11,896 --> 00:04:12,897
every couple hours.

47
00:04:13,031 --> 00:04:14,600
You got it. Thanks.

48
00:04:14,733 --> 00:04:17,102
Hey, Dr. Desai was
looking for you.

49
00:04:18,002 --> 00:04:18,803
Thank you.

50
00:04:30,948 --> 00:04:33,118
No! No! Please!

51
00:04:33,252 --> 00:04:36,155
Please! You don't understand!
I can't go in there! No!

52
00:04:36,288 --> 00:04:39,957
No! No! Please!

53
00:04:40,426 --> 00:04:41,859
No!

54
00:04:42,628 --> 00:04:44,196
No!

55
00:05:00,945 --> 00:05:02,247
Come in.

56
00:05:03,515 --> 00:05:07,119
Hey, did you send a
patient named, uh,

57
00:05:07,252 --> 00:05:09,854
Sarah Marquet over to
residency yesterday?

58
00:05:09,987 --> 00:05:12,658
Yes. She has a history
with drug abuse and mania,

59
00:05:12,791 --> 00:05:15,594
and she's been in and out of
our unit a few times.

60
00:05:15,728 --> 00:05:17,096
Rose, she has no insurance.

61
00:05:17,229 --> 00:05:18,597
Okay, but she needs treatment.

62
00:05:18,731 --> 00:05:20,932
The board is down my throat
about paying out of pocket

63
00:05:21,066 --> 00:05:22,735
for another bed in
the residency program.

64
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:24,470
Maybe the board should
try giving a shit

65
00:05:24,603 --> 00:05:27,439
about the point of our
job here once in a while.

66
00:05:29,441 --> 00:05:30,908
I'm not questioning
your judgment.

67
00:05:31,042 --> 00:05:32,402
I just need you to
come to me first

68
00:05:32,444 --> 00:05:34,244
so I can get ahead of
it next time. All right?

69
00:05:34,313 --> 00:05:35,514
Yes.

70
00:05:35,647 --> 00:05:37,416
Okay. I'm sorry.

71
00:05:37,549 --> 00:05:40,652
Hey, you haven't been here since
the late shift last night, have you?

72
00:06:15,854 --> 00:06:17,055
Dr. Cotter.

73
00:06:17,189 --> 00:06:19,158
Laura Weaver, 26.
She's a grad student.

74
00:06:19,291 --> 00:06:21,293
Police were called on her
for public disturbance.

75
00:06:21,427 --> 00:06:23,328
EMS brought her in.
Got any psych history?

76
00:06:23,462 --> 00:06:25,422
Nothing on file, but the
police sent over a report

77
00:06:25,497 --> 00:06:27,866
for a different incident she
was involved in last week.

78
00:06:27,999 --> 00:06:29,668
And what was that one about?

79
00:06:29,802 --> 00:06:32,970
A professor at her school bludgeoned
himself to death with a hammer.

80
00:06:33,105 --> 00:06:35,374
She was interviewed
as the only witness.

81
00:06:35,507 --> 00:06:36,974
A hammer?

82
00:06:46,852 --> 00:06:48,187
Hi.

83
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:49,755
Laura?

84
00:06:53,158 --> 00:06:56,562
My name is Dr. Cotter.
I'm a therapist.

85
00:06:56,695 --> 00:06:58,197
Do you wanna sit down?

86
00:07:00,732 --> 00:07:02,501
Okay.

87
00:07:04,436 --> 00:07:06,138
I know you're nervous.

88
00:07:06,538 --> 00:07:07,972
That's okay.

89
00:07:08,941 --> 00:07:10,776
I just wanna have a chat.

90
00:07:10,909 --> 00:07:13,245
I promise this is a safe place.

91
00:07:14,213 --> 00:07:15,681
Not for me.

92
00:07:17,216 --> 00:07:18,784
Why do you say that?

93
00:07:24,423 --> 00:07:26,658
Come on. Let's sit.

94
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:36,068
Please.

95
00:07:52,384 --> 00:07:57,256
Okay. I'm gonna have to ask you a couple
of questions that might sound stupid.

96
00:08:00,359 --> 00:08:02,594
What day of the week is it?

97
00:08:03,529 --> 00:08:04,563
Thursday.

98
00:08:05,597 --> 00:08:06,665
And the month?

99
00:08:06,798 --> 00:08:08,200
October. I'm not crazy.

100
00:08:08,333 --> 00:08:10,769
Nobody's saying that. But
I need you to understand.

101
00:08:10,903 --> 00:08:13,972
I'm a PhD candidate. I'm
not some lunatic. Okay?

102
00:08:14,106 --> 00:08:16,108
Let's just take a breath,

103
00:08:16,241 --> 00:08:19,244
and you can just tell
me what's going on.

104
00:08:29,288 --> 00:08:31,223
I'm seeing something.

105
00:08:32,724 --> 00:08:35,761
Something no one else can see
except for me.

106
00:08:37,996 --> 00:08:39,865
I know how insane
that sounds. I do.

107
00:08:39,998 --> 00:08:43,702
But it's... This thing,
I can't explain it.

108
00:08:45,137 --> 00:08:46,705
What is it you're seeing?

109
00:08:47,706 --> 00:08:49,441
It looks like people,

110
00:08:49,575 --> 00:08:51,510
but it's... it's not a person.

111
00:08:52,844 --> 00:08:54,346
I'm not sure I understand.

112
00:08:54,479 --> 00:08:56,648
It looks like people. It
looks like different people.

113
00:08:56,782 --> 00:08:59,418
Sometimes it pretends to
be someone that I know.

114
00:08:59,551 --> 00:09:02,220
Sometimes it's a random
stranger. Sometimes...

115
00:09:02,354 --> 00:09:04,756
Sometimes it looks
like my grandfather

116
00:09:04,890 --> 00:09:07,593
who died in front of
me when I was seven.

117
00:09:10,162 --> 00:09:12,531
But it's all the
same thing. It...

118
00:09:14,433 --> 00:09:16,802
It's... It's like...

119
00:09:18,470 --> 00:09:22,541
It's... It's like it wears
people's faces like... like masks.

120
00:09:23,809 --> 00:09:25,143
Okay.

121
00:09:25,277 --> 00:09:27,546
Do you see it right now, here?

122
00:09:31,216 --> 00:09:33,518
What happens when you do see it?

123
00:09:37,122 --> 00:09:38,857
It's smiling at me.

124
00:09:40,225 --> 00:09:41,627
But not a friendly smile.

125
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:43,600
It's the worst smile I've
ever seen in my life.

126
00:09:43,662 --> 00:09:45,831
And whenever I see
it, I just get this

127
00:09:45,964 --> 00:09:50,602
god-awful feeling like something
really terrible is gonna happen.

128
00:09:51,503 --> 00:09:54,539
I've never felt scared
like I do when I see it.

129
00:09:55,941 --> 00:09:58,610
Laura, have you or anyone
else in your family

130
00:09:58,744 --> 00:10:00,946
ever experienced hallucinations?

131
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:03,116
It's not a hallucination,
no. It's real.

132
00:10:03,248 --> 00:10:05,183
You don't get it. It
does things to me.

133
00:10:05,317 --> 00:10:07,285
It causes shit to
happen around me.

134
00:10:07,419 --> 00:10:11,323
It's taken over my whole
life and my mind and...

135
00:10:12,824 --> 00:10:14,127
it tells me things.

136
00:10:15,027 --> 00:10:18,563
It told me that to...
today... Today's the...

137
00:10:18,697 --> 00:10:22,167
Today's the day that
I'm... I'm gonna...

138
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:23,902
Okay. That's okay.

139
00:10:24,036 --> 00:10:25,337
That's okay.

140
00:10:26,872 --> 00:10:31,810
I know that what you're
experiencing feels incredibly real.

141
00:10:31,943 --> 00:10:34,780
Sometimes, when we get
emotionally overwhelmed,

142
00:10:34,913 --> 00:10:38,517
or experience an intense
trauma, our minds tend to...

143
00:10:38,650 --> 00:10:40,385
You're not listening to me.

144
00:10:40,852 --> 00:10:42,020
Oh, my God.

145
00:10:43,021 --> 00:10:46,391
I'm gonna fucking die, and
no one will listen to me.

146
00:10:46,525 --> 00:10:48,260
Okay. Laura, it's okay.

147
00:10:48,827 --> 00:10:50,629
Oh, God.

148
00:10:51,164 --> 00:10:53,132
Hey, it's okay. Laura.

149
00:10:53,265 --> 00:10:55,534
Hey, c-can you
look at me, please?

150
00:10:56,935 --> 00:10:57,969
It's okay.

151
00:10:59,138 --> 00:11:00,305
Look at me.

152
00:11:02,541 --> 00:11:03,575
I...

153
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:09,014
Oh, my God. No!

154
00:11:09,148 --> 00:11:10,315
No! It's here!

155
00:11:10,449 --> 00:11:11,650
Please! Laura. It's okay.

156
00:11:11,783 --> 00:11:13,018
It's just us.
Get away! Please!

157
00:11:13,152 --> 00:11:14,312
There's nobody else here. No!

158
00:11:17,123 --> 00:11:18,623
No!

159
00:11:25,164 --> 00:11:26,598
Oh, my God.

160
00:11:28,934 --> 00:11:31,137
I... I have a patient
emergency in eval 2.

161
00:11:31,303 --> 00:11:33,072
I need staff here now.

162
00:11:33,206 --> 00:11:34,206
Hurry.

163
00:11:55,228 --> 00:11:56,495
Laura?

164
00:14:12,697 --> 00:14:14,675
Had Ms. Weaver ever
been a patient here before?

165
00:14:14,699 --> 00:14:18,904
No. Would you say she was
typical of the patients you see here?

166
00:14:19,037 --> 00:14:22,308
This is an emergency
psychiatric unit.

167
00:14:23,109 --> 00:14:25,311
Typical is not
really a thing here.

168
00:14:25,443 --> 00:14:27,412
Right. But she was
a head case, yeah?

169
00:14:27,545 --> 00:14:29,848
I'm sorry, a head case?

170
00:14:33,752 --> 00:14:35,654
I think we're just trying
to get your opinion

171
00:14:35,787 --> 00:14:37,923
of her mental state.

172
00:14:39,125 --> 00:14:41,726
She could've been suffering from

173
00:14:42,527 --> 00:14:44,729
acute post-trauma psychosis.

174
00:14:46,865 --> 00:14:49,567
She was
having paranoid delusions.

175
00:14:49,701 --> 00:14:51,469
What kind of delusions?

176
00:14:51,603 --> 00:14:53,838
She was convinced that some

177
00:14:54,906 --> 00:14:57,809
sort of evil presence
was haunting her.

178
00:14:58,576 --> 00:14:59,911
Yikes.

179
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:04,383
It's just, we're gonna have
to contact Ms. Weaver's family

180
00:15:04,516 --> 00:15:06,252
and attempt to
explain what happened.

181
00:15:06,385 --> 00:15:10,222
So we're looking for anything that
might make some sense of all this.

182
00:15:10,356 --> 00:15:14,693
If there's anything else you can
tell us that... that might help.

183
00:15:23,501 --> 00:15:27,872
Uh, before she died...

184
00:15:29,774 --> 00:15:33,346
she was... smiling.

185
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:37,015
Yeah, she sounds
fucking crazy to me.

186
00:18:17,076 --> 00:18:18,410
Rose.

187
00:18:20,079 --> 00:18:21,080
Whoa.

188
00:18:22,881 --> 00:18:25,151
My bad. Did I scare you?

189
00:18:25,284 --> 00:18:27,253
I didn't hear you
come in. Shit.

190
00:18:27,819 --> 00:18:29,088
Hi. Hi.

191
00:18:29,221 --> 00:18:30,256
Hi.

192
00:18:31,890 --> 00:18:33,192
What's up?

193
00:18:33,725 --> 00:18:35,693
Nothing. Sorry.

194
00:18:36,895 --> 00:18:38,264
Something's wrong.

195
00:18:41,666 --> 00:18:43,402
A patient died today.

196
00:18:43,536 --> 00:18:45,104
My patient.

197
00:18:45,237 --> 00:18:46,505
Oh.

198
00:18:46,639 --> 00:18:48,240
Hey, come here.

199
00:18:49,275 --> 00:18:50,675
I'm sorry.

200
00:18:51,776 --> 00:18:53,912
It happened right
in front of me.

201
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:55,880
It was awful.

202
00:18:57,048 --> 00:18:58,983
I'm so sorry. What can I do?

203
00:19:02,754 --> 00:19:04,423
This is a nice start.

204
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:13,165
Maybe we should bail
on dinner tonight.

205
00:19:16,034 --> 00:19:18,137
We can't.

206
00:19:18,903 --> 00:19:21,373
Holly hired a sitter,

207
00:19:21,507 --> 00:19:24,343
and it's just gonna be a
bigger headache if we don't go.

208
00:19:24,476 --> 00:19:26,711
No way. Holly turning
into a headache?

209
00:19:29,415 --> 00:19:30,449
Hey.

210
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:43,971
I'm sorry,
you wanna talk about being tired?

211
00:19:43,995 --> 00:19:45,473
Now that Jackson's
in the first grade,

212
00:19:45,497 --> 00:19:48,167
I'm literally up at
6:00 a.m. every day

213
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:50,469
to make him breakfast
and pack him lunch.

214
00:19:50,603 --> 00:19:54,306
God knows what kind of nonorganic
garbage that cafeteria is even serving.

215
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:56,051
Then I have
to drive him to school,

216
00:19:56,075 --> 00:19:57,842
barely have any time
to run my own errands.

217
00:19:57,976 --> 00:20:01,113
Like, I haven't been to Pilates in
weeks. Okay, my body is so fucked.

218
00:20:01,247 --> 00:20:03,247
Not true. I have to go back
to school, pick him up,

219
00:20:03,282 --> 00:20:07,119
then I have to take him to either soccer
practice, swim lessons, karate, theater...

220
00:20:07,253 --> 00:20:09,154
Oh, and he just
started taking Spanish.

221
00:20:09,288 --> 00:20:12,824
I mean, my weekdays
are literally impossible.

222
00:20:14,759 --> 00:20:17,196
Mmm. You are coming
Saturday, right?

223
00:20:18,297 --> 00:20:19,398
What?

224
00:20:20,099 --> 00:20:22,167
Uh, sorry, what's Saturday?

225
00:20:22,301 --> 00:20:24,136
I'm sorry, is
that a joke? Wow.

226
00:20:24,270 --> 00:20:26,372
Rose, Jackson's seventh
birthday party. Wow.

227
00:20:26,505 --> 00:20:28,507
I've told you, like,
five times.

228
00:20:28,641 --> 00:20:30,109
I can't. I have work.

229
00:20:30,908 --> 00:20:32,711
What do you mean
work? It's Saturday.

230
00:20:32,844 --> 00:20:33,844
I work Saturday.

231
00:20:33,911 --> 00:20:35,281
See, this is exactly why

232
00:20:35,414 --> 00:20:36,957
you have to get out
of that gross hospital

233
00:20:36,981 --> 00:20:38,883
and into a private
practice... Gross?

234
00:20:39,017 --> 00:20:41,053
It is not gross. Working
normal-people hours.

235
00:20:41,186 --> 00:20:43,955
Rose, there have to be
plenty of crazies out there

236
00:20:44,089 --> 00:20:45,823
who will actually pay
you for your time.

237
00:20:45,957 --> 00:20:48,494
Thank you so much
for your input, Greg.

238
00:20:48,627 --> 00:20:49,762
That's very sweet.

239
00:20:49,894 --> 00:20:51,363
I'm just saying,
why become a doctor

240
00:20:51,497 --> 00:20:53,666
if you can't get
disgustingly rich?

241
00:20:53,798 --> 00:20:55,078
You're kidding, right?

242
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,880
Rose loves being a doctor.
She'd do it for free.

243
00:20:58,002 --> 00:21:00,205
What...

244
00:21:01,707 --> 00:21:03,841
Well, on the subject of
wasted earning potentials,

245
00:21:03,975 --> 00:21:06,545
we could always sell the fucking
house. Can we not right now?

246
00:21:06,679 --> 00:21:08,781
I don't understand you.
It's just sitting there.

247
00:21:08,913 --> 00:21:10,683
We grew up in that house.

248
00:21:10,815 --> 00:21:13,686
Rose, it's a total teardown. Why
not just get the money for the land?

249
00:21:13,818 --> 00:21:15,820
Can you guys just
shut the fuck up?

250
00:21:17,189 --> 00:21:18,223
Wow.

251
00:21:19,824 --> 00:21:20,958
Thank you.

252
00:21:21,093 --> 00:21:22,594
Thank you so much. Sure.

253
00:21:24,496 --> 00:21:26,532
I've been looking
forward to this.

254
00:21:59,665 --> 00:22:00,898
You okay?

255
00:22:01,333 --> 00:22:02,368
Yeah.

256
00:22:20,052 --> 00:22:21,420
Morning, Doc.

257
00:22:24,623 --> 00:22:25,957
Morning.

258
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:37,603
Hey. Yesterday, that
patient, Laura Weaver...

259
00:22:37,736 --> 00:22:41,774
The police had sent a report about a
different incident that she was involved in.

260
00:22:41,906 --> 00:22:43,184
Can you get that
forwarded to me?

261
00:22:43,208 --> 00:22:44,576
You got it, Doc.

262
00:22:44,710 --> 00:22:46,944
Also, I was supposed to have
a session with Jane Park.

263
00:22:47,079 --> 00:22:51,083
Oh, yeah. She pulled out a bunch of her
hair overnight and swallowed it all.

264
00:22:51,216 --> 00:22:53,752
They took her down to medicine
to have her stomach pumped.

265
00:22:53,886 --> 00:22:56,221
Shit.

266
00:22:56,822 --> 00:22:58,490
Uh, Rose.

267
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:04,897
What... What are you... I was
on a... I was on a call nearby,

268
00:23:05,029 --> 00:23:06,698
and I just thought I would...

269
00:23:07,566 --> 00:23:08,700
Um...

270
00:23:08,834 --> 00:23:10,754
You know, we didn't really
get to talk yesterday,

271
00:23:10,836 --> 00:23:13,672
other than the
whole... Whole thing.

272
00:23:13,806 --> 00:23:16,909
And I just wanted you to know
that when the call came in,

273
00:23:17,041 --> 00:23:19,311
I had no idea it
was gonna be you.

274
00:23:19,445 --> 00:23:21,079
So, I'm sorry if that was weird.

275
00:23:21,213 --> 00:23:23,282
It's your job. I get it.

276
00:23:24,817 --> 00:23:25,884
How you been?

277
00:23:26,017 --> 00:23:28,220
Joel, why are you here?

278
00:23:29,321 --> 00:23:31,723
You know, like I said, I was
on a call nearby, and I just,

279
00:23:31,857 --> 00:23:33,425
you know, thought I would...

280
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:37,062
come check on you.

281
00:23:37,196 --> 00:23:40,799
After everything that happened yesterday,
that's... that's not an easy thing.

282
00:23:40,933 --> 00:23:44,636
Okay. I appreciate it, but I
don't need you to check on me.

283
00:23:49,074 --> 00:23:50,709
Right.

284
00:23:50,843 --> 00:23:53,645
No, yeah, I mean... Sorry.

285
00:23:55,012 --> 00:23:56,548
I have to get back to work.

286
00:23:56,682 --> 00:23:57,783
Yeah.

287
00:23:57,916 --> 00:23:59,284
See you around.

288
00:24:06,291 --> 00:24:08,093
You do know she's
engaged, right?

289
00:24:10,496 --> 00:24:12,064
Yeah.

290
00:24:13,966 --> 00:24:15,634
I'm single.

291
00:24:51,403 --> 00:24:53,171
Hello. <i>Hi.</i>

292
00:24:53,305 --> 00:24:55,807
<i>Um, look, I just wanted to say
sorry about last night, okay?</i>

293
00:24:55,941 --> 00:24:59,077
<i>I shouldn't have kept
going at you like that.</i>

294
00:24:59,211 --> 00:25:00,746
Uh, no, I...

295
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:02,981
I should apologize.

296
00:25:03,749 --> 00:25:05,984
I've been just dealing
with some stuff.

297
00:25:06,118 --> 00:25:08,520
I wasn't being
very good company.

298
00:25:08,654 --> 00:25:11,290
<i>Okay. If you can't make it to
your nephew's party tomorrow,</i>

299
00:25:11,423 --> 00:25:13,625
<i>you could at least
get him a present.</i>

300
00:25:13,759 --> 00:25:17,062
<i>If you need an idea, he's really
into electric model trains.</i>

301
00:25:17,195 --> 00:25:18,530
Uh-huh.

302
00:25:18,664 --> 00:25:21,033
<i>You sound weird. Are you okay?</i>

303
00:25:21,166 --> 00:25:23,435
Yeah, no, I'm fine.

304
00:25:48,994 --> 00:25:50,462
Hey, Carl.

305
00:25:52,030 --> 00:25:54,132
How you feeling today?

306
00:26:04,710 --> 00:26:05,844
Carl.

307
00:26:11,116 --> 00:26:12,451
Carl?

308
00:26:18,290 --> 00:26:20,659
She's gonna die.
I'm gonna die.

309
00:26:20,792 --> 00:26:22,728
Everybody dies.
Carl, look at me.

310
00:26:22,861 --> 00:26:24,663
You're going to die.

311
00:26:24,796 --> 00:26:26,231
You're going to die.

312
00:26:26,365 --> 00:26:27,833
You're going to die.

313
00:26:27,966 --> 00:26:31,470
You're going to die.
You're going to die.

314
00:26:31,603 --> 00:26:34,873
You're going to die.
You're going to die.

315
00:26:35,007 --> 00:26:36,475
You're going to die. Help!

316
00:26:36,608 --> 00:26:38,710
Help! This patient is 5150!

317
00:26:38,844 --> 00:26:41,146
He needs to be
restrained! Go, go, go!

318
00:26:42,314 --> 00:26:44,049
No! No!

319
00:26:44,182 --> 00:26:45,550
No!

320
00:26:46,018 --> 00:26:49,921
No! No! No! No!

321
00:26:50,056 --> 00:26:52,024
No! No!

322
00:26:52,157 --> 00:26:54,760
No! No!

323
00:26:54,893 --> 00:26:57,329
No!

324
00:27:07,739 --> 00:27:09,441
He was aggressive.

325
00:27:09,941 --> 00:27:11,977
Acting psychotic.

326
00:27:12,111 --> 00:27:14,746
Carl Renken has been in and
out of here a dozen times

327
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:17,983
and has never exhibited behavior
even remotely aggressive.

328
00:27:18,117 --> 00:27:20,385
Do you think I'm making
it up? Of course not.

329
00:27:20,519 --> 00:27:22,721
But yesterday, a
patient in your care

330
00:27:22,854 --> 00:27:25,657
killed herself brutally
in front of you.

331
00:27:26,391 --> 00:27:28,260
Is it possible,
when you presumed

332
00:27:28,393 --> 00:27:30,228
that Carl Renken was
a danger to himself,

333
00:27:30,362 --> 00:27:32,798
that that's what your
mind was reacting to?

334
00:27:35,934 --> 00:27:40,205
I suppose I could've misinterpreted
the situation and overreacted.

335
00:27:42,874 --> 00:27:43,874
Okay.

336
00:27:43,909 --> 00:27:46,712
So, here's what's gonna happen.

337
00:27:47,679 --> 00:27:49,648
You're gonna take
a paid week off.

338
00:27:49,781 --> 00:27:51,516
Morgan, that's
really not necessary.

339
00:27:51,650 --> 00:27:54,886
You've been working
80-hour weeks for months.

340
00:27:55,020 --> 00:27:57,589
I'm concerned that you
haven't been sleeping.

341
00:27:57,723 --> 00:28:01,660
We can't help these patients unless we
have our own mental health in check.

342
00:28:01,793 --> 00:28:03,562
And it's in the
unit's best interest

343
00:28:03,695 --> 00:28:05,731
if you just take a week
and clear your head.

344
00:28:05,864 --> 00:28:09,401
Just do what you gotta do
and come back focused, okay?

345
00:31:22,328 --> 00:31:23,728
Fuck!

346
00:32:33,732 --> 00:32:36,801
Hello?
<i>This is First Line Security.</i>

347
00:32:36,935 --> 00:32:39,271
<i>May I have your name
and the passcode?</i>

348
00:32:39,405 --> 00:32:41,307
Uh, Rose Cotter.

349
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:42,807
Um, "Acapulco."

350
00:32:42,941 --> 00:32:44,609
<i>Ma'am, we've detected
a door alarm.</i>

351
00:32:44,743 --> 00:32:48,513
Yeah, uh, the... the back
door of my house is open.

352
00:32:48,646 --> 00:32:50,682
<i>Are you alone in
the house, ma'am?</i>

353
00:32:51,117 --> 00:32:52,251
Yes.

354
00:32:52,385 --> 00:32:53,852
<i>Are you sure?</i>

355
00:32:55,254 --> 00:32:59,624
What? <i>Are you sure you haven't
let something inside, Rose?</i>

356
00:33:02,228 --> 00:33:03,895
<i>Look behind you.</i>

357
00:33:34,326 --> 00:33:35,627
Shit.

358
00:33:43,269 --> 00:33:44,370
Hello?

359
00:33:44,503 --> 00:33:45,870
<i>This is First Line Security.</i>

360
00:33:46,004 --> 00:33:48,274
<i>May I have your name
and the passcode?</i>

361
00:34:09,095 --> 00:34:11,763
We did a full sweep inside
and out. It's all clear.

362
00:34:12,398 --> 00:34:14,400
Um, what about the back door?

363
00:34:14,533 --> 00:34:18,002
Is it possible it wasn't fully
latched last time it was closed?

364
00:34:19,472 --> 00:34:21,540
I... I don't know. Maybe.

365
00:34:21,673 --> 00:34:22,913
Hey, I wouldn't worry about it.

366
00:34:22,941 --> 00:34:25,344
These false alarms
happen all the time.

367
00:34:25,478 --> 00:34:28,280
If anything else comes up,
you can give us a call.

368
00:34:29,248 --> 00:34:30,282
Okay.

369
00:34:31,117 --> 00:34:32,518
Evening, sir.

370
00:34:32,650 --> 00:34:35,287
Um, evening.

371
00:34:38,890 --> 00:34:40,292
What happened?

372
00:34:43,728 --> 00:34:45,097
Mustache?

373
00:34:46,698 --> 00:34:48,234
Mustache.

374
00:34:48,367 --> 00:34:52,036
So, is there a reason
you set the alarm?

375
00:34:52,171 --> 00:34:53,171
Uh...

376
00:34:53,905 --> 00:34:55,441
I literally don't
remember doing it.

377
00:34:55,574 --> 00:34:59,010
I must have just, like, set
it by accident or something.

378
00:35:00,579 --> 00:35:02,046
By accident?

379
00:35:03,549 --> 00:35:04,782
Sorry. Sorry.

380
00:35:04,916 --> 00:35:06,918
My head has just
been in this, like,

381
00:35:07,051 --> 00:35:09,888
foggy, creepy,
spacey place all day.

382
00:35:10,021 --> 00:35:12,924
And there was this weird
incident at work and then...

383
00:35:13,058 --> 00:35:15,660
And then my boss is
making me take a...

384
00:35:19,431 --> 00:35:21,666
Sorry.

385
00:35:21,799 --> 00:35:24,702
Everything is
okay. Are you sure?

386
00:35:24,836 --> 00:35:27,972
No, no, I'm fine.
I was just venting.

387
00:35:29,774 --> 00:35:31,177
Okay.

388
00:35:36,014 --> 00:35:37,715
Can you see if you
can find Mustache?

389
00:35:37,849 --> 00:35:39,684
I haven't seen him
anywhere at all.

390
00:35:39,817 --> 00:35:41,153
Yeah.

391
00:35:47,626 --> 00:35:49,994
Rose, did you break
another glass?

392
00:35:54,667 --> 00:35:56,068
Mustache?

393
00:35:59,471 --> 00:36:00,972
Come on, kitty.

394
00:36:03,475 --> 00:36:05,743
Please. Please.

395
00:36:09,448 --> 00:36:10,882
Mustache.

396
00:37:05,970 --> 00:37:08,890
<i>It looks like
people. It looks like different people.</i>

397
00:37:08,973 --> 00:37:11,310
<i>Sometimes it pretends to
be someone that I know.</i>

398
00:37:11,443 --> 00:37:14,213
<i>Sometimes it's a random
stranger. Sometimes...</i>

399
00:37:14,346 --> 00:37:16,914
<i>Sometimes it looks
like my grandfather</i>

400
00:37:17,048 --> 00:37:19,618
<i>who died in front of
me when I was seven.</i>

401
00:37:19,752 --> 00:37:22,288
<i>- But it's all the same thing.
- It...</i>

402
00:37:22,421 --> 00:37:25,090
<i>It's smiling at me, but
not a friendly smile.</i>

403
00:37:25,224 --> 00:37:27,293
<i>It's the worst smile I've
ever seen in my life.</i>

404
00:37:27,426 --> 00:37:30,129
<i>And whenever I see it, I just
get this god-awful feeling</i>

405
00:37:30,262 --> 00:37:33,532
<i>like something really
terrible is gonna happen.</i>

406
00:37:34,866 --> 00:37:37,636
<i>Oh, my God! No! No!</i>

407
00:37:37,770 --> 00:37:40,506
<i>No! It's here! Please!</i>

408
00:37:40,639 --> 00:37:43,409
<i>Get away! Please! No!</i>

409
00:37:44,976 --> 00:37:47,011
<i>I... I have a
patient emergency in eval 2.</i>

410
00:37:47,146 --> 00:37:50,182
<i>I need staff here now. Hurry.</i>

411
00:37:51,816 --> 00:37:53,218
<i>Laura?</i>

412
00:38:03,995 --> 00:38:05,297
<i>Laura?</i>

413
00:38:16,475 --> 00:38:18,042
<i>Laura?</i>

414
00:38:18,177 --> 00:38:20,512
<i>Rose.</i>

415
00:38:28,520 --> 00:38:30,055
<i>Laura?</i>

416
00:38:38,764 --> 00:38:40,299
Rose!

417
00:38:51,577 --> 00:38:52,577
Rose?

418
00:38:52,678 --> 00:38:55,381
Whoa! Oh, my God!
Rose! Rose! Whoa, whoa!

419
00:38:55,514 --> 00:38:57,949
What the fuck? Rose,
put the knife down!

420
00:39:02,421 --> 00:39:03,421
Rose!

421
00:39:21,774 --> 00:39:23,108
Hi.

422
00:39:24,710 --> 00:39:26,145
Rose?

423
00:39:27,513 --> 00:39:29,214
This is a surprise.

424
00:39:31,583 --> 00:39:34,486
It wasn't
so much the blood.

425
00:39:34,620 --> 00:39:36,020
It was, um...

426
00:39:36,988 --> 00:39:38,757
her face.

427
00:39:38,891 --> 00:39:40,958
The look that she had.

428
00:39:41,926 --> 00:39:43,362
How did it make you feel?

429
00:39:44,962 --> 00:39:46,198
Uh...

430
00:39:46,698 --> 00:39:48,500
Terrified, obviously.

431
00:39:50,669 --> 00:39:51,703
Um...

432
00:39:52,671 --> 00:39:54,306
Vulnerable.

433
00:39:54,773 --> 00:39:56,175
Guilty.

434
00:39:56,575 --> 00:39:57,609
Guilty?

435
00:39:58,243 --> 00:39:59,812
Well, she was my patient.

436
00:39:59,944 --> 00:40:04,183
She was a disturbed young woman
you only met for ten minutes.

437
00:40:04,316 --> 00:40:06,452
Yeah. I just...

438
00:40:07,686 --> 00:40:09,388
I just feel like I've
gotten stuck on it.

439
00:40:09,521 --> 00:40:11,989
I can't, you know,
get it out of my head.

440
00:40:12,124 --> 00:40:15,627
Have you considered the
reason you feel stuck

441
00:40:15,761 --> 00:40:18,697
could actually be more
about your mother's suicide?

442
00:40:23,268 --> 00:40:25,471
Do you still blame yourself?

443
00:40:27,372 --> 00:40:28,841
That...

444
00:40:28,973 --> 00:40:30,442
I'm really not
trying to relitigate

445
00:40:30,576 --> 00:40:33,645
that part of my life
right now. So...

446
00:40:35,180 --> 00:40:37,349
What would you
like to talk about?

447
00:40:38,350 --> 00:40:44,423
I was hoping that I could
get a script for Risperdal.

448
00:40:50,596 --> 00:40:52,130
Ever since that...

449
00:40:53,932 --> 00:40:55,767
patient, I've been, um...

450
00:40:57,603 --> 00:40:59,505
seeing things

451
00:41:00,339 --> 00:41:02,274
and hearing things.

452
00:41:03,475 --> 00:41:06,278
I'm sure it's just a
symptom of post-trauma.

453
00:41:06,411 --> 00:41:09,181
Let's avoid any self-diagnosis.

454
00:41:10,415 --> 00:41:13,085
What is it you've been
seeing and hearing?

455
00:41:16,455 --> 00:41:19,224
Echoes of what happened
with my patient.

456
00:41:19,358 --> 00:41:21,894
You know, just fleeting moments

457
00:41:22,026 --> 00:41:24,429
of stress-induced
hallucinations.

458
00:41:25,631 --> 00:41:29,735
But when they're
happening, they feel so...

459
00:41:30,969 --> 00:41:34,840
corporeal and unsettling.

460
00:41:36,308 --> 00:41:40,479
Rose, from where I'm sitting, you don't
seem delusional or disordered to me.

461
00:41:41,213 --> 00:41:42,915
And certainly not psychotic.

462
00:41:43,047 --> 00:41:46,018
It's my impression this
experience with your patient

463
00:41:46,151 --> 00:41:47,519
triggered old anxieties

464
00:41:47,653 --> 00:41:49,755
compounded with too much
stress, not enough sleep.

465
00:41:49,888 --> 00:41:54,059
You have wounds that
have never fully healed.

466
00:41:55,794 --> 00:41:59,064
And it is possible they never will
completely. That's the nature of trauma.

467
00:41:59,197 --> 00:42:02,701
But you can learn to
get control over it.

468
00:42:04,102 --> 00:42:07,005
Have you been continuing
to see patients

469
00:42:07,139 --> 00:42:08,707
while you've been
coping with all this?

470
00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:13,078
No. I'm just taking
a short hiatus. Good.

471
00:42:14,279 --> 00:42:15,681
If you want my advice,

472
00:42:15,814 --> 00:42:17,482
use this time to do
something different.

473
00:42:17,616 --> 00:42:19,985
Anything that will
take your mind off

474
00:42:20,118 --> 00:42:22,220
the triggers that are
causing you stress.

475
00:42:22,354 --> 00:42:25,958
I also think it would be helpful

476
00:42:26,792 --> 00:42:29,628
if we resumed our
regular sessions again.

477
00:42:34,666 --> 00:42:35,867
Sure.

478
00:42:40,572 --> 00:42:43,442
And what about the
Risperdal? Just... You know.

479
00:42:43,575 --> 00:42:47,479
Let's talk again next week before
we consider any medication.

480
00:42:49,348 --> 00:42:51,817
In the meantime, you
can always call me.

481
00:42:55,687 --> 00:42:56,855
Sure.

482
00:43:28,286 --> 00:43:32,357
No, I asked you
for a white wine spritzer. Jesus.

483
00:43:33,558 --> 00:43:36,129
Oh, my God. You made
it. Hi. Surprise.

484
00:43:36,261 --> 00:43:37,829
Come on in. Come on in. Oh.

485
00:43:38,597 --> 00:43:40,465
I thought you had to work?

486
00:43:40,599 --> 00:43:43,136
Oh, I decided to take the
afternoon... I'll take that.

487
00:43:43,268 --> 00:43:44,736
Hey, Greg. What are you doing?

488
00:43:44,870 --> 00:43:47,472
I told you not to take
those out yet. Mmm, mmm.

489
00:43:47,606 --> 00:43:48,840
Geez.

490
00:43:48,974 --> 00:43:50,852
Uh, ladies, I have to go
corral my dipshit husband.

491
00:43:50,876 --> 00:43:53,578
Would one of you please show my
sister to the adult refreshments?

492
00:43:53,712 --> 00:43:56,181
Sure. We have a stash
in the kitchen. Come on.

493
00:43:56,314 --> 00:43:58,316
Wait. You're that
therapist, right?

494
00:43:58,450 --> 00:43:59,518
Yes, I... I am.

495
00:43:59,651 --> 00:44:01,420
Oh! Fantastic. Can
I ask for advice?

496
00:44:42,794 --> 00:44:45,497
So cool.

497
00:44:45,630 --> 00:44:48,867
<i>Gracias,</i> Harper.
<i>Gracias,</i> Harper's mom.

498
00:44:53,805 --> 00:44:55,874
Ooh, that one's from Aunt Rose.

499
00:44:58,810 --> 00:44:59,911
Open it!

500
00:45:01,012 --> 00:45:02,514
Rip it open!

501
00:45:17,696 --> 00:45:19,297
What'd you get, sweetheart?

502
00:45:33,745 --> 00:45:35,214
No. No.

503
00:45:35,347 --> 00:45:38,884
Oh, my God. No, no. Mustache.

504
00:45:41,686 --> 00:45:44,056
What the hell is wrong with you?

505
00:45:44,190 --> 00:45:45,824
This can't be happening.

506
00:45:50,595 --> 00:45:53,932
No. No, no. No, I promise
you, this wasn't me.

507
00:45:54,066 --> 00:45:57,469
It wasn't. It
wasn't me, I swear.

508
00:45:57,602 --> 00:46:00,572
You have to... You guys
have to believe me, please.

509
00:46:00,705 --> 00:46:03,942
Somebody please
fucking believe me.

510
00:46:12,751 --> 00:46:16,621
What the fuck are you?
Leave me the fuck alone!

511
00:46:16,755 --> 00:46:19,791
You see her. You
have to see her.

512
00:46:19,925 --> 00:46:22,994
Please, Holly, tell me
that you see somebody.

513
00:46:23,129 --> 00:46:24,396
Please.

514
00:46:32,537 --> 00:46:34,106
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, God.

515
00:46:55,627 --> 00:46:57,562
Hey, Rose.

516
00:46:58,197 --> 00:46:59,197
Fuck.

517
00:47:00,665 --> 00:47:02,105
I heard you were
brought into the ER.

518
00:47:02,201 --> 00:47:04,569
I wanted to come check
on you. How're you doing?

519
00:47:05,338 --> 00:47:06,671
Fine.

520
00:47:06,805 --> 00:47:09,374
It was just an
accident. Thank you.

521
00:47:09,507 --> 00:47:14,045
Yeah. They... They said that you
had had a anxiety attack.

522
00:47:15,081 --> 00:47:17,283
Rose, I'll be honest with
you, I'm... I'm concerned.

523
00:47:17,415 --> 00:47:18,815
And I... I mean
this as your friend,

524
00:47:18,850 --> 00:47:20,919
but I really think you
should speak to someone.

525
00:47:21,052 --> 00:47:23,388
Are you seeing anybody
professionally right now?

526
00:47:29,628 --> 00:47:31,596
Rose,
are you listening?

527
00:47:56,222 --> 00:47:57,455
Wait.

528
00:47:58,224 --> 00:47:59,891
I need to tell you something,

529
00:48:00,025 --> 00:48:06,031
and I need you to know
that I'm not crazy, okay?

530
00:48:06,798 --> 00:48:07,798
Okay.

531
00:48:07,866 --> 00:48:08,934
Okay.

532
00:48:09,968 --> 00:48:11,002
Um...

533
00:48:12,204 --> 00:48:16,508
Something is happening to me.

534
00:48:20,112 --> 00:48:23,149
And it's gonna be really
hard for you to believe.

535
00:48:25,984 --> 00:48:27,953
Maybe we should just go inside.

536
00:48:28,087 --> 00:48:31,556
No, wait. Just listen
to me! Sorry. Sorry.

537
00:48:32,291 --> 00:48:33,792
I'm really sorry.

538
00:48:34,293 --> 00:48:35,727
Okay, um...

539
00:48:37,562 --> 00:48:39,298
Something is threatening me.

540
00:48:40,066 --> 00:48:45,570
Some kind of a evil
spirit, or energy.

541
00:48:45,704 --> 00:48:50,142
I... I don't really
know what it is, but...

542
00:48:50,276 --> 00:48:53,545
But I think that it...
It killed my patient.

543
00:48:53,678 --> 00:48:58,150
Because she described experiencing
the same thing before she died.

544
00:48:58,284 --> 00:49:02,520
And now it's somehow
attached itself to me.

545
00:49:03,955 --> 00:49:05,023
And...

546
00:49:06,359 --> 00:49:07,460
I'm just really scared

547
00:49:07,592 --> 00:49:10,262
that something bad
is going to happen.

548
00:49:16,469 --> 00:49:18,703
I really need you
to say something.

549
00:49:19,571 --> 00:49:21,606
What do you want me to say?

550
00:49:25,877 --> 00:49:27,113
I want you to believe me.

551
00:49:27,246 --> 00:49:29,482
Rose, you're talking
about a fucking ghost.

552
00:49:29,614 --> 00:49:31,516
No, no, no. It's not...

553
00:49:31,649 --> 00:49:33,119
It's not a ghost.

554
00:49:33,918 --> 00:49:35,787
It's something else.

555
00:49:35,920 --> 00:49:37,123
Okay.

556
00:49:40,759 --> 00:49:42,228
I'm sorry.

557
00:49:43,362 --> 00:49:44,430
I can't.

558
00:49:45,164 --> 00:49:47,133
I cannot fucking
do this right now.

559
00:49:47,266 --> 00:49:48,633
No. Trevor.

560
00:49:48,767 --> 00:49:51,070
Whoa, whoa, wait. No,
no, no. Don't walk away.

561
00:49:52,371 --> 00:49:53,571
I need you...

562
00:49:53,705 --> 00:49:55,150
You're not listening
to what I am saying.

563
00:49:55,174 --> 00:49:56,574
Okay, Rose.

564
00:49:56,708 --> 00:50:01,012
What the fuck am I supposed to
say to respond to this right now?

565
00:50:01,147 --> 00:50:03,681
Do you hear yourself? I mean,
Jesus Christ. You sound crazy.

566
00:50:03,815 --> 00:50:05,518
I am not crazy!

567
00:50:05,650 --> 00:50:07,752
Sorry. Sorry.

568
00:50:08,487 --> 00:50:10,289
But it's genetic, isn't it?

569
00:50:11,390 --> 00:50:12,791
What?

570
00:50:13,825 --> 00:50:15,294
Mental illness.

571
00:50:16,095 --> 00:50:18,297
You can inherit
it from a parent.

572
00:50:18,431 --> 00:50:19,431
I looked it up.

573
00:50:19,498 --> 00:50:21,067
Why would you look that up?

574
00:50:21,900 --> 00:50:24,303
Because... I wanted to know

575
00:50:24,437 --> 00:50:28,039
what I was potentially
hitching my entire life to.

576
00:50:29,408 --> 00:50:31,210
Is that so fucking unfair?

577
00:50:33,845 --> 00:50:35,147
I'm going in the house.

578
00:50:35,281 --> 00:50:37,849
No, no, no. Please,
Trevor. I'm in danger!

579
00:50:37,982 --> 00:50:39,050
Rose.

580
00:50:39,717 --> 00:50:41,719
Did you kill
Mustache? N... No!

581
00:50:41,853 --> 00:50:45,524
No! That was not...
That was not me.

582
00:50:45,657 --> 00:50:48,960
Then tell me, what
happened to him?

583
00:50:50,463 --> 00:50:52,931
It was the thing.

584
00:50:54,133 --> 00:50:56,000
Trevor, please.

585
00:50:56,135 --> 00:50:57,936
Please. Please.

586
00:50:59,171 --> 00:51:01,207
Please. Please.

587
00:52:15,847 --> 00:52:17,682
Rose.

588
00:52:26,659 --> 00:52:28,026
Come here.

589
00:52:57,623 --> 00:52:58,856
Rose.

590
00:53:01,660 --> 00:53:03,062
Baby...

591
00:53:03,995 --> 00:53:06,965
Please. Help me.

592
00:53:08,133 --> 00:53:11,237
- Mommy made a mistake.
- No, no, no.

593
00:53:13,938 --> 00:53:15,374
No, no, no.

594
00:53:18,277 --> 00:53:19,645
Rose!

595
00:53:19,777 --> 00:53:20,955
Look
where you're going!

596
00:53:20,979 --> 00:53:23,415
Are you crazy?
Sorry. I'm sorry.

597
00:53:46,305 --> 00:53:47,473
Mrs. Muñoz?

598
00:53:50,442 --> 00:53:51,843
At first,

599
00:53:51,976 --> 00:53:54,346
I noticed small changes in him.

600
00:53:57,048 --> 00:53:59,518
Then it all happened so fast.

601
00:54:01,520 --> 00:54:03,088
He was on edge.

602
00:54:03,788 --> 00:54:05,291
Paranoid.

603
00:54:06,692 --> 00:54:10,296
He would wake up in the middle
of the night, screaming.

604
00:54:12,298 --> 00:54:14,832
I'd never heard
him scream before.

605
00:54:17,102 --> 00:54:20,205
Then he just stopped
sleeping altogether.

606
00:54:22,840 --> 00:54:26,545
I would catch him having these
conversations with himself.

607
00:54:26,679 --> 00:54:28,314
He was seeing things.

608
00:54:29,081 --> 00:54:30,249
Doing strange things

609
00:54:30,382 --> 00:54:32,685
that he didn't even
seem to remember.

610
00:54:33,285 --> 00:54:35,387
Then one morning he was gone.

611
00:54:36,689 --> 00:54:41,126
That night, the police called
and told me he was dead.

612
00:54:44,463 --> 00:54:46,565
They asked me to
identify his body.

613
00:54:47,633 --> 00:54:49,967
His face.

614
00:54:51,969 --> 00:54:54,038
Twenty-five
years of marriage,

615
00:54:54,173 --> 00:54:57,242
and that's what I have
left to remember him.

616
00:55:00,912 --> 00:55:03,014
I'm so sorry.

617
00:55:13,592 --> 00:55:19,098
Did Gabriel ever describe the
things that he was seeing?

618
00:55:23,635 --> 00:55:25,036
I'll show you.

619
00:55:36,648 --> 00:55:38,617
I should take it all down,

620
00:55:39,485 --> 00:55:41,653
but I can't stand being in here.

621
00:56:00,339 --> 00:56:03,275
This is what
Gabriel said he saw.

622
00:56:11,383 --> 00:56:15,554
He kept saying it was
trying to get inside of him.

623
00:56:17,989 --> 00:56:20,459
That is Gabriel's brother.

624
00:56:20,592 --> 00:56:24,163
He died in an
accident 20 years ago.

625
00:56:24,296 --> 00:56:27,232
Gabriel never got over it.

626
00:56:27,366 --> 00:56:29,134
How long had
this been going on?

627
00:56:29,268 --> 00:56:33,071
Ever since he got back from that damn
conference he would go to every year.

628
00:56:34,606 --> 00:56:38,143
It was because he saw that
awful woman kill herself.

629
00:56:39,745 --> 00:56:41,513
But no one reports on that.

630
00:56:43,916 --> 00:56:47,051
He watched someone
die by suicide?

631
00:56:48,587 --> 00:56:49,621
Yes.

632
00:56:50,155 --> 00:56:51,156
I assumed you knew this.

633
00:56:51,290 --> 00:56:52,957
What was her name?

634
00:56:54,126 --> 00:56:56,562
I don't remember.
I'd have to find it.

635
00:56:59,765 --> 00:57:00,998
Um...

636
00:57:01,834 --> 00:57:04,470
Did... Did he ever, um...

637
00:57:06,438 --> 00:57:08,207
say why all of
this was happening?

638
00:57:08,340 --> 00:57:12,043
Did he find any
explanation in all of this?

639
00:57:13,879 --> 00:57:15,214
What kind of reporter are you?

640
00:57:15,347 --> 00:57:19,651
Mrs. Muñoz, your
husband was not insane.

641
00:57:19,785 --> 00:57:23,288
The things that he was seeing,
they're real. I've seen them.

642
00:57:23,422 --> 00:57:26,225
What are you, a fucking nutcase?

643
00:57:26,358 --> 00:57:27,960
What? Some kind
of morbid fanatic?

644
00:57:28,093 --> 00:57:29,795
How fucking dare you?

645
00:57:29,928 --> 00:57:31,296
No, please. Please.

646
00:57:31,430 --> 00:57:33,799
What happened to your
husband is happening to me.

647
00:57:33,932 --> 00:57:35,968
Out of my house. I want
you out of my house, now.

648
00:57:36,101 --> 00:57:38,670
Just please give me the name.
Please, just give me the name!

649
00:57:38,804 --> 00:57:41,373
Get the fuck out of my house!

650
00:58:17,209 --> 00:58:19,144
Oh, fuck. Shit.

651
00:58:31,823 --> 00:58:33,158
Yeah?

652
00:58:39,598 --> 00:58:40,699
Hey.

653
00:58:47,272 --> 00:58:48,774
Come on in.

654
00:59:02,487 --> 00:59:06,191
Finally got rid of
that ugly yellow couch.

655
00:59:07,192 --> 00:59:08,594
Uh-huh.

656
00:59:09,194 --> 00:59:11,430
So, uh, what's up?

657
00:59:12,397 --> 00:59:14,232
I assume you're not
here to catch up

658
00:59:14,366 --> 00:59:17,536
considering the cold
shoulder the other day.

659
00:59:19,271 --> 00:59:21,406
I need a favor.

660
00:59:21,540 --> 00:59:23,709
I need you to not ask
any questions about it.

661
00:59:23,842 --> 00:59:26,778
Terrific. Yeah,
let's hear that.

662
00:59:26,912 --> 00:59:28,513
Uh, so, nine days ago,

663
00:59:28,647 --> 00:59:31,984
a man named Gabriel
Muñoz killed himself.

664
00:59:32,117 --> 00:59:38,023
I need to know if he had been involved
in any other recent police reports.

665
00:59:38,156 --> 00:59:40,726
Can you find that
out? Here, for me.

666
00:59:40,859 --> 00:59:42,661
Come on. Are you serious?

667
00:59:44,262 --> 00:59:46,765
This is my one day
off. Go to the station.

668
00:59:46,898 --> 00:59:48,400
Joel, please?

669
00:59:55,108 --> 00:59:56,341
Fine.

670
00:59:57,142 --> 00:59:58,610
Goddamn it.

671
01:00:03,082 --> 01:00:04,916
All right, what
was his name again?

672
01:00:05,684 --> 01:00:07,419
Gabriel Muñoz.

673
01:00:15,427 --> 01:00:18,163
All right. I see the
report on his death.

674
01:00:18,296 --> 01:00:20,365
Yeah. There's another
incident report here

675
01:00:20,499 --> 01:00:22,801
from a week earlier,
from a precinct upstate.

676
01:00:22,934 --> 01:00:25,904
What was it for? He gave
a witness statement.

677
01:00:26,038 --> 01:00:28,674
He was staying at a hotel where
a woman committed suicide.

678
01:00:28,807 --> 01:00:31,843
Okay, um... And what
was her name? The woman?

679
01:00:35,981 --> 01:00:37,182
Um,

680
01:00:37,315 --> 01:00:39,184
Angela Powell.

681
01:00:39,317 --> 01:00:40,852
She's a real estate agent.

682
01:00:40,986 --> 01:00:42,287
What is this?

683
01:00:44,256 --> 01:00:46,425
Fuck. What? What is it?

684
01:00:47,292 --> 01:00:48,827
It's a picture from the scene.

685
01:00:48,960 --> 01:00:50,862
Let me see it. No.

686
01:00:50,996 --> 01:00:52,464
Let me see it. No, no.

687
01:00:52,597 --> 01:00:54,509
Look, you don't wanna see
this. This is, like, evidence.

688
01:00:54,533 --> 01:00:56,902
Or, just, you know, have at it.

689
01:01:00,238 --> 01:01:01,606
Holy shit.

690
01:01:03,076 --> 01:01:04,876
Told you it was gross.

691
01:01:06,945 --> 01:01:08,280
Okay, um...

692
01:01:09,848 --> 01:01:13,186
Okay, uh, I need you to do the same
search again, but this time on her.

693
01:01:13,318 --> 01:01:14,553
The woman, Angela.

694
01:01:14,686 --> 01:01:16,264
Can you please tell me
what this is all about?

695
01:01:16,288 --> 01:01:19,424
Joel, you said you weren't
gonna ask me any questions.

696
01:01:19,558 --> 01:01:21,760
No. You said I wouldn't
ask you any questions.

697
01:01:21,893 --> 01:01:23,829
Joel, I need your help.

698
01:01:24,830 --> 01:01:26,231
Okay?

699
01:01:29,301 --> 01:01:30,569
Please?

700
01:01:48,620 --> 01:01:49,354
Hmm.

701
01:01:49,488 --> 01:01:51,057
There was a previous report

702
01:01:51,190 --> 01:01:53,725
filed four days
before her death.

703
01:01:55,061 --> 01:01:56,428
That's a weird coincidence.

704
01:01:56,561 --> 01:01:58,964
She was also interviewed
about a suicide.

705
01:02:08,640 --> 01:02:11,376
What is this? Is
that a video file?

706
01:02:14,479 --> 01:02:16,782
It's, um, security
camera footage.

707
01:02:16,915 --> 01:02:20,352
Put it... Put it on. Just...
It's... It's loading.

708
01:02:30,096 --> 01:02:31,963
What the fuck is this?

709
01:03:04,329 --> 01:03:06,265
You know, my day
was going just fine.

710
01:03:06,398 --> 01:03:08,366
Can you rewind it? Really?

711
01:03:08,500 --> 01:03:10,368
Rewind it, Joel.

712
01:03:15,540 --> 01:03:16,641
Okay, stop.

713
01:03:23,249 --> 01:03:24,950
Is he smiling?

714
01:03:34,227 --> 01:03:36,062
Rose, who are these people?

715
01:03:44,337 --> 01:03:45,871
I have to go.

716
01:03:46,571 --> 01:03:48,074
Where are you going?

717
01:03:49,908 --> 01:03:52,577
Rose, where are you going?
What is going on here?

718
01:03:52,711 --> 01:03:54,213
I'm so confused right now.

719
01:03:54,347 --> 01:03:55,981
Can you do me one more favor?

720
01:03:56,615 --> 01:03:58,117
Do you have a printer?

721
01:04:37,223 --> 01:04:39,591
Trevor. Trevor, you here?

722
01:04:40,825 --> 01:04:41,860
Hey.

723
01:04:41,993 --> 01:04:43,528
Hi, Rose.

724
01:04:45,630 --> 01:04:47,766
What is this? What
is she doing here?

725
01:04:47,899 --> 01:04:49,668
I wanted to see
how you were doing.

726
01:04:49,801 --> 01:04:51,903
I was talking to my fiancé.

727
01:04:53,471 --> 01:04:54,673
I called her.

728
01:04:56,841 --> 01:04:57,842
Why?

729
01:04:59,211 --> 01:05:03,915
Because you've been acting
completely unhinged.

730
01:05:04,049 --> 01:05:05,049
I... I don't...

731
01:05:05,151 --> 01:05:06,751
And I... I didn't
know what else to do.

732
01:05:06,885 --> 01:05:08,553
Are you
fucking kidding me?

733
01:05:09,754 --> 01:05:13,491
I came to you, the person I'm
supposed to trust most in the world,

734
01:05:13,625 --> 01:05:17,862
and I... I confided that
I was scared to death.

735
01:05:18,364 --> 01:05:21,100
That I needed you.

736
01:05:22,767 --> 01:05:24,736
And you didn't listen
to a word I was saying.

737
01:05:24,869 --> 01:05:27,406
No. Why do you think
I even called her?

738
01:05:27,539 --> 01:05:29,442
All I'm trying to
do here is help you.

739
01:05:29,574 --> 01:05:32,454
No! All you're trying to do is make
it so you don't have to deal with it.

740
01:05:32,577 --> 01:05:36,415
You're fine as long as
everything is easy and agreeable,

741
01:05:36,548 --> 01:05:38,850
but God forbid
anything become real,

742
01:05:38,984 --> 01:05:40,719
or even a tiny bit difficult.

743
01:05:40,852 --> 01:05:42,787
And... And you just...

744
01:05:42,921 --> 01:05:46,624
You just think about how it's gonna fuck
up your whole little perfect life plan.

745
01:05:46,758 --> 01:05:49,395
Are you serious
right now? Yeah.

746
01:05:49,527 --> 01:05:52,264
If that's how you feel, then
why are we even together?

747
01:05:53,399 --> 01:05:54,599
Maybe I just don't know.

748
01:05:54,733 --> 01:05:56,178
Why don't we all
just take a breath...

749
01:05:56,202 --> 01:05:59,037
Why don't you just fucking
make yourself at home!

750
01:05:59,171 --> 01:06:02,141
Rose, are you actually
leaving right now?

751
01:06:13,718 --> 01:06:15,754
Greg. Rose, what
are you doing here?

752
01:06:15,887 --> 01:06:17,165
Is Holly here? I
need to talk to her.

753
01:06:17,189 --> 01:06:18,857
I don't think
that's a good idea.

754
01:06:18,990 --> 01:06:20,959
Greg, let me talk to my
fucking sister. Holly!

755
01:06:21,093 --> 01:06:22,737
You're gonna come and
talk to me like that?

756
01:06:22,761 --> 01:06:24,373
Holly, can I talk to
you, just for one sec?

757
01:06:24,397 --> 01:06:26,141
No, I don't think... Can
I please talk to you?

758
01:06:26,165 --> 01:06:27,899
I don't think this is
a good idea. Honestly.

759
01:06:28,033 --> 01:06:29,768
Yeah, it's fine.
It's fine. Holly.

760
01:06:29,901 --> 01:06:33,038
Just go the fuck inside. I
don't... All right. Fine.

761
01:06:34,106 --> 01:06:35,307
Jesus.

762
01:06:36,509 --> 01:06:38,009
Okay, okay, okay.

763
01:06:40,513 --> 01:06:41,880
How are you?

764
01:06:42,647 --> 01:06:46,218
My eyes are open now.

765
01:06:47,286 --> 01:06:50,256
I have been cursed.

766
01:06:50,688 --> 01:06:51,723
Okay, uh...

767
01:06:51,856 --> 01:06:53,725
Or somehow wrapped
up in a curse.

768
01:06:53,858 --> 01:06:55,593
I... I got it from my patient.

769
01:06:55,727 --> 01:06:59,365
She was cursed, and then when she
died, she... she transferred it to me.

770
01:06:59,498 --> 01:07:05,204
And now I'm being threatened
by this... this entity.

771
01:07:05,904 --> 01:07:07,440
By an entity? No, no.

772
01:07:07,572 --> 01:07:09,040
It... It's what killed Mustache.

773
01:07:09,175 --> 01:07:12,545
It was at the party yesterday,
but you couldn't see it.

774
01:07:12,677 --> 01:07:15,214
Nobody else can see
it, except for me.

775
01:07:15,713 --> 01:07:16,713
Jesus Christ.

776
01:07:16,781 --> 01:07:17,849
No, look, Holly,

777
01:07:17,982 --> 01:07:19,951
I know it's so hard to believe,

778
01:07:20,086 --> 01:07:22,687
and it was difficult for me
to believe it at first either.

779
01:07:22,821 --> 01:07:24,356
But look... look at this. Look.

780
01:07:24,490 --> 01:07:27,926
Oh, my God. Rose. Why the
fuck do you have that?

781
01:07:28,060 --> 01:07:29,794
Because this has
happened to other people.

782
01:07:29,928 --> 01:07:31,197
And they're all dead. Rose.

783
01:07:31,330 --> 01:07:32,797
And I... Holly,
I'm gonna be next!

784
01:07:32,931 --> 01:07:35,067
Rose, curses are not real.

785
01:07:35,201 --> 01:07:37,635
Okay? You are having
some sort of a...

786
01:07:39,138 --> 01:07:40,672
A breakdown.

787
01:07:40,805 --> 01:07:43,741
What? No, no. Holly.

788
01:07:44,443 --> 01:07:45,578
You're not hearing me.

789
01:07:45,710 --> 01:07:48,481
You are not hearing me. Rose.

790
01:07:48,613 --> 01:07:51,383
This is exactly what
happened to Mom.

791
01:07:56,688 --> 01:07:58,324
You sound just like her.

792
01:08:03,728 --> 01:08:05,730
How the fuck would
you know that?

793
01:08:06,265 --> 01:08:07,265
I'm sorry, what?

794
01:08:07,333 --> 01:08:09,033
You were never around
when Mom got bad.

795
01:08:09,168 --> 01:08:10,835
Where the fuck were
you when she died?

796
01:08:10,969 --> 01:08:13,439
You have no idea what
you're talking about.

797
01:08:13,572 --> 01:08:16,542
Okay? Because I was older, I
got the worst of Mom's insanity.

798
01:08:16,674 --> 01:08:18,110
I had to fucking
leave the house.

799
01:08:18,244 --> 01:08:21,213
That was the only way
I... I could survive.

800
01:08:22,615 --> 01:08:24,716
And I'm... I'm sorry

801
01:08:25,884 --> 01:08:29,854
that I left you alone and that
you had to be the one to find her.

802
01:08:29,988 --> 01:08:32,324
I know that that
fucked you up, and...

803
01:08:33,325 --> 01:08:34,692
And I know that that's not fair.

804
01:08:34,826 --> 01:08:36,266
I wish I could do
something about it,

805
01:08:36,395 --> 01:08:38,830
but, Rose, I have tried so
hard to move on with my life,

806
01:08:38,963 --> 01:08:40,932
to leave all of that
shit behind me, okay?

807
01:08:41,066 --> 01:08:43,169
You, it's like you
can't accept the fact

808
01:08:43,302 --> 01:08:45,638
that Mom lost her mind and
fucking killed herself.

809
01:08:45,770 --> 01:08:47,215
And you let it define
your entire life,

810
01:08:47,239 --> 01:08:49,040
and you punish me
because I don't want to.

811
01:08:49,175 --> 01:08:51,843
Well, I'm sorry that I'm
actually trying to help people

812
01:08:51,976 --> 01:08:55,414
instead of being some fucking
stay-at-home PTA housewife,

813
01:08:55,548 --> 01:09:00,152
who lives in her own
self-centered, smug little bubble!

814
01:09:04,456 --> 01:09:06,958
Okay. I don't know
why I said that.

815
01:09:08,460 --> 01:09:12,097
You know what, I'm... I'm not doing
this. I'm not doing this with you.

816
01:09:12,231 --> 01:09:14,832
You've completely
traumatized Jackson, okay?

817
01:09:16,101 --> 01:09:18,803
I can't have you around
when you're like this.

818
01:09:30,216 --> 01:09:31,383
Fuck.

819
01:09:32,784 --> 01:09:34,052
Fuck.

820
01:10:02,681 --> 01:10:04,849
Holly?

821
01:10:15,494 --> 01:10:18,664
Fuck! Fuck!

822
01:10:21,833 --> 01:10:24,169
Fuck!

823
01:10:24,769 --> 01:10:26,472
Motherfucker!

824
01:11:33,905 --> 01:11:35,973
Joel? Why didn't you tell me

825
01:11:36,108 --> 01:11:38,677
about your patient's
connection to the others?

826
01:11:38,811 --> 01:11:40,646
Wha... <i>After you
left, I kept digging.</i>

827
01:11:40,779 --> 01:11:42,314
These cases?

828
01:11:42,448 --> 01:11:44,149
This same pattern.
It goes back further.

829
01:11:44,283 --> 01:11:47,086
So far, I've found 20 cases
involving 19 suicide victims

830
01:11:47,219 --> 01:11:49,154
with a direct line
linking them all together.

831
01:11:49,288 --> 01:11:52,291
And the things these people
are doing to themselves, Rose.

832
01:11:52,424 --> 01:11:53,559
<i>Holy shit.</i>

833
01:11:53,692 --> 01:11:57,196
Wait, you said, um, 20
cases, but only 19 suicides.

834
01:11:57,329 --> 01:11:58,963
One of the cases
mixes up the pattern.

835
01:11:59,098 --> 01:12:00,799
Some accountant, Robert Talley.

836
01:12:00,932 --> 01:12:03,268
<i>His business partner commits
suicide right in front of him,</i>

837
01:12:03,402 --> 01:12:05,002
and four days later, Talley goes

838
01:12:05,137 --> 01:12:07,014
and fucking murders a woman
he's never met before,

839
01:12:07,038 --> 01:12:08,207
completely out of the blue.

840
01:12:08,340 --> 01:12:10,642
But get this, a week later,

841
01:12:10,776 --> 01:12:12,511
the key eyewitness to the murder

842
01:12:12,644 --> 01:12:14,580
also commits suicide.

843
01:12:14,713 --> 01:12:15,880
Pattern resumes.

844
01:12:16,013 --> 01:12:17,915
<i>So, he's alive?</i> Yeah.

845
01:12:18,049 --> 01:12:19,618
He's sitting in
holding in Altoona.

846
01:12:20,252 --> 01:12:22,287
Joel, I gotta talk to him.

847
01:12:49,415 --> 01:12:50,816
I'm gonna need you
to say something.

848
01:12:50,948 --> 01:12:52,551
Yeah, I... I will.

849
01:12:52,684 --> 01:12:54,353
Just... Just...

850
01:12:56,321 --> 01:12:57,723
Give me a second.
I mean, Jesus...

851
01:12:57,856 --> 01:13:00,259
I thought you were gonna say
this was some kind of, like,

852
01:13:00,392 --> 01:13:02,761
crazy suicide cult,
or blackmail scheme.

853
01:13:02,895 --> 01:13:06,030
I mean, this? This is...
This? This is... Hey, Joel.

854
01:13:08,032 --> 01:13:09,168
Okay.

855
01:13:09,301 --> 01:13:11,603
Let's just put aside
the possibility

856
01:13:11,737 --> 01:13:12,970
that some sort of evil,

857
01:13:13,105 --> 01:13:15,039
extraordinary force
could even exist.

858
01:13:16,040 --> 01:13:17,109
What you're saying

859
01:13:17,242 --> 01:13:19,445
is that this thing
is jumping around

860
01:13:19,578 --> 01:13:20,578
from person to person,

861
01:13:20,679 --> 01:13:23,115
and it is causing them
to kill themselves?

862
01:13:23,248 --> 01:13:25,584
Okay, but maybe
it's not suicide.

863
01:13:25,717 --> 01:13:26,852
What do you mean?

864
01:13:26,984 --> 01:13:29,221
Okay. So, my patient,
she was terrified,

865
01:13:29,354 --> 01:13:30,823
but she was not suicidal.

866
01:13:30,955 --> 01:13:34,226
And then at... at the end,
everything about her changed.

867
01:13:34,359 --> 01:13:40,165
It was like the person I had
been talking to was gone.

868
01:13:41,266 --> 01:13:45,404
And something else
had taken over.

869
01:13:48,440 --> 01:13:50,909
So, it's
kind of like the guy...

870
01:13:51,042 --> 01:13:52,811
Yes. on the security
camera footage?

871
01:13:52,945 --> 01:13:54,847
Yes. Yes.
Exactly like that.

872
01:13:54,979 --> 01:13:57,982
Oh, my God. What the fuck?

873
01:14:03,988 --> 01:14:06,358
In the cases that
you found, um...

874
01:14:08,126 --> 01:14:12,130
how long was it between
each victim's death?

875
01:14:16,134 --> 01:14:18,370
None of them survived
longer than a week.

876
01:14:21,640 --> 01:14:25,644
Some of them didn't even
make it past four days.

877
01:14:31,717 --> 01:14:33,185
Today was my fourth day.

878
01:14:34,953 --> 01:14:36,288
Hey.

879
01:14:37,356 --> 01:14:38,757
Whatever happened
to those people,

880
01:14:38,891 --> 01:14:40,759
it's not gonna happen to you.

881
01:14:43,629 --> 01:14:44,730
I promise.

882
01:15:05,450 --> 01:15:07,319
<i>Transfer
guard to gate three.</i>

883
01:15:07,452 --> 01:15:09,254
<i>Transfer guard to gate three.</i>

884
01:15:09,388 --> 01:15:10,455
Thank you.

885
01:15:10,589 --> 01:15:11,957
Give them
a buzz through.

886
01:15:12,090 --> 01:15:14,393
They're clear.

887
01:15:15,160 --> 01:15:16,628
I owe you
one for this, Doug.

888
01:15:16,762 --> 01:15:19,665
You're just lucky
that he fired every lawyer

889
01:15:19,798 --> 01:15:20,899
he was assigned.

890
01:15:21,033 --> 01:15:22,901
You do know what
this guy did, right?

891
01:15:23,035 --> 01:15:25,304
Well, Dr. Cotter's building
a psychological profile

892
01:15:25,437 --> 01:15:26,872
on a similar case for us.

893
01:15:27,005 --> 01:15:30,042
Oh. Well, Talley's a
whole box of fruit loops.

894
01:15:30,175 --> 01:15:31,543
So, good luck.

895
01:15:31,677 --> 01:15:33,579
Look, you only got ten
minutes with him, okay?

896
01:15:33,712 --> 01:15:35,948
It's the best I could do
without a court order.

897
01:15:36,081 --> 01:15:37,816
Well, I appreciate it.

898
01:16:12,851 --> 01:16:15,587
Mr. Talley, my name
is Dr. Rose Cotter,

899
01:16:15,721 --> 01:16:19,358
and, um, I was hoping
you'd be willing to

900
01:16:19,491 --> 01:16:21,426
answer some questions about...

901
01:16:21,560 --> 01:16:23,829
I'm done answering
questions. I confessed.

902
01:16:23,962 --> 01:16:27,232
I actually don't care about
what you were accused of.

903
01:16:27,366 --> 01:16:33,171
What I need to know is what you
experienced in the days leading up to it.

904
01:16:38,243 --> 01:16:40,145
I have a patient,

905
01:16:40,946 --> 01:16:42,481
a young woman.

906
01:16:44,182 --> 01:16:45,350
Four days ago,

907
01:16:45,484 --> 01:16:47,953
a man killed himself
right in front of her.

908
01:16:48,087 --> 01:16:55,193
And ever since then, she has
been seeing something.

909
01:16:56,628 --> 01:16:59,464
Something that pretends
to be other people.

910
01:17:00,165 --> 01:17:02,901
The man that she
saw kill himself,

911
01:17:03,035 --> 01:17:07,272
he claimed that he was
seeing the exact same thing.

912
01:17:07,406 --> 01:17:09,541
What the fuck do you
want from me, huh?

913
01:17:09,675 --> 01:17:12,277
What is it? I don't know.

914
01:17:13,311 --> 01:17:14,311
I don't know.

915
01:17:14,379 --> 01:17:15,647
Why is it that everybody else

916
01:17:15,781 --> 01:17:18,684
who's seen it is dead
and you're alive?

917
01:17:18,817 --> 01:17:19,818
Why? Please.

918
01:17:19,951 --> 01:17:22,521
Mr. Talley, you
can help her. Okay?

919
01:17:22,988 --> 01:17:24,289
Please.

920
01:17:28,827 --> 01:17:29,928
Make the cop leave.

921
01:17:31,863 --> 01:17:33,398
Not gonna happen, pal.

922
01:17:33,532 --> 01:17:37,369
Make him leave, and I'll
tell you what I know.

923
01:17:40,405 --> 01:17:41,940
Joel, please.

924
01:17:47,546 --> 01:17:49,448
I'll be outside, all right?

925
01:18:02,061 --> 01:18:05,530
I tried to research anything and
everything I could about this thing.

926
01:18:05,664 --> 01:18:07,833
There's been other
chains in the past.

927
01:18:07,966 --> 01:18:10,969
Found one that was in
Brazil a few years ago.

928
01:18:13,672 --> 01:18:16,608
A man there escaped that chain

929
01:18:17,843 --> 01:18:21,446
by killing his neighbor and
passing it to his neighbor's wife.

930
01:18:22,247 --> 01:18:25,283
Your patient is going to die

931
01:18:25,417 --> 01:18:27,652
unless she kills someone.

932
01:18:27,786 --> 01:18:30,522
That's the only way
you can get rid of it.

933
01:18:31,124 --> 01:18:32,624
The only way.

934
01:18:32,758 --> 01:18:35,228
She has to make sure there's
a witness for it to pass to,

935
01:18:35,360 --> 01:18:37,329
'cause this thing
needs trauma to spread.

936
01:18:37,462 --> 01:18:41,100
That's what gives
it power. Trauma.

937
01:18:41,234 --> 01:18:43,735
Your patient has
to make it count.

938
01:18:43,869 --> 01:18:46,404
Tell her to use
some kind of weapon.

939
01:18:46,538 --> 01:18:48,540
Make the biggest mess she can...

940
01:18:48,673 --> 01:18:51,676
I can't kill someone!

941
01:18:53,011 --> 01:18:54,312
You?

942
01:18:55,013 --> 01:18:57,048
You have it?

943
01:18:58,450 --> 01:19:02,121
No, no, no. Why the
fuck did you come here?

944
01:19:02,255 --> 01:19:03,755
You're not giving it back to me.

945
01:19:03,889 --> 01:19:06,024
Get out of here! I'm sorry.

946
01:19:06,159 --> 01:19:07,260
Get out of here!

947
01:19:07,392 --> 01:19:09,195
Get her away from me!

948
01:19:09,327 --> 01:19:11,797
Get her away from me!

949
01:19:11,930 --> 01:19:13,932
Get her away from me!

950
01:19:14,066 --> 01:19:15,767
Get her away from me!

951
01:19:23,041 --> 01:19:24,409
Hey.

952
01:19:25,244 --> 01:19:26,945
Hey! Wait.

953
01:19:28,914 --> 01:19:30,882
What happened in
there? Nothing.

954
01:19:31,583 --> 01:19:32,984
What'd he say?

955
01:19:34,753 --> 01:19:35,887
Nothing.

956
01:19:36,488 --> 01:19:38,390
Nothing?

957
01:19:38,523 --> 01:19:40,625
He's out of his
fucking mind, Joel.

958
01:21:25,131 --> 01:21:26,531
Ah, fuck.

959
01:22:21,320 --> 01:22:22,988
What are you doing here?

960
01:22:23,122 --> 01:22:25,124
I apologize if you felt
ambushed yesterday.

961
01:22:25,257 --> 01:22:26,758
That was the wrong approach.

962
01:22:26,891 --> 01:22:27,892
I'm sorry. Yeah.

963
01:22:28,026 --> 01:22:30,196
I think you should go. Rose.

964
01:22:30,329 --> 01:22:33,132
We both know I have a responsibility
to notify the authorities

965
01:22:33,265 --> 01:22:35,700
if you're a danger to
yourself or others.

966
01:22:35,834 --> 01:22:38,837
I need you to help convince
me you're not a danger.

967
01:22:51,450 --> 01:22:54,153
Trevor mentioned there
had been talk of ghosts.

968
01:22:55,388 --> 01:22:57,622
I never used the
word "ghosts."

969
01:22:58,957 --> 01:23:01,826
Evil beings, then. Paranormal.

970
01:23:03,928 --> 01:23:08,467
I admitted to him that I was seeing
things, the same thing that I told you.

971
01:23:08,600 --> 01:23:09,968
That's not happening
anymore. Okay?

972
01:23:10,102 --> 01:23:13,738
It was stress and lack of sleep.

973
01:23:13,872 --> 01:23:16,841
I confided in him, and that
was obviously a mistake.

974
01:23:17,276 --> 01:23:18,710
But that's it.

975
01:23:18,843 --> 01:23:20,979
Okay? Are we good?

976
01:23:22,314 --> 01:23:24,316
How are you feeling today?

977
01:23:27,886 --> 01:23:29,321
Let me think, um...

978
01:23:30,222 --> 01:23:32,891
I'm pretty sure my
fiancé thinks I'm crazy.

979
01:23:34,260 --> 01:23:39,432
My sister has just
totally shut me out.

980
01:23:39,564 --> 01:23:41,133
And now

981
01:23:41,866 --> 01:23:43,402
my former therapist

982
01:23:43,536 --> 01:23:46,738
is making unannounced
house calls

983
01:23:46,871 --> 01:23:49,141
to ensure that I
am not a danger.

984
01:23:49,275 --> 01:23:53,145
So, other than that,
I'm really good.

985
01:24:02,854 --> 01:24:04,923
Should you get that?

986
01:24:10,162 --> 01:24:11,029
What?

987
01:24:11,163 --> 01:24:13,731
<i>Rose, it's Madeline.</i>

988
01:24:13,865 --> 01:24:16,768
<i>I've been trying your
mobile all morning.</i>

989
01:24:16,901 --> 01:24:19,904
<i>I'm very concerned about how
we left things yesterday.</i>

990
01:24:22,040 --> 01:24:25,344
<i>Rose? Are you there?</i> No.

991
01:24:30,615 --> 01:24:31,983
<i>Hello?</i>

992
01:24:32,717 --> 01:24:34,619
No. <i>Rose?</i>

993
01:24:35,321 --> 01:24:36,988
No. No.

994
01:24:37,123 --> 01:24:39,624
Almost time, Rose.

995
01:24:40,859 --> 01:24:42,827
What the fuck are you?

996
01:24:46,332 --> 01:24:47,399
Ple... Please.

997
01:24:51,203 --> 01:24:52,338
No, no.

998
01:24:53,239 --> 01:24:55,107
No. No, no.

999
01:25:01,213 --> 01:25:02,414
No.

1000
01:26:12,484 --> 01:26:14,153
Hey, Dr. Cotter.

1001
01:26:14,286 --> 01:26:16,754
Aren't you supposed
to be on leave?

1002
01:26:16,888 --> 01:26:19,425
Just grabbing something
from my office.

1003
01:26:58,930 --> 01:27:01,100
Carl. Hi.

1004
01:27:04,969 --> 01:27:06,538
No. No. It's okay.

1005
01:27:06,672 --> 01:27:08,073
No, no, no.

1006
01:27:08,207 --> 01:27:09,941
It's okay. Oh, God.

1007
01:27:10,075 --> 01:27:12,077
No, no. Oh, no, no, no.

1008
01:27:12,211 --> 01:27:14,513
Shh. Shh. Just calm
down. No! No, no!

1009
01:27:14,647 --> 01:27:17,616
No! No! Shh! Shut the fuck up.

1010
01:27:19,084 --> 01:27:20,686
Just calm down, okay? Okay.

1011
01:27:20,818 --> 01:27:22,187
Rose.

1012
01:27:22,954 --> 01:27:24,256
What are you doing here?

1013
01:27:27,693 --> 01:27:29,261
I don't know.

1014
01:27:31,063 --> 01:27:33,299
Rose, you can't be
around patients.

1015
01:28:05,863 --> 01:28:07,566
Fuck! Rose!

1016
01:28:27,686 --> 01:28:30,522
Fuck!

1017
01:28:45,304 --> 01:28:47,373
Rose, what are you doing here?

1018
01:28:47,972 --> 01:28:49,408
Nothing.

1019
01:28:50,376 --> 01:28:51,976
I don't... I don't know.

1020
01:28:52,111 --> 01:28:54,813
I don't know why. I, uh...

1021
01:28:54,946 --> 01:28:57,483
Why don't we go inside
together and we can just talk?

1022
01:28:57,616 --> 01:28:58,916
No! It's...

1023
01:28:59,050 --> 01:29:00,419
It's not safe.

1024
01:29:00,552 --> 01:29:02,688
Rose, I don't think you
should be alone right now.

1025
01:29:02,821 --> 01:29:04,490
I need... I need to be alone.

1026
01:29:06,492 --> 01:29:08,893
I need to be... I
need to be alone.

1027
01:29:11,028 --> 01:29:13,565
I'm sorry. I'm
sorry. I have to go.

1028
01:29:15,501 --> 01:29:17,803
Rose, I don't think you
should go anywhere, okay?

1029
01:29:17,935 --> 01:29:20,672
You just relax, I'm gonna
make a phone call, all right?

1030
01:29:22,341 --> 01:29:23,809
Rose. Rose, don't go anywhere.

1031
01:29:23,941 --> 01:29:25,210
Wait. Rose, please.

1032
01:29:25,344 --> 01:29:27,246
Please don't go anywhere,
okay? Just hang...

1033
01:29:27,379 --> 01:29:29,947
Rose. Rose, wait! Rose!

1034
01:29:55,674 --> 01:29:58,610
Joel. <i>Rose, I saw a
police APB go out for you</i>

1035
01:29:58,744 --> 01:30:00,779
<i>that says you're dangerous.
What the fuck happened?</i>

1036
01:30:00,913 --> 01:30:02,113
I know what I
need to do. <i>What?</i>

1037
01:30:02,147 --> 01:30:05,049
This thing, it needs
all of its victims

1038
01:30:05,184 --> 01:30:06,685
to pass it on in
order to survive,

1039
01:30:06,819 --> 01:30:09,954
but if there's no one else
around, it has no way to pass.

1040
01:30:10,088 --> 01:30:11,356
As long as I'm alone,

1041
01:30:11,490 --> 01:30:13,091
I can deprive it
of what it needs.

1042
01:30:13,225 --> 01:30:14,660
<i>That doesn't make any sense.</i>

1043
01:30:14,793 --> 01:30:17,028
<i>Your plan is just to
avoid people forever?</i>

1044
01:30:17,162 --> 01:30:20,098
I am not gonna
keep running, okay?

1045
01:30:20,766 --> 01:30:22,134
I've got to face it.

1046
01:30:22,267 --> 01:30:24,603
<i>Okay, Rose, I'm coming to
you. Just tell me where...</i>

1047
01:33:54,813 --> 01:33:56,314
Rose.

1048
01:34:00,686 --> 01:34:01,887
Baby...

1049
01:34:07,126 --> 01:34:09,361
Help me, please.

1050
01:34:13,132 --> 01:34:15,600
Mommy made a mistake.

1051
01:34:22,307 --> 01:34:23,975
Get the phone.

1052
01:34:25,178 --> 01:34:26,945
Call for help.

1053
01:34:37,190 --> 01:34:39,257
Rose!

1054
01:38:50,976 --> 01:38:53,478
Rose.

1055
01:38:58,783 --> 01:39:00,252
It's okay, baby.

1056
01:39:01,052 --> 01:39:02,254
Come here.

1057
01:39:13,565 --> 01:39:17,203
I am so sorry.

1058
01:39:19,671 --> 01:39:21,840
I... I haven't been a good mom.

1059
01:39:24,876 --> 01:39:29,814
I want to be. I
really try to be.

1060
01:39:29,948 --> 01:39:36,155
But sometimes everything
is just too much.

1061
01:39:37,323 --> 01:39:41,093
There is something
terrible inside of me.

1062
01:39:41,893 --> 01:39:45,730
I hate myself.
Stop. Stop. Stop.

1063
01:39:46,298 --> 01:39:47,866
Are you ashamed of me?

1064
01:39:49,201 --> 01:39:50,236
No.

1065
01:39:50,835 --> 01:39:52,670
Then why did you let me die?

1066
01:39:56,375 --> 01:39:58,710
Why didn't you save
me? It's not my fault.

1067
01:39:58,843 --> 01:40:01,613
You could have called
for help. Stop. Stop it.

1068
01:40:01,746 --> 01:40:03,382
But you didn't. Stop it.

1069
01:40:03,516 --> 01:40:06,551
You wished that I would die.
Because I was afraid of you!

1070
01:40:06,684 --> 01:40:09,554
I was ten years old

1071
01:40:10,555 --> 01:40:12,891
and you were a monster.

1072
01:40:15,227 --> 01:40:20,299
And I know that it's not
fair. You... You needed help.

1073
01:40:21,900 --> 01:40:23,568
But I couldn't.

1074
01:40:28,374 --> 01:40:30,575
And I have carried that guilt

1075
01:40:31,643 --> 01:40:34,946
for my entire life.

1076
01:40:38,150 --> 01:40:41,886
And I... I have to let it go.

1077
01:40:43,855 --> 01:40:45,790
I ha... I have to let it go.

1078
01:40:52,531 --> 01:40:54,166
This is not real.

1079
01:40:55,067 --> 01:40:56,734
But Rose,

1080
01:40:56,868 --> 01:41:01,107
your mind makes it real.

1081
01:41:05,411 --> 01:41:06,811
What are you?

1082
01:41:07,879 --> 01:41:09,981
Why are you doing this to me?

1083
01:41:10,648 --> 01:41:12,318
Because your mind...

1084
01:41:13,051 --> 01:41:15,687
is so inviting.

1085
01:42:06,272 --> 01:42:10,008
You can't escape
your mind, Rose.

1086
01:42:17,583 --> 01:42:18,683
It's...

1087
01:42:19,784 --> 01:42:22,820
It's my mind.

1088
01:42:29,994 --> 01:42:31,930
You can't escape it either.

1089
01:42:47,413 --> 01:42:49,215
Rose!

1090
01:42:52,084 --> 01:42:53,751
Rose!

1091
01:44:17,035 --> 01:44:19,071
Holy shit.

1092
01:44:21,573 --> 01:44:22,974
Are you okay?

1093
01:44:23,108 --> 01:44:25,943
Can I just come in for
a sec? Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

1094
01:44:31,916 --> 01:44:33,419
Where have you been?

1095
01:44:37,889 --> 01:44:39,857
I'm sorry.

1096
01:44:41,327 --> 01:44:47,132
I'm sorry for dragging you
into my whole fucked-up mess.

1097
01:44:49,501 --> 01:44:51,035
For most of my life,

1098
01:44:51,170 --> 01:44:57,443
I've been afraid of letting
people get too close,

1099
01:44:58,310 --> 01:45:00,912
because I was afraid of...

1100
01:45:03,615 --> 01:45:06,285
what they might see
if they really looked.

1101
01:45:06,418 --> 01:45:11,557
And so I... I put walls up, and
I kept people at a distance.

1102
01:45:14,593 --> 01:45:15,993
And then...

1103
01:45:19,431 --> 01:45:20,733
I met you,

1104
01:45:20,865 --> 01:45:24,703
and I could feel those
walls coming down.

1105
01:45:24,837 --> 01:45:28,005
And it scared the
shit out of me.

1106
01:45:30,809 --> 01:45:32,244
And so...

1107
01:45:33,245 --> 01:45:40,017
I was selfish, and that
was not fair to you.

1108
01:45:41,620 --> 01:45:45,124
And I am so, so sorry.

1109
01:45:46,425 --> 01:45:51,028
And I'm... I'm being selfish
again by even asking,

1110
01:45:51,163 --> 01:45:52,364
but do you think that...

1111
01:45:52,498 --> 01:45:55,601
That I could stay
here and just...

1112
01:45:57,902 --> 01:45:59,371
just sleep?

1113
01:46:02,574 --> 01:46:03,975
Could you...

1114
01:46:05,411 --> 01:46:08,313
stay with me while I sleep?

1115
01:46:11,850 --> 01:46:12,950
Please.

1116
01:46:14,420 --> 01:46:16,655
Yeah, of course
I'll stay with you.

1117
01:46:24,797 --> 01:46:26,665
I'll stay with you forever.

1118
01:46:33,272 --> 01:46:34,373
No.

1119
01:46:41,480 --> 01:46:42,681
No.

1120
01:46:43,816 --> 01:46:45,184
No, no, no, no.

1121
01:46:46,017 --> 01:46:47,017
No, no.

1122
01:47:01,934 --> 01:47:03,168
No.

1123
01:47:27,426 --> 01:47:29,528
Rose.

1124
01:47:32,631 --> 01:47:35,267
No, no, no!

1125
01:47:42,941 --> 01:47:44,776
Rose! No.

1126
01:47:44,910 --> 01:47:47,044
Rose, open the door!

1127
01:47:48,614 --> 01:47:51,783
Open the door.

1128
01:47:53,452 --> 01:47:54,720
Rose!

1129
01:48:04,863 --> 01:48:07,666
No!

1130
01:48:08,367 --> 01:48:11,370
No! Fuck. Uh...

1131
01:48:11,503 --> 01:48:13,272
Hold on. I'm coming!

1132
01:48:13,405 --> 01:48:16,040
No!

1133
01:48:19,177 --> 01:48:20,579
Rose!

1134
01:48:23,081 --> 01:48:25,651
No!

1135
01:49:07,192 --> 01:49:08,594
Rose.

1136
01:49:42,861 --> 01:49:44,196
Rose?

1137
01:49:50,268 --> 01:49:51,370
Rose?
