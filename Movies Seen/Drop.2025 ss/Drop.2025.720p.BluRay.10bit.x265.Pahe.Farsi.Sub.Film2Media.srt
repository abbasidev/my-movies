1059

your purse fell on the ground.

1061
00:59:17,892 --> 00:59:20,561
-Henry, I, uh...
-You're lying to me.

1062
00:59:23,532 --> 00:59:24,865

someone in the restaurant?

1067

I just want to help.

1081

Why did you message me?

1082

I'm a widow with a kid.

1083

1084

1085

1086
01:00:42,443 --> 01:00:44,579

1087
01:00:44,613 --> 01:00:46,780
And, uh...

1088
01:00:46,881 --> 01:00:49,984
I was really close
to deleting my profile.

1089
01:00:50,084 --> 01:00:52,419
I feel like
everybody's trying to present

1090
01:00:52,554 --> 01:00:55,222
this version of themselves
that they're not.

1091
01:00:55,322 --> 01:00:58,259
A version that they think
other people want to see.

1092
01:00:59,528 --> 01:01:01,729
And then I saw you.

1093
01:01:02,496 --> 01:01:04,431
And I didn't see any of that.

1094
01:01:06,700 --> 01:01:09,003
You just seemed kind.

1095
01:01:11,238 --> 01:01:12,907
Genuine.

1096
01:01:14,308 --> 01:01:16,076
No pretense. Just a good mom.

1097
01:01:19,980 --> 01:01:21,215
I'm not.

1098
01:01:25,753 --> 01:01:27,622
I stayed in
an abusive relationship

1099
01:01:27,721 --> 01:01:29,690
even after Toby was born.

1100
01:01:30,659 --> 01:01:32,893
And he was really little...

1101
01:01:36,330 --> 01:01:38,832
...but he saw things that, um...

1102
01:01:41,902 --> 01:01:44,772
I mean, no child
should ever see that.

1103
01:01:49,710 --> 01:01:51,478
Well, you know what?

1104
01:01:51,580 --> 01:01:52,913
You got out.

1105
01:01:54,882 --> 01:01:56,518
That's all that matters.

1106
01:01:56,618 --> 01:01:58,852
I didn't.

(sniffles)

1108
01:02:02,591 --> 01:02:04,124
I never got out.

1109
01:02:05,492 --> 01:02:09,997
I'm still stuck in that room.

1110
01:02:11,332 --> 01:02:15,736
The night that I watched Blake
almost kill my s-son.

1111
01:02:18,973 --> 01:02:21,676
(crying):
And I just...

1112
01:02:21,775 --> 01:02:23,511
(sobbing)

1113
01:02:26,548 --> 01:02:28,749
I just sat there.

1114
01:02:32,486 --> 01:02:34,855
I did nothing.

1115
01:02:38,826 --> 01:02:41,428
And that's the kind
of mother I am.

(sighs)

1119
01:02:50,904 --> 01:02:54,576
I found myself in a,
in a pretty messed-up situation

1120
01:02:54,676 --> 01:02:57,845
not long ago, and somebody...

1121
01:02:57,945 --> 01:02:59,213
somebody I really trusted

1122
01:02:59,346 --> 01:03:02,316
ended up being
somebody totally different.

1123
01:03:04,418 --> 01:03:06,453
And for a long time...

1124
01:03:08,757 --> 01:03:10,291
...people were getting hurt.

1125
01:03:11,392 --> 01:03:14,928
Really good people were
getting hurt, and I...

1126
01:03:17,231 --> 01:03:19,333
I stayed silent
and I didn't say anything,

1127
01:03:19,433 --> 01:03:20,434
and then I finally did.

1128
01:03:20,501 --> 01:03:21,736
And I tried to do
the right thing,

1129
01:03:21,869 --> 01:03:23,971
whatever I thought
the right thing was,

1130
01:03:24,071 --> 01:03:26,940
whatever that is, and, uh...

1131
01:03:30,377 --> 01:03:32,681
...I still found myself feeling
guilty about it, you know?

1132
01:03:32,781 --> 01:03:35,249
And I know I didn't do
anything wrong.

1133
01:03:35,316 --> 01:03:38,185
You know, I think
that's what abusive people do.

1134
01:03:38,285 --> 01:03:40,354
They make us feel...

1135
01:03:41,723 --> 01:03:43,157
(sighs softly)

1136
01:03:44,491 --> 01:03:47,961

and they make us feel crazy.

(door opens)

1584
01:28:03,985 --> 01:28:05,285
(laughs) Too soon?

1585
01:28:05,318 --> 01:28:07,555
-Bitch, yes.
-(Jen laughs)

1586
01:28:07,655 --> 01:28:08,790
Unbelievable.

1587
01:28:08,856 --> 01:28:12,059
Hey, Henry.
I'm the sister down the hall.

1588
01:28:12,126 --> 01:28:13,828
Nice to meet you,
sister down the hall.

1589
01:28:13,928 --> 01:28:15,263
You got him some food?

1590
01:28:16,063 --> 01:28:19,567
-But you know I got shot, too.
-Do you want to get shot twice?

1591
01:28:20,333 --> 01:28:23,171
Okay. (chuckles)

1592
01:28:23,671 --> 01:28:25,606
-I'll go.
-See you later.

1593
01:28:25,706 --> 01:28:27,742
-Have fun.
-Thanks for stopping by, Jen.

1594
01:28:27,909 --> 01:28:28,910
JEN:
Save me some fries.

1595
01:28:29,043 --> 01:28:30,377
You know, she's really nice.

1596
01:28:30,477 --> 01:28:33,014
I think she's in
the wrong kind of hospital.

1597
01:28:33,080 --> 01:28:35,382
(both chuckle)

1598
01:28:36,250 --> 01:28:38,786
So, that was a...

1599
01:28:38,853 --> 01:28:40,922
-pretty hardcore first date.
-(laughing)

1600
01:28:42,924 --> 01:28:45,660
Oh, my God, there were
so many moments where

1601
01:28:45,760 --> 01:28:47,995
I was just thinking, "What is
this guy still doing here?"

1602
01:28:48,129 --> 01:28:50,731
You must have thought
that I was a crazy person.

1603
01:28:53,167 --> 01:28:55,236
You saved my life.

1604
01:28:55,269 --> 01:28:57,171
I don't even know
what to say to you.

1605
01:28:57,271 --> 01:28:59,574
Say you'll brave
a second date with me.

1606
01:28:59,674 --> 01:29:03,544
I would love to go
on a second date with you.

1607
01:29:03,678 --> 01:29:06,047
-(chuckles)
-What'd you have in mind?

1608
01:29:06,147 --> 01:29:08,249
(sighs):
I don't know.

1609
01:29:08,348 --> 01:29:12,587
Well, I was thinking
something really...

1610
01:29:12,753 --> 01:29:14,789
really...

1611
01:29:14,856 --> 01:29:15,890
boring.

1612
01:29:15,990 --> 01:29:18,226
-Oh. Yeah.
-(laughing)

1613
01:29:18,326 --> 01:29:20,460
(laughing):
That sounds great.

1614
01:29:21,461 --> 01:29:24,098
-How do milkshakes sound?
-Oh, pretty damn good to me.

1615
01:29:24,232 --> 01:29:25,432
-Yeah?
-What are we working with?

1616
01:29:25,533 --> 01:29:26,968
Okay, I got one of each.

1617
01:29:27,068 --> 01:29:29,436
So, are you a chocolate girl
or a strawberry girl?

1618
01:29:29,537 --> 01:29:31,471
Oh, I'm a strawberry girl.

1619
01:29:31,572 --> 01:29:33,074
-That's this one.
-Oh, great.
