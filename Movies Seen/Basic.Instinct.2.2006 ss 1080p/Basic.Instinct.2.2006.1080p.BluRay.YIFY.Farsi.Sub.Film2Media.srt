1
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:44,147
Guess what.

2
00:01:44,397 --> 00:01:45,982
What?

3
00:01:47,358 --> 00:01:49,152
I can't move.

4
00:01:50,487 --> 00:01:54,407
Yeah, well, you don't have to.
You're in a car.

5
00:02:00,246 --> 00:02:02,207
Am I driving?

6
00:02:03,833 --> 00:02:05,376
Like a pro.

7
00:03:55,904 --> 00:03:59,032
Come on, wake up, you fuck.
Come on.

8
00:05:07,266 --> 00:05:09,519
Did you try to help him get free?

9
00:05:11,562 --> 00:05:13,147
Briefly.

10
00:05:13,398 --> 00:05:14,774
Briefly?

11
00:05:15,024 --> 00:05:20,071
When it came down to it, my life
was more important to me than his.

12
00:05:21,864 --> 00:05:23,533
Selfish, huh?

13
00:05:28,871 --> 00:05:31,124
We found these...

14
00:05:33,292 --> 00:05:36,421
in your Spider.

15
00:05:36,671 --> 00:05:39,590
Actually, I don't drive a Spider
anymore.

16
00:05:39,841 --> 00:05:42,135
Now I have a C8 Laviolette.

17
00:05:42,385 --> 00:05:44,429
It's lighter, faster...

18
00:05:44,679 --> 00:05:46,514
swims better.

19
00:06:08,953 --> 00:06:10,288
Right.

20
00:06:10,538 --> 00:06:13,166
These three contain traces
of ketamine...

21
00:06:13,416 --> 00:06:16,252
the same as we found in your blood
and his.

22
00:06:16,502 --> 00:06:21,632
- Tu

23
00:06:21,883 --> 00:06:24,510
which we only found in him.

24
00:06:25,094 --> 00:06:27,764
Must've been something
he took at the party.

25
00:06:28,014 --> 00:06:30,475
No. DTC is not a party drug.

26
00:06:30,725 --> 00:06:34,020
Along with the other stuff in his blood,
it paralyzed his lungs.

27
00:06:34,395 --> 00:06:36,481
Kevin Franks did not drown.

28
00:06:36,731 --> 00:06:41,527
He had already stopped breathing
by the time you drove off the road.

29
00:06:41,778 --> 00:06:43,821
He was breathing
when we went off the road.

30
00:06:44,072 --> 00:06:45,072
How do you know?

31
00:06:45,281 --> 00:06:46,616
He was making me come.

32
00:06:48,034 --> 00:06:52,163
What? You were having sex
at 100 miles an hour?

33
00:06:52,538 --> 00:06:56,292
Hundred and ten.
I must've hit a pothole.

34
00:06:57,585 --> 00:06:59,837
Your friend, Dickie Pep...

35
00:07:00,129 --> 00:07:04,675
Thu

36
00:07:04,926 --> 00:07:08,596
I don't know any Dickie Pep,
but he's lying.

37
00:07:08,846 --> 00:07:09,847
Or you are.

38
00:07:10,139 --> 00:07:11,139
Why would he lie?

39
00:07:11,307 --> 00:07:14,769
You got him on some other charge
and he's trying to deal his way out.

40
00:07:15,019 --> 00:07:16,312
If he even exists.

41
00:07:19,816 --> 00:07:23,152
You don't seem too upset by what's
happened.

42
00:07:23,402 --> 00:07:25,613
Of course I am, I'm traumatized.

43
00:07:27,949 --> 00:07:30,535
Who knows if I'll ever come again?

44
00:07:34,038 --> 00:07:35,998
I want that cunt in jail.

45
00:07:36,249 --> 00:07:38,000
We haven't got a case, Roy.

46
00:07:38,251 --> 00:07:42,255
Well, just fucking make one. Please.

47
00:07:42,505 --> 00:07:45,049
They'll order a psychiatric for bail.

48
00:07:45,299 --> 00:07:48,094
I'll make sure we get somebody
good and tough.

49
00:08:11,784 --> 00:08:16,247
Dr. Glass. I'm Henry Rose,
Miss Tramell's solicitor.

50
00:08:16,497 --> 00:08:18,666
This is Catherine Tramell.

51
00:08:19,208 --> 00:08:21,878
I shall be present during
the evaluation.

52
00:08:22,545 --> 00:08:24,255
Well, that's fine by me.

53
00:08:24,505 --> 00:08:28,801
I'll be asking fairly personal questions.
If she doesn't mind your presence...

54
00:08:29,051 --> 00:08:32,305
My client understands and agrees
I should be present for...

55
00:08:32,555 --> 00:08:35,558
Maybe Dr. Glass is right
and we should be alone for this.

56
00:08:35,808 --> 00:08:38,686
I strongly advise you
not to contemplate having...

57
00:08:38,936 --> 00:08:41,522
So is this where
we're going to do it?

58
00:08:57,038 --> 00:09:00,124
Mr. Rose told you the purpose
of this evaluation.

59
00:09:00,374 --> 00:09:02,668
I'm applying for bail in a murder case.

60
00:09:02,919 --> 00:09:06,714
The Crown wants to know
if I'm a danger to myself or others.

61
00:09:06,964 --> 00:09:09,967
You're the Crown's shrink,
so you'll say I'm dangerous.

62
00:09:10,218 --> 00:09:13,262
My shrink will say I'm not,
and the judge will flip a coin.

63
00:09:14,722 --> 00:09:18,017
Anything you tell me can be quoted
verbatim in testimony...

64
00:09:18,267 --> 00:09:19,518
and can affect your case.

65
00:09:19,769 --> 00:09:21,354
You can quote me all you want.

66
00:09:21,604 --> 00:09:22,604
Thank you.

67
00:09:25,066 --> 00:09:27,276
Well, I see that you're a writer.

68
00:09:28,736 --> 00:09:30,279
What do you write about?

69
00:09:30,529 --> 00:09:33,241
Murder, sex, violence.

70
00:09:33,491 --> 00:09:35,660
Do you ever write about yourself?

71
00:09:35,910 --> 00:09:37,870
Not into autobiography.

72
00:09:38,079 --> 00:09:39,372
Really? Why not?

73
00:09:39,622 --> 00:09:43,834
Maybe I like to just sit back and get
other people to reveal themselves.

74
00:09:46,671 --> 00:09:49,465
For instance,
you look a little divorced.

75
00:09:50,007 --> 00:09:52,093
What makes you think I'm divorced?

76
00:09:52,343 --> 00:09:54,387
The ring line hasn't faded.

77
00:09:57,598 --> 00:09:59,058
You're very observant.

78
00:09:59,308 --> 00:10:01,185
Yeah, but am I wrong?

79
00:10:01,477 --> 00:10:03,562
Would it bother you
if you were wrong?

80
00:10:03,813 --> 00:10:05,898
Would it bother you if I was right?

81
00:10:11,070 --> 00:10:14,031
Tell me something you're afraid of.

82
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:20,204
Boredom.

83
00:10:20,454 --> 00:10:22,248
Is that why you like to take risks?

84
00:10:23,291 --> 00:10:25,543
I do like to take risks.

85
00:10:25,793 --> 00:10:29,005
Like taking drugs and having sex
in a speeding car?

86
00:10:29,255 --> 00:10:32,216
Like talking to me
without having your lawyer present?

87
00:10:33,718 --> 00:10:36,137
Actually, that was your idea.

88
00:10:36,387 --> 00:10:40,558
Like being on trial for murder? That's
risky. You could end up in prison.

89
00:10:40,808 --> 00:10:41,809
Not if I'm innocent.

90
00:10:42,059 --> 00:10:44,437
Innocent people end up in prison
all the time.

91
00:10:44,687 --> 00:10:48,232
Not rich, innocent people who are
represented by Henry Rose.

92
00:10:48,482 --> 00:10:51,694
In that case, it isn't really exciting
unless you're guilty.

93
00:10:55,281 --> 00:10:59,869
Oh, I bet you like to take risks,
don't you, Dr. Glass?

94
00:11:00,119 --> 00:11:02,580
But I'm not the one who's on trial
for murder.

95
00:11:02,830 --> 00:11:04,248
Not yet.

96
00:11:10,796 --> 00:11:13,341
Sorry, you're not allowed
to smoke in here.

97
00:11:21,182 --> 00:11:23,559
You know what I like about you?

98
00:11:23,809 --> 00:11:26,562
You enjoy being in control.

99
00:11:32,735 --> 00:11:34,195
Like me.

100
00:11:48,876 --> 00:11:51,170
Sorry, sir. Can't let you through here.

101
00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:56,675
Well, I would say extremely intelligent.
Gifted, accomplished.

102
00:11:56,884 --> 00:11:58,177
Yet inside, I believe...

103
00:11:58,427 --> 00:12:01,972
she vacillates between
a feeling of godlike omnipotence...

104
00:12:02,223 --> 00:12:04,975
and a sense
that she simply doesn't exist...

105
00:12:05,226 --> 00:12:07,395
which, of course, is intolerable.

106
00:12:07,645 --> 00:12:11,440
Do you consider Miss Tramell to be
mentally impaired?

107
00:12:11,649 --> 00:12:14,568
Not by legal definition, no. Not at all.

108
00:12:14,819 --> 00:12:19,198
If released, is she likely
to commit a violent crime?

109
00:12:20,616 --> 00:12:24,370
I believe her behavior is driven
by what we call a risk addiction.

110
00:12:24,954 --> 00:12:28,290
A compulsive need to prove to herself
that she can take risks...

111
00:12:28,541 --> 00:12:30,501
and survive dangers others can't.

112
00:12:30,751 --> 00:12:35,673
Especially the subsequent encounters
with the police or the powers that be.

113
00:12:36,173 --> 00:12:37,675
Why would a person do that?

114
00:12:37,925 --> 00:12:41,595
The greater the risk, the greater the
proof of her omnipotence.

115
00:12:42,138 --> 00:12:44,056
Her existence, really.

116
00:12:44,306 --> 00:12:47,810
When you say she has
a risk addiction...

117
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:50,479
is this condition likely to get
worse?

118
00:12:50,729 --> 00:12:52,148
All addiction is progressive.

119
00:12:52,398 --> 00:12:54,900
The addict always needs to take
greater risks.

120
00:12:55,192 --> 00:12:57,570
If other people are hurt or killed...

121
00:12:57,820 --> 00:13:01,157
as a result of her behavior,
that's not likely to stop her?

122
00:13:01,407 --> 00:13:03,868
I think the only thing
that'd stop her...

123
00:13:08,205 --> 00:13:11,542
I suspect the only limit for her
would be her own death.

124
00:13:14,753 --> 00:13:17,214
Then she is a danger to herself.

125
00:13:18,799 --> 00:13:20,551
Yes, I believe she is.

126
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:30,478
Nice work, Michael. Well done.

127
00:13:32,313 --> 00:13:35,566
Dr. Glass, did Catherine Tramell
kill Kevin Franks?

128
00:13:35,816 --> 00:13:38,194
No, I can't make any comment, sorry.

129
00:13:38,444 --> 00:13:40,779
Can you please tell us about the bail?

130
00:13:42,781 --> 00:13:47,578
Dr. Michael Glass. What a big thing
you are all of a sudden.

131
00:13:47,828 --> 00:13:52,291
What are you doing here, Adam?
Don't say you're writing about Tramell.

132
00:13:52,541 --> 00:13:55,252
A sexy, omnipotent killer
with a Random House contract.

133
00:13:55,503 --> 00:13:56,587
Why would I write that?

134
00:13:56,837 --> 00:13:58,380
You don't know she's a killer.

135
00:13:58,631 --> 00:14:02,176
No, but I hope she is, though.
I mean, I pray to God she is.

136
00:14:02,426 --> 00:14:05,429
By the way, I hear you were
brilliant in there.

137
00:14:05,679 --> 00:14:08,807
You're so lucid sometimes,
it's just disgusting.

138
00:14:09,058 --> 00:14:11,185
You thought about daytime television?

139
00:14:11,435 --> 00:14:14,897
Denise always says you were born
for the small screen.

140
00:14:15,147 --> 00:14:17,816
And how is my wife these days?
Having fun?

141
00:14:18,067 --> 00:14:21,362
Ex-wife, Michael. Ex-wife.

142
00:14:21,612 --> 00:14:23,906
While we're chatting about killers...

143
00:14:24,156 --> 00:14:27,243
is there any chance of talking about
George Cheslav?

144
00:14:27,493 --> 00:14:29,328
Who told you about Cheslav?

145
00:14:29,578 --> 00:14:30,788
Denise?

146
00:14:31,038 --> 00:14:34,250
That's got to be any shrink's worst
nightmare.

147
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:37,461
A patient in your care
suddenly runs amok...

148
00:14:37,711 --> 00:14:39,547
beats his girlfriend to death
with a brick.

149
00:14:39,797 --> 00:14:42,424
That was seven years ago,
why talk about it now?

150
00:14:42,675 --> 00:14:45,636
Not quite seven, actually.
Seven in July.

151
00:14:45,886 --> 00:14:50,808
But you talked to him twice a week.
He never indicated he'd harm the girl?

152
00:14:51,058 --> 00:14:53,435
I don't talk about my patients.

153
00:14:53,686 --> 00:14:57,356
Cheslav's dead. Can't you talk
about them when they're dead?

154
00:14:57,606 --> 00:15:00,276
No, not even when they're dead.

155
00:15:28,554 --> 00:15:30,264
Michael, what are you doing here?

156
00:15:30,514 --> 00:15:33,809
What did you tell Adam Towers
about George Cheslav?

157
00:15:34,059 --> 00:15:35,436
Nothing.

158
00:15:36,937 --> 00:15:38,856
Can you give us a minute?

159
00:15:40,441 --> 00:15:41,984
He already knew.

160
00:15:44,945 --> 00:15:48,490
Really? Because he said you told him.

161
00:15:48,741 --> 00:15:50,784
No, all I said was...

162
00:15:51,035 --> 00:15:54,413
If he writes about that, if he puts it
on his magazine cover...

163
00:15:54,663 --> 00:15:56,624
He won't. You're just being paranoid.

164
00:15:56,874 --> 00:15:58,292
You didn't do anything wrong.

165
00:15:58,542 --> 00:16:02,796
Right. I didn't. I was treating a patient
that killed his pregnant girlfriend.

166
00:16:03,047 --> 00:16:05,883
End of story.
You make sure he gets that.

167
00:16:06,133 --> 00:16:07,468
Don't worry.

168
00:16:15,476 --> 00:16:18,020
I'm up for the Douglas Chair
at the university.

169
00:16:18,270 --> 00:16:22,149
You know what that means to me.
Do you think this is going to help?

170
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:24,109
I can't tell Adam what to write.

171
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:25,360
Why not?

172
00:16:25,527 --> 00:16:26,527
Don't be stupid.

173
00:16:26,695 --> 00:16:30,574
I think you're entitled to since you've
been fucking him for over a year.

174
00:16:30,824 --> 00:16:33,744
Do you think I didn't know
when it started?

175
00:16:33,952 --> 00:16:37,456
It's a pity you never asked yourself
why it started.

176
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:49,635
How was the court case
with the mystery writer?

177
00:16:49,927 --> 00:16:51,428
I hear she looks fabulous.

178
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:55,516
Also very intelligent.
Pathological liar. Narcissistic.

179
00:16:55,724 --> 00:16:58,018
Seductive, manipulative.

180
00:16:58,227 --> 00:17:00,354
Do you think she killed the footballer?

181
00:17:00,604 --> 00:17:01,604
I have no idea.

182
00:17:01,772 --> 00:17:04,733
Everything she does is so perfectly
composed.

183
00:17:04,983 --> 00:17:07,403
It's designed to confuse
or confound you.

184
00:17:07,653 --> 00:17:11,740
You never know what's truth
and what isn't. She's brilliant, really.

185
00:17:11,949 --> 00:17:13,951
The masked psychotic. Your favorite.

186
00:17:14,201 --> 00:17:17,621
I'm already working it into a paper:
"Risk Addiction and Omnipotence."

187
00:17:17,871 --> 00:17:19,123
You're writing another already?

188
00:17:19,373 --> 00:17:21,667
I'm writing two,
but this is the more interesting.

189
00:17:21,875 --> 00:17:23,502
I'll catch you up.

190
00:17:23,752 --> 00:17:25,003
Hello?

191
00:17:25,254 --> 00:17:28,799
Glass? It's Roy Washburn.
Are you near a television set?

192
00:17:29,049 --> 00:17:31,802
<i>If you'll be quiet, I'll make a
statement.</i>

193
00:17:32,052 --> 00:17:33,052
What happened?

194
00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:34,430
<i>The judge let her go.</i>

195
00:17:34,763 --> 00:17:35,763
Let her go? Why?

196
00:17:35,931 --> 00:17:38,183
<i>The guy who said
he sold her the D</i> TC...

197
00:17:38,434 --> 00:17:41,478
<i>the judge found out he'd perjured
himself in another case...</i>

198
00:17:41,729 --> 00:17:45,399
<i>and disqualified him as a witness.
But I'll make you a bet.</i>

199
00:17:45,649 --> 00:17:46,649
What's that?

200
00:17:46,859 --> 00:17:48,110
<i>She'll do it again.</i>

201
00:17:48,318 --> 00:17:49,403
<i>And soon.</i>

202
00:17:49,653 --> 00:17:53,615
<i>Only this time
I will fucking nail the bitch.</i>

203
00:18:11,467 --> 00:18:15,721
So we've been considering those who
wish to control others...

204
00:18:15,929 --> 00:18:19,016
through their insecurity and their
narcissism.

205
00:18:19,266 --> 00:18:23,645
To study Nietzsche
psychobiographically may seem naive.

206
00:18:23,896 --> 00:18:26,273
Wasn't it Nietzsche's work itself,
which...

207
00:18:26,523 --> 00:18:29,526
through deconstructive and
post-structuralist readings...

208
00:18:29,777 --> 00:18:32,279
I F

209
00:18:36,742 --> 00:18:41,580
Paul Portman said he might go
to Tavistock. I'm thinking I might go.

210
00:18:41,830 --> 00:18:45,250
Just be patient.
Stay where you are for about a year.

211
00:18:45,501 --> 00:18:48,128
- But there's nothing holding me.
- Trust me.

212
00:18:48,378 --> 00:18:49,546
You know Dr. Gerst?

213
00:18:50,005 --> 00:18:51,673
Michael Glass.

214
00:18:51,924 --> 00:18:53,634
It's a pleasure.

215
00:18:54,009 --> 00:18:56,261
I saw your review of my book.

216
00:18:56,512 --> 00:19:00,140
You didn't understand what I was
saying about the analytic field.

217
00:19:00,390 --> 00:19:04,520
Towards the end you made one or two
interesting remarks.

218
00:19:04,770 --> 00:19:07,439
Maybe one of these days
we can discuss it.

219
00:19:07,898 --> 00:19:10,192
I'd be honored. Thank you very much.

220
00:19:12,444 --> 00:19:14,571
"One or two interesting remarks"?

221
00:19:14,822 --> 00:19:19,034
That was a compliment, Michelle.
Dr. Gerst was very impressed.

222
00:19:19,284 --> 00:19:22,579
And it appears that our Michael
has just been knighted.

223
00:19:23,831 --> 00:19:25,082
Cheers.

224
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,710
Congratulations.

225
00:20:05,873 --> 00:20:08,792
- Can I ask you a question?
- Sure.

226
00:20:09,877 --> 00:20:15,173
Every day I see you writing and I am
thinking, "What is he writing about?"

227
00:20:15,382 --> 00:20:17,342
Is it a novel?

228
00:20:18,051 --> 00:20:20,345
No, but there was a novelist in it.

229
00:20:20,596 --> 00:20:23,765
Really? who?

230
00:20:24,016 --> 00:20:27,269
I can't tell you that.
Otherwise I'd have to kill you.

231
00:20:30,522 --> 00:20:33,692
Must be someone famous, then.

232
00:20:48,415 --> 00:20:50,375
Excuse me. Dr. Glass?

233
00:20:50,626 --> 00:20:52,961
I'm Peter Ristedes.
Adam Towers' assistant.

234
00:20:53,420 --> 00:20:55,380
<i>Urbane magazine.</i>

235
00:20:57,674 --> 00:20:59,551
Mind if I join you?

236
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:04,348
Adam asked me to see if you'd give us
a quote for the article he's writing.

237
00:21:04,598 --> 00:21:06,516
I believe he mentioned it to you.

238
00:21:07,851 --> 00:21:10,854
He didn't seem to think
you'd want to talk to him.

239
00:21:17,945 --> 00:21:20,489
I'll take that as a "no comment," then?

240
00:21:37,881 --> 00:21:39,383
Dr. Glass?

241
00:21:42,344 --> 00:21:43,762
Miss Tramell.

242
00:21:45,305 --> 00:21:46,598
What are you doing here?

243
00:21:47,099 --> 00:21:48,976
I wanted to talk to you.

244
00:21:49,184 --> 00:21:50,978
About the evaluation.

245
00:21:52,229 --> 00:21:56,525
Some of the things you said,
I've been thinking about them a lot.

246
00:21:59,069 --> 00:22:01,321
I'm sorry you had to hear all that.

247
00:22:04,950 --> 00:22:06,243
Got a minute?

248
00:22:11,289 --> 00:22:12,666
Come through.

249
00:22:21,717 --> 00:22:26,972
What you said about me
being addicted to risk...

250
00:22:27,222 --> 00:22:30,350
about having to do more and more
dangerous things...

251
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:33,854
Well, after you said it...

252
00:22:34,438 --> 00:22:36,815
I realized I was...

253
00:22:37,065 --> 00:22:38,525
“.scared.

254
00:22:39,609 --> 00:22:41,319
What exactly scared you?

255
00:22:43,697 --> 00:22:48,035
For weeks before the accident
I was having the same...

256
00:22:49,369 --> 00:22:52,122
fantasy over and over again.

257
00:22:53,498 --> 00:22:55,542
I even wrote about it.

258
00:22:55,792 --> 00:23:00,881
The woman's driving in the car,
the man's making her come.

259
00:23:01,131 --> 00:23:04,843
She drives off the road,
the man's killed.

260
00:23:05,218 --> 00:23:08,597
I feel like maybe I made it all happen.

261
00:23:10,474 --> 00:23:12,309
That's why I'm here.

262
00:23:12,559 --> 00:23:15,395
Are you saying you'd like to
go into treatment?

263
00:23:18,398 --> 00:23:19,399
Yeah.

264
00:23:19,649 --> 00:23:22,027
Well, I think that's a very good idea.

265
00:23:23,403 --> 00:23:27,491
I wouldn't be able to treat you, but I'd
be happy to refer you to a colleague.

266
00:23:27,741 --> 00:23:28,992
Why can't you treat me?

267
00:23:29,201 --> 00:23:32,621
It's not advisable for a doctor who's
done a forensic evaluation...

268
00:23:32,913 --> 00:23:34,831
to then become that person's
therapist.

269
00:23:35,082 --> 00:23:36,082
Why not?

270
00:23:36,249 --> 00:23:40,587
Therapy requires a great deal of trust,
which is difficult for most people.

271
00:23:40,837 --> 00:23:43,507
It's best to start with a clean slate.

272
00:23:43,757 --> 00:23:46,218
You mean you don't trust me.

273
00:23:49,262 --> 00:23:53,016
What I said about you at the hearing
must have seemed very negative.

274
00:23:53,266 --> 00:23:55,102
I'm sure you've got feelings about that.

275
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:57,896
I'd be happy referring you
to another doctor.

276
00:23:58,355 --> 00:24:01,900
In

277
00:24:02,192 --> 00:24:03,902
You want to know the truth?

278
00:24:04,194 --> 00:24:08,824
The reason I agreed to the evaluation
was because I thought it would be fun.

279
00:24:09,074 --> 00:24:10,367
I never...

280
00:24:12,410 --> 00:24:14,913
I never talked to anyone who...

281
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:32,264
My patient's here.

282
00:24:38,937 --> 00:24:40,147
What do I owe you?

283
00:24:40,397 --> 00:24:42,357
You don't owe me anything.

284
00:24:42,607 --> 00:24:47,487
But if you'd like to call Dr. Gardosh,
I'm sure she can help you.

285
00:24:47,737 --> 00:24:49,698
I don't shop around.

286
00:24:49,948 --> 00:24:53,076
Like you said,
trust is very hard to come by.

287
00:24:54,786 --> 00:24:58,039
I was hoping I might find it with you.

288
00:25:01,668 --> 00:25:05,463
Listen, why don't we
schedule another meeting.

289
00:25:05,714 --> 00:25:09,259
And then we can talk about this
when we're not so rushed.

290
00:25:54,846 --> 00:25:58,225
You look different today. More relaxed.

291
00:25:58,683 --> 00:26:02,896
The more nervous I am,
the more relaxed people think I am.

292
00:26:04,022 --> 00:26:07,609
I wanted to talk about something you
brought up last Wednesday.

293
00:26:07,859 --> 00:26:09,402
You said before the accident...

294
00:26:09,694 --> 00:26:13,573
you had fantasies of sexual
excitement and driving off the road.

295
00:26:13,949 --> 00:26:16,451
Do you often have fantasies like that?

296
00:26:16,701 --> 00:26:18,495
I have fantasies all the time.

297
00:26:19,663 --> 00:26:23,416
Fantasies involving violence, death?

298
00:26:25,043 --> 00:26:26,544
People die in my novels.

299
00:26:26,795 --> 00:26:29,714
I have to think of new and interesting
ways to kill them.

300
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:34,302
What happens when
you don't take risks?

301
00:26:42,018 --> 00:26:45,814
I'm sorry, there's no smoking in here.
It's a rule.

302
00:26:46,064 --> 00:26:47,482
I don't like rules.

303
00:26:47,732 --> 00:26:50,068
I have some of them,
and that's one of them.

304
00:26:54,906 --> 00:26:57,117
After the hearing...

305
00:26:57,367 --> 00:27:01,371
<i>I was interviewed by a reporter
from Urbane magazine.</i>

306
00:27:04,874 --> 00:27:08,420
Adam Towers. He said he knew you.

307
00:27:08,670 --> 00:27:10,422
Slightly. Why?

308
00:27:12,465 --> 00:27:15,468
He told me about the Cheslav case.

309
00:27:15,719 --> 00:27:18,555
I was impressed by what you did.

310
00:27:18,805 --> 00:27:22,058
You knew Cheslav was dangerous.

311
00:27:22,309 --> 00:27:24,477
Still you protected him.

312
00:27:25,729 --> 00:27:28,189
You honored his confidentiality...

313
00:27:28,648 --> 00:27:31,359
even at risk to yourself.

314
00:27:32,902 --> 00:27:35,697
Do you think you made the right
decision?

315
00:27:35,947 --> 00:27:38,033
Or do you think you fucked up?

316
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:43,913
Given what I knew at the time,
I made the right decision.

317
00:27:46,333 --> 00:27:50,378
So you still believe in confidentiality.

318
00:27:50,837 --> 00:27:54,257
Within legal limits.
What exactly are you concerned with?

319
00:28:01,139 --> 00:28:05,310
If I told you
that I killed Kevin Franks...

320
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:08,188
would you report me to the police?

321
00:28:11,107 --> 00:28:12,442
No.

322
00:28:12,692 --> 00:28:16,946
Anything that happened in the past,
I wouldn't discuss outside this room.

323
00:28:19,699 --> 00:28:23,411
But if you told me you were going to
murder someone specifically...

324
00:28:23,661 --> 00:28:25,872
and I thought you were serious...

325
00:28:26,122 --> 00:28:28,500
then, yes, I'd go to the police.

326
00:28:29,667 --> 00:28:33,838
I might be manipulating you
to create risk for myself.

327
00:28:37,550 --> 00:28:40,261
Do you want to talk about
what happened to Kevin?

328
00:28:44,599 --> 00:28:46,226
No, not really.

329
00:28:46,476 --> 00:28:49,312
I was just checking your policy.

330
00:28:51,314 --> 00:28:53,358
So have you decided?

331
00:28:54,943 --> 00:28:57,570
About taking me on as a patient.

332
00:29:02,534 --> 00:29:05,245
<i>Shooter had an ex-wife,
a drinking problem...</i>

333
00:29:05,495 --> 00:29:09,416
<i>a drug problem, a complicated sex
problem he was barely aware of.</i>

334
00:29:09,666 --> 00:29:12,502
<i>And a tremendous amount of
free-floating rage.</i>

335
00:29:12,710 --> 00:29:16,673
<i>In short, he was a cop
and a very good one.</i>

336
00:29:16,923 --> 00:29:18,007
<i>On March 3rd...</i>

337
00:29:18,258 --> 00:29:20,718
<i>The woman knelt naked
at the foot of the bed.</i>

338
00:29:20,969 --> 00:29:23,179
<i>Her back to him, her head on a pillow.</i>

339
00:29:23,430 --> 00:29:27,725
<i>Shooter raked his fingers through her
blond hair and twisted it tight.</i>

340
00:29:27,934 --> 00:29:30,019
<i>She groaned, her breath catching...</i>

341
00:29:30,270 --> 00:29:34,441
<i>as he suddenly yanked her hair like
a rider pulling on a horse's mane.</i>

342
00:29:34,691 --> 00:29:39,320
<i>The veins on his arms bulged as
he roughly drew her onto him.</i>

343
00:29:41,489 --> 00:29:44,075
<i>Do you remember
that cop Washburn?</i>

344
00:29:44,492 --> 00:29:49,706
To him, the fact that I wasn't upset
about Kevin Franks...

345
00:29:49,956 --> 00:29:52,584
was proof that I must've killed him.

346
00:29:54,419 --> 00:29:57,464
Then, when I wouldn't break down...

347
00:29:57,714 --> 00:29:59,716
he hit on me.

348
00:30:01,676 --> 00:30:02,927
Hit on you?

349
00:30:03,178 --> 00:30:04,220
Yeah.

350
00:30:04,471 --> 00:30:07,807
He said that if I fucked him things
would go easier.

351
00:30:09,100 --> 00:30:11,978
Homicide cops
are usually smarter than that.

352
00:30:13,563 --> 00:30:17,358
I knew one once, in San Francisco.

353
00:30:19,068 --> 00:30:20,987
Nick Curran.

354
00:30:21,237 --> 00:30:23,198
They called him Shooter.

355
00:30:23,448 --> 00:30:26,743
We used to get in his car
and ride around...

356
00:30:26,951 --> 00:30:30,121
listening to 911 calls on his
scanner...

357
00:30:30,371 --> 00:30:32,081
then speed over.

358
00:30:32,332 --> 00:30:35,835
Have you ever been to a murder scene
right after it happened?

359
00:30:39,923 --> 00:30:42,258
The body's still warm.

360
00:30:43,635 --> 00:30:46,054
The watch is still ticking.

361
00:30:47,263 --> 00:30:49,265
You can smell the blood.

362
00:30:51,184 --> 00:30:53,937
We'd hang around
for a while and then...

363
00:30:54,187 --> 00:30:56,648
go have sex in Nick's car.

364
00:31:01,861 --> 00:31:03,780
Nick used to say:

365
00:31:03,988 --> 00:31:09,410
"Death is always there.
It's the only thing that's real."

366
00:31:09,661 --> 00:31:12,789
Except maybe sex sometimes.

367
00:31:13,039 --> 00:31:15,625
But only sometimes?

368
00:31:15,875 --> 00:31:17,585
Well...

369
00:31:17,919 --> 00:31:21,130
I fucked this guy last night.

370
00:31:21,381 --> 00:31:23,466
I fucked him for hours.

371
00:31:23,716 --> 00:31:26,427
You know,
we did everything to each other.

372
00:31:27,804 --> 00:31:33,059
The full screaming Masters
and Johnson's greatest hits.

373
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:39,023
But you know, a week from now,
I probably won't even remember him.

374
00:31:39,274 --> 00:31:43,069
But, if I was with him when he died...

375
00:31:45,697 --> 00:31:46,906
Now...

376
00:31:48,283 --> 00:31:53,204
I probably would never forget that.

377
00:31:55,290 --> 00:31:56,457
Would I?

378
00:31:58,167 --> 00:32:00,753
Were you ever with anyone
when they died?

379
00:32:05,133 --> 00:32:06,175
No.

380
00:32:08,136 --> 00:32:09,596
Christ.

381
00:32:14,809 --> 00:32:16,686
We still have 20 minutes left.

382
00:32:16,936 --> 00:32:19,022
I feel like a cigarette.

383
00:32:19,272 --> 00:32:20,898
See you tomorrow.

384
00:32:22,066 --> 00:32:23,318
<i>She just walked out?</i>

385
00:32:25,570 --> 00:32:26,613
How Lacanian.

386
00:32:26,863 --> 00:32:28,615
For her, time's a weapon.

387
00:32:28,865 --> 00:32:31,826
Everything's a weapon.
Everybody's an enemy.

388
00:32:32,952 --> 00:32:36,998
Do you think she made it up about
the policeman? Washburn?

389
00:32:37,248 --> 00:32:40,710
I don't know. It's so hard to believe
anything she says.

390
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:42,712
She's trying to seduce you.

391
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:44,922
They always try to seduce you.

392
00:32:45,173 --> 00:32:47,800
Yes, but this one's different, isn't it?

393
00:32:49,218 --> 00:32:51,971
I don't know. More fun maybe.

394
00:32:52,221 --> 00:32:54,182
Be careful, Michael.

395
00:32:57,060 --> 00:33:00,563
By the way, I got a call from that
reporter, Adam Towers.

396
00:33:01,981 --> 00:33:03,066
What did he want?

397
00:33:03,316 --> 00:33:06,903
I made everything sound boring.
I assured him he didn't have a story.

398
00:33:07,195 --> 00:33:09,864
If

399
00:33:10,114 --> 00:33:14,160
Gerst won't talk to a popular magazine
reporter. Are you kidding?

400
00:33:29,342 --> 00:33:31,260
Anyway, it was a successful paper.

401
00:33:31,511 --> 00:33:34,180
Published, on this occasion,
under sole authorship.

402
00:33:34,430 --> 00:33:36,057
Well, thank God for that.

403
00:33:36,307 --> 00:33:38,393
Speaking of God, is Gerst coming?

404
00:33:38,643 --> 00:33:40,561
We can only hope and pray.

405
00:33:40,812 --> 00:33:42,939
That he comes or he doesn't?

406
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:48,945
I'm going for a smoke. Don't talk about
anything interesting till I get back.

407
00:33:50,488 --> 00:33:52,031
How long have you lived here?

408
00:33:52,281 --> 00:33:55,827
About six years, something like that.
Seven.

409
00:34:06,129 --> 00:34:07,129
Hi, Dominic.

410
00:34:07,338 --> 00:34:08,464
Hi,

411
00:34:16,764 --> 00:34:17,764
Thank you.

412
00:34:20,768 --> 00:34:22,895
The beauty about
antisocial behavior...

413
00:34:23,146 --> 00:34:26,649
is that it takes you away from other
people, however briefly.

414
00:34:28,776 --> 00:34:30,445
You're not an analyst.

415
00:34:32,947 --> 00:34:34,282
I'm a writer.

416
00:34:34,532 --> 00:34:36,909
Really? What do you write about?

417
00:34:37,160 --> 00:34:41,164
Oh, the lurid, the sexual, the violent.

418
00:34:41,414 --> 00:34:43,040
The basic instincts.

419
00:34:44,125 --> 00:34:45,918
They're the most powerful,
aren't they?

420
00:34:58,389 --> 00:34:59,557
Milena.

421
00:34:59,807 --> 00:35:01,100
Oh, Michael.

422
00:35:01,309 --> 00:35:03,728
I'm sorry, I didn't ask your name.

423
00:35:03,936 --> 00:35:07,106
Catherine Tramell. Milena Gardosh.

424
00:35:08,191 --> 00:35:10,693
Oh, you're Dr. Gardosh.

425
00:35:10,943 --> 00:35:13,905
I've heard so many wonderful things
about you.

426
00:35:14,197 --> 00:35:15,490
Catherine.

427
00:35:16,741 --> 00:35:18,034
There you are.

428
00:35:20,953 --> 00:35:24,540
Milena, Dr. Glass.
I see you've met Catherine.

429
00:35:24,791 --> 00:35:29,170
She's doing research for a novel about
an eminent psychoanalyst.

430
00:35:29,462 --> 00:35:32,381
I thought she might enjoy an occasion
like this.

431
00:35:35,134 --> 00:35:36,928
Well, may I take your coats?

432
00:35:38,471 --> 00:35:40,181
Thank you.

433
00:35:40,431 --> 00:35:41,682
Excuse me.

434
00:35:44,185 --> 00:35:46,521
Would you put that in my pocket?

435
00:35:48,356 --> 00:35:49,356
Certainly.

436
00:35:51,234 --> 00:35:53,569
Catherine, come this way.

437
00:35:55,029 --> 00:35:58,991
What's going on? What was Gerst
thinking of, bringing her here?

438
00:35:59,242 --> 00:36:01,577
I'm sure he's no idea who she is.

439
00:36:01,828 --> 00:36:03,538
Where did he meet her?

440
00:36:03,788 --> 00:36:05,998
She would have met him, believe me.

441
00:36:07,041 --> 00:36:10,628
I can't stay here while I've got
a patient here. I have to go.

442
00:36:10,878 --> 00:36:12,088
I understand.

443
00:36:14,674 --> 00:36:17,552
If you follow inter-subjectivity to its
natural end...

444
00:36:17,802 --> 00:36:20,888
aren't you asking who's the patient
and who's the doctor?

445
00:36:21,180 --> 00:36:23,015
Those were my very words.

446
00:36:23,224 --> 00:36:24,517
Very good.

447
00:36:25,685 --> 00:36:28,145
Note that one for future reference.

448
00:36:37,613 --> 00:36:39,740
Are you leaving because of me?

449
00:36:43,286 --> 00:36:45,162
You must have known I'd be here.

450
00:36:45,371 --> 00:36:47,164
Is that a problem?

451
00:36:47,415 --> 00:36:50,543
I know some people who play tennis
with their shrinks.

452
00:36:50,793 --> 00:36:52,128
I'm sure you do.

453
00:36:52,378 --> 00:36:56,424
Have sex with them. Sell them drugs.
Work on their screenplays.

454
00:36:56,674 --> 00:36:58,175
But I don't do that.

455
00:36:59,468 --> 00:37:03,180
I was upset about our session today.

456
00:37:03,431 --> 00:37:06,350
I felt I owed you an apology.

457
00:37:06,767 --> 00:37:08,728
That's why I came.

458
00:37:10,396 --> 00:37:12,481
We can go into that tomorrow.

459
00:37:13,024 --> 00:37:14,942
I've got a better idea.

460
00:37:15,192 --> 00:37:19,238
How about I ditch everybody
and we go somewhere for a drink.

461
00:37:19,697 --> 00:37:23,284
I told you, I don't socialize with my
patients.

462
00:37:23,784 --> 00:37:26,078
Another one of your rules?

463
00:37:26,329 --> 00:37:28,664
Don't you get kind of tired of them?

464
00:37:28,915 --> 00:37:32,168
Ni

465
00:37:32,418 --> 00:37:35,004
Too many answers,
too many questions...

466
00:37:35,254 --> 00:37:36,714
nobody gets laid.

467
00:37:42,178 --> 00:37:44,931
Okay, forget getting laid.

468
00:37:47,183 --> 00:37:48,601
We'll just talk.

469
00:37:50,019 --> 00:37:51,979
We'll talk tomorrow.

470
00:38:10,915 --> 00:38:13,417
Michael. There you are.

471
00:38:13,668 --> 00:38:18,047
Oh, my God. Did you see that woman
that Gerst brought with him?

472
00:38:18,297 --> 00:38:19,507
No.

473
00:38:19,757 --> 00:38:22,385
Actually, I was just looking for you.

474
00:38:23,678 --> 00:38:24,804
What, in there?

475
00:38:25,054 --> 00:38:28,015
I was looking for your coat.
I thought we could go for a drink.

476
00:38:28,265 --> 00:38:29,265
If that's all right?

477
00:38:32,353 --> 00:38:34,105
Yeah. Great.

478
00:39:15,521 --> 00:39:17,148
What's wrong?

479
00:39:17,398 --> 00:39:18,524
Turn around.

480
00:39:18,774 --> 00:39:19,774
What?

481
00:39:19,942 --> 00:39:21,235
Turn around.

482
00:40:03,194 --> 00:40:04,320
Oh, God!

483
00:40:05,571 --> 00:40:09,617
<i>Michael, it's Denise!
Please pick up the phone! Please!</i>

484
00:40:09,867 --> 00:40:12,286
<i>Michael, please pick up the phone!</i>

485
00:40:12,536 --> 00:40:13,913
Denise?

486
00:40:14,413 --> 00:40:16,624
Hey, hey, hey. What's happened?

487
00:40:31,764 --> 00:40:33,516
Thanks, guv.

488
00:40:37,853 --> 00:40:39,772
Come in, Michael.

489
00:40:40,022 --> 00:40:41,607
Hey, you okay?

490
00:40:44,235 --> 00:40:45,986
HEY, What's going on?

491
00:40:46,237 --> 00:40:48,697
It's okay, I'm here now. Okay?

492
00:40:48,906 --> 00:40:50,324
Who lives here?

493
00:40:50,574 --> 00:40:52,326
It's Adam's place.

494
00:41:29,363 --> 00:41:30,531
Jesus.

495
00:41:31,115 --> 00:41:32,783
What happened?

496
00:41:33,033 --> 00:41:37,663
I don't know. The door was unlocked
and I just came in.

497
00:41:37,913 --> 00:41:39,832
I just saw him lying there.

498
00:41:42,293 --> 00:41:44,211
Have you called the police?

499
00:41:44,461 --> 00:41:46,297
No. I was afraid.

500
00:42:35,095 --> 00:42:36,847
Hello, Michael.

501
00:42:37,097 --> 00:42:38,891
What are you doing here?

502
00:42:39,141 --> 00:42:41,393
It's my wife. Well, my ex-wife.

503
00:42:41,602 --> 00:42:44,313
She found him like that,
then she called me.

504
00:42:50,778 --> 00:42:51,946
I see.

505
00:42:52,196 --> 00:42:56,200
And how did she happen to
find him like that?

506
00:42:57,284 --> 00:42:59,995
They'd been seeing each other and...

507
00:43:02,414 --> 00:43:03,832
Oh, really?

508
00:43:04,041 --> 00:43:05,542
Since when?

509
00:43:07,002 --> 00:43:08,712
It's why I moved out.

510
00:43:10,256 --> 00:43:13,926
So I assume you weren't
the best of friends?

511
00:43:14,176 --> 00:43:15,177
No.

512
00:43:17,638 --> 00:43:20,683
Yet I saw you talking to him
after the Tramell hearing.

513
00:43:20,933 --> 00:43:22,559
It was just journalist stuff.

514
00:43:22,810 --> 00:43:25,604
He was asking me questions about
Tramell.

515
00:43:25,854 --> 00:43:27,648
Do you think she killed him?

516
00:43:29,358 --> 00:43:30,359
Who?

517
00:43:33,612 --> 00:43:35,322
Denise? No.

518
00:43:35,572 --> 00:43:37,658
No, not a chance.

519
00:43:37,908 --> 00:43:41,328
I've known her for a long time.
She could never do anything like that.

520
00:43:43,539 --> 00:43:47,501
Listen, Roy, I've told my story twice
over. Is it all right if I go home?

521
00:43:49,295 --> 00:43:50,337
All right.

522
00:43:52,923 --> 00:43:54,383
Oh, by the way...

523
00:43:57,303 --> 00:43:58,429
this yours?

524
00:44:02,016 --> 00:44:04,977
No, I just found it on the floor.

525
00:44:06,478 --> 00:44:08,772
How did it end up in the rubbish?

526
00:44:09,189 --> 00:44:13,444
I stepped on it. It was leaking.
I just threw it away.

527
00:44:16,947 --> 00:44:18,407
Can I go?

528
00:44:22,077 --> 00:44:23,787
Yes, by all means.

529
00:45:27,935 --> 00:45:30,562
I assume you know Adam Towers
was killed.

530
00:45:32,064 --> 00:45:33,690
Why would I know?

531
00:45:34,149 --> 00:45:36,610
Because of Denise.

532
00:45:36,860 --> 00:45:38,112
Denise?

533
00:45:38,362 --> 00:45:39,822
Your wife. Your ex-wife.

534
00:45:40,072 --> 00:45:42,449
I know who she is.
How do you know her?

535
00:45:43,033 --> 00:45:46,161
Adam introduced us a couple of times.

536
00:45:46,412 --> 00:45:50,416
It was all very open. I knew about her,
she knew about me.

537
00:45:50,666 --> 00:45:52,042
Knew what about you?

538
00:45:55,254 --> 00:45:57,381
That I was seeing him too.

539
00:45:58,590 --> 00:46:01,135
The Masters and Johnson guy.
That was him.

540
00:46:01,385 --> 00:46:04,430
So... You were sleeping
with Adam Towers?

541
00:46:05,013 --> 00:46:06,807
Occasionally.

542
00:46:10,185 --> 00:46:12,604
So, of course,
Washburn thinks I killed him.

543
00:46:12,855 --> 00:46:14,356
Why would he think that?

544
00:46:15,774 --> 00:46:20,737
I kill because I'm addicted to risk.
Or to prove that I exist.

545
00:46:20,946 --> 00:46:22,406
I'm not sure which one it is.

546
00:46:22,656 --> 00:46:24,575
I never said you killed anybody.

547
00:46:24,825 --> 00:46:26,034
But you think I did.

548
00:46:26,285 --> 00:46:31,081
You think I killed Kevin, and now
you're wondering if I killed Adam.

549
00:46:31,290 --> 00:46:34,918
Why don't you just ask me?
Or is that too direct for you?

550
00:46:37,463 --> 00:46:38,922
Did you kill him?

551
00:46:39,923 --> 00:46:43,218
If I said I didn't,
would you believe me?

552
00:46:46,889 --> 00:46:47,889
Depends.

553
00:46:48,348 --> 00:46:52,102
On what?
The quality of my performance?

554
00:46:52,352 --> 00:46:56,106
You know what?
I'm glad Adam Towers is dead.

555
00:46:56,356 --> 00:46:57,983
And you should be glad too.

556
00:46:58,233 --> 00:47:00,986
If you're too uptight,
I'll be glad for you.

557
00:47:01,236 --> 00:47:03,322
Whoever killed him did you a favor.

558
00:47:03,572 --> 00:47:04,698
Favor?

559
00:47:04,990 --> 00:47:09,244
If he'd written that article on Cheslav,
it would've ruined your career.

560
00:47:09,703 --> 00:47:12,706
You haven't told me if you killed him.
Can you put that out?

561
00:47:15,792 --> 00:47:18,712
Put it out now or you can leave,
okay?!

562
00:47:26,053 --> 00:47:27,304
Is that better?

563
00:48:06,426 --> 00:48:10,222
When you think about fucking me...

564
00:48:10,472 --> 00:48:12,849
and I know you do...

565
00:48:13,100 --> 00:48:16,728
how do you picture it, doctor?

566
00:48:19,356 --> 00:48:23,485
Oh, I know you can't answer me,
so just think it.

567
00:48:24,695 --> 00:48:26,446
Do you want it straight up?

568
00:48:26,697 --> 00:48:28,156
You on top?

569
00:48:28,365 --> 00:48:29,783
Me on tOD?

570
00:48:31,577 --> 00:48:34,329
Do you want it from behind...

571
00:48:37,207 --> 00:48:41,003
on your knees,
my face in the pillow?

572
00:48:42,379 --> 00:48:45,132
Do you want to beat me up...

573
00:48:45,716 --> 00:48:47,843
just a little?

574
00:48:48,135 --> 00:48:50,053
Not too hard.

575
00:48:51,847 --> 00:48:54,725
Oh, a little harder than that.

576
00:48:57,936 --> 00:49:00,564
Do you want to come in my mouth?

577
00:49:03,400 --> 00:49:08,614
What if I told you that I masturbate
thinking about you?

578
00:49:10,032 --> 00:49:12,117
That I make myself come...

579
00:49:12,367 --> 00:49:16,455
thinking about you
making yourself come.

580
00:49:27,007 --> 00:49:29,384
I guess we're out of time for today.

581
00:49:40,103 --> 00:49:42,022
I'm terminating therapy.

582
00:49:42,230 --> 00:49:43,774
Send me the bill.

583
00:50:28,276 --> 00:50:30,612
Are you feeling all right?

584
00:50:59,933 --> 00:51:01,727
Miss Tramell, it's Dr. Glass here.

585
00:51:02,519 --> 00:51:05,689
Listen, I'm concerned about how our
session ended today.

586
00:51:05,939 --> 00:51:08,567
I'd like to talk through
any misunderstandings...

587
00:51:08,817 --> 00:51:10,819
there might be between us.

588
00:51:11,069 --> 00:51:14,114
As soon as you get this message,
please give me a...

589
00:51:15,532 --> 00:51:17,659
Just call me when you can.

590
00:51:17,909 --> 00:51:19,703
Evening, Dr. Glass.

591
00:51:20,787 --> 00:51:22,330
Could I have a word?

592
00:51:22,581 --> 00:51:24,499
Sure. Upstairs.

593
00:51:29,421 --> 00:51:31,047
Is that German?

594
00:51:31,298 --> 00:51:32,716
Can I get you anything?

595
00:51:32,966 --> 00:51:34,134
No.

596
00:51:34,384 --> 00:51:36,261
So here's a surprise.

597
00:51:36,511 --> 00:51:40,849
Adam Towers had a girlfriend
besides Denise.

598
00:51:41,099 --> 00:51:42,350
Guess who.

599
00:51:43,810 --> 00:51:45,520
Catherine Tramell.

600
00:51:47,022 --> 00:51:48,315
You don't look surprised.

601
00:51:48,523 --> 00:51:50,442
She's a private patient of mine.

602
00:51:50,692 --> 00:51:52,110
I see. Since when?

603
00:51:52,360 --> 00:51:53,361
Not long.

604
00:51:54,654 --> 00:51:59,326
So your ex and your private patient
were both screwing Adam Towers.

605
00:51:59,576 --> 00:52:02,662
That's quite a coincidence.
Did they know each other?

606
00:52:02,913 --> 00:52:05,373
I don't know. I don't think so.
Did you...?

607
00:52:07,959 --> 00:52:13,131
Tramell's prints were all over Towers'
apartment, along with others.

608
00:52:13,381 --> 00:52:17,511
But what's interesting is the last call
he made was to her mobile phone...

609
00:52:17,761 --> 00:52:19,805
90 minutes before he died.

610
00:52:20,055 --> 00:52:22,307
Her story is she was out walking all
that time.

611
00:52:22,557 --> 00:52:26,311
Two hours strolling around Clerkenwell
and nobody saw her, so...

612
00:52:26,561 --> 00:52:29,523
Come on, Michael. Talk to me.

613
00:52:30,607 --> 00:52:34,444
I can't tell you anything. Even if I
knew something, which I don't.

614
00:52:36,029 --> 00:52:40,033
Franks was first. Towers second.
There's bound to be a third.

615
00:52:40,283 --> 00:52:41,993
This goes beyond confidentiality.

616
00:52:42,244 --> 00:52:45,747
You've got a legal obligation to protect
a potential victim.

617
00:52:45,997 --> 00:52:49,918
You can't lock somebody up because
you think they might do something.

618
00:52:50,168 --> 00:52:53,547
Why don't you tell me what you know
about this article...

619
00:52:53,797 --> 00:52:57,217
Towers was writing about you
and our old friend George Cheslav.

620
00:52:59,678 --> 00:53:01,847
Who told you
he was writing an article?

621
00:53:02,222 --> 00:53:03,348
His editor.

622
00:53:03,598 --> 00:53:06,643
He'd been very busy.
He had a lot of information on you.

623
00:53:08,478 --> 00:53:10,146
What, and you think I killed him...

624
00:53:10,397 --> 00:53:12,607
to stop him writing
some stupid article?

625
00:53:13,316 --> 00:53:18,697
No. But just for the record, why don't
you tell me how you spent last night.

626
00:53:18,947 --> 00:53:21,783
Between, say,
7 p.m. and 2 in the morning.

627
00:53:22,033 --> 00:53:24,494
You know, broad strokes.

628
00:53:27,080 --> 00:53:29,374
I had patients until 8 p.m.

629
00:53:29,624 --> 00:53:31,668
Then went to a party
in Collingham Gardens.

630
00:53:31,918 --> 00:53:33,628
I left there about 11 with a woman.

631
00:53:33,879 --> 00:53:37,591
We came here and I was on my knees
fucking her when Denise called.

632
00:53:41,970 --> 00:53:43,680
On your knees, eh?

633
00:53:44,931 --> 00:53:47,934
Sounds like your evening
was better than mine.

634
00:53:48,184 --> 00:53:52,230
Could I get her name?
So there are no loose ends.

635
00:53:54,566 --> 00:53:58,278
Look, Michael, Adam Towers
was fucking your ex-wife...

636
00:53:58,528 --> 00:54:02,824
and about to do the same
to your career. I've got to ask.

637
00:54:07,704 --> 00:54:09,205
Michelle Broadwin.

638
00:54:10,832 --> 00:54:15,211
She's a psycho-pharmacologist at
Victoria Psychiatric Hospital.

639
00:54:18,590 --> 00:54:19,674
Thank you.

640
00:54:22,093 --> 00:54:23,511
I'll be in touch.

641
00:54:28,767 --> 00:54:29,893
What does that mean?

642
00:54:33,772 --> 00:54:35,315
I smell blood.

643
00:54:50,455 --> 00:54:55,377
Yeah, not all of them, of course, but,
you know, some of them.

644
00:54:55,627 --> 00:54:59,464
They're all so sanctimonious...

645
00:54:59,714 --> 00:55:01,800
so judgmental.

646
00:55:02,050 --> 00:55:07,514
All my friends, they drink too much.
They snort too much coke.

647
00:55:07,764 --> 00:55:10,141
<i>Miss Tramell,
it's Dr. Glass here again.</i>

648
00:55:10,392 --> 00:55:13,144
I'm a little concerned
I haven't heard from you.

649
00:55:13,395 --> 00:55:15,647
I was wondering whether you're okay.

650
00:55:15,897 --> 00:55:19,901
Look, let me give you
my home number. It's 0207...

651
00:55:20,151 --> 00:55:24,364
Sorry, it really got to me and I don't
know why it seems to be doing that.

652
00:55:24,614 --> 00:55:28,743
Why it's getting worse.
I mean, I was really excited.

653
00:55:28,994 --> 00:55:31,913
<i>You have no new messages.</i>

654
00:55:59,274 --> 00:56:01,109
The thing about Gerst is this:

655
00:56:01,359 --> 00:56:04,112
The selection committee
is just a formality.

656
00:56:04,362 --> 00:56:06,281
This is the real interview.

657
00:56:08,033 --> 00:56:09,784
Relax.

658
00:56:09,993 --> 00:56:12,912
Be direct, candid.

659
00:56:13,204 --> 00:56:15,582
But not too candid.

660
00:56:17,709 --> 00:56:21,546
Very good time. They always get lost
on the way. Come in.

661
00:56:21,796 --> 00:56:23,590
Meet my new Mughal painting.

662
00:56:23,840 --> 00:56:25,550
Not another one.

663
00:56:25,800 --> 00:56:29,971
An Indian goddess at peace. It has a
tranquility to it, don't you think?

664
00:56:30,638 --> 00:56:34,517
I wonder what the males are doing,
loitering so close to her?

665
00:56:34,768 --> 00:56:38,188
It's obvious. They're worshiping her.

666
00:56:38,480 --> 00:56:39,606
As they should.

667
00:56:40,065 --> 00:56:43,568
Perhaps that's why she has eight arms
to fend them off.

668
00:56:43,818 --> 00:56:48,114
Why don't you girls go outside
while Dr. Glass and I have our chat.

669
00:56:49,574 --> 00:56:51,785
Come. Come.

670
00:56:52,410 --> 00:56:55,371
Come with me. You'll enjoy it.

671
00:56:59,751 --> 00:57:02,754
So, Dr. Glass, I have a question:

672
00:57:03,213 --> 00:57:04,923
Do you think I'm insane?

673
00:57:06,758 --> 00:57:07,758
Pardon?

674
00:57:08,259 --> 00:57:10,386
Nuts? Bonkers? Off my trolley?

675
00:57:11,262 --> 00:57:12,889
No, not at all.

676
00:57:13,515 --> 00:57:16,768
But I might be if I recommended you
for the Douglas Chair.

677
00:57:19,229 --> 00:57:20,480
I'm sorry, I don't understand.

678
00:57:21,189 --> 00:57:23,108
George Cheslav.

679
00:57:23,775 --> 00:57:28,822
A major drug dealer, under your care,
brutally murders his girlfriend.

680
00:57:29,072 --> 00:57:31,199
An inquiry is held...

681
00:57:31,449 --> 00:57:35,161
where Detective Roy Washburn...

682
00:57:35,411 --> 00:57:38,706
testifies that you acted
professionally at all times.

683
00:57:38,957 --> 00:57:39,957
You're blameless.

684
00:57:40,083 --> 00:57:41,167
That's right, I was.

685
00:57:42,168 --> 00:57:45,880
However, after the trial...

686
00:57:46,131 --> 00:57:49,843
you experienced what we might term
an emotional meltdown:

687
00:57:50,135 --> 00:57:51,344
Depression...

688
00:57:51,594 --> 00:57:53,721
occupational underachievement...

689
00:57:53,930 --> 00:57:55,598
marital problems...

690
00:57:55,849 --> 00:57:59,227
and questionable professional
conduct...

691
00:57:59,477 --> 00:58:03,356
much discussed at dinner parties
around our great city.

692
00:58:05,775 --> 00:58:06,818
I'm sorry?

693
00:58:08,153 --> 00:58:10,864
Now you want my support
for the Douglas Chair.

694
00:58:15,994 --> 00:58:18,204
No more Cheslavs, Michael.

695
00:58:21,166 --> 00:58:22,292
No.

696
00:58:28,590 --> 00:58:30,300
No more Cheslavs.

697
01:00:10,483 --> 01:00:11,483
Catherine!

698
01:00:25,540 --> 01:00:28,835
Sorry. All right.
Sorry, I'm just looking for someone.

699
01:01:44,744 --> 01:01:46,913
God, Michael, how dramatic.

700
01:01:47,205 --> 01:01:48,205
I know.

701
01:01:48,373 --> 01:01:52,043
I thought she was in danger,
but I know that's not the point.

702
01:01:52,293 --> 01:01:54,295
She could be a murderer twice over...

703
01:01:54,545 --> 01:01:58,091
and you're acting like she's a
princess you have to rescue.

704
01:01:58,383 --> 01:02:00,551
Don't patronize me, please.

705
01:02:02,387 --> 01:02:04,347
It's driving me crazy.

706
01:02:06,641 --> 01:02:08,893
You're in love with her, aren't you?

707
01:02:10,478 --> 01:02:12,271
Not love. It's...

708
01:02:14,565 --> 01:02:15,942
I don't know.

709
01:02:20,613 --> 01:02:23,741
You have to terminate this therapy,
right away.

710
01:02:25,034 --> 01:02:28,162
Well, it's already done.
She terminated it herself.

711
01:02:28,413 --> 01:02:29,413
Good.

712
01:02:30,415 --> 01:02:33,459
If she calls again, give her my number.

713
01:02:37,672 --> 01:02:39,632
I'm a woman.

714
01:02:39,882 --> 01:02:42,677
She'll relate to me differently.

715
01:03:25,928 --> 01:03:27,847
What are you doing here?

716
01:03:28,097 --> 01:03:30,266
Where she goes, I go.

717
01:03:30,516 --> 01:03:31,601
Since when?

718
01:03:31,851 --> 01:03:35,480
Since she started coming
to your office five days a week.

719
01:03:38,232 --> 01:03:43,029
So, Adam Towers.
Seems his research has gone missing.

720
01:03:43,279 --> 01:03:46,240
All his notebooks, audiotapes,
even his hard drive.

721
01:03:46,491 --> 01:03:49,202
Everything on George Cheslav
and Michael Glass.

722
01:03:49,452 --> 01:03:51,996
- You think Catherine has it?
- I know she does.

723
01:03:52,246 --> 01:03:55,583
She ever tell you about them
when she's chatting on the couch?

724
01:03:55,791 --> 01:03:57,001
You know I can't discuss that.

725
01:03:57,251 --> 01:04:00,463
Come on. I've been very good to you
these past few years.

726
01:04:00,713 --> 01:04:03,466
I'm practically a psychopath
delivery service.

727
01:04:03,716 --> 01:04:05,259
I can't break privilege.

728
01:04:05,510 --> 01:04:08,804
Pity. I have something
you might like to know about.

729
01:04:09,055 --> 01:04:12,433
Someone says you'd been lying
at the Cheslav inquest.

730
01:04:12,683 --> 01:04:14,101
Who?

731
01:04:14,352 --> 01:04:16,896
You want me to break privilege?

732
01:04:18,397 --> 01:04:21,817
Since you're a friend,
it was your ex-wife.

733
01:04:22,068 --> 01:04:23,528
Denise?

734
01:04:23,819 --> 01:04:25,571
You want to sort her out.

735
01:04:25,821 --> 01:04:29,742
Who knows, she might tell you
where Towers' notes went.

736
01:04:52,098 --> 01:04:56,394
Someone's here.
Do you want us to say?

737
01:04:56,644 --> 01:04:58,980
I'll be all right. Don't worry.

738
01:04:59,230 --> 01:05:00,731
We'll see you later.

739
01:05:04,151 --> 01:05:05,236
How you doing?

740
01:05:06,946 --> 01:05:08,114
Okay.

741
01:05:09,865 --> 01:05:11,117
Do you want a drink?

742
01:05:11,367 --> 01:05:13,578
No, I have to go.

743
01:05:13,828 --> 01:05:16,497
I'm meeting someone
at the Atlantic Bar.

744
01:05:17,582 --> 01:05:22,420
Denise, did you tell Towers that
I lied at the Cheslav inquiry?

745
01:05:23,921 --> 01:05:26,966
Of course, there's always an agenda.

746
01:05:27,216 --> 01:05:31,095
No. I said you knew he was going
to kill his girlfriend.

747
01:05:31,345 --> 01:05:32,555
I didn't. That's a lie.

748
01:05:32,805 --> 01:05:34,015
Yes, you did.

749
01:05:34,265 --> 01:05:38,728
You kept saying how you knew
and should have gone to the police.

750
01:05:39,020 --> 01:05:43,566
I didn't know. I sensed. And I told you
that as my wife in confidence.

751
01:05:43,816 --> 01:05:47,778
I didn't think you'd go and repeat it
in bed to some moron reporter.

752
01:05:50,239 --> 01:05:53,826
Do you want to ruin my life, is that it?
You want to ruin my practice?

753
01:05:55,161 --> 01:05:58,539
Your life? Your practice?

754
01:05:58,789 --> 01:06:02,001
Catherine was right,
everything's always about you.

755
01:06:02,251 --> 01:06:05,296
What about me? Adam's dead
and I'm a murder suspect.

756
01:06:05,546 --> 01:06:09,967
Washburn keeps going on about me
not cooperating, like I'm a liar.

757
01:06:10,217 --> 01:06:12,136
I don't know where Adam's notes are.

758
01:06:12,386 --> 01:06:15,723
I'm scared to go home. I'm scared
to go out. I'm going out of my mind.

759
01:06:15,931 --> 01:06:17,224
Be careful about Catherine.

760
01:06:17,475 --> 01:06:18,809
Don't tell me what to do!

761
01:06:19,018 --> 01:06:20,018
Just calm down.

762
01:06:20,227 --> 01:06:22,188
Don't tell me to fucking calm down!

763
01:06:22,438 --> 01:06:23,438
Hey, come on.

764
01:06:23,606 --> 01:06:26,692
That's my wife, okay?
This is a private conversation.

765
01:06:26,942 --> 01:06:28,903
Get out of my way! Out of my way!

766
01:08:34,028 --> 01:08:36,489
Denise. Oh, Denise!

767
01:08:36,739 --> 01:08:38,032
Come on.

768
01:08:39,116 --> 01:08:41,118
Come on, come on.

769
01:08:48,125 --> 01:08:50,711
Come on, Denise. Look at me.

770
01:08:51,962 --> 01:08:53,380
Call an ambulance!

771
01:08:53,923 --> 01:08:55,508
Do it now!

772
01:08:56,592 --> 01:08:58,469
Come on. Let's go.

773
01:08:59,929 --> 01:09:03,057
Stay with me. Come on. Stay with me.

774
01:09:04,391 --> 01:09:06,227
Come on. Stay with me.

775
01:09:39,260 --> 01:09:41,470
You have a problem, Michael.

776
01:09:43,347 --> 01:09:47,142
Witnesses say they saw you arguing.
She was crying.

777
01:09:47,393 --> 01:09:50,354
You grabbed her.
She almost fell down.

778
01:09:50,604 --> 01:09:54,149
Five minutes later,
somebody slits her throat.

779
01:09:56,026 --> 01:09:59,989
Also, there are people here who think
you killed Towers.

780
01:10:00,239 --> 01:10:03,576
Towers? Didn't you speak to Michelle?

781
01:10:03,826 --> 01:10:07,538
Yes. But now I'm hearing about this
cigarette lighter with your prints on it.

782
01:10:07,788 --> 01:10:08,831
I just picked that up.

783
01:10:09,039 --> 01:10:13,836
And your ex is in a coma just as she's
to say something inconvenient for you.

784
01:10:14,086 --> 01:10:16,005
I was trying to save her life.

785
01:10:20,467 --> 01:10:24,388
<i>Look, I spoke to Towers' assistant
at Urbane magazine.</i>

786
01:10:24,597 --> 01:10:28,475
He expected Denise to say that you
perjured yourself at Cheslav's inquiry.

787
01:10:28,726 --> 01:10:30,185
She wasn't going to say that.

788
01:10:30,436 --> 01:10:32,187
What was she going to say?

789
01:10:38,402 --> 01:10:39,612
Sorry, guv.

790
01:10:49,663 --> 01:10:51,165
You wait there.

791
01:11:48,806 --> 01:11:49,974
So...

792
01:11:51,558 --> 01:11:56,689
Your ex and Catherine Tramell
were girl buddies. Did you know that?

793
01:11:58,065 --> 01:12:00,067
What do you mean "girl buddies"?

794
01:12:00,317 --> 01:12:04,822
According to Catherine,
they met through Towers and hit it off.

795
01:12:08,409 --> 01:12:11,495
Denise told Catherine that Towers had
been pressuring her...

796
01:12:11,745 --> 01:12:14,456
into saying that you'd perjured
yourself.

797
01:12:14,707 --> 01:12:18,585
But Denise wasn't having it.
She was going to say you were clean.

798
01:12:20,212 --> 01:12:23,465
You didn't know Cheslav was going to
kill his girlfriend, did you?

799
01:12:23,716 --> 01:12:26,468
In fact, it came
as a complete surprise, didn't it?

800
01:12:31,557 --> 01:12:33,767
- Of course she's lying.
- How do you know?

801
01:12:34,018 --> 01:12:38,147
Everything that comes out of her is a
lie. Even the truth's a lie with her.

802
01:12:38,397 --> 01:12:41,358
It's her way of getting you to think
what she wants you to think.

803
01:12:41,608 --> 01:12:43,777
That's her art. The art of mind-fucking.

804
01:12:44,028 --> 01:12:45,738
She might be a talented writer.

805
01:12:45,946 --> 01:12:49,199
When it comes to mind-fucking,
she's the all-time genius.

806
01:12:52,661 --> 01:12:54,705
She really got to you, didn't she?

807
01:12:58,042 --> 01:13:01,128
What do you mean?
What did she tell you about me?

808
01:13:01,712 --> 01:13:04,214
Well, what is there to tell?

809
01:13:04,465 --> 01:13:08,343
Don't play games with me.
She can pull it off, you can't.

810
01:13:12,765 --> 01:13:13,932
Where are you going?

811
01:13:14,183 --> 01:13:18,103
Someplace else. Unless
you have evidence to charge me.

812
01:13:19,438 --> 01:13:20,606
Do you?

813
01:13:22,649 --> 01:13:24,234
I didn't think so.

814
01:14:02,940 --> 01:14:05,067
He let you go, finally.

815
01:14:05,317 --> 01:14:06,777
I was worried.

816
01:14:07,861 --> 01:14:10,989
You lied to Washburn for me. Why?

817
01:14:11,406 --> 01:14:14,076
I knew you hadn't hurt Denise.

818
01:14:14,326 --> 01:14:16,787
How could you know that?

819
01:14:17,037 --> 01:14:19,873
Because I know you.

820
01:14:20,124 --> 01:14:23,752
And I know the cops were keeping you
just to play some kind of game.

821
01:14:24,002 --> 01:14:26,380
What, like getting me
to talk about you?

822
01:14:26,630 --> 01:14:31,468
Yeah, but you wouldn't do that,
because you're into confidentiality.

823
01:14:34,763 --> 01:14:36,723
Why were you meeting with Denise?

824
01:14:37,266 --> 01:14:39,852
Research for my novel.

825
01:14:40,310 --> 01:14:41,603
Research.

826
01:14:41,854 --> 01:14:42,896
About what?

827
01:14:43,188 --> 01:14:44,857
About you.

828
01:14:45,107 --> 01:14:48,026
And Cheslav, the masked psychotic.

829
01:14:51,113 --> 01:14:54,616
The analyst in my book is obsessed
with that sort of thing.

830
01:14:56,660 --> 01:14:59,621
Washburn thinks
that you slit Denise's throat.

831
01:15:01,248 --> 01:15:04,668
Me? You're the one that hated her.

832
01:15:04,918 --> 01:15:07,880
Maybe I'm acting out
your unconscious impulses.

833
01:15:08,213 --> 01:15:09,423
Stop it!

834
01:15:12,551 --> 01:15:16,680
Do you think it's possible that
you want me to be the killer?

835
01:15:16,930 --> 01:15:21,268
You know, how some guys
are into blonds...

836
01:15:21,518 --> 01:15:23,854
and some guys are into killers.

837
01:15:25,522 --> 01:15:27,191
Isn't that what you're into?

838
01:15:30,485 --> 01:15:32,988
Isn't that what turns you on?

839
01:15:35,407 --> 01:15:36,742
Turns me on?

840
01:15:41,413 --> 01:15:43,707
Isn't that why you're over here?

841
01:16:26,792 --> 01:16:27,793
Okay.

842
01:16:29,044 --> 01:16:30,587
I trust you.

843
01:16:31,964 --> 01:16:33,382
You trust me.

844
01:17:55,505 --> 01:17:57,841
Is there somewhere we can talk?

845
01:17:58,091 --> 01:17:59,468
Over there.

846
01:18:14,858 --> 01:18:16,360
Can I guess where you got it?

847
01:18:16,610 --> 01:18:18,403
Let's find out what it is first.

848
01:18:18,653 --> 01:18:23,200
It would be highly improper of me to
accept any evidence in this fashion.

849
01:18:23,450 --> 01:18:24,618
Fine.

850
01:18:24,826 --> 01:18:28,163
It'll take me a few days
to get it analyzed.

851
01:18:28,413 --> 01:18:31,249
You'd have made a good cop, Michael.

852
01:18:31,500 --> 01:18:33,710
You like the smell of blood.

853
01:18:42,302 --> 01:18:44,304
Dr. Glass.

854
01:18:44,554 --> 01:18:46,306
Hold on.

855
01:18:46,556 --> 01:18:49,226
I was just thinking about you.

856
01:18:49,476 --> 01:18:52,854
I might have more
psychiatric evaluations for you.

857
01:18:53,105 --> 01:18:55,190
That's nice, but I'm busy
at the moment.

858
01:18:55,857 --> 01:19:00,362
Oh, that's a pity.
You were so good with Catherine.

859
01:19:00,612 --> 01:19:03,865
She tells me you're very perceptive.

860
01:19:04,116 --> 01:19:06,493
She's very perceptive herself.

861
01:19:09,955 --> 01:19:14,709
I hope Detective Washburn isn't giving
you cause for...

862
01:19:14,960 --> 01:19:16,169
concern?

863
01:19:17,587 --> 01:19:19,047
What do you mean?

864
01:19:19,297 --> 01:19:21,842
Well, given his past record.

865
01:19:24,928 --> 01:19:26,471
What past record?

866
01:20:29,159 --> 01:20:30,660
I want to talk to you.

867
01:20:30,911 --> 01:20:32,662
Oh, so now you want to talk.

868
01:20:32,913 --> 01:20:36,791
Look, this "Dirtiest Cop in London,"
it doesn't mention him by name.

869
01:20:37,042 --> 01:20:40,545
But this "Detective X,"
is that Roy Washburn?

870
01:20:43,548 --> 01:20:45,133
Is it Washburn?

871
01:20:46,259 --> 01:20:47,552
Excuse me?

872
01:20:51,640 --> 01:20:53,433
Yeah, it's him.

873
01:20:56,937 --> 01:20:58,021
Are you sure?

874
01:20:58,271 --> 01:21:02,317
Adam may have been a sloppy writer,
but he had excellent sources.

875
01:21:02,567 --> 01:21:06,905
What about perjury, intimidation,
falsifying evidence. Is that true?

876
01:21:07,155 --> 01:21:08,740
A policeman fabricating evidence.

877
01:21:08,990 --> 01:21:10,033
But you have proof?

878
01:21:10,283 --> 01:21:13,370
How about Kevin Franks
and the Case of the Killer Orgasm?

879
01:21:13,620 --> 01:21:16,706
When I did Catherine Tramell's
assessment, I read that report.

880
01:21:16,915 --> 01:21:19,626
In

881
01:21:19,834 --> 01:21:22,963
Yeah, well, who found
the syringes in the car?

882
01:21:23,213 --> 01:21:25,215
But why would Washburn do that?

883
01:21:25,465 --> 01:21:27,759
Adam thought he did it to set up
Catherine Tramell.

884
01:21:28,009 --> 01:21:29,719
Why didn't he write about it?

885
01:21:32,764 --> 01:21:34,391
That's the whole point.

886
01:21:35,475 --> 01:21:37,227
He was going to.

887
01:21:38,395 --> 01:21:40,063
Then he got killed.

888
01:22:03,378 --> 01:22:06,923
I owe you an apology.
About Roy Washburn. L...

889
01:22:07,173 --> 01:22:08,550
I don't like apologies.

890
01:22:11,553 --> 01:22:16,474
I also don't like people stealing things
from my apartment.

891
01:22:19,185 --> 01:22:23,607
The insulin? In case you haven't had it
analyzed yet.

892
01:22:24,941 --> 01:22:25,941
Insuhn?

893
01:22:26,109 --> 01:22:27,986
My friend's diabetic.

894
01:22:28,236 --> 01:22:30,822
Let yourself out, doctor.

895
01:23:26,336 --> 01:23:27,796
Hello, Michael.

896
01:23:31,341 --> 01:23:32,384
What do you want?

897
01:23:32,634 --> 01:23:34,511
I got the lab analysis back.

898
01:23:34,761 --> 01:23:38,264
D-Tubocurarine. Funny that.

899
01:23:40,100 --> 01:23:41,851
You're sure it's not insulin?

900
01:23:42,435 --> 01:23:43,895
Insuhn?

901
01:23:44,145 --> 01:23:45,230
No.

902
01:23:45,480 --> 01:23:47,524
Can I see the report?

903
01:23:49,275 --> 01:23:53,863
You've got some trust issues there.
You might want to work on that.

904
01:24:03,081 --> 01:24:06,793
This isn't an official
Forensic Services report.

905
01:24:07,001 --> 01:24:11,756
R ..

906
01:24:12,006 --> 01:24:17,262
Will be deemed inadmissible
in a future trial, Inspector Clouseau.

907
01:24:18,596 --> 01:24:21,057
So do you want to tell me
where you found it?

908
01:24:26,938 --> 01:24:28,273
She's not worth it.

909
01:24:28,481 --> 01:24:31,276
People are dying
and I will have her for it.

910
01:24:31,484 --> 01:24:33,987
If you stand in my way,
I'll have you as well.

911
01:24:34,237 --> 01:24:36,156
I can fucking promise you that.

912
01:24:41,119 --> 01:24:43,872
I've got something to show you.
Get in the car.

913
01:24:47,375 --> 01:24:48,626
Get in!

914
01:25:04,392 --> 01:25:06,728
Medical examiner's on his way.

915
01:25:20,992 --> 01:25:22,368
HeHo, guv.

916
01:25:30,627 --> 01:25:33,713
Were you working that night?

917
01:25:33,963 --> 01:25:35,882
No, I don't know.

918
01:25:37,133 --> 01:25:40,762
Did you see or hear
anything suspicious yesterday?

919
01:25:41,012 --> 01:25:42,639
Not yesterday. No.

920
01:25:42,889 --> 01:25:45,225
- Nothing?
- No.

921
01:25:45,475 --> 01:25:46,893
How long have you worked here?

922
01:25:47,185 --> 01:25:48,520
Four months.

923
01:25:48,770 --> 01:25:49,979
Four months?

924
01:25:51,231 --> 01:25:53,107
Where were you before that?

925
01:25:58,279 --> 01:25:59,279
Ted.

926
01:25:59,447 --> 01:26:00,532
Hi, guv.

927
01:26:00,782 --> 01:26:03,618
- Remember I talked to Vice earlier and
they said...

928
01:26:03,868 --> 01:26:05,578
Fergie, give me a minute.

929
01:26:05,829 --> 01:26:06,871
Let's go.

930
01:26:27,642 --> 01:26:29,143
Who is he?

931
01:26:29,394 --> 01:26:34,065
Richard Pepovic.
Known to his friends as Dickie Pep.

932
01:26:37,610 --> 01:26:38,987
You know him?

933
01:26:39,237 --> 01:26:40,613
No.

934
01:26:40,864 --> 01:26:42,407
Look at this.

935
01:26:50,748 --> 01:26:55,587
Now, we'll have to wait for the lab
results, of course...

936
01:26:55,837 --> 01:27:00,216
but what's the betting he's oozing
Tubocurarine?

937
01:27:02,427 --> 01:27:05,305
Now do you want to tell me
who gave you the sample?

938
01:27:11,477 --> 01:27:13,271
You don't know she did it.

939
01:27:14,522 --> 01:27:15,565
No.

940
01:27:17,650 --> 01:27:21,279
But then again, maybe I killed him.

941
01:27:22,363 --> 01:27:24,324
Isn't that what she's gonna tell you?

942
01:27:24,532 --> 01:27:26,618
He had something on me,
so I killed him.

943
01:27:26,868 --> 01:27:29,787
Then I jerked him off
even though he was dead...

944
01:27:30,038 --> 01:27:32,290
to make it look like
there was come everywhere...

945
01:27:32,540 --> 01:27:34,125
to make it look like it was her.

946
01:27:37,337 --> 01:27:42,342
Look, Towers was right about me,
I put them away whatever it takes.

947
01:27:42,592 --> 01:27:44,886
So, fine, don't trust me.

948
01:27:45,136 --> 01:27:47,096
You know Catherine better than me.

949
01:27:47,347 --> 01:27:49,599
If you have five seconds
when you're not dizzy...

950
01:27:49,807 --> 01:27:53,227
with the smell of her pussy,
ask yourself: Do you trust her?

951
01:27:54,812 --> 01:27:55,897
Do you?

952
01:28:01,527 --> 01:28:05,406
She's George Cheslav, times three.
We both know it.

953
01:28:05,657 --> 01:28:07,825
The question is:
How do we put her away?

954
01:28:08,076 --> 01:28:12,372
If you tell the courts that she's made a
direct threat against someone...

955
01:28:12,580 --> 01:28:13,665
But she hasn't.

956
01:28:13,915 --> 01:28:17,043
If you say she did, and that got her put
on a psych ward...

957
01:28:17,293 --> 01:28:20,421
stopped her from killing again,
wouldn't that be worth it?

958
01:28:20,672 --> 01:28:24,300
Some kind of redemption
for Cheslav at last?

959
01:28:28,012 --> 01:28:30,932
Look, I'm prejudiced.

960
01:28:31,182 --> 01:28:33,476
Don't take my word for it.

961
01:28:34,852 --> 01:28:36,604
Talk to this guy.

962
01:28:41,234 --> 01:28:42,860
Listen to him.

963
01:29:08,678 --> 01:29:11,222
Lieutenant Walker. It's Michael.

964
01:29:11,472 --> 01:29:13,474
Look, thanks for talking to me.

965
01:29:13,725 --> 01:29:16,978
It's just that I did an evaluation
of Miss Tramell...

966
01:29:25,236 --> 01:29:29,407
<i>Darkness had fallen and even before
the buzzer sounded...</i>

967
01:29:29,657 --> 01:29:32,869
<i>Kelly knew it would be the doctor.</i>

968
01:29:33,119 --> 01:29:36,164
<i>He'd come to accuse her
of more crimes.</i>

969
01:29:36,414 --> 01:29:38,875
<i>They'd fight about that
and then have sex...</i>

970
01:29:39,125 --> 01:29:41,586
<i>and everything would be
all right again.</i>

971
01:29:41,836 --> 01:29:43,379
<i>Except it wouldn't be...</i>

972
01:29:43,629 --> 01:29:45,590
<i>if he didn't trust her.</i>

973
01:30:21,542 --> 01:30:22,668
Hi, handsome.

974
01:30:23,127 --> 01:30:24,545
My new novel.

975
01:30:24,796 --> 01:30:27,381
I'm anxious to hear
what you think about it.

976
01:30:28,758 --> 01:30:31,385
I've been speaking
to Lieutenant Phil Walker...

977
01:30:31,636 --> 01:30:34,388
the San Francisco
Police Department.

978
01:30:34,639 --> 01:30:39,393
Paranoid Phil.
Now there's a blast from the past.

979
01:30:39,644 --> 01:30:44,107
In

980
01:30:44,357 --> 01:30:46,567
I was never even charged.

981
01:30:46,818 --> 01:30:50,363
Grand jury said that Nick Curran's
girlfriend did it.

982
01:30:52,824 --> 01:30:56,828
I'm going to take a Jacuzzi.
Care to join me?

983
01:31:02,792 --> 01:31:07,088
All right, all right.
I killed Johnny Boz.

984
01:31:07,338 --> 01:31:08,506
Why?

985
01:31:08,756 --> 01:31:10,883
I didn't like him.

986
01:31:11,134 --> 01:31:13,010
For the money.

987
01:31:13,261 --> 01:31:15,805
To see if I could get away with it.

988
01:31:17,515 --> 01:31:21,310
To show that death
really isn't very important.

989
01:31:21,519 --> 01:31:22,895
Because I was bored.

990
01:31:23,187 --> 01:31:25,648
And you know how I hate being bored.

991
01:31:25,898 --> 01:31:27,650
What about Denise, huh?

992
01:31:27,900 --> 01:31:29,026
Adam Towers?

993
01:31:29,277 --> 01:31:31,487
Adam was insufferable.

994
01:31:31,737 --> 01:31:33,781
And you are something special.

995
01:31:35,074 --> 01:31:39,745
Adam was trying to ruin you just
out of spite, and I couldn't bear it.

996
01:31:41,581 --> 01:31:43,249
This is wonderful.

997
01:31:49,338 --> 01:31:50,548
Denise.

998
01:31:51,132 --> 01:31:54,802
Denise... Denise was good in bed.

999
01:31:55,052 --> 01:31:58,472
Denise would have spoiled
everything I'd accomplished...

1000
01:31:58,723 --> 01:32:00,683
by killing Adam Towers.

1001
01:32:01,893 --> 01:32:05,021
God, you can't tell the truth
about anything, can you?

1002
01:32:07,190 --> 01:32:09,734
You don't believe me
when I say I did it.

1003
01:32:09,984 --> 01:32:12,904
You don't believe me
when I say I didn't do it.

1004
01:32:13,154 --> 01:32:16,157
What is the point
of talking to you, anyway?

1005
01:32:19,827 --> 01:32:21,537
Oh, come on.

1006
01:32:23,998 --> 01:32:27,001
Why don't you take your clothes off
and get in, huh?

1007
01:32:39,180 --> 01:32:42,767
This is worse than Cheslav, isn't it?

1008
01:32:43,017 --> 01:32:46,687
This time you knew
right from the start what I was.

1009
01:32:48,814 --> 01:32:52,109
And you let it happen again,
didn't you?

1010
01:32:53,694 --> 01:32:57,114
It's almost like you
killed them yourself.

1011
01:33:05,915 --> 01:33:08,751
Who do you think
I'm going to kill next?

1012
01:33:14,131 --> 01:33:15,841
Come on.

1013
01:33:16,092 --> 01:33:18,761
You can figure it out.

1014
01:35:10,456 --> 01:35:14,168
<i>Kelly met the analyst during her little
stay at Holloway Prison.</i>

1015
01:35:15,544 --> 01:35:18,839
<i>His eyes were
a beautiful shade of blue.</i>

1016
01:35:19,048 --> 01:35:21,509
<i>Did Kelly trust the doctor?</i>

1017
01:35:21,717 --> 01:35:24,887
<i>Did she mean it
when she told him she wanted help?</i>

1018
01:35:25,137 --> 01:35:27,098
<i>Even she wasn't sure.</i>

1019
01:35:27,348 --> 01:35:29,892
<i>If things went well,
then she meant it.</i>

1020
01:35:30,142 --> 01:35:31,560
<i>If not, she didn't.</i>

1021
01:35:31,811 --> 01:35:33,562
<i>That way, she'd be protected.</i>

1022
01:35:33,813 --> 01:35:35,773
<i>She remembered the first time
she met Irena...</i>

1023
01:35:36,023 --> 01:35:37,358
<i>at the party in Bloomsbury.</i>

1024
01:35:37,608 --> 01:35:39,652
<i>She felt a deep affinity
for the older woman.</i>

1025
01:35:39,902 --> 01:35:43,030
<i>As if the two of them leaning against
the wall, silently smoking...</i>

1026
01:35:43,280 --> 01:35:45,157
<i>The next time they saw each other...</i>

1027
01:35:45,366 --> 01:35:47,660
<i>only brought
the two women even closer.</i>

1028
01:35:47,910 --> 01:35:50,204
<i>Even as Dr. Green watched them
through the window...</i>

1029
01:35:50,454 --> 01:35:52,623
<i>looking for any sign of conspiracy.</i>

1030
01:35:52,873 --> 01:35:56,127
<i>Kelly found herself opening up,
trusting the older woman...</i>

1031
01:35:56,377 --> 01:35:58,462
<i>revealing things about herself...</i>

1032
01:35:58,712 --> 01:36:01,048
<i>Yes, Kelly thought. She liked Irena.</i>

1033
01:36:01,298 --> 01:36:05,803
<i>She was trustworthy, intelligent,
beautiful, dignified.</i>

1034
01:36:06,053 --> 01:36:10,433
<i>It was a pity
Kelly was going to have to kill her.</i>

1035
01:36:25,364 --> 01:36:27,199
<i>She dressed carefully.</i>

1036
01:36:27,408 --> 01:36:30,911
<i>She liked to be well-dressed
when she killed.</i>

1037
01:36:31,162 --> 01:36:34,874
<i>Killing Irena and telling Dr. Green
she was planning to do</i> it...

1038
01:36:35,124 --> 01:36:38,085
<i>that was the riskiest thing
she could do.</i>

1039
01:36:40,421 --> 01:36:41,964
Come on, Milena.

1040
01:36:46,177 --> 01:36:48,345
Come on, Milena, answer the phone

1041
01:36:50,181 --> 01:36:54,351
<i>It's Michael Glass here. Can you call
me as soon as you get this message?</i>

1042
01:36:55,853 --> 01:36:58,314
<i>As much as Kelly hated her shrink...</i>

1043
01:36:58,564 --> 01:37:01,358
<i>she also loved him.</i>

1044
01:37:01,567 --> 01:37:05,404
<i>She took a last glance at herself
in the mirror.</i>

1045
01:37:05,654 --> 01:37:10,451
<i>Irena deserved a good death.
And Kelly would give it to her.</i>

1046
01:37:10,701 --> 01:37:13,746
<i>Hello, this is Roy Washburn,
please leave a message.</i>

1047
01:37:13,954 --> 01:37:17,333
Roy. It's Michael Glass.
Come as soon as you can.

1048
01:37:17,583 --> 01:37:21,045
Hi

1049
01:37:21,295 --> 01:37:25,424
I think Catherine is going to kill
Milena Gardosh.

1050
01:37:32,264 --> 01:37:37,394
<i>It was almost midnight by the time
Dr. Green got to Hampstead.</i>

1051
01:37:53,744 --> 01:37:54,744
What is it?

1052
01:37:54,912 --> 01:37:57,831
Thank God.
Listen, we don't have much time.

1053
01:37:58,082 --> 01:38:00,793
You're in danger.
She's going to try and kill you.

1054
01:38:01,001 --> 01:38:03,087
What? Who's trying to kill me?

1055
01:38:03,546 --> 01:38:04,672
Catherine.

1056
01:38:09,051 --> 01:38:11,512
I thought I could help her
but I was wrong.

1057
01:38:11,762 --> 01:38:15,474
I'll try and get her sectioned.
It's the only thing that'll stop her.

1058
01:38:16,725 --> 01:38:18,769
I've already spoken to Catherine.

1059
01:38:22,940 --> 01:38:25,609
She's very upset. You terrified her.

1060
01:38:27,194 --> 01:38:31,282
I terrified her? She's a murderer.
She's already admitted it.

1061
01:38:31,532 --> 01:38:34,159
Fr r

1062
01:38:34,410 --> 01:38:36,662
You assaulted her.
She nearly drowned.

1063
01:38:38,914 --> 01:38:42,876
You've broken the law, not to mention
the ethical canon of our profession.

1064
01:38:43,168 --> 01:38:44,169
It wasn't like that.

1065
01:38:44,420 --> 01:38:46,505
Michael, listen to me, please.

1066
01:38:46,755 --> 01:38:48,549
You're not well.

1067
01:38:49,842 --> 01:38:51,552
You're the one who needs help.

1068
01:38:56,140 --> 01:38:57,891
...

1069
01:38:58,142 --> 01:39:02,730
and he thinks that if you volunteer
for a 28-day observation...

1070
01:39:02,938 --> 01:39:05,899
you might be able to avoid
criminal charges.

1071
01:39:07,192 --> 01:39:11,655
However, they will have to
revoke your license.

1072
01:39:12,740 --> 01:39:13,741
I'm sorry.

1073
01:39:14,908 --> 01:39:16,243
She's right.

1074
01:39:16,744 --> 01:39:19,204
It's for your own good, Michael.

1075
01:39:24,752 --> 01:39:27,379
She asked me
to take over her treatment.

1076
01:39:28,797 --> 01:39:30,716
She's my patient now.

1077
01:39:33,177 --> 01:39:34,511
Please, don't.

1078
01:39:38,390 --> 01:39:40,809
You've no idea what
you're getting into.

1079
01:39:42,645 --> 01:39:44,021
Tell her the truth.

1080
01:39:46,649 --> 01:39:48,025
Tell her the truth.

1081
01:39:50,235 --> 01:39:51,654
I'll make you tell her the truth.

1082
01:39:57,284 --> 01:39:58,284
God.

1083
01:39:59,870 --> 01:40:00,870
Come on.

1084
01:40:07,503 --> 01:40:09,838
She's right, you know.

1085
01:40:10,089 --> 01:40:12,800
You really do need help.

1086
01:40:18,931 --> 01:40:19,973
Bitch.

1087
01:40:25,604 --> 01:40:27,272
So, what's this about?

1088
01:40:29,566 --> 01:40:30,693
Protection.

1089
01:40:31,151 --> 01:40:32,986
Oh, yeah? From who?

1090
01:40:35,781 --> 01:40:37,116
Washburn.

1091
01:40:41,495 --> 01:40:42,746
Go ahead.

1092
01:40:47,710 --> 01:40:51,296
Kelly Lash kills Irena,
Dr. Green's colleague.

1093
01:40:51,547 --> 01:40:53,507
No, I read your book.

1094
01:40:53,716 --> 01:40:57,344
So you just rushed right over here
to save her?

1095
01:40:57,594 --> 01:41:01,849
It's just a story, doctor.
Or maybe I really am omnipotent.

1096
01:41:04,184 --> 01:41:09,440
Congratulations,
the control freak finally lets go.

1097
01:41:09,690 --> 01:41:13,569
This is what you wanted from the start,
wasn't it? To ruin me, to fuck me up!

1098
01:41:14,903 --> 01:41:16,905
Feels good, doesn't it?

1099
01:41:19,116 --> 01:41:24,538
No more "I should've stopped Cheslav
from killing his girlfriend."

1100
01:41:24,788 --> 01:41:28,000
No more whining over nothing.

1101
01:41:28,417 --> 01:41:31,086
- It wasn't over nothing.
- Yes, it was.

1102
01:41:31,336 --> 01:41:34,423
Cheslav did not kill his girlfriend.

1103
01:41:35,549 --> 01:41:37,217
Washburn did.

1104
01:41:39,136 --> 01:41:40,304
Washburn?

1105
01:41:40,554 --> 01:41:44,516
What do you think Adam Towers was
writing about when he was killed?

1106
01:41:45,058 --> 01:41:49,313
You're lying.
You're a lying fucking bitch.

1107
01:41:49,563 --> 01:41:53,066
Sure I am,
if it makes it easier for you.

1108
01:41:54,693 --> 01:41:58,614
Why? Why would he kill
the girlfriend?

1109
01:42:01,074 --> 01:42:03,076
T nail

1110
01:42:13,962 --> 01:42:15,506
That's right.

1111
01:42:16,924 --> 01:42:18,801
Your seven years of hell.

1112
01:42:20,093 --> 01:42:21,845
Your meltdown.

1113
01:42:22,095 --> 01:42:23,764
Your divorce.

1114
01:42:25,349 --> 01:42:30,145
Just so your good friend Roy
could nail a drug dealer.

1115
01:42:40,781 --> 01:42:42,449
Don't take it so hard.

1116
01:42:42,699 --> 01:42:46,161
Even Oedipus
didn't see his mother coming.

1117
01:42:53,627 --> 01:42:55,754
It's Roy Washburn.

1118
01:42:57,673 --> 01:43:00,092
Give me the gun. Give me the gun!

1119
01:43:00,509 --> 01:43:01,760
Fuck off!

1120
01:43:02,010 --> 01:43:06,473
Give me the gun! He knows I've got
Towers' notes. He wants me dead.

1121
01:43:06,723 --> 01:43:08,600
Open the door!

1122
01:43:08,851 --> 01:43:11,270
He's going to kill me
and say you did it.

1123
01:43:11,895 --> 01:43:15,399
No. No, this is all fucked up.

1124
01:43:15,649 --> 01:43:19,695
You don't know what you're doing.
Give me the gun. He's going to kill me.

1125
01:43:19,945 --> 01:43:21,238
You...!

1126
01:43:25,284 --> 01:43:26,952
Go ahead, then, baby.

1127
01:43:43,051 --> 01:43:45,846
Whatever she told you, she's lying.

1128
01:43:48,932 --> 01:43:50,350
Kill her!

1129
01:43:50,601 --> 01:43:53,061
It's the only chance you've got.

1130
01:44:29,473 --> 01:44:31,058
Let go of the gun!

1131
01:44:31,308 --> 01:44:32,684
Clear the weapon!

1132
01:44:32,935 --> 01:44:35,228
- Stay still!
- Get off me!

1133
01:44:35,479 --> 01:44:38,023
Stop struggling! Stop struggling!

1134
01:44:38,273 --> 01:44:42,277
Stay down! I'm telling you
to stay down. Okay?! Stay down!

1135
01:44:42,736 --> 01:44:44,196
Get the cuffs on him.

1136
01:44:45,614 --> 01:44:47,324
- Call an ambulance!
- Keep still!

1137
01:44:47,574 --> 01:44:49,576
Call an ambulance!

1138
01:45:00,587 --> 01:45:02,089
Stay down!

1139
01:45:30,617 --> 01:45:33,078
Calm down! Calm down!

1140
01:45:33,328 --> 01:45:35,038
Nighttime! Nighttime!

1141
01:45:35,288 --> 01:45:36,915
You'll be home soon.

1142
01:46:03,650 --> 01:46:05,068
Hello, Michael.

1143
01:46:11,074 --> 01:46:12,909
I brought you a present.

1144
01:46:15,537 --> 01:46:19,875
I know you read an earlier draft.
But you gave me a better ending.

1145
01:46:21,877 --> 01:46:22,878
So, thank you.

1146
01:46:35,265 --> 01:46:37,768
Would you like me to tell you the plot?

1147
01:46:43,023 --> 01:46:44,941
It's about an American.

1148
01:46:46,234 --> 01:46:47,527
A blond.

1149
01:46:47,778 --> 01:46:49,404
A novelist.

1150
01:46:49,654 --> 01:46:52,657
People around her just keep dying.

1151
01:46:52,908 --> 01:46:54,493
But the question is:

1152
01:46:54,743 --> 01:46:56,286
Who's killing them?

1153
01:46:57,913 --> 01:47:02,542
Is the beautiful blond novelist
a serial killer?

1154
01:47:04,294 --> 01:47:06,546
Or is it the crooked cop?

1155
01:47:07,923 --> 01:47:09,549
Her analyst isn't sure.

1156
01:47:09,966 --> 01:47:13,386
But he goes crazy trying to find out.

1157
01:47:14,638 --> 01:47:16,723
But that's just half the story.

1158
01:47:16,973 --> 01:47:18,266
There's a twist.

1159
01:47:20,477 --> 01:47:25,315
You see, the novelist
never really killed anybody.

1160
01:47:25,565 --> 01:47:27,901
And neither did the cop.

1161
01:47:28,151 --> 01:47:31,154
The real killer all along...

1162
01:47:31,404 --> 01:47:33,115
was the shrink.

1163
01:47:49,005 --> 01:47:52,092
Yeah, from the moment he saw her...

1164
01:47:52,342 --> 01:47:56,680
he knew she was the smoke screen
he was looking for.

1165
01:48:00,600 --> 01:48:03,395
<i>His best opportunity to get even.</i>

1166
01:48:06,398 --> 01:48:07,524
First...

1167
01:48:08,775 --> 01:48:12,904
he'd deal with that scumbag
journalist.

1168
01:48:15,073 --> 01:48:19,244
<i>You see, you don't just go around
stealing another man's wife.</i>

1169
01:48:22,622 --> 01:48:24,040
It's humiliating.

1170
01:48:31,131 --> 01:48:34,092
Not that she was a complete innocent.

1171
01:48:34,342 --> 01:48:36,178
That weekend slut.

1172
01:48:38,430 --> 01:48:43,518
<i>Jesus, how could she
let that sleazebag touch her?</i>

1173
01:48:49,774 --> 01:48:51,067
It's hurtful.

1174
01:48:53,028 --> 01:48:56,281
And there's some hurts
you don't just get over.

1175
01:49:01,536 --> 01:49:02,787
Jealousy.

1176
01:49:06,833 --> 01:49:10,003
Jealousy can make us do crazy things.

1177
01:49:19,930 --> 01:49:21,973
But getting away with it...

1178
01:49:25,727 --> 01:49:27,854
that was genius.

1179
01:49:30,148 --> 01:49:32,651
<i>"Unfit to stand trial."</i>

1180
01:49:34,110 --> 01:49:37,113
No prison for him,
just a happy ending...

1181
01:49:37,530 --> 01:49:42,869
in a quiet, sunlit, peaceful
psychiatric institute.

1182
01:49:50,669 --> 01:49:54,589
Of course, that could all be a fiction.

1183
01:49:57,217 --> 01:49:59,803
He might really be insane.

1184
01:50:33,420 --> 01:50:35,255
Come back soon, baby.

1185
01:50:37,716 --> 01:50:39,259
I miss you.
