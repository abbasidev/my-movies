00:03:19,190 --> 00:03:20,440
Hello.

2
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:24,070
My name's Forrest. Forrest Gump.

3
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:31,660
Do you want a chocolate?

4
00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:37,670
I could eat about
a million and a half of these.

5
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:44,050
My mama always said life
was like a box of chocolates.

6
00:03:46,050 --> 00:03:48,930
You never know what you're gonna get.

7
00:03:56,150 --> 00:03:58,690
Those must be comfortable shoes.

8
00:04:00,070 --> 00:04:04,740
I'll bet you could walk all day
in shoes like that and not feel a thing.

9
00:04:06,950 --> 00:04:09,410
I wish I had shoes like that.

10
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,620
My feet hurt.

11
00:04:12,830 --> 00:04:14,500
Mama always said there's an awful lot

12
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:17,790
you could tell about a person
by their shoes:

13
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:21,880
where they're going,
where they've been.

14
00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:31,180
I've worn lots of shoes.

15
00:04:34,310 --> 00:04:39,110
I bet if I think about it real hard,
I could remember my first pair of shoes.

16
00:04:42,030 --> 00:04:44,650
Mama said they'd take me anywhere.

17
00:04:45,450 --> 00:04:48,070
<i>She said they was my magic shoes.</i>

18
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:51,330
All right, Forrest,
you can open your eyes now.

19
00:04:58,630 --> 00:05:01,090
Let's take a little walk around.

20
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:09,680
How do those feel?

21
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:14,810
His legs are strong, Mrs. Gump,

22
00:05:14,890 --> 00:05:17,390
as strong as I've ever seen,

23
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:20,860
but his back is as crooked as a politician.

24
00:05:22,150 --> 00:05:25,240
But we're gonna straighten him right up,
now, aren't we, Forrest?

25
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:26,450
Forrest!

26
00:05:27,950 --> 00:05:29,160
<i>Now, when I was a baby,</i>

27
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:32,080
<i>Mama named me after the great
Civil War hero,</i>

28
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:34,580
<i>General Nathan Bedford Forrest.</i>

29
00:05:34,660 --> 00:05:36,870
<i>She said we was related to him in some way.</i>

30
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:38,330
<i>And what he did was,</i>

31
00:05:38,420 --> 00:05:42,670
<i>he started up this club called
the Ku KIux KIan.</i>

32
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:46,090
<i>They'd all dress up in their robes
and their bed sheets</i>

33
00:05:46,170 --> 00:05:50,510
<i>and act like a bunch of ghosts
or spooks or something.</i>

34
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:54,470
<i>They'd even put bed sheets
on their horses and ride around.</i>

35
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:57,600
<i>And anyway, that's how I got my name,</i>

36
00:05:57,690 --> 00:05:59,100
<i>Forrest Gump.</i>

37
00:05:59,190 --> 00:06:00,940
<i>Mama said that the "Forrest" part</i>

38
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:04,570
<i>was to remind me that sometimes
we all do things that,</i>

39
00:06:04,650 --> 00:06:07,440
<i>well, just don't make no sense.</i>

40
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:16,620
Okay... Get it, get it...

41
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:19,670
Wait, is it this way? Hold on.

42
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:22,080
All right...

43
00:06:22,670 --> 00:06:24,340
What are you all staring at?

44
00:06:24,420 --> 00:06:28,880
Haven't you ever seen a little boy
with braces on his legs before?

45
00:06:30,430 --> 00:06:34,140
Don't ever let anybody tell you
they're better than you, Forrest.

46
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:36,810
If God intended everybody
to be the same,

47
00:06:36,890 --> 00:06:39,020
he'd have given us all braces on our legs.

48
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:42,900
<i>Mama always had a way of explaining things
so I could understand them.</i>

49
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:47,860
<i>We lived about a quarter mile off Route 17,</i>

50
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:50,990
<i>about a half mile
from the town of Greenbow, Alabama.</i>

51
00:06:51,070 --> 00:06:53,820
<i>That's in the county of Greenbow.</i>

52
00:06:53,910 --> 00:06:58,330
<i>Our house had been in Mama's family
since her grandpa's grandpa's grandpa</i>

53
00:06:58,410 --> 00:07:00,330
<i>had come across the ocean
about 1,000 years ago,</i>

54
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:02,330
<i>something like that.</i>

55
00:07:02,420 --> 00:07:05,130
<i>Since it was just me and Mama
and we had all these empty rooms,</i>

56
00:07:05,210 --> 00:07:07,960
<i>Mama decided to let those rooms out,</i>

57
00:07:08,050 --> 00:07:10,010
<i>mostly to people passing through,</i>

58
00:07:10,090 --> 00:07:14,050
<i>like from, oh, Mobile, Montgomery,
places like that.</i>

59
00:07:14,140 --> 00:07:16,850
<i>That's how me and Mama got money.</i>

60
00:07:16,930 --> 00:07:19,680
<i>Mama was a real smart lady.</i>

61
00:07:19,770 --> 00:07:24,770
Remember what I told you, Forrest.
You're no different than anybody else is.

62
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,650
Did you hear what I said, Forrest?

63
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:33,910
You're the same as everybody else.
You are no different.

64
00:07:34,410 --> 00:07:38,870
Your boy's different, Mrs. Gump.

65
00:07:38,950 --> 00:07:41,160
Now, his IQ is 75.

66
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:45,080
Well, we're all different, Mr. Hancock.

67
00:07:48,670 --> 00:07:50,710
<i>She wanted me to have
the finest education,</i>

68
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:54,720
<i>so she took me to the
Greenbow County Central School.</i>

69
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:57,050
<i>I met the principal and all.</i>

70
00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:00,430
I want to show you something, Mrs. Gump.

71
00:08:00,890 --> 00:08:03,770
Now, this is normal.

72
00:08:04,270 --> 00:08:07,560
Forrest is right here.

73
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:13,950
The state requires a minimum IQ of 80
to attend public school, Mrs. Gump.

74
00:08:14,450 --> 00:08:17,320
He's gonna have to go
to a special school.

75
00:08:17,410 --> 00:08:19,530
Now, he'll be just fine.

76
00:08:20,330 --> 00:08:22,410
What does "normal" mean, anyway?

77
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:25,870
He might be a bit on the slow side,

78
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,750
but my boy Forrest is gonna get

79
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:31,380
the same opportunities
as everyone else.

80
00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:35,260
He's not going to some special school
to learn how to re-tread tires.

81
00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:38,510
We're talking about
five little points here.

82
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:42,850
There must be something can be done.

83
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:46,900
We're a progressive school system.

84
00:08:47,730 --> 00:08:50,650
We don't want to see anybody left behind.

85
00:08:51,530 --> 00:08:54,990
Is there a Mr. Gump, Mrs. Gump?

86
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:00,120
He's on vacation.

87
00:09:17,590 --> 00:09:21,390
Well, your mama sure does care
about your schooling, son.

88
00:09:26,890 --> 00:09:29,350
You don't say much, do you?

89
00:09:40,870 --> 00:09:42,830
"Finally, he had to try.

90
00:09:42,910 --> 00:09:44,870
"It looked easy, but,

91
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:48,420
"oh, what happened.

92
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:51,500
- "First, there..."
- Mama, what's "vacation" mean?

93
00:09:52,050 --> 00:09:54,630
- Vacation?
- Where Daddy went.

94
00:09:57,260 --> 00:09:59,970
Vacation's when you go somewhere

95
00:10:02,350 --> 00:10:04,680
and you don't ever come back.

96
00:10:09,020 --> 00:10:12,810
<i>Anyway, I guess you could say
me and Mama was on our own.</i>

97
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:17,650
<i>But we didn't mind.
Our house was never empty.</i>

98
00:10:17,740 --> 00:10:20,320
<i>There was always folks coming and going.</i>

99
00:10:20,410 --> 00:10:21,490
Supper.

100
00:10:21,570 --> 00:10:24,990
- It's supper, everyone. Forrest...
- My, my. That sure looks special.

101
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:27,620
<i>Sometimes we had so many people
staying with us</i>

102
00:10:27,710 --> 00:10:30,370
<i>that every room
was filled with travelers.</i>

103
00:10:30,460 --> 00:10:34,090
<i>You know, folks living out
of their suitcases</i>

104
00:10:34,170 --> 00:10:37,130
<i>and hat cases and sample cases.</i>

105
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:40,630
Forrest Gump, it's suppertime!
Forrest...

106
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:43,260
<i>One time, a young man
was staying with us,</i>

107
00:10:43,350 --> 00:10:46,970
<i>and he had him a guitar case.</i>

108
00:11:00,950 --> 00:11:04,950
Forrest! I told you not to bother
this nice young man.

109
00:11:05,030 --> 00:11:06,370
Oh, no, that's all right, ma'am.

110
00:11:06,450 --> 00:11:09,290
I was just showing him a thing or two
on the guitar here.

111
00:11:09,370 --> 00:11:12,330
All right, but your supper's ready
if y'all want to eat.

112
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:15,380
Yeah, that sounds good.
Thank you, ma'am.

113
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:19,630
Say, man, show me that crazy little walk
you just did there.

114
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:21,590
Slow it down some.

115
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:25,640
<i>I liked that guitar.</i>

116
00:11:26,310 --> 00:11:28,060
<i>It sounded good.</i>

117
00:11:29,850 --> 00:11:34,020
<i>I started moving around to the music,</i>

118
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:35,940
<i>swinging my hips.</i>

119
00:11:38,530 --> 00:11:41,070
<i>This one night,
me and Mama was out shopping,</i>

120
00:11:41,150 --> 00:11:44,160
<i>and we walked right by
Benson's furniture and appliance store,</i>

121
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:45,820
<i>and guess what?</i>

122
00:11:58,170 --> 00:12:01,010
This is not for children's eyes.

123
00:12:03,550 --> 00:12:05,340
<i>Some years later,
that handsome young man</i>

124
00:12:05,430 --> 00:12:07,970
<i>who they called "The King,"</i>

125
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:10,390
<i>well, he'd sung too many songs,</i>

126
00:12:11,060 --> 00:12:13,600
<i>had himself a heart attack, or something.</i>

127
00:12:14,690 --> 00:12:16,860
Must be hard being a king.

128
00:12:21,150 --> 00:12:23,990
You know, it's funny how you remember some things,
but some things you can't.

129
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:28,620
- You do your very best now, Forrest.
- I sure will, Mama.

130
00:12:30,330 --> 00:12:34,920
<i>I remember the bus ride
on the first day of school very well.</i>

131
00:12:38,460 --> 00:12:40,170
Are you coming along?

132
00:12:40,250 --> 00:12:43,760
Mama said not to be taking rides from strangers.

133
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:46,010
This is the bus to school.

134
00:12:48,970 --> 00:12:51,220
I'm Forrest. Forrest Gump.

135
00:12:52,180 --> 00:12:56,190
- I'm Dorothy Harris.
- Well, now we ain't strangers anymore.

136
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:10,990
This seat's taken.

137
00:13:13,450 --> 00:13:14,960
It's taken!

138
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:24,710
You can't sit here.

139
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:30,300
<i>You know, it's funny what
a young man recollects,</i>

140
00:13:30,390 --> 00:13:32,760
<i>'cause I don't remember being born.</i>

141
00:13:34,390 --> 00:13:36,560
I don't recall what I got
for my first Christmas,

142
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:39,730
and I don't know when I went
on my first outdoor picnic.

143
00:13:39,810 --> 00:13:44,530
But I do remember the first time I heard

144
00:13:44,610 --> 00:13:47,450
the sweetest voice in the wide world.

145
00:13:47,950 --> 00:13:50,320
You can sit here if you want.

146
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:57,120
<i>I had never seen anything
so beautiful in my life.</i>

147
00:13:57,830 --> 00:13:59,920
<i>She was like an angel.</i>

148
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,920
Well, are you gonna sit down,
or aren't you?

149
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:09,680
What's wrong with your legs?

150
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:14,010
Nothing at all, thank you.
My legs are just fine and dandy.

151
00:14:14,930 --> 00:14:17,100
<i>I just sat next to her on that bus</i>

152
00:14:17,180 --> 00:14:19,270
<i>and had a conversation
all the way to school.</i>

153
00:14:19,350 --> 00:14:22,060
...my back's crooked like a question mark.

154
00:14:22,150 --> 00:14:23,320
These are going to make me...

155
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:28,150
<i>And next to Mama, no one ever
talked to me or asked me questions.</i>

156
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:30,660
Are you stupid or something?

157
00:14:30,740 --> 00:14:33,740
Mama says, "Stupid is as stupid does."

158
00:14:35,370 --> 00:14:39,040
- I'm Jenny.
- I'm Forrest. Forrest Gump.

159
00:14:39,710 --> 00:14:41,540
<i>From that day on,
we was always together.</i>

160
00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:44,460
<i>Jenny and me was like peas and carrots.</i>

161
00:14:48,050 --> 00:14:49,670
<i>She taught me how to climb.</i>

162
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:52,470
Come on, Forrest, you can do it.

163
00:14:52,550 --> 00:14:55,180
<i>I showed her how to dangle.</i>

164
00:14:55,260 --> 00:14:57,310
"...a good little monkey and..."

165
00:14:57,390 --> 00:15:02,310
<i>She helped me learn how to read,
and I showed her how to swing.</i>

166
00:15:04,650 --> 00:15:08,400
<i>Sometimes we'd just sit out
and wait for the stars.</i>

167
00:15:08,490 --> 00:15:13,410
- Mama's gonna worry about me.
- Just stay a little longer.

168
00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:18,410
<i>For some reason,
Jenny didn't never want to go home.</i>

169
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:20,580
Okay, Jenny, I'll stay.

170
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:24,170
<i>She was my most special friend.</i>

171
00:15:27,590 --> 00:15:29,260
My only friend.

172
00:15:33,050 --> 00:15:36,850
Now, my mama always told me
that miracles happen every day.

173
00:15:36,930 --> 00:15:39,310
Some people don't think so, but they do.

174
00:15:42,350 --> 00:15:43,940
Hey, dummy!

175
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:46,980
Are you retarded, or just plain stupid?

176
00:15:47,070 --> 00:15:50,570
- "Look, I'm Forrest Gimp."
- Just run away, Forrest.

177
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:54,990
Run, Forrest! Run away! Hurry!

178
00:15:55,070 --> 00:15:58,330
- Get the bikes!
- Hurry up! Let's get him!

179
00:15:58,410 --> 00:16:00,950
- Come on!
- Look out, dummy, here we come!

180
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:02,870
We're gonna get you!

181
00:16:03,830 --> 00:16:07,590
Run, Forrest, run! Run, Forrest!

182
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:11,210
Come back here, you!

183
00:16:24,850 --> 00:16:27,310
Run, Forrest!

184
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:28,820
Run!

185
00:17:00,010 --> 00:17:02,890
<i>Now, you wouldn't believe it
if I told you,</i>

186
00:17:04,020 --> 00:17:06,520
but I can run like the wind blows.

187
00:17:09,770 --> 00:17:12,860
From that day on,
if I was going somewhere,

188
00:17:13,690 --> 00:17:14,990
I was running!

189
00:17:15,070 --> 00:17:17,450
He's getting away! Stop him!

190
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:51,900
That boy sure is a running fool.

191
00:17:56,110 --> 00:17:57,490
<i>Now, remember how I told you that</i>

192
00:17:57,570 --> 00:18:00,490
<i>Jenny never seemed
to want to go home?</i>

193
00:18:00,570 --> 00:18:03,660
<i>Well, she lived in a house
that was as old as Alabama.</i>

194
00:18:03,740 --> 00:18:05,910
<i>Her mama had gone up to heaven
when she was five,</i>

195
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,330
<i>and her daddy was
some kind of a farmer.</i>

196
00:18:11,170 --> 00:18:12,210
Jenny?

197
00:18:12,290 --> 00:18:14,460
<i>He was a very loving man.</i>

198
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:19,180
<i>He was always kissing and touching
her and her sisters.</i>

199
00:18:20,930 --> 00:18:25,350
<i>And then this one time,
Jenny wasn't on the bus to go to school.</i>

200
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:29,390
Jenny, why didn't you come
to school today?

201
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:31,520
Daddy's taking a nap.

202
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:33,310
- Jenny!
- Come on!

203
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:37,320
Jenny, where'd you run to?

204
00:18:38,650 --> 00:18:41,320
You'd better get back here, girl!

205
00:18:42,780 --> 00:18:44,450
Where you at?

206
00:18:47,830 --> 00:18:51,120
Jenny! Jenny! Where you at?

207
00:18:54,130 --> 00:18:55,460
Jenny!

208
00:18:55,550 --> 00:18:58,510
Pray with me, Forrest. Pray with me.

209
00:18:58,630 --> 00:18:59,760
Jenny!

210
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:03,050
Dear God, make me a bird
so I can fly far,

211
00:19:03,140 --> 00:19:04,890
far, far away from here.

212
00:19:04,970 --> 00:19:08,640
Dear God, make me a bird
so I can fly far,

213
00:19:08,730 --> 00:19:09,850
far, far away from here.

214
00:19:09,980 --> 00:19:13,020
<i>Mama always said that God is mysterious.</i>

215
00:19:13,150 --> 00:19:14,270
Jenny!

216
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:16,690
<i>He didn't turn Jenny into a bird that day.</i>

217
00:19:16,820 --> 00:19:17,900
You'd better get back here!

218
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:19,490
<i>Instead,</i>

219
00:19:20,150 --> 00:19:24,700
<i>he had the police say Jenny didn't have
to stay in that house no more.</i>

220
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:28,870
<i>She went to live with her grandma
just over on Creekmore Avenue,</i>

221
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:32,170
<i>which made me happy,
'cause she was so close.</i>

222
00:19:34,750 --> 00:19:39,800
<i>Some nights, Jenny would sneak out
and come on over to my house,</i>

223
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:43,010
<i>just 'cause she said she was scared.</i>

224
00:19:43,090 --> 00:19:45,550
<i>Scared of what, I don't know,</i>

225
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:48,890
<i>but I think it was her grandma's dog.</i>

226
00:19:49,020 --> 00:19:50,770
<i>He was a mean dog.</i>

227
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:54,230
<i>Anyway, Jenny and me was best friends</i>

228
00:19:54,310 --> 00:19:55,610
<i>all the way up through high school.</i>

229
00:19:57,570 --> 00:19:59,610
- Hey, stupid!
- Quit it!

230
00:20:00,740 --> 00:20:03,030
- Run, Forrest, run!
- Hey,

231
00:20:03,740 --> 00:20:05,200
did you hear me, stupid?

232
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:06,490
- Run, Forrest!
- Come on, get in the truck!

233
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:08,700
Get in the truck! Let's move it!

234
00:20:08,790 --> 00:20:11,540
Come on, he's getting away! Move it!

235
00:20:11,620 --> 00:20:13,790
Run, Forrest! Run!

236
00:20:13,870 --> 00:20:17,420
- You better be running, stupid!
- Come on, dummy!

237
00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:22,880
- Haul ass, dummy!
- Yeah, you better get running!

238
00:20:25,890 --> 00:20:27,550
Jack rabbit!

239
00:20:35,980 --> 00:20:37,230
Yeah!

240
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:40,230
Go! Go! Go!

241
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:43,570
Run, Forrest!

242
00:20:46,570 --> 00:20:50,160
Now, it used to be,
I ran to get where I was going,

243
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:54,250
I never thought it would take me anywhere.

244
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:27,450
- Who in the hell is that?
- That there is Forrest Gump, Coach.

245
00:21:28,450 --> 00:21:30,280
Just a local idiot.

246
00:21:30,950 --> 00:21:34,450
<i>And can you believe it?
I got to go to college, too.</i>

247
00:21:41,050 --> 00:21:43,670
Forrest! Forrest! Run!

248
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:45,380
- Okay!
- Run!

249
00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:49,010
Run, you stupid son of a bitch! Run!

250
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:04,030
You son of a bitch! Run! Go! Run!

251
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:09,160
No! Turn! Go!

252
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:24,000
He must be the stupidest
son of a bitch alive,

253
00:22:24,090 --> 00:22:26,010
but he sure is fast!

254
00:22:29,010 --> 00:22:34,010
<i>Now, maybe it's just me,
but college was very confusing times.</i>

255
00:22:35,350 --> 00:22:37,270
<i>Federal troops enforcing a court order</i>

256
00:22:37,350 --> 00:22:40,350
<i>integrated the University of Alabama today.</i>

257
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:41,650
<i>Two negroes were admitted,</i>

258
00:22:41,730 --> 00:22:45,020
<i>but only after Governor George Wallace
had carried out his symbolic threat</i>

259
00:22:45,110 --> 00:22:46,650
<i>to stand in the school house door.</i>

260
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:51,410
<i>Governor Wallace,
I take it from that statement, that...</i>

261
00:22:51,530 --> 00:22:53,530
Earl, what's going on?

262
00:22:53,620 --> 00:22:56,950
- Coons are trying to get into school.
- Coons?

263
00:22:57,040 --> 00:22:58,700
When raccoons try to get
on our back porch,

264
00:22:58,790 --> 00:23:00,580
Mama just chase them off with a broom.

265
00:23:00,710 --> 00:23:05,210
Not raccoons, you idiot, niggers,
and they want to go to school with us.

266
00:23:05,710 --> 00:23:07,760
With us? They do?

267
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:11,220
<i>Shortly after Governor Wallace
had carried out his promise</i>

268
00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:12,510
<i>to block the doorway,</i>

269
00:23:12,590 --> 00:23:14,550
<i>President Kennedy
ordered the Secretary of Defense</i>

270
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:16,640
<i>then to use military force.</i>

271
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:19,430
<i>Here, by videotape,
is the encounter by General Graham,</i>

272
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:22,810
<i>commander of the National Guard,
and Governor Wallace.</i>

273
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:26,610
<i>...because these National Guardsmen
are here today</i>

274
00:23:26,690 --> 00:23:29,240
<i>as federal soldiers for Alabamans.</i>

275
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:33,240
<i>They live within our borders,
they are all our brothers.</i>

276
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:35,740
<i>We are winning in this fight,</i>

277
00:23:35,830 --> 00:23:38,830
<i>because we are awakening
the American people</i>

278
00:23:38,910 --> 00:23:42,250
<i>to the dangers that we have spoken
about so many times,</i>

279
00:23:42,330 --> 00:23:48,630
<i>just so evident today, the trend
towards military dictatorship in this country.</i>

280
00:23:52,090 --> 00:23:54,550
<i>And so, at day's end,
the University of Alabama</i>

281
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:56,930
<i>in Tuscaloosa had been desegregated</i>

282
00:23:57,010 --> 00:24:00,020
<i>and students Jimmy Hood and Vivian Malone</i>

283
00:24:00,100 --> 00:24:03,190
<i>had been signed up for summer classes.</i>

284
00:24:05,770 --> 00:24:08,610
<i>Ma'am, you dropped your book. Ma'am...</i>

285
00:24:09,150 --> 00:24:11,110
<i>Governor Wallace did what he promised to do.</i>

286
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:14,740
<i>By being on the Tuscaloosa campus,
he kept the mob from gathering...</i>

287
00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:16,950
Say, wasn't that Gump?

288
00:24:17,030 --> 00:24:21,120
- Nah, that couldn't be.
- It sure as hell was.

289
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:27,710
<i>A few years later, that angry little man</i>

290
00:24:27,790 --> 00:24:30,300
<i>at the school house door
thought it would be a good idea</i>

291
00:24:30,380 --> 00:24:32,550
<i>and ran for president.</i>

292
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:38,300
<i>But somebody thought that it wasn't.</i>

293
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:42,060
But he didn't die.

294
00:24:46,650 --> 00:24:48,310
My bus is here.

295
00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:52,150
- Is it the number nine?
- No, it's the number four.

296
00:24:53,150 --> 00:24:55,320
It was nice talking to you.

297
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:02,330
I remember when that happened,
when Wallace got shot.

298
00:25:03,210 --> 00:25:04,660
I was in college.

299
00:25:04,750 --> 00:25:05,960
Did you go to a girls' college,

300
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:07,880
or to a girls-and-boys-together college?

301
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,000
It was co-ed.

302
00:25:09,090 --> 00:25:11,800
'Cause Jenny went to a college
I couldn't go to.

303
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:14,220
It was a college just for girls.

304
00:25:14,340 --> 00:25:17,510
<i>But I'd go and visit her
every chance I got.</i>

305
00:25:48,210 --> 00:25:49,630
That hurts.

306
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:02,810
Forrest! Forrest!

307
00:26:05,060 --> 00:26:07,980
- Forrest, stop it! Stop it!
- Jesus!

308
00:26:08,060 --> 00:26:09,190
What are you doing?

309
00:26:09,270 --> 00:26:10,940
- He was hurting you.
- What the hell is going on here?

310
00:26:11,060 --> 00:26:14,730
- No, he's not! Get over there!
- Who is that? Who is that?

311
00:26:14,820 --> 00:26:15,900
- Billy, I'm sorry.
- What the hell?

312
00:26:15,990 --> 00:26:18,570
- Just get away from me!
- Don't...

313
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:21,620
- Don't go! Billy, wait a second!
- Get away from me.

314
00:26:21,740 --> 00:26:23,910
He doesn't know any better!

315
00:26:25,660 --> 00:26:28,330
Forrest, why did you do that?

316
00:26:31,290 --> 00:26:34,250
I brought you some chocolate.

317
00:26:34,630 --> 00:26:36,340
I'm sorry.

318
00:26:38,510 --> 00:26:41,800
- I'll go back to my college now.
- Forrest...

319
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:47,100
Look at you.

320
00:26:49,190 --> 00:26:51,270
Come on. Come on.

321
00:26:58,780 --> 00:27:00,650
Is this your room?

322
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:07,370
<i>Do you ever dream, Forrest,</i>

323
00:27:08,710 --> 00:27:11,540
about who you're gonna be?

324
00:27:11,630 --> 00:27:13,420
- Who I'm gonna be?
- Yeah.

325
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:15,380
Aren't I going to be me?

326
00:27:15,460 --> 00:27:19,130
Well, you'll always be you,
just another kind of you.

327
00:27:20,050 --> 00:27:23,300
You know? I want to be famous.

328
00:27:25,010 --> 00:27:27,810
I want to be a singer like Joan Baez.

329
00:27:29,020 --> 00:27:32,140
I just want to be on an empty stage

330
00:27:32,230 --> 00:27:34,520
with my guitar, my voice.

331
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:37,820
Just me.

332
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:42,660
And I want to reach people
on the personal level.

333
00:27:45,330 --> 00:27:48,660
I want to be able to say things,
just one-to-one.

334
00:27:56,170 --> 00:27:59,050
Have you ever been with a girl, Forrest?

335
00:28:00,510 --> 00:28:04,340
I sit next to them
in my Home Economics class all the time.

336
00:28:33,290 --> 00:28:35,710
- I'm... Sorry.
- It's okay.

337
00:28:44,260 --> 00:28:45,970
It's all right.

338
00:28:48,810 --> 00:28:50,970
- It's okay.
- Oh, I'm dizzy.

339
00:28:59,650 --> 00:29:02,400
I bet that never happened in Home Ec.

340
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:08,410
No.

341
00:29:14,620 --> 00:29:17,750
I think I ruined your roommate's bathrobe.

342
00:29:17,830 --> 00:29:19,880
I don't care. I don't like her, anyway.

343
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:23,340
Run! Run! Run!

344
00:29:23,420 --> 00:29:27,930
- Run! Run! Run!
- Run! Run! Run!

345
00:29:35,850 --> 00:29:40,060
<i>College ran by real fast,
'cause I played so much football.</i>

346
00:29:40,150 --> 00:29:43,400
<i>They even put me on a thing
called the All-America Team,</i>

347
00:29:43,490 --> 00:29:47,280
<i>where you get to meet
the President of the United States.</i>

348
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:48,950
<i>President Kennedy met with the Collegiate</i>

349
00:29:49,030 --> 00:29:52,620
<i>All-American Football Team
at the Oval Office today.</i>

350
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:55,200
<i>Now, the really good thing about meeting</i>

351
00:29:55,290 --> 00:29:59,080
<i>the President of the United States
is the food.</i>

352
00:29:59,170 --> 00:30:01,880
<i>They put you in this little room
with just about anything</i>

353
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:04,460
<i>you'd want to eat or drink.</i>

354
00:30:04,970 --> 00:30:08,430
<i>And since, number one,
I wasn't hungry, but thirsty,</i>

355
00:30:08,510 --> 00:30:11,180
<i>and number two, they was free,</i>

356
00:30:11,300 --> 00:30:14,350
<i>I must have drank me about 15 Dr. Peppers.</i>

357
00:30:17,310 --> 00:30:19,440
<i>Congratulations.
How does it feel to be an All-American?</i>

358
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:21,270
<i>It's an honor, sir.</i>

359
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:23,440
<i>Congratulations.
How does it feel to be an All-American?</i>

360
00:30:23,530 --> 00:30:25,150
<i>Very good, sir.</i>

361
00:30:25,990 --> 00:30:28,400
<i>Congratulations.
How does it feel to be an All-American?</i>

362
00:30:28,490 --> 00:30:30,240
<i>Very good, sir.</i>

363
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:33,990
- <i>Congratulations. How do you feel?</i>
- <i>I gotta pee.</i>

364
00:30:34,660 --> 00:30:36,950
<i>I believe he said he had to "go pee."</i>

365
00:30:52,180 --> 00:30:55,060
<i>Sometime later,
for no particular reason,</i>

366
00:30:55,180 --> 00:30:57,560
<i>somebody shot that nice young President,</i>

367
00:30:57,680 --> 00:31:00,060
<i>when he was riding in his car.</i>

368
00:31:00,690 --> 00:31:04,820
<i>And a few years after that,
somebody shot his little brother, too,</i>

369
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:07,030
<i>only he was in a hotel kitchen.</i>

370
00:31:08,490 --> 00:31:10,900
It must be hard being brothers.

371
00:31:11,910 --> 00:31:13,120
I wouldn't know.

372
00:31:13,700 --> 00:31:15,080
<i>Forrest Gump.</i>

373
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:16,450
<i>Now can you believe it?</i>

374
00:31:16,540 --> 00:31:20,460
<i>After only five years of playing football,
I got a college degree.</i>

375
00:31:20,540 --> 00:31:22,540
Congratulations, son.

376
00:31:23,340 --> 00:31:25,380
<i>Mama was so proud.</i>

377
00:31:26,710 --> 00:31:30,550
Forrest, I'm so proud of you.
Here, I'll hold this for you.

378
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:32,760
Congratulations, son.

379
00:31:32,890 --> 00:31:35,890
Have you given any thought
to your future?

380
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:39,060
Thought?

381
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:42,350
Hello, I'm Forrest. Forrest Gump.

382
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:45,440
Nobody gives a hunk of shit
who you are, fuzzball!

383
00:31:45,570 --> 00:31:48,190
You're not even a low-life,
scum-sucking maggot!

384
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:52,240
Get your faggotty ass on the bus.
You're in the Army now!

385
00:31:52,570 --> 00:31:54,370
This seat's taken.

386
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:57,620
Taken.

387
00:32:00,540 --> 00:32:03,330
<i>At first, it seemed like I made a mistake,</i>

388
00:32:03,420 --> 00:32:05,460
<i>seeing how it was only my induction day</i>

389
00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:08,300
<i>and I was already getting yelled at.</i>

390
00:32:11,380 --> 00:32:13,630
You can sit down if you want to.

391
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:17,600
<i>I didn't know who I might meet,
or what they might ask.</i>

392
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:20,310
You ever been on a real shrimp boat?

393
00:32:20,810 --> 00:32:24,440
No, but I been on a real big boat.

394
00:32:25,230 --> 00:32:28,020
I'm talking about a shrimp-catching boat.

395
00:32:28,110 --> 00:32:30,610
I've been working on shrimp boats
all my life.

396
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:33,490
I started out on my uncle's boat,
that's my mama's brother,

397
00:32:33,610 --> 00:32:35,660
when I was about maybe nine.

398
00:32:35,780 --> 00:32:39,910
I was just looking into buying a boat of my own
and got drafted.

399
00:32:40,750 --> 00:32:45,620
My given name is Benjamin Buford Blue.
People call me Bubba.

400
00:32:46,290 --> 00:32:49,920
Just like one of them old redneck boys.
Can you believe that?

401
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:53,670
My name's Forrest Gump.
People call me Forrest Gump.

402
00:32:54,630 --> 00:32:57,050
<i>So, Bubba was from Bayou La Batre, Alabama,</i>

403
00:32:57,140 --> 00:32:59,050
<i>and his mama cooked shrimp,</i>

404
00:33:01,310 --> 00:33:04,180
<i>and her mama before her cooked shrimp,</i>

405
00:33:04,310 --> 00:33:07,270
<i>and her mama before her mama
cooked shrimp, too.</i>

406
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:08,560
<i>Bubba's family knew everything</i>

407
00:33:08,650 --> 00:33:11,280
<i>there was to know
about the shrimping business.</i>

408
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:14,400
I know everything there is to know
about the shrimping business.

409
00:33:14,490 --> 00:33:17,490
Matter of fact, I'm going into
the shrimping business for myself

410
00:33:17,620 --> 00:33:19,950
after I get out the Army.

411
00:33:22,620 --> 00:33:23,660
Okay.

412
00:33:23,870 --> 00:33:27,960
Gump! What's your sole purpose
in this Army?

413
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:30,590
To do whatever you tell me,
Drill Sergeant!

414
00:33:30,670 --> 00:33:34,050
God damn it, Gump!
You're a goddamn genius!

415
00:33:34,170 --> 00:33:36,510
That's the most outstanding answer
I've ever heard.

416
00:33:36,630 --> 00:33:39,390
You must have a goddamn IQ of 160!

417
00:33:39,510 --> 00:33:42,470
You are goddamn gifted, Private Gump!

418
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:45,350
Listen up, people!

419
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:49,650
<i>Now, for some reason, I fit in the Army
like one of them round pegs.</i>

420
00:33:49,730 --> 00:33:50,980
<i>It's not really hard.</i>

421
00:33:51,070 --> 00:33:54,690
<i>You just make your bed real neat
and remember to stand up straight,</i>

422
00:33:54,820 --> 00:33:58,780
<i>and always answer every question with,
"Yes, Drill Sergeant!"</i>

423
00:33:58,870 --> 00:34:00,320
Is that clear?

424
00:34:00,410 --> 00:34:02,530
- Yes, Drill Sergeant!
- Yes, Drill Sergeant!

425
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:06,330
What you do is, you just drag
your nets along the bottom.

426
00:34:06,410 --> 00:34:10,170
On a good day, you can catch over
100 pounds of shrimp.

427
00:34:10,250 --> 00:34:13,670
If everything goes all right,
two men shrimping 10 hours,

428
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:16,470
less what you spend on gas, you can...

429
00:34:16,550 --> 00:34:19,340
- Done, Drill Sergeant!
- Gump!

430
00:34:21,720 --> 00:34:24,470
Why did you put that weapon
together so quickly, Gump?

431
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:26,230
You told me to, Drill Sergeant.

432
00:34:26,350 --> 00:34:29,770
Jesus H. Christ, this is a new company record.

433
00:34:29,900 --> 00:34:32,360
If it wouldn't be a waste
of such a damn fine enlisted man,

434
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:34,730
I'd recommend you for OCS, Private Gump.

435
00:34:34,860 --> 00:34:36,690
You are gonna be a general some day, Gump.

436
00:34:36,780 --> 00:34:39,860
Now, disassemble your weapon and continue!

437
00:34:41,950 --> 00:34:45,740
Anyway, like I was saying,
shrimp is the fruit of the sea.

438
00:34:45,830 --> 00:34:50,580
You can barbecue it,
boil it, broil it, bake it, sauté it.

439
00:34:50,670 --> 00:34:53,670
There's shrimp kebabs, shrimp Creole...

440
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:58,800
...shrimp gumbo, pan fried,
deep fried, stir fried.

441
00:34:59,130 --> 00:35:02,680
There's pineapple shrimp, lemon shrimp,

442
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:05,100
coconut shrimp, pepper shrimp...

443
00:35:05,430 --> 00:35:11,400
...shrimp soup, shrimp stew,
shrimp salad, shrimp and potatoes,

444
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:14,520
shrimp burger, shrimp sandwich...

445
00:35:17,110 --> 00:35:19,440
That's... That's about it.

446
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:26,120
<i>Night time in the Army is a lonely time.</i>

447
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:30,620
<i>We'd lay there in our bunks
and I'd miss my mama.</i>

448
00:35:31,210 --> 00:35:33,710
<i>And I'd miss Jenny.</i>

449
00:35:37,630 --> 00:35:41,510
Hey, Gump, get a load of the tits on her!

450
00:35:54,980 --> 00:35:58,110
<i>Turns out, Jenny had gotten
into some trouble over</i>

451
00:35:58,190 --> 00:36:01,530
<i>some photos of her
in her college sweater,</i>

452
00:36:01,650 --> 00:36:04,200
<i>and she was thrown out of school.</i>

453
00:36:07,740 --> 00:36:09,950
<i>But that wasn't a bad thing,</i>

454
00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:13,620
<i>because a man who owns
a theater in Memphis, Tennessee,</i>

455
00:36:13,710 --> 00:36:18,750
<i>saw those photos and offered Jenny
a job singing in a show.</i>

456
00:36:19,550 --> 00:36:21,380
<i>The first chance I got,</i>

457
00:36:21,510 --> 00:36:25,180
<i>I took the bus up to Memphis
to see her perform in that show.</i>

458
00:36:25,260 --> 00:36:26,760
<i>That was Amber, Amber Flame.</i>

459
00:36:26,850 --> 00:36:29,310
<i>Give her a big hand, guys.
Good job, Amber.</i>

460
00:36:29,390 --> 00:36:32,140
<i>And now, for your listening
and viewing pleasure,</i>

461
00:36:32,230 --> 00:36:36,060
<i>direct from Hollywood, California,
our very own beatnik beauty,</i>

462
00:36:36,190 --> 00:36:39,860
<i>let's give a big round of applause
to the luscious Bobbi Dylan.</i>

463
00:36:42,030 --> 00:36:44,700
- All right!
- Bobbi!

464
00:37:07,220 --> 00:37:09,300
<i>Her dream had come true.</i>

465
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:12,560
<i>She was a folk singer.</i>

466
00:37:21,820 --> 00:37:24,070
Come on, baby. Shake it up.
Shake it up, now.

467
00:37:24,150 --> 00:37:25,650
Hey, buddy, get her a harmonica.

468
00:37:29,410 --> 00:37:31,450
Hey, honey, this ain't Captain Kangaroo.

469
00:37:31,580 --> 00:37:34,120
Hey, honey, I got something here for you.

470
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:38,920
- God damn it!
- Hey! Hey! Stupid jerk!

471
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,460
I'm singing a song here.

472
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:46,220
Polly, get out here!

473
00:37:46,300 --> 00:37:48,010
- Shut up, there!
- Don't be so shy, honey.

474
00:37:48,090 --> 00:37:49,640
Oh, shut up!

475
00:37:52,310 --> 00:37:55,060
Forrest, what are you doing here?

476
00:37:55,140 --> 00:37:56,850
- What are you doing?
- Hey!

477
00:37:56,940 --> 00:37:58,310
- Come on.
- What are you doing?

478
00:37:58,440 --> 00:38:00,440
Forrest, let me down!

479
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:08,200
You can't keep doing this, Forrest.

480
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:10,370
You can't keep trying
to rescue me all the time.

481
00:38:10,450 --> 00:38:14,540
- They was trying to grab you.
- A lot of people try to grab me.

482
00:38:15,460 --> 00:38:18,620
Just... You can't keep doing this
all the time.

483
00:38:19,130 --> 00:38:22,040
I can't help it. I love you.

484
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:26,510
Forrest, you don't know what love is.

485
00:38:33,810 --> 00:38:36,810
You remember that time we prayed, Forrest?

486
00:38:37,690 --> 00:38:42,190
We prayed for God to turn me
into a bird so I could fly far, far away?

487
00:38:44,150 --> 00:38:45,530
Yes, I do.

488
00:38:49,490 --> 00:38:52,320
You think I could fly off this bridge?

489
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,170
What do you mean, Jenny?

490
00:39:05,050 --> 00:39:06,550
Nothing.

491
00:39:09,510 --> 00:39:11,550
I gotta get out of here.

492
00:39:13,850 --> 00:39:14,930
Wait, Jenny...

493
00:39:15,010 --> 00:39:19,480
Forrest, you stay away from me, okay?
You just stay away from me, please.

494
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:20,850
Can I have a ride?

495
00:39:20,940 --> 00:39:22,480
- Where you going?
- I don't care.

496
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:23,940
Get in the truck.

497
00:39:24,020 --> 00:39:25,860
So, bye-bye, Jenny.

498
00:39:28,360 --> 00:39:30,700
They sending me to Vietnam.

499
00:39:33,450 --> 00:39:35,870
It's this whole other country.

500
00:39:38,370 --> 00:39:40,370
Just hang on a minute.

501
00:39:41,790 --> 00:39:44,840
Listen, you promise me something, okay?

502
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:48,260
Just, if you're ever in trouble,
don't try to be brave. You just run, okay?

503
00:39:48,380 --> 00:39:49,970
Just run away.

504
00:39:51,220 --> 00:39:52,550
Okay.

505
00:39:57,430 --> 00:39:58,770
Jenny.

506
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:02,940
I'll write you all the time.

507
00:40:12,070 --> 00:40:15,070
<i>And just like that, she was gone.</i>

508
00:40:31,170 --> 00:40:34,510
You come back safe to me,
do you hear?

509
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:21,770
<i>Now, they told us that Vietnam
was gonna be very different</i>

510
00:41:21,850 --> 00:41:24,730
<i>from the United States of America.</i>

511
00:41:24,810 --> 00:41:29,860
<i>And except for all the beer cans
and the barbecue, it was.</i>

512
00:41:39,990 --> 00:41:43,080
Hey, I bet there's shrimp
all in these waters.

513
00:41:43,160 --> 00:41:46,330
They tell me these Vietnams
is good shrimpers.

514
00:41:46,420 --> 00:41:49,960
You know, after we win this war,
and we take over everything,

515
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:51,250
we can get American shrimpers

516
00:41:51,340 --> 00:41:53,090
to come out here and shrimp these waters.

517
00:41:53,170 --> 00:41:54,710
We'll just shrimp all the time, man.

518
00:41:54,840 --> 00:41:58,010
So much shrimp, why,
you wouldn't believe it.

519
00:41:58,680 --> 00:42:00,600
You must be my FNGs.

520
00:42:00,680 --> 00:42:01,930
- Morning, sir!
- Morning, sir!

521
00:42:02,010 --> 00:42:04,640
Get your hands down!
Do not salute me.

522
00:42:04,730 --> 00:42:06,850
There's goddamn snipers
all around this area

523
00:42:06,940 --> 00:42:09,770
who would love to grease an officer.

524
00:42:09,860 --> 00:42:13,360
I'm Lieutenant Dan Taylor.
Welcome to Fourth Platoon.

525
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:16,650
What's wrong with your lip?

526
00:42:16,740 --> 00:42:19,110
I was born with big gums, sir.

527
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:23,910
Yeah, well, you better tuck that in.
Gonna get that caught on a trip wire.

528
00:42:25,080 --> 00:42:26,450
Where you boys from in the world?

529
00:42:26,540 --> 00:42:28,920
- Alabama, sir!
- Alabama, sir!

530
00:42:29,630 --> 00:42:31,130
You twins?

531
00:42:33,210 --> 00:42:35,630
No, we are not relations, sir.

532
00:42:37,880 --> 00:42:40,800
Look, it's pretty basic here.

533
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:44,060
If you stick with me
and learn from the guys

534
00:42:44,140 --> 00:42:46,810
who've been in country a while,
you'll be all right.

535
00:42:46,890 --> 00:42:48,810
There is one item of GI gear

536
00:42:48,890 --> 00:42:53,060
that can be the difference
between a live grunt and a dead grunt.

537
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:56,570
Socks. Cushion sole, OD green.

538
00:42:56,650 --> 00:42:57,940
Try and keep your feet dry.

539
00:42:58,070 --> 00:42:59,490
When we're out humping,
I want you boys to remember

540
00:42:59,570 --> 00:43:02,030
to change your socks whenever we stop.

541
00:43:02,120 --> 00:43:05,080
The Mekong will eat a grunt's feet
right off his legs.

542
00:43:05,160 --> 00:43:07,450
Sergeant Sims, God damn it,

543
00:43:07,580 --> 00:43:09,000
where is that sling rope
I told you to order?

544
00:43:09,080 --> 00:43:11,000
I put in the requisitions at Battalion.

545
00:43:11,080 --> 00:43:13,080
Yeah, yeah, yeah, well,
you call those sons of bitches again...

546
00:43:13,170 --> 00:43:18,090
<i>Lieutenant Dan sure knew his stuff.
I felt real lucky he was my lieutenant.</i>

547
00:43:18,840 --> 00:43:22,300
<i>He was from a long,
great military tradition.</i>

548
00:43:22,510 --> 00:43:25,600
<i>Somebody in his family had fought and died</i>

549
00:43:26,600 --> 00:43:30,850
<i>in every single American war.</i>

550
00:43:31,770 --> 00:43:33,770
- God damn it, kick some ass!
- I'm on it, Lieutenant.

551
00:43:33,860 --> 00:43:34,980
Get on it!

552
00:43:35,110 --> 00:43:38,440
<i>I guess you could say he had
a lot to live up to.</i>

553
00:43:40,150 --> 00:43:44,990
So, you boys are from Arkansas, huh?
Well, I've been through there.

554
00:43:45,120 --> 00:43:47,290
Little Rock's a fine town.

555
00:43:47,950 --> 00:43:51,540
Now, go shake down your gear,
see the platoon sergeant,

556
00:43:51,620 --> 00:43:54,080
draw what you need for the field.

557
00:43:54,170 --> 00:43:58,130
If you boys are hungry,
we got steaks burning right over here.

558
00:43:58,210 --> 00:44:01,090
Two standing orders in this platoon:

559
00:44:01,180 --> 00:44:03,840
one, take good care of your feet,

560
00:44:03,970 --> 00:44:09,020
two, try not to do anything stupid,
like getting yourself killed.

561
00:44:15,480 --> 00:44:17,570
I sure hope I don't let him down.

562
00:44:29,160 --> 00:44:34,080
<i>I got to see a lot of the countryside.
We would take these real long walks.</i>

563
00:44:42,550 --> 00:44:46,680
<i>And we were always looking
for this guy named Charlie.</i>

564
00:44:54,520 --> 00:44:56,770
- Hold it up!
- Hold up, boys!

565
00:44:59,610 --> 00:45:01,940
<i>It wasn't always fun.</i>

566
00:45:02,030 --> 00:45:06,320
<i>Lieutenant Dan was always getting
these funny feelings about a rock,</i>

567
00:45:06,410 --> 00:45:11,490
<i>or a trail, or the road,
so he'd tell us to get down, shut up...</i>

568
00:45:11,580 --> 00:45:13,580
Get down! Shut up!

569
00:45:14,540 --> 00:45:16,000
<i>so we did.</i>

570
00:45:33,560 --> 00:45:35,730
<i>Now, I don't know much about anything,</i>

571
00:45:35,810 --> 00:45:39,650
<i>but I think some of America's
best young men served in this war.</i>

572
00:45:39,730 --> 00:45:42,440
<i>There was Dallas, from Phoenix,</i>

573
00:45:44,150 --> 00:45:46,950
<i>Cleveland, he was from Detroit.</i>

574
00:45:47,070 --> 00:45:49,450
Hey, Tex. Hey, Tex.

575
00:45:49,580 --> 00:45:51,740
Man, what the hell's going on?

576
00:45:51,830 --> 00:45:56,160
<i>And Tex was... Well, I don't remember
where Tex come from.</i>

577
00:45:56,250 --> 00:45:57,790
Nothing.

578
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:04,420
Fourth Platoon, on your feet.

579
00:46:04,510 --> 00:46:08,220
Still got 10 klicks to go to that river.
Move out.

580
00:46:08,300 --> 00:46:10,090
Come on, move out.

581
00:46:12,140 --> 00:46:14,560
Step it up. Look alive out there.

582
00:46:14,640 --> 00:46:18,980
<i>The good thing about Vietnam
is there was always some place to go.</i>

583
00:46:19,100 --> 00:46:20,480
Fire in the hole!

584
00:46:23,940 --> 00:46:26,280
Gump, check out that hole.

585
00:46:26,360 --> 00:46:29,360
<i>And there was always something to do.</i>

586
00:46:29,450 --> 00:46:32,620
- Mount them up.
- Spread out! Cover his back.

587
00:46:37,670 --> 00:46:43,290
<i>One day, it started raining,
and it didn't quit for four months.</i>

588
00:46:44,300 --> 00:46:47,170
<i>We'd been through
every kind of rain there is:</i>

589
00:46:47,300 --> 00:46:49,840
<i>little bitty stinging rain,</i>

590
00:46:50,550 --> 00:46:53,220
<i>and big old fat rain,</i>

591
00:46:53,680 --> 00:46:56,390
<i>rain that flew in sideways.</i>

592
00:46:56,480 --> 00:47:00,520
<i>And sometimes, rain even seemed
to come straight up from underneath.</i>

593
00:47:02,310 --> 00:47:04,690
<i>Shoot, it even rained at night.</i>

594
00:47:05,730 --> 00:47:08,190
- Hey, Forrest.
- Hey, Bubba.

595
00:47:08,320 --> 00:47:11,610
I'm gonna lean up against you.
You just lean right back against me.

596
00:47:11,700 --> 00:47:15,540
This way, we don't have to sleep
with our heads in the mud.

597
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:19,960
You know why we a good partnership, Forrest?

598
00:47:20,040 --> 00:47:22,540
'Cause we be watching out for one another,

599
00:47:22,670 --> 00:47:24,540
like brothers and stuff.

600
00:47:26,510 --> 00:47:30,170
Hey, Forrest, there's something
I've been thinking about.

601
00:47:30,260 --> 00:47:33,260
I got a very important question to ask you.

602
00:47:34,890 --> 00:47:38,850
How would you like to go
into the shrimping business with me?

603
00:47:40,020 --> 00:47:41,640
Okay.

604
00:47:41,730 --> 00:47:45,190
Man, I tell you what,
I got it all figured out, too.

605
00:47:45,270 --> 00:47:48,070
So many pounds of shrimp
to pay off the boat,

606
00:47:48,190 --> 00:47:51,490
so many pounds for gas,
we can just live right on the boat.

607
00:47:51,570 --> 00:47:53,870
We ain't got to pay no rent.

608
00:47:53,950 --> 00:47:56,030
I'll be the captain,
we can just work it together,

609
00:47:56,120 --> 00:48:00,370
split everything right down the middle.
Man, I'm telling you, 50-50.

610
00:48:00,460 --> 00:48:04,040
And, hey, Forrest,
all the shrimp you can eat.

611
00:48:05,590 --> 00:48:07,380
That's a fine idea.

612
00:48:08,460 --> 00:48:10,590
<i>Bubba did have a fine idea.</i>

613
00:48:14,390 --> 00:48:17,470
<i>I even wrote Jenny
and told her all about it.</i>

614
00:48:18,270 --> 00:48:21,480
<i>I sent her letters,
not every day, but almost.</i>

615
00:48:21,560 --> 00:48:26,560
<i>I told her what I was doing
and asked her what she was doing,</i>

616
00:48:26,650 --> 00:48:29,400
<i>and told her
how I thought about her always,</i>

617
00:48:30,740 --> 00:48:33,700
<i>and how I was looking forward
to getting a letter from her</i>

618
00:48:33,780 --> 00:48:36,280
<i>just as soon as she had the time.</i>

619
00:48:38,160 --> 00:48:40,660
<i>I'd always let her know that I was okay.</i>

620
00:48:41,960 --> 00:48:47,130
<i>Then, I'd sign each letter,
"Love, Forrest Gump."</i>

621
00:49:01,980 --> 00:49:05,730
<i>This one day, we was out walking,
like always,</i>

622
00:49:05,810 --> 00:49:08,770
<i>and then, just like that,</i>

623
00:49:09,690 --> 00:49:13,110
<i>somebody turned off the rain
and the sun come out.</i>

624
00:49:16,120 --> 00:49:17,950
Ambush!

625
00:49:18,450 --> 00:49:19,830
Take cover!

626
00:49:23,460 --> 00:49:24,620
Get down!

627
00:49:24,710 --> 00:49:26,170
Get the sixty!

628
00:49:29,340 --> 00:49:31,420
Get that pig up here, God damn it!

629
00:49:31,510 --> 00:49:33,630
Forrest, you okay?

630
00:49:36,840 --> 00:49:39,470
Strongarm! Strongarm! Be advised, Strongarm!

631
00:49:40,010 --> 00:49:42,430
Medic, we got a man down!

632
00:49:42,520 --> 00:49:45,480
Strongarm, this is Leg Lima 6, over!

633
00:49:46,190 --> 00:49:49,520
Roger, Strongarm, be advised
we have incoming from the tree line

634
00:49:49,650 --> 00:49:53,150
at points blue plus two.
AKs and rockets...

635
00:49:53,820 --> 00:49:55,610
Misfire! Misfire!

636
00:49:57,990 --> 00:49:59,990
God damn it! Mac!

637
00:50:00,950 --> 00:50:04,370
Get that thing...
Fuck it, get it in the tree line!

638
00:50:05,330 --> 00:50:06,500
Jesus!

639
00:50:06,620 --> 00:50:08,830
My unit is down hard and hurting!

640
00:50:08,960 --> 00:50:12,500
Six are pulling back to Blue Line,
Leg Lima 6 out.

641
00:50:13,300 --> 00:50:15,260
Pull back! Pull back!

642
00:50:15,340 --> 00:50:17,470
Run! Run, Forrest!

643
00:50:17,550 --> 00:50:19,890
- Pull back!
- Forrest, Forrest!

644
00:50:20,010 --> 00:50:22,600
Run, man! Run!

645
00:50:22,680 --> 00:50:24,470
Pull back! Run!

646
00:50:26,310 --> 00:50:28,520
Run, God damn it, run!

647
00:50:49,710 --> 00:50:54,340
Medic! Can I get a medic?

648
00:50:54,710 --> 00:50:58,050
<i>I ran and ran, just like Jenny told me to.</i>

649
00:51:01,430 --> 00:51:05,640
<i>I ran so far and so fast
that pretty soon I was all by myself,</i>

650
00:51:05,720 --> 00:51:07,680
<i>which was a bad thing.</i>

651
00:51:08,230 --> 00:51:09,770
Bubba!

652
00:51:11,900 --> 00:51:15,690
<i>Bubba was my best good friend.
I had to make sure that he was okay.</i>

653
00:51:19,400 --> 00:51:21,450
Any friendlies out there?

654
00:51:22,410 --> 00:51:24,580
Yeah, I've got three over here.

655
00:51:25,200 --> 00:51:27,200
Where the hell are you?

656
00:51:27,790 --> 00:51:29,120
Bubba?

657
00:51:30,210 --> 00:51:32,920
<i>And on my way back to find Bubba,</i>

658
00:51:33,040 --> 00:51:35,840
<i>well, there was this boy
laying on the ground.</i>

659
00:51:35,920 --> 00:51:37,130
Tex!

660
00:51:39,220 --> 00:51:40,220
Okay.

661
00:51:40,300 --> 00:51:44,260
<i>I couldn't just let him lay there all alone,
scared the way he was,</i>

662
00:51:44,390 --> 00:51:48,270
<i>so I grabbed him up
and run him out of there.</i>

663
00:52:03,410 --> 00:52:05,830
<i>And every time I went back
looking for Bubba,</i>

664
00:52:05,950 --> 00:52:09,450
<i>somebody else was saying,
"Help me, Forrest. Help me."</i>

665
00:52:17,130 --> 00:52:19,010
Can't hear... Can't hear...

666
00:52:21,300 --> 00:52:22,590
No sweat, man. Just lay back.

667
00:52:22,680 --> 00:52:25,180
You'll be okay. You'll be okay.

668
00:52:27,180 --> 00:52:30,220
<i>I started to get scared
that I might never find Bubba.</i>

669
00:52:30,310 --> 00:52:31,560
<i>...over.</i>

670
00:52:31,640 --> 00:52:34,940
Roger, Strongarm,
I know my position is danger close.

671
00:52:35,020 --> 00:52:36,860
We got Charlie all over this area.

672
00:52:36,980 --> 00:52:39,280
I gotta have those fast movers
in here now. Over.

673
00:52:39,360 --> 00:52:42,740
- <i>Six, Strongarm, we want...</i>
- Lieutenant Dan, Coleman's dead!

674
00:52:42,820 --> 00:52:44,030
I know he's dead!

675
00:52:44,160 --> 00:52:46,990
My whole goddamn platoon is wiped out!

676
00:52:47,120 --> 00:52:48,450
- <i>Leg Lima 6, Leg Lima 6.</i>
- God damn it!

677
00:52:48,540 --> 00:52:51,250
- <i>Copy this transmission. Over.</i>
- What are you doing?

678
00:52:51,330 --> 00:52:54,670
Just leave me here! Get away.
Just leave me here! Get out!

679
00:52:54,790 --> 00:52:57,080
<i>Leg Lima 6, Strongarm.
How copy this? Over.</i>

680
00:52:57,170 --> 00:52:59,800
God, I said leave me here, God damn it!

681
00:52:59,880 --> 00:53:03,050
<i>Leg Lima 6, Leg Lima 6,
this is Strongarm, be advised</i>

682
00:53:03,180 --> 00:53:05,130
<i>your fast movers
are inbound at this time, over.</i>

683
00:53:05,220 --> 00:53:08,640
<i>Then, it felt like something
just jumped up and bit me.</i>

684
00:53:09,510 --> 00:53:11,180
Something bit me!

685
00:53:18,070 --> 00:53:20,190
You chink son of a bitch!

686
00:53:22,690 --> 00:53:24,700
I can't leave the platoon.

687
00:53:24,820 --> 00:53:29,740
I told you to leave me there, Gump.
Forget about me. Get yourself out!

688
00:53:29,870 --> 00:53:31,990
Did you hear what I said?

689
00:53:32,700 --> 00:53:34,660
God damn it, put me down!

690
00:53:35,370 --> 00:53:37,420
Get your ass out of here!

691
00:53:40,710 --> 00:53:43,300
I didn't ask you to pull me out of there,
God damn you!

692
00:53:43,380 --> 00:53:44,720
Where the hell do you think you're going?

693
00:53:44,840 --> 00:53:45,930
To get Bubba.

694
00:53:46,050 --> 00:53:49,890
I got an air strike inbound right now.
They're gonna nape the whole area.

695
00:53:50,010 --> 00:53:52,390
Gump, you stay here, God damn it!
That's an order!

696
00:53:52,520 --> 00:53:54,930
I gotta find Bubba!

697
00:54:10,910 --> 00:54:12,370
Forrest.

698
00:54:20,130 --> 00:54:22,800
- Bubba.
- I'm okay, Forrest.

699
00:54:23,590 --> 00:54:25,260
I'm okay.

700
00:54:33,100 --> 00:54:34,930
Oh, Bubba, no...

701
00:54:35,060 --> 00:54:37,270
Nah, I'm gonna be all right.

702
00:54:45,440 --> 00:54:48,110
Come on. Come on. Come on.

703
00:54:53,120 --> 00:54:54,620
I'm okay, Forrest.

704
00:54:55,950 --> 00:54:58,790
I'm okay, man. I'm fine.

705
00:55:35,830 --> 00:55:38,950
Helo's inbound.
Top smoke, get it out there!

706
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:44,500
<i>If I'd a known this was gonna be
the last time me and Bubba was gonna talk,</i>

707
00:55:44,630 --> 00:55:46,920
<i>I'd of thought of something better to say.</i>

708
00:55:47,010 --> 00:55:48,510
Hey, Bubba.

709
00:55:49,630 --> 00:55:51,010
Hey, Forrest.

710
00:55:53,350 --> 00:55:56,560
Forrest, why'd this happen?

711
00:55:57,890 --> 00:55:59,680
You got shot.

712
00:56:01,390 --> 00:56:05,560
<i>Then Bubba said something
I won't ever forget.</i>

713
00:56:06,360 --> 00:56:08,030
I wanna go home.

714
00:56:10,030 --> 00:56:12,070
<i>Bubba was my best good friend.</i>

715
00:56:13,030 --> 00:56:17,580
<i>And even I know that ain't something
you can find just around the corner.</i>

716
00:56:17,700 --> 00:56:20,790
<i>Bubba was gonna be
a shrimping boat captain,</i>

717
00:56:20,870 --> 00:56:24,830
<i>but instead he died right there
by that river in Vietnam.</i>

718
00:56:30,550 --> 00:56:32,840
That's all I have to say about that.

719
00:56:35,220 --> 00:56:37,390
It was a bullet, wasn't it?

720
00:56:39,720 --> 00:56:42,390
- A bullet?
- That jumped up and bit you.

721
00:56:44,770 --> 00:56:46,860
Oh, yes, sir.

722
00:56:46,940 --> 00:56:50,070
Bit me directly in the buttocks.

723
00:56:50,190 --> 00:56:55,450
They said it was a million-dollar wound,
but the Army must keep that money,

724
00:56:55,570 --> 00:56:59,410
'cause I still ain't seen a nickel
of that million dollars.

725
00:57:00,250 --> 00:57:03,750
The only good thing
about being wounded in the buttocks

726
00:57:03,870 --> 00:57:05,580
<i>is the ice cream.</i>

727
00:57:05,710 --> 00:57:08,290
<i>They gave me all the ice cream
I could eat.</i>

728
00:57:08,420 --> 00:57:09,710
<i>And guess what?</i>

729
00:57:09,800 --> 00:57:12,920
<i>A good friend of mine
was in the bed right next door.</i>

730
00:57:15,140 --> 00:57:18,220
Lieutenant Dan, I got you some ice cream.

731
00:57:20,600 --> 00:57:22,770
Lieutenant Dan, ice cream.

732
00:57:34,490 --> 00:57:36,780
It's time for your bath, Lieutenant.

733
00:57:45,290 --> 00:57:46,620
Harper!

734
00:57:49,840 --> 00:57:52,300
Cooper, Larson,

735
00:57:54,510 --> 00:57:55,840
Webster,

736
00:57:57,260 --> 00:58:00,760
- Gump. Gump.
- I'm Forrest Gump.

737
00:58:04,310 --> 00:58:07,600
Kyle, Nichols,

738
00:58:09,810 --> 00:58:15,780
McMill, Johnson, Tyler,

739
00:58:17,110 --> 00:58:18,490
Holiday...

740
00:58:25,250 --> 00:58:27,500
<i>Surprise, surprise, surprise!</i>

741
00:58:30,840 --> 00:58:33,340
Gump, how can you watch that stupid shit?

742
00:58:33,420 --> 00:58:35,010
- <i>From the DMZ to the Delta...</i>
- Turn it off!

743
00:58:35,090 --> 00:58:38,340
<i>you are tuned to the
American Forces Vietnam Network.</i>

744
00:58:38,470 --> 00:58:40,800
<i>This is Channel 6, Saigon.</i>

745
00:58:43,520 --> 00:58:45,180
Good catch, Gump.

746
00:58:47,140 --> 00:58:49,310
You know how to play this?

747
00:58:50,610 --> 00:58:52,690
Come on, let me show you. Here.

748
00:58:54,780 --> 00:58:57,110
Now, the secret to this game is,

749
00:58:57,200 --> 00:59:03,030
no matter what happens,
never ever take your eye off the ball.

750
00:59:06,620 --> 00:59:07,960
All right.

751
00:59:11,290 --> 00:59:14,960
<i>For some reason,
Ping-Pong came very natural to me.</i>

752
00:59:15,300 --> 00:59:18,220
See? Any idiot can play.

753
00:59:18,720 --> 00:59:21,470
<i>So, I started playing it all the time.</i>

754
00:59:22,640 --> 00:59:23,970
<i>I played Ping-Pong</i>

755
00:59:24,060 --> 00:59:27,350
<i>even when I didn't have anyone
to play Ping-Pong with.</i>

756
00:59:35,400 --> 00:59:40,070
<i>The hospital's people said
it made me look like a duck in water,</i>

757
00:59:40,200 --> 00:59:42,030
<i>whatever that means.</i>

758
00:59:42,490 --> 00:59:45,740
<i>Even Lieutenant Dan would come
and watch me play.</i>

759
00:59:51,250 --> 00:59:55,130
<i>I played Ping-Pong so much,
I even played it in my sleep.</i>

760
01:00:02,930 --> 01:00:08,020
Now, you listen to me.
We all have a destiny.

761
01:00:08,100 --> 01:00:11,140
Nothing just happens,
it's all part of a plan.

762
01:00:11,270 --> 01:00:13,940
I should have died out there
with my men,

763
01:00:14,060 --> 01:00:18,030
but now I'm nothing
but a goddamn cripple,

764
01:00:18,110 --> 01:00:21,740
a legless freak! Look! Look! Look at me!

765
01:00:22,490 --> 01:00:23,570
Do you see that?

766
01:00:23,660 --> 01:00:27,450
Do you know what it's like
not to be able to use your legs?

767
01:00:30,790 --> 01:00:32,410
Yes, sir, I do.

768
01:00:36,090 --> 01:00:38,130
Did you hear what I said?

769
01:00:39,010 --> 01:00:40,760
You cheated me.

770
01:00:40,840 --> 01:00:42,010
I had a destiny.

771
01:00:42,090 --> 01:00:45,640
I was supposed to die in the field,
with honor!

772
01:00:46,300 --> 01:00:50,350
That was my destiny,
and you cheated me out of it!

773
01:00:59,980 --> 01:01:02,690
Do you understand what I'm saying, Gump?

774
01:01:04,820 --> 01:01:08,200
This wasn't supposed to happen,
not to me.

775
01:01:10,830 --> 01:01:12,500
I had a destiny.

776
01:01:14,460 --> 01:01:18,840
I was Lieutenant Dan Taylor.

777
01:01:25,010 --> 01:01:27,340
You're still Lieutenant Dan.

778
01:01:50,580 --> 01:01:52,080
Look at me.

779
01:01:53,410 --> 01:01:55,370
What am I gonna do now?

780
01:01:59,040 --> 01:02:01,090
What am I gonna do now?

781
01:02:11,470 --> 01:02:12,930
PFC Gump?

782
01:02:14,480 --> 01:02:15,890
Yes, sir!

783
01:02:16,560 --> 01:02:18,060
As you were.

784
01:02:18,560 --> 01:02:22,400
Son, you've been awarded the Medal of Honor.

785
01:02:23,440 --> 01:02:27,070
Guess what, Lieutenant Dan,
they want to give me a...

786
01:02:33,830 --> 01:02:37,580
Ma'am, what'd they do with Lieutenant Dan?

787
01:02:38,500 --> 01:02:40,290
They sent him home.

788
01:02:46,300 --> 01:02:49,050
<i>Two weeks later, I left Vietnam.</i>

789
01:02:50,090 --> 01:02:53,640
<i>The ceremony was kicked off
with a candid speech by the President</i>

790
01:02:53,720 --> 01:02:57,100
<i>regarding the need for further escalation
of the war in Vietnam.</i>

791
01:02:57,190 --> 01:02:59,310
<i>President Johnson awarded
four Medals of Honor</i>

792
01:02:59,400 --> 01:03:01,060
<i>to men from each of the Armed Services.</i>

793
01:03:01,150 --> 01:03:04,070
<i>America owes you
a debt of gratitude, son.</i>

794
01:03:06,070 --> 01:03:09,860
<i>I understand you were wounded.
Where were you hit?</i>

795
01:03:09,950 --> 01:03:13,120
- <i>In the buttocks, sir.</i>
- <i>That must be a sight.</i>

796
01:03:13,870 --> 01:03:16,160
<i>I'd kind of like to see that.</i>

797
01:03:30,300 --> 01:03:31,760
<i>God damn, son.</i>

798
01:03:33,890 --> 01:03:37,720
<i>After that,
Mama went to the hotel to lay down,</i>

799
01:03:37,810 --> 01:03:41,310
<i>so I went out for a walk
to see our nation's capital.</i>

800
01:03:41,400 --> 01:03:44,520
Hilary, all right, I've got the vets,
what do you want me to do with them?

801
01:03:44,610 --> 01:03:46,360
What are you doing here so late?

802
01:03:46,440 --> 01:03:50,490
<i>It's a good thing Mama was resting,
'cause the streets was awful crowded</i>

803
01:03:50,570 --> 01:03:53,740
<i>with people looking
at all the statues and monuments,</i>

804
01:03:53,830 --> 01:03:56,450
<i>and some of them people
were loud and pushy.</i>

805
01:03:56,540 --> 01:03:59,500
Okay, follow me! Come on.
Let's move it out.

806
01:04:00,330 --> 01:04:03,290
<i>Everywhere I went,
I had to stand in line.</i>

807
01:04:06,550 --> 01:04:08,090
Follow me, let's go!

808
01:04:09,880 --> 01:04:11,510
Come on. Let's go.

809
01:04:17,560 --> 01:04:19,140
Stand here.

810
01:04:21,600 --> 01:04:24,770
Hey, you're a good man
for doing this. Good!

811
01:04:26,070 --> 01:04:27,190
Okay.

812
01:04:27,980 --> 01:04:31,360
<i>There was this man giving a little talk.</i>

813
01:04:31,450 --> 01:04:34,950
<i>And for some reason, he was wearing
an American flag for a shirt.</i>

814
01:04:35,030 --> 01:04:36,490
<i>Now, I'm gonna bring up some soldiers...</i>

815
01:04:36,580 --> 01:04:39,370
<i>And he liked to say the "F" word.</i>

816
01:04:39,450 --> 01:04:42,830
<i>A lot. "F" this and "F" that.</i>

817
01:04:42,920 --> 01:04:45,250
<i>And every time he said the "F" word,</i>

818
01:04:45,340 --> 01:04:48,090
<i>people, for some reason,
well, they'd cheer.</i>

819
01:04:48,170 --> 01:04:51,260
<i>...where to stick this fucking war! Yeah!</i>

820
01:04:52,300 --> 01:04:54,640
<i>Yeah! Yeah!</i>

821
01:04:55,220 --> 01:04:57,720
Come on, man, come up here, man.

822
01:04:58,140 --> 01:05:01,480
Come on. Come on. Yeah, you!
Come on. Move, move, move.

823
01:05:02,480 --> 01:05:05,900
You can do it. Just get up there.
Go on. That's it.

824
01:05:18,700 --> 01:05:21,240
<i>Tell us a little bit about the war, man.</i>

825
01:05:21,330 --> 01:05:23,080
<i>The war in Vietnam?</i>

826
01:05:23,160 --> 01:05:26,080
- <i>The war in Viet-fucking-nam!</i>
- Yeah!

827
01:05:46,440 --> 01:05:47,520
Peace!

828
01:05:47,900 --> 01:05:49,270
Come on, man, go!

829
01:05:49,570 --> 01:05:51,530
- Come on!
- Peace!

830
01:05:51,610 --> 01:05:52,650
<i>Well...</i>

831
01:05:52,740 --> 01:05:56,200
<i>There was only one thing
I could say about the war in Vietnam.</i>

832
01:05:56,280 --> 01:06:01,120
<i>there's only one thing
I can say about the war in Vietnam.</i>

833
01:06:04,910 --> 01:06:08,710
<i>In Vietnam, your...</i>

834
01:06:18,470 --> 01:06:19,550
Hey, what the hell are you...

835
01:06:19,640 --> 01:06:22,390
I'll beat your head in,
you goddamn oinker!

836
01:06:22,470 --> 01:06:24,980
Jesus Christ, what'd they do with this?

837
01:06:26,390 --> 01:06:28,060
We can't hear you!

838
01:06:29,770 --> 01:06:31,770
We can't hear anything!

839
01:06:32,480 --> 01:06:34,990
- This one! This one! Give me that!
- Turn it up!

840
01:06:35,070 --> 01:06:36,490
Speak up!

841
01:06:37,280 --> 01:06:38,740
That's it!

842
01:06:39,820 --> 01:06:42,660
<i>...and that's all I have to say about that.</i>

843
01:06:49,960 --> 01:06:52,920
That's so right on, man. You said it all.

844
01:06:54,420 --> 01:06:56,920
What's your name, man?

845
01:06:57,010 --> 01:06:59,630
<i>My name is Forrest. Forrest Gump.</i>

846
01:07:00,850 --> 01:07:02,010
<i>Forrest Gump!</i>

847
01:07:02,140 --> 01:07:03,510
- Gump!
- Gump!

848
01:07:05,020 --> 01:07:08,770
Forrest! Forrest!

849
01:07:12,820 --> 01:07:15,190
- <i>Jenny!</i>
- Forrest!

850
01:07:31,960 --> 01:07:34,630
Hey! Hey!

851
01:07:42,720 --> 01:07:45,850
<i>It was the happiest moment of my life.</i>

852
01:07:48,180 --> 01:07:51,560
<i>Jenny and me were just like
peas and carrots again.</i>

853
01:07:52,900 --> 01:07:54,480
<i>She showed me around,</i>

854
01:07:54,570 --> 01:07:57,150
<i>and even introduced me
to some of her new friends.</i>

855
01:07:57,240 --> 01:07:58,570
Shut that blind, man.

856
01:07:58,690 --> 01:08:00,900
And get your white ass
away from that window.

857
01:08:00,990 --> 01:08:03,070
Don't you know we in a war here?

858
01:08:03,910 --> 01:08:05,330
Hey, man, he's cool. He's cool.
He's one of us.

859
01:08:05,410 --> 01:08:07,330
- Let me tell you about us.
- Where the hell have you been?

860
01:08:07,410 --> 01:08:09,500
Our purpose here
is to protect our black leaders

861
01:08:09,580 --> 01:08:11,330
from the racial onslaught of the pig

862
01:08:11,420 --> 01:08:13,500
who wishes to brutalize
our black leaders,

863
01:08:13,580 --> 01:08:16,920
rape our women,
and destroy our black communities.

864
01:08:19,840 --> 01:08:21,760
Who's the baby killer?

865
01:08:21,880 --> 01:08:24,590
This is my good friend I told you about.
This is Forrest Gump.

866
01:08:24,680 --> 01:08:26,430
Forrest, this is Wesley.

867
01:08:26,510 --> 01:08:27,810
Wesley and I lived together in Berkeley,

868
01:08:27,890 --> 01:08:30,520
and he's the president
of the Berkeley chapter of SDS.

869
01:08:30,600 --> 01:08:32,020
Let me tell you something else.

870
01:08:32,100 --> 01:08:36,360
We are here to offer protection and help
for all of those who need our help,

871
01:08:36,440 --> 01:08:40,030
because we, the Black Panthers,
are against the war in Vietnam.

872
01:08:40,110 --> 01:08:43,780
Yes, we are against any war
where black soldiers are sent to the frontline

873
01:08:43,870 --> 01:08:45,780
to die for a country that hates them.

874
01:08:45,870 --> 01:08:49,040
Yes, we are against any war
where black soldiers go to fight

875
01:08:49,120 --> 01:08:52,210
and come to be brutalized and killed
in their own communities

876
01:08:52,290 --> 01:08:53,870
as they sleep in their beds at night.

877
01:08:53,960 --> 01:08:55,130
You are a fucking asshole!

878
01:08:55,210 --> 01:08:58,590
Yes, we are against all these racist
and imperial dog acts.

879
01:09:07,890 --> 01:09:11,100
Forrest! Quit it! Quit it!

880
01:09:13,060 --> 01:09:14,310
Forrest!

881
01:09:14,900 --> 01:09:16,650
Stop it! Stop it!

882
01:09:23,280 --> 01:09:24,650
Oh, God...

883
01:09:25,490 --> 01:09:27,910
I shouldn't have brought you here.

884
01:09:27,990 --> 01:09:31,620
I should have known it was just
gonna be some bullshit hassle.

885
01:09:32,790 --> 01:09:35,420
He should not be hitting you, Jenny.

886
01:09:40,340 --> 01:09:42,090
Come on, Forrest.

887
01:09:47,800 --> 01:09:51,810
Sorry I had a fight in the middle
of your Black Panther party.

888
01:09:54,690 --> 01:09:57,020
He doesn't mean it when
he does things like this. He doesn't.

889
01:09:57,100 --> 01:09:59,440
I would never hurt you, Jenny.

890
01:10:01,280 --> 01:10:03,530
I know you wouldn't, Forrest.

891
01:10:05,450 --> 01:10:08,030
I wanted to be your boyfriend.

892
01:10:18,540 --> 01:10:20,960
That uniform is a trip, Forrest.

893
01:10:22,340 --> 01:10:25,550
You look handsome in it. You do.

894
01:10:29,640 --> 01:10:31,550
- You know what?
- What?

895
01:10:35,180 --> 01:10:38,810
I'm glad we were here together
in our nation's capital.

896
01:10:40,400 --> 01:10:42,150
Me, too, Forrest.

897
01:10:42,230 --> 01:10:46,900
<i>We walked around all night,
Jenny and me, just talking.</i>

898
01:10:48,990 --> 01:10:52,160
<i>She told me about
all the traveling she'd done.</i>

899
01:10:52,240 --> 01:10:56,830
<i>And how she'd discovered ways
to expand her mind</i>

900
01:10:56,910 --> 01:11:00,000
<i>and learn how to live in harmony,</i>

901
01:11:00,080 --> 01:11:02,420
<i>which must be out west somewhere,</i>

902
01:11:02,500 --> 01:11:04,840
<i>'cause she made it
all the way to California.</i>

903
01:11:04,920 --> 01:11:07,170
<i>Try to love one another right now</i>

904
01:11:07,260 --> 01:11:08,430
Hey!

905
01:11:09,390 --> 01:11:11,930
Anybody want to go to San Francisco?

906
01:11:12,010 --> 01:11:13,890
- I'll go.
- Far out.

907
01:11:15,350 --> 01:11:18,520
<i>It was a very special night
for the two of us.</i>

908
01:11:20,100 --> 01:11:22,190
<i>I didn't want it to end.</i>

909
01:11:22,900 --> 01:11:25,400
I wish you wouldn't go, Jenny.

910
01:11:26,400 --> 01:11:28,190
I have to, Forrest.

911
01:11:29,200 --> 01:11:30,450
Jenny?

912
01:11:32,620 --> 01:11:35,200
Things got a little out of hand.

913
01:11:35,290 --> 01:11:39,120
It's just this war
and that lying son of a bitch, Johnson!

914
01:11:40,790 --> 01:11:43,590
I would never hurt you, you know that.

915
01:11:46,710 --> 01:11:48,720
You know what I think?

916
01:11:50,220 --> 01:11:55,470
I think you should go home to Greenbow, Alabama!

917
01:12:05,980 --> 01:12:11,070
Forrest, we have very different lives,
you know.

918
01:12:20,500 --> 01:12:23,670
I want you to have this.

919
01:12:28,340 --> 01:12:30,510
Forrest, I can't keep this.

920
01:12:32,180 --> 01:12:36,430
I got it just by doing
what you told me to do.

921
01:12:38,470 --> 01:12:40,640
Why are you so good to me?

922
01:12:42,140 --> 01:12:43,690
You're my girl.

923
01:12:45,690 --> 01:12:47,820
I'll always be your girl.

924
01:13:28,230 --> 01:13:33,070
<i>And just like that, she was gone,
out of my life again.</i>

925
01:13:34,570 --> 01:13:36,910
<i>That's one small step for man,</i>

926
01:13:38,910 --> 01:13:41,740
<i>one giant leap for mankind.</i>

927
01:13:47,420 --> 01:13:49,920
<i>I thought I was going back to Vietnam,</i>

928
01:13:50,050 --> 01:13:53,260
<i>but instead, they decided the best way for me
to fight the Communists</i>

929
01:13:53,340 --> 01:13:54,970
<i>was to play Ping-Pong.</i>

930
01:13:55,050 --> 01:13:57,340
<i>So, I was in the Special Services,</i>

931
01:13:57,430 --> 01:14:00,680
<i>traveling around the country
cheering up all them wounded veterans</i>

932
01:14:00,760 --> 01:14:03,180
and showing them how to play Ping-Pong.

933
01:14:03,270 --> 01:14:05,190
I was so good that some years later

934
01:14:05,270 --> 01:14:08,900
<i>the Army decided that I should be
on the All-American Ping-Pong team.</i>

935
01:14:09,520 --> 01:14:11,940
<i>We were the first Americans
to visit the land of China</i>

936
01:14:12,030 --> 01:14:14,440
<i>in like a million years,
or something like that.</i>

937
01:14:14,570 --> 01:14:17,990
<i>Somebody said world peace was in our hands,</i>

938
01:14:18,070 --> 01:14:20,870
<i>but all I did was play Ping-Pong.</i>

939
01:14:20,950 --> 01:14:24,040
When I got home,
I was a national celebrity.

940
01:14:24,750 --> 01:14:27,040
Famouser even than Captain Kangaroo.

941
01:14:27,120 --> 01:14:29,790
<i>Here he is, Forrest Gump, right here.</i>

942
01:14:36,550 --> 01:14:38,300
<i>Mr. Gump, have a seat.</i>

943
01:14:40,800 --> 01:14:42,970
<i>Forrest Gump, John Lennon.</i>

944
01:14:43,640 --> 01:14:44,890
- <i>Welcome home.</i>
- <i>You had quite a trip.</i>

945
01:14:44,980 --> 01:14:48,310
<i>Can you tell us, what was China like?</i>

946
01:14:51,570 --> 01:14:56,820
<i>In the land of China,
people hardly got nothing at all.</i>

947
01:14:56,900 --> 01:14:58,490
<i>No possessions?</i>

948
01:15:01,120 --> 01:15:04,330
<i>And in China, they never go to church.</i>

949
01:15:05,620 --> 01:15:07,330
<i>No religion, too?</i>

950
01:15:09,250 --> 01:15:12,540
- <i>Hard to imagine.</i>
- <i>Well, it's easy if you try, Dick.</i>

951
01:15:14,340 --> 01:15:16,710
<i>Some years later,
that nice young man from England</i>

952
01:15:16,800 --> 01:15:19,430
<i>was on his way home
to see his little boy</i>

953
01:15:19,510 --> 01:15:22,510
<i>and was signing some autographs,</i>

954
01:15:22,640 --> 01:15:26,600
<i>and for no particular reason at all,
somebody shot him.</i>

955
01:15:29,650 --> 01:15:33,480
They gave you the Congressional Medal of Honor.

956
01:15:34,780 --> 01:15:36,860
Now, that's Lieutenant Dan.

957
01:15:39,660 --> 01:15:41,280
Lieutenant Dan!

958
01:15:41,370 --> 01:15:45,830
They gave you the Congressional Medal of Honor!

959
01:15:47,710 --> 01:15:49,210
Yes, sir, they surely did.

960
01:15:49,290 --> 01:15:51,290
They gave you,

961
01:15:51,380 --> 01:15:55,550
an imbecile, a moron who goes on television

962
01:15:55,630 --> 01:15:59,880
and makes a fool out of himself
in front of the whole damn country,

963
01:16:00,550 --> 01:16:03,050
the Congressional Medal of Honor.

964
01:16:04,220 --> 01:16:05,390
Yes, sir.

965
01:16:07,560 --> 01:16:10,390
Well, then, that's just perfect!

966
01:16:12,310 --> 01:16:14,650
Yeah, well,
I just got one thing to say to that.

967
01:16:14,730 --> 01:16:16,980
God damn bless America.

968
01:16:17,900 --> 01:16:19,190
Hey!

969
01:16:20,990 --> 01:16:22,320
Oh, God!

970
01:16:24,830 --> 01:16:27,240
- Oh, God!
- Lieutenant Dan!

971
01:16:28,370 --> 01:16:31,120
<i>Lieutenant Dan said
he was living in a hotel.</i>

972
01:16:31,210 --> 01:16:33,170
<i>And because he didn't have no legs,</i>

973
01:16:33,250 --> 01:16:36,420
<i>he spent most of his time
exercising his arms.</i>

974
01:16:39,300 --> 01:16:41,760
Take a right. Take a right.

975
01:16:44,390 --> 01:16:46,930
Hey! Come on, already!

976
01:16:47,010 --> 01:16:49,810
What do you do here in New York,
Lieutenant Dan?

977
01:16:49,890 --> 01:16:52,440
I'm living off the government tit.

978
01:16:54,060 --> 01:16:55,440
Sucking it dry!

979
01:16:55,520 --> 01:16:57,570
Hey! Hey! Hey! Are you blind?

980
01:16:57,650 --> 01:16:59,360
- I'm walking here!
- Get out of the way!

981
01:16:59,440 --> 01:17:02,030
Get out! Come on, go! Go! Go!

982
01:17:09,080 --> 01:17:12,830
<i>I stayed with Lieutenant Dan
and celebrated the holidays.</i>

983
01:17:17,250 --> 01:17:20,670
<i>You have a great year.
Hurry home and God bless you.</i>

984
01:17:23,680 --> 01:17:26,470
Have you found Jesus yet, Gump?

985
01:17:28,060 --> 01:17:31,720
I didn't know I was supposed to be
looking for him, sir.

986
01:17:38,320 --> 01:17:41,690
That's all these cripples,
down at the VA,

987
01:17:41,780 --> 01:17:44,200
that's all they ever talk about.

988
01:17:45,360 --> 01:17:48,320
Jesus this and Jesus that.

989
01:17:49,790 --> 01:17:52,080
Have I found Jesus?

990
01:17:52,700 --> 01:17:55,710
They even had a priest come
and talk to me.

991
01:17:56,580 --> 01:18:01,250
He said God is listening,
but I have to help myself.

992
01:18:02,630 --> 01:18:04,920
How if I accept Jesus into my heart,

993
01:18:05,930 --> 01:18:09,720
I'll get to walk beside him
in the kingdom of heaven.

994
01:18:09,810 --> 01:18:11,970
Did you hear what I said?

995
01:18:13,020 --> 01:18:17,020
Walk beside him in the kingdom of heaven.

996
01:18:17,100 --> 01:18:20,060
Well, kiss my crippled ass.

997
01:18:20,150 --> 01:18:23,530
God is listening? What a crock of shit.

998
01:18:27,200 --> 01:18:29,820
I'm going to heaven, Lieutenant Dan.

999
01:18:37,620 --> 01:18:39,000
Well,

1000
01:18:41,960 --> 01:18:45,340
before you go, why don't you get
your ass down to the corner

1001
01:18:45,420 --> 01:18:47,930
- and get us another bottle of Ripple.
- Yes, sir.

1002
01:18:48,010 --> 01:18:53,140
<i>We are at approximately 45th Street
in New York City at One Astor PIaza.</i>

1003
01:18:53,220 --> 01:18:55,060
<i>This is the site of the old Astor Hotel.</i>

1004
01:18:55,140 --> 01:18:57,350
What the hell is in Bayou La Batre?

1005
01:18:57,440 --> 01:18:59,770
- Shrimping boats.
- Shrimping boats?

1006
01:18:59,860 --> 01:19:02,270
Who gives a shit about shrimping boats?

1007
01:19:02,360 --> 01:19:03,820
I gotta buy me
one of them shrimping boats,

1008
01:19:03,900 --> 01:19:05,440
soon as I have some money.

1009
01:19:05,530 --> 01:19:08,360
I made me a promise to Bubba in Vietnam

1010
01:19:08,450 --> 01:19:11,160
that as soon as the war was over,
we'd go in partners.

1011
01:19:11,240 --> 01:19:14,660
He'd be the captain of the shrimping boat
and I'd be his first mate.

1012
01:19:14,750 --> 01:19:18,210
But now that he's dead,
that means I gotta be the captain.

1013
01:19:18,290 --> 01:19:21,000
- A shrimp boat captain.
- Yes, sir.

1014
01:19:21,080 --> 01:19:23,840
A promise is a promise, Lieutenant Dan.

1015
01:19:25,340 --> 01:19:27,800
Now hear this!

1016
01:19:28,550 --> 01:19:32,390
Private Gump here
is gonna be a shrimp boat captain.

1017
01:19:33,140 --> 01:19:34,560
Well, I tell you what, Gilligan,

1018
01:19:34,640 --> 01:19:37,100
the day that you are
a shrimp boat captain,

1019
01:19:37,180 --> 01:19:40,730
- I will come and be your first mate.
- Okay.

1020
01:19:40,810 --> 01:19:45,150
If you're ever a shrimp boat captain,
that's the day I'm an astronaut.

1021
01:19:45,230 --> 01:19:48,240
Danny, what are you complaining about?

1022
01:19:48,320 --> 01:19:50,910
- What are you doing, hon?
- Mr. Hot Wheels.

1023
01:19:50,990 --> 01:19:54,620
- Who's your friend?
- My name is Forrest, Forrest Gump.

1024
01:19:55,450 --> 01:19:59,660
This is Cunning Carla and Long-Limbs Lenore.

1025
01:20:00,750 --> 01:20:03,960
So, where you been, baby cakes, huh?
Haven't seen you around lately.

1026
01:20:04,040 --> 01:20:05,500
You know, you should have
been here for Christmas,

1027
01:20:05,590 --> 01:20:06,920
'cause Tommy bought a round on the house

1028
01:20:07,010 --> 01:20:08,510
and gave everybody a turkey sandwich.

1029
01:20:08,590 --> 01:20:11,630
Well, well, I had company.

1030
01:20:12,510 --> 01:20:16,180
Hey, hey! We was just there.
That's at Times Square.

1031
01:20:16,810 --> 01:20:20,940
Don't you just love New Year's?
You get to start all over.

1032
01:20:21,020 --> 01:20:24,310
- Hey, Lenore...
- Everybody gets a second chance.

1033
01:20:24,400 --> 01:20:26,940
<i>It's funny,
but in the middle of all that fun,</i>

1034
01:20:27,030 --> 01:20:29,320
<i>I began to think about Jenny,</i>

1035
01:20:30,240 --> 01:20:34,700
<i>wondering how she was spending
her New Year's night out in California.</i>

1036
01:20:57,310 --> 01:21:00,810
<i>...eight, seven, six, five,</i>

1037
01:21:00,930 --> 01:21:04,400
four, three, two, one!

1038
01:21:04,520 --> 01:21:07,190
Happy New Year!

1039
01:21:23,670 --> 01:21:26,380
Happy New Year, Lieutenant Dan!

1040
01:22:01,660 --> 01:22:05,330
What are you, stupid or something?
What's your problem?

1041
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:07,420
What's his problem?

1042
01:22:07,500 --> 01:22:09,750
Did you lose your pecker in the war or something?

1043
01:22:09,840 --> 01:22:11,880
What, is your friend stupid or something?

1044
01:22:11,960 --> 01:22:13,050
What did you say?

1045
01:22:13,130 --> 01:22:14,550
I said, is your friend stupid or something?

1046
01:22:14,630 --> 01:22:16,800
Hey! Don't call him stupid!

1047
01:22:16,890 --> 01:22:18,840
- Hey, don't you push her!
- You shut up!

1048
01:22:18,930 --> 01:22:20,970
- Don't you ever call him stupid!
- What's the matter, baby?

1049
01:22:21,060 --> 01:22:22,770
- Why are you so upset?
- Just get the hell out of here.

1050
01:22:22,850 --> 01:22:23,930
- Stupid damn...
- Get your goddamn clothes...

1051
01:22:24,020 --> 01:22:25,520
You belong in <i>Ripley's Believe It Or Not!</i>

1052
01:22:25,600 --> 01:22:27,480
- Get the hell out of here!
- You should be in a sideshow!

1053
01:22:27,560 --> 01:22:28,600
Go on! Get out of here!

1054
01:22:28,690 --> 01:22:29,980
Come on, Lenore.
We don't need this shit!

1055
01:22:30,070 --> 01:22:31,440
Get out of here!

1056
01:22:33,070 --> 01:22:35,610
- You retard.
- Loser. You freak.

1057
01:22:40,990 --> 01:22:42,200
No, no.

1058
01:23:07,350 --> 01:23:11,310
I'm sorry I ruined your New Year's Eve party,
Lieutenant Dan.

1059
01:23:11,900 --> 01:23:14,190
She tasted like cigarettes.

1060
01:23:30,380 --> 01:23:34,880
<i>I guess Lieutenant Dan figured
there's some things you just can't change.</i>

1061
01:23:34,960 --> 01:23:40,090
<i>He didn't want to be called crippled,
just like I didn't want to be called stupid.</i>

1062
01:23:45,600 --> 01:23:47,480
Happy New Year, Gump.

1063
01:23:52,270 --> 01:23:53,650
<i>The US Ping-Pong team</i>

1064
01:23:53,730 --> 01:23:56,030
<i>met with President Nixon today
at an Oval Office ceremony...</i>

1065
01:23:56,110 --> 01:23:58,860
And wouldn't you know it?
A few months later,

1066
01:23:58,950 --> 01:24:02,910
they invited me and the Ping-Pong team
to visit the White House.

1067
01:24:02,990 --> 01:24:05,240
So, I went, again.

1068
01:24:06,080 --> 01:24:09,540
And I met the President of the United States, again.

1069
01:24:10,290 --> 01:24:13,250
<i>Only, this time, they didn't get us rooms
in a real fancy hotel.</i>

1070
01:24:13,340 --> 01:24:16,710
<i>So, are you enjoying yourself
in our nation's capital, young man?</i>

1071
01:24:16,800 --> 01:24:19,800
- <i>Yes, sir.</i>
- <i>Well, where are you staying?</i>

1072
01:24:19,880 --> 01:24:22,510
- <i>It's called the Hotel Ebbott.</i>
- <i>Oh, no, no, no, no.</i>

1073
01:24:22,590 --> 01:24:25,720
<i>I know of a much nicer hotel.
It's brand-new, very modern.</i>

1074
01:24:25,810 --> 01:24:27,810
<i>I'll have my people
take care of it for you.</i>

1075
01:24:28,430 --> 01:24:29,560
<i>Security, Frank Wills.</i>

1076
01:24:29,640 --> 01:24:33,230
Yeah, sir, you might want
to send a maintenance man

1077
01:24:33,310 --> 01:24:35,980
over to that office across the way.

1078
01:24:36,070 --> 01:24:38,940
The lights are off, and they must be
looking for a fuse box or something,

1079
01:24:39,030 --> 01:24:41,740
'cause them flashlights,
they're keeping me awake.

1080
01:24:41,820 --> 01:24:43,450
<i>Okay, sir. I'll check it out.</i>

1081
01:24:43,530 --> 01:24:45,240
- Thank you.
- <i>No problem.</i>

1082
01:24:45,330 --> 01:24:47,240
- Good night.
- <i>Good night.</i>

1083
01:24:50,870 --> 01:24:56,250
<i>Therefore, I shall resign the presidency
effective at noon tomorrow.</i>

1084
01:24:56,340 --> 01:24:58,380
<i>Vice President Ford</i>

1085
01:24:58,460 --> 01:25:02,970
<i>will be sworn in as president
at that hour in this office.</i>

1086
01:25:04,340 --> 01:25:09,140
<i>As I recall the high hopes for America
with which we began this second term...</i>

1087
01:25:14,400 --> 01:25:15,940
Sergeant Gump.

1088
01:25:16,440 --> 01:25:18,650
- Yes, sir!
- As you were.

1089
01:25:18,730 --> 01:25:21,860
I have your discharge papers.
Your service is up, son.

1090
01:25:25,280 --> 01:25:28,030
Does this mean
I can't play Ping-Pong no more?

1091
01:25:28,120 --> 01:25:30,080
For the Army it does.

1092
01:25:32,710 --> 01:25:37,590
<i>And just like that,
my service in the United States Army was over.</i>

1093
01:25:42,880 --> 01:25:44,680
<i>So, I went home.</i>

1094
01:26:06,160 --> 01:26:09,580
- I'm home, Mama.
- I know, I know.

1095
01:26:11,200 --> 01:26:12,750
- Louise, he's here.
- <i>Now, when I got home,</i>

1096
01:26:12,830 --> 01:26:16,870
<i>I had no idea,
but Mama had had all sorts of visitors.</i>

1097
01:26:17,000 --> 01:26:19,290
We've had all sorts of visitors, Forrest.

1098
01:26:19,380 --> 01:26:22,460
Everybody wants you
to use their Ping-Pong stuff.

1099
01:26:22,550 --> 01:26:26,340
One man even left a check for $25,000

1100
01:26:26,430 --> 01:26:29,890
if you'd be agreeable to saying
you liked using their paddle.

1101
01:26:30,010 --> 01:26:32,680
Oh, but, Mama,
I only like using my own paddle.

1102
01:26:32,770 --> 01:26:34,770
- Hi, Miss Louise.
- Hey, Forrest.

1103
01:26:34,850 --> 01:26:37,770
I know that. I know that.

1104
01:26:37,850 --> 01:26:40,520
But it's $25,000, Forrest.

1105
01:26:40,610 --> 01:26:45,280
I thought maybe you could hold it for a while,
see if it grows on you.

1106
01:26:45,360 --> 01:26:47,490
- Oh, you look good, Forrest.
- <i>That Mama, she sure was right.</i>

1107
01:26:47,570 --> 01:26:50,070
- You look real good.
- <i>It's funny how things work out.</i>

1108
01:26:50,200 --> 01:26:53,330
<i>I didn't stay home for long,
because I'd made a promise to Bubba,</i>

1109
01:26:53,410 --> 01:26:55,660
<i>and I always try to keep my promise.</i>

1110
01:26:55,750 --> 01:26:57,290
<i>So, I went on down to Bayou La Batre</i>

1111
01:26:57,370 --> 01:27:01,130
<i>to meet Bubba's family
and make their introduction.</i>

1112
01:27:01,210 --> 01:27:04,880
Are you crazy, or just plain stupid?

1113
01:27:05,590 --> 01:27:07,840
Stupid is as stupid does, Mrs. Blue.

1114
01:27:07,930 --> 01:27:09,300
I guess.

1115
01:27:10,300 --> 01:27:13,890
<i>And, of course,
I paid my respect to Bubba himself.</i>

1116
01:27:15,890 --> 01:27:18,440
Hey, Bubba, it's me, Forrest Gump.

1117
01:27:21,560 --> 01:27:25,610
I remember everything you said,
and I got it all figured out.

1118
01:27:28,410 --> 01:27:35,200
I'm taking the $24,562 and 47 cents that I got...

1119
01:27:36,290 --> 01:27:39,870
<i>Or, that's left after a new hair cut
and a new suit,</i>

1120
01:27:39,960 --> 01:27:41,920
<i>and I took Mama out
to a real fancy dinner,</i>

1121
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:45,250
<i>and I bought a bus ticket
and three Dr. Peppers.</i>

1122
01:27:45,800 --> 01:27:47,590
Tell me something.

1123
01:27:48,630 --> 01:27:50,760
Are you stupid or something?

1124
01:27:50,840 --> 01:27:52,890
Stupid is as stupid does, sir.

1125
01:27:52,970 --> 01:27:55,930
Well, that's what's left after me saying,

1126
01:27:56,850 --> 01:27:58,980
"When I was in China
on the All-America Ping-Pong team,

1127
01:27:59,100 --> 01:28:02,900
"I just loved playing Ping-Pong
with my Flex-O-Light Ping-Pong paddle,"

1128
01:28:02,980 --> 01:28:04,230
which everybody knows isn't true,

1129
01:28:04,320 --> 01:28:05,690
but Mama says it's just a little white lie

1130
01:28:05,780 --> 01:28:07,940
so it wouldn't hurt nobody.

1131
01:28:09,360 --> 01:28:15,280
So, anyway, I'm putting all that on gas,
ropes and new nets

1132
01:28:16,040 --> 01:28:17,790
and a brand-new shrimping boat.

1133
01:28:39,480 --> 01:28:42,730
<i>Now, Bubba had told me everything
he knew about shrimping,</i>

1134
01:28:42,810 --> 01:28:45,150
<i>but you know what I found out?</i>

1135
01:28:46,820 --> 01:28:49,150
<i>Shrimping is tough.</i>

1136
01:28:51,360 --> 01:28:53,200
I only caught five.

1137
01:28:53,320 --> 01:28:56,660
A couple more,
you could have yourself a cocktail.

1138
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:01,750
Hey, you ever think
about naming this old boat?

1139
01:29:01,830 --> 01:29:04,500
It's bad luck to have a boat without a name.

1140
01:29:06,880 --> 01:29:11,720
<i>I'd never named a boat before,
but there was only one I could think of,</i>

1141
01:29:12,880 --> 01:29:16,100
<i>the most beautiful name
in the wide world.</i>

1142
01:29:37,120 --> 01:29:39,950
<i>Now, I hadn't heard from Jenny
in a long while,</i>

1143
01:29:40,040 --> 01:29:42,580
<i>but I thought about her a lot,</i>

1144
01:29:42,710 --> 01:29:46,170
<i>and I hoped that whatever
she was doing made her happy.</i>

1145
01:31:32,440 --> 01:31:34,980
<i>I thought about Jenny all the time.</i>

1146
01:31:59,630 --> 01:32:00,800
Hey!

1147
01:32:24,660 --> 01:32:29,330
Lieutenant Dan, what are you doing here?

1148
01:32:29,410 --> 01:32:33,330
Well, thought I'd try out my sea legs.

1149
01:32:33,420 --> 01:32:37,170
But you ain't got no legs, Lieutenant Dan.

1150
01:32:37,260 --> 01:32:39,550
Yes, I know that.

1151
01:32:39,880 --> 01:32:41,930
You wrote me a letter, you idiot.

1152
01:32:42,050 --> 01:32:46,600
Well, well. Captain Forrest Gump.
I had to see this for myself.

1153
01:32:48,220 --> 01:32:55,110
And I told you if you were ever
a shrimp boat captain

1154
01:32:55,230 --> 01:32:57,820
that I'd be your first mate.
Well, here I am.

1155
01:32:57,900 --> 01:33:01,030
- I am a man of my word.
- Okay.

1156
01:33:01,110 --> 01:33:05,120
Yeah, but don't you be thinking that
I'm going to be calling you "sir."

1157
01:33:05,240 --> 01:33:06,580
No, sir.

1158
01:33:15,460 --> 01:33:17,750
That's my boat.

1159
01:33:20,340 --> 01:33:25,800
I have a feeling if we head due east,
we'll find some shrimp,

1160
01:33:25,930 --> 01:33:27,510
so take a left.

1161
01:33:28,930 --> 01:33:31,850
- Take a left!
- Which way?

1162
01:33:31,930 --> 01:33:34,600
Over there! They're over there!

1163
01:33:35,270 --> 01:33:39,110
- Get on the wheel and take a left!
- Okay.

1164
01:33:40,320 --> 01:33:44,450
Gump, what are you doing?
Take a left! Left!

1165
01:33:46,820 --> 01:33:50,450
That's where we're going to find
those shrimp, my boy!

1166
01:33:52,040 --> 01:33:53,620
That's where we'll find them.

1167
01:34:06,300 --> 01:34:10,430
- Still no shrimp, Lieutenant Dan.
- Okay, so I was wrong.

1168
01:34:11,140 --> 01:34:14,350
How are we going to find them?

1169
01:34:14,480 --> 01:34:16,980
Well, maybe you should
just pray for shrimp.

1170
01:34:23,610 --> 01:34:26,280
<i>So, I went to church every Sunday.</i>

1171
01:34:27,530 --> 01:34:29,530
<i>Sometimes Lieutenant Dan came, too,</i>

1172
01:34:29,660 --> 01:34:32,660
<i>though I think
he left the praying up to me.</i>

1173
01:34:48,140 --> 01:34:52,510
- No shrimp.
- Where the hell's this God of yours?

1174
01:34:53,350 --> 01:34:59,060
<i>It's funny Lieutenant Dan said that,
'cause right then, God showed up.</i>

1175
01:35:15,910 --> 01:35:20,750
- You'll never sink this boat!
- <i>Now, me, I was scared,</i>

1176
01:35:20,880 --> 01:35:23,920
<i>but Lieutenant Dan, he was mad.</i>

1177
01:35:24,050 --> 01:35:25,380
Come on!

1178
01:35:28,510 --> 01:35:33,720
You call this a storm?
Come on, you son of a bitch!

1179
01:35:35,850 --> 01:35:40,230
It's time for a showdown! You and me!

1180
01:35:40,350 --> 01:35:44,230
I'm right here! Come and get me!

1181
01:35:46,030 --> 01:35:49,910
You'll never sink this boat!

1182
01:35:51,950 --> 01:35:54,120
<i>Hurricane Carmen came through here yesterday,</i>

1183
01:35:54,240 --> 01:35:56,790
<i>destroying nearly everything in its path.</i>

1184
01:35:56,910 --> 01:35:59,410
<i>And as in other towns
up and down the coast,</i>

1185
01:35:59,580 --> 01:36:01,960
Bayou La Batre's
entire shrimping industry

1186
01:36:02,040 --> 01:36:05,920
<i>has fallen victim to Carmen
and has been left in utter ruin.</i>

1187
01:36:06,050 --> 01:36:09,170
<i>Speaking with local officials,
this reporter has learned,</i>

1188
01:36:09,260 --> 01:36:12,720
<i>in fact, only one shrimping boat
actually survived the storm.</i>

1189
01:36:13,100 --> 01:36:15,720
Louise. Louise, there's Forrest.

1190
01:36:16,430 --> 01:36:18,430
<i>After that, shrimping was easy.</i>

1191
01:36:24,110 --> 01:36:27,230
<i>Since people still needed them shrimps
for shrimp cocktails</i>

1192
01:36:27,320 --> 01:36:31,450
and barbecues and all,
and we were the only boat left standing,

1193
01:36:31,610 --> 01:36:34,870
Bubba-Gump Shrimp's what they got.

1194
01:36:34,950 --> 01:36:39,540
We got a whole bunch of boats, 12 <i>Jennys,</i>

1195
01:36:39,620 --> 01:36:43,120
a big old warehouse.
We even have hats that say "Bubba-Gump" on them.

1196
01:36:43,460 --> 01:36:46,750
Bubba-Gump Shrimp. It's a household name.

1197
01:36:46,960 --> 01:36:48,670
Hold on there, boy.

1198
01:36:48,800 --> 01:36:53,340
Are you telling me you're the owner
of the Bubba-Gump Shrimp Corporation?

1199
01:36:53,470 --> 01:36:56,470
Yes, sir. We got more money
than Davy Crockett.

1200
01:36:58,100 --> 01:37:02,140
Boy, I heard some whoppers in my time,
but that tops them all.

1201
01:37:04,860 --> 01:37:07,650
We was sitting next to a millionaire.

1202
01:37:11,150 --> 01:37:15,780
Well, I thought it was a very lovely story,

1203
01:37:16,200 --> 01:37:20,830
and you tell it so well,
with such enthusiasm.

1204
01:37:22,540 --> 01:37:25,210
Would you like to see
what Lieutenant Dan looks like?

1205
01:37:25,330 --> 01:37:26,840
Well, yes, I would.

1206
01:37:32,050 --> 01:37:34,090
That's him right there.

1207
01:37:36,220 --> 01:37:38,470
And let me tell you something
about Lieutenant Dan...

1208
01:37:39,640 --> 01:37:40,680
Forrest,

1209
01:37:46,230 --> 01:37:49,020
I never thanked you for saving my life.

1210
01:38:15,050 --> 01:38:21,350
<i>He never actually said so,
but I think he made his peace with God.</i>

1211
01:38:29,020 --> 01:38:31,230
<i>For the second time in 17 days,</i>

1212
01:38:31,360 --> 01:38:34,820
<i>President Ford escaped
possible assassination today.</i>

1213
01:38:34,900 --> 01:38:36,200
<i>Base to Jenny 1.</i>

1214
01:38:36,280 --> 01:38:39,780
- <i>Base to Jenny 1.</i>
- Jenny 1. Go, Margo.

1215
01:38:39,870 --> 01:38:41,370
<i>Forrest has a phone call.</i>

1216
01:38:41,450 --> 01:38:43,950
Yeah, well, you'll have to tell them
to call him back.

1217
01:38:44,040 --> 01:38:47,420
- He is indisposed at the moment.
- <i>His mama's sick.</i>

1218
01:39:08,100 --> 01:39:10,480
- Where's Mama?
- She's upstairs.

1219
01:39:13,320 --> 01:39:15,280
Hi, Forrest.

1220
01:39:16,240 --> 01:39:18,780
- I'll see you tomorrow.
- All right.

1221
01:39:25,450 --> 01:39:28,620
We sure got you straightened out,
didn't we, boy?

1222
01:39:39,970 --> 01:39:43,930
- What's the matter, Mama?
- I'm dying, Forrest.

1223
01:39:47,270 --> 01:39:49,640
Come on in, sit down over here.

1224
01:40:03,990 --> 01:40:07,500
- Why are you dying, Mama?
- It's my time.

1225
01:40:08,500 --> 01:40:10,370
It's just my time.

1226
01:40:11,830 --> 01:40:16,000
Now, don't you be afraid, sweetheart.

1227
01:40:17,630 --> 01:40:20,010
Death is just a part of life,

1228
01:40:21,010 --> 01:40:23,640
something we're all destined to do.

1229
01:40:25,470 --> 01:40:29,850
I didn't know it,
but I was destined to be your mama.

1230
01:40:30,690 --> 01:40:34,270
- I did the best I could.
- You did good, Mama.

1231
01:40:35,070 --> 01:40:40,240
Well, I happen to believe
you make your own destiny.

1232
01:40:41,740 --> 01:40:44,990
You have to do the best
with what God gave you.

1233
01:40:48,870 --> 01:40:51,000
What's my destiny, Mama?

1234
01:40:53,170 --> 01:40:56,380
You're going to have
to figure that out for yourself.

1235
01:40:57,670 --> 01:41:00,630
Life is a box of chocolates, Forrest.

1236
01:41:00,720 --> 01:41:02,880
You never know what you're going to get.

1237
01:41:03,010 --> 01:41:07,390
<i>Mama always had a way of explaining things
so I could understand them.</i>

1238
01:41:07,470 --> 01:41:09,680
I will miss you, Forrest.

1239
01:41:11,520 --> 01:41:15,560
<i>She had got the cancer
and died on a Tuesday.</i>

1240
01:41:17,070 --> 01:41:20,400
<i>I bought her a new hat
with little flowers on it.</i>

1241
01:41:23,450 --> 01:41:26,740
And that's all I have to say about that.

1242
01:41:33,580 --> 01:41:35,880
Didn't you say you were waiting
for the number seven bus?

1243
01:41:35,960 --> 01:41:38,750
There'll be another one along shortly.

1244
01:41:42,590 --> 01:41:46,180
Now, because I had been a football star,
and a war hero,

1245
01:41:46,260 --> 01:41:49,390
and a national celebrity,
and a shrimping boat captain,

1246
01:41:49,890 --> 01:41:53,100
and a college graduate,
the city fathers of Greenbow, Alabama

1247
01:41:53,230 --> 01:41:56,440
decided to get together
and offered me a fine job.

1248
01:41:57,820 --> 01:42:01,480
<i>So, I never went back to work
for Lieutenant Dan,</i>

1249
01:42:01,610 --> 01:42:04,320
<i>though he did take care
of my Bubba-Gump money.</i>

1250
01:42:04,450 --> 01:42:09,030
<i>He got me invested
in some kind of fruit company.</i>

1251
01:42:09,120 --> 01:42:10,700
<i>And so then, I got a call from him saying</i>

1252
01:42:10,790 --> 01:42:14,250
we don't have to worry about money
no more, and I said,

1253
01:42:14,330 --> 01:42:16,620
"That's good. One less thing."

1254
01:42:19,670 --> 01:42:23,050
<i>Now, Mama said there's only
so much fortune a man really needs,</i>

1255
01:42:24,300 --> 01:42:27,180
<i>and the rest is just for showing off.</i>

1256
01:42:27,260 --> 01:42:31,140
<i>So, I gave a whole bunch of it
to the Foursquare gospel church,</i>

1257
01:42:33,810 --> 01:42:38,310
<i>and I gave a whole bunch to the
Bayou La Batre fishing hospital.</i>

1258
01:42:40,650 --> 01:42:45,190
<i>And even though Bubba was dead
and Lieutenant Dan said I was nuts,</i>

1259
01:42:45,320 --> 01:42:47,950
<i>I gave Bubba's mama Bubba's share.</i>

1260
01:42:52,160 --> 01:42:53,870
You know what?

1261
01:42:55,120 --> 01:42:58,120
<i>She didn't have to work
in nobody's kitchen no more.</i>

1262
01:42:58,210 --> 01:42:59,830
That smells wonderful.

1263
01:43:00,670 --> 01:43:04,590
<i>And 'cause I was a gazillionaire
and I liked doing it so much,</i>

1264
01:43:04,670 --> 01:43:07,010
<i>I cut that grass for free.</i>

1265
01:43:10,800 --> 01:43:13,680
<i>But at night time
when there was nothing to do</i>

1266
01:43:13,770 --> 01:43:16,140
<i>and the house was all empty,</i>

1267
01:43:17,140 --> 01:43:19,520
<i>I'd always think of Jenny.</i>

1268
01:44:23,210 --> 01:44:26,380
<i>And then, she was there.</i>

1269
01:44:59,370 --> 01:45:02,540
- Hello, Forrest.
- Hello, Jenny.

1270
01:45:14,090 --> 01:45:16,720
<i>Jenny came back and stayed with me.</i>

1271
01:45:18,310 --> 01:45:21,980
<i>Maybe it was because
she had nowhere else to go,</i>

1272
01:45:22,100 --> 01:45:25,810
<i>or maybe it was because she was so tired,
'cause she went to bed</i>

1273
01:45:25,940 --> 01:45:29,900
<i>and slept and slept,
like she hadn't slept in years.</i>

1274
01:45:31,150 --> 01:45:33,450
<i>It was wonderful having her home.</i>

1275
01:45:34,780 --> 01:45:39,910
<i>Every day we'd take a walk
and I'd jabber on like a monkey in a tree,</i>

1276
01:45:40,000 --> 01:45:42,540
<i>and she'd listen about Ping-Ponging,
and shrimping,</i>

1277
01:45:42,620 --> 01:45:46,920
<i>and Mama making a trip up to heaven.
I did all the talking.</i>

1278
01:45:47,000 --> 01:45:50,340
<i>Jenny most of the time was real quiet.</i>

1279
01:46:30,500 --> 01:46:33,710
How could you do this?

1280
01:47:10,670 --> 01:47:14,010
<i>Sometimes I guess there
just aren't enough rocks.</i>

1281
01:47:16,220 --> 01:47:20,720
<i>I never really knew why she came back,
but I didn't care.</i>

1282
01:47:20,890 --> 01:47:25,180
<i>It was like olden times.
We was like peas and carrots again.</i>

1283
01:47:27,270 --> 01:47:31,610
<i>Every day, I'd pick pretty flowers
and put them in her room for her,</i>

1284
01:47:33,110 --> 01:47:36,690
<i>and she gave me the best gift anyone
could ever get in the wide world.</i>

1285
01:47:36,780 --> 01:47:39,610
- New shoes.
- They make them just for running.

1286
01:47:44,620 --> 01:47:47,910
<i>And she even showed me how to dance.</i>

1287
01:47:56,090 --> 01:48:00,300
<i>And, well, we was like family,
Jenny and me.</i>

1288
01:48:04,060 --> 01:48:06,970
<i>And it was the happiest time in my life.</i>

1289
01:48:26,620 --> 01:48:28,410
<i>...and this Fourth is witnessing one of the</i>

1290
01:48:28,500 --> 01:48:31,500
<i>largest fireworks displays in the nation's...</i>

1291
01:48:31,580 --> 01:48:34,500
- You done watching it?
- <i>...here in New York Harbor...</i>

1292
01:48:34,630 --> 01:48:36,420
- I'm going to bed.
- <i>with a spectacular display</i>

1293
01:48:36,510 --> 01:48:39,550
<i>of tall ships earlier.
The Statue of Liberty...</i>

1294
01:48:46,600 --> 01:48:48,600
Will you marry me?

1295
01:48:53,520 --> 01:48:56,480
I'd make a good husband, Jenny.

1296
01:48:59,150 --> 01:49:01,200
You would, Forrest.

1297
01:49:03,030 --> 01:49:05,370
But you won't marry me.

1298
01:49:07,660 --> 01:49:09,870
You don't want to marry me.

1299
01:49:13,460 --> 01:49:15,880
Why don't you love me, Jenny?

1300
01:49:20,880 --> 01:49:23,010
I'm not a smart man,

1301
01:49:24,720 --> 01:49:27,140
but I know what love is.

1302
01:50:04,180 --> 01:50:05,430
Jenny.

1303
01:50:07,350 --> 01:50:09,850
Forrest, I do love you.

1304
01:51:02,980 --> 01:51:06,650
- Where are you running off to?
- I'm not running.

1305
01:52:38,250 --> 01:52:43,580
<i>That day, for no particular reason,
I decided to go for a little run.</i>

1306
01:52:44,750 --> 01:52:49,170
<i>So, I ran to the end of the road,
and when I got there,</i>

1307
01:52:49,260 --> 01:52:51,010
<i>I thought maybe I'd run
to the end of town.</i>

1308
01:52:51,090 --> 01:52:54,350
<i>President Carter, suffering from heat exhaustion, 
fell into the arms of...</i>

1309
01:52:54,430 --> 01:52:56,100
<i>And when I got there,</i>

1310
01:52:56,180 --> 01:53:00,350
<i>I thought maybe I'd just run
across Greenbow County.</i>

1311
01:53:00,440 --> 01:53:02,850
<i>And I figured since I'd run this far,</i>

1312
01:53:02,940 --> 01:53:06,190
<i>maybe I'd just run across
the great state of Alabama.</i>

1313
01:53:06,270 --> 01:53:07,480
<i>And that's what I did.</i>

1314
01:53:08,110 --> 01:53:09,900
I ran clear across Alabama.

1315
01:53:10,950 --> 01:53:14,110
For no particular reason,
I just kept on going.

1316
01:53:15,450 --> 01:53:17,030
I ran clear to the ocean.

1317
01:53:22,920 --> 01:53:26,090
<i>And when I got there,
I figured since I'd gone this far,</i>

1318
01:53:26,630 --> 01:53:29,460
<i>might as well turn around
and just keep on going.</i>

1319
01:53:33,220 --> 01:53:37,810
<i>And when I got to another ocean,
I figured since I'd gone this far,</i>

1320
01:53:39,600 --> 01:53:43,310
<i>I might as well just turn back
and keep right on going.</i>

1321
01:53:44,480 --> 01:53:49,320
<i>When I got tired, I slept.
When I got hungry, I ate.</i>

1322
01:53:49,400 --> 01:53:52,440
When I had to go, you know...

1323
01:53:54,070 --> 01:53:55,240
I went.

1324
01:53:55,320 --> 01:53:58,330
And so, you just ran.

1325
01:54:00,080 --> 01:54:01,160
Yeah.

1326
01:54:36,450 --> 01:54:41,700
<i>I'd think a lot about Mama
and Bubba and Lieutenant Dan.</i>

1327
01:54:42,700 --> 01:54:46,210
<i>But most of all, I thought about Jenny.</i>

1328
01:54:47,290 --> 01:54:49,460
<i>I thought about her a lot.</i>

1329
01:54:50,210 --> 01:54:53,300
<i>For more than two years now,
a man named Forrest Gump,</i>

1330
01:54:53,380 --> 01:54:56,800
<i>a gardener from Greenbow, Alabama,
stopping only to sleep,</i>

1331
01:54:56,890 --> 01:54:59,050
<i>has been running across America.</i>

1332
01:54:59,140 --> 01:55:01,140
<i>Charles Cooper brings us this report.</i>

1333
01:55:02,060 --> 01:55:04,480
<i>For the fourth time
on his journey across America,</i>

1334
01:55:04,560 --> 01:55:07,390
<i>Forrest Gump,
the gardener from Greenbow, Alabama,</i>

1335
01:55:07,520 --> 01:55:10,400
<i>is about to cross
the Mississippi River again today.</i>

1336
01:55:11,020 --> 01:55:13,070
- I'll be damned. Forrest?
- <i>Sir, why are you running?</i>

1337
01:55:13,150 --> 01:55:14,230
Why are you running?

1338
01:55:14,320 --> 01:55:15,900
Are you doing this for world peace?

1339
01:55:15,990 --> 01:55:17,320
Are you doing this for the homeless?

1340
01:55:17,410 --> 01:55:20,410
- Are you running for women's rights?
- Or for the environment?

1341
01:55:20,490 --> 01:55:21,490
Or for animals?

1342
01:55:21,580 --> 01:55:24,500
<i>They just couldn't believe that somebody
would do all that running</i>

1343
01:55:24,580 --> 01:55:25,950
<i>for no particular reason.</i>

1344
01:55:26,040 --> 01:55:28,000
Why are you doing this?

1345
01:55:28,080 --> 01:55:30,580
I just felt like running.

1346
01:55:30,710 --> 01:55:33,090
I just felt like running.

1347
01:55:33,210 --> 01:55:36,420
It's you. I can't believe it's really you.

1348
01:55:37,260 --> 01:55:42,390
Now, for some reason, what I was doing
seemed to make sense to people.

1349
01:55:42,560 --> 01:55:44,680
I mean, it was like an alarm
went off in my head, you know?

1350
01:55:44,770 --> 01:55:46,600
I said,
"Here's a guy that's got his act together.

1351
01:55:46,730 --> 01:55:48,690
"Here's somebody who's got it all figured out.

1352
01:55:48,770 --> 01:55:52,860
"Here's somebody who has the answer."
I'll follow you anywhere, Mr. Gump.

1353
01:55:52,940 --> 01:55:54,780
<i>So, I got company.</i>

1354
01:55:56,610 --> 01:56:02,450
<i>And after that, I got more company.
And then, even more people joined in.</i>

1355
01:56:04,910 --> 01:56:08,120
Somebody later told me it gave people hope.

1356
01:56:09,920 --> 01:56:13,290
Now... Now, I don't know anything about that,

1357
01:56:14,130 --> 01:56:16,710
<i>but some of those people
asked me if I could help them out.</i>

1358
01:56:16,920 --> 01:56:20,180
Hey, man, hey, listen, I was wondering
if you might help me, huh?

1359
01:56:20,260 --> 01:56:22,010
Listen, I'm in the bumper sticker business

1360
01:56:22,100 --> 01:56:23,850
and I've been trying to think up a good slogan.

1361
01:56:23,930 --> 01:56:27,060
And since you have been such a big inspiration
to the people around here,

1362
01:56:27,140 --> 01:56:29,060
I thought you might be able
to help me jump into...

1363
01:56:29,140 --> 01:56:32,770
Whoa, man! You just ran through
a big pile of dog shit!

1364
01:56:34,320 --> 01:56:36,980
- It happens.
- What, shit?

1365
01:56:38,490 --> 01:56:40,450
Sometimes.

1366
01:56:42,320 --> 01:56:44,990
<i>And some years later,
I heard that that fellow</i>

1367
01:56:45,080 --> 01:56:46,700
<i>did come up with a bumper sticker slogan,</i>

1368
01:56:46,790 --> 01:56:50,000
<i>and he made a lot of money off of it.</i>

1369
01:56:51,460 --> 01:56:53,670
<i>Another time, I was running along,</i>

1370
01:56:53,790 --> 01:56:57,090
<i>somebody who had lost all his money
in the T-shirt business,</i>

1371
01:56:57,170 --> 01:56:59,210
<i>he wanted to put my face on a T-shirt,</i>

1372
01:56:59,300 --> 01:57:02,260
<i>but he couldn't draw that well,
and he didn't have a camera.</i>

1373
01:57:02,340 --> 01:57:05,850
Here, use this one.
Nobody likes that color anyway.

1374
01:57:10,690 --> 01:57:12,350
Have a nice day.

1375
01:57:13,980 --> 01:57:15,110
<i>Well, some years later,</i>

1376
01:57:15,190 --> 01:57:19,110
<i>I found out that that man
did come up with an idea for a T-shirt.</i>

1377
01:57:19,190 --> 01:57:21,570
<i>He made a lot of money off of it.</i>

1378
01:57:24,370 --> 01:57:28,790
<i>Anyway, like I was saying,
I had a lot of company.</i>

1379
01:57:30,040 --> 01:57:31,210
<i>My mama always said,</i>

1380
01:57:31,290 --> 01:57:35,710
<i>"You got to put the past behind you
before you can move on."</i>

1381
01:57:37,380 --> 01:57:40,710
<i>And I think that's what my running
was all about.</i>

1382
01:57:41,550 --> 01:57:45,550
<i>I had run for three years, two months,</i>

1383
01:57:45,800 --> 01:57:48,140
<i>14 days and 16 hours.</i>

1384
01:58:03,820 --> 01:58:06,160
Quiet. Quiet. He's going to say something.

1385
01:58:17,590 --> 01:58:19,340
I'm pretty tired.

1386
01:58:22,170 --> 01:58:24,220
Think I'll go home now.

1387
01:58:42,780 --> 01:58:45,240
Now what are we supposed to do?

1388
01:58:46,200 --> 01:58:50,450
<i>And just like that,
my running days was over.</i>

1389
01:58:52,410 --> 01:58:54,160
<i>So, I went home to Alabama.</i>

1390
01:58:54,960 --> 01:58:59,130
<i>Moments ago, at 2:25 p.m.,
as President Reagan was leaving the...</i>

1391
01:59:00,880 --> 01:59:05,050
<i>...five or six gunshots were fired
by an unknown would-be assassin.</i>

1392
01:59:05,550 --> 01:59:07,890
<i>The President was shot in the chest,
and the assailant...</i>

1393
01:59:07,970 --> 01:59:09,930
I picked up the mail.

1394
01:59:10,720 --> 01:59:14,560
And one day, out of the blue clear sky,
I got a letter from Jenny,

1395
01:59:14,640 --> 01:59:18,900
wondering if I could come down to Savannah
and see her,

1396
01:59:18,980 --> 01:59:21,570
and that's what I'm doing here.

1397
01:59:21,650 --> 01:59:24,230
She saw me on TV, running.

1398
01:59:24,320 --> 01:59:28,570
I'm supposed to go on the
number nine bus to Richmond Street

1399
01:59:28,660 --> 01:59:35,580
and get off and go one block left
to 1947 Henry Street, Apartment 4.

1400
01:59:35,660 --> 01:59:39,330
Why, you don't need to take a bus.

1401
01:59:39,460 --> 01:59:44,000
Henry Street is just five
or six blocks down that way.

1402
01:59:45,840 --> 01:59:48,180
- Down that way?
- Down that way.

1403
01:59:51,180 --> 01:59:53,100
It was nice talking to you.

1404
01:59:54,140 --> 01:59:56,770
I hope everything works out for you!

1405
02:00:04,530 --> 02:00:06,190
Hey!

1406
02:00:06,610 --> 02:00:08,280
Forrest!

1407
02:00:08,530 --> 02:00:11,780
How you doing? Come in, come in!

1408
02:00:11,870 --> 02:00:13,080
I got your letter.

1409
02:00:13,160 --> 02:00:15,790
I was wondering about that.

1410
02:00:17,330 --> 02:00:19,120
Is this your house?

1411
02:00:19,210 --> 02:00:22,290
Yeah. It's messy right now.
I just got off work.

1412
02:00:22,380 --> 02:00:26,090
It's nice. You got air conditioning.

1413
02:00:32,970 --> 02:00:35,010
- Thank you.
- I ate some.

1414
02:00:37,810 --> 02:00:43,230
Hey, I kept a scrapbook
of your clippings and everything.

1415
02:00:43,360 --> 02:00:44,980
There you are.

1416
02:00:46,730 --> 02:00:47,820
And this, I got you running.

1417
02:00:50,910 --> 02:00:53,070
I ran a long way,

1418
02:00:53,570 --> 02:00:55,410
for a long time.

1419
02:00:57,620 --> 02:00:59,120
And there...

1420
02:01:05,630 --> 02:01:09,090
Listen, Forrest,
I don't know how to say this.

1421
02:01:11,590 --> 02:01:15,930
I just I want to apologize
for anything that I ever did to you,

1422
02:01:16,060 --> 02:01:21,310
'cause I was messed up for a long time, and...

1423
02:01:24,110 --> 02:01:25,730
- Hey.
- Hi.

1424
02:01:25,940 --> 02:01:26,940
Hey, you.

1425
02:01:28,110 --> 02:01:31,070
- This is an old friend from Alabama.
- How do you do?

1426
02:01:31,150 --> 02:01:34,240
Listen, next week my schedule changes,
so I'll be able to... But thanks...

1427
02:01:34,320 --> 02:01:36,370
No problem. Got to go, Jen,
I'm double-parked.

1428
02:01:36,450 --> 02:01:38,330
- Okay. Thanks.
- Bye.

1429
02:01:41,790 --> 02:01:44,540
This is my very good friend, Mr. Gump.
Can you say hi to him?

1430
02:01:44,630 --> 02:01:47,710
- Hello, Mr. Gump.
- Hello.

1431
02:01:47,800 --> 02:01:50,800
- Can I go watch TV now?
- Yes, you can. Just keep it low.

1432
02:01:53,630 --> 02:01:56,970
- You're a mama, Jenny.
- I'm a mama.

1433
02:01:59,850 --> 02:02:01,680
His name's Forrest.

1434
02:02:02,810 --> 02:02:04,140
Like me.

1435
02:02:05,770 --> 02:02:07,900
I named him after his daddy.

1436
02:02:08,860 --> 02:02:11,320
He got a daddy named Forrest, too?

1437
02:02:12,610 --> 02:02:14,650
You're his daddy, Forrest.

1438
02:02:29,130 --> 02:02:30,340
Hey.

1439
02:02:31,510 --> 02:02:34,380
Forrest, look at me.
Look at me, Forrest.

1440
02:02:36,970 --> 02:02:41,100
There's nothing you need to do, okay?
You didn't do anything wrong.

1441
02:02:41,640 --> 02:02:43,020
Okay?

1442
02:02:47,360 --> 02:02:49,230
Isn't he beautiful?

1443
02:02:50,230 --> 02:02:53,190
He's the most beautiful thing
I've ever seen.

1444
02:02:56,990 --> 02:02:58,070
But...

1445
02:03:01,740 --> 02:03:04,620
Is he smart, or...

1446
02:03:04,710 --> 02:03:08,710
He's very smart.
He's one of the smartest in his class.

1447
02:03:18,050 --> 02:03:20,510
Yeah, it's okay. Go talk to him.

1448
02:03:29,860 --> 02:03:32,690
- What are you watching?
- Bert and Ernie.

1449
02:03:55,800 --> 02:03:57,590
Forrest,

1450
02:03:59,050 --> 02:04:00,590
I'm sick.

1451
02:04:03,260 --> 02:04:06,890
What, do you have a cough due to a cold?

1452
02:04:06,980 --> 02:04:09,350
I have some kind of virus,

1453
02:04:09,440 --> 02:04:12,150
and the doctors don't...
They don't know what it is,

1454
02:04:12,270 --> 02:04:15,280
and there isn't anything
they can do about it.

1455
02:04:19,660 --> 02:04:21,950
You could come home with me.

1456
02:04:23,620 --> 02:04:29,290
Jenny, you and little Forrest
could come stay at my house in Greenbow.

1457
02:04:33,630 --> 02:04:36,420
I'll take care of you if you're sick.

1458
02:04:38,800 --> 02:04:41,090
Would you marry me, Forrest?

1459
02:04:46,350 --> 02:04:47,600
Okay.

1460
02:04:48,640 --> 02:04:50,310
Please take your seats.

1461
02:04:54,150 --> 02:04:56,480
Forrest? It's time to start.

1462
02:05:15,880 --> 02:05:17,460
Hi.

1463
02:05:18,340 --> 02:05:19,840
Your tie.

1464
02:05:32,400 --> 02:05:34,020
Lieutenant Dan.

1465
02:05:49,370 --> 02:05:51,330
Lieutenant Dan.

1466
02:05:52,160 --> 02:05:53,830
Hello, Forrest.

1467
02:05:54,500 --> 02:05:57,170
You got new legs. New legs!

1468
02:05:58,380 --> 02:06:02,170
Yeah. I got new legs. Custom-made.

1469
02:06:02,880 --> 02:06:06,890
Titanium alloy.
It's what they use on the space shuttle.

1470
02:06:10,730 --> 02:06:12,230
Magic legs.

1471
02:06:14,230 --> 02:06:18,610
This is my fiancée, Susan.

1472
02:06:21,400 --> 02:06:24,780
- Lieutenant Dan.
- Hi, Forrest.

1473
02:06:26,870 --> 02:06:30,080
Lieutenant Dan, this is my Jenny.

1474
02:06:30,450 --> 02:06:33,460
Hey. It's nice to meet you finally.

1475
02:06:43,590 --> 02:06:47,760
Do you, Forrest,
take Jenny to be your wife?

1476
02:06:49,640 --> 02:06:53,890
Do you, Jenny,
take Forrest to be your husband?

1477
02:06:55,230 --> 02:06:58,610
And so I pronounce you man and wife.

1478
02:07:29,470 --> 02:07:31,350
- Hey.
- Hey.

1479
02:07:45,030 --> 02:07:46,820
Hey, Forrest.

1480
02:07:52,160 --> 02:07:53,950
Were you scared in Vietnam?

1481
02:07:55,620 --> 02:07:57,960
Yes. Well, I...

1482
02:07:59,290 --> 02:08:01,000
I don't know.

1483
02:08:01,710 --> 02:08:06,670
<i>Sometimes it would stop raining long enough
for the stars to come out.</i>

1484
02:08:09,800 --> 02:08:11,850
<i>And then it was nice.</i>

1485
02:08:15,220 --> 02:08:19,190
It was like just before the sun
goes to bed down on the bayou.

1486
02:08:20,480 --> 02:08:24,360
<i>There was always
a million sparkles on the water.</i>

1487
02:08:26,150 --> 02:08:30,070
<i>Like that mountain lake.
It was so clear, Jenny,</i>

1488
02:08:30,200 --> 02:08:34,780
<i>it looked like there were two skies,
one on top of the other.</i>

1489
02:08:37,330 --> 02:08:40,370
And then, in the desert,
when the sun comes up,

1490
02:08:42,840 --> 02:08:47,010
<i>I couldn't tell where heaven stopped</i>

1491
02:08:47,550 --> 02:08:49,920
<i>and the earth began.</i>

1492
02:08:51,180 --> 02:08:53,050
<i>It was so beautiful.</i>

1493
02:08:57,770 --> 02:09:00,850
I wish I could've been there with you.

1494
02:09:03,940 --> 02:09:05,360
You were.

1495
02:09:16,080 --> 02:09:17,540
I love you.

1496
02:09:21,920 --> 02:09:25,250
<i>You died on a Saturday morning.</i>

1497
02:09:26,960 --> 02:09:30,720
And I had you placed here under our tree.

1498
02:09:35,600 --> 02:09:40,430
And I had that house of your father's
bulldozed to the ground.

1499
02:09:44,560 --> 02:09:46,230
<i>Mama</i>

1500
02:09:47,320 --> 02:09:52,320
always said that dying was a part of life.

1501
02:09:55,740 --> 02:09:58,080
I sure wish it wasn't.

1502
02:10:00,750 --> 02:10:04,500
Little Forrest is doing just fine.

1503
02:10:05,830 --> 02:10:06,920
But...

1504
02:10:07,170 --> 02:10:09,840
<i>About to start school again soon,</i>

1505
02:10:11,670 --> 02:10:15,470
and I make his breakfast, lunch
and dinner every day.

1506
02:10:17,640 --> 02:10:23,640
I make sure he combs his hair
and brushes his teeth every day.

1507
02:10:26,770 --> 02:10:29,360
Teaching him how to play Ping-Pong.

1508
02:10:30,650 --> 02:10:31,690
Okay.

1509
02:10:31,940 --> 02:10:33,110
<i>He's really good.</i>

1510
02:10:33,200 --> 02:10:35,320
Forrest, you go.

1511
02:10:39,540 --> 02:10:41,120
<i>We fish a lot.</i>

1512
02:10:44,670 --> 02:10:48,130
And every night, we read a book.
He's so smart, Jenny.

1513
02:10:51,380 --> 02:10:53,630
You'd be so proud of him.

1514
02:10:55,340 --> 02:10:56,800
I am.

1515
02:10:57,850 --> 02:11:01,060
He wrote you a letter.

1516
02:11:02,640 --> 02:11:04,680
And he says I can't read it.

1517
02:11:04,810 --> 02:11:08,350
I'm not supposed to,
so I'll just leave it here for you.

1518
02:11:24,410 --> 02:11:25,750
Jenny,

1519
02:11:31,550 --> 02:11:34,760
I don't know if Mama was right,

1520
02:11:36,090 --> 02:11:37,590
or if it's Lieutenant Dan.

1521
02:11:37,720 --> 02:11:40,300
I don't know

1522
02:11:40,390 --> 02:11:44,890
if we each have a destiny,

1523
02:11:46,940 --> 02:11:52,070
or if we're all just floating around
accidental-like on a breeze.

1524
02:11:56,570 --> 02:11:58,400
But I think

1525
02:12:00,280 --> 02:12:02,080
maybe it's both.

1526
02:12:06,410 --> 02:12:09,290
Maybe both is happening
at the same time.

1527
02:12:15,420 --> 02:12:17,420
But I miss you, Jenny.

1528
02:12:23,810 --> 02:12:28,230
If there's anything you need,
I won't be far away.

1529
02:13:03,510 --> 02:13:06,470
Here's your bus. Okay.

1530
02:13:08,140 --> 02:13:11,480
Hey. I know this.

1531
02:13:11,600 --> 02:13:14,480
I'm gonna show that
for show-and-tell because

1532
02:13:14,610 --> 02:13:17,280
Grandma used to read it to you.

1533
02:13:17,360 --> 02:13:19,490
My favorite book.

1534
02:13:22,820 --> 02:13:24,320
Here we are.

1535
02:13:24,490 --> 02:13:25,950
Okay.

1536
02:13:27,660 --> 02:13:29,160
Here you go.

1537
02:13:34,040 --> 02:13:36,540
Hey, Forrest, don't...

1538
02:13:40,010 --> 02:13:43,720
- I wanted to tell you, I love you.
- I love you, too, Daddy.

1539
02:13:45,720 --> 02:13:48,510
I'll be right here when you get back.

1540
02:13:53,060 --> 02:13:56,310
You understand this is the bus to school,
now, don't you?

1541
02:13:56,400 --> 02:13:59,940
Of course, and you are Dorothy Harris,
and I'm Forrest Gump.
