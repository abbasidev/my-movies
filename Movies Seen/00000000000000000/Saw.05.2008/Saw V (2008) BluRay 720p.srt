1
00:01:35,510 --> 00:01:38,028
Fuck. What the fuck?

2
00:01:40,105 --> 00:01:42,423
What the...? What the fuck?

3
00:01:46,339 --> 00:01:47,737
What the...?

4
00:01:49,096 --> 00:01:50,934
What the fuck!

5
00:01:51,174 --> 00:01:52,413
Fuck.

6
00:01:54,410 --> 00:01:55,849
Hello?

7
00:01:57,168 --> 00:01:58,726
Fuck.

8
00:02:05,718 --> 00:02:06,694
<i>Hello,
Seth.</i>

9
00:02:07,956 --> 00:02:09,235
<i>I wanna play a game.</i>

10
00:02:09,475 --> 00:02:11,633
<i>Right now, you're feeling helpless.</i>

11
00:02:11,872 --> 00:02:13,671
<i>- This is the same helplessness...
- Help!</i>

12
00:02:13,869 --> 00:02:15,748
<i>... you've bestowed onto others.</i>

13
00:02:15,947 --> 00:02:17,985
<i>But now it's onto you.</i>

14
00:02:18,185 --> 00:02:21,941
<i>Some call this karma. I call it justice.</i>

15
00:02:22,141 --> 00:02:24,139
<i>Now, you served five years...</i>

16
00:02:24,338 --> 00:02:27,296
<i>... of what should have been
a life sentence for murder.</i>

17
00:02:27,536 --> 00:02:29,574
<i>A technicality gave you freedom...</i>

18
00:02:29,773 --> 00:02:32,610
<i>... but it inhibited you
from understanding...</i>

19
00:02:32,810 --> 00:02:34,808
<i>... the impact of taking a life.</i>

20
00:02:35,007 --> 00:02:37,965
<i>Today, I offer you true freedom.</i>

21
00:02:38,165 --> 00:02:43,719
<i>In 30 seconds, the pendulum will drop
far enough to touch your body.</i>

22
00:02:43,918 --> 00:02:48,234
<i>Within sixty seconds
it will cut you in half.</i>

23
00:02:48,913 --> 00:02:50,232
<i>To avoid the pendulum...</i>

24
00:02:50,432 --> 00:02:54,268
<i>... all you have to do
is destroy the things that have killed.</i>

25
00:02:54,467 --> 00:02:56,146
<i>Your hands.</i>

26
00:02:56,345 --> 00:02:59,662
<i>You must insert your hands
and push the buttons...</i>

27
00:02:59,861 --> 00:03:01,300
<i>... to start the devices before you.</i>

28
00:03:01,539 --> 00:03:04,097
<i>Your bones will be crushed to dust.</i>

29
00:03:04,297 --> 00:03:08,293
<i>Will you destroy the things that have
taken life in order to save one, Seth?</i>

30
00:03:08,533 --> 00:03:09,611
<i>Make your choice.</i>

31
00:03:13,167 --> 00:03:14,646
No.

32
00:03:38,101 --> 00:03:40,219
It was an accident!

33
00:03:45,932 --> 00:03:47,412
Please.

34
00:03:53,924 --> 00:03:54,923
Okay. Fuck you.

35
00:04:08,429 --> 00:04:11,266
Okay. Okay. Okay.

36
00:05:37,655 --> 00:05:40,212
I did what I was supposed to do.

37
00:06:08,982 --> 00:06:11,419
Let me see your hands.
Let me see your fucking hands.

38
00:06:11,619 --> 00:06:12,817
Where is my daughter? You...

39
00:06:23,966 --> 00:06:25,444
Jesus.

40
00:07:49,756 --> 00:07:51,474
<i>Hello, Agent Strahm.</i>

41
00:07:51,674 --> 00:07:52,672
<i>If you're hearing this...</i>

42
00:07:52,872 --> 00:07:55,429
<i>... then you've finally found
what you've been looking for.</i>

43
00:07:55,629 --> 00:07:59,105
<i>But is the discovery
of my body enough?</i>

44
00:07:59,345 --> 00:08:02,981
<i>Or will your insatiable hunger
to uncover the truth...</i>

45
00:08:03,181 --> 00:08:05,499
<i>... push you deeper into the abyss?</i>

46
00:08:05,699 --> 00:08:09,095
<i>Heed my warning: Do not proceed.</i>

47
00:08:09,295 --> 00:08:14,929
<i>For this room can either be
your sanctuary or it can be your grave.</i>

48
00:08:15,488 --> 00:08:17,246
<i>The choice is yours.</i>

49
00:08:20,084 --> 00:08:21,242
Fuck you.

50
00:09:27,692 --> 00:09:29,290
Hey!

51
00:09:30,090 --> 00:09:31,728
Help!

52
00:09:33,006 --> 00:09:35,404
Help!

53
00:09:36,004 --> 00:09:38,601
Help!

54
00:09:53,785 --> 00:09:55,543
Help!

55
00:11:20,773 --> 00:11:22,770
Go! Go!

56
00:11:25,168 --> 00:11:26,647
You're okay.

57
00:11:33,359 --> 00:11:35,077
- Where's my dad?
- He's gonna be okay.

58
00:11:35,277 --> 00:11:37,915
Where's my mom?
Where's my mom?

59
00:11:38,115 --> 00:11:41,271
- Hoffman.
- I got it. I got it.

60
00:11:42,990 --> 00:11:44,588
You okay to walk?

61
00:11:44,788 --> 00:11:46,946
What the hell, man?
What happened? Where's Rigg?

62
00:11:48,544 --> 00:11:51,820
Tried to help. He didn't make it.

63
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:54,138
Nobody made it.

64
00:11:55,017 --> 00:11:56,895
We got a live one.

65
00:12:37,452 --> 00:12:38,690
Hello?

66
00:12:39,130 --> 00:12:40,369
Right away.

67
00:12:40,808 --> 00:12:42,326
Ms. Tuck.

68
00:12:42,726 --> 00:12:44,165
Have a seat.

69
00:12:48,121 --> 00:12:50,478
It's nice to meet you, Mr. Feldman.

70
00:12:51,637 --> 00:12:52,796
Why am I here?

71
00:12:53,355 --> 00:12:55,513
I represent your ex-husband, John.

72
00:12:55,713 --> 00:13:00,068
In the event of his death,
I was instructed to contact you.

73
00:13:00,268 --> 00:13:05,103
You can understand my surprise
when I found out who he really was.

74
00:13:05,302 --> 00:13:07,420
John left something for you.

75
00:13:29,637 --> 00:13:33,992
<i>If you're watching this, Jill,
I'm long gone from this world.</i>

76
00:13:34,992 --> 00:13:40,266
<i>You are my heart, you always
have been. You always will be.</i>

77
00:13:41,504 --> 00:13:46,859
<i>I'm not going to try to explain
my actions of late.</i>

78
00:13:47,059 --> 00:13:51,334
<i>Suffice it to say that I find it difficult
to forgive myself...</i>

79
00:13:51,534 --> 00:13:53,172
<i>... for what happened at the clinic.</i>

80
00:13:53,931 --> 00:14:00,045
<i>I permitted, indeed, encouraged your
decisions regarding the people there.</i>

81
00:14:00,564 --> 00:14:04,560
<i>I saw danger and l...
I should have acted sooner.</i>

82
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:10,953
<i>I'm leaving you a box today, and
its contents are of grave importance.</i>

83
00:14:11,553 --> 00:14:14,989
<i>Even though you and I don't always see
eye to eye on everything...</i>

84
00:14:15,229 --> 00:14:18,665
<i>... I deeply believe in you
and I believe that you will know...</i>

85
00:14:18,865 --> 00:14:21,263
<i>... what to do with these materials.</i>

86
00:15:22,678 --> 00:15:25,115
I wanna thank you all
for coming here today.

87
00:15:25,634 --> 00:15:27,672
And I'd like to be the first to say...

88
00:15:27,872 --> 00:15:30,829
...that the Jigsaw murders are over.

89
00:15:32,667 --> 00:15:36,423
The officers who gave their lives
are being honored here today.

90
00:15:36,903 --> 00:15:39,939
But today I'd like to offer
a special honor...

91
00:15:40,139 --> 00:15:43,496
...to the detective who's been
on this case right from the beginning...

92
00:15:43,696 --> 00:15:47,332
...who proved through hard work
and dedication...

93
00:15:47,532 --> 00:15:50,768
...that the people who died
did not die in vain.

94
00:15:50,968 --> 00:15:55,283
Today we honor the newly promoted
Detective Lieutenant...

95
00:15:55,483 --> 00:15:57,521
...Mark Hoffman.

96
00:15:57,761 --> 00:15:59,239
Congratulations.

97
00:15:59,439 --> 00:16:01,277
Thank you so much.

98
00:16:09,828 --> 00:16:11,386
Thank you. Thank you very much.

99
00:16:14,583 --> 00:16:18,579
Throughout this ordeal,
if we've learned anything it's that...

100
00:16:18,778 --> 00:16:20,617
...human life is sacred.

101
00:16:21,496 --> 00:16:24,493
And we've learned that every day...

102
00:16:25,691 --> 00:16:27,849
...life should be cherished.

103
00:16:28,729 --> 00:16:30,367
Justice...

104
00:16:30,567 --> 00:16:34,642
...is the backbone
to every peaceful society.

105
00:16:35,881 --> 00:16:39,037
And I believe that true justice
has been served.

106
00:17:44,608 --> 00:17:47,045
Detective Hoffman,
you're wanted at the hospital.

107
00:17:47,245 --> 00:17:48,723
It's about Agent Perez.

108
00:17:48,923 --> 00:17:50,681
Thank you.

109
00:17:54,358 --> 00:18:00,152
<i>Hello, Agent Perez, and welcome
to the world that you have long studied.</i>

110
00:18:00,352 --> 00:18:02,310
<i>Heed my warning, Agent Perez.</i>

111
00:18:02,550 --> 00:18:05,626
<i>Your next move is critical.</i>

112
00:18:05,826 --> 00:18:07,624
<i>- Open the door.
- What is that?</i>

113
00:18:12,978 --> 00:18:14,577
I got you.

114
00:18:36,274 --> 00:18:39,430
I'm truly sorry about Agent Perez.

115
00:18:41,548 --> 00:18:42,987
She said your name, you know.

116
00:18:44,585 --> 00:18:47,302
The last thing she said
was "Detective Hoffman."

117
00:18:47,502 --> 00:18:50,738
Why'd she say that?
Why'd she say your name?

118
00:18:50,938 --> 00:18:53,136
- I don't know.
- No?

119
00:18:53,935 --> 00:18:56,372
How'd you walk out of that building?

120
00:18:56,572 --> 00:18:58,010
How did you?

121
00:18:58,210 --> 00:19:01,487
On a gurney with a fucking hole
in my throat.

122
00:19:03,285 --> 00:19:04,364
Look at you.

123
00:19:04,763 --> 00:19:07,721
Couple of scratches and a story
about how your arm straps broke.

124
00:19:07,921 --> 00:19:09,679
Jigsaw doesn't make mistakes.

125
00:19:09,919 --> 00:19:12,475
Is this you theorizing again?
Because Jigsaw's dead.

126
00:19:12,715 --> 00:19:13,794
I'm not talking about him...

127
00:19:13,994 --> 00:19:16,511
...l'm talking about you
and your whole crooked department.

128
00:19:16,751 --> 00:19:19,748
My department's gone. They're all dead.
There's no one left.

129
00:19:19,948 --> 00:19:21,506
Besides you.

130
00:19:22,384 --> 00:19:25,382
Been chasing Jigsaw
from the beginning...

131
00:19:25,582 --> 00:19:27,460
...and I got him.

132
00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:29,697
So unless you've got
something else to say...

133
00:19:30,416 --> 00:19:32,574
...back the fuck off.

134
00:19:34,213 --> 00:19:36,649
Read the papers.
I saved that little girl.

135
00:19:52,713 --> 00:19:54,711
Sorry about Agent Perez.

136
00:19:55,830 --> 00:19:57,827
Shouldn't you be resting?

137
00:19:58,747 --> 00:20:00,625
I'm fine, Erickson.

138
00:20:00,825 --> 00:20:04,181
No, you're not, Peter.
That's why I put you on medical leave.

139
00:20:07,617 --> 00:20:09,855
I was supposed to die in that trap.

140
00:20:10,494 --> 00:20:13,012
You never should have been there
without backup.

141
00:20:13,212 --> 00:20:16,008
I wanna talk to Jill Tuck one last time.

142
00:20:17,208 --> 00:20:19,804
You're no longer handling
the case, Peter.

143
00:20:20,484 --> 00:20:21,842
What?

144
00:20:22,042 --> 00:20:23,401
Read it.

145
00:20:26,437 --> 00:20:28,675
Over a dozen dead bodies
were recovered at the scene...

146
00:20:28,915 --> 00:20:29,993
...two of which were cops.

147
00:20:30,193 --> 00:20:33,709
Jigsaw's dead, how many lives
did I inevitably save?

148
00:20:33,909 --> 00:20:36,067
By endangering yourself and others.

149
00:20:36,267 --> 00:20:37,426
You're off the case.

150
00:20:37,626 --> 00:20:39,344
On whose orders?

151
00:20:39,544 --> 00:20:40,942
Mine.

152
00:20:42,420 --> 00:20:44,858
I'm sorry, Peter. It's over.

153
00:22:24,113 --> 00:22:25,392
Oh, my God.

154
00:22:31,346 --> 00:22:33,703
- What is this?
- Hey, don't move.

155
00:22:33,943 --> 00:22:35,821
What did you do to me?

156
00:22:36,021 --> 00:22:37,060
I didn't do anything.

157
00:22:37,499 --> 00:22:39,097
- It's Jigsaw.
- What?

158
00:22:39,337 --> 00:22:42,733
I knew this was gonna happen to me.
This is what he does.

159
00:22:43,853 --> 00:22:45,371
No, it's not Jigsaw.

160
00:22:47,569 --> 00:22:48,887
He's dead.

161
00:22:49,087 --> 00:22:51,324
Haven't you watched TV lately?

162
00:22:52,004 --> 00:22:53,642
Yeah, well, whoever it is...

163
00:22:54,442 --> 00:22:55,480
...they're watching us.

164
00:23:00,235 --> 00:23:01,993
To make sure we follow the rules.

165
00:23:02,193 --> 00:23:04,551
- Which are what?
- I wouldn't do that if I were you.

166
00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:07,188
Unless you want your head
to pop off like a dandelion.

167
00:23:07,387 --> 00:23:09,825
- How do you know that?
- Because I have eyes.

168
00:23:11,023 --> 00:23:13,501
One pull-pin starts the timer
for all of us.

169
00:23:15,299 --> 00:23:19,375
You won't wanna do that unless
you know how it works, now, would you?

170
00:23:19,934 --> 00:23:21,932
You're starting to freak me out, dude.

171
00:23:26,568 --> 00:23:27,566
<i>Hello, and welcome.</i>

172
00:23:27,966 --> 00:23:32,481
<i>From birth, you've all been given
the advantages of few others.</i>

173
00:23:32,681 --> 00:23:35,398
<i>Yet through poor moral decisions...</i>

174
00:23:35,597 --> 00:23:38,595
<i>... you've used these advantages
to selfishly further...</i>

175
00:23:38,795 --> 00:23:42,311
<i>... only yourselves
at the expense of others.</i>

176
00:23:42,511 --> 00:23:46,226
<i>Well, today this singular way of thinking
will be put to the test.</i>

177
00:23:46,426 --> 00:23:51,422
<i>Today, five will become one,
with a common goal of survival.</i>

178
00:23:51,620 --> 00:23:52,780
<i>You are all connected.</i>

179
00:23:52,980 --> 00:23:55,337
<i>A cable runs through
your collar devices.</i>

180
00:23:55,537 --> 00:23:57,215
<i>It can be pulled so tight...</i>

181
00:23:57,415 --> 00:24:00,252
<i>... that you will be decapitated
on the mounted razors.</i>

182
00:24:01,251 --> 00:24:05,766
<i>The only way to remove the collar
is with the keys from the glass boxes...</i>

183
00:24:05,965 --> 00:24:07,484
<i>... on the pedestals before you.</i>

184
00:24:07,684 --> 00:24:10,801
<i>However, if one of you moves
to retrieve a key...</i>

185
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:14,357
<i>... the 60-second timer
will begin for you all.</i>

186
00:24:14,916 --> 00:24:16,954
<i>In choosing how to react
to this situation...</i>

187
00:24:17,194 --> 00:24:20,190
<i>... your lifelong instincts
will tell you to do one thing...</i>

188
00:24:20,390 --> 00:24:23,507
<i>... but I implore you to do the opposite.</i>

189
00:24:24,746 --> 00:24:26,344
<i>Let the games begin.</i>

190
00:24:30,261 --> 00:24:32,218
Somebody has to die.

191
00:24:32,418 --> 00:24:35,974
No, no, no, it says,
"Don't listen to your instincts."

192
00:24:36,174 --> 00:24:38,571
- That means don't go for the keys.
- You fucking nuts?

193
00:24:38,771 --> 00:24:40,729
How are we supposed to live
if we don't?

194
00:24:40,929 --> 00:24:43,166
- It's testing our endurance.
- We gotta move, babe.

195
00:24:43,366 --> 00:24:45,364
That timer's connected to those jars.

196
00:24:45,564 --> 00:24:47,362
It didn't say anything
about those jars.

197
00:24:47,562 --> 00:24:49,680
- They could be nothing.
- They're nail bombs.

198
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:51,797
Homemade, probably C-4.

199
00:24:52,037 --> 00:24:53,595
How the fuck do you know that?

200
00:24:53,795 --> 00:24:56,952
She's a fire inspector.
She's seen all kinds of demented shit.

201
00:24:57,151 --> 00:24:59,029
How do you know me?

202
00:25:01,347 --> 00:25:04,344
Hey, man, she's asking you a question.
How do you know her?

203
00:25:07,261 --> 00:25:10,458
How do you know her? Answer me!

204
00:25:10,658 --> 00:25:12,896
Look, let's just keep our cool.

205
00:25:13,095 --> 00:25:16,252
- Okay, we can figure this out.
- We're all here for a reason.

206
00:25:16,971 --> 00:25:19,968
Okay, and we're all connected,
as the message said.

207
00:25:20,167 --> 00:25:21,805
We just need to...

208
00:25:24,083 --> 00:25:27,041
- What did you do?
- You go first.

209
00:25:30,277 --> 00:25:33,354
It said that we were all born
with advantages.

210
00:25:33,913 --> 00:25:35,831
Right? That means
we're all from money.

211
00:25:38,988 --> 00:25:40,506
- I'm not.
- And neither am I.

212
00:25:40,706 --> 00:25:43,463
Hey, nice fucking try, Nancy Drew.

213
00:25:43,663 --> 00:25:45,461
Well, then, what does it mean?

214
00:25:45,661 --> 00:25:48,218
We did something wrong
with an advantage from birth.

215
00:25:48,417 --> 00:25:51,855
- That doesn't have to mean money.
- What are you not telling us?

216
00:25:52,333 --> 00:25:55,371
You know about her, what do you know
about the rest of us?

217
00:25:55,570 --> 00:25:58,167
Would you fucking talk to me?

218
00:25:58,367 --> 00:26:01,284
- Relax.
- I am fucking relaxed.

219
00:26:01,484 --> 00:26:03,682
It's a game, tweaker.

220
00:26:04,162 --> 00:26:08,356
Get it? The less you know about me,
the better.

221
00:26:08,596 --> 00:26:11,513
The reason why you fucked up
your charmed existence...

222
00:26:11,713 --> 00:26:13,991
...is pretty obvious to everyone, isn't it?

223
00:26:15,829 --> 00:26:17,627
Fuck you. Fuck you.

224
00:26:17,827 --> 00:26:20,025
Been playing with matches again,
have we?

225
00:26:20,663 --> 00:26:22,502
Fuck all of you and your fucking plan.

226
00:28:09,069 --> 00:28:11,627
Unless you wanna be shredded
when those bombs go off...

227
00:28:12,186 --> 00:28:14,424
...I suggest we move on.

228
00:28:34,842 --> 00:28:36,321
What are you doing?

229
00:28:36,521 --> 00:28:38,279
Being smart.

230
00:28:47,868 --> 00:28:49,467
Special Agent Strahm's office.

231
00:28:49,666 --> 00:28:53,343
This is Detective Hoffman.
Is Agent Strahm available?

232
00:28:53,543 --> 00:28:56,179
He's not, but I can connect you
to Special Agent Erickson.

233
00:28:56,379 --> 00:28:57,857
He's handling all inquiries.

234
00:28:58,057 --> 00:28:59,417
Please.

235
00:29:01,574 --> 00:29:03,971
<i>You've reached the voice mail box
of Agent Erickson.</i>

236
00:29:04,171 --> 00:29:06,209
<i>Please leave a message.</i>

237
00:29:06,449 --> 00:29:08,886
Yeah, this is Detective Hoffman.

238
00:29:09,086 --> 00:29:11,564
I needed to discuss something
with Agent Strahm...

239
00:29:11,764 --> 00:29:13,642
...but I can't seem to track him down.

240
00:29:13,841 --> 00:29:17,198
Could you give me a call?
It would be greatly appreciated.

241
00:30:17,414 --> 00:30:19,571
There you are.

242
00:31:07,081 --> 00:31:09,239
Sister.

243
00:31:39,607 --> 00:31:40,965
Peter.

244
00:31:43,723 --> 00:31:46,880
- Cowan, take this to analysis.
- Right away, sir.

245
00:31:48,998 --> 00:31:50,236
What are you doing here?

246
00:31:50,436 --> 00:31:54,871
Just grabbing some stuff from the office.
I'm taking your advice.

247
00:31:55,790 --> 00:32:00,265
- Taking some time off, huh?
- Yeah, well, I have to heal up, you know.

248
00:32:00,865 --> 00:32:03,941
You know, I'll keep in touch.
I'll see you around.

249
00:33:34,166 --> 00:33:35,565
Hoffman.

250
00:33:35,804 --> 00:33:39,480
We got another body.
Looks like another Jigsaw victim.

251
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:42,877
- You up for this?
- Yeah.

252
00:33:43,996 --> 00:33:45,434
Typical bio. Murder convict.

253
00:33:45,634 --> 00:33:48,151
Served five years,
just released last month.

254
00:33:51,668 --> 00:33:53,227
I know him.

255
00:33:53,586 --> 00:33:55,823
His name's Seth Baxter.

256
00:33:56,303 --> 00:33:58,621
My sister's ex-boyfriend.

257
00:34:00,059 --> 00:34:02,536
This is the guy
that murdered your sister?

258
00:34:02,736 --> 00:34:07,731
He was sentenced to 25 years.
Got it reduced to five on a technicality.

259
00:34:09,330 --> 00:34:11,807
Well, then I'd say justice was served.

260
00:34:21,637 --> 00:34:25,632
You killed him.
Made it look like a Jigsaw trap.

261
00:34:28,190 --> 00:34:29,908
I got you.

262
00:34:35,382 --> 00:34:36,460
Not yet.

263
00:34:36,700 --> 00:34:38,858
Don't close the door.
It'll set off the timer.

264
00:34:39,098 --> 00:34:41,535
- Do you know that for sure?
- Educated guess.

265
00:34:41,735 --> 00:34:43,933
What we need to do
is figure out who everyone is.

266
00:34:44,133 --> 00:34:47,689
Okay, well, we know that the dead
woman worked for the fire department.

267
00:34:47,889 --> 00:34:50,246
Not anymore.
She got canned a month ago.

268
00:34:50,446 --> 00:34:52,883
How the fuck do you...?
How the fuck do you know that?

269
00:34:53,083 --> 00:34:55,920
You're responsible for this?
She had her fucking head cut off!

270
00:34:56,120 --> 00:34:57,198
I'm closing the door.

271
00:34:57,398 --> 00:34:59,996
- I'm gonna close the fucking door!
- Just be quiet.

272
00:35:01,434 --> 00:35:03,032
Please.

273
00:35:07,228 --> 00:35:08,387
What's your story?

274
00:35:08,587 --> 00:35:10,585
I work for
the Department of City Planning.

275
00:35:10,785 --> 00:35:14,940
- Married? Kids?
- No, and no. Your turn.

276
00:35:15,140 --> 00:35:17,857
You're not gonna tell them
about Daddy?

277
00:35:20,894 --> 00:35:25,210
- My dad is Richard Gibbs.
- The owner of the Cougars?

278
00:35:25,410 --> 00:35:29,684
He's been trying to build a new stadium
for years. Little did he know...

279
00:35:29,884 --> 00:35:35,199
...all he had to do is wait for his daughter
to get a job in City Planning.

280
00:35:36,517 --> 00:35:39,035
And you. What about you?

281
00:35:39,235 --> 00:35:41,433
What sort of shady shit
have you been up to?

282
00:35:41,632 --> 00:35:44,509
I'm a senior V.P.
for a real estate development company.

283
00:35:44,709 --> 00:35:46,107
So you're boring too.

284
00:35:48,824 --> 00:35:52,460
The Marshvard Group. Yeah,
you can't get a permit in this town...

285
00:35:52,660 --> 00:35:55,817
...without going through
the Department of City Planning.

286
00:35:56,017 --> 00:35:58,654
- Right?
- No, you can't.

287
00:35:58,854 --> 00:36:00,412
What about you?

288
00:36:02,330 --> 00:36:04,009
No wife.

289
00:36:04,208 --> 00:36:09,922
- No kids that I know of. No job.
- Trust-fund baby. Anyone surprised?

290
00:36:10,122 --> 00:36:12,399
I'm so fucking sick of
your self-righteousness.

291
00:36:12,599 --> 00:36:13,718
It's your turn.

292
00:36:13,958 --> 00:36:18,752
<i>I'm an investigative journalist
for The Herald.</i>

293
00:36:18,952 --> 00:36:22,389
<i>Herald? That's your accomplishment?
You work for a gossip rag?</i>

294
00:36:22,588 --> 00:36:24,387
Bite your fucking tongue.

295
00:36:24,587 --> 00:36:27,064
What the hell are in those jars?

296
00:36:28,183 --> 00:36:31,619
Let's do this fucking thing
before the bombs go off.

297
00:36:38,332 --> 00:36:39,251
Fuck!

298
00:36:40,929 --> 00:36:43,806
<i>Hello, and welcome to the next lesson.</i>

299
00:36:44,046 --> 00:36:47,122
<i>These walls hold four chambers.</i>

300
00:36:49,001 --> 00:36:50,679
<i>These chambers are for safety.</i>

301
00:36:50,919 --> 00:36:53,756
<i>However, to access them,
a key is needed.</i>

302
00:36:53,956 --> 00:36:57,472
<i>But only three of the keys
will fit the locks.</i>

303
00:36:57,631 --> 00:37:01,347
<i>These keys are in the glass jars
hanging from the ceiling.</i>

304
00:37:01,627 --> 00:37:04,664
<i>Move quickly, though,
because when the clock ticks down...</i>

305
00:37:04,904 --> 00:37:09,539
<i>... the explosives in the corners
of the room will detonate.</i>

306
00:37:09,739 --> 00:37:14,454
<i>With only three points of safety,
which of you will be the odd man out?</i>

307
00:37:15,214 --> 00:37:16,812
<i>Make your choice.</i>

308
00:37:20,008 --> 00:37:21,167
Fuck.

309
00:37:28,039 --> 00:37:30,757
Fuck, it's blank. I need a shape.

310
00:37:33,714 --> 00:37:36,111
Get your hands off that,
you're not going anywhere.

311
00:37:38,748 --> 00:37:41,106
- Stop it!
- Get a clue, you fucking bitch.

312
00:37:41,306 --> 00:37:43,304
It's survival of the fittest.

313
00:37:58,647 --> 00:38:00,406
Blank.

314
00:38:01,604 --> 00:38:02,963
Blank.

315
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:07,678
Shit.

316
00:38:08,398 --> 00:38:10,395
I got it. Got it.

317
00:38:22,423 --> 00:38:24,301
Yes.

318
00:38:31,014 --> 00:38:33,850
Better luck next time, rich boy.

319
00:38:36,008 --> 00:38:37,726
Survival of the fittest, my ass!

320
00:38:51,591 --> 00:38:52,910
Wait.

321
00:39:17,125 --> 00:39:20,082
Everything all right with
Detective Kerr in the Seth Baxter case?

322
00:39:20,281 --> 00:39:21,360
- Yeah.
- Good.

323
00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:24,397
Fisk. You keep me posted.

324
00:39:24,596 --> 00:39:27,114
- Will do.
- Good.

325
00:39:27,314 --> 00:39:32,029
After Seth,
you were involved in every investigation.

326
00:39:40,381 --> 00:39:42,498
When did you first meet Jigsaw?

327
00:40:46,910 --> 00:40:49,148
Stop it, stop it!

328
00:40:59,937 --> 00:41:01,335
Don't!

329
00:41:06,050 --> 00:41:09,126
Heel! Heel, I said!

330
00:41:09,326 --> 00:41:11,204
Don't provoke him. Asshole!

331
00:41:12,284 --> 00:41:15,400
Jesus Christ.
Come on, Peewee. Come on.

332
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:17,957
- Come on, Peewee.
- Peewee.

333
00:41:18,157 --> 00:41:19,516
Shit.

334
00:41:23,631 --> 00:41:25,669
Do you mind?

335
00:41:31,983 --> 00:41:34,060
- Going up?
- Yes, thank you.

336
00:41:55,277 --> 00:41:57,355
What floor are you going to?

337
00:42:07,784 --> 00:42:10,981
I think we're both going
to the same place.

338
00:42:43,067 --> 00:42:45,465
You know why you're here, don't you?

339
00:42:47,663 --> 00:42:52,098
They say imitation
is the sincerest form of flattery.

340
00:42:54,016 --> 00:42:57,332
But I find it somewhat distasteful...

341
00:42:57,532 --> 00:43:00,330
...to be given credit for work
that's not mine.

342
00:43:06,203 --> 00:43:08,321
Especially inferior work.

343
00:43:13,195 --> 00:43:16,752
Like you,
I know what it's like to lose family.

344
00:43:18,231 --> 00:43:21,547
I know what it's like
not to be able to protect loved ones.

345
00:43:22,506 --> 00:43:25,103
It's a powerless feeling.

346
00:43:30,298 --> 00:43:31,456
I wouldn't do that.

347
00:43:37,650 --> 00:43:39,009
Hair trigger.

348
00:43:41,885 --> 00:43:43,723
What do you see?

349
00:43:47,439 --> 00:43:50,476
Vengeance can change a person.
Make you into something...

350
00:43:50,676 --> 00:43:53,593
...you never thought
you were capable of being.

351
00:43:55,232 --> 00:43:58,628
But unlike you, I've never killed anyone.

352
00:43:58,828 --> 00:44:02,104
- I give people a chance.
- You call this a chance?

353
00:44:02,304 --> 00:44:04,182
We'll see.

354
00:44:05,381 --> 00:44:10,415
- Our game's just begun.
- Our game? You don't even know me.

355
00:44:12,533 --> 00:44:17,288
I know you.
I've followed you as you've pursued me.

356
00:44:17,488 --> 00:44:20,524
I know you. I know about your sister.

357
00:44:20,764 --> 00:44:23,162
I know how you cared for her.

358
00:44:29,635 --> 00:44:31,553
I know she was your only family.

359
00:44:31,793 --> 00:44:33,591
Leave me alone.

360
00:44:37,147 --> 00:44:38,505
No!

361
00:44:46,178 --> 00:44:50,214
You sit in bars until closing.
You drink so you can sleep.

362
00:44:50,413 --> 00:44:51,892
You stagger to your car...

363
00:44:52,091 --> 00:44:56,127
...and then you start it all over again
the next day.

364
00:44:59,523 --> 00:45:02,959
Then I discovered
what you do for recreation.

365
00:45:09,473 --> 00:45:11,191
You can dispense justice...

366
00:45:11,391 --> 00:45:15,386
...and give people a chance
to value their lives in the same moment.

367
00:45:17,185 --> 00:45:18,983
And by the way...

368
00:45:19,742 --> 00:45:22,259
...the blade on your pendulum
was inferior.

369
00:45:23,778 --> 00:45:26,655
If you want a true edge...

370
00:45:29,691 --> 00:45:31,849
...you have to used tempered steel.

371
00:45:32,089 --> 00:45:35,046
Tempering's better for the long haul.

372
00:45:35,246 --> 00:45:37,244
You in this for the long haul, detective?

373
00:45:38,842 --> 00:45:41,998
I've been a cop for 20 years.
Is that long enough for you?

374
00:45:42,198 --> 00:45:46,234
Then you and I both know the statistics
for repeat offenders in this city.

375
00:45:46,434 --> 00:45:51,509
67.5 percent of criminals
are back in prison within three years.

376
00:45:51,709 --> 00:45:53,187
What do you want from me?

377
00:45:53,787 --> 00:45:57,383
So you might look at what you did
to Seth as a kind of public service.

378
00:45:59,101 --> 00:46:02,177
She was my only family.
He didn't deserve a chance.

379
00:46:02,457 --> 00:46:05,014
- He was an animal.
- Everybody deserves a chance!

380
00:46:05,214 --> 00:46:07,092
You didn't see the blood!

381
00:46:07,292 --> 00:46:09,490
You didn't see
what he fucking did to her!

382
00:46:09,690 --> 00:46:13,086
Killing is distasteful...

383
00:46:14,644 --> 00:46:16,163
...to me.

384
00:46:19,279 --> 00:46:23,395
There is a better, more efficient way.

385
00:46:31,386 --> 00:46:33,984
What do you see...? Look!

386
00:46:34,424 --> 00:46:37,620
- What do you see?
- Tell me what you want.

387
00:46:39,578 --> 00:46:44,013
I wanna know if you have
what it takes to survive.

388
00:47:03,552 --> 00:47:05,590
Fuck you.

389
00:47:05,790 --> 00:47:07,069
Fuck you.

390
00:47:09,067 --> 00:47:11,584
You see, it's a different method
that I'm talking about.

391
00:47:12,303 --> 00:47:14,221
If a subject survives my method...

392
00:47:14,701 --> 00:47:17,179
...he or she is instantly rehabilitated.

393
00:47:19,296 --> 00:47:21,334
Now, you want a chance?

394
00:47:22,812 --> 00:47:24,410
You want a chance?

395
00:47:24,650 --> 00:47:25,769
I'll give you a chance.

396
00:47:34,200 --> 00:47:37,237
I'm the man you call Jigsaw.

397
00:47:38,955 --> 00:47:41,113
It's your duty to bring me in...

398
00:47:41,353 --> 00:47:44,030
...but I know who you are...

399
00:47:44,229 --> 00:47:46,707
...and I know what you've done.

400
00:47:50,583 --> 00:47:51,982
So this is blackmail.

401
00:47:52,182 --> 00:47:53,260
No, no, no.

402
00:47:54,698 --> 00:47:56,936
This is redemption.

403
00:48:01,012 --> 00:48:04,009
Just giving you an option, that's all.

404
00:48:04,808 --> 00:48:07,205
Now, you can arrest me...

405
00:48:07,405 --> 00:48:11,481
...but doing so,
your life ends as you know it.

406
00:48:11,681 --> 00:48:12,999
Or...

407
00:48:13,199 --> 00:48:14,598
...you could explore...

408
00:48:15,876 --> 00:48:18,194
...a method of rehabilitation...

409
00:48:18,394 --> 00:48:20,712
...that'll permit you to sleep at night.

410
00:48:42,448 --> 00:48:44,007
Or I could kill you right now.

411
00:48:44,246 --> 00:48:46,604
But you're not a true killer.

412
00:48:47,602 --> 00:48:48,842
That's your dilemma...

413
00:48:49,042 --> 00:48:52,478
...and the information that I have on you
is exactly where it needs to be...

414
00:48:52,678 --> 00:48:56,793
...and it will be released
in the event of my disappearance.

415
00:48:57,553 --> 00:49:00,069
They'll never believe your word
over mine.

416
00:49:02,587 --> 00:49:04,705
You willing to take that risk?

417
00:49:04,905 --> 00:49:06,983
Risk of ruining your own life...

418
00:49:07,182 --> 00:49:09,620
...in order to protect
a corrupt legal system...

419
00:49:09,820 --> 00:49:13,336
...that puts murderers
back on the streets?

420
00:49:19,090 --> 00:49:21,168
How would your sister feel?

421
00:49:21,367 --> 00:49:23,365
You're at a crossroads, detective.

422
00:49:24,164 --> 00:49:26,242
Make your choice.

423
00:49:48,658 --> 00:49:51,096
Did you help Jigsaw get all of them?

424
00:50:38,006 --> 00:50:41,722
<i>Detective Hoffman,
this is Special Agent Erickson.</i>

425
00:50:41,922 --> 00:50:45,559
You had something you needed
to discuss about the Jigsaw case?

426
00:50:45,758 --> 00:50:48,795
Yes. I stopped by Agent Strahm's room
tonight at the hospital...

427
00:50:48,995 --> 00:50:50,073
...but he wasn't there.

428
00:50:50,273 --> 00:50:52,471
<i>- I hope he's all right.
- Oh, yeah, he's fine.</i>

429
00:50:52,671 --> 00:50:55,068
Agent Strahm was theorizing
about the possibility...

430
00:50:55,268 --> 00:50:58,465
...of an additional accomplice
to Jigsaw, other than Amanda Young.

431
00:50:59,304 --> 00:51:02,180
<i>Someone who might be
currently unknown.</i>

432
00:51:02,380 --> 00:51:05,098
<i>Did he ever mention
anything like that to you?</i>

433
00:51:05,338 --> 00:51:08,374
<i>- No, but then again, I'm new to the case.
- Yeah, well...</i>

434
00:51:08,574 --> 00:51:11,331
...maybe you could get him to
contact me at his earliest convenience.

435
00:51:11,531 --> 00:51:13,849
Will do. And...

436
00:51:14,049 --> 00:51:16,167
...in your theorizing...

437
00:51:16,365 --> 00:51:18,843
...who exactly did you suspect
would be an accomplice?

438
00:51:20,601 --> 00:51:23,039
Well, he suspected
someone on the inside.

439
00:51:23,239 --> 00:51:24,438
<i>Someone with access.</i>

440
00:51:24,637 --> 00:51:26,875
It's an interesting theory.

441
00:51:27,074 --> 00:51:30,352
Detective, what do you say we reconnect
in the morning?

442
00:51:30,870 --> 00:51:32,389
You got it.

443
00:52:16,183 --> 00:52:17,462
Dead.

444
00:52:17,701 --> 00:52:20,498
That guy was an asshole,
but he was smart.

445
00:52:20,698 --> 00:52:21,737
We could've used him.

446
00:52:22,296 --> 00:52:24,654
Yeah, well, someone had to die.

447
00:52:26,732 --> 00:52:28,810
Would you rather it'd been you?

448
00:53:27,827 --> 00:53:29,385
How'd they get you?

449
00:54:40,550 --> 00:54:41,869
Screw you!

450
00:54:42,508 --> 00:54:45,785
I'm gonna kill you! I'm gonna kill you!

451
00:54:51,979 --> 00:54:54,256
I'm gonna kill...

452
00:55:36,931 --> 00:55:38,969
<i>Hello, Paul.</i>

453
00:55:39,169 --> 00:55:42,205
<i>Did you cut yourself
because you truly wanted to die...</i>

454
00:55:42,405 --> 00:55:46,081
<i>... or did you just want some attention?</i>

455
00:55:46,321 --> 00:55:47,919
<i>Tonight, you'll show me.</i>

456
00:55:48,159 --> 00:55:52,235
<i>If you want to live,
you'll have to cut yourself again.</i>

457
00:55:53,754 --> 00:55:57,670
<i>How much blood will you shed
to stay alive, Paul?</i>

458
00:56:48,216 --> 00:56:51,172
I didn't expect to feel any remorse.

459
00:56:51,772 --> 00:56:53,690
The heart cannot be involved.

460
00:56:53,890 --> 00:56:57,007
Emotionally, there can be nothing there.

461
00:56:57,206 --> 00:56:59,843
It can never be personal.

462
00:57:00,243 --> 00:57:02,601
- Let's go.
- No.

463
00:57:02,801 --> 00:57:04,879
You're not done yet.

464
00:57:05,078 --> 00:57:10,113
Tonight you will see the difference
between killing and rehabilitation.

465
00:57:22,460 --> 00:57:26,136
There is another detective
that you should be aware of.

466
00:57:26,335 --> 00:57:27,934
His name's Tapp.

467
00:57:28,133 --> 00:57:30,531
He's smart, and he's getting closer.

468
00:57:30,731 --> 00:57:32,809
I know who he is.

469
00:57:36,725 --> 00:57:40,081
I need you to lead him
to someone for me.

470
00:57:42,358 --> 00:57:44,276
A doctor.

471
00:57:45,476 --> 00:57:48,552
A healer who needs some healing.

472
00:57:52,348 --> 00:57:54,705
Is this yours, doctor?

473
00:58:02,218 --> 00:58:05,694
You supplied these police files,
didn't you?

474
00:58:37,460 --> 00:58:40,737
You're assuming this is gonna play out
the way you want it.

475
00:58:40,937 --> 00:58:42,975
I assume nothing.

476
00:58:47,690 --> 00:58:53,404
I anticipate the possibilities,
and I let the game play out.

477
00:58:53,923 --> 00:58:56,760
Then why do you need Amanda
in the game?

478
00:58:59,478 --> 00:59:02,594
To ensure that the rules are followed.

479
00:59:03,952 --> 00:59:07,988
She won't make decisions for anyone.
She'll just...

480
00:59:09,267 --> 00:59:11,385
...offer choices.

481
00:59:13,343 --> 00:59:15,461
Little to your left.

482
00:59:23,332 --> 00:59:25,650
That leaves a lot to chance.

483
00:59:40,634 --> 00:59:44,469
If you're good
at anticipating the human mind...

484
00:59:50,064 --> 00:59:52,861
...it leaves nothing to chance.

485
01:00:05,967 --> 01:00:07,565
It's time.

486
01:00:25,386 --> 01:00:27,784
Jesus Christ.

487
01:00:32,579 --> 01:00:35,177
Great. More bombs.

488
01:00:38,933 --> 01:00:41,729
All right. What'd you do to get here?

489
01:00:41,929 --> 01:00:46,484
l... I did something,
and a bunch of people were killed.

490
01:00:46,684 --> 01:00:48,282
I didn't mean to.

491
01:00:49,242 --> 01:00:51,719
They're still dead.

492
01:00:51,918 --> 01:00:53,757
- That's why you're here?
- Yeah.

493
01:00:53,956 --> 01:00:56,914
Shouldn't you have
gone to jail for something like that?

494
01:00:57,113 --> 01:00:59,191
Nobody else knows.

495
01:01:03,707 --> 01:01:05,105
Somebody does.

496
01:01:15,054 --> 01:01:17,532
I didn't kill anybody,
if that's what you're asking.

497
01:01:17,732 --> 01:01:19,010
I wasn't.

498
01:01:20,568 --> 01:01:22,606
I grant building permits.

499
01:01:25,603 --> 01:01:28,720
And yeah, some people might have been
more deserving than others...

500
01:01:28,919 --> 01:01:30,917
...but you know what?
That's the business.

501
01:01:31,117 --> 01:01:33,835
So if someone tells you different,
then they're just stupid.

502
01:01:34,075 --> 01:01:36,552
Or naïve. Or both.

503
01:01:36,751 --> 01:01:37,870
Bullshit.

504
01:01:38,070 --> 01:01:42,026
You take bribes. You're a fucking liar.
You cheat people. That's not nice.

505
01:01:42,226 --> 01:01:43,744
Yeah, well.

506
01:01:43,944 --> 01:01:47,300
I'm sure she's not exactly
Mother Teresa either.

507
01:01:47,500 --> 01:01:49,138
No, I'm not.

508
01:01:50,058 --> 01:01:53,654
I build condos in one of the most
densely populated cities in the country.

509
01:01:53,853 --> 01:01:57,369
You don't put up a new building
without tearing down a few old ones.

510
01:01:57,569 --> 01:02:01,166
So we're all bags of shit that deserve
to be here. That's good. That's great.

511
01:02:01,405 --> 01:02:02,365
Fucking great.

512
01:02:02,604 --> 01:02:04,882
So is that what you think this is?

513
01:02:05,082 --> 01:02:07,120
You don't think there's
any other connection?

514
01:02:07,319 --> 01:02:09,118
No, I do.

515
01:02:09,318 --> 01:02:11,634
I do. And I don't give a shit.

516
01:02:11,834 --> 01:02:14,872
Close the fucking door.
We have to hear the rules.

517
01:02:26,019 --> 01:02:27,458
<i>Hello, and welcome.</i>

518
01:02:27,658 --> 01:02:33,172
<i>You must all be eager to learn the next
important lesson in your transformation.</i>

519
01:02:33,372 --> 01:02:38,086
<i>The game before you is designed
to bridge the gap between you all.</i>

520
01:02:38,286 --> 01:02:41,923
<i>In order to open the five locks
on the door out of this room...</i>

521
01:02:42,122 --> 01:02:45,839
<i>... the five electrical circuits
powering them must be closed.</i>

522
01:02:46,039 --> 01:02:47,517
<i>The only way to do this...</i>

523
01:02:47,717 --> 01:02:52,791
<i>... is to find a way to connect
all five cords to the bath water.</i>

524
01:02:52,991 --> 01:02:56,108
<i>Close the circuits
and the door will open.</i>

525
01:02:56,307 --> 01:02:57,586
<i>But you must work quickly...</i>

526
01:02:57,786 --> 01:03:01,262
<i>... for in three minutes, an electrical
current will surge through this room...</i>

527
01:03:01,502 --> 01:03:04,180
<i>... locking the door forever.</i>

528
01:03:04,380 --> 01:03:08,614
<i>Who will bridge the gap?
The choice is yours.</i>

529
01:03:11,771 --> 01:03:13,369
Jesus Christ.

530
01:03:19,163 --> 01:03:21,681
It's not gonna reach.
How the fuck are we gonna do this?

531
01:03:21,881 --> 01:03:23,359
Come on!

532
01:03:25,397 --> 01:03:27,355
You're gonna get in the tub...

533
01:03:28,034 --> 01:03:30,432
...and we're gonna connect
the five cords to you.

534
01:03:30,632 --> 01:03:32,030
But you're gonna kill me too.

535
01:03:34,228 --> 01:03:35,186
Get in.

536
01:03:35,386 --> 01:03:38,183
Yeah, I'm more of a shower guy.
I don't think I'm gonna do that right now.

537
01:03:38,383 --> 01:03:40,021
Get in the fucking tub.

538
01:03:40,261 --> 01:03:42,739
Fuck you, you bitch.
You get in the fucking tub.

539
01:03:44,297 --> 01:03:45,775
No, don't do it.

540
01:03:45,975 --> 01:03:47,653
Please, no.

541
01:03:58,322 --> 01:04:01,359
You killed her.
You fucking killed her.

542
01:04:01,598 --> 01:04:03,437
I didn't trust her.

543
01:04:03,636 --> 01:04:06,234
Jesus Christ. What is it with you two?

544
01:04:06,434 --> 01:04:08,911
Just shut up and help me with the body.

545
01:04:26,053 --> 01:04:29,609
Hey, hey. No.
Don't let your body touch hers.

546
01:04:57,660 --> 01:04:59,737
Oh, my God, it's a hook.

547
01:05:03,094 --> 01:05:05,731
Stick it in her head or we don't get out.

548
01:05:08,728 --> 01:05:10,686
Just do it.

549
01:05:30,905 --> 01:05:32,383
Come in.

550
01:05:34,021 --> 01:05:36,778
Sir. It's Jill Tuck.

551
01:05:36,978 --> 01:05:38,576
Good evening.

552
01:05:38,776 --> 01:05:39,895
Special Agent Erickson.

553
01:05:40,095 --> 01:05:42,053
Thank you for seeing me
so late in the day.

554
01:05:42,252 --> 01:05:43,372
Not a problem.

555
01:05:43,572 --> 01:05:45,130
That'll be all.

556
01:05:46,648 --> 01:05:49,165
Please, have a seat.

557
01:05:50,444 --> 01:05:53,880
So, what do you need from us?

558
01:05:54,519 --> 01:05:56,717
I think I'm being followed.

559
01:05:56,957 --> 01:05:59,275
Well, that sounds more like
police work, Miss Tuck.

560
01:06:00,993 --> 01:06:03,111
I don't think they can help me.

561
01:06:03,310 --> 01:06:07,186
- Because?
- Because it's you. The FBI.

562
01:06:09,104 --> 01:06:10,582
I don't understand.

563
01:06:10,782 --> 01:06:14,019
It started when John was first identified
as the Jigsaw killer.

564
01:06:14,258 --> 01:06:16,896
It didn't surprise me then,
but I'm still being followed.

565
01:06:17,096 --> 01:06:20,572
By who, Miss Tuck?
Who would be following you?

566
01:06:20,772 --> 01:06:22,770
I think it's the agent
who interrogated me.

567
01:06:23,889 --> 01:06:25,167
Agent Strahm.

568
01:06:26,885 --> 01:06:30,242
- And why would he be following you?
- I don't know.

569
01:06:35,157 --> 01:06:38,394
- Who else have you told about this?
- Only you.

570
01:07:03,886 --> 01:07:05,884
What's going on with Amanda?

571
01:07:06,084 --> 01:07:09,720
Didn't you tell me the only way
to truly offer enlightenment...

572
01:07:10,240 --> 01:07:12,038
...is by detaching emotionally?

573
01:07:15,594 --> 01:07:18,351
But you can have something
Amanda doesn't.

574
01:07:18,951 --> 01:07:20,869
Anonymity.

575
01:07:21,069 --> 01:07:24,745
That's the greatest protection.
That's what I've given you.

576
01:07:25,384 --> 01:07:28,021
I need you to set up a game...

577
01:07:28,980 --> 01:07:32,656
...that may not be entirely clear to you
right now.

578
01:07:33,894 --> 01:07:36,492
But I assure you that
the people being tested...

579
01:07:37,651 --> 01:07:40,448
...are part of something much larger.

580
01:07:40,887 --> 01:07:42,605
They're connected.

581
01:07:42,805 --> 01:07:48,599
So in the end,
all the pieces will fit together...

582
01:07:50,717 --> 01:07:52,755
...and it'll be clear.

583
01:07:56,830 --> 01:08:00,267
- Amanda will fail you.
- We'll see.

584
01:08:01,146 --> 01:08:03,664
What are you doing?

585
01:08:09,937 --> 01:08:13,413
- What's this?
- It's time to play a game.

586
01:08:15,451 --> 01:08:16,809
Help.

587
01:08:17,009 --> 01:08:18,847
Help me. What is this?

588
01:08:19,047 --> 01:08:21,205
What is this? Please.

589
01:08:23,083 --> 01:08:28,517
Why are you keeping me here?
What is this place? What is this place?

590
01:09:01,043 --> 01:09:03,760
We were all supposed to die.

591
01:09:07,715 --> 01:09:10,433
He's just fucking testing you.

592
01:09:10,633 --> 01:09:12,231
Where is my daughter?

593
01:09:15,628 --> 01:09:17,506
Help!

594
01:09:17,945 --> 01:09:19,624
He didn't make it.

595
01:09:20,142 --> 01:09:21,941
Nobody made it.

596
01:09:22,260 --> 01:09:24,338
You were supposed to be the hero.

597
01:10:02,977 --> 01:10:04,935
Peter, where the hell are you?

598
01:10:07,652 --> 01:10:09,211
Hello?

599
01:10:19,120 --> 01:10:22,077
<i>You've reached the voice mail
for Special Agent Peter Strahm.</i>

600
01:10:22,277 --> 01:10:24,035
<i>Leave a message.</i>

601
01:10:26,913 --> 01:10:30,469
Cowan. I wanna put a locator
on Strahm's mobile phone.

602
01:10:31,308 --> 01:10:32,906
Right away, sir.

603
01:10:33,106 --> 01:10:34,624
Call me right back.

604
01:10:34,824 --> 01:10:36,342
Right.

605
01:11:36,998 --> 01:11:40,235
- What the hell is that?
- It's our next nightmare.

606
01:11:46,429 --> 01:11:48,746
There are blades in here.

607
01:11:53,181 --> 01:11:55,139
It's connected to the door.

608
01:11:55,339 --> 01:11:57,536
When the beaker fills up,
the door opens.

609
01:12:00,454 --> 01:12:02,332
Fills with what?

610
01:12:03,330 --> 01:12:06,927
Blood. Our blood.

611
01:12:07,846 --> 01:12:12,841
I think an arm is supposed to go in there
to fill the beaker.

612
01:12:13,399 --> 01:12:16,237
Wait. Why can't we just use
the water from the other room?

613
01:12:16,477 --> 01:12:17,595
No, the slots are closed.

614
01:12:17,835 --> 01:12:20,912
We have to stick our arm in to
keep them open, but they'd get stuck.

615
01:12:21,112 --> 01:12:22,870
We need to close that door.

616
01:12:24,508 --> 01:12:25,986
So, what?

617
01:12:26,586 --> 01:12:31,820
We fight to the death, and one gets to
freedom with the other person's blood?

618
01:12:37,295 --> 01:12:38,453
Hey, wait, wait, wait.

619
01:12:38,653 --> 01:12:40,811
Do you still have the keys
from that first room?

620
01:12:41,011 --> 01:12:43,249
- Yeah.
- Try one of them on that door.

621
01:12:43,448 --> 01:12:46,525
- It won't work.
- No, it might. This one has a keyhole.

622
01:12:51,520 --> 01:12:53,918
It... It's not even the same lock.

623
01:12:57,314 --> 01:12:59,391
Wait, why are there five slots
in this machine?

624
01:13:00,111 --> 01:13:02,109
Shouldn't there only be one?

625
01:13:09,101 --> 01:13:11,059
They all would have worked.

626
01:13:36,233 --> 01:13:37,311
There you are, Strahm.

627
01:13:38,350 --> 01:13:41,267
All right. I got him.

628
01:13:48,940 --> 01:13:51,097
I don't think this is a good idea.

629
01:13:51,297 --> 01:13:53,374
The tub wasn't meant for one person.

630
01:13:53,574 --> 01:13:55,492
We were supposed to hold
one cable each...

631
01:13:55,692 --> 01:13:58,009
...and suffer a small shock.

632
01:13:58,409 --> 01:13:59,767
It was meant for five people.

633
01:13:59,967 --> 01:14:02,205
They all were. Every game.

634
01:14:02,405 --> 01:14:04,883
We only needed one key
in the first room.

635
01:14:05,082 --> 01:14:08,678
They all worked, and any one of them
would have opened every collar.

636
01:14:09,198 --> 01:14:13,074
In the second room, the three tubes were
large enough for more than one person.

637
01:14:13,274 --> 01:14:16,310
We were supposed to work together
so we all survived.

638
01:14:16,510 --> 01:14:18,148
That's the game.

639
01:14:18,348 --> 01:14:20,426
Your instincts will tell you to do
one thing...

640
01:14:20,626 --> 01:14:22,703
...but I implore you to do the opposite.

641
01:14:22,903 --> 01:14:24,381
Oh, God.

642
01:14:24,621 --> 01:14:27,499
Yeah. Big fucking whoops.

643
01:14:43,202 --> 01:14:44,840
<i>Hello, and welcome.</i>

644
01:14:45,040 --> 01:14:46,878
<i>This journey
has been one of discovery...</i>

645
01:14:47,078 --> 01:14:49,155
<i>... and hopefully you've discovered
that the whole...</i>

646
01:14:49,395 --> 01:14:51,353
<i>... is greater than the sum of its parts.</i>

647
01:14:52,073 --> 01:14:56,029
<i>The human body, for instance,
is an astoundingly durable creation.</i>

648
01:14:56,229 --> 01:14:58,985
<i>It contains approximately 10 pints
of blood...</i>

649
01:14:59,185 --> 01:15:03,141
<i>... yet it is still able to operate
with just half of that.</i>

650
01:15:03,340 --> 01:15:06,018
<i>The device before you is
one of sacrifice.</i>

651
01:15:06,258 --> 01:15:07,696
<i>A sacrifice of blood.</i>

652
01:15:07,896 --> 01:15:12,331
<i>In order to open the door, the beaker
must be filled to the marked level...</i>

653
01:15:12,531 --> 01:15:15,887
<i>... a level that is of no coincidence.</i>

654
01:15:16,087 --> 01:15:18,285
<i>This amount can come
from any one of you.</i>

655
01:15:18,525 --> 01:15:22,001
<i>That does not matter.
What does matter is time.</i>

656
01:15:22,201 --> 01:15:24,878
<i>For in 15 minutes,
if the beaker is not filled...</i>

657
01:15:25,078 --> 01:15:29,313
<i>... the bombs will explode
and the doors will be sealed forever.</i>

658
01:15:29,513 --> 01:15:34,348
<i>So now I ask you, how much blood
will you give in order to survive?</i>

659
01:15:40,462 --> 01:15:42,020
Fuck! Fuck.

660
01:15:42,699 --> 01:15:47,973
All right, so one person can fill the
beaker with ten pints of blood and die.

661
01:15:48,213 --> 01:15:50,131
Or two people can fill it...

662
01:15:50,331 --> 01:15:52,329
...with five pints...

663
01:15:52,529 --> 01:15:54,607
...and maybe live.

664
01:15:56,045 --> 01:15:57,284
What are we gonna do?

665
01:16:29,450 --> 01:16:30,648
I lied.

666
01:16:32,207 --> 01:16:35,244
I know the investigative journalist
in there. His name is Charles.

667
01:16:35,443 --> 01:16:38,041
He was writing a story about what I did.

668
01:16:39,319 --> 01:16:41,117
What'd you do?

669
01:16:42,955 --> 01:16:45,113
A dealer gave me...

670
01:16:45,313 --> 01:16:48,630
...an ounce of heroin to burn down
an abandoned building.

671
01:16:48,830 --> 01:16:49,828
But it wa...

672
01:16:50,028 --> 01:16:53,065
Oh, God. It wasn't abandoned.
There was eight people in there.

673
01:16:53,264 --> 01:16:56,622
Eight people died.

674
01:16:56,981 --> 01:17:00,417
And the feds got involved.

675
01:17:00,617 --> 01:17:03,214
And I got caught but I made a deal
and my dad got me off.

676
01:17:03,454 --> 01:17:06,731
The guy who hired me disappeared and
nothing happened. Nothing happened.

677
01:17:33,901 --> 01:17:35,780
That's how she knew me.

678
01:17:36,019 --> 01:17:38,177
The woman in the tub.

679
01:17:38,937 --> 01:17:41,294
The fire. It's what connects us.

680
01:17:42,093 --> 01:17:45,210
The fire inspector who wrote
the bogus accident report...

681
01:17:45,450 --> 01:17:49,366
...the city planner who pushed through
the residential permits...

682
01:17:49,765 --> 01:17:53,282
...the journalist that buried
the investigative story...

683
01:17:53,481 --> 01:17:56,438
...the rich-kid junkie
who was the patsy...

684
01:17:56,638 --> 01:17:59,515
...and the real estate developer
who set it all in motion.

685
01:18:00,195 --> 01:18:04,429
We killed eight people and stole
the property, and nobody cared.

686
01:18:05,269 --> 01:18:06,308
Nobody cared?

687
01:18:06,867 --> 01:18:09,504
Eight people and their families cared.

688
01:18:09,704 --> 01:18:13,340
The feds cared. Look at my fucking arm.
I cared! I cared!

689
01:18:14,060 --> 01:18:15,458
But you didn't face justice.

690
01:18:16,058 --> 01:18:17,096
None of us did.

691
01:18:17,296 --> 01:18:19,494
Why did they all do it?

692
01:18:19,694 --> 01:18:20,772
Why? Was it for money?

693
01:18:21,731 --> 01:18:24,169
This was your plan?
You were the one behind it?

694
01:18:25,048 --> 01:18:27,005
There was eight people
in that building.

695
01:18:27,205 --> 01:18:29,163
You had to know that.
Did you know that?

696
01:18:30,602 --> 01:18:32,041
You're a monster.

697
01:18:36,636 --> 01:18:37,914
So are you.

698
01:18:38,754 --> 01:18:41,630
We both deserve to be here.

699
01:19:34,534 --> 01:19:37,172
I can't do this alone. Look at me.
I can't do this alone.

700
01:19:37,372 --> 01:19:38,410
Okay. It's okay.

701
01:20:03,864 --> 01:20:05,102
We have to go on three.

702
01:20:23,523 --> 01:20:24,522
One.

703
01:20:32,594 --> 01:20:34,471
Two.

704
01:20:38,307 --> 01:20:40,465
Put your hand in the hole!

705
01:20:48,856 --> 01:20:50,454
Three!

706
01:22:19,560 --> 01:22:20,919
<i>Hello, Agent Strahm.</i>

707
01:22:21,439 --> 01:22:23,157
<i>If you are hearing this...</i>

708
01:22:23,357 --> 01:22:26,113
<i>... then you have once again
found what you're looking for.</i>

709
01:22:26,313 --> 01:22:27,672
<i>Or so you think.</i>

710
01:22:27,871 --> 01:22:30,709
<i>Your dedication is to be commended.</i>

711
01:22:30,909 --> 01:22:35,544
<i>But I ask you if you have learned
anything on your journey of discovery.</i>

712
01:22:35,744 --> 01:22:37,582
<i>As the old adage goes:</i>

713
01:22:37,782 --> 01:22:43,256
<i>"Fool me once, shame on you.
Fool me twice, shame on me. "</i>

714
01:22:43,735 --> 01:22:47,891
<i>The situation you find yourself in
is one of trust.</i>

715
01:22:48,090 --> 01:22:52,525
<i>So I ask you, Special Agent Strahm,
have you learned to trust me?</i>

716
01:22:52,725 --> 01:22:57,960
<i>The only way to survive this room
is by entering the glass box before you.</i>

717
01:22:58,200 --> 01:23:03,154
<i>Pain will be incurred,
but you have a chance of survival.</i>

718
01:23:31,205 --> 01:23:32,284
We did it.

719
01:23:32,484 --> 01:23:33,802
We won.

720
01:23:34,002 --> 01:23:35,600
We won.

721
01:25:23,806 --> 01:25:26,324
I got you, you motherfucker.

722
01:25:48,340 --> 01:25:49,619
Drop it!

723
01:25:49,818 --> 01:25:51,776
I said drop it!

724
01:25:58,210 --> 01:25:59,848
Who did this to you?

725
01:26:00,088 --> 01:26:01,327
Who did this to you?

726
01:26:03,923 --> 01:26:04,923
We won.

727
01:26:05,483 --> 01:26:07,161
We won.

728
01:26:07,360 --> 01:26:09,638
We worked together.

729
01:26:20,147 --> 01:26:24,862
I need immediate medical assistance.
1293 Sandburst Drive.

730
01:27:05,060 --> 01:27:07,098
Jesus, Peter.

731
01:27:23,919 --> 01:27:25,637
Tell me how to open it.

732
01:27:26,077 --> 01:27:27,076
How do I open it?

733
01:27:40,062 --> 01:27:43,779
<i>However, if you choose not to,
you will never be heard from again.</i>

734
01:27:44,018 --> 01:27:46,176
<i>Your body will never be found.</i>

735
01:27:46,376 --> 01:27:48,213
<i>You will simply vanish.</i>

736
01:27:49,053 --> 01:27:54,887
<i>I ask you, Special Agent Strahm,
have you learned enough to trust me?</i>

737
01:27:55,087 --> 01:27:56,805
<i>Will you heed my warning?</i>

738
01:27:57,005 --> 01:27:58,882
<i>- For if you do not...
- Fuck you.</i>

739
01:27:59,082 --> 01:28:01,440
<i>... this room will forever be your tomb.</i>

740
01:28:01,640 --> 01:28:04,676
<i>And my legacy will become yours.</i>

741
01:28:05,116 --> 01:28:07,713
If you're good at anticipating
the human mind...

742
01:28:07,953 --> 01:28:10,510
- I think I'm being followed.
- Who would be following you?

743
01:28:10,750 --> 01:28:13,067
I wanna talk to Jill Tuck one last time.

744
01:28:13,267 --> 01:28:15,465
He suspected someone on the inside.

745
01:28:17,863 --> 01:28:20,180
- it leaves nothing to chance.

746
01:28:23,616 --> 01:28:25,215
We were all supposed to die.

747
01:28:26,574 --> 01:28:28,212
You were supposed to be the hero.

748
01:28:31,888 --> 01:28:33,286
<i>Make your choice.</i>

749
01:28:38,161 --> 01:28:39,639
Cowan.

750
01:28:39,879 --> 01:28:41,078
Yeah, this is Erickson.

751
01:28:41,278 --> 01:28:43,635
I want you to put out an APB.

752
01:28:44,075 --> 01:28:46,832
Suspect's name is Peter Strahm.

753
01:28:47,311 --> 01:28:48,950
Yeah, that's right.

754
01:28:49,150 --> 01:28:51,148
Special Agent Peter Strahm.

755
01:29:13,564 --> 01:29:16,001
I'm gonna stop you, you son of a bitch.

756
01:29:19,358 --> 01:29:22,194
I know who you are. I know.

757
