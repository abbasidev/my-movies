1
00:03:50,076 --> 00:03:54,672
<i>I have sailed the world
Beheld its wonders</i>

2
00:03:54,781 --> 00:03:59,309
<i>From the Dardanelles
To the mountains of Peru</i>

3
00:03:59,419 --> 00:04:03,617
<i>But there's no place like London</i>

4
00:04:03,723 --> 00:04:07,750
<i>No, there's no place like London</i>

5
00:04:07,861 --> 00:04:09,260
Mr. Todd?

6
00:04:10,196 --> 00:04:14,758
<i>You are young
Life has been kind to you</i>

7
00:04:18,171 --> 00:04:22,540
<i>You will learn</i>

8
00:04:37,324 --> 00:04:39,383
<i>There's a hole in the world
like a great black pit</i>

9
00:04:39,492 --> 00:04:41,357
<i>And the vermin of the world inhabit it</i>

10
00:04:41,461 --> 00:04:43,486
<i>And its morals aren't worth
what a pig could spit</i>

11
00:04:43,596 --> 00:04:46,087
<i>And it goes by the name of London</i>

12
00:04:47,233 --> 00:04:49,292
<i>At the top of the hole
sit a privileged few</i>

13
00:04:49,402 --> 00:04:51,302
<i>Making mock of the vermin
in the lower zoo</i>

14
00:04:51,404 --> 00:04:53,133
<i>Turning beauty into filth and greed</i>

15
00:04:53,239 --> 00:04:58,541
<i>I too have sailed the world
and seen its wonders</i>

16
00:04:58,645 --> 00:05:03,139
<i>For the cruelty of men
is as wondrous as Peru</i>

17
00:05:03,249 --> 00:05:07,515
<i>But there's no place like London</i>

18
00:05:25,372 --> 00:05:27,840
<i>Is everything all right, Mr. Todd?</i>

19
00:05:29,142 --> 00:05:31,440
<i>I beg your indulgence, Anthony.</i>

20
00:05:32,112 --> 00:05:34,273
My mind is far from easy.

21
00:05:36,249 --> 00:05:41,414
In these once familiar streets
I feel shadows everywhere.

22
00:05:41,688 --> 00:05:43,019
Shadows?

23
00:05:44,557 --> 00:05:45,854
Ghosts.

24
00:05:53,099 --> 00:05:56,660
<i>There was a barber and his wife</i>

25
00:05:56,770 --> 00:05:59,705
<i>And she was beautiful</i>

26
00:06:00,874 --> 00:06:04,241
<i>A foolish barber and his wife</i>

27
00:06:04,344 --> 00:06:07,370
<i>She was his reason and his life</i>

28
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:10,643
<i>And she was beautiful</i>

29
00:06:11,351 --> 00:06:15,219
<i>And she was virtuous</i>

30
00:06:17,257 --> 00:06:19,851
<i>And he was</i>

31
00:06:22,061 --> 00:06:25,588
<i>naive</i>

32
00:06:33,239 --> 00:06:36,731
<i>There was another man who saw</i>

33
00:06:36,843 --> 00:06:39,869
<i>that she was beautiful</i>

34
00:06:40,647 --> 00:06:44,083
<i>A pious vulture of the law</i>

35
00:06:44,184 --> 00:06:47,551
<i>Who, with a gesture of his claw</i>

36
00:06:47,654 --> 00:06:51,181
<i>Removed the barber from his plate</i>

37
00:06:51,291 --> 00:06:55,785
<i>Then there was nothing but to wait</i>

38
00:06:55,895 --> 00:06:58,295
<i>And she would fall</i>

39
00:06:58,398 --> 00:07:04,803
<i>So soft, so young
so lost and, oh, so beautiful</i>

40
00:07:08,675 --> 00:07:11,769
<i>And the lady, sir, did she succumb?</i>

41
00:07:12,779 --> 00:07:16,237
<i>Oh, that was many years ago</i>

42
00:07:19,953 --> 00:07:23,286
<i>I doubt if anyone would know</i>

43
00:07:32,398 --> 00:07:34,161
<i>I'd like to thank you, Anthony.</i>

44
00:07:34,267 --> 00:07:38,294
<i>If you hadn't spotted me,
I'd be lost on the ocean still.</i>

45
00:07:39,506 --> 00:07:41,337
Will I see you again?

46
00:07:42,642 --> 00:07:44,974
You might find me if you like.

47
00:07:46,646 --> 00:07:49,479
<i>Around Fleet Street, I wouldn't wonder.</i>

48
00:07:51,251 --> 00:07:53,344
<i>Until then, my friend.</i>

49
00:08:03,596 --> 00:08:05,655
<i>There's a hole in the world
like a great black pit</i>

50
00:08:05,765 --> 00:08:07,824
<i>And it's filled with people
who are filled with shit</i>

51
00:08:07,934 --> 00:08:10,630
<i>And the vermin of the world inhabit it</i>

52
00:09:04,657 --> 00:09:05,681
A customer!

53
00:09:05,792 --> 00:09:07,555
<i>Wait! What's your rush?
What's your hurry?</i>

54
00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:09,890
<i>You gave me such a fright
I thought you was a ghost!</i>

55
00:09:09,996 --> 00:09:12,624
<i>Half a minute, can't you sit?
Sit you down. Sit!</i>

56
00:09:12,732 --> 00:09:15,223
<i>All I meant is that I haven't seen
a customer for weeks!</i>

57
00:09:15,335 --> 00:09:17,803
<i>Did you come here for a pie, sir?</i>

58
00:09:17,904 --> 00:09:20,134
<i>Do forgive me
if me head's a little vague</i>

59
00:09:20,239 --> 00:09:21,228
What was that?

60
00:09:21,341 --> 00:09:25,038
<i>But you'd think we had the plague!
From the way that people keep avoiding</i>

61
00:09:25,144 --> 00:09:26,133
<i>No, you don't.</i>

62
00:09:26,245 --> 00:09:28,338
<i>Heaven knows I try, sir!</i>

63
00:09:28,448 --> 00:09:31,110
<i>But there's no one
comes in even to inhale</i>

64
00:09:31,217 --> 00:09:33,947
<i>Right you are, sir
would you like a drop of ale?</i>

65
00:09:34,053 --> 00:09:37,216
<i>Mind you, I can hardly blame them</i>

66
00:09:37,323 --> 00:09:41,657
<i>These are probably
the worst pies in London</i>

67
00:09:41,761 --> 00:09:44,252
<i>I know why nobody cares to take them</i>

68
00:09:44,364 --> 00:09:47,595
<i>I should know, I make them
But good? No!</i>

69
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:50,726
<i>The worst pies in London</i>

70
00:09:50,837 --> 00:09:54,705
<i>Even that's polite
The worst pies in London</i>

71
00:09:54,807 --> 00:09:57,298
<i>If you doubt it, take a bite</i>

72
00:09:58,711 --> 00:10:03,478
<i>Is that just disgusting?
You have to concede it</i>

73
00:10:03,583 --> 00:10:05,608
<i>It's nothing but crusting</i>

74
00:10:05,718 --> 00:10:11,315
<i>Here, drink this, you'll need it
The worst pies in London</i>

75
00:10:11,424 --> 00:10:13,949
<i>And no wonder
with the price of meat what it is</i>

76
00:10:14,060 --> 00:10:16,995
<i>When you get it
Never thought I'd live to see the day</i>

77
00:10:17,096 --> 00:10:20,190
<i>Men'd think it was a treat
Finding poor animals</i>

78
00:10:20,299 --> 00:10:21,425
<i>What are dying in the street</i>

79
00:10:21,534 --> 00:10:23,900
<i>Mrs. Mooney has a pie shop</i>

80
00:10:24,003 --> 00:10:26,528
<i>Does her business
but I noticed something weird</i>

81
00:10:26,639 --> 00:10:29,164
<i>Lately all her neighbors' cats
have disappeared</i>

82
00:10:29,275 --> 00:10:32,301
<i>Have to hand it to her
What I calls enterprise</i>

83
00:10:32,412 --> 00:10:34,073
<i>Popping pussies into pies</i>

84
00:10:34,180 --> 00:10:36,341
<i>Wouldn't do in my shop</i>

85
00:10:36,449 --> 00:10:38,974
<i>Just the thought of it's enough
to make you sick</i>

86
00:10:39,085 --> 00:10:42,145
<i>And I'm telling you
them pussycats is quick</i>

87
00:10:42,255 --> 00:10:45,622
<i>No denying times is hard, sir!</i>

88
00:10:45,725 --> 00:10:49,661
<i>Even harder than
the worst pies in London</i>

89
00:10:49,762 --> 00:10:53,425
<i>Only lard and nothing more
Is that just revolting</i>

90
00:10:53,533 --> 00:10:55,501
<i>All greasy and gritty</i>

91
00:10:55,601 --> 00:10:57,796
<i>It looks like it's molting</i>

92
00:10:57,904 --> 00:10:59,895
<i>And tastes like</i>

93
00:11:00,006 --> 00:11:01,405
<i>Well, pity</i>

94
00:11:01,507 --> 00:11:04,704
<i>A woman alone!</i>

95
00:11:05,611 --> 00:11:08,512
<i>With limited wind</i>

96
00:11:08,614 --> 00:11:13,608
<i>And the worst pies in London</i>

97
00:11:14,887 --> 00:11:16,149
<i>Sir</i>

98
00:11:16,789 --> 00:11:18,916
<i>Times is hard</i>

99
00:11:19,025 --> 00:11:24,657
<i>Times is hard</i>

100
00:11:27,133 --> 00:11:31,331
<i>Trust me, dearie, it's gonna take a lot
more than ale to wash that taste out.</i>

101
00:11:32,205 --> 00:11:35,641
<i>Come with me.
We'll get you a nice tumbler of gin, eh?</i>

102
00:11:48,387 --> 00:11:49,376
<i>Isn't this homey, now?</i>

103
00:11:51,057 --> 00:11:53,582
<i>The cheery wallpaper
was a real bargain, too.</i>

104
00:11:53,693 --> 00:11:56,287
It was only partly singed when
the chapel burned down.

105
00:11:56,395 --> 00:11:59,762
<i>There you go.
You sit down, warm your bones.</i>

106
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:03,334
You've a room over the shop here?

107
00:12:03,436 --> 00:12:05,768
<i>Times is so hard,
why don't you rent it out?</i>

108
00:12:05,872 --> 00:12:08,841
<i>What, up there? No, I won't go near it.</i>

109
00:12:11,010 --> 00:12:13,069
People think it's haunted.

110
00:12:14,013 --> 00:12:15,878
- Haunted?
- Yeah.

111
00:12:17,216 --> 00:12:19,514
And who's to say they're wrong?

112
00:12:20,219 --> 00:12:23,985
<i>You see, years ago,
something happened up there.</i>

113
00:12:24,090 --> 00:12:26,115
Something not very nice.

114
00:12:29,195 --> 00:12:31,959
<i>There was a barber and his wife</i>

115
00:12:33,166 --> 00:12:36,693
<i>And he was beautiful</i>

116
00:12:36,803 --> 00:12:40,170
<i>A proper artist with a knife</i>

117
00:12:40,273 --> 00:12:43,538
<i>But they transported him for life</i>

118
00:12:43,643 --> 00:12:47,079
<i>And he was beautiful</i>

119
00:12:48,781 --> 00:12:52,717
<i>Barker, his name was. Benjamin Barker.</i>

120
00:12:53,553 --> 00:12:55,748
What was his crime?

121
00:12:56,088 --> 00:12:57,680
Foolishness.

122
00:12:58,891 --> 00:13:01,519
<i>He had this wife, you see</i>

123
00:13:01,627 --> 00:13:03,788
<i>Pretty little thing, silly little nit</i>

124
00:13:03,896 --> 00:13:08,026
<i>Had her chance
for the moon on a string</i>

125
00:13:08,134 --> 00:13:10,466
<i>Poor thing</i>

126
00:13:11,871 --> 00:13:14,169
<i>Poor thing</i>

127
00:13:15,474 --> 00:13:17,965
<i>There was this judge, you see</i>

128
00:13:18,077 --> 00:13:22,639
<i>Wanted her like mad
Every day he sent her a flower</i>

129
00:13:22,748 --> 00:13:25,444
<i>But did she come down from her tower?</i>

130
00:13:26,219 --> 00:13:28,983
<i>Sat up there and sobbed by the hour</i>

131
00:13:29,522 --> 00:13:31,547
<i>Poor fool</i>

132
00:13:31,791 --> 00:13:35,022
<i>But there was worse yet to come
poor thing</i>

133
00:13:41,767 --> 00:13:46,431
<i>Well, Beadle calls on her all polite
Poor thing</i>

134
00:13:46,873 --> 00:13:48,500
<i>Poor thing</i>

135
00:13:48,608 --> 00:13:51,702
<i>The Judge, he tells her is all contrite</i>

136
00:13:51,811 --> 00:13:55,042
<i>He blames himself
for her dreadful plight</i>

137
00:13:55,147 --> 00:13:58,207
<i>She must come straight
to his house tonight</i>

138
00:13:58,317 --> 00:14:01,013
<i>Poor thing, poor thing</i>

139
00:14:06,192 --> 00:14:09,218
<i>Of course, when she goes there
Poor thing, poor thing</i>

140
00:14:09,328 --> 00:14:12,161
<i>They're having this ball all in masks</i>

141
00:14:12,265 --> 00:14:15,428
<i>There's no one she knows there
Poor dear, poor thing</i>

142
00:14:15,534 --> 00:14:18,503
<i>She wanders tormented and drinks
Poor thing</i>

143
00:14:18,604 --> 00:14:21,539
<i>The Judge has repented, she thinks
Poor thing</i>

144
00:14:21,641 --> 00:14:24,701
<i>"Oh, where is Judge Turpin?"
She asks</i>

145
00:14:26,078 --> 00:14:29,377
<i>He was there all right
Only not so contrite</i>

146
00:14:32,018 --> 00:14:35,283
<i>She wasn't no match for such craft
you see</i>

147
00:14:35,388 --> 00:14:38,084
<i>And everyone thought it so droll</i>

148
00:14:38,190 --> 00:14:41,057
<i>They figured she had to be daft
you see</i>

149
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:44,152
<i>So all of them stood there and laughed
you see</i>

150
00:14:44,263 --> 00:14:45,560
<i>Poor soul</i>

151
00:14:46,999 --> 00:14:48,557
<i>Poor thing...</i>

152
00:14:56,542 --> 00:14:57,839
No!

153
00:15:00,146 --> 00:15:02,842
Would no one have mercy on her?

154
00:15:03,749 --> 00:15:05,683
<i>So, it is you,</i>

155
00:15:06,519 --> 00:15:08,214
Benjamin Barker?

156
00:15:09,855 --> 00:15:11,584
Where is Lucy?

157
00:15:13,125 --> 00:15:14,752
Where is my wife?

158
00:15:15,328 --> 00:15:17,296
She poisoned herself.

159
00:15:17,997 --> 00:15:21,091
<i>Arsenic, from the apothecary
around the corner.</i>

160
00:15:22,301 --> 00:15:25,668
<i>Tried to stop her,
but she wouldn't listen to me.</i>

161
00:15:29,241 --> 00:15:31,368
And he's got your daughter.

162
00:15:33,546 --> 00:15:34,877
He?

163
00:15:36,015 --> 00:15:37,607
Judge Turpin?

164
00:15:38,851 --> 00:15:42,082
Adopted her. Like his own.

165
00:15:44,023 --> 00:15:45,547
Fifteen years.

166
00:15:46,492 --> 00:15:49,859
I've sweated in a living hell
on a false charge.

167
00:15:51,931 --> 00:15:56,459
Fifteen years dreaming I might
come home to a wife and child.

168
00:15:58,137 --> 00:16:01,504
<i>Well, I can't say the years have been
particularly kind to you, Mr. Barker.</i>

169
00:16:01,607 --> 00:16:04,098
No. Not Barker.

170
00:16:05,344 --> 00:16:07,039
That man is dead.

171
00:16:08,147 --> 00:16:11,139
It's Todd now. Sweeney Todd.

172
00:16:12,918 --> 00:16:15,148
And he will have his revenge.

173
00:16:48,187 --> 00:16:49,779
Come in.

174
00:16:50,156 --> 00:16:52,488
<i>Nothing to be afraid of, love.</i>

175
00:17:39,371 --> 00:17:42,397
<i>When they came for the girl, I hid them.</i>

176
00:17:42,508 --> 00:17:45,136
<i>Could've sold them, but I didn't.</i>

177
00:17:56,989 --> 00:18:00,015
<i>Those handles is chased silver,
ain't they?</i>

178
00:18:01,794 --> 00:18:04,058
Silver. Yes.

179
00:18:14,039 --> 00:18:17,167
<i>These are my friends</i>

180
00:18:18,777 --> 00:18:22,873
<i>See how they glisten</i>

181
00:18:23,816 --> 00:18:27,115
<i>See this one shine</i>

182
00:18:27,753 --> 00:18:32,486
<i>How he smiles in the light</i>

183
00:18:32,591 --> 00:18:35,890
<i>My friend</i>

184
00:18:35,995 --> 00:18:40,193
<i>My faithful friend</i>

185
00:18:42,735 --> 00:18:46,603
<i>Speak to me, friend</i>

186
00:18:47,673 --> 00:18:51,200
<i>Whisper, I'll listen</i>

187
00:18:52,178 --> 00:18:55,614
<i>I know, I know</i>

188
00:18:55,714 --> 00:19:02,381
<i>You've been locked
out of sight all these years</i>

189
00:19:03,022 --> 00:19:07,220
<i>Like me, my friend</i>

190
00:19:07,326 --> 00:19:11,422
<i>Well, I've come home</i>

191
00:19:11,530 --> 00:19:15,694
<i>To find you waiting</i>

192
00:19:17,002 --> 00:19:19,470
<i>Home</i>

193
00:19:19,572 --> 00:19:23,565
<i>And we're together</i>

194
00:19:24,410 --> 00:19:28,141
<i>And we'll do wonders</i>

195
00:19:30,282 --> 00:19:32,147
<i>Won't we?</i>

196
00:19:33,319 --> 00:19:36,083
<i>You there, my friend</i>

197
00:19:36,188 --> 00:19:40,090
<i>- I'm your friend, too, Mr. Todd
- Come, let me hold you</i>

198
00:19:40,192 --> 00:19:43,628
<i>- If you only knew, Mr. Todd
- Now, with a sigh</i>

199
00:19:43,729 --> 00:19:44,957
<i>Oh, Mr. Todd</i>

200
00:19:45,064 --> 00:19:48,727
<i>- you're warm in my hand
- You grow warm in my hand</i>

201
00:19:48,834 --> 00:19:50,802
<i>My friend</i>

202
00:19:50,903 --> 00:19:54,634
<i>- You've come home
- My clever friend</i>

203
00:19:54,740 --> 00:19:58,506
<i>Always had a fondness for you, I did</i>

204
00:19:58,611 --> 00:20:01,307
<i>Rest now, my friends</i>

205
00:20:01,413 --> 00:20:05,679
<i>- Never you fear, Mr. Todd
- Soon I'll unfold you</i>

206
00:20:05,784 --> 00:20:08,514
<i>- You can move in here, Mr. Todd
- Soon you'll know</i>

207
00:20:08,621 --> 00:20:11,784
<i>- Splendors you never
- Splendors you never</i>

208
00:20:11,890 --> 00:20:15,053
<i>- have dreamed all your days
- have dreamed all your days</i>

209
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:16,752
<i>Will be yours</i>

210
00:20:16,862 --> 00:20:19,422
<i>My lucky friends</i>

211
00:20:19,531 --> 00:20:23,592
<i>- I'm your friend and now you're mine
- Till now your shine...</i>

212
00:20:23,702 --> 00:20:27,968
<i>- Don't they shine beautiful?
- ... was merely silver</i>

213
00:20:28,073 --> 00:20:30,564
<i>Silver's good enough for me</i>

214
00:20:30,676 --> 00:20:36,546
<i>- Friends, you shall drip rubies
- Mr. T</i>

215
00:20:38,017 --> 00:20:41,544
<i>You'll soon drip precious</i>

216
00:20:43,355 --> 00:20:46,188
<i>rubies</i>

217
00:20:53,899 --> 00:20:55,389
Leave me.

218
00:21:08,847 --> 00:21:13,580
<i>At last, my arm is complete again.</i>

219
00:22:14,947 --> 00:22:19,247
<i>Green finch and linnet bird
Nightingale, blackbird</i>

220
00:22:19,351 --> 00:22:22,548
<i>How is it you sing?</i>

221
00:22:23,589 --> 00:22:27,650
<i>How can you jubilate
Sitting in cages</i>

222
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:30,820
<i>Never taking wing?</i>

223
00:22:31,930 --> 00:22:36,526
<i>Outside the sky waits
Beckoning, beckoning</i>

224
00:22:36,635 --> 00:22:39,365
<i>Just beyond the bars</i>

225
00:22:40,973 --> 00:22:44,136
<i>How can you remain
Staring at the rain</i>

226
00:22:44,243 --> 00:22:48,145
<i>Maddened by the stars?</i>

227
00:22:49,581 --> 00:22:53,779
<i>How is it you sing anything?</i>

228
00:22:54,486 --> 00:22:58,479
<i>How is it you sing?</i>

229
00:23:12,471 --> 00:23:16,532
<i>My cage has many rooms
Damask and dark</i>

230
00:23:16,642 --> 00:23:22,103
<i>Nothing there sings
Not even my lark</i>

231
00:23:22,214 --> 00:23:26,617
<i>Larks never will, you know
When they're captive</i>

232
00:23:26,718 --> 00:23:31,985
<i>Teach me to be more adaptive</i>

233
00:23:37,162 --> 00:23:41,622
<i>Green finch and linnet bird
Nightingale, blackbird</i>

234
00:23:41,733 --> 00:23:45,829
<i>Teach me how to sing</i>

235
00:23:45,938 --> 00:23:50,875
<i>If I cannot fly</i>

236
00:23:52,144 --> 00:23:58,777
<i>Let me sing</i>

237
00:24:10,195 --> 00:24:11,685
<i>Alms!</i>

238
00:24:11,830 --> 00:24:16,597
<i>Alms for a miserable woman</i>

239
00:24:18,437 --> 00:24:24,433
<i>On a miserable chilly morning</i>

240
00:24:26,578 --> 00:24:28,808
<i>- Thank you, sir!
- Ma'am?</i>

241
00:24:30,182 --> 00:24:32,946
Could you tell me whose house this is?

242
00:24:33,352 --> 00:24:36,344
<i>That's the great
Judge Turpin's house, that is.</i>

243
00:24:36,455 --> 00:24:38,821
And the young lady who resides there?

244
00:24:38,924 --> 00:24:42,917
<i>Oh, that's Johanna,
his pretty little ward.</i>

245
00:24:43,128 --> 00:24:46,461
<i>Keeps her snug, he does. All locked up.</i>

246
00:24:47,165 --> 00:24:51,898
<i>So don't you go trespassing there,
or it's a good whipping for you,</i>

247
00:24:52,004 --> 00:24:55,838
or any other young man
with mischief on his mind.

248
00:24:56,742 --> 00:24:58,209
<i>Alms!</i>

249
00:24:58,310 --> 00:25:03,373
<i>Alms for a desperate woman</i>

250
00:25:08,220 --> 00:25:12,316
<i>I feel you</i>

251
00:25:12,424 --> 00:25:16,360
<i>Johanna</i>

252
00:25:16,461 --> 00:25:20,795
<i>I feel you</i>

253
00:25:20,899 --> 00:25:24,801
<i>I was half convinced I'd waken</i>

254
00:25:24,903 --> 00:25:28,862
<i>Satisfied enough to dream you</i>

255
00:25:28,974 --> 00:25:35,072
<i>Happily I was mistaken, Johanna</i>

256
00:25:36,315 --> 00:25:40,308
<i>I'll steal you</i>

257
00:25:40,419 --> 00:25:44,219
<i>Johanna!</i>

258
00:25:44,323 --> 00:25:48,885
<i>I'll steal you</i>

259
00:26:03,475 --> 00:26:05,602
<i>Come in, lad. Come in.</i>

260
00:26:12,584 --> 00:26:15,018
<i>You were looking for Hyde Park,
you say?</i>

261
00:26:15,153 --> 00:26:16,415
Yes.

262
00:26:16,989 --> 00:26:20,481
<i>It's very large on the map,
but I keep getting lost.</i>

263
00:26:20,592 --> 00:26:22,651
<i>Sit down, lad, sit down.</i>

264
00:26:23,395 --> 00:26:28,059
<i>It's embarrassing for a sailor
to lose his bearings, but there you are.</i>

265
00:26:32,738 --> 00:26:34,205
A sailor?

266
00:26:35,674 --> 00:26:38,404
<i>Yes, sir. The Bountiful, out of Plymouth.</i>

267
00:26:38,543 --> 00:26:42,138
<i>A sailor must know
the ways of the world, yes?</i>

268
00:26:43,115 --> 00:26:46,573
Must be practiced
in the ways of the world.

269
00:26:46,685 --> 00:26:48,710
<i>Would you say you were practiced, boy?</i>

270
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:52,185
<i>- Sir?
- Oh, yes.</i>

271
00:26:53,392 --> 00:26:56,725
Such practices.

272
00:26:58,397 --> 00:27:02,663
The geishas of Japan.
The concubines of Siam.

273
00:27:02,768 --> 00:27:07,228
The catamites of Greece.
The harlots of India.

274
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:12,537
I have them all here. Drawings of them.

275
00:27:12,644 --> 00:27:18,173
Everything you've ever dreamed
of doing with a woman.

276
00:27:19,618 --> 00:27:21,483
Would you like to see?

277
00:27:22,587 --> 00:27:25,055
I think there's been some mistake.

278
00:27:25,924 --> 00:27:27,414
I think not.

279
00:27:29,661 --> 00:27:34,564
<i>You gandered at my ward, Johanna.
You gandered at her.</i>

280
00:27:34,666 --> 00:27:39,035
<i>- Yes, sir, you gandered.
- I meant no harm.</i>

281
00:27:39,137 --> 00:27:41,230
Your meaning is immaterial.

282
00:27:42,741 --> 00:27:44,208
Mark me.

283
00:27:44,309 --> 00:27:51,181
<i>If I see your face again on this street,
you'll rue the day you were born.</i>

284
00:27:55,353 --> 00:27:57,821
<i>Hyde Park is that way, young sir!</i>

285
00:27:57,923 --> 00:28:01,086
<i>A left and a right and straight on,
you see?</i>

286
00:28:01,193 --> 00:28:03,161
<i>Move on, now!</i>

287
00:28:11,570 --> 00:28:15,199
<i>You heard what Judge Turpin said,
little man.</i>

288
00:28:15,941 --> 00:28:20,901
<i>Next time, it'll be your pretty little brains
all over the pavement.</i>

289
00:28:45,237 --> 00:28:49,071
<i>I'll steal you</i>

290
00:28:49,174 --> 00:28:53,133
<i>Johanna</i>

291
00:28:53,245 --> 00:28:57,511
<i>I'll steal you</i>

292
00:28:57,616 --> 00:29:01,450
<i>Do they think that walls can hide you?</i>

293
00:29:01,553 --> 00:29:05,421
<i>Even now, I'm at your window</i>

294
00:29:05,524 --> 00:29:10,052
<i>I am in the dark beside you</i>

295
00:29:10,162 --> 00:29:15,190
<i>Buried sweetly in your yellow hair</i>

296
00:29:22,073 --> 00:29:25,600
<i>I feel you</i>

297
00:29:25,710 --> 00:29:29,544
<i>Johanna</i>

298
00:29:29,648 --> 00:29:33,516
<i>And one day</i>

299
00:29:33,618 --> 00:29:38,453
<i>I'll steal you</i>

300
00:29:38,557 --> 00:29:42,357
<i>Till I'm with you then
I'm with you there!</i>

301
00:29:42,460 --> 00:29:47,329
<i>Sweetly buried in your yellow hair!</i>

302
00:30:09,855 --> 00:30:13,382
He's here every Thursday.
Italian. All the rage he is.

303
00:30:14,259 --> 00:30:16,591
<i>Best barber in London, they say.</i>

304
00:30:48,059 --> 00:30:49,253
Hang on.

305
00:31:21,259 --> 00:31:25,389
<i>Ladies and gentlemen
May I have your attention, please?</i>

306
00:31:26,765 --> 00:31:28,733
<i>Do you wake every morning
in shame and despair</i>

307
00:31:28,833 --> 00:31:31,734
<i>To discover your pillow
is covered with hair</i>

308
00:31:31,836 --> 00:31:33,804
<i>What ought not to be there?</i>

309
00:31:33,905 --> 00:31:37,773
<i>Well, ladies and gentlemen
From now on you can waken at ease</i>

310
00:31:37,876 --> 00:31:39,741
<i>You need never again
have a worry or care</i>

311
00:31:39,844 --> 00:31:42,574
<i>I will show you a miracle
marvelous rare</i>

312
00:31:43,581 --> 00:31:45,378
<i>Gentlemen, you are about
to see something</i>

313
00:31:45,483 --> 00:31:48,384
<i>What rose from the dead!</i>

314
00:31:49,254 --> 00:31:51,279
<i>On the top of my head!</i>

315
00:31:53,792 --> 00:31:57,250
<i>'Twas Pirelli's Miracle Elixir</i>

316
00:31:57,362 --> 00:32:00,798
<i>That's what did the trick, sir
True, sir, true</i>

317
00:32:00,899 --> 00:32:04,426
<i>Was it quick, sir? Did it in a tick, sir?</i>

318
00:32:04,536 --> 00:32:08,131
<i>Just like an elixir ought to do</i>

319
00:32:08,239 --> 00:32:12,608
<i>How about a bottle, mister?
Only costs a penny, guaranteed</i>

320
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:18,841
<i>Does Pirelli's stimulate the growth, sir?</i>

321
00:32:18,950 --> 00:32:22,283
<i>You can have my oath, sir
'Tis unique</i>

322
00:32:22,387 --> 00:32:25,845
<i>Rub a minute
Stimulating, isn't it?</i>

323
00:32:25,957 --> 00:32:29,688
<i>Soon you'll have to thin it
Once a week!</i>

324
00:32:29,794 --> 00:32:31,455
<i>Pardon me, ma'am
what's that awful stench?</i>

325
00:32:31,563 --> 00:32:33,190
<i>Are we standing in an open trench?</i>

326
00:32:33,298 --> 00:32:34,265
<i>Must be standing near an open trench!</i>

327
00:32:34,366 --> 00:32:35,355
<i>Pardon me, sir
what's that awful stench?</i>

328
00:32:35,467 --> 00:32:38,368
<i>Buy Pirelli's Miracle Elixir</i>

329
00:32:38,470 --> 00:32:42,031
<i>Anything what's slick, sir
Soon sprouts curls</i>

330
00:32:42,140 --> 00:32:45,541
<i>Try Pirelli's
When they see how thick, sir</i>

331
00:32:45,643 --> 00:32:49,238
<i>You can have your pick, sir
Of the girls</i>

332
00:32:49,347 --> 00:32:50,507
<i>Want to buy a bottle, missus?</i>

333
00:32:50,615 --> 00:32:52,139
<i>- What is this?
- What is this?</i>

334
00:32:52,250 --> 00:32:54,775
<i>- Smells like piss
- Smells like...</i>

335
00:32:54,886 --> 00:32:56,683
<i>- Looks like piss!
- Wouldn't touch it if I was you, dear!</i>

336
00:32:56,788 --> 00:33:00,224
<i>- This is piss, piss with ink
- Let Pirelli's activate your roots, sir!</i>

337
00:33:00,325 --> 00:33:01,849
<i>Keep it off your boots, sir
Eats right through</i>

338
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:04,793
<i>Yes, get Pirelli's, use a bottle of it
Ladies seem to love it</i>

339
00:33:04,896 --> 00:33:06,796
<i>Flies do, too</i>

340
00:33:09,634 --> 00:33:11,499
<i>I am Adolfo Pirelli</i>

341
00:33:11,603 --> 00:33:13,662
<i>The king of the barbers
The barber of kings</i>

342
00:33:13,772 --> 00:33:17,037
<i>E buon giorno, good day!
I blow you a kiss!</i>

343
00:33:17,642 --> 00:33:19,473
<i>And I</i>

344
00:33:19,577 --> 00:33:21,772
<i>the so famous Pirelli
I wish-a to know-a</i>

345
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:24,747
<i>Who has-a the nerve-a to say</i>

346
00:33:24,849 --> 00:33:27,010
<i>My elixir is piss</i>

347
00:33:27,986 --> 00:33:30,181
<i>Who says this?</i>

348
00:33:32,724 --> 00:33:33,952
I do.

349
00:33:36,061 --> 00:33:38,825
I am Mr. Sweeney Todd of Fleet Street.

350
00:33:40,031 --> 00:33:42,397
I have opened a bottle of Pirelli's Elixir.

351
00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:46,459
<i>And I say to you that it is nothing
but an arrant fraud,</i>

352
00:33:47,405 --> 00:33:50,203
concocted from piss and ink.

353
00:33:51,242 --> 00:33:55,008
<i>Furthermore, Signor,
I have serviced no kings,</i>

354
00:33:56,214 --> 00:34:00,981
<i>yet I wager that I can shave a cheek
with 10 times more dexterity,</i>

355
00:34:01,086 --> 00:34:03,421
than any street mountebank.

356
00:34:08,359 --> 00:34:10,327
Do you see these razors?

357
00:34:11,229 --> 00:34:13,789
I lay them against £5.

358
00:34:14,632 --> 00:34:16,623
<i>You are no match, sir.</i>

359
00:34:17,335 --> 00:34:22,034
<i>Either accept my challenge,
or reveal yourself as a sham.</i>

360
00:34:24,075 --> 00:34:26,168
You hear this foolish man?

361
00:34:26,845 --> 00:34:32,181
<i>Now, please, you will see
how he will-a regret-a his-a folly.</i>

362
00:34:33,184 --> 00:34:34,651
Toby!

363
00:34:34,752 --> 00:34:36,686
Who's for a free shave?

364
00:34:59,511 --> 00:35:01,638
Will Beadle Bamford be the judge?

365
00:35:01,779 --> 00:35:06,443
<i>Glad, as always,
to oblige my friends and neighbors.</i>

366
00:35:17,929 --> 00:35:19,123
Ready?

367
00:35:19,797 --> 00:35:21,025
Ready!

368
00:35:21,633 --> 00:35:22,895
Ready.

369
00:35:23,535 --> 00:35:27,995
<i>The fastest,
smoothest shave is the winner!</i>

370
00:35:52,730 --> 00:35:55,426
<i>Now, signorini, signori
We mix-a the lather</i>

371
00:35:55,533 --> 00:35:58,434
<i>But first-a
You gather around, signorini, signori</i>

372
00:35:58,536 --> 00:36:01,562
<i>You looking a man who have
had-a the glory to shave-a the Pope!</i>

373
00:36:01,673 --> 00:36:03,868
<i>Mr. Sweeney, whoever
I beg-a you pardon</i>

374
00:36:03,975 --> 00:36:06,375
<i>You'll probably say
it was only a cardinal</i>

375
00:36:06,477 --> 00:36:07,842
<i>Nope!</i>

376
00:36:07,946 --> 00:36:09,777
<i>It was-a the Pope!</i>

377
00:36:12,150 --> 00:36:16,985
<i>To shave-a the face
To cut-a the hair</i>

378
00:36:17,088 --> 00:36:22,116
<i>Require the grace
Require the flair</i>

379
00:36:22,227 --> 00:36:24,718
<i>For if-a you slip
You nick the skin</i>

380
00:36:24,829 --> 00:36:27,423
<i>You clip-a the chin
You rip-a the lip a bit</i>

381
00:36:27,532 --> 00:36:29,830
<i>Beyond-a repair</i>

382
00:36:30,435 --> 00:36:32,562
<i>To shave-a the face</i>

383
00:36:33,371 --> 00:36:37,137
<i>Or even a part
Without it-a smart</i>

384
00:36:37,875 --> 00:36:40,742
<i>Require the heart</i>

385
00:36:40,845 --> 00:36:43,336
<i>Not just-a the flash</i>

386
00:36:43,448 --> 00:36:48,977
<i>It take-a panache
It take-a the passion for the art</i>

387
00:36:50,888 --> 00:36:55,348
<i>To shave-a the face
To trim-a the beard</i>

388
00:36:55,994 --> 00:37:00,226
<i>To make-a the bristle
Clean like a whistle</i>

389
00:37:00,331 --> 00:37:06,270
<i>This is from early infancy
The talent give to me</i>

390
00:37:06,537 --> 00:37:09,563
<i>By God</i>

391
00:37:12,777 --> 00:37:16,770
<i>It take-a the skill
It take-a the brains</i>

392
00:37:17,282 --> 00:37:22,948
<i>It take-a da will
To take-a the pains</i>

393
00:37:23,721 --> 00:37:28,886
<i>It take-a the pace
It take-a the grace</i>

394
00:37:38,036 --> 00:37:40,834
The winner is Todd!

395
00:37:52,350 --> 00:37:56,252
<i>Sir, I bow to a skill
far greater than my own.</i>

396
00:37:57,622 --> 00:37:59,180
The £5.

397
00:38:05,663 --> 00:38:08,131
May the good Lord smile on you.

398
00:38:09,634 --> 00:38:11,499
Until we meet again.

399
00:38:12,270 --> 00:38:14,170
<i>Come, boy. Come!</i>

400
00:38:23,681 --> 00:38:25,308
<i>Suppose it's just me gentle heart,</i>

401
00:38:25,416 --> 00:38:28,510
but I do hate to see a boy
treated like that.

402
00:38:28,619 --> 00:38:31,087
<i>Congratulations, Mr. Todd.</i>

403
00:38:31,189 --> 00:38:34,022
<i>May I ask you, sir,
do you have your own establishment?</i>

404
00:38:34,125 --> 00:38:35,683
He certainly does.

405
00:38:35,793 --> 00:38:38,125
<i>Sweeney Todd's Tonsorial Parlor,</i>

406
00:38:38,229 --> 00:38:41,289
above my Meat Pie Emporium
in Fleet Street.

407
00:38:44,969 --> 00:38:47,028
<i>I thank you, sir.</i>

408
00:38:47,138 --> 00:38:49,902
You are a paragon of integrity.

409
00:38:50,007 --> 00:38:54,171
<i>Well, I try to do my best for
my friends and neighbors.</i>

410
00:38:55,012 --> 00:38:58,413
<i>Your establishment
is in Fleet Street, you say?</i>

411
00:38:58,683 --> 00:39:01,117
<i>- Yes, sir.
- Then, Mr. Todd,</i>

412
00:39:01,619 --> 00:39:05,680
you shall surely see me there
before the week is out.

413
00:39:05,990 --> 00:39:08,481
<i>You will be welcome, Beadle Bamford.</i>

414
00:39:08,593 --> 00:39:12,825
<i>And I can guarantee to give you,
without a penny's charge,</i>

415
00:39:12,930 --> 00:39:15,558
the closest shave you will ever know.

416
00:39:26,177 --> 00:39:27,804
<i>Come on, love.</i>

417
00:40:47,458 --> 00:40:49,756
<i>It's not much of a chair, but it'll do.</i>

418
00:40:49,861 --> 00:40:53,024
<i>It was me poor Albert's chair.
Sit in it all day long he did,</i>

419
00:40:53,130 --> 00:40:55,394
after his leg gave out with the gout.

420
00:40:55,500 --> 00:40:57,434
Why doesn't the Beadle come?

421
00:40:57,535 --> 00:41:00,732
<i>"Before the week is out,"
that's what he said.</i>

422
00:41:00,838 --> 00:41:04,137
<i>Well, who says the week's out?
It's only Tuesday.</i>

423
00:41:08,246 --> 00:41:12,910
<i>Easy now
Hush, love, hush</i>

424
00:41:13,017 --> 00:41:17,317
<i>Don't distress yourself
What's your rush?</i>

425
00:41:17,421 --> 00:41:21,653
<i>Keep your thoughts
Nice and lush</i>

426
00:41:21,759 --> 00:41:23,351
<i>Wait</i>

427
00:41:26,230 --> 00:41:30,496
<i>Hush, love, hush
Think it through</i>

428
00:41:30,601 --> 00:41:34,628
<i>Once it bubbles
Then what's to do?</i>

429
00:41:34,739 --> 00:41:38,937
<i>Watch it close
Let it brew</i>

430
00:41:39,043 --> 00:41:40,305
<i>Wait</i>

431
00:41:42,146 --> 00:41:46,845
<i>I've been thinking flowers
Maybe daisies</i>

432
00:41:46,951 --> 00:41:49,010
<i>To brighten up the room</i>

433
00:41:50,388 --> 00:41:55,189
<i>Don't you think some flowers
Pretty daisies</i>

434
00:41:55,293 --> 00:41:57,818
<i>Might relieve the gloom?</i>

435
00:41:59,630 --> 00:42:00,927
<i>Wait</i>

436
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:05,234
<i>Love, wait</i>

437
00:42:05,336 --> 00:42:08,100
And the Judge? When'll we get to him?

438
00:42:09,240 --> 00:42:12,705
Can't you think of nothing else?
Always brooding away on your wrongs

439
00:42:12,810 --> 00:42:15,745
and what happened
heaven knows how many years ago.

440
00:42:15,846 --> 00:42:17,336
Come on.

441
00:42:17,448 --> 00:42:21,179
<i>Slow, love, slow
Time's so fast</i>

442
00:42:21,786 --> 00:42:26,052
<i>Now goes quickly
See, now it's past</i>

443
00:42:26,157 --> 00:42:30,116
<i>Soon will come
Soon will last</i>

444
00:42:30,227 --> 00:42:31,592
<i>Wait</i>

445
00:42:34,665 --> 00:42:38,761
<i>Don't you know
Silly man</i>

446
00:42:38,869 --> 00:42:42,396
<i>Half the fun is to plan the plan?</i>

447
00:42:43,107 --> 00:42:47,168
<i>All good things
come to those who can</i>

448
00:42:47,278 --> 00:42:48,506
<i>Wait</i>

449
00:42:51,716 --> 00:42:56,380
<i>Gillyflowers, maybe
'Stead of daisies</i>

450
00:42:56,587 --> 00:43:01,047
<i>I don't know, though
What do you think?</i>

451
00:43:10,968 --> 00:43:12,629
<i>Oh, I'm sorry, excuse me.</i>

452
00:43:12,737 --> 00:43:15,399
<i>- Mrs. Lovett, sir.
- A pleasure, ma'am.</i>

453
00:43:16,273 --> 00:43:18,332
<i>Mr. Todd,
there's a girl who needs my help.</i>

454
00:43:18,442 --> 00:43:20,467
<i>Such a sad girl and lonely,
but beautiful, too and...</i>

455
00:43:20,578 --> 00:43:24,139
<i>- Slow down, son.
- Yes. I'm sorry.</i>

456
00:43:25,583 --> 00:43:27,517
<i>This girl has a guardian
who keeps her locked away,</i>

457
00:43:27,618 --> 00:43:29,677
<i>but then, this morning,
she dropped this.</i>

458
00:43:29,787 --> 00:43:32,051
Surely a sign
that Johanna wants me to help her.

459
00:43:32,156 --> 00:43:33,714
<i>That's her name, Johanna.</i>

460
00:43:33,824 --> 00:43:37,055
And Turpin is her guardian.
He's a judge of some sort.

461
00:43:37,161 --> 00:43:39,095
<i>Once he goes to court,
I'm going to slip into the house,</i>

462
00:43:39,196 --> 00:43:41,562
release her and beg her
to come away with me tonight.

463
00:43:41,666 --> 00:43:44,066
<i>- Oh, this is very romantic.
- Yes.</i>

464
00:43:45,102 --> 00:43:47,161
<i>But I don't know anyone in London,
you see.</i>

465
00:43:47,271 --> 00:43:51,264
And I need somewhere safe to bring her
till I've hired a coach to take us away.

466
00:43:51,375 --> 00:43:53,400
<i>If I could keep her here
just for an hour or two,</i>

467
00:43:53,511 --> 00:43:55,741
I'd be forever in your debt.

468
00:43:59,517 --> 00:44:02,953
<i>- Bring her here, love.
- Thank you, ma'am.</i>

469
00:44:03,921 --> 00:44:05,286
Mr. Todd?

470
00:44:07,191 --> 00:44:09,386
<i>Oh, thank you.
Thank you, thank you, my friend.</i>

471
00:44:09,493 --> 00:44:11,188
<i>Thank you, ma'am.</i>

472
00:44:14,298 --> 00:44:17,790
<i>Seems like the Fates
are favoring you at last, Mr. T.</i>

473
00:44:19,236 --> 00:44:22,728
What is it? You'll have her back
before the day is out.

474
00:44:23,507 --> 00:44:24,804
What about him?

475
00:44:25,776 --> 00:44:26,936
Him?

476
00:44:27,044 --> 00:44:29,638
<i>Oh, well. Let him bring her here.</i>

477
00:44:29,747 --> 00:44:32,648
<i>And then, since you're so hot for a little,</i>

478
00:44:33,884 --> 00:44:36,409
<i>that's the throat to slit, my dear.</i>

479
00:44:38,189 --> 00:44:39,952
Poor little Johanna.

480
00:44:40,057 --> 00:44:43,493
All those years without a scrap
of motherly affection.

481
00:44:43,994 --> 00:44:47,088
<i>Well, I'll soon see to that.</i>

482
00:44:55,306 --> 00:44:58,605
Hello. What's he doing here?

483
00:45:00,611 --> 00:45:02,875
Keep the boy downstairs.

484
00:45:14,191 --> 00:45:16,625
<i>Signora, is Mr. Todd at home?</i>

485
00:45:16,727 --> 00:45:18,854
Plying his trade upstairs.

486
00:45:19,930 --> 00:45:21,591
Would you look at it now?

487
00:45:21,699 --> 00:45:24,190
<i>You wouldn't mind if I gave it a nice
juicy meat pie, would you?</i>

488
00:45:24,301 --> 00:45:28,101
<i>- Sì, sì, sì. Whatever you want.
- Come on, lad.</i>

489
00:45:28,572 --> 00:45:30,972
<i>Your teeth are strong, I hope.</i>

490
00:45:32,510 --> 00:45:36,071
Close the door.
Get you a nice lovely pie.

491
00:45:38,916 --> 00:45:41,248
Sit down. Make yourself comfy.

492
00:45:48,726 --> 00:45:50,159
Come in.

493
00:45:59,036 --> 00:46:01,732
- Mr. Todd.
- Signor Pirelli.

494
00:46:03,340 --> 00:46:04,830
Call me Davey.

495
00:46:05,876 --> 00:46:09,243
Davey Collin's the name
when it's not professional.

496
00:46:10,481 --> 00:46:12,915
<i>I'd like me five quid back,
if you don't mind.</i>

497
00:46:13,017 --> 00:46:14,109
Why?

498
00:46:14,218 --> 00:46:18,245
<i>Because you entered into our little
wager under false pretenses, my friend.</i>

499
00:46:18,355 --> 00:46:22,985
<i>So that you might remember
to be a bit more forthright in the future,</i>

500
00:46:23,093 --> 00:46:25,027
I'll be taking half your profits
from herewith.

501
00:46:25,129 --> 00:46:27,063
Share and share alike.

502
00:46:28,599 --> 00:46:30,999
Mr. Benjamin Barker.

503
00:46:33,537 --> 00:46:36,597
Here we are. Tuck in.

504
00:46:40,211 --> 00:46:43,146
I like to see a man
with a healthy appetite.

505
00:46:43,247 --> 00:46:45,545
Reminds me of my dear Albert.

506
00:46:46,150 --> 00:46:49,745
<i>Liked to gorge himself
to bloatation, he did.</i>

507
00:46:49,854 --> 00:46:52,152
<i>He didn't have
your nice head of hair, though.</i>

508
00:46:52,256 --> 00:46:55,487
<i>To tell the truth, it gets awful hot.</i>

509
00:46:59,663 --> 00:47:01,824
<i>Yes, this'll do nicely.</i>

510
00:47:05,469 --> 00:47:08,802
<i>You don't remember me, do you?
Why should you?</i>

511
00:47:08,906 --> 00:47:11,238
<i>I was just a little nip
that you hired for a couple of weeks,</i>

512
00:47:11,342 --> 00:47:13,310
sweeping up hair.

513
00:47:14,245 --> 00:47:16,304
But I remember these.

514
00:47:17,147 --> 00:47:20,173
<i>And how could
I ever forget you, Mr. Barker.</i>

515
00:47:24,488 --> 00:47:26,649
I used to sit right here.

516
00:47:27,591 --> 00:47:30,458
Dream of the day
when I could be a proper barber myself.

517
00:47:30,561 --> 00:47:34,292
You might say that you was
inspiration to me.

518
00:47:46,644 --> 00:47:48,509
<i>So, is we got a deal?</i>

519
00:47:49,914 --> 00:47:53,941
<i>Or should I run down the street
to me old pal, Beadle Bamford?</i>

520
00:47:57,554 --> 00:48:01,752
<i>What do you say to that, now,
Mr. Sweeney Todd?</i>

521
00:48:24,415 --> 00:48:27,441
<i>My, my, my. Always work to be done.</i>

522
00:48:27,551 --> 00:48:29,883
<i>Spic and span, that's my motto.</i>

523
00:48:42,566 --> 00:48:45,933
<i>So, how'd you end up
with that dreadful Italian?</i>

524
00:48:46,036 --> 00:48:50,405
Got me from the workhouse.
Been there since I was born.

525
00:48:50,507 --> 00:48:53,101
<i>Oh, God!
He's got an appointment with his tailor!</i>

526
00:48:53,210 --> 00:48:54,802
<i>If he's late, he'll blame me!</i>

527
00:48:54,912 --> 00:48:56,174
Wait!

528
00:49:02,820 --> 00:49:05,345
Signor! You got an appointment!

529
00:49:10,594 --> 00:49:14,394
Signor Pirelli's been called away.
Better run after him.

530
00:49:15,366 --> 00:49:19,803
<i>No, sir. I should stay here,
or it'll be a lashing.</i>

531
00:49:19,903 --> 00:49:22,599
He's a great one for the lashings.

532
00:49:28,479 --> 00:49:29,639
<i>So,</i>

533
00:49:30,948 --> 00:49:34,884
<i>- Mrs. Lovett gave you a pie, did she?
- She's a real lady.</i>

534
00:49:35,753 --> 00:49:37,380
That she is.

535
00:49:42,259 --> 00:49:47,253
<i>But if I know a growing boy,
there's still room for more pie, eh?</i>

536
00:49:47,364 --> 00:49:48,661
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

537
00:49:49,933 --> 00:49:52,731
Then why don't you wait
for your master downstairs?

538
00:49:52,836 --> 00:49:57,205
<i>- Be another pie in it for you, I'm sure.
- No, I should stay here.</i>

539
00:49:59,943 --> 00:50:03,879
<i>Tell you what,
why don't you tell Mrs. Lovett</i>

540
00:50:03,981 --> 00:50:07,439
that I said to give you
a nice big tot of gin.

541
00:50:07,551 --> 00:50:09,109
<i>Thank you, sir!</i>

542
00:51:17,121 --> 00:51:19,419
<i>This is the second time, sir,</i>

543
00:51:19,523 --> 00:51:22,651
you have been brought
before this bench.

544
00:51:23,894 --> 00:51:27,990
<i>Though it is my earnest wish ever
to temper justice with mercy,</i>

545
00:51:28,098 --> 00:51:31,261
your persistent dedication
to a life of crime

546
00:51:31,368 --> 00:51:35,031
is an abomination before God and man.

547
00:51:35,139 --> 00:51:38,597
I therefore sentence you
to hang by the neck until you're dead.

548
00:51:38,709 --> 00:51:41,678
And may the Lord
have mercy on your soul.

549
00:51:42,746 --> 00:51:44,509
Court is adjourned.

550
00:51:53,490 --> 00:51:55,981
<i>Thank you, Your Honor.</i>

551
00:51:56,093 --> 00:51:59,529
- Just the sentence we wanted.
- Was he guilty?

552
00:51:59,630 --> 00:52:00,756
<i>Well, if he didn't do it,</i>

553
00:52:00,864 --> 00:52:03,298
he's surely done
something to warrant a hanging.

554
00:52:03,400 --> 00:52:06,096
- What man has not?
- Sorry?

555
00:52:09,106 --> 00:52:10,869
No matter. Come.

556
00:52:12,075 --> 00:52:13,736
Walk home with me.

557
00:52:16,780 --> 00:52:19,476
<i>I have news for you, my friend.</i>

558
00:52:19,583 --> 00:52:22,609
<i>In order to shield her
from the evils of this world,</i>

559
00:52:22,719 --> 00:52:26,052
I have decided to marry
my dear Johanna.

560
00:52:26,156 --> 00:52:28,556
<i>Sir, happy news indeed.</i>

561
00:52:28,659 --> 00:52:30,217
<i>Strange though,</i>

562
00:52:30,827 --> 00:52:36,493
<i>when I offered myself to her,
she showed a certain reluctance.</i>

563
00:52:37,401 --> 00:52:40,097
<i>Excuse me, my lord
May I request, my lord</i>

564
00:52:40,204 --> 00:52:42,604
<i>Permission, my lord, to speak?</i>

565
00:52:42,706 --> 00:52:44,970
<i>Forgive me if I suggest, my lord</i>

566
00:52:45,075 --> 00:52:47,441
<i>You're looking less
than your best, my lord</i>

567
00:52:47,544 --> 00:52:52,243
<i>There's powder upon your vest, my lord
And stubble upon your cheek</i>

568
00:52:55,385 --> 00:52:59,287
<i>And ladies, my lord, are weak</i>

569
00:53:00,090 --> 00:53:02,354
<i>Stubble, you say?</i>

570
00:53:05,696 --> 00:53:09,154
Perhaps I am
a little overhasty in the mornings.

571
00:53:10,267 --> 00:53:12,735
<i>Fret not though, my lord
I know a place, my lord</i>

572
00:53:12,836 --> 00:53:15,361
<i>A barber, my lord, of skill</i>

573
00:53:15,472 --> 00:53:17,667
<i>Thus armed with a shaven face, my lord</i>

574
00:53:17,774 --> 00:53:20,072
<i>Some eau de cologne to grace, my lord</i>

575
00:53:20,177 --> 00:53:22,645
<i>And musk to enhance the chase
my lord</i>

576
00:53:22,746 --> 00:53:25,613
<i>You'll dazzle the girl until</i>

577
00:53:26,516 --> 00:53:27,881
Until?

578
00:53:28,452 --> 00:53:32,650
<i>She bows to your every will</i>

579
00:53:33,724 --> 00:53:35,021
Barber?

580
00:53:36,326 --> 00:53:37,350
Take me to him.

581
00:53:37,461 --> 00:53:42,160
<i>His name is Todd, my lord, and he is
the very last word in barbering.</i>

582
00:53:48,839 --> 00:53:52,275
<i>You ought to slow down a bit, lad.
It'll go straight to your head.</i>

583
00:53:52,376 --> 00:53:53,968
They used to give it to us
in the workhouse

584
00:53:54,077 --> 00:53:55,840
so as we could sleep.

585
00:53:55,946 --> 00:53:58,107
<i>Not that you'd want
to sleep in that place, ma'am.</i>

586
00:53:58,215 --> 00:54:00,581
Not with the things
what happen in the dark.

587
00:54:00,684 --> 00:54:02,015
<i>That's nice, dear.</i>

588
00:54:02,119 --> 00:54:03,950
Think I'll just pop in
on Mr. Todd for a tick.

589
00:54:04,054 --> 00:54:06,887
<i>- You all right, there?
- Leave the bottle.</i>

590
00:54:11,895 --> 00:54:15,296
That lad is drinking me
out of house and home.

591
00:54:16,300 --> 00:54:18,632
How long till Pirelli gets back?

592
00:54:19,269 --> 00:54:20,998
He won't be back.

593
00:54:22,873 --> 00:54:24,738
<i>Mr. T, you didn't.</i>

594
00:54:35,952 --> 00:54:39,547
You're barking mad.
Killing a man what done you no harm.

595
00:54:40,390 --> 00:54:44,326
He recognized me from the old days.
Tried to blackmail me.

596
00:54:45,595 --> 00:54:47,222
Half me earnings.

597
00:54:47,931 --> 00:54:50,729
<i>Oh, well, it's a different matter then.</i>

598
00:54:51,635 --> 00:54:55,127
<i>For a moment there,
I thought you'd lost your marbles.</i>

599
00:54:58,208 --> 00:54:59,835
All that blood.

600
00:55:01,345 --> 00:55:02,812
Poor bugger.

601
00:55:03,680 --> 00:55:05,045
<i>Oh, well.</i>

602
00:55:13,457 --> 00:55:15,857
<i>Well, waste not, want not.</i>

603
00:55:17,494 --> 00:55:20,759
<i>So, what are we gonna do
about the boy then?</i>

604
00:55:22,265 --> 00:55:23,789
Send him up.

605
00:55:24,735 --> 00:55:27,704
<i>Oh, we don't need to worry about him.
He's a simple thing.</i>

606
00:55:27,804 --> 00:55:29,328
Send him up!

607
00:55:32,242 --> 00:55:35,700
<i>Now, Mr. T,
surely one's enough for today.</i>

608
00:55:36,847 --> 00:55:40,339
<i>Besides, I was thinking of hiring the lad
to help me run the shop.</i>

609
00:55:40,450 --> 00:55:43,419
Your poor knees
aren't what they used to be.

610
00:55:44,221 --> 00:55:45,654
All right.

611
00:55:47,691 --> 00:55:49,989
<i>Course, we're gonna
have to stock up on the gin.</i>

612
00:55:50,093 --> 00:55:52,118
Boy drinks like a sailor.

613
00:55:56,266 --> 00:55:57,563
The Judge.

614
00:56:01,071 --> 00:56:02,333
Get out.

615
00:56:04,408 --> 00:56:05,670
Get out!

616
00:56:22,058 --> 00:56:23,548
Mr. Todd?

617
00:56:24,594 --> 00:56:26,221
At your service.

618
00:56:27,397 --> 00:56:30,525
<i>An honor to receive
your patronage, my lord.</i>

619
00:56:31,802 --> 00:56:33,497
<i>You know me, sir?</i>

620
00:56:33,904 --> 00:56:39,137
Who in this wide world
does not know the great Judge Turpin?

621
00:56:45,749 --> 00:56:47,649
<i>These premises
are hardly prepossessing,</i>

622
00:56:47,751 --> 00:56:49,582
and yet the Beadle tells me

623
00:56:49,686 --> 00:56:53,588
you're the most accomplished
of all the barbers in the city.

624
00:56:54,257 --> 00:56:56,623
<i>That is gracious of him, sir.</i>

625
00:56:57,694 --> 00:57:00,128
<i>What may I do for you today, sir?</i>

626
00:57:00,897 --> 00:57:03,695
A stylish trimming of the hair?

627
00:57:03,800 --> 00:57:05,791
Soothing skin massage?

628
00:57:05,902 --> 00:57:07,631
<i>Sit, sir. Sit.</i>

629
00:57:08,805 --> 00:57:13,765
<i>You see, sir, a man infatuate with love
Her ardent and eager slave</i>

630
00:57:13,877 --> 00:57:18,780
<i>So fetch the pomade and pumice stone
And lend me a more seductive tone</i>

631
00:57:18,882 --> 00:57:23,319
<i>A sprinkling perhaps of French cologne
But first, sir, I think</i>

632
00:57:24,387 --> 00:57:26,981
<i>a shave</i>

633
00:57:28,758 --> 00:57:31,852
<i>The closest I ever gave</i>

634
00:57:36,500 --> 00:57:38,798
<i>You're in a merry mood today, Mr. Todd.</i>

635
00:57:38,902 --> 00:57:44,067
<i>'Tis your delight, sir, catching fire
From one man to the next</i>

636
00:57:44,174 --> 00:57:46,734
<i>'Tis true, sir, love can still inspire</i>

637
00:57:46,843 --> 00:57:49,243
<i>The blood to pound
the heart leap higher</i>

638
00:57:49,346 --> 00:57:50,711
<i>- What more
- What more</i>

639
00:57:50,814 --> 00:57:52,975
<i>- can man require than love, sir
- can man require</i>

640
00:57:53,083 --> 00:57:54,277
<i>More than love, sir</i>

641
00:57:54,384 --> 00:57:55,681
<i>- What, sir?
- Women</i>

642
00:57:55,785 --> 00:57:58,219
<i>- Yes, women
- Pretty women</i>

643
00:58:29,419 --> 00:58:33,583
<i>Now then, my friend</i>

644
00:58:34,691 --> 00:58:38,559
<i>Now to your purpose</i>

645
00:58:39,563 --> 00:58:43,294
<i>Patience, enjoy it</i>

646
00:58:44,167 --> 00:58:48,604
<i>Revenge can't be taken in haste</i>

647
00:58:48,705 --> 00:58:50,900
<i>Make haste, and if we wed
You'll be commended, sir</i>

648
00:58:51,007 --> 00:58:52,372
<i>My lord</i>

649
00:58:54,978 --> 00:58:57,412
<i>And who, may it be said
Is your intended, sir?</i>

650
00:58:57,514 --> 00:59:00,005
<i>My ward</i>

651
00:59:01,251 --> 00:59:03,583
A pretty little rosebud.

652
00:59:03,687 --> 00:59:05,587
Pretty as her mother?

653
00:59:06,623 --> 00:59:09,217
What? What was that?

654
00:59:09,326 --> 00:59:13,626
<i>Nothing, sir. Nothing. May we proceed?</i>

655
00:59:15,365 --> 00:59:16,957
<i>Pretty women</i>

656
00:59:17,567 --> 00:59:21,936
<i>Fascinating
Sipping coffee</i>

657
00:59:22,806 --> 00:59:27,937
<i>Dancing
Pretty women!</i>

658
00:59:28,044 --> 00:59:30,410
<i>Are a wonder</i>

659
00:59:30,513 --> 00:59:32,981
<i>Pretty women</i>

660
00:59:35,785 --> 00:59:40,654
<i>Sitting in the window or</i>

661
00:59:40,757 --> 00:59:45,660
<i>Standing on the stair</i>

662
00:59:45,762 --> 00:59:52,361
<i>Something in them
Cheers the air</i>

663
00:59:56,039 --> 00:59:57,836
<i>Pretty women</i>

664
00:59:58,842 --> 01:00:00,673
<i>Silhouetted</i>

665
01:00:01,311 --> 01:00:03,711
<i>Stay within you</i>

666
01:00:03,813 --> 01:00:06,338
<i>Glancing!</i>

667
01:00:06,449 --> 01:00:08,713
<i>Stay forever</i>

668
01:00:08,818 --> 01:00:11,446
<i>Breathing lightly</i>

669
01:00:11,554 --> 01:00:13,647
<i>Pretty women</i>

670
01:00:13,757 --> 01:00:16,157
<i>- Pretty women
- Pretty women</i>

671
01:00:16,259 --> 01:00:21,026
<i>- Blowing out their candles or

01:00:24,501 --> 01:00:26,025
<i>Then they leave</i>

01:00:26,136 --> 01:00:28,036
<i>- Even when they leave...
- Even when they</i>

675
01:00:28,138 --> 01:00:29,662
<i>leave you and vanish...</i>

676
01:00:29,773 --> 01:00:32,674
<i>- ... they still...
- ... they somehow can still remain...</i>

677
01:00:32,776 --> 01:00:38,237
<i>- ... are there, they're there
- ... there with you</i>

678
01:00:38,348 --> 01:00:39,372
<i>- Pretty women

679
01:00:39,482 --> 01:00:41,006

01:00:51,428 --> 01:00:53,760
<i>- As you're living
- As you're living</i>

685
01:00:53,863 --> 01:00:56,263
<i>- Pretty women, sir!
- Pretty women, sir!</i>

686
01:00:56,366 --> 01:00:58,459
<i>- Pretty women, yes!
- Pretty women, yes!</i>

687
01:00:58,568 --> 01:01:01,969
<i>- Pretty women, sir
- Pretty women, pretty women</i>

688
01:01:02,072 --> 01:01:03,664
Mr. Todd! I've seen Johanna

689
01:01:03,773 --> 01:01:06,503
and she said
she'd leave with me tonight.

690
01:01:08,778 --> 01:01:10,177
You.

691
01:01:10,280 --> 01:01:14,478
There is indeed a higher power
to warn me thus in time.

692
01:01:14,584 --> 01:01:16,484
Johanna elope with you?

693
01:01:18,254 --> 01:01:19,380
I'll make sure that neither you

694
01:01:19,489 --> 01:01:22,788
nor any other man
shall ever set eyes on her again.

695
01:01:23,493 --> 01:01:24,960
<i>As for you, barber,</i>

696
01:01:25,061 --> 01:01:27,495
it's all too clear
what company you keep.

697
01:01:27,597 --> 01:01:29,690
<i>Service them well
and hold their custom,</i>

698
01:01:29,799 --> 01:01:31,596
for you'll have none of mine.

699
01:01:31,701 --> 01:01:33,931
- Mr. Todd. You have to help me.
- Out.

700
01:01:34,037 --> 01:01:35,436
<i>- Mr. Todd, please.
- Out.</i>

701
01:01:35,538 --> 01:01:37,472
- Mr. Todd!
- Out!

702
01:01:43,146 --> 01:01:44,443
All this shouting and running about.

703
01:01:44,547 --> 01:01:46,708
- What's happened?
- I had him.

704
01:01:46,816 --> 01:01:48,010
<i>The sailor busted in, I know.</i>

705
01:01:48,118 --> 01:01:49,551
And then I saw them both
running down the stairs.

706
01:01:49,652 --> 01:01:51,119
I had him!

707
01:01:51,221 --> 01:01:53,280
<i>His throat was bare beneath my hand</i>

708
01:01:53,389 --> 01:01:56,290
<i>- There, there, dear. Calm down.
- No, I had him!</i>

709
01:01:56,392 --> 01:01:58,826
<i>His throat was there
And he'll never come again!</i>

710
01:01:58,928 --> 01:02:01,863
<i>Easy now. Hush, love, hush</i>

711
01:02:01,965 --> 01:02:03,990
<i>- I'll keep telling you
- When?</i>

712
01:02:04,100 --> 01:02:06,193
<i>- What's your rush?
- Why did I wait?</i>

713
01:02:06,302 --> 01:02:10,204
<i>You told me to wait!
Now he'll never come again!</i>

714
01:02:12,742 --> 01:02:14,642
<i>There's a hole in the world
like a great black pit</i>

715
01:02:14,744 --> 01:02:16,644
<i>And it's filled with people
who are filled with shit</i>

716
01:02:16,746 --> 01:02:19,909
<i>And the vermin of the world inhabit it</i>

717
01:02:20,016 --> 01:02:22,541
<i>But not for long!</i>

718
01:02:25,655 --> 01:02:29,887
<i>They all deserve to die</i>

719
01:02:29,993 --> 01:02:34,396
<i>Tell you why, Mrs. Lovett
Tell you why</i>

720
01:02:34,497 --> 01:02:37,261
<i>Because in all of
the whole human race, Mrs. Lovett</i>

721
01:02:37,367 --> 01:02:39,699
<i>There are two kinds of men
and only two</i>

722
01:02:39,803 --> 01:02:41,896
<i>There's the one staying put
In his proper place</i>

723
01:02:42,005 --> 01:02:44,303
<i>And the one with his foot
In the other one's face</i>

724
01:02:44,407 --> 01:02:46,568
<i>Look at me, Mrs. Lovett, look at you!</i>

725
01:02:46,676 --> 01:02:51,010
<i>No, we all deserve to die</i>

726
01:02:51,114 --> 01:02:55,551
<i>Even you, Mrs. Lovett
Even I</i>

727
01:02:55,652 --> 01:02:58,382
<i>Because the lives of the wicked
should be made brief</i>

728
01:02:58,488 --> 01:03:00,683
<i>For the rest of us, death will be a relief</i>

729
01:03:00,790 --> 01:03:05,090
<i>We all deserve to die</i>

730
01:03:05,195 --> 01:03:11,327
<i>And I'll never see Johanna</i>

731
01:03:11,434 --> 01:03:17,566
<i>No, I'll never hug my girl to me</i>

732
01:03:17,674 --> 01:03:19,403
<i>Finished!</i>

733
01:03:20,777 --> 01:03:24,474
<i>All right! You, sir. How about a shave?</i>

734
01:03:24,581 --> 01:03:28,347
Come and visit
your good friend Sweeney.

735
01:03:28,451 --> 01:03:31,284
<i>You, sir, too, sir.
Welcome to the grave!</i>

736
01:03:31,387 --> 01:03:35,380
<i>I will have vengeance</i>

737
01:03:35,491 --> 01:03:40,622
<i>I will have salvation</i>

738
01:03:42,565 --> 01:03:43,554
<i>Who, sir?</i>

739
01:03:43,666 --> 01:03:46,328
<i>You, sir? No one's in the chair.
Come on, come on.</i>

740
01:03:46,436 --> 01:03:49,997
Sweeney's waiting! I want you bleeders.

741
01:03:50,106 --> 01:03:53,405
<i>You, sir! Anybody!
Gentlemen, now don't be shy!</i>

742
01:03:53,509 --> 01:03:59,175
<i>Not one man, no, nor ten men</i>

743
01:03:59,282 --> 01:04:05,710
<i>Nor a hundred can assuage me</i>

744
01:04:05,822 --> 01:04:09,724
<i>I will have you</i>

745
01:04:10,293 --> 01:04:13,820
<i>And I will get him back
Even as he gloats</i>

746
01:04:13,930 --> 01:04:17,229
<i>In the meantime
I'll practice on less honorable throats</i>

747
01:04:17,333 --> 01:04:23,602
<i>And my Lucy lies in ashes</i>

748
01:04:23,706 --> 01:04:30,339
<i>And I'll never see my girl again</i>

749
01:04:30,446 --> 01:04:33,938
<i>But the work waits!</i>

750
01:04:35,151 --> 01:04:38,086
<i>I'm alive at last!</i>

751
01:04:38,621 --> 01:04:44,719
<i>And I'm full of joy!</i>

752
01:04:51,401 --> 01:04:53,164
<i>That's all very well,
but what are we gonna do about him?</i>

753
01:04:58,737 --> 01:04:59,999
Hello?

754
01:05:03,575 --> 01:05:05,133
Do you hear me?

755
01:05:08,246 --> 01:05:09,736
Come on.

756
01:05:10,515 --> 01:05:12,710
You great useless thing.

757
01:05:19,024 --> 01:05:20,457
Sit down.

758
01:05:40,445 --> 01:05:42,310
There. Drink it down.

759
01:05:44,416 --> 01:05:48,011
<i>Now, we got a body
moldering away upstairs.</i>

760
01:05:48,119 --> 01:05:51,020
<i>Now, what do you intend
we should do about that, then?</i>

761
01:05:51,122 --> 01:05:53,386
<i>Later on when it's dark,</i>

762
01:05:53,491 --> 01:05:56,790
we'll take it to some secret place
and bury it.

763
01:05:56,895 --> 01:05:59,489
<i>Oh, yeah. Course we could do that.</i>

764
01:06:02,667 --> 01:06:04,134
Don't suppose he's got any relatives

765
01:06:04,235 --> 01:06:06,100
that's gonna come poking around
looking for him.

766
01:06:11,476 --> 01:06:14,206
<i>Seems a downright shame</i>

767
01:06:14,546 --> 01:06:15,808
Shame?

768
01:06:17,449 --> 01:06:19,679
<i>Seems an awful waste</i>

769
01:06:21,786 --> 01:06:25,722
<i>Such a nice plump frame
What's his name has</i>

770
01:06:25,824 --> 01:06:28,156
<i>Had, has</i>

771
01:06:28,660 --> 01:06:31,390
<i>Nor it can't be traced</i>

772
01:06:32,497 --> 01:06:35,091
<i>Business needs a lift</i>

773
01:06:35,900 --> 01:06:38,391
<i>Debts to be erased</i>

774
01:06:39,237 --> 01:06:42,434
<i>Think of it as thrift, as a gift</i>

775
01:06:43,141 --> 01:06:45,234
If you get my drift.

776
01:06:45,877 --> 01:06:49,278
<i>Seems an awful waste</i>

777
01:06:51,549 --> 01:06:54,677
<i>I mean, with the price of meat what it is</i>

778
01:06:54,953 --> 01:06:58,047
<i>When you get it, if you get it</i>

779
01:06:58,623 --> 01:06:59,749
<i>Good, you got it</i>

780
01:06:59,858 --> 01:07:03,817
<i>Take, for instance
Mrs. Mooney and her pie shop</i>

781
01:07:03,928 --> 01:07:08,024
<i>Business never better
using only pussycats and toast</i>

782
01:07:08,133 --> 01:07:12,001
<i>Now a pussy's good for
maybe six or seven at the most</i>

783
01:07:12,103 --> 01:07:14,003
<i>And I'm sure they can't
compare as far as taste</i>

784
01:07:14,105 --> 01:07:16,665
<i>Mrs. Lovett, what a charming notion
Eminently practical</i>

785
01:07:16,775 --> 01:07:19,073
<i>- And yet appropriate as always
- Well, it does seem a waste</i>

786
01:07:19,177 --> 01:07:21,941
<i>Mrs. Lovett, how I've lived without you
All these years I'll never know!</i>

787
01:07:22,046 --> 01:07:23,035
<i>Think about it</i>

788
01:07:23,148 --> 01:07:24,172
<i>- lots of other gentlemen'll...
- How delectable!</i>

789
01:07:24,282 --> 01:07:25,613
<i>- ... soon be coming for a shave
- Also undetectable</i>

790
01:07:25,717 --> 01:07:28,515
<i>- Won't they? Think of all them pies!
- How choice! How rare!</i>

791
01:07:28,620 --> 01:07:32,215
<i>For what's the sound
of the world out there?</i>

792
01:07:32,323 --> 01:07:35,258
<i>What, Mr. Todd, what, Mr. Todd
What is that sound?</i>

793
01:07:35,360 --> 01:07:38,887
<i>Those crunching
noises pervading the air?</i>

794
01:07:38,997 --> 01:07:41,898
<i>Yes, Mr. Todd
Yes, Mr. Todd, yes, all around</i>

795
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:45,265
<i>It's man devouring man, my dear</i>

796
01:07:45,370 --> 01:07:49,898
<i>- And who are we to deny it in here?
- And who are we to deny it in here?</i>

797
01:07:53,278 --> 01:07:56,179
<i>These are desperate times, Mrs. Lovett.</i>

798
01:07:56,881 --> 01:07:59,816
And desperate measures are called for.

799
01:08:00,084 --> 01:08:03,451
<i>Here we are, hot out of the oven.</i>

800
01:08:04,522 --> 01:08:05,716
What is that?

801
01:08:05,824 --> 01:08:08,850
<i>It's priest
Have a little priest</i>

802
01:08:08,960 --> 01:08:12,361
<i>- Is it really good?
- Sir, it's too good, at least</i>

803
01:08:12,464 --> 01:08:15,729
<i>Then again
they don't commit sins of the flesh</i>

804
01:08:15,834 --> 01:08:17,699
<i>So it's pretty fresh</i>

805
01:08:19,370 --> 01:08:20,997
<i>Awful lot of fat</i>

806
01:08:21,105 --> 01:08:22,538
<i>Only where it sat</i>

807
01:08:22,640 --> 01:08:26,201
<i>Haven't you got poet
or something like that?</i>

808
01:08:26,311 --> 01:08:31,112
<i>No, you see the trouble with poet is
how do you know it's deceased?</i>

809
01:08:31,216 --> 01:08:33,241
<i>Try the priest</i>

810
01:08:42,227 --> 01:08:44,092
Lawyer's rather nice.

811
01:08:44,195 --> 01:08:45,992
<i>If it's for a price</i>

812
01:08:46,097 --> 01:08:51,000
<i>Order something else, though, to follow
Since no one should swallow it twice</i>

813
01:08:51,102 --> 01:08:52,797
<i>Anything that's lean?</i>

814
01:08:52,904 --> 01:08:57,773
<i>Well, then, if you're British and loyal
You might enjoy Royal Marine</i>

815
01:08:57,876 --> 01:08:59,605
<i>Anyway, it's clean</i>

816
01:08:59,711 --> 01:09:02,874
<i>Though, of course
it tastes of wherever it's been</i>

817
01:09:02,981 --> 01:09:06,382
<i>Is that squire on the fire?</i>

818
01:09:06,484 --> 01:09:09,920
<i>Mercy no, sir, look closer
You'll notice it's grocer</i>

819
01:09:10,021 --> 01:09:13,013
<i>Looks thicker
More like vicar</i>

820
01:09:13,124 --> 01:09:16,423
<i>No, it has to be grocer
It's green</i>

821
01:09:19,931 --> 01:09:23,662
<i>The history of the world, my love</i>

822
01:09:23,768 --> 01:09:26,430
<i>Save a lot of graves
Do a lot of relatives favors</i>

823
01:09:26,538 --> 01:09:30,497
<i>Is those below serving those up above</i>

824
01:09:30,608 --> 01:09:33,168
<i>Everybody shaves
So there should be plenty of flavors</i>

825
01:09:33,278 --> 01:09:36,406
<i>How gratifying for once to know</i>

826
01:09:36,514 --> 01:09:37,947
<i>- That those above
- That those above</i>

827
01:09:38,049 --> 01:09:42,008
<i>- will serve those down below!
- will serve those down below!</i>

828
01:09:48,293 --> 01:09:49,317
What is that?

829
01:09:49,427 --> 01:09:52,828
<i>It's fop
Finest in the shop</i>

830
01:09:52,931 --> 01:09:57,630
<i>Or we have some shepherd's pie
peppered with actual shepherd on top</i>

831
01:09:57,735 --> 01:09:59,498
<i>And I've just begun</i>

832
01:09:59,604 --> 01:10:04,507
<i>Here's the politician, so oily
It's served with a doily, have one</i>

833
01:10:04,609 --> 01:10:06,304
<i>Put it on a bun</i>

834
01:10:06,411 --> 01:10:09,812
<i>Well, you never know if it's going to run</i>

835
01:10:09,914 --> 01:10:13,042
<i>Try the friar, fried, it's drier</i>

836
01:10:13,151 --> 01:10:16,917
<i>No, the clergy is really
Too coarse and too mealy</i>

837
01:10:17,021 --> 01:10:20,149
<i>Then actor
It's compacter</i>

838
01:10:20,258 --> 01:10:23,193
<i>But always arrives overdone</i>

839
01:10:23,294 --> 01:10:26,661
I'll come again
when you have judge on the menu.

840
01:10:33,071 --> 01:10:36,598
<i>Have charity towards the world, my pet</i>

841
01:10:36,708 --> 01:10:39,643
<i>Yes, yes, I know, my love</i>

842
01:10:39,744 --> 01:10:43,339
<i>We'll take the customers
that we can get</i>

843
01:10:43,448 --> 01:10:46,076
<i>High-born and low, my love</i>

844
01:10:46,184 --> 01:10:49,176
<i>We'll not discriminate great from small</i>

845
01:10:49,287 --> 01:10:51,380
<i>No, we'll serve anyone</i>

846
01:10:51,489 --> 01:10:53,013
<i>- We'll serve anyone
- Meaning anyone</i>

847
01:10:53,124 --> 01:10:57,254
<i>- And to anyone at all!
- And to anyone at all!</i>

848
01:11:16,714 --> 01:11:18,181
<i>So, it's true.</i>

849
01:11:19,117 --> 01:11:23,781
<i>Sir, a gentleman knocks
before entering a lady's room.</i>

850
01:11:24,022 --> 01:11:26,684
<i>Indeed he does, but I see no lady.</i>

851
01:11:29,560 --> 01:11:32,085
<i>I told myself the sailor was lying,</i>

852
01:11:32,196 --> 01:11:36,565
<i>that my Johanna would never betray me,
never hurt me so.</i>

853
01:11:36,668 --> 01:11:39,432
<i>Sir, I will leave this place.</i>

854
01:11:40,605 --> 01:11:43,335
I think that only appropriate

855
01:11:43,441 --> 01:11:47,639
since you no longer find
my company to your liking.

856
01:11:50,181 --> 01:11:53,116
We shall provide you with new lodgings.

857
01:11:55,953 --> 01:11:59,753
Until this moment I have spared the rod.

858
01:12:01,025 --> 01:12:04,722
But the ungrateful child
has broken my heart.

859
01:12:06,330 --> 01:12:08,264
<i>When you've learned
to appreciate what you have,</i>

860
01:12:08,366 --> 01:12:10,061
perhaps we shall meet again.

861
01:12:10,168 --> 01:12:11,726
Until then

862
01:12:13,271 --> 01:12:16,138
think on your sins.

863
01:12:23,347 --> 01:12:24,541
No!

864
01:12:28,653 --> 01:12:30,177
<i>No, please!</i>

865
01:12:33,558 --> 01:12:36,721
Johanna! Where are you taking her?
Tell me or I swear I'II...

866
01:12:36,828 --> 01:12:39,353
<i>You'd kill me, boy? Here I stand!</i>

867
01:12:41,199 --> 01:12:42,689
Johanna!

868
01:13:49,200 --> 01:13:53,534
<i>I feel you</i>

869
01:13:53,638 --> 01:13:57,472
<i>Johanna</i>

870
01:13:57,575 --> 01:14:01,443
<i>I feel you</i>

871
01:14:02,079 --> 01:14:05,674
<i>Do they think that walls can hide you?</i>

872
01:14:05,783 --> 01:14:09,617
<i>Even now, I'm at your window</i>

873
01:14:09,720 --> 01:14:14,157
<i>I am in the dark beside you</i>

874
01:14:14,258 --> 01:14:19,389
<i>Buried sweetly in your yellow hair</i>

875
01:14:19,497 --> 01:14:23,991
<i>Johanna</i>

876
01:14:32,009 --> 01:14:35,570
<i>And are you beautiful and pale</i>

877
01:14:35,680 --> 01:14:38,774
<i>With yellow hair, like her?</i>

878
01:14:38,883 --> 01:14:42,341
<i>I'd want you beautiful and pale</i>

879
01:14:42,453 --> 01:14:48,688
<i>The way I've dreamed you were
Johanna</i>

880
01:14:52,129 --> 01:14:58,534
<i>And if you're beautiful
what then with yellow hair, like wheat</i>

881
01:14:58,636 --> 01:15:02,197
<i>I think we shall not meet again</i>

882
01:15:02,306 --> 01:15:05,275
<i>My little dove, my sweet Johanna</i>

883
01:15:05,376 --> 01:15:11,713
<i>I'll steal you, Johanna!</i>

884
01:15:11,816 --> 01:15:14,148
<i>Goodbye, Johanna!</i>

885
01:15:15,186 --> 01:15:18,280
<i>You're gone, and yet you're mine</i>

886
01:15:18,389 --> 01:15:20,721
<i>I'm fine, Johanna</i>

887
01:15:20,825 --> 01:15:27,526
<i>- I'm fine!
- Johanna</i>

888
01:15:34,338 --> 01:15:40,709
<i>Smoke! Smoke! Sign of the devil
Sign of the devil. City on fire!</i>

889
01:15:40,811 --> 01:15:43,905
<i>Witch! Witch! Smell it, sir
An evil smell</i>

890
01:15:44,015 --> 01:15:45,710
<i>Every night at the vespers bell</i>

891
01:15:45,816 --> 01:15:47,443
<i>Smoke that comes from
the mouth of hell</i>

892
01:15:47,551 --> 01:15:50,520
<i>City on fire!</i>

893
01:15:50,621 --> 01:15:53,818
<i>City on fire</i>

894
01:15:54,625 --> 01:15:57,185
Mischief! Mischief! Mischief!

895
01:16:05,636 --> 01:16:12,098
<i>And if I never hear your voice
My turtledove, my dear</i>

896
01:16:12,209 --> 01:16:17,875
<i>I still have reason to rejoice
The way ahead is clear</i>

897
01:16:17,982 --> 01:16:22,180
<i>Johanna</i>

898
01:16:23,988 --> 01:16:24,977
<i>I feel</i>

899
01:16:25,089 --> 01:16:30,652
<i>And in that darkness when I'm blind
With what I can't forget</i>

900
01:16:30,761 --> 01:16:31,785
<i>Johanna</i>

901
01:16:31,896 --> 01:16:34,922
<i>It's always morning in my mind</i>

902
01:16:35,032 --> 01:16:41,301
<i>My little lamb, my pet, Johanna</i>

903
01:16:44,308 --> 01:16:47,471
<i>- You stay, Johanna...
- Johanna</i>

904
01:16:47,578 --> 01:16:50,308
<i>...the way I've dreamed you are</i>

905
01:16:50,815 --> 01:16:54,410
<i>Oh, look, Johanna! A star!</i>

906
01:16:54,518 --> 01:16:59,080
<i>Buried sweetly in your yellow hair</i>

907
01:16:59,190 --> 01:17:02,591
<i>A shooting star!</i>

908
01:17:06,497 --> 01:17:10,433
<i>There, there, somebody, somebody
look up there. Didn't I tell you?</i>

909
01:17:10,534 --> 01:17:14,436
<i>Smell that air. City on fire!</i>

910
01:17:14,538 --> 01:17:17,439
<i>Quick, sir, run and tell
Warn them all of the witch's spell</i>

911
01:17:17,541 --> 01:17:19,168
<i>There it is, there it is, the unholy smell</i>

912
01:17:19,276 --> 01:17:21,471
<i>Tell it to the Beadle and police as well
Tell them! Tell them</i>

913
01:17:21,579 --> 01:17:25,413
<i>Help, fiend! City on fire!</i>

914
01:17:25,516 --> 01:17:28,917
<i>City on fire</i>

915
01:17:29,020 --> 01:17:30,783
Mischief. Mischief.

916
01:17:40,631 --> 01:17:47,059
<i>And though I'll think of you, I guess
Until the day I die</i>

917
01:17:47,171 --> 01:17:52,871
<i>I think I miss you less and less
As every day goes by</i>

918
01:17:52,977 --> 01:17:59,712
<i>- Johanna
- Johanna</i>

919
01:17:59,817 --> 01:18:06,154
<i>And you'd be beautiful and pale
And look too much like her</i>

920
01:18:06,257 --> 01:18:11,957
<i>If only angels could prevail
We'd be the way we were</i>

921
01:18:12,063 --> 01:18:18,935
<i>- Johanna
- I feel you, Johanna</i>

922
01:18:19,036 --> 01:18:22,062
<i>Wake up, Johanna</i>

923
01:18:22,173 --> 01:18:25,267
<i>Another bright red day</i>

924
01:18:25,376 --> 01:18:32,077
<i>We learn, Johanna, to say</i>

925
01:18:33,751 --> 01:18:35,241
<i>Goodbye</i>

926
01:18:38,923 --> 01:18:42,484
<i>I'll steal</i>

927
01:18:45,563 --> 01:18:50,432
<i>you</i>

928
01:19:27,905 --> 01:19:31,671
<i>Ladies and gentlemen
May I have your attention, please?</i>

929
01:19:33,244 --> 01:19:35,235
<i>Are your nostrils a-quiver
and tingling as well</i>

930
01:19:35,346 --> 01:19:38,406
<i>At that delicate
luscious ambrosial smell?</i>

931
01:19:38,516 --> 01:19:40,609
<i>Yes, they are, I can tell</i>

932
01:19:40,718 --> 01:19:44,552
<i>Well, ladies and gentlemen
That aroma enriching the breeze</i>

933
01:19:44,655 --> 01:19:46,589
<i>Is like nothing
compared to its succulent source</i>

934
01:19:46,690 --> 01:19:50,353
<i>As the gourmets among you
will tell you, of course</i>

935
01:19:50,461 --> 01:19:55,296
<i>Ladies and gentlemen
You can't imagine the rapture in store</i>

936
01:19:56,333 --> 01:19:58,631
<i>Just inside of this door!</i>

937
01:20:02,907 --> 01:20:06,365
<i>There you'll sample
Mrs. Lovett's meat pies</i>

938
01:20:06,477 --> 01:20:09,935
<i>Savory and sweet pies
As you'll see</i>

939
01:20:10,047 --> 01:20:13,505
<i>You who eat pies
Mrs. Lovett's meat pies</i>

940
01:20:13,617 --> 01:20:17,109
<i>Conjure up the treat
pies used to be!</i>

941
01:20:20,858 --> 01:20:22,587
<i>- Toby!
- Coming!</i>

942
01:20:23,661 --> 01:20:25,390
<i>- Ale there!
- Right, ma'am!</i>

943
01:20:25,496 --> 01:20:26,895
<i>Quick, now!</i>

944
01:20:28,132 --> 01:20:31,761
<i>Nice to see you, dearie
How have you been keeping?</i>

945
01:20:31,869 --> 01:20:35,464
<i>Cor, me bones is weary
Toby! One for the gentleman</i>

946
01:20:35,573 --> 01:20:39,134
<i>Hear the birdies cheeping
Helps to keep it cheery</i>

947
01:20:39,243 --> 01:20:42,679
<i>Toby! Throw the old woman out!</i>

948
01:20:42,780 --> 01:20:46,580
<i>What's my secret?
Frankly, dear, forgive my candor</i>

949
01:20:46,684 --> 01:20:50,142
<i>Family secret
All to do with herbs</i>

950
01:20:50,254 --> 01:20:53,712
<i>Things like being
careful with your coriander</i>

951
01:20:53,824 --> 01:20:56,555
<i>That's what makes the gravy grander!</i>

952
01:21:06,403 --> 01:21:09,930
<i>Eat them slow and feel the crust
How thin she rolled it</i>

953
01:21:10,040 --> 01:21:13,669
<i>Eat them slow
'cause every one's a prize!</i>

954
01:21:13,777 --> 01:21:17,213
<i>Eat them slow 'cause that's the lot
and now we've sold it!</i>

955
01:21:17,314 --> 01:21:18,576
<i>Come again tomorrow!</i>

956
01:21:18,682 --> 01:21:19,979
<i>Hold it!</i>

957
01:21:20,985 --> 01:21:23,044
<i>Bless my eyes!</i>

958
01:21:24,688 --> 01:21:26,622
<i>Fresh supplies!</i>

959
01:21:26,724 --> 01:21:28,089
<i>- How about it, dearie?
- Is that a pie...</i>

960
01:21:28,192 --> 01:21:29,989
<i>- Be here in a twinkling!
- ... fit for a king</i>

961
01:21:30,094 --> 01:21:32,722
<i>- Just confirms me theory, Toby!
- A wondrous sweet</i>

962
01:21:32,830 --> 01:21:33,990
<i>- and most delectable thing?
- God watches over us</i>

963
01:21:34,098 --> 01:21:35,793
<i>Didn't have an inkling, positively eerie</i>

964
01:21:35,899 --> 01:21:37,196
<i>You see, ma'am
why there's no meat pie</i>

965
01:21:37,301 --> 01:21:39,963
Toby! Throw the old woman out!

966
01:21:48,045 --> 01:21:51,310
Still got to keep an eye
on the household expenditure.

967
01:21:52,950 --> 01:21:55,578
<i>Which isn't to say we couldn't get
some nice taxidermy animals,</i>

968
01:21:55,686 --> 01:21:57,984
bring a touch of gentility to the place.

969
01:21:58,088 --> 01:22:00,579
<i>You know, a boar's head or two?</i>

970
01:22:01,792 --> 01:22:05,558
- Mr. T? You listening to me?
- Of course.

971
01:22:06,163 --> 01:22:11,226
- Then what did I just say?
- There must be a way to the Judge.

972
01:22:11,335 --> 01:22:14,463
Judge. Always harping
on the bloody old judge.

973
01:22:15,506 --> 01:22:17,736
We got a nice
respectable business now.

974
01:22:17,841 --> 01:22:19,706
Money coming in regular-like.

975
01:22:19,810 --> 01:22:21,505
<i>And since we're careful
to pick and choose,</i>

976
01:22:21,612 --> 01:22:25,776
<i>strangers, people who won't be missed,
who's gonna catch on?</i>

977
01:22:27,418 --> 01:22:29,545
<i>Mr. Todd, I'm so happy</i>

978
01:22:29,653 --> 01:22:31,780
<i>I could eat you up, I really could</i>

979
01:22:31,889 --> 01:22:35,120
<i>You know what I'd like to do, Mr. Todd?
What I dream?</i>

980
01:22:35,225 --> 01:22:38,922
<i>If the business stays as good
Where I'd really like to go</i>

981
01:22:39,530 --> 01:22:43,864
<i>In a year or so?
Don't you want to know?</i>

982
01:22:43,967 --> 01:22:45,093
Of course.

983
01:22:45,202 --> 01:22:47,033
<i>Do you really want to know?</i>

984
01:22:47,137 --> 01:22:49,037
<i>Yes, I do.</i>

985
01:23:03,787 --> 01:23:06,756
<i>By the sea, Mr. Todd
That's the life I'll covet</i>

986
01:23:06,857 --> 01:23:09,724
<i>By the sea, Mr. Todd
Oh, I know you'd love it</i>

987
01:23:09,827 --> 01:23:14,855
<i>You and me, Mr. T, we could be alone
In a house what we'd almost own</i>

988
01:23:14,965 --> 01:23:18,196
<i>- Down by the sea
- Anything you say</i>

989
01:23:18,302 --> 01:23:21,100
<i>Wouldn't that be smashing?</i>

990
01:23:22,005 --> 01:23:25,133
<i>Think how snug it'll be
Underneath our flannel</i>

991
01:23:25,242 --> 01:23:28,211
<i>When it's just you and me
And the English Channel</i>

992
01:23:28,312 --> 01:23:31,110
<i>In our cozy retreat
Kept all neat and tidy</i>

993
01:23:31,215 --> 01:23:36,380
<i>We'll have chums over every Friday
By the sea</i>

994
01:23:36,487 --> 01:23:41,982
<i>Don't you love the weather
by the sea?</i>

995
01:23:42,860 --> 01:23:45,954
<i>We'll grow old together</i>

996
01:23:46,263 --> 01:23:50,723
<i>By the seaside
By the beautiful sea</i>

997
01:23:55,839 --> 01:23:58,831
<i>It'll be so quiet that who'll come by it</i>

998
01:23:58,942 --> 01:24:01,274
<i>except a seagull?</i>

999
01:24:02,146 --> 01:24:06,583
<i>We shouldn't try it
though, till it's legal for two!</i>

1000
01:24:07,951 --> 01:24:11,079
<i>But a seaside wedding could be devised</i>

1001
01:24:11,188 --> 01:24:14,021
<i>Me rumpled bedding legitimized</i>

1002
01:24:14,124 --> 01:24:19,756
<i>Me eyelids'll flutter, I'll turn into butter
The moment I mutter "I do!"</i>

1003
01:24:19,863 --> 01:24:23,526
Will you take this woman
to be your lawfully wedded wife?

1004
01:24:27,671 --> 01:24:29,696
You may kiss your bride.

1005
01:24:42,085 --> 01:24:47,955
<i>Down by the sea
Married nice and proper</i>

1006
01:24:48,158 --> 01:24:53,755
<i>By the sea
Bring along your chopper</i>

1007
01:24:53,864 --> 01:25:00,326
<i>To the seaside
By the beautiful sea</i>

1008
01:25:18,555 --> 01:25:21,183
<i>I brought you some breakfast, dear.</i>

1009
01:25:25,062 --> 01:25:28,088
Mr. T? Can I ask you a question?

1010
01:25:29,299 --> 01:25:30,391
What?

1011
01:25:31,468 --> 01:25:33,766
What did your Lucy look like?

1012
01:25:36,707 --> 01:25:38,971
<i>Can't really remember, can you?</i>

1013
01:25:40,310 --> 01:25:42,278
She had yellow hair.

1014
01:25:44,214 --> 01:25:47,115
<i>You gotta leave this all behind,
you know.</i>

1015
01:25:48,919 --> 01:25:50,511
She's gone.

1016
01:25:52,155 --> 01:25:54,453
<i>Life is for the alive, my dear.</i>

1017
01:25:55,592 --> 01:25:58,322
<i>We could have a life, us two.</i>

1018
01:25:58,428 --> 01:26:00,453
Maybe not like I dreamed.

1019
01:26:01,532 --> 01:26:03,693
Maybe not like you remember.

1020
01:26:04,768 --> 01:26:06,565
But we could get by.

1021
01:26:15,178 --> 01:26:19,308
<i>- Mr. Todd! Mrs. Lovett, ma'am?
- What is it, Anthony?</i>

1022
01:26:19,416 --> 01:26:23,284
- He has her locked in a madhouse.
- Johanna.

1023
01:26:23,387 --> 01:26:24,854
Fogg's Asylum.

1024
01:26:24,955 --> 01:26:29,722
I've circled the place a dozen times.
There's no way in. It's a fortress.

1025
01:26:29,826 --> 01:26:32,727
- I've got him.
- Mr. Todd?

1026
01:26:33,997 --> 01:26:35,624
We've got her.

1027
01:26:36,967 --> 01:26:38,332
Where do you suppose
all the wigmakers

1028
01:26:38,435 --> 01:26:40,869
in London go to obtain their hair?

1029
01:26:41,672 --> 01:26:42,900
Bedlam.

1030
01:26:43,707 --> 01:26:47,575
- They get it from the lunatics at Bedlam.
- I don't understand.

1031
01:26:49,079 --> 01:26:52,105
We shall set you up
as a wigmaker's apprentice.

1032
01:26:52,215 --> 01:26:55,343
That'll gain you access.
And then you take her.

1033
01:26:56,086 --> 01:26:57,747
<i>Go, quickly, go!</i>

1034
01:26:59,256 --> 01:27:00,689
Fetch the boy.

1035
01:27:00,791 --> 01:27:04,124
Don't you think you should
leave the boy behind?

1036
01:27:18,675 --> 01:27:22,771
<i>- Toby. Mr. Todd needs you.
- Yes, ma'am.</i>

1037
01:27:35,759 --> 01:27:37,090
Mr. T?

1038
01:27:39,663 --> 01:27:43,622
<i>- Do you know where the Old Bailey is?
- Yes, sir. Not that I ever been there.</i>

1039
01:27:43,734 --> 01:27:47,830
Take this there.
Seek out a Judge Turpin. Repeat that.

1040
01:27:47,938 --> 01:27:50,406
Go to Old Bailey. Find Judge Turpin.

1041
01:27:50,507 --> 01:27:53,943
<i>You put that into his hands.
Only to him, you understand?</i>

1042
01:27:54,044 --> 01:27:55,136
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

1043
01:27:55,245 --> 01:27:57,509
<i>And while I'm out, do you mind
if I stop by the grocer just to pick...</i>

1044
01:27:57,614 --> 01:28:00,276
<i>No. You're not to stop,
you're not to speak.</i>

1045
01:28:00,384 --> 01:28:02,978
You're to deliver the letter.
Do you understand?

1046
01:28:03,086 --> 01:28:04,610
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

1047
01:28:34,785 --> 01:28:36,252
<i>Where you been, lad?</i>

1048
01:28:36,353 --> 01:28:41,017
We had quite the rush at dinner time.
Me poor bones is ready to drop.

1049
01:28:41,124 --> 01:28:43,422
Mr. Todd sent me on an errand.

1050
01:28:43,527 --> 01:28:44,516
<i>And on the way back,</i>

1051
01:28:44,628 --> 01:28:47,495
<i>I went by the workhouse,
just to take a look.</i>

1052
01:28:47,597 --> 01:28:51,397
<i>And I was thinking, but for you,
I'd be there now.</i>

1053
01:28:52,502 --> 01:28:54,299
Or someplace worse.

1054
01:28:54,404 --> 01:28:56,395
Seems like the good Lord
sent you for me.

1055
01:28:56,506 --> 01:28:59,873
<i>Oh, love, I feel quite the same way.</i>

1056
01:28:59,976 --> 01:29:01,876
<i>Listen to me, please.</i>

1057
01:29:01,978 --> 01:29:04,242
You know there's nothing
I wouldn't do for you.

1058
01:29:04,347 --> 01:29:07,475
<i>Say, if there were someone around,</i>

1059
01:29:08,385 --> 01:29:10,148
someone bad?

1060
01:29:10,754 --> 01:29:13,154
Only you didn't know it.

1061
01:29:13,256 --> 01:29:16,987
What is this?
What are you talking about?

1062
01:29:19,129 --> 01:29:25,591
<i>Nothing's gonna harm you
Not while I'm around</i>

1063
01:29:27,070 --> 01:29:32,565
<i>Nothing's gonna harm you
No, sir, not while I'm around</i>

1064
01:29:32,676 --> 01:29:34,200
What do you mean "someone bad"?

1065
01:29:34,311 --> 01:29:40,841
<i>Demons are prowling everywhere
nowadays</i>

1066
01:29:41,685 --> 01:29:47,954
<i>I'll send them howling, I don't care
I got ways</i>

1067
01:29:49,226 --> 01:29:52,161
<i>Hush, darling, there's no need for this.</i>

1068
01:29:53,897 --> 01:30:00,268
<i>No one's gonna hurt you
No one's gonna dare</i>

1069
01:30:01,538 --> 01:30:07,170
<i>Others can desert you
Not to worry, whistle, I'll be there</i>

1070
01:30:08,011 --> 01:30:11,777
<i>Demons will charm you
With a smile</i>

1071
01:30:11,882 --> 01:30:17,684
<i>For a while, but in time</i>

1072
01:30:17,788 --> 01:30:20,552
<i>Nothing can harm you</i>

1073
01:30:21,792 --> 01:30:26,923
<i>Not while I'm around</i>

1074
01:30:30,534 --> 01:30:32,195
<i>That's nice, dear.</i>

1075
01:30:32,903 --> 01:30:37,533
<i>Now, what is all this foolishness?
What are you talking about?</i>

1076
01:30:38,275 --> 01:30:42,143
Little things that
I've been thinking about Mr. Todd.

1077
01:30:43,113 --> 01:30:48,107
<i>Not to worry, not to worry
I may not be smart, but I ain't dumb</i>

1078
01:30:49,386 --> 01:30:54,585
<i>I can do it, put me to it
Show me something I can overcome</i>

1079
01:30:55,859 --> 01:30:59,886
<i>Not to worry, ma'am</i>

1080
01:31:02,699 --> 01:31:07,193
<i>Being close and being clever
Ain't like being true</i>

1081
01:31:08,271 --> 01:31:13,800
<i>I don't need to, I won't never
Hide a thing from you</i>

1082
01:31:13,910 --> 01:31:17,311
<i>Like some</i>

1083
01:31:19,082 --> 01:31:23,280
<i>Now, Toby, dear, haven't we
had enough of this foolish chatter?</i>

1084
01:31:23,386 --> 01:31:24,717
Here.

1085
01:31:24,821 --> 01:31:29,986
How about I give you
a nice shiny new penny

1086
01:31:30,093 --> 01:31:32,823
and you go get us some toffees?

1087
01:31:35,165 --> 01:31:36,826
That's Signor Pirelli's purse!

1088
01:31:36,933 --> 01:31:39,766
<i>No, it's not. Just something Mr. T
gave me for my birthday.</i>

1089
01:31:39,870 --> 01:31:41,770
<i>That proves it! We gotta go, ma'am.</i>

1090
01:31:41,872 --> 01:31:43,999
We gotta find the Beadle
and get the law here!

1091
01:31:44,140 --> 01:31:46,973
<i>Toby. Hush, lad,
you're not going anywhere.</i>

1092
01:31:47,077 --> 01:31:52,071
<i>You just sit here, nice and quiet,
next to me. That's right, right.</i>

1093
01:31:54,985 --> 01:31:57,647
How could you think
such a thing of Mr. Todd?

1094
01:31:57,754 --> 01:32:00,279
He's been so good to us.

1095
01:32:04,494 --> 01:32:11,024
<i>Nothing's gonna harm you
Not while I'm around</i>

1096
01:32:12,836 --> 01:32:18,331
<i>Nothing's gonna harm you, darling
Not while I'm around</i>

1097
01:32:19,609 --> 01:32:25,275
<i>Demons'll charm you with a smile
For a while</i>

1098
01:32:25,382 --> 01:32:28,510
<i>But in time</i>

1099
01:32:28,618 --> 01:32:32,611
<i>Nothing's gonna harm you</i>

1100
01:32:32,722 --> 01:32:38,354
<i>Not while I'm around</i>

1101
01:32:42,132 --> 01:32:45,101
Funny we should be having
this little chat right now.

1102
01:32:45,201 --> 01:32:47,396
'Cause I was just thinking...

1103
01:32:48,305 --> 01:32:50,933
You know how you've always fancied
coming into the bake house with me

1104
01:32:51,041 --> 01:32:54,169
<i>- to help make the pies?
- Yes, ma'am.</i>

1105
01:32:54,344 --> 01:32:58,678
<i>Well, no time like the present, eh?</i>

1106
01:33:18,568 --> 01:33:22,004
<i>I feel bad for you, going up
and down all these stairs.</i>

1107
01:33:22,105 --> 01:33:25,905
<i>- Well, that'll be your job now.
- Yes, ma'am.</i>

1108
01:33:30,347 --> 01:33:32,611
<i>Quite a stink, ain't there?</i>

1109
01:33:36,319 --> 01:33:37,650
You see those grates?

1110
01:33:37,754 --> 01:33:40,552
<i>They go right down to the sewers,
and the smells come up.</i>

1111
01:33:40,657 --> 01:33:43,057
Always a few rats gone home
to Jesus down there.

1112
01:33:43,159 --> 01:33:47,061
<i>Now, this'll be the bake oven.
Three dozen at a time.</i>

1113
01:33:47,163 --> 01:33:49,927
<i>Always be sure
the door is closed properly, like this.</i>

1114
01:33:50,033 --> 01:33:53,628
- Door's closed properly.
- This is a grinder.

1115
01:33:54,237 --> 01:33:57,570
Pop in the meat. Give it a good grind.

1116
01:34:00,877 --> 01:34:02,572
Pops out there.

1117
01:34:04,481 --> 01:34:05,846
You try.

1118
01:34:07,550 --> 01:34:08,778
Good grind.

1119
01:34:10,420 --> 01:34:12,149
Comes out there.

1120
01:34:14,157 --> 01:34:15,488
That's my boy.

1121
01:34:15,592 --> 01:34:18,425
<i>I'm just gonna pop upstairs,
back in two shakes, all right?</i>

1122
01:34:18,528 --> 01:34:21,759
You mind if I have a pie while I wait?

1123
01:34:21,865 --> 01:34:23,856
<i>As many as you like, son.</i>

1124
01:34:36,679 --> 01:34:38,044
<i>Yes, sir, I agree.</i>

1125
01:34:38,148 --> 01:34:39,615
It would be to our mutual interest

1126
01:34:39,716 --> 01:34:43,652
to come to some arrangement
in regard to my poor children's hair.

1127
01:34:43,753 --> 01:34:45,186
Brunettes.

1128
01:34:46,756 --> 01:34:48,246
Redheads.

1129
01:34:50,960 --> 01:34:53,428
I keep the blondes in here.

1130
01:34:53,530 --> 01:34:56,090
<i>It was yellow hair
you was looking for, sir?</i>

1131
01:34:56,199 --> 01:34:57,564
Yes.

1132
01:35:28,631 --> 01:35:32,658
<i>- That one there has the shade I need.
- Come, child.</i>

1133
01:35:39,409 --> 01:35:42,901
Smile for the gentleman
and you shall have a sweetie.

1134
01:35:44,914 --> 01:35:47,178
<i>Now, where shall I cut?</i>

1135
01:35:48,585 --> 01:35:51,952
<i>Not another word, Mr. Fogg,
or it will be your last.</i>

1136
01:35:53,890 --> 01:35:58,759
<i>Now, I leave you
to the mercy of your children.</i>

1137
01:36:09,172 --> 01:36:12,505
<i>I got him locked in.
But if he escapes, he'll go to the law.</i>

1138
01:36:12,609 --> 01:36:14,839
<i>- Then he won't escape.
- I don't know, Mr. Todd.</i>

1139
01:36:14,944 --> 01:36:17,208
The Judge'll be here soon.

1140
01:36:18,781 --> 01:36:21,614
<i>'Scuse me, sir. Gave me a fright.</i>

1141
01:36:21,718 --> 01:36:24,710
<i>Not my intention, good madam.
I assure you.</i>

1142
01:36:25,488 --> 01:36:28,480
Though I am here on official business.

1143
01:36:29,159 --> 01:36:34,426
<i>You see, there's been some complaints
about the stink from your chimney.</i>

1144
01:36:34,531 --> 01:36:37,557
They say at night
it is something most foul.

1145
01:36:38,434 --> 01:36:41,528
Health regulations
and the general public welfare

1146
01:36:41,638 --> 01:36:43,538
<i>naturally being my duty,</i>

1147
01:36:43,640 --> 01:36:46,768
I'm afraid I'm gonna have to take a look

1148
01:36:49,646 --> 01:36:51,341
at your bakehouse.

1149
01:36:52,749 --> 01:36:54,239
<i>Of course, sir.</i>

1150
01:36:54,350 --> 01:36:58,013
<i>But first, why don't you come upstairs?
Let me pamper you.</i>

1151
01:36:59,789 --> 01:37:02,724
Much as I do appreciate
tonsorial doormen

1152
01:37:02,825 --> 01:37:05,293
I really ought to see
to my official obligations first.

1153
01:37:05,395 --> 01:37:07,386
I completely understand.

1154
01:37:10,767 --> 01:37:15,329
<i>If you'll indulge me, sir,
what is that exotic aroma?</i>

1155
01:37:18,308 --> 01:37:21,334
<i>Me secret, is a touch of ambergris.</i>

1156
01:37:22,712 --> 01:37:25,374
Dare I offer you something
a tad more appropriate

1157
01:37:25,481 --> 01:37:27,881
for a gentleman of your standing?

1158
01:37:27,984 --> 01:37:30,919
<i>The ladies will greatly appreciate it, sir.</i>

1159
01:37:33,790 --> 01:37:37,055
You're the expert in these matters.

1160
01:37:37,160 --> 01:37:39,094
Only take a moment.

1161
01:37:43,233 --> 01:37:45,724
<i>Would you like a bit of bay rum, sir?</i>

1162
01:37:45,835 --> 01:37:48,099
Bay rum is very bracing.

1163
01:38:53,936 --> 01:38:57,565
<i>Let me out! Please, let me out!</i>

1164
01:39:00,343 --> 01:39:01,970
Let me out!

1165
01:39:19,629 --> 01:39:20,789
Toby?

1166
01:39:22,598 --> 01:39:24,156
Where is he?

1167
01:39:28,271 --> 01:39:33,140
<i>Toby, where are you, love?</i>

1168
01:39:35,244 --> 01:39:36,506
Toby?

1169
01:39:40,483 --> 01:39:44,112
<i>Nothing's gonna harm you</i>

1170
01:39:44,220 --> 01:39:47,451
<i>Not while I'm around</i>

1171
01:39:47,557 --> 01:39:48,819
Toby?

1172
01:39:50,660 --> 01:39:52,924
<i>Where are you hiding?</i>

1173
01:39:54,464 --> 01:39:55,624
Toby?

1174
01:39:56,833 --> 01:40:00,030
<i>Nothing's gonna harm you, darling</i>

1175
01:40:02,538 --> 01:40:05,132
<i>Not while I'm around</i>

1176
01:40:09,178 --> 01:40:10,440
Toby?

1177
01:40:12,582 --> 01:40:14,015
Mr. Todd!

1178
01:40:16,052 --> 01:40:17,644
You wait for him here.

1179
01:40:17,754 --> 01:40:21,246
I'll return with a coach
in less than half an hour.

1180
01:40:21,357 --> 01:40:25,817
Don't worry. No one'll recognize you.
You're safe now.

1181
01:40:26,829 --> 01:40:31,664
<i>Safe? So, we run away
and then all our dreams come true?</i>

1182
01:40:32,769 --> 01:40:34,430
I hope so.

1183
01:40:35,238 --> 01:40:38,435
I've never had dreams. Only nightmares.

1184
01:40:39,442 --> 01:40:40,841
<i>Johanna,</i>

1185
01:40:41,577 --> 01:40:45,035
when we're free of this place
all the ghosts will go away.

1186
01:40:45,148 --> 01:40:48,584
<i>No, Anthony. They never go away.</i>

1187
01:40:49,652 --> 01:40:53,383
I'll be right back to you.
Half an hour and we'll be free.

1188
01:41:28,825 --> 01:41:31,453
<i>Beadle! Beadle!</i>

1189
01:41:32,662 --> 01:41:37,429
<i>No good hiding, I saw you</i>

1190
01:41:37,533 --> 01:41:42,493
<i>Are you in there still, Beadle?
Beadle?</i>

1191
01:41:42,605 --> 01:41:45,403
<i>Beadle, dear Beadle?</i>

1192
01:41:47,543 --> 01:41:50,671
<i>Beadle deedle deedle
deedle deedle dumpling</i>

1193
01:41:50,780 --> 01:41:52,975
<i>Beadle dumpling...</i>

1194
01:41:59,989 --> 01:42:03,015
Who are you?
What are you doing here?

1195
01:42:05,261 --> 01:42:06,751
<i>Evil is here, sir.</i>

1196
01:42:06,863 --> 01:42:11,459
<i>The stink of evil, from below, from her!
Oh, she's the Devil's wife.</i>

1197
01:42:11,567 --> 01:42:15,560
<i>Beware her, sir.
She with no pity in her heart.</i>

1198
01:42:17,573 --> 01:42:20,440
<i>Don't I know you, mister?</i>

1199
01:42:20,543 --> 01:42:22,010
Mr. Todd?

1200
01:42:33,456 --> 01:42:34,980
Where is she?

1201
01:42:36,425 --> 01:42:39,019
<i>Below, Your Honor. With my neighbor.</i>

1202
01:42:40,029 --> 01:42:43,590
Thank heavens
the sailor did not molest her.

1203
01:42:43,699 --> 01:42:48,261
<i>Thank heavens, too,
she has seen the error of her ways.</i>

1204
01:42:49,138 --> 01:42:51,402
<i>- She has?
- Oh, yes.</i>

1205
01:42:52,275 --> 01:42:54,573
Your lesson was well-learned.

1206
01:42:54,677 --> 01:42:58,773
She speaks only of you.
Longing for forgiveness.

1207
01:43:00,583 --> 01:43:02,744
Then she shall have it.

1208
01:43:03,819 --> 01:43:07,186
<i>- She'll be here soon, you say?
- Yes.</i>

1209
01:43:07,790 --> 01:43:09,758
<i>Excellent, my friend.</i>

1210
01:43:11,761 --> 01:43:13,422
How about a shave?

1211
01:43:14,830 --> 01:43:16,764
<i>Sit, sir. Sit.</i>

1212
01:43:19,769 --> 01:43:25,799
<i>- Oh, pretty women
- Pretty women, yes</i>

1213
01:43:25,908 --> 01:43:28,968
<i>Johanna, Johanna</i>

1214
01:43:29,078 --> 01:43:32,673
<i>Pretty women
Pretty women are a wonder</i>

1215
01:43:32,782 --> 01:43:34,374
<i>Pretty women!</i>

1216
01:43:34,483 --> 01:43:37,384
<i>What we do for pretty women!</i>

1217
01:43:37,486 --> 01:43:41,149
<i>- Blowing out their candles
- Blowing out their candles</i>

1218
01:43:41,257 --> 01:43:44,852
<i>- Or combing out their hair
- Or combing out their hair</i>

1219
01:43:44,961 --> 01:43:46,656
<i>Then they leave</i>

1220
01:43:46,762 --> 01:43:50,323
<i>- Even when they leave
- Even when they leave you and vanish</i>

1221
01:43:50,433 --> 01:43:53,334
<i>- They still are there
- They somehow can still remain</i>

1222
01:43:53,436 --> 01:43:58,373
<i>- There with you, there
- They're there</i>

1223
01:43:59,175 --> 01:44:02,770
How seldom it is
one meets a fellow spirit.

1224
01:44:02,878 --> 01:44:07,116
<i>With fellow tastes in women, at least.</i>

1225
01:44:07,950 --> 01:44:09,417
What's that?

1226
01:44:10,319 --> 01:44:13,220
<i>The years, no doubt,
have changed me, sir.</i>

1227
01:44:13,322 --> 01:44:16,223
<i>But then, I suppose the face of a barber,</i>

1228
01:44:16,325 --> 01:44:20,386
<i>the face of a prisoner,
a dog, is not particularly memorable.</i>

1229
01:44:27,136 --> 01:44:29,570
Benjamin Barker.

1230
01:44:29,905 --> 01:44:32,738
Benjamin Barker!

1231
01:45:10,579 --> 01:45:14,037
<i>Rest now, my friend</i>

1232
01:45:16,185 --> 01:45:20,417
<i>Rest now forever</i>

1233
01:45:21,891 --> 01:45:27,158
<i>Sleep now the untroubled</i>

1234
01:45:27,263 --> 01:45:32,826
<i>Sleep of the angels</i>

1235
01:45:44,013 --> 01:45:46,106
<i>Come for a shave, have you, lad?</i>

1236
01:45:46,215 --> 01:45:47,807
<i>No, I...</i>

1237
01:45:51,687 --> 01:45:54,451
Everyone needs a good shave.

1238
01:46:01,664 --> 01:46:03,723
Forget my face.

1239
01:46:07,570 --> 01:46:10,801
<i>Die! God in heaven, die!</i>

1240
01:46:24,653 --> 01:46:26,143
You.

1241
01:46:35,097 --> 01:46:36,894
Why did you scream?

1242
01:46:36,999 --> 01:46:39,968
<i>He was clutching onto me dress,
but he's finished now.</i>

1243
01:46:40,069 --> 01:46:42,503
I'll take care of it. Open the door.

1244
01:46:42,605 --> 01:46:44,903
<i>Open the door, I said.</i>

1245
01:47:39,094 --> 01:47:41,756
"Don't I know you?" she said.

1246
01:47:51,507 --> 01:47:53,338
You knew she lived.

1247
01:47:55,311 --> 01:47:57,575
I was only thinking of you.

1248
01:48:01,183 --> 01:48:03,151
You lied to me.

1249
01:48:03,252 --> 01:48:06,813
<i>No, no, not lied at all
No, I never lied</i>

1250
01:48:06,922 --> 01:48:08,583
<i>- Lucy...
- Said she took a poison</i>

1251
01:48:08,691 --> 01:48:10,591
<i>she did, never said that she died</i>

1252
01:48:10,693 --> 01:48:12,888
<i>- I've come home again
- Poor thing, she lived</i>

1253
01:48:12,995 --> 01:48:14,257
<i>But it left her weak in the head</i>

1254
01:48:14,363 --> 01:48:16,831
<i>All she did for months
was just lie there in bed</i>

1255
01:48:16,932 --> 01:48:18,297
<i>Should've been in hospital</i>

1256
01:48:18,400 --> 01:48:21,130
<i>Wound up in Bedlam instead
Poor thing!</i>

1257
01:48:21,237 --> 01:48:23,467
<i>- Better you should think she was dead
- Oh, my God!</i>

1258
01:48:23,572 --> 01:48:26,439
<i>Yes, I lied 'cause I love you!</i>

1259
01:48:26,542 --> 01:48:29,272
<i>- I'd be twice the wife she was!
- Lucy...</i>

1260
01:48:29,378 --> 01:48:31,676
<i>- I love you!
- What have I done?</i>

1261
01:48:31,780 --> 01:48:34,977
<i>Could that thing have
cared for you like me?</i>

1262
01:48:35,084 --> 01:48:38,144
<i>Mrs. Lovett, you're a bloody wonder
Eminently practical</i>

1263
01:48:38,254 --> 01:48:41,018
<i>And yet appropriate as always
As you've said repeatedly</i>

1264
01:48:41,123 --> 01:48:42,784
<i>There's little point in dwelling
on the past</i>

1265
01:48:42,892 --> 01:48:43,859
<i>- Now, come here, my love...
- Do you mean it?</i>

1266
01:48:43,959 --> 01:48:45,187
<i>Everything I did, I swear, I thought</i>

1267
01:48:45,294 --> 01:48:46,522
<i>- was only for the best
- Not a thing to fear</i>

1268
01:48:46,662 --> 01:48:50,189
<i>- my love, what's dead Is dead
- Can we still be married?</i>

1269
01:48:50,299 --> 01:48:53,268
<i>The history of the world, my pet</i>

1270
01:48:53,369 --> 01:48:56,497
<i>Oh, Mr. Todd, oh, Mr. Todd
Leave it to me</i>

1271
01:48:56,605 --> 01:48:59,870
<i>Is learn forgiveness and try to forget</i>

1272
01:48:59,975 --> 01:49:01,636
<i>By the sea, Mr. Todd
We'll be comfy-cozy</i>

1273
01:49:01,744 --> 01:49:03,405
<i>By the sea, Mr. Todd
Where there's no one nosy</i>

1274
01:49:03,512 --> 01:49:08,779
<i>And life is for the alive, my dear
So let's keep living it</i>

1275
01:49:08,884 --> 01:49:13,685
<i>- Just keep living it, really living it!
- Just keep living it, really living it!</i>

1276
01:50:00,169 --> 01:50:04,230
<i>There was a barber and his wife</i>

1277
01:50:05,607 --> 01:50:10,010
<i>And she was beautiful</i>

1278
01:50:12,581 --> 01:50:16,881
<i>A foolish barber and his wife</i>

1279
01:50:17,786 --> 01:50:22,189
<i>She was his reason and his life</i>

1280
01:50:22,992 --> 01:50:27,395
<i>And she was beautiful</i>

1281
01:50:28,163 --> 01:50:32,725
<i>And she was virtuous</i>

1282
01:50:34,970 --> 01:50:38,201
<i>And he was...</i>
