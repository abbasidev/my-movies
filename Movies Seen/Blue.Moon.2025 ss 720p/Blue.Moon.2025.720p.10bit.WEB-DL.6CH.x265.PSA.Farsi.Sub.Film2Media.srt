of one of America's
foremost songwriters,

13
00:01:48,066 --> 00:01:50,360
Lorenz Hart,
who died last night

14
00:01:50,443 --> 00:01:52,278
at Doctors Hospital
in Manhattan

15
00:01:52,362 --> 00:01:54,364

Mr. Hart was 48 years old.

For over 20 years, Hart and
his partner, Richard Rodgers,

18
00:02:01,287 --> 00:02:03,915
Rodgers wrote the music,
Hart the words,

19
00:02:03,998 --> 00:02:06,167
combined their
respective geniuses

20
00:02:06,251 --> 00:02:09,170
to create a string
of musical-comedy hits.

21
00:02:09,254 --> 00:02:12,549
Often referred to as America's
Gilbert and Sullivan,

22

Worst line in Casablanca?

Do they even speak English

57
00:04:32,647 --> 00:04:35,149
Still, you have
to love Claude Rains.

58
00:04:35,233 --> 00:04:38,528
-He makes that picture.
-Sure.

59
00:04:38,611 --> 00:04:39,862
You know
why he's so great?

60
00:04:39,946 --> 00:04:42,573
He's a leading man,
and he's short,

61
00:04:42,657 --> 00:04:45,076
which proves you can be both.

62
00:04:45,159 --> 00:04:46,452
And I love this.

63
00:04:46,536 --> 00:04:48,413
He says to Ilsa,

64
00:04:48,496 --> 00:04:53,293
"Mademoiselle, he's the kind
of man that, if I were a woman

65
00:04:53,376 --> 00:04:56,212
"and I were not around,
I should be in love with Rick."

66
00:04:56,296 --> 00:04:58,214
Think about it.

67
00:04:58,298 --> 00:05:00,800

at the end of the picture?

68
00:05:00,883 --> 00:05:04,554
Who's strolling away together
arm in arm into the fog?

69
00:05:04,637 --> 00:05:06,264
You're saying Rick
and Captain Renault...

70
00:05:06,347 --> 00:05:07,682
What do you think goes on
over there

71
00:05:07,765 --> 00:05:10,018
at the Free French garrison
in Brazzaville?

72
00:05:10,101 --> 00:05:12,687
That is a scene
they can't show you.

73
00:05:12,770 --> 00:05:15,273
Okay. Best line in Casablanca?

74
00:05:17,817 --> 00:05:19,986
"Nobody ever
loved me that much."

75
00:05:20,069 --> 00:05:21,738
Isn't that magnificent?

76
00:05:21,821 --> 00:05:25,074
Six words. "Nobody ever loved me
that much."

77
00:05:25,158 --> 00:05:27,243
And, really,
who's ever been loved enough?

78
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:28,661
Who's ever been loved
half enough?

79
00:05:28,745 --> 00:05:29,704
Would you get me a shot?

80
00:05:31,247 --> 00:05:32,206
Larry, you told me
under no circumstances...

81
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:33,541
I'm just going to look at it.

82
00:05:33,624 --> 00:05:34,584
Take the measure

83
00:05:34,667 --> 00:05:36,961
of its amber heft in my hand.

84
00:05:37,045 --> 00:05:39,464
-You told me not...
-Just give me the drink.

85
00:05:45,011 --> 00:05:46,721
Did I tell you
what Elizabeth told me?

86
00:05:46,804 --> 00:05:48,639
That's the girl
I'm meeting here tonight.

87
00:05:48,723 --> 00:05:50,475
-You mean the one you...
-Eddie, Eddie, Eddie.

88
00:05:50,558 --> 00:05:53,936
-What?
-Show some class, all right?

89
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:56,147
Her mother is going to come
walking in here any second.

90
00:05:56,230 --> 00:05:57,982
-Sorry.
-Seriously.

91
00:05:58,066 --> 00:06:00,485
I... I adore this girl.

92
00:06:00,568 --> 00:06:02,612
And, I'm telling you,
this is beyond sex.

93
00:06:02,695 --> 00:06:04,864
-What's beyond sex?
-I don't understand it.

94
00:06:04,947 --> 00:06:06,824
She's completely undeserving,

95
00:06:06,908 --> 00:06:09,035
but isn't that the way
it always is?

96
00:06:09,118 --> 00:06:10,578
"Irrational adoration."

97
00:06:10,661 --> 00:06:11,996
That's the phrase
she came up with.

98
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:13,873
She's a poet, too.
Did I tell you that?

99
00:06:13,956 --> 00:06:16,459
Oh, and would you give me
a shot of club soda?

100
00:06:16,542 --> 00:06:20,254
I'll drink one
and admire the other.

101
00:06:20,922 --> 00:06:22,423
So, this girl...

102
00:06:24,425 --> 00:06:27,720
You really, you know,

103
00:06:27,804 --> 00:06:30,139
with a 20-year-old
college girl, huh?

104
00:06:30,223 --> 00:06:33,101
It is more complicated
than you could possibly imagine.

105
00:06:33,184 --> 00:06:35,061
Uh, leave the bottle.

106
00:06:35,144 --> 00:06:37,105
It's a visual poem.

107
00:06:37,188 --> 00:06:38,898
You're not giving me
any details here.

108
00:06:38,981 --> 00:06:41,109
You know what my secret goal is
for the rest of this year?

109
00:06:41,192 --> 00:06:42,777
-What?
-I'm serious. Really.

110
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:47,115
My secret goal
is to stop being so scared.

111
00:06:47,198 --> 00:06:50,034
-Elizabeth Weiland. For...
-Those are mine!

112
00:06:50,118 --> 00:06:53,454
Jesus! That is all you get
for five dollars?

113
00:06:53,538 --> 00:06:55,039
Plus delivery, yes.

114
00:06:56,999 --> 00:06:58,668
Lorenz Hart?

115
00:06:58,751 --> 00:07:01,629
You know, I kind of think
I've heard that name before.

116
00:07:01,712 --> 00:07:05,508
You just earned yourself
a dollar tip, kid.

117
00:07:05,591 --> 00:07:07,885
A precedent is being broken.

118
00:07:09,429 --> 00:07:11,889
Hey, she gave this to me.

119
00:07:11,973 --> 00:07:13,891
Mailed it all the way
from New Haven

120
00:07:13,975 --> 00:07:15,101
because I said
I wanted something

121
00:07:15,184 --> 00:07:16,519
she'd actually touched.

122
00:07:16,602 --> 00:07:19,105
Christ! It's like
I'm 17 again,

123
00:07:19,188 --> 00:07:20,606
except I never was 17.

124
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:23,192
I went directly from childhood
to washed-up.

125
00:07:24,569 --> 00:07:26,612
Eddie, get the kid a drink,
would you?

126
00:07:26,696 --> 00:07:28,364
No thanks. I'm... I'm working.

127
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:30,575
Oh, Christ, that's when
you should be drinking.

128
00:07:30,658 --> 00:07:32,577
What's your name?
Sven, am I right?

129
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:35,371
-Troy.
-Ooh, even better.

130
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:37,373
Listen, Sven,
are you free tonight?

131
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:39,292
Eddie, would you get the kid
a goddamn shot?

132
00:07:39,375 --> 00:07:40,334
-Yeah.
-'Cause I am throwing

133

143
00:08:03,691 --> 00:08:05,568

I want you at my party, Sven!

177
00:09:34,865 --> 00:09:36,909
Doc Bender said to me
the other night,

178
00:09:36,993 --> 00:09:39,704
after I told him I'd proposed
to Vivienne again,

179
00:09:39,787 --> 00:09:42,081
"She turned me down, again,"

180
00:09:42,164 --> 00:09:44,792
he said...
"Larry, make up your mind.

181
00:09:44,875 --> 00:09:47,211
"Are you homosexual
or heterosexual?"

182
00:09:47,295 --> 00:09:49,505
I said, "Doc, I'm ambisexual."

183
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:51,299
He said... "What
the hell does that even mean?"

184
00:09:51,382 --> 00:09:53,009
I said,
"It means I can jerk off

185
00:09:53,092 --> 00:09:54,719
"equally well with either hand."

186
00:09:54,802 --> 00:09:57,054
Oh, Larry!
There's a lady present.

187
00:09:57,138 --> 00:09:59,599
Well, women
can use either hand, too.

188
00:10:00,808 --> 00:10:02,435
But to be a writer,
you have to be

189
00:10:02,518 --> 00:10:04,645
kind of omni-sexual, don't you?

190
00:10:04,729 --> 00:10:06,814
You have to have,
inside yourself,

191
00:10:06,897 --> 00:10:08,482
you know, everyone on earth.

192
00:10:08,566 --> 00:10:10,526
Men, women, horses.

193
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:14,196
How can you give voice
to the whole chorus of the world

194
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:17,783
if the whole chorus of the world
isn't already inside you?

195
00:10:20,411 --> 00:10:23,289
Eddie, what do you call
a tireless,

196
00:10:23,372 --> 00:10:25,708
relentless homosexual?

197
00:10:25,791 --> 00:10:27,918
"Indefagitable."

198
00:10:30,129 --> 00:10:34,759
To the great and glorious past,
when it all mattered so much.

199
00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:37,428
Mmm.

200
00:10:37,511 --> 00:10:39,722
Keep playing. You're good.

201
00:10:39,805 --> 00:10:42,266
Oh, thank you.
I'm an aspiring composer.

202
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:43,684
"Aspiring"?

203
00:10:43,768 --> 00:10:45,102
That means you're breathing,
right?

204
00:10:45,186 --> 00:10:46,896
Mmm.

205
00:10:46,979 --> 00:10:49,190
I better take your name down
in case I need a new partner.

206
00:10:49,273 --> 00:10:52,026
Hey, did you go
to the opening tonight?

207
00:10:52,109 --> 00:10:55,738
Oklahoma! With an exclamation
point, no less.

208
00:10:55,821 --> 00:10:57,740
Fact. Any title
that feels the need

209
00:10:57,823 --> 00:10:59,116
for an exclamation point,

210
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,660
you want to steer clear of.

211
00:11:02,828 --> 00:11:04,497
What did you say
your name was again?

212
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:07,750
Uh, Morty Rifkin. But I go
by the name of Morty Rafferty.

213
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:10,044
No one could possibly
guess you're Jewish.

214
00:11:17,927 --> 00:11:19,011
Wha'dja think
of Oklahoma?

215
00:11:20,596 --> 00:11:23,307
What did I think of Oklahoma?

216
00:11:24,183 --> 00:11:26,519
Well, Knuckles,

217
00:11:26,602 --> 00:11:28,562
Knuckles O'Rifkin,

218
00:11:28,646 --> 00:11:30,731
that's what I'm going
to call you,

219
00:11:30,815 --> 00:11:33,567
I saw the show a couple of times
in previews in New Haven,

220
00:11:33,651 --> 00:11:34,735
back when
they were still calling it

221
00:11:34,819 --> 00:11:37,613
Away We Go! Exclamation point.

222
00:11:37,697 --> 00:11:41,325
And I felt sure Dick
was gonna call me,

223
00:11:41,409 --> 00:11:43,994
"Larry, we're in big trouble.

224
00:11:44,078 --> 00:11:45,830
"I need you
to funny up the show.

225
00:11:45,913 --> 00:11:47,581
"We need some
big comedy numbers."

226
00:11:47,665 --> 00:11:49,166
And I was all ready to say,

227
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:53,629
"Dick, instead of all this
corn-pone Americana,

228
00:11:53,713 --> 00:11:56,882
"let's do a send-up
of corn-pone Americana!"

229
00:11:56,966 --> 00:11:59,593
I was already writing lyrics
in my head. I couldn't stop.

230
00:11:59,677 --> 00:12:00,928
And did he call you?

231
00:12:01,011 --> 00:12:02,388
Are you kidding?
He was too busy

232
00:12:02,471 --> 00:12:03,806
writing more hits. Huh.

233
00:12:05,766 --> 00:12:08,519
I sat in my box seat tonight
and watched

234
00:12:08,602 --> 00:12:10,146
"Oklahomo,

235
00:12:10,229 --> 00:12:11,647
"exclamation point"...

236
00:12:11,731 --> 00:12:14,108
...down there, glittering
in all its pink lights

237
00:12:14,191 --> 00:12:17,403
and all those cowboy hats
and twirling lassos,

238
00:12:17,486 --> 00:12:21,949
and I knew two things
with absolute certainty.

239
00:12:22,032 --> 00:12:23,826
It was a 14-karat hit

240
00:12:23,909 --> 00:12:27,246
and it was a 14-karat
piece of shit.

241
00:12:27,329 --> 00:12:29,749
Oh. Friend of mine
saw it in previews,

242
00:12:29,832 --> 00:12:32,042
said it was one of
the best shows he's ever seen.

243
00:12:32,126 --> 00:12:35,963
The show is fraudulent
on every possible level.

244
00:12:36,046 --> 00:12:38,257
And this is not
jealousy speaking, okay?

245
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:41,260
I watched that show tonight

246
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:44,847
and I felt this great sinking
in my heart.

247
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:47,516
And all around me people
are roaring.

248
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:50,019
They are roaring
at third-rate jokes.

249
00:12:50,102 --> 00:12:52,938
I wanted to grab the audience
by the shoulders and say,

250
00:12:53,022 --> 00:12:56,776
"What are you laughing at?
Come on! Demand more!" And...

251
00:12:57,902 --> 00:12:59,987
Rodgers is a genius.

252
00:13:00,070 --> 00:13:02,656
I say that without
one second's hesitation.

253
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:04,283
You're a piano player.
You know that I'm right.

254
00:13:04,366 --> 00:13:05,367
Yeah, he's pretty good.

255
00:13:06,035 --> 00:13:07,495
Pretty good?

256
00:13:07,578 --> 00:13:11,957
There is no one with his range,
his inventiveness,

257
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:17,505
great soaring masculine melodies
building like pile drivers.

258
00:13:17,588 --> 00:13:19,840
I mean, Rodgers is
a cold-hearted son of a bitch,

259
00:13:19,924 --> 00:13:21,592
but he can get a melody
to levitate,

260
00:13:21,675 --> 00:13:26,263
and that is the hallmark
of great art, levitation.

261
00:13:26,347 --> 00:13:31,644
♪ I've got
a beautiful feeling ♪

262
00:13:31,727 --> 00:13:33,813
That's the moment.
You hear that?

263
00:13:34,605 --> 00:13:35,981
When your spine glows

264
00:13:36,065 --> 00:13:38,234
and the whole apparatus
of songwriting

265
00:13:38,317 --> 00:13:40,444
suddenly breaks free
from gravity.

266
00:13:40,528 --> 00:13:43,322
There's maybe five people
on the planet

267
00:13:43,405 --> 00:13:44,532
that can pull that off,

268
00:13:44,615 --> 00:13:47,701
and that son of a bitch
is one of 'em.

269
00:13:47,785 --> 00:13:53,290
And then, oy...
Words by Oscar Hammerstein II.

270
00:13:54,834 --> 00:13:56,794
What can I say about Oscar?

271
00:13:56,877 --> 00:13:59,129
He's going to come striding
in here any second,

272
00:13:59,213 --> 00:14:00,548
all seven
and a half feet of him,

273
00:14:00,631 --> 00:14:01,882
and, you know, Dick deliberately

274
00:14:01,966 --> 00:14:03,300
went with somebody tall
this time,

275
00:14:03,384 --> 00:14:05,135
you know that.

276
00:14:05,219 --> 00:14:06,637
But what can I say about Oscar?

277
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:10,307
He's so earthbound,

278
00:14:10,391 --> 00:14:13,727
and let's face it,
most of us are earthbound.

279
00:14:13,811 --> 00:14:16,146
But there are moments,
I swear to God,

280
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:18,274
there are moments in my work

281
00:14:18,357 --> 00:14:20,484
when I have made something
bigger than myself.

282
00:14:20,568 --> 00:14:22,111
I agree, definitely.

283
00:14:22,194 --> 00:14:25,114
Thank you. The words were bigger
than the music,

284
00:14:25,197 --> 00:14:26,740
bigger than the characters
who sang them,

285
00:14:26,824 --> 00:14:28,325
and they approached, for maybe

286
00:14:28,409 --> 00:14:31,370
one-half second,
something immortal.

287
00:14:31,453 --> 00:14:34,498
Excuse my limitless self-regard,
but they did,

288
00:14:34,582 --> 00:14:37,376
and if nobody else is going
to say it, then I'm going to.

289
00:14:37,459 --> 00:14:39,044
I have written
a handful of words

290
00:14:39,128 --> 00:14:40,796
that are going to cheat death.

291
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:43,340
Spoken with the modesty
of a true lunatic.

292
00:14:43,424 --> 00:14:45,593
Hey! When Shakespeare wrote,

293
00:14:45,676 --> 00:14:47,970
"Not marble nor gilded monuments

294
00:14:48,053 --> 00:14:50,723
"Of princes shall outlive
this powerful rhyme,"

295
00:14:50,806 --> 00:14:53,225
did people say,
"My God, what an ego"?

296
00:14:53,309 --> 00:14:55,436
No, they said he is a genius,

297
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:57,771
and he knows his work
is going to last.

298
00:14:57,855 --> 00:14:59,565
So now you're Shakespeare?

299
00:14:59,648 --> 00:15:01,400
Look, Oklahoma! is going to win
the goddamn Pulitzer.

300
00:15:01,483 --> 00:15:02,776
I know that.

301
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:03,694
High schools
are going to put it on

302
00:15:03,777 --> 00:15:04,987
from now till doomsday,

303
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:08,073
because it is so inoffensive.

304
00:15:08,157 --> 00:15:11,118
But really,
who wants inoffensive art?

305
00:15:11,201 --> 00:15:12,411
Knuckles...

306
00:15:12,494 --> 00:15:13,704
...are you listening to me?

307
00:15:13,787 --> 00:15:15,039
I'm trying to answer
your question.

308
00:15:15,122 --> 00:15:16,248
Is that why God put us
on the planet,

309
00:15:16,332 --> 00:15:17,750
to not offend people?

310
00:15:17,833 --> 00:15:18,876
The problem

311
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:20,544
with Oklahoma! is this,

312
00:15:20,628 --> 00:15:23,547
and the problem was right there
in the original play,

313
00:15:23,631 --> 00:15:25,299
Green Grow the Fucking Lilacs.

314
00:15:25,382 --> 00:15:27,968
And Dick first showed that play
to me, all right?

315
00:15:28,052 --> 00:15:30,346
He asked me to adapt it first,
and I said no,

316
00:15:30,429 --> 00:15:32,139
and I don't mind
that it's nostalgic,

317
00:15:32,222 --> 00:15:34,183
but Oklahoma!,
exclamation point,

318
00:15:34,266 --> 00:15:37,436
is nostalgic for a world
that never existed,

319
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:40,147
and do you really
want to write a show

320
00:15:40,230 --> 00:15:42,566
where the main character's name
is Curly?

321
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:45,235
Oh, here's an idea for a song.

322
00:15:45,319 --> 00:15:47,446
"Hey, Moe! Hey, Larry!
I Just Stepped in Cow Shit!"

323
00:15:51,075 --> 00:15:52,952
I mean, am I bitter?

324
00:15:54,870 --> 00:15:57,915
We write together
for a quarter a century,

325
00:15:57,998 --> 00:16:01,043
and the first show
he writes with someone else

326
00:16:01,126 --> 00:16:03,963
is gonna be the biggest hit
he ever had. Am I bitter?

327
00:16:04,046 --> 00:16:05,881
-Larry...
-Fuck yes.

328
00:16:05,965 --> 00:16:09,510
But I need
to tell you about Elizabeth.

329
00:16:09,593 --> 00:16:10,844
I need to cleanse my heart.

330
00:16:10,928 --> 00:16:12,471
Here we go. The 20-year-old...

331
00:16:12,554 --> 00:16:15,224
She's going to come
in here any second.

332
00:16:15,307 --> 00:16:17,309
Uh, Rodgers is gonna
be here tonight, right?

333
00:16:17,393 --> 00:16:18,769
Don't worry,

334
00:16:18,852 --> 00:16:20,562
-I'll introduce you.
-Oh, that'd be great.

335
00:16:20,646 --> 00:16:22,189
I'm trying to get somebody
to listen to my songs.

336
00:16:22,272 --> 00:16:24,650
Well, listen and learn.

337
00:16:24,733 --> 00:16:27,778
I'm telling you about Elizabeth.

338
00:16:28,904 --> 00:16:30,990
There's something appealingly...

339
00:16:31,907 --> 00:16:34,159
ethereal about her face.

340
00:16:34,243 --> 00:16:35,577
What the fuck does that mean?

341
00:16:35,661 --> 00:16:38,205
Look, I got her
all these presents.

342
00:16:38,288 --> 00:16:40,457
You bought her
something from Klein's?

343
00:16:40,541 --> 00:16:42,418
She's gonna love this.

344
00:16:42,501 --> 00:16:43,919
Yeah, but that's used shit.
What are you doing?

345
00:16:44,003 --> 00:16:45,212
This is an authentic
first-edition.

346
00:16:45,295 --> 00:16:47,089
You don't understand the magic

347
00:16:47,172 --> 00:16:48,549
and the mystery of this girl.

348
00:16:48,632 --> 00:16:52,136
"I have been waiting for this
my whole life."

349
00:16:52,219 --> 00:16:53,429
It's what Somerset Maugham

350
00:16:53,512 --> 00:16:54,847
says in that thing,
you remember?

351
00:16:56,765 --> 00:16:57,766
-Me?
-Yeah.

352
00:16:57,850 --> 00:16:59,768
"There's always one who loves

353
00:16:59,852 --> 00:17:01,478
"and one who lets himself
be loved."

354
00:17:02,771 --> 00:17:04,023
That's the truth, isn't it?

355
00:17:04,106 --> 00:17:05,441
Of course,
you know you're in trouble

356
00:17:05,524 --> 00:17:06,859
when you're looking
for the meaning of life

357
00:17:06,942 --> 00:17:09,028
in a book with the word
"bondage" in the title.

358
00:17:10,571 --> 00:17:11,905
Larry...

359
00:17:14,783 --> 00:17:16,535
She's a girl. Right?

360
00:17:16,618 --> 00:17:18,287
Okay. See, I always thought

361
00:17:18,370 --> 00:17:20,456
that your interests
went more towards...

362
00:17:20,539 --> 00:17:21,498
My interests?

363
00:17:22,958 --> 00:17:25,252
So now you're going
to analyze me?

364
00:17:25,335 --> 00:17:28,172
Thank you, Doctor Bacardi.

365
00:17:28,255 --> 00:17:30,549
Look, I met her at rehearsals
for By Jupiter.

366
00:17:30,632 --> 00:17:31,884
And she's not an actress.

367
00:17:31,967 --> 00:17:34,636
She's a college student.
Sophomore.

368
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:37,639
Yale. Not the general school,
that's for the guys.

369
00:17:37,723 --> 00:17:40,934
This is the School of Fine Arts!

370
00:17:41,018 --> 00:17:44,354
Bohemian goddessesy
in gray smocks

371
00:17:44,438 --> 00:17:47,858
mixing paint in morning light.

372
00:17:47,941 --> 00:17:49,818
She's all of 20 years old.

373
00:17:50,402 --> 00:17:51,570
And you're what?

374
00:17:51,653 --> 00:17:53,197
A youthful 47!

375
00:17:55,365 --> 00:17:57,159
You know what I call her
in my letters?

376
00:17:57,242 --> 00:18:00,329
"My irreplaceable Elizabeth!"
Can you believe it?

377
00:18:00,412 --> 00:18:03,123
If I could write what's
in my heart this second,

378
00:18:03,207 --> 00:18:06,043
I would have the entire audience
levitating.

379
00:18:06,126 --> 00:18:08,170
Oklahoma! would close in shame

380
00:18:08,253 --> 00:18:10,923
if it could hear eight bars
of what's in my heart.

381
00:18:11,006 --> 00:18:12,132
And I've been
in eight bars tonight,

382
00:18:12,216 --> 00:18:13,092
so I know
what I'm talking about.

383
00:18:13,175 --> 00:18:15,177
Go!

384
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:16,762
Last summer,
I found myself awake

385
00:18:16,845 --> 00:18:18,430
at 4:30 in the morning.

386
00:18:18,514 --> 00:18:20,474
And all I had done
the previous five hours...

387
00:18:20,557 --> 00:18:23,393
What the hell are you lookin'
at your watch for?

388
00:18:23,477 --> 00:18:24,686
Larry, I'm working here.

389
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:26,522
What the hell
do you think I'm doing?

390
00:18:26,605 --> 00:18:28,357
And I'm not even getting paid.
All right.

391
00:18:32,069 --> 00:18:33,320
More flowers...

392
00:18:33,403 --> 00:18:34,780
Oh. Eddie,
get Sven another drink!

393
00:18:34,863 --> 00:18:36,323
...for Richard Rodgers.

394
00:18:36,406 --> 00:18:38,492
Jesus, how much did those cost?

395
00:18:38,575 --> 00:18:40,994
Sixteen dollars. Plus delivery.

396
00:18:42,704 --> 00:18:44,498
"Dick, I've got
a beautiful feeling,

397
00:18:44,581 --> 00:18:45,707
"everything's going your way.

398
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:47,126
"Love, Dorothy."

399
00:18:47,209 --> 00:18:48,752
She's quoting Oscar?

400
00:18:56,051 --> 00:18:59,805
I write with her husband
for 24 years,

401
00:18:59,888 --> 00:19:02,182
and she's quoting Oscar?

402
00:19:02,266 --> 00:19:05,811
91st on the Park, The Ardsley.
We'll be going late.

403
00:19:05,894 --> 00:19:07,604
All right. Well,
thanks again, fellas.

404
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:12,734
Good evening.

405
00:19:25,038 --> 00:19:28,167
Indulge me for one second.

406
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:30,586
Let me recreate
for you, Elizabeth.

407
00:19:30,669 --> 00:19:33,589
Enough!
Did you screw her or not?

408
00:19:33,672 --> 00:19:36,633
Show some class, Eddie.
Knuckles, may I speak with you?

409
00:19:36,717 --> 00:19:38,135
Oh, sure, yeah.

410
00:19:38,218 --> 00:19:40,053
So,
did you screw her or not?

411
00:19:45,726 --> 00:19:47,144
Elizabeth!

412
00:19:48,103 --> 00:19:49,146
Larry!

413
00:19:49,229 --> 00:19:51,773
My irreplaceable Elizabeth!

414
00:19:51,857 --> 00:19:52,858
I'm so happy to see you.

415
00:19:52,941 --> 00:19:54,443
Ah...

416
00:19:54,526 --> 00:19:56,862
-Do you like the hair?
-I love it.

417
00:19:56,945 --> 00:19:59,072
-It's much better than the red.
-I think so.

418
00:19:59,156 --> 00:20:01,450
I mean, I liked the red, too.

419
00:20:01,533 --> 00:20:03,076
But this is much more
other-worldly.

420
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:04,328
I have to go set up
for the party.

421
00:20:04,411 --> 00:20:06,455
No, no, no.
I got you some flowers!

422
00:20:06,538 --> 00:20:07,706
Aww.

423
00:20:07,789 --> 00:20:09,249
I'm overwhelmed.

424
00:20:09,333 --> 00:20:10,792
Well, I have that effect
on people.

425
00:20:10,876 --> 00:20:13,170
-I have so much to tell you.
-Like what?

426
00:20:13,253 --> 00:20:14,421
I've been writing
in my journal again.

427
00:20:14,504 --> 00:20:15,881
I hope you let me read it.

428
00:20:15,964 --> 00:20:17,507
No, no, no, no. The big one.

429
00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:22,596
And these are what
Richard Rodgers is getting?

430
00:20:24,181 --> 00:20:27,267
Larry, my mother would die
if she saw this.

431
00:20:27,351 --> 00:20:29,228
-With your permission.
-Permission granted.

432
00:20:31,688 --> 00:20:34,233
-That guy I told you about?
-Cooper?

433
00:20:35,359 --> 00:20:36,860
-It finally happened.
-No!

434
00:20:36,944 --> 00:20:39,154
Yes.

435
00:20:39,238 --> 00:20:43,158
On my birthday.
The night of my 20th birthday.

436
00:20:43,242 --> 00:20:45,285
Pretty dramatic actually.
You could write a play about it.

437
00:20:45,369 --> 00:20:48,038
A musical. He Has Risen.

438
00:20:48,121 --> 00:20:49,915
-Larry...
-It's an Easter musical!

439
00:20:49,998 --> 00:20:51,375
It's very religious!

440
00:20:53,043 --> 00:20:54,920
Let me clarify by saying
it almost happened.

441
00:20:55,003 --> 00:20:56,338
Clarify immediately!

442
00:20:56,421 --> 00:20:57,339
I'm gonna tell you
the whole story later.

443
00:20:57,422 --> 00:20:58,632
No, no, I demand

444
00:20:58,715 --> 00:21:01,551
to know the shorthand version
now.

445
00:21:01,635 --> 00:21:03,262
-The shorthand version? Okay.
-Mmm-hmm.

446
00:21:05,472 --> 00:21:07,683
The skin on his back
was flawless.

447
00:21:08,308 --> 00:21:10,644
Gotta run.

448
00:21:10,727 --> 00:21:13,188
You're going to introduce me
to Richard Rodgers, right?

449
00:21:13,272 --> 00:21:14,606
Before the evening is over,

450
00:21:14,690 --> 00:21:16,692
you're going to get
a huge handful of Dick.

451
00:21:16,775 --> 00:21:18,360
Larry! You're so vulgar!

452
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:22,364
Handful of Dick, that's funny.

453
00:21:22,447 --> 00:21:23,448
-Hey...
-Hmm.

454
00:21:25,993 --> 00:21:28,578
I'm writing an entire musical
about her.

455
00:21:28,662 --> 00:21:31,248
It's inspired by those
Frank Capra war pictures

456
00:21:31,331 --> 00:21:32,332
Why We Fight.

457
00:21:32,416 --> 00:21:33,542
This one will be called

458
00:21:34,293 --> 00:21:36,545
Why We Fuck.

459
00:21:36,628 --> 00:21:39,506
And the big ballad at the end
will be

460
00:21:39,589 --> 00:21:42,050
The Skin On His Back
Was Flawless.

461
00:21:44,261 --> 00:21:46,305
Of course, when you're 20,

462
00:21:46,388 --> 00:21:49,474
what other commodity do you have
to trade in on except your body?

463
00:21:49,558 --> 00:21:52,978
You haven't done anything,
right?

464
00:21:53,061 --> 00:21:56,273
Can you imagine what Elizabeth
would write if she saw my back?

465
00:21:57,566 --> 00:21:59,776
"The skin on his back

466
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:03,030
"looked like a white bed sheet
someone had thrown-up on.

467
00:22:03,113 --> 00:22:07,451
"His pecker looked like the horn
of a retarded unicorn."

468
00:22:10,537 --> 00:22:11,580
Just one...

469
00:22:12,956 --> 00:22:14,833
to get me through
congratulating him.

470
00:22:14,916 --> 00:22:17,711
Larry.

471
00:22:17,794 --> 00:22:22,758
To the skin on her back
like every other part of her,

472
00:22:22,841 --> 00:22:24,343
flawless.

473
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:28,638
Wow.

474
00:22:28,722 --> 00:22:31,767
How can so much pleasure
be compressed

475
00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:34,353
into so small a container?

476
00:22:34,436 --> 00:22:38,607
That's it. Absolutely no more.
Agreed?

477
00:22:43,278 --> 00:22:45,197
God! I miss Gershwin.

478
00:22:49,451 --> 00:22:52,079
I bet I saw Porgy
and Bess more times

479
00:22:52,162 --> 00:22:53,997
than any other person
in this city.

480
00:22:54,081 --> 00:22:55,999
Best line in Porgy,

481
00:22:56,083 --> 00:22:59,795
"When Gawd made cripple,
He mean him to be lonely."

482
00:23:02,881 --> 00:23:05,008
Did you ever think
your entire life is a play...

483
00:23:05,092 --> 00:23:06,593
-Hmm.
-...and that, you know,

484
00:23:06,676 --> 00:23:08,220
99% of the people in it,

485
00:23:08,303 --> 00:23:09,679
they got no lines, you know?

486
00:23:09,763 --> 00:23:12,516
They're just like extras.

487
00:23:12,599 --> 00:23:16,895
And you, you're just an extra
in their play.

488
00:23:17,479 --> 00:23:19,564
Deep. Very deep.

489
00:23:19,648 --> 00:23:21,483
-I got thoughts, too, you know.
-Really?

490
00:23:21,566 --> 00:23:23,068
I thought you were
just an extra.

491
00:23:23,151 --> 00:23:25,404
Will somebody get these fucking
flowers off my bar?

492
00:23:26,029 --> 00:23:26,822
Okay!

493
00:23:30,492 --> 00:23:33,328
You've got to see her as I did.

494
00:23:33,412 --> 00:23:35,997
-I just seen her.
-No, the first time.

495
00:23:36,081 --> 00:23:37,833
If you can't see that,

496
00:23:37,916 --> 00:23:40,836
you can't understand
what this whole night is about.

497
00:23:40,919 --> 00:23:42,671
I'm beginning to think
you didn't screw her.

498
00:23:42,754 --> 00:23:46,508
I want to practice this trick
on you before I do it for her.

499
00:23:46,591 --> 00:23:48,093
And I'm not showing it to her
as a trick.

500
00:23:48,176 --> 00:23:52,431
I'm showing it to her
as an experiment to prove

501
00:23:52,514 --> 00:23:54,724
there's an extra-sensory link
between us.

502
00:23:54,808 --> 00:23:56,643
She believes in
all that horseshit, you know,

503
00:23:56,726 --> 00:23:58,812
talking for 20 minutes
about psychokinesis.

504
00:23:58,895 --> 00:24:00,605
I don't understand
a fucking word she's saying.

505
00:24:00,689 --> 00:24:02,816
I'm sitting there,
nodding, thinking,

506
00:24:02,899 --> 00:24:05,235
"Is she really wearing
a grape-colored brassiere?"

507
00:24:08,071 --> 00:24:09,990
And later, I'm going
to teach you boys

508
00:24:10,073 --> 00:24:11,366
my own card game.

509
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:14,077
-Cocksucker's Rummy!
-Larry, language.

510
00:24:14,161 --> 00:24:15,996
Ooh, you're offended
by the word "cocksucker"?

511
00:24:16,079 --> 00:24:18,331
All right, I won't use it.
I give you my word

512
00:24:18,415 --> 00:24:19,916
as a cocksucker.

513
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:23,545
But let me tell you
about the first time I saw her.

514
00:24:23,628 --> 00:24:24,921
I think I'd rather
see the card trick.

515
00:24:25,005 --> 00:24:26,798
Me, too.

516
00:24:26,882 --> 00:24:29,468
You know what the sexiest thing
on the planet earth is?

517
00:24:30,343 --> 00:24:32,179
A half-erect penis.

518
00:24:32,262 --> 00:24:34,097
Jesus Christ, Larry,
nobody wants to hear this.

519
00:24:34,181 --> 00:24:35,307
I'm not talking to you.

520
00:24:35,390 --> 00:24:37,017
-Who you talking to?
-Me.

521
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:38,643
I got to talk to somebody
interesting. I mean it, though.

522
00:24:38,727 --> 00:24:41,188
A half-erect penis is a promise.

523
00:24:41,271 --> 00:24:44,316
A fully-erect penis
is an exclamation point.

524
00:24:44,399 --> 00:24:46,193
As a writer, it offends me.

525
00:24:46,276 --> 00:24:47,861
It's too loud,
it's too adolescent.

526
00:24:47,944 --> 00:24:49,488
The story's already over.

527
00:24:49,571 --> 00:24:54,075
But a half-erect penis,
is it going or is it coming?

528
00:24:57,204 --> 00:25:01,166
But women appeal to me precisely
for their absence of penises.

529
00:25:01,249 --> 00:25:02,918
Me, too.

530
00:25:03,001 --> 00:25:05,295
Oh, they live
in a much more interesting

531
00:25:05,378 --> 00:25:06,963
emotional landscape than we do.

532
00:25:07,047 --> 00:25:09,633
A landscape we can
only dream about.

533
00:25:09,716 --> 00:25:12,886
But this evening
is not about landscapes.

534
00:25:12,969 --> 00:25:15,805
It's a portrait of Elizabeth,
and only Elizabeth.

535
00:25:15,889 --> 00:25:17,432
Here we fucking go again.

536
00:25:17,516 --> 00:25:18,725
Wait, you saw
that she was beautiful, right?

537
00:25:18,808 --> 00:25:20,936
I mean,
if not classically beautiful,

538
00:25:21,019 --> 00:25:22,562
then, what's the right word...

539
00:25:25,690 --> 00:25:26,566
Nice tits.

540
00:25:27,651 --> 00:25:31,029
Small but very inviting.

541
00:25:32,405 --> 00:25:33,990
I wish I could paint her.

542
00:25:34,074 --> 00:25:37,160
That seems to me
the most intimate way

543
00:25:37,244 --> 00:25:38,578
of looking at a person.

544
00:25:38,662 --> 00:25:39,996
At the same time,
the least sentimental.

545
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:42,791
To accurately reproduce
the planes of her face,

546
00:25:42,874 --> 00:25:45,669
the two tiny freckles
on her left cheek.

547
00:25:47,754 --> 00:25:50,549
You look familiar. I've seen
your picture somewhere.

548
00:25:52,092 --> 00:25:52,926
You're a writer?

549
00:25:55,428 --> 00:25:58,139
Well, then you will appreciate
this story.

550
00:25:58,223 --> 00:26:00,016
Because it concerns the...

551
00:26:03,270 --> 00:26:04,354
Ineffable?

552
00:26:05,313 --> 00:26:07,440
That's the perfect word.

553
00:26:07,524 --> 00:26:10,026
Christ! You're E.B. White!
You're "Andy" White!

554
00:26:12,404 --> 00:26:16,283
I cannot tell you
how much I enjoy your essays.

555
00:26:16,366 --> 00:26:18,827
Nothing has given me
more pleasure.

556
00:26:18,910 --> 00:26:21,121
-I'm in love with your language.
-Thank you.

557
00:26:21,204 --> 00:26:22,581
I'm in love
with your punctuation.

558
00:26:22,664 --> 00:26:24,082
You can't move a single comma.
Am I right?

559
00:26:24,165 --> 00:26:26,376
I mean,
you're a musician, White.

560
00:26:26,459 --> 00:26:28,169
You're the musician.

561
00:26:28,253 --> 00:26:32,299
You know, you, above all people,
will appreciate this story.

562
00:26:32,382 --> 00:26:34,843
This girl, Elizabeth.

563
00:26:34,926 --> 00:26:37,554
I... I can't do my act for her.
You know what I mean?

564
00:26:37,637 --> 00:26:40,640
She wouldn't be interested.
She never asks me about me.

565
00:26:40,724 --> 00:26:43,435
Never. And it isn't
so much indifference, I think,

566
00:26:43,518 --> 00:26:45,228
as much as we both recognize

567
00:26:45,312 --> 00:26:47,397
that she's legitimately
more interesting than I am.

568
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:49,190
And I genuinely mean that.

569
00:26:49,274 --> 00:26:51,067
Did you guys see her hair?

570
00:26:51,151 --> 00:26:52,694
That's what I first noticed

571
00:26:52,777 --> 00:26:55,030
when she walked
into the theater last July.

572
00:26:55,113 --> 00:26:58,950
It was as if she were breathing
different air than I was.

573
00:26:59,034 --> 00:27:01,119
-I like that.
-I'm telling you, White,

574
00:27:01,202 --> 00:27:03,622
she would make a great musical!

575
00:27:03,705 --> 00:27:06,875
And not one goddamn corn stalk
in the whole show!

576
00:27:06,958 --> 00:27:09,919
And, hey, fellas,
just for the record,

577
00:27:10,003 --> 00:27:13,089
"The corn is as high
as an elephant's eye"

578
00:27:13,173 --> 00:27:15,508
is the stupidest lyric

579
00:27:15,592 --> 00:27:17,510
in the history
of American songwriting.

580
00:27:17,594 --> 00:27:19,929
Yes, it makes perfect sense,
and, yes, it scans,

581
00:27:20,013 --> 00:27:24,100
but the image
of an Oklahoma cornfield

582
00:27:24,184 --> 00:27:26,853
with a fucking elephant
standing in the middle of it?

583
00:27:26,936 --> 00:27:28,146
I like elephants.

584
00:27:28,229 --> 00:27:29,522
Yeah, we all like elephants,
Eddie.

585
00:27:29,606 --> 00:27:31,399
Look, Andy,
I need you to see this.

586
00:27:31,483 --> 00:27:33,068
I'm listening to her talk,

587
00:27:33,151 --> 00:27:35,153
but I couldn't tell you
a single word she said

588
00:27:35,236 --> 00:27:37,197
'cause all I'm really
thinking is,

589
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:39,783
"Wait till you feel the warmth
of her glance,

590
00:27:39,866 --> 00:27:42,911
"pensive and sweet and wise."

591
00:27:42,994 --> 00:27:47,040
I was writing about her
when I wrote that lyric.

592
00:27:47,123 --> 00:27:50,669
Three perfect words,
in the perfect order.

593
00:27:51,461 --> 00:27:53,505
And, you tell me,

594
00:27:53,588 --> 00:27:55,715
what other lyricist could've
gotten away with "pensive"?

595
00:27:55,799 --> 00:27:57,550
What song was that?

596
00:27:57,634 --> 00:27:59,803
Just telling you,
when I'm good, I'm really good.

597
00:27:59,886 --> 00:28:02,263
Just the sound of it!
That's what a writer does.

598
00:28:02,347 --> 00:28:05,517
We wear our vulnerability
like a cloak

599
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:07,060
for all the world to witness.

600
00:28:07,936 --> 00:28:09,521
I like the word "cloak."

601
00:28:09,604 --> 00:28:12,065
That's 'cause
it's an antique like us.

602
00:28:12,148 --> 00:28:13,358
Can I get you another drink?

603
00:28:16,027 --> 00:28:17,320
Sure. Why not?

604
00:28:17,404 --> 00:28:19,447
I can think of
a thousand reasons why not,

605
00:28:19,531 --> 00:28:21,783
but they can't compete
with the reasons why.

606
00:28:21,866 --> 00:28:24,411
Eddie, pass the Lord
and praise the house physician!

607
00:28:24,494 --> 00:28:26,705
Another round!
Just a little, just...

608
00:28:28,832 --> 00:28:30,500
You know
what I loved in that essay

609
00:28:30,583 --> 00:28:32,335
you wrote about Florida?

610
00:28:32,419 --> 00:28:34,295
That line.

611
00:28:34,379 --> 00:28:39,426
"The sea answers all questions
and always the same way...

612
00:28:39,509 --> 00:28:41,803
"'So soon?'"

613
00:28:41,886 --> 00:28:43,430
Jesus.

614
00:28:43,513 --> 00:28:47,100
To take a sound
and transform it into what?

615
00:28:48,435 --> 00:28:50,353
A sigh of eternity.

616
00:28:51,563 --> 00:28:52,939
My diminutive gift.

617
00:28:54,274 --> 00:28:57,235
To the poetry
that pours down on us

618
00:28:57,318 --> 00:28:59,696
from a thousand
unexpected sources.

619
00:28:59,779 --> 00:29:00,989
To your poetry.

620
00:29:02,031 --> 00:29:02,866
Hmm.

621
00:29:07,245 --> 00:29:10,331
Look, she's 20, I'm 47.

622
00:29:10,415 --> 00:29:13,126
Let's discuss this like two
sensible alcoholics.

623
00:29:13,209 --> 00:29:15,044
It was in the beginning,

624
00:29:15,128 --> 00:29:17,172
everything was exactly
as it seemed.

625
00:29:17,255 --> 00:29:20,091
I was her mentor,
and I suppose I was, you know,

626
00:29:20,175 --> 00:29:22,385
the "grand old man"
of the theater in her eyes.

627
00:29:22,469 --> 00:29:25,054
I'm over at the Shubert
rehearsing By Jupiter,

628
00:29:25,138 --> 00:29:27,223
the show is a holy mess.

629
00:29:27,307 --> 00:29:29,601
And I'm having this debate
with Johnny Green

630
00:29:29,684 --> 00:29:31,311
about the lyrics
to Give My Regards to Broadway.

631
00:29:31,394 --> 00:29:35,732
I remember, as a kid,
falling in love with that song.

632
00:29:35,815 --> 00:29:38,735
♪ Give my regards
to old Broadway ♪

633
00:29:38,818 --> 00:29:41,446
♪ And say that
I'll be there 'ere long ♪

634
00:29:41,529 --> 00:29:44,407
I knew instantly,
even as a kid,

635
00:29:44,491 --> 00:29:46,326
that what gave that line
its speed,

636
00:29:46,409 --> 00:29:48,244
its inevitability,
was the inner rhyme.

637
00:29:48,328 --> 00:29:49,454
And not just the "there, 'ere."

638
00:29:49,537 --> 00:29:50,955
But the other one.
The "way, say."

639
00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:52,624
The line should logically be,

640
00:29:52,707 --> 00:29:54,042
"Give my regards to old Broadway

641
00:29:54,125 --> 00:29:55,627
"and tell them
that I'll be there."

642
00:29:55,710 --> 00:29:58,046
But to change the verb to "say,"

643
00:29:59,714 --> 00:30:01,508
it made all the difference.

644
00:30:01,591 --> 00:30:03,218
Knuckles, do you know any Cohan?

645
00:30:05,136 --> 00:30:09,098
♪ Over there!
Over there! ♪

646
00:30:09,182 --> 00:30:13,019
♪ Send the word, send the word
Over there ♪

647
00:30:13,102 --> 00:30:17,482
♪ That the Yanks are coming!
The Yanks are coming! ♪

648
00:30:17,565 --> 00:30:21,444
♪ The drum drum-drumming
everywhere... ♪

649
00:30:21,528 --> 00:30:25,615
♪ We'll be over
We're coming over! ♪

650
00:30:25,698 --> 00:30:30,328
♪ And we won't come back
'till it's over, over there! ♪

651
00:30:30,411 --> 00:30:32,580
You know what the Yanks really
sang in the Great War?

652
00:30:32,664 --> 00:30:35,750
"We won't come back.
We'll be buried over there!"

653
00:30:37,460 --> 00:30:39,504
And they were.

654
00:30:39,587 --> 00:30:43,424
Total number of deaths
in the Great War, 37 million.

655
00:30:45,093 --> 00:30:46,970
I think maybe
the adjective "great"

656
00:30:47,053 --> 00:30:49,347
should never precede
the word "war."

657
00:30:49,430 --> 00:30:51,391
Amen to that.

658
00:30:51,474 --> 00:30:54,435
What does God think when he
looks down on his creation

659
00:30:54,519 --> 00:30:56,646
and sees that under
the noblest of motives,

660
00:30:56,729 --> 00:30:59,524
we sent 37 million people
to their grave?

661
00:30:59,607 --> 00:31:02,026
That's why it's raining
all the time. God is weeping.

662
00:31:02,986 --> 00:31:05,029
Well, I'm a patriot. I am.

663
00:31:05,113 --> 00:31:07,282
I mean, you're a soldier.
God bless you.

664
00:31:07,365 --> 00:31:09,784
But how many are going to die
this time around?

665
00:31:09,868 --> 00:31:12,328
Will we even be able
to put a number on it?

666
00:31:12,412 --> 00:31:15,039
I'm on leave.
Taking care of my mother.

667
00:31:15,123 --> 00:31:16,708
She's more terrified than I am.

668
00:31:16,791 --> 00:31:18,042
When do you ship out?

669
00:31:18,126 --> 00:31:19,711
In two weeks,
they're sending me back

670
00:31:19,794 --> 00:31:21,254
to that hotbed
of enemy activity.

671
00:31:22,213 --> 00:31:23,631
Bradley Beach, New Jersey.

672
00:31:23,715 --> 00:31:25,425
I'm teaching Morse code
at the Hotel Grossman.

673
00:31:25,508 --> 00:31:26,968
Bradley Beach,

674
00:31:27,051 --> 00:31:29,929
where enemy agents
stroll the boardwalk

675
00:31:30,013 --> 00:31:33,099
disguised as elderly
Jewish women in furs.

676
00:31:33,182 --> 00:31:34,517
I used to play hide the sausage

677
00:31:34,601 --> 00:31:36,019
with a girl from Bradley Beach.

678
00:31:36,102 --> 00:31:37,770
Oh, yeah?

679
00:31:37,854 --> 00:31:40,315
Did you read that piece
in Life about Guadalcanal?

680
00:31:40,398 --> 00:31:42,442
Mm-mm.
-How before the battle,

681
00:31:42,525 --> 00:31:44,527
the soldiers were skipping
silver dollars in the water

682
00:31:44,611 --> 00:31:46,195
instead of stones

683
00:31:46,279 --> 00:31:48,406
'cause they knew
they were never coming back.

684
00:31:51,826 --> 00:31:53,995
I couldn't enlist. My eyes.

685
00:31:54,078 --> 00:31:55,914
What's the matter? They open?

686
00:31:57,832 --> 00:32:00,793
Speaking of people
who are not coming back,

687
00:32:00,877 --> 00:32:03,129
I would like you to read this.

688
00:32:03,212 --> 00:32:04,672
It's from
the By Jupiter playbill.

689
00:32:11,429 --> 00:32:12,263
Out loud!

690
00:32:17,310 --> 00:32:18,561
Uh...

691
00:32:18,645 --> 00:32:20,188
"Rodgers and Hart,

692
00:32:20,271 --> 00:32:22,607
"they're as different
as a dachshund and a dromedary.

693
00:32:22,690 --> 00:32:24,359
"One likes opera and home life,

694
00:32:24,442 --> 00:32:26,861
"the other goes
for night clubs and people.

695
00:32:26,945 --> 00:32:28,446
"One is married
and has two children,

696
00:32:28,529 --> 00:32:30,573
"the other is single
and supports bartenders."

697
00:32:30,657 --> 00:32:31,950
You're welcome, Eddie.

698
00:32:33,534 --> 00:32:36,079
"The little fella,
that's Larry, smokes cigars,

699
00:32:36,162 --> 00:32:38,665
"big, black, small, brown,
any kind.

700
00:32:38,748 --> 00:32:41,876
"While Dick, that's Rodgers,
only uses cigarettes.

701
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:44,671
"One goes to bed
about 4:30 every morning,

702
00:32:44,754 --> 00:32:46,005
"the other never dissipates."

703
00:32:46,089 --> 00:32:47,966
-Perfect verb, right?
-Mmm.

704
00:32:48,883 --> 00:32:50,134
"Despite their physical

705
00:32:50,218 --> 00:32:51,928
"and temperamental differences,
however,

706
00:32:52,011 --> 00:32:54,889
"their intellects complement
each other like ham and eggs.

707
00:32:54,973 --> 00:32:57,600
"Their individual songs
number well over a thousand."

708
00:32:57,684 --> 00:32:59,644
A thousand songs?

709
00:32:59,727 --> 00:33:01,646
"They disagree violently,
but they never fight,

710
00:33:01,729 --> 00:33:03,022
"and in the 20-odd years

711
00:33:03,106 --> 00:33:04,774
"they've been
practicing their craft,

712
00:33:04,857 --> 00:33:06,734
"they have never worked
with anyone but each other..."

713
00:33:06,818 --> 00:33:07,860
Until now.

714
00:33:09,112 --> 00:33:10,655
Impressive.

715
00:33:10,738 --> 00:33:12,532
I wrote it myself.

716
00:33:12,615 --> 00:33:17,286
And not one single mention
of Blue fucking Moon.

717
00:33:17,370 --> 00:33:19,455
I sent Elizabeth
some of my sheet music.

718
00:33:19,539 --> 00:33:21,541
No response. I don't get it.

719
00:33:21,624 --> 00:33:23,126
She's a bitch.

720
00:33:23,209 --> 00:33:25,253
That's what they're gonna
put on my tombstone.

721
00:33:25,336 --> 00:33:28,464
-"She's a bitch"?
-"Lorenz Milton Hart.

722
00:33:29,215 --> 00:33:30,591
"He didn't get it."

723
00:33:30,675 --> 00:33:31,843
And people will come to
my gravesite and say,

724
00:33:31,926 --> 00:33:33,219
"You know what?
I didn't get it either.

725
00:33:33,302 --> 00:33:34,679
I definitely didn't get it.

726
00:33:34,762 --> 00:33:37,890
-Hey, Larr, I get it!
-So, listen.

727
00:33:37,974 --> 00:33:40,351
Elizabeth and I had a weekend.

728
00:33:40,435 --> 00:33:41,811
We actually did.

729
00:33:41,894 --> 00:33:44,063
One passionate,

730
00:33:44,147 --> 00:33:46,274
transcendent weekend,
end of last summer

731
00:33:46,357 --> 00:33:48,359
before she went back to Yale.

732
00:33:48,443 --> 00:33:51,738
It's the closest I've ever felt
in my life

733
00:33:51,821 --> 00:33:54,365
to pure selflessness.

734
00:33:54,449 --> 00:33:56,659
It was nuanced, it was deep.

735
00:33:56,743 --> 00:33:58,578
How deep exactly?

736
00:33:58,661 --> 00:34:01,247
Listen, clown. I met her,

737
00:34:01,330 --> 00:34:05,084
and the first thing I said
to her was, "Excuse me,

738
00:34:05,168 --> 00:34:08,296
"but you have the best style
of anyone in this theater."

739
00:34:09,797 --> 00:34:11,758
I wish I had a photograph
of that moment.

740
00:34:11,841 --> 00:34:13,134
I wish I had a photograph

741
00:34:13,217 --> 00:34:15,470
of every moment
I've spent with her.

742
00:34:15,553 --> 00:34:18,514
I'm having trouble
getting this right.

743
00:34:18,598 --> 00:34:21,642
I'm trying to pin down...

744
00:34:21,726 --> 00:34:23,853
Oh, Andy, help me.
What's the right word?

745
00:34:24,645 --> 00:34:25,563
Enchantment?

746
00:34:27,023 --> 00:34:28,441
And you know how hard that is.

747
00:34:29,609 --> 00:34:31,778
I couldn't believe
that it was me

748
00:34:31,861 --> 00:34:33,112
she wanted to talk to.

749
00:34:33,196 --> 00:34:34,989
I kept looking
around the theater,

750
00:34:35,073 --> 00:34:37,158
there must be somebody else
she's interested in.

751
00:34:37,241 --> 00:34:39,285
But no!
She's plunking herself down

752
00:34:39,368 --> 00:34:40,703
in the theater seat
right next to me,

753
00:34:40,787 --> 00:34:43,915
as close as modesty will allow.

754
00:34:43,998 --> 00:34:47,126
And my heart is actually racing.

755
00:34:47,210 --> 00:34:50,379
And I don't ever feel this way,
not for men or for women.

756
00:34:50,463 --> 00:34:55,301
But she's wearing
this yellow sundress,

757
00:34:55,384 --> 00:34:58,221
and it is hot in the theater.

758
00:34:58,304 --> 00:35:00,139
And she's talking
to me for hours.

759
00:35:00,223 --> 00:35:03,518
Bare leg draped
over the armrest.

760
00:35:03,601 --> 00:35:05,937
And I know this sounds like
I'm some middle-aged putz

761
00:35:06,020 --> 00:35:07,355
with a crush on a pretty co-ed,

762
00:35:07,438 --> 00:35:09,315
and maybe that's what it is.

763
00:35:09,398 --> 00:35:11,234
But you know something?

764
00:35:11,317 --> 00:35:15,738
Maybe that's not
what it is.

765
00:35:15,822 --> 00:35:19,575
Sometimes I feel...
and don't laugh,

766
00:35:19,659 --> 00:35:24,622
after a lifetime of blindly
colliding into strangers,

767
00:35:24,705 --> 00:35:26,124
we've finally found a friend.

768
00:35:27,667 --> 00:35:29,752
Maybe that's the definition
of enchantment.

769
00:35:30,711 --> 00:35:34,173
One light-filled weekend!

770
00:35:34,257 --> 00:35:35,550
I've got to finish
telling you this

771
00:35:35,633 --> 00:35:36,926
before she comes back.

772
00:35:37,009 --> 00:35:38,553
Are you listening to me?

773
00:35:38,636 --> 00:35:40,513
Yeah, she got her legs
draped over the thing.

774
00:35:40,596 --> 00:35:43,182
It was as if all the love lyrics
I had ever written

775
00:35:43,266 --> 00:35:45,226
had, like, some sort
of verbal ectoplasm,

776
00:35:45,309 --> 00:35:47,270
suddenly taken human form.

777
00:35:47,353 --> 00:35:48,354
Ecto what?

778
00:35:48,437 --> 00:35:49,438
That might be her mother.

779
00:35:49,522 --> 00:35:50,940
She cannot hear this.

780
00:35:51,941 --> 00:35:53,151
What about me?

781
00:35:53,234 --> 00:35:54,902
You're just an extra.

782
00:35:54,986 --> 00:35:56,404
Okay, but I still
get paid, right?

783
00:35:56,487 --> 00:35:59,282
Absolutely.

784
00:35:59,365 --> 00:36:02,493
It's important to me
that I nail this down.

785
00:36:02,577 --> 00:36:04,787
It was a boiling hot
summer weekend,

786
00:36:04,871 --> 00:36:06,372
and I asked,

787
00:36:06,455 --> 00:36:08,749
with all the casualness
I could counterfeit,

788
00:36:08,833 --> 00:36:12,378
if she'd like to, you know,
escape the heat of the city,

789
00:36:12,461 --> 00:36:15,006
spend the weekend with me
on Lake Dunmore in Vermont.

790
00:36:15,089 --> 00:36:18,676
And without a moment's
hesitation she said,

791
00:36:18,759 --> 00:36:19,927
"I'd love to, Larry."

792
00:36:21,637 --> 00:36:24,223
Oh, I'm telling you, Andy,
this is my type of girl.

793
00:36:24,307 --> 00:36:26,601
I'm sorry,
excuse me, I'm babbling,

794
00:36:26,684 --> 00:36:31,856
but how else do you describe
the actual present tense

795
00:36:31,939 --> 00:36:33,399
of falling in love?

796
00:36:34,901 --> 00:36:37,236
Is that what this is?

797
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:40,781
Maybe. I mean, I haven't done
anything wrong, okay?

798
00:36:40,865 --> 00:36:44,619
I haven't violated the Mann Act
or even the Middle-Aged Man Act.

799
00:36:44,702 --> 00:36:46,537
I bought her this painting
of Lake Dunmore,

800
00:36:46,621 --> 00:36:48,456
bought it off
this old salt Vermonter.

801
00:36:48,539 --> 00:36:51,459
I bought it
so that she might remember.

802
00:36:51,542 --> 00:36:54,128
I once did a little canoeing
up around there.

803
00:36:54,212 --> 00:36:55,671
Hey, Larry!

804
00:36:59,759 --> 00:37:00,635
And then?

805
00:37:01,636 --> 00:37:05,306
Act Three. Later that day,

806
00:37:05,389 --> 00:37:06,849
she's in the warmth
of the cabin.

807
00:37:06,933 --> 00:37:08,351
There's a pennant

808
00:37:08,434 --> 00:37:10,478
from Fort Ticonderoga
pinned to the wall.

809
00:37:10,561 --> 00:37:13,689
She's wearing
this blue men's work shirt

810
00:37:13,773 --> 00:37:15,107
with the sleeves rolled up.

811
00:37:15,191 --> 00:37:18,861
All of her suddenly
available to me,

812
00:37:18,945 --> 00:37:22,657
this gift of youth and brain

813
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:24,283
and clavicle.

814
00:37:24,367 --> 00:37:26,494
I touched her shoulder,

815
00:37:27,912 --> 00:37:30,456
and as some hack once scribbled,

816
00:37:30,539 --> 00:37:32,250
"My heart stood still."

817
00:37:33,459 --> 00:37:37,129
She took my hand
and said, "Larry,

818
00:37:37,213 --> 00:37:39,882
"let's save this
for another day."

819
00:37:41,384 --> 00:37:43,219
And all I can tell you,
my friend,

820
00:37:43,302 --> 00:37:48,933
is there is a real possibility
that tonight is "another day."

821
00:37:54,730 --> 00:37:55,690
Clearing back
a little bit.

822
00:37:55,773 --> 00:37:57,900
Ladies, beautiful, beautiful!

823
00:37:58,985 --> 00:38:01,779
Rodgers! Rodgers!

824
00:38:01,862 --> 00:38:03,281
Yeah, beautiful!

825
00:38:03,864 --> 00:38:05,783
Okay.

826
00:38:05,866 --> 00:38:06,909
I appreciate that. Thanks.

827
00:38:06,993 --> 00:38:08,119
Hey, thank you so much.

828
00:38:08,202 --> 00:38:09,704
I appreciate it. Thank you.

829
00:38:09,787 --> 00:38:10,621
Bravo!

830
00:38:12,748 --> 00:38:14,792
Thank you so much.

831
00:38:14,875 --> 00:38:17,503
Now, time for the real
performance of the evening.

832
00:38:26,512 --> 00:38:28,764
Eddie, Eddie. Eddie,
get rid of this!

833
00:38:33,394 --> 00:38:34,729
Hey.

834
00:38:34,812 --> 00:38:36,147
So, did he fuck her or not?

835
00:38:36,230 --> 00:38:37,481
He thinks tonight
might be the night.

836
00:38:37,565 --> 00:38:42,194
Oh... Larry. Larry, Larry.

837
00:38:42,278 --> 00:38:44,530
What do you think
she sees in him?

838
00:38:44,613 --> 00:38:46,365
I think she sees
a rich and famous guy

839
00:38:46,449 --> 00:38:47,491
who can help her career.

840
00:38:49,076 --> 00:38:51,537
I think she recognizes
she's being adored

841
00:38:51,620 --> 00:38:55,082
by one of the great appreciators
of beauty.

842
00:38:55,166 --> 00:38:58,169
-You know what else I think?
-Yeah?

843
00:38:58,252 --> 00:39:00,588
I think she is wearing
a grape-colored brassiere.

844
00:39:00,671 --> 00:39:04,216
All right, Rodgers.
Gentlemen, please let's get one.

845
00:39:04,300 --> 00:39:06,427
Beautiful. Come on.
All right, big smile!

846
00:39:07,511 --> 00:39:09,638
-Beautiful.
-Dick! Dick!

847
00:39:09,722 --> 00:39:13,559
My God! The show
is going to run 20 years!

848
00:39:13,642 --> 00:39:16,270
It's going to be bigger
than Abie's Irish Rose!

849
00:39:16,354 --> 00:39:17,855
-We'll see.
-And much more goyish,

850
00:39:17,938 --> 00:39:19,231
so it can tour.

851
00:39:19,315 --> 00:39:20,858
Well, thanks
for coming, Larry.

852
00:39:20,941 --> 00:39:22,651
-Oh, Oscar!
-Larry.

853
00:39:22,735 --> 00:39:25,446
You get taller
every time I see you.

854
00:39:25,529 --> 00:39:28,199
What can I say?
The lyrics are brilliant.

855
00:39:28,282 --> 00:39:30,034
Poetic when they need
to be poetic,

856
00:39:30,117 --> 00:39:31,744
funny when they need
to be funny.

857
00:39:31,827 --> 00:39:35,247
Not a rhyme out of place,
easy on the ear.

858
00:39:35,331 --> 00:39:38,417
♪ I'm just a fool
when lights are low ♪

859
00:39:38,501 --> 00:39:41,045
Perfect!
Did you hear me applauding?

860
00:39:41,128 --> 00:39:42,088
I think you were
the loudest person

861
00:39:42,171 --> 00:39:43,672
in the entire theater!

862
00:39:43,756 --> 00:39:44,548
That's because I loved it
more than anyone else

863
00:39:44,632 --> 00:39:46,342
in the entire theater!

864
00:39:46,425 --> 00:39:47,927
-Let me get you boys a drink.
-Oh, no, thank you.

865
00:39:48,010 --> 00:39:50,012
-Um...
-Larry, you got two minutes?

866
00:39:50,096 --> 00:39:51,263
Give us a minute.

867
00:39:51,347 --> 00:39:52,390
Excuse us, Oscar.

868
00:39:57,812 --> 00:39:58,646
Um...

869
00:40:00,272 --> 00:40:01,982
So, uh, Dwight Wiman and I

870
00:40:02,066 --> 00:40:03,401
have been talking about bringing
back A Connecticut Yankee.

871
00:40:03,484 --> 00:40:04,819
Terrific!

872
00:40:04,902 --> 00:40:07,279
Yeah, I'm thinking of asking
Vivienne Segal.

873
00:40:07,363 --> 00:40:10,199
Oh! Mein Gott! Oh, it's gonna
run longer than Oklahoma!

874
00:40:10,282 --> 00:40:11,909
I'll buy 50 seats myself.

875
00:40:11,992 --> 00:40:13,536
I've got a new title,

876
00:40:13,619 --> 00:40:14,787
Ohh, Camelot!

877
00:40:16,664 --> 00:40:17,998
Well, I think we're gonna stick
with A Connecticut Yankee.

878
00:40:18,082 --> 00:40:19,792
Camelot Exclamation Point?

879
00:40:19,875 --> 00:40:21,877
Okay, come on.
I'm being serious here.

880
00:40:21,961 --> 00:40:24,338
I'm always serious. That's why
people find me so funny.

881
00:40:24,422 --> 00:40:27,091
So I was thinking, if you feel
up to working, then maybe...

882
00:40:27,174 --> 00:40:28,926
I've never felt better
in my life, Dick.

883
00:40:29,009 --> 00:40:30,886
Congratulations, Dick. I don't
want to bother you. I just...

884
00:40:30,970 --> 00:40:32,513
We all just loved it.

885
00:40:32,596 --> 00:40:33,973
-Oh, you did?
-It's going to be a big hit.

886
00:40:34,056 --> 00:40:35,349
Oh, thank you. Thank you.
Appreciate that.

887
00:40:35,433 --> 00:40:36,350
-It's Gladys, right? Yes.
-Yes! Yeah.

888
00:40:36,434 --> 00:40:38,436
Yes, nice to see you. Um...

889
00:40:40,604 --> 00:40:43,899
Yeah, I was... I was thinking,
um, not just a revival,

890
00:40:43,983 --> 00:40:45,359
I was thinking a whole new book.

891
00:40:45,443 --> 00:40:47,528
We were thinking
four or five new numbers.

892
00:40:48,737 --> 00:40:50,197
That I write?

893
00:40:50,281 --> 00:40:51,532
Of course, that you write.
That we write together.

894
00:40:51,615 --> 00:40:53,075
It's been 16 years,
you know that,

895
00:40:53,159 --> 00:40:54,285
since we did that show?

896
00:40:54,368 --> 00:40:55,327
It needs updating,
don't you think?

897
00:40:55,411 --> 00:40:57,621
1927! The Vanderbilt!

898
00:40:57,705 --> 00:40:59,999
Yeah, it can be the new Rodgers
and Hart show for the fall.

899
00:41:00,082 --> 00:41:02,209
-New gags, new songs.
-New references.

900
00:41:02,293 --> 00:41:04,170
We'll satirize the whole war.

901
00:41:04,253 --> 00:41:06,130
Rationing, rubber drives,
nylon drives,

902
00:41:06,213 --> 00:41:08,132
a new number for Vivienne.

903
00:41:08,215 --> 00:41:09,592
-Go easy with the satire, Larry.
-Very nice job.

904
00:41:09,675 --> 00:41:10,551
-Hello, nice to see you.
-Very nice piece.

905
00:41:10,634 --> 00:41:12,303
Appreciate it. Thank you.

Dick! From
the New York Journal-American.

"As enchanting to the eye

-Okay.
-Yeah, it's nice.

916
00:41:28,819 --> 00:41:30,321
That's good. Good start.

917
00:41:30,404 --> 00:41:32,072
So, uh, are you up for that?
Are you feeling healthy?

918
00:41:32,156 --> 00:41:33,782
Is that something
you could take seriously?

919
00:41:33,866 --> 00:41:36,619
Yeah. I'm on the wagon, Dick.
I'm serious.

920
00:41:36,702 --> 00:41:39,371
Been drinking
ginger ale all night.

921
00:41:39,455 --> 00:41:40,873
Well, except for this second

922
00:41:40,956 --> 00:41:43,000
'cause this second
we have to celebrate.

923
00:41:43,083 --> 00:41:44,627
This is the greatest musical

924
00:41:44,710 --> 00:41:46,170
in the history
of American theater.

925
00:41:46,253 --> 00:41:48,297
No, no. I'm not drinking
with you, Larry.

926
00:41:48,380 --> 00:41:50,007
Okay, okay, all right.

927
00:41:50,090 --> 00:41:51,884
Weegee! Weegee! Shoot this!

928
00:41:53,219 --> 00:41:54,261
-What? Oh, no.
-No, no, no.

929
00:41:54,345 --> 00:41:55,471
-Larry, I got to...
-Hey.

930
00:41:55,554 --> 00:41:58,015
Rodgers and Hart,
together again!

931
00:41:58,098 --> 00:41:59,934
All right, closer!
Come on, closer!

932
00:42:03,604 --> 00:42:04,855
I want ten copies of that.

933
00:42:04,939 --> 00:42:06,649
Great. Write me a check.

934
00:42:06,732 --> 00:42:08,192
Yeah.

935
00:42:08,275 --> 00:42:09,652
So, you...
you think you're up to that?

936
00:42:09,735 --> 00:42:11,737
It's the best idea
I've heard in 16 years.

937
00:42:11,820 --> 00:42:13,739
At the same time,
I think we should be

938
00:42:13,822 --> 00:42:16,158
dreaming about
something completely new.

939
00:42:16,242 --> 00:42:18,118
Don't you agree?

940
00:42:18,202 --> 00:42:19,495
New Rodgers and Hart, something
people haven't seen before.

941
00:42:19,578 --> 00:42:21,205
Something big!

942
00:42:21,288 --> 00:42:22,498
Let's start
with the revival first.

943
00:42:22,581 --> 00:42:23,791
Absolutely.

944
00:42:23,874 --> 00:42:25,251
We'll take it one step
at a time...

945
00:42:25,334 --> 00:42:26,710
-Yeah, but...
-...because I really think we...

946
00:42:26,794 --> 00:42:27,753
-Hear me out.
-...can have a future together.

947
00:42:27,836 --> 00:42:30,631
Who doesn't think that?

948
00:42:30,714 --> 00:42:31,840
But I want to be
one of those composers

949
00:42:31,924 --> 00:42:35,010
who works with, uh, you know,

950
00:42:35,094 --> 00:42:36,136
other lyricists.

951
00:42:36,220 --> 00:42:37,805
Like Arlen, Kern. You love Kern.

952
00:42:37,888 --> 00:42:39,598
I love Kern.
I wanted to be Kern.

953
00:42:39,682 --> 00:42:41,267
But we have to work
like professionals, Larry.

954
00:42:41,350 --> 00:42:43,060
Since when haven't I worked
like a professional?

955
00:42:43,143 --> 00:42:45,854
I want to work at specific times
in the morning, at my office.

956
00:42:45,938 --> 00:42:48,274
-I want to adhere to a schedule.
-Yeah. That's what we do.

957
00:42:48,357 --> 00:42:49,692
I don't want to spend any more
time looking for you, Larry.

958
00:42:49,775 --> 00:42:50,818
Well, I'm right here.
Small as life!

959
00:42:50,901 --> 00:42:52,278
You know what I mean.

960
00:42:52,361 --> 00:42:53,612
I don't want to be calling up
your mother

961
00:42:53,696 --> 00:42:55,114
at nine o'clock in the morning,
so that,

962
00:42:55,197 --> 00:42:56,198
maybe, you might
roll out of bed at noon. Right?

963
00:42:56,282 --> 00:42:57,491
-Dick...
-I just don't want to do

964
00:42:57,575 --> 00:42:59,410
what we did.
That's all I'm saying.

965
00:42:59,493 --> 00:43:01,745
It's a business, that's all.

966
00:43:01,829 --> 00:43:03,330
Maybe I shouldn't bring it up
tonight, but I don't know,

967
00:43:03,414 --> 00:43:04,832
-I wanted... I wanted to...
-All I want is to...

968
00:43:04,915 --> 00:43:06,542
That was
your best one yet.

969
00:43:06,625 --> 00:43:08,210
-Really.
-All right, thank you.

970
00:43:08,294 --> 00:43:09,461
-Who is that?
-All I want is to write a show

971
00:43:09,545 --> 00:43:10,588
we both love.

972
00:43:13,382 --> 00:43:14,550
Yeah, I feel the same way.

973
00:43:14,633 --> 00:43:16,927
Dick! Burns Mantle
just called it

974
00:43:17,011 --> 00:43:19,263
"The most thoroughly
and attractively

975
00:43:19,346 --> 00:43:20,806

976
00:43:20,889 --> 00:43:21,890
"since Show Boat."

977
00:43:21,974 --> 00:43:23,183
-Since Show Boat?
-Yeah.

978
00:43:23,267 --> 00:43:25,144
Wow. That's good.

979
00:43:25,227 --> 00:43:27,813
-Truly spectacular.
-Thank you, nice to see you.

980
00:43:27,896 --> 00:43:29,648
I have to fall in love
with a show, Dick.

981
00:43:29,732 --> 00:43:30,649
I have to want
to write that show

982
00:43:30,733 --> 00:43:31,900
more than anything in the world,

983
00:43:31,984 --> 00:43:34,028
to be in that audience,

984
00:43:34,111 --> 00:43:36,030
sitting there
not missing a single word.

985
00:43:36,113 --> 00:43:37,740
All right, well, we start with
A Connecticut Yankee,

986
00:43:37,823 --> 00:43:39,116
four or five numbers,
and we go...

987
00:43:39,199 --> 00:43:40,868
Okay, look.
Here's what I'm thinking.

988
00:43:40,951 --> 00:43:42,453
The Adventures of Marco Polo.

989
00:43:42,536 --> 00:43:44,747
Dick, Dick! Wonderful show.

990
00:43:44,830 --> 00:43:46,749
Oh, thank you so much.
Nice to see you.

991
00:43:46,832 --> 00:43:49,251
Just... just big.
Bigger than Jumbo. Epic.

992
00:43:49,335 --> 00:43:51,337
A three-ring musical circus.

993
00:43:51,420 --> 00:43:54,006
The show lasts four hours
with a dinner break!

994
00:43:54,089 --> 00:43:58,636
It's grand comic opera.
And the stage set is the world!

995
00:43:58,719 --> 00:44:01,305
-Uh-huh.
-We satirize everybody.

996
00:44:01,388 --> 00:44:03,390
And you get to satirize them
musically.

997
00:44:03,474 --> 00:44:05,809
We send up every national
musical cliche there is.

998
00:44:05,893 --> 00:44:07,394
The France number,

999
00:44:07,478 --> 00:44:09,188
the Italian number,

1000
00:44:09,271 --> 00:44:10,939
when they get
to the Heart of Darkness,

1001
00:44:11,023 --> 00:44:13,317
the cannibals are doing
Porgy and Bess. Boom, boom.

1002
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:15,736
♪ Bess,
you is my dinner now! ♪

1003
00:44:15,819 --> 00:44:17,071
Jesus, Larry. Come on.

1004
00:44:17,154 --> 00:44:18,113
This show is going

1005
00:44:18,197 --> 00:44:19,740
to have the scope of a novel.

1006
00:44:19,823 --> 00:44:21,533
It will be
the greatest challenge

1007
00:44:21,617 --> 00:44:23,327
you've ever had as a composer.

1008
00:44:23,410 --> 00:44:24,870
And what grounds it all,

1009
00:44:24,953 --> 00:44:27,164
what lets the audience
enter this story

1010
00:44:27,247 --> 00:44:28,499
is the girl.

1011
00:44:28,582 --> 00:44:30,167
-Uh-huh.
-This ethereal girl

1012
00:44:30,250 --> 00:44:32,378
whom Marco Polo has left behind.

1013
00:44:32,461 --> 00:44:34,797
She's half his age...

1014
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:37,549
...but it's the first time
he's felt that inkling

1015
00:44:37,633 --> 00:44:39,551
of love in years, maybe ever.

1016
00:44:39,635 --> 00:44:41,261
He swears in the first scene.

1017
00:44:41,345 --> 00:44:43,389
We set this up like Benedick
in Much Ado...

1018
00:44:43,472 --> 00:44:45,724
-Right.
-He swears that he's beyond

1019
00:44:45,808 --> 00:44:47,976
the reach of any woman.
He scorns love.

1020
00:44:48,060 --> 00:44:49,728
And we do a whole number
satirizing love songs.

1021
00:44:49,812 --> 00:44:51,939
No. Larry, I want to write shows

1022
00:44:52,022 --> 00:44:53,774
that have some emotional core
to them...

1023
00:44:53,857 --> 00:44:56,110
-Dick, great music. Great show!
-Hello, how are you?

1024
00:44:56,193 --> 00:44:57,986
Thank you. I'll take that.
You're a tough critic.

1025
00:44:58,070 --> 00:44:59,113
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

1026
00:44:59,196 --> 00:45:00,823
Remember, we established

1027
00:45:00,906 --> 00:45:02,408
in the first scene
that he's anti-love?

1028
00:45:02,491 --> 00:45:04,785
Then he meets the girl.
She's a sort of free-spirit,

1029
00:45:04,868 --> 00:45:06,328
Scandinavian-looking

1030
00:45:06,412 --> 00:45:08,789
with two freckles
on her left cheek,

1031
00:45:08,872 --> 00:45:10,374
-it's absurd.
-Don't do that.

1032
00:45:10,457 --> 00:45:13,335
She lives socially,
psychologically, sexually

1033
00:45:13,419 --> 00:45:17,005
in another universe
than he does, but he is slain.

1034
00:45:17,965 --> 00:45:20,259
He stands there paralyzed

1035
00:45:20,342 --> 00:45:23,053
in the light
of her pale green eyes.

1036
00:45:23,137 --> 00:45:26,640
This is the greatest explorer
in the history of the world,

1037
00:45:26,724 --> 00:45:28,726
and none of it
means anything to him

1038
00:45:28,809 --> 00:45:31,145
unless it's a way
to make her see him.

1039
00:45:31,228 --> 00:45:34,773
That is
the emotional core of the story.

1040
00:45:34,857 --> 00:45:36,442
-Okay.
-We take this legendary,

1041
00:45:36,525 --> 00:45:37,693
larger-than-life man,

1042
00:45:37,776 --> 00:45:39,445
and we make him bleed.

1043
00:45:39,528 --> 00:45:41,613
Mr. Rodgers,
my name is Robert Heffner.

1044
00:45:41,697 --> 00:45:43,949
I'm the Mayor of Oklahoma City.

1045
00:45:44,032 --> 00:45:45,868
Eve and I have traveled
all the way to New York

1046
00:45:45,951 --> 00:45:47,453
-just to see the show.
-Okay. You know...

1047
00:45:47,536 --> 00:45:49,329
Welcome to New York.
We're finishing a conversation.

1048
00:45:49,413 --> 00:45:50,581
He'll be with you
in two minutes.

1049
00:45:50,664 --> 00:45:51,832
Does that sound good?

1050
00:45:51,915 --> 00:45:53,041
Two minutes,
I'll be right with you.

1051
00:45:53,125 --> 00:45:54,585
Thank you,
I hope it was worth it.

1052
00:45:54,668 --> 00:45:56,628
-It certainly was.
-Good to see you. Thank you.

1053
00:45:56,712 --> 00:45:58,213
All right, so come on.
Come on, come on, come on.

1054
00:45:58,297 --> 00:46:02,050
And they end up together?
Come on.

1055
00:46:02,134 --> 00:46:05,095
That's what the audience
is waiting around to find out!

1056
00:46:05,179 --> 00:46:06,638
That's the engine
that's driving the whole story.

1057
00:46:06,722 --> 00:46:08,098
All right, well, look, Larry,

1058
00:46:08,182 --> 00:46:09,725
if you're willing to write it,

1059
00:46:09,808 --> 00:46:11,643
really write it, and rewrite it,
and rewrite it again,

1060
00:46:11,727 --> 00:46:13,312
then, you know, it could work.

1061
00:46:13,395 --> 00:46:15,439
But I'm not gonna beg you
for this, Larry. You know?

1062
00:46:15,522 --> 00:46:16,982
We work for 15 minutes,

1063
00:46:17,065 --> 00:46:18,275
you're out the door
looking for a cigar store.

1064
00:46:18,358 --> 00:46:19,651
-It drives me...
-Okay.

1065
00:46:19,735 --> 00:46:21,236
It drives me really crazy.
I don't like it.

1066
00:46:21,320 --> 00:46:22,446
-I don't want to do it anymore.
-We've worked like that

1067
00:46:22,529 --> 00:46:24,031
-for 24 years.
-Congratulations, Dick!

1068
00:46:24,114 --> 00:46:25,407
That's exactly what we've
done for 24 years.

1069
00:46:25,491 --> 00:46:26,408
-Thank you.
-About time the Guild had

1070
00:46:26,492 --> 00:46:27,743
-a goddamned hit.
-Yeah.

1071
00:46:27,826 --> 00:46:28,744
You're absolutely,
absolutely right.

1072
00:46:28,827 --> 00:46:30,037
Anyway, I'm not going to...

1073
00:46:30,120 --> 00:46:31,163
I'm not going to fight
with you, Larry.

1074
00:46:31,246 --> 00:46:32,748
-Who's fighting?
-I don't know.

1075
00:46:32,831 --> 00:46:33,999
With a war on,

1076
00:46:34,082 --> 00:46:35,417
do audiences
really want to watch

1077
00:46:35,501 --> 00:46:36,877
cannibals singing
Porgy and Bess?

1078
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:38,879
And what do audiences
want to watch?

1079
00:46:38,962 --> 00:46:41,423
Cowboys a-whoopin'-it-up
at the box social?

1080
00:46:43,091 --> 00:46:44,635
Well, yes. Apparently.

1081
00:46:44,718 --> 00:46:46,011
Oh, that's right, I forgot.

1082
00:46:46,094 --> 00:46:47,679
Oklahoma, exclamation point,

1083
00:46:47,763 --> 00:46:49,515
addresses the urgency
of a nation at war.

1084
00:46:49,598 --> 00:46:52,935
I think every serviceman
in that audience tonight

1085
00:46:53,018 --> 00:46:54,478
thought about what
we're fighting for,

1086
00:46:54,561 --> 00:46:56,063
even for a second or two,
he thought about it.

1087
00:46:56,146 --> 00:46:57,648
And what is it
we're fighting for, exactly?

1088
00:46:57,731 --> 00:46:59,441
Feisty little girls
in gingham dresses

1089
00:46:59,525 --> 00:47:00,484
who can't say no?

1090
00:47:02,236 --> 00:47:04,446
-Okay. All right.
-Dick, Dick, Dick. Come on.

1091
00:47:04,530 --> 00:47:06,698
Just between you and me,

1092
00:47:06,782 --> 00:47:10,035
those characters are
unrecognizable as human beings.

1093
00:47:10,118 --> 00:47:11,328
I think plenty of people
recognized them.

1094
00:47:11,411 --> 00:47:12,454
They recognized love.

1095
00:47:12,538 --> 00:47:13,831
He needs rescuing, big time.

1096
00:47:13,914 --> 00:47:15,874
They recognized, uh, family.

1097
00:47:15,958 --> 00:47:17,584
They recognized pride
in their country.

1098
00:47:17,668 --> 00:47:19,378
You're starting to sound like
Yankee Doodle Dandy.

1099
00:47:19,461 --> 00:47:21,171
I think there's significantly
more there to recognize, Larry,

1100
00:47:21,255 --> 00:47:22,756
than a bunch
of singing cannibals.

1101
00:47:22,840 --> 00:47:24,550
But cannibals are much funnier,
admit it.

1102
00:47:24,633 --> 00:47:26,260
Dick, you want to come
and read these!

1103
00:47:26,343 --> 00:47:27,928
Yeah, hang on! Hang on.
Be right there.

1104
00:47:28,011 --> 00:47:28,971
Okay, okay, okay, okay.
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

1105
00:47:29,054 --> 00:47:30,681
I know exactly what you mean.

1106
00:47:30,764 --> 00:47:32,516
Just tell me... What do you
really want to write?

1107
00:47:32,599 --> 00:47:34,434
What's your dream show?

1108
00:47:34,518 --> 00:47:35,394
-My dream show?
-Yeah.

1109
00:47:35,477 --> 00:47:36,687
Oklahoma!

1110
00:47:40,148 --> 00:47:40,983
I mean, next.

1111
00:47:43,610 --> 00:47:46,822
Uh... We're talking about
getting the rights to Liliom.

1112
00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:49,867
-The Molnár play?
-Yeah.

1113
00:47:49,950 --> 00:47:51,577
-That was cornball in 1909.
-Yeah?

1114
00:47:51,660 --> 00:47:52,536
You really want
to write a musical

1115
00:47:52,619 --> 00:47:53,704
about a carnival barker

1116
00:47:53,787 --> 00:47:55,455
who beats up his girlfriend,

1117
00:47:55,539 --> 00:47:57,249
-dies, comes back...
-I think it'll work.

1118
00:47:57,332 --> 00:47:58,876
Yeah, and at the end,

1119
00:47:58,959 --> 00:47:59,710
all the dead people could take
off their halos and go,

1120
00:47:59,793 --> 00:48:01,420
"Oh... Purgatory!"

1121
00:48:01,503 --> 00:48:03,839
Look,
I will do it if you force me to.

1122
00:48:03,922 --> 00:48:05,132
-It's just in my heart of...
-No, I'm not forcing you to.

1123
00:48:05,215 --> 00:48:06,300
Oscar's going to do it.

1124
00:48:08,635 --> 00:48:10,053
What does Oscar know

1125
00:48:10,137 --> 00:48:11,722
about turn-of-the-century
Budapest?

1126
00:48:12,681 --> 00:48:14,683
He's going to Americanize it.

1127
00:48:15,601 --> 00:48:16,894
He's going to modernize it.

1128
00:48:17,895 --> 00:48:19,563
We're going to set it in Maine.

1129
00:48:19,646 --> 00:48:21,523
Maine? Right,
with all due respect,

1130
00:48:21,607 --> 00:48:22,858
modernizing Molnár

1131
00:48:22,941 --> 00:48:24,526
-is a deeply...
-You got to read this!

1132
00:48:24,610 --> 00:48:26,528
Is it the Times?

1133
00:48:26,612 --> 00:48:28,864
Burton Rascoe's
World-Telegram review.

1134
00:48:28,947 --> 00:48:30,198
-It's a rave.
-Good.

1135
00:48:30,282 --> 00:48:31,950
We'll have the Times
any moment.

1136
00:48:32,034 --> 00:48:34,077
Okay. Larry, I've got to go.
The Times is coming.

1137
00:48:34,161 --> 00:48:35,287
Okay, okay.

1138
00:48:35,370 --> 00:48:37,372
-Wish me luck.
-Mazel tov!

1139
00:48:37,456 --> 00:48:38,498
As they say in Maine.

1140
00:48:41,084 --> 00:48:42,002
Hey, Dick.
That was perfect.

1141
00:48:42,085 --> 00:48:43,295
Oh, thank you.

1142
00:48:43,378 --> 00:48:44,713
Nice to see you.
Did you enjoy it?

1143
00:49:00,187 --> 00:49:02,147
What does Dick Rodgers
know of Maine?

1144
00:49:02,230 --> 00:49:04,358
He was bar-mitzvahed
for Christ's sake!

1145
00:49:04,441 --> 00:49:06,610
How long are they going
to keep selling that fairy tale?

1146
00:49:06,693 --> 00:49:08,028
"Have faith, have hope,

1147
00:49:08,111 --> 00:49:09,488
"the dead will arise
to comfort us!"

1148
00:49:09,571 --> 00:49:11,448
Like fuck they will.

1149
00:49:11,531 --> 00:49:13,575
Give me another shot,
Eddie. A real one.

1150
00:49:16,578 --> 00:49:18,664
Join me for a shot, Andy?
Please.

1151
00:49:23,752 --> 00:49:26,046
How ya holding up?

1152
00:49:26,129 --> 00:49:27,631
You know how in a marriage
they say

1153
00:49:27,714 --> 00:49:29,466
"for better or for worse"?

1154
00:49:29,549 --> 00:49:31,009
I think in terms of my life,

1155
00:49:31,093 --> 00:49:33,345
I've entered
the "for worse" part.

1156
00:49:33,428 --> 00:49:37,683
And it happened so quietly
I didn't even recognize it.

1157
00:49:37,766 --> 00:49:38,850
Have you ever felt that way?

1158
00:49:39,768 --> 00:49:41,103
Every day of my life.

1159
00:49:43,647 --> 00:49:45,232
Thank you.

1160
00:49:45,315 --> 00:49:47,192
Sometimes I think,
"Even God is finished with me."

1161
00:49:47,275 --> 00:49:48,902
I've had my hits,

1162
00:49:48,986 --> 00:49:51,863
I've loved a small,
dear collection of people.

1163
00:49:51,947 --> 00:49:53,824
And now he's turned the page.

1164
00:49:53,907 --> 00:49:56,910
I feel superannuated.

1165
00:49:56,994 --> 00:49:59,454
"Superannuated."
That's a good thing, isn't it?

1166
00:49:59,538 --> 00:50:00,998
It means your dick doesn't work.

1167
00:50:03,083 --> 00:50:04,251
Must be why
I don't know that word.

1168
00:50:04,334 --> 00:50:05,168
Hmm.

1169
00:50:08,088 --> 00:50:09,381
Put me on the list.

1170
00:50:20,475 --> 00:50:22,477
You notice the birds
are back in Central Park?

1171
00:50:23,854 --> 00:50:26,523
Hmm. What are you working
on these days?

1172
00:50:26,606 --> 00:50:29,401
Children's book.

1173
00:50:29,484 --> 00:50:31,278
Must have burned myself out
writing those essays,

1174
00:50:31,361 --> 00:50:32,195
it's not going well.

1175
00:50:33,405 --> 00:50:35,073
I think,
as far as my writing goes,

1176
00:50:35,157 --> 00:50:36,825
I've also entered
the "for worse" part.

1177
00:50:36,908 --> 00:50:38,910
What's your story about?

1178
00:50:38,994 --> 00:50:40,245
I wish I knew.

1179
00:50:41,830 --> 00:50:43,373
The journey everybody takes?

1180
00:50:44,958 --> 00:50:48,086
Searching for what's perfect
and unattainable?

1181
00:50:48,962 --> 00:50:50,672
The ineffable!

1182
00:50:50,756 --> 00:50:53,759
Probably too elusive an idea
to put into a children's book.

1183
00:50:53,842 --> 00:50:56,678
I have a line for you.

1184
00:50:56,762 --> 00:51:00,098
"He chased her around the bed
all night before concluding

1185
00:51:00,182 --> 00:51:01,558
"she was ineffable."

1186
00:51:01,641 --> 00:51:03,727
Sure you don't mean "uneffable"?

1187
00:51:03,810 --> 00:51:05,479
Better.

1188
00:51:08,398 --> 00:51:09,983
You know,
I'm in the park every morning,

1189
00:51:10,067 --> 00:51:12,152
liberating this mouse
I keep catching in my kitchen.

1190
00:51:12,235 --> 00:51:15,030
-Yeah?
-I have this little glass box

1191
00:51:15,113 --> 00:51:17,824
that captures the mouse
but doesn't kill him.

1192
00:51:17,908 --> 00:51:19,785
And every morning
I walk into my kitchen,

1193
00:51:19,868 --> 00:51:21,161
and there he is,

1194
00:51:21,244 --> 00:51:22,079
at the bottom
of the refrigerator.

1195
00:51:22,162 --> 00:51:23,789
My little brown mouse,

1196
00:51:23,872 --> 00:51:26,208
happily eating the cracker
I left for him.

1197
00:51:26,291 --> 00:51:28,418
And every morning,
I carry him down to the park,

1198
00:51:28,502 --> 00:51:30,545
open the box.
He leaps out ten feet,

1199
00:51:30,629 --> 00:51:32,047
scurries into the underbrush.

1200
00:51:32,130 --> 00:51:34,800
And then the next morning,
I'll be damned,

1201
00:51:34,883 --> 00:51:37,177
he is back in the box!

1202
00:51:37,260 --> 00:51:38,762
How do you know
it's the same mouse?

1203
00:51:38,845 --> 00:51:40,430
Well, he certainly
looks the same.

1204
00:51:40,514 --> 00:51:44,101
He has that same New York look
of doomed hopefulness.

1205
00:51:45,352 --> 00:51:48,105
But how does he get up
the 19 floors?

1206
00:51:49,648 --> 00:51:50,899
Maybe he's tipping the doorman.

1207
00:51:53,819 --> 00:51:56,238
You know,
this morning he wasn't there.

1208
00:51:56,321 --> 00:52:00,492
Just the cracker
lying in the box.

1209
00:52:00,575 --> 00:52:02,410
I actually missed
the little fella, I really did.

1210
00:52:02,494 --> 00:52:04,704
I think I've started
to identify with him.

1211
00:52:04,788 --> 00:52:06,331
Does he have a name?

1212
00:52:07,499 --> 00:52:09,251
I'm calling him Stuart.

1213
00:52:09,334 --> 00:52:11,211
With a "W" or a "U"?

1214
00:52:12,420 --> 00:52:15,173
Hmm. A "U." Nothing fancy.

1215
00:52:15,257 --> 00:52:16,967
Just a regular
middle-class mouse.

1216
00:52:20,971 --> 00:52:23,265
I think you'll have
to excuse me.

1217
00:52:23,348 --> 00:52:26,184
All this jubilation
has gone to my bladder.

1218
00:52:29,521 --> 00:52:32,232
"Agnes de Mille
works small miracles

1219
00:52:32,315 --> 00:52:34,276
"and devising original dances

1220
00:52:34,359 --> 00:52:36,611
"that fit the story
and the tunes.

00:52:36,695 --> 00:52:38,822
"Oklahoma! is fresh..."

1222
00:52:38,905 --> 00:52:41,074
-Okay, I got something funny.
-Hmm.

1223
00:52:41,158 --> 00:52:43,451
What do you call
a tired homosexual?

1224
00:52:43,535 --> 00:52:45,287
I don't know.

1225
00:52:47,747 --> 00:52:48,832
Fuck, I forgot.

1226
00:52:49,749 --> 00:52:50,959
That's really funny.

1227
00:52:53,295 --> 00:52:55,046
"The play's
spine-tingling,

1228
00:52:55,130 --> 00:52:56,756
out of this world!"

1229
00:53:04,681 --> 00:53:06,183
You know,
when Atkinson wrote

1230
00:53:06,266 --> 00:53:08,059
that review for Pal Joey,
you remember that?

1231
00:53:08,894 --> 00:53:11,062
"Drab and mirthless.

1232
00:53:11,146 --> 00:53:15,525
"Can one draw sweet water
from a foul well?"

1233
00:53:15,609 --> 00:53:18,945
I cried.
That's how hurt I was.

1234
00:53:19,029 --> 00:53:22,532
I cried
in Vivienne Segal's arms.

1235
00:53:22,616 --> 00:53:24,159
She hugged me and said,

1236
00:53:24,242 --> 00:53:27,829
"History is going
to prove him wrong, darling."

1237
00:53:27,913 --> 00:53:29,706
Wasn't that
the sweetest thing in the world

1238
00:53:29,789 --> 00:53:30,832
for someone to say?

1239
00:53:32,542 --> 00:53:34,836
And she actually calls me
"darling." Hmph.

1240
00:53:34,920 --> 00:53:36,129
Wow.

1241
00:53:36,213 --> 00:53:37,672
Time magazine wrote,

1242
00:53:37,756 --> 00:53:39,841
"For those who can park
their morals in the lobby,

1243
00:53:39,925 --> 00:53:42,427
"Pal Joey is a wow."

1244
00:53:42,510 --> 00:53:44,763
What kind of piece-of-shit
praise is that?

1245
00:53:46,681 --> 00:53:48,475
I'm talking
about Pal Joey.

1246
00:53:48,558 --> 00:53:49,684
Right.

1247
00:53:49,768 --> 00:53:51,394
I didn't see that one.

1248
00:53:51,478 --> 00:53:55,482
Wolcott Gibbs,
he loved the show.

1249
00:53:55,565 --> 00:53:58,026
He said it was,
"A song and dance production

00:54:05,325 --> 00:54:07,244
-Ah, see? There you go.
-Mmm-hmm.

1253
00:54:08,620 --> 00:54:09,663
You're still going
to introduce me

1254
00:54:09,746 --> 00:54:11,122
to Rodgers tonight, right?

1255
00:54:11,206 --> 00:54:14,042
Urination for me
has turned into a two-act play

1256
00:54:14,125 --> 00:54:15,460
with a brief intermission.

1257
00:54:19,089 --> 00:54:23,468
Oh, I love Vivienne.
God help me.

1258
00:54:24,219 --> 00:54:26,721
Her compassion.

1259
00:54:26,805 --> 00:54:29,224
Oh, did I tell you
she calls me "darling"?

1260
00:54:29,307 --> 00:54:31,559
We were up
at the Starlight Roof.

1261
00:54:31,643 --> 00:54:32,978
I turned to her and I said,

1262
00:54:33,061 --> 00:54:36,773
"Vivienne, will you
please marry me?"

1263
00:54:36,856 --> 00:54:39,526
That's what I told her.
Right to her face.

1264
00:54:39,609 --> 00:54:41,528
Can you imagine
having the courage

1265
00:54:41,611 --> 00:54:43,989
to say that to a woman?

1266
00:54:44,072 --> 00:54:46,157
I've never had the courage
to even dream of saying that.

1267
00:54:46,241 --> 00:54:47,909
Mmm-hmm. Yeah. It was a moment.

1268
00:54:47,993 --> 00:54:50,578
Let me tell you. 2:00 a.m.,
the band was playing

1269
00:54:50,662 --> 00:54:53,498
I've Heard That Song Before.

1270
00:54:53,581 --> 00:54:56,459
She said, "I love you, darling,

1271
00:54:57,377 --> 00:54:58,837
"just not that way."

1272
00:55:01,131 --> 00:55:03,425
"Not that way."

1273
00:55:04,175 --> 00:55:06,970
Three little words.

1274
00:55:07,053 --> 00:55:11,182
Ten little letters that mean,

1275
00:55:11,266 --> 00:55:14,060
"Game over, schmuck."

1276
00:55:15,061 --> 00:55:17,814
Ah, "Think it over," I told her.

1277
00:55:17,897 --> 00:55:21,901
I took her hand in mine,
her nail polish was pale gray...

1278
00:55:27,866 --> 00:55:31,745
Now... I can drink.

1279
00:55:34,831 --> 00:55:36,875
May I remind everybody
what Mike Todd said

1280
00:55:36,958 --> 00:55:38,543
about Oklahoma! in New Haven,

1281
00:55:38,626 --> 00:55:40,295
"No laughs, no tits,

1282
00:55:40,378 --> 00:55:42,005
"no chance"?

1283
00:55:42,088 --> 00:55:43,340
We have a chance now.

1284
00:55:43,423 --> 00:55:46,051
All right, read that out.
Okay, wow.

1285
00:55:46,134 --> 00:55:49,137
Wonderful. This is what
Nichols said in the Times.

1286
00:55:49,220 --> 00:55:51,514
"Wonderful
is the nearest adjective,

1287
00:55:51,598 --> 00:55:53,600

any harm either,

"...because they quite clearly

1313
00:57:16,558 --> 00:57:18,685

"Quite clearly

Come on, everybody!

1316
00:57:25,984 --> 00:57:28,653
Party upstairs!
Cake and champagne.

1317
00:57:39,164 --> 00:57:41,583
Oh, Oscar! Bravo, bravo.

1318
00:57:41,666 --> 00:57:43,460
Congratulations. Oh...

1319
00:57:49,174 --> 00:57:50,550
Can I speak with you
for a moment?

1320
00:57:50,633 --> 00:57:51,676
Can we talk later, Larry?

1321
00:57:51,759 --> 00:57:53,261
No, no, no. It's just a second.

1322
00:57:53,344 --> 00:57:54,554
I have something
important to say.

1323
00:57:54,637 --> 00:57:56,014
Just a moment
with the musical genius.

1324
00:57:58,975 --> 00:58:02,103
I just have one thing
I want to tell you, Dick.

1325
00:58:02,187 --> 00:58:06,774
Uh... Just one second, Dick.
It's important.

1326
00:58:06,858 --> 00:58:08,735
I remember
when I first heard about you,

1327
00:58:08,818 --> 00:58:11,404
you were just Morty Rodger's
little brother.

1328
00:58:11,488 --> 00:58:13,406
-What, were you 17?
-16.

1329
00:58:13,490 --> 00:58:15,158
-Yeah, I was 23.
-Swell job.

1330
00:58:15,241 --> 00:58:16,701
Yeah, you were the wise old man
on the mountain.

1331
00:58:16,784 --> 00:58:18,870
But when I first heard you
play your stuff,

1332
00:58:18,953 --> 00:58:21,706
I knew you had it.

1333
00:58:21,789 --> 00:58:23,666
I wasn't entirely convinced
that I had it,

1334
00:58:23,750 --> 00:58:26,127
but I heard something
that afternoon.

1335
00:58:28,338 --> 00:58:31,508
Originality, melody, grace...

1336
00:58:33,009 --> 00:58:34,552
Oh...

1337
00:58:34,636 --> 00:58:36,679
Come on.
Come on, Larry. Stop it.

1338
00:58:36,763 --> 00:58:38,264
Come on, what's the matter
with you?

1339
00:58:38,348 --> 00:58:41,976
You worked your whole life
for this night, Dick.

1340
00:58:42,060 --> 00:58:44,938
Nobody's worked harder.
And nobody deserves it more.

1341
00:58:45,021 --> 00:58:46,898
All right, thanks.
Thanks, Larry. Thank you.

1342
00:58:46,981 --> 00:58:49,442
All right, that's
what I wanted... Just go...

1343
00:58:49,526 --> 00:58:51,277
...enjoy your party.

1344
00:58:51,361 --> 00:58:53,029
-Hey, look at me. Look at me.
-Mmm-hmm?

1345
00:58:53,112 --> 00:58:55,448
We're going to do
A Connecticut Yankee, all new.

1346
00:58:55,532 --> 00:58:56,324
-Yeah, yeah.
-We're gonna write

1347
00:58:56,407 --> 00:58:57,492
four or five new songs.

1348
00:58:57,575 --> 00:58:59,244
-I have ideas already.
-Right?

1349
00:58:59,327 --> 00:59:01,329
Yeah, yeah. And if I get some
pages down for Marco Polo,

1350
00:59:01,412 --> 00:59:02,497
can I send them over?

1351
00:59:03,915 --> 00:59:05,250
You have to ask me that?

1352
00:59:05,333 --> 00:59:07,710
Larry, I owe
my professional life to you.

♪ Summer journeys
to Niagara ♪

1354
00:59:13,550 --> 00:59:15,051

♪ Aggravate all our cares... ♪

1356
00:59:18,179 --> 00:59:19,806
You remember we heard that
on the radio for the first time?

1357
00:59:19,889 --> 00:59:22,642
In your parents' living room.
Our first hit.

1358
00:59:22,725 --> 00:59:23,977
That was one of the most
astonishing moments

1359
00:59:24,060 --> 00:59:25,144
of my life, Larry.

1360
00:59:25,228 --> 00:59:26,521
I was 22.

1361
00:59:26,604 --> 00:59:29,315
And I'm telling you,
I swear to God,

1362
00:59:29,399 --> 00:59:31,734
our best work
is still ahead of us.

1363
00:59:31,818 --> 00:59:33,820
Yes, the new
Connecticut Yankee!

1364
00:59:33,903 --> 00:59:35,613
Yeah, yeah. And bigger stuff.

1365
00:59:35,697 --> 00:59:37,490
-Dick, get up here.
-All right. I'm coming!

1366
00:59:37,574 --> 00:59:40,535
I mean, Marco Polo is going
to be a show about joy...

1367
00:59:40,618 --> 00:59:45,081
but a hard-earned joy,
an unsentimental joy.

1368
00:59:45,164 --> 00:59:46,249
Something wrong
with sentimental?

1369
00:59:46,332 --> 00:59:47,417
What? It's too easy.

1370
00:59:50,628 --> 00:59:52,922
Oklahoma! is too easy?

1371
00:59:53,006 --> 00:59:54,257
The guy actually
getting the girl

1372
00:59:54,340 --> 00:59:56,009
at the end is too easy?

1373
00:59:56,092 --> 00:59:58,177
You've just eliminated every
successful musical comedy...

1374
00:59:58,261 --> 00:59:59,387
...ever written, Larry.

1375
00:59:59,470 --> 01:00:00,680
Then it's too easy for me.

1376
01:00:00,763 --> 01:00:01,598
Did you hear
the audience tonight?

1377
01:00:02,307 --> 01:00:04,517
Yes.

1378
01:00:04,601 --> 01:00:06,853
Sixteen hundred people
didn't think it was too easy.

1379
01:00:06,936 --> 01:00:08,646
You're telling me
1,600 people are wrong?

1380
01:00:08,730 --> 01:00:10,023
I'm just saying...

1381
01:00:11,357 --> 01:00:14,694
that you and I can do something

1382
01:00:14,777 --> 01:00:17,405
so much more
emotionally complicated.

1383
01:00:17,488 --> 01:00:19,657
We don't have to pander
to what audiences...

1384
01:00:19,741 --> 01:00:21,701
-Oscar and I are pandering?
-No. I didn't say that.

1385
01:00:21,784 --> 01:00:23,786
-Irving Berlin is pandering?
-I love Berlin.

1386
01:00:23,870 --> 01:00:25,163
White Christmas is pandering?

1387
01:00:25,246 --> 01:00:26,456
Well, I don't
believe White Christmas.

1388
01:00:26,539 --> 01:00:28,791
Okay.

1389
01:00:28,875 --> 01:00:30,460
Well, maybe audiences
have changed.

1390
01:00:30,543 --> 01:00:32,462
Well, they still want to laugh.

1391
01:00:32,545 --> 01:00:34,172
They want to laugh,
but not in that way.

1392
01:00:34,255 --> 01:00:36,924
-Not in what way?
-In your way.

1393
01:00:37,008 --> 01:00:38,676
They want to laugh, but they
also want to cry a little.

1394
01:00:38,760 --> 01:00:41,471
They want to...
they want to feel.

1395
01:00:41,554 --> 01:00:42,639
Hmm.

1396
01:00:44,807 --> 01:00:46,768
You're my oldest friend.

1397
01:00:46,851 --> 01:00:49,354
You're...

1398
01:00:50,647 --> 01:00:52,774
-you're unique.
-Hmm.

1399
01:00:52,857 --> 01:00:55,151
Sounds like you're
writing my obituary.

1400
01:00:55,234 --> 01:00:58,112
-I'm just saying.
-I'm right here, right now.

1401
01:00:58,196 --> 01:01:01,115
-Ready to work.
-Yeah?

1402
01:01:01,199 --> 01:01:02,742
Hmm.

1403
01:01:02,825 --> 01:01:05,912
And you're willing to go
back to Doctors Hospital?

1404
01:01:05,995 --> 01:01:08,706
I don't need to go back
to Doctors Hospital,

1405
01:01:08,790 --> 01:01:11,751
and I don't need
a psychiatrist either.

1406
01:01:11,834 --> 01:01:13,169
Thank you very much.

1407
01:01:13,252 --> 01:01:14,379
We were just trying
to help you, Larry.

1408
01:01:14,462 --> 01:01:16,047
Who's we?
You and Oscar? Help me?

1409
01:01:16,130 --> 01:01:17,882
Oscar? You think Oscar
had anything to do with it?

1410
01:01:17,965 --> 01:01:20,927
Oklahoma! is going to be
the biggest hit of your career.

1411
01:01:21,010 --> 01:01:22,470
You don't know that.
You don't know that.

1412
01:01:22,553 --> 01:01:24,263
You got that asshole Kron
to manage my money.

1413
01:01:24,347 --> 01:01:25,848
Now I'm incapable...

1414
01:01:25,932 --> 01:01:27,100
I did that at the insistence
of your brother, Larry.

1415
01:01:27,183 --> 01:01:28,726
Teddy literally begged me...

1416
01:01:28,810 --> 01:01:30,353
Well, maybe you and Teddy
should write the lyrics.

1417
01:01:30,436 --> 01:01:32,105
I did write the lyrics.

1418
01:01:32,188 --> 01:01:34,315
What is that supposed to mean?

1419
01:01:34,399 --> 01:01:37,110
By Jupiter? Have you
conveniently blocked that out?

1420
01:01:37,193 --> 01:01:38,444
Blocked what out?

1421
01:01:38,528 --> 01:01:39,987
How Logan and I begged you

1422
01:01:40,071 --> 01:01:42,031
for extra choruses,
extra verses,

1423
01:01:42,115 --> 01:01:44,992
and you were so drunk
that you didn't even show up.

1424
01:01:45,076 --> 01:01:46,869
So, yes,
I had to write the lyrics.

1425
01:01:46,953 --> 01:01:48,538
You didn't write
one fucking word...

1426
01:01:48,621 --> 01:01:50,081
How would you know?

1427
01:01:50,164 --> 01:01:51,541
-...of that show.
-How would you know, Larry?

1428
01:01:51,624 --> 01:01:53,251
You weren't around to even...

1429
01:01:53,334 --> 01:01:54,794
You know what?

1430
01:01:54,877 --> 01:01:56,421
I'm actually not going to argue
with you tonight,

1431
01:01:56,504 --> 01:01:57,422
-if that's all right with you.
-I like to argue.

1432
01:01:57,505 --> 01:01:59,340
Well I don't. I don't.

1433
01:01:59,424 --> 01:02:00,633
Look, I am sorry.

1434
01:02:01,884 --> 01:02:04,387
I don't care
if somebody attacks me.

1435
01:02:04,470 --> 01:02:06,764
It doesn't mean anything to me.

1436
01:02:06,848 --> 01:02:10,601
But nobody can attack my work.
It is all I've got.

1437
01:02:10,685 --> 01:02:12,395
Your work is brilliant.
That's not the problem.

1438
01:02:15,606 --> 01:02:18,735
Your work has been brilliant
since the day I met you.

1439
01:02:20,111 --> 01:02:22,572
Do you still remember that?

1440
01:02:22,655 --> 01:02:23,781
You, standing there
in your carpet slippers

1441
01:02:23,865 --> 01:02:24,907
and your stripy bathrobe?

1442
01:02:27,034 --> 01:02:31,122
Yeah, with the five o'clock
shadow at 11:00 a.m.

1443
01:02:33,708 --> 01:02:36,627
I'll remember that
till the last day of my life.

1444
01:02:39,547 --> 01:02:41,174
Okay.

1445
01:02:48,556 --> 01:02:50,057
-Larry, I got to go upstairs.
-I know.

1446
01:02:50,141 --> 01:02:51,684
-The whole company's waiting.
-Of course. Of course.

1447
01:02:53,352 --> 01:02:55,021
Four or five songs, yes?

1448
01:02:55,104 --> 01:02:56,773
I'm telling you,
I'm having ideas already!

1449
01:02:57,940 --> 01:02:59,984
A big comedy solo for Vivienne

1450
01:03:00,067 --> 01:03:01,611
about how she's killed off

1451
01:03:01,694 --> 01:03:03,780
every single
one of her previous husbands.

1452
01:03:05,156 --> 01:03:06,449
Might be funny.

1453
01:03:06,532 --> 01:03:08,826
We can call it
To Keep Our Love Alive!

1454
01:03:24,133 --> 01:03:25,802
-You okay, Larry?
-Mmm-hmm.

1455
01:03:30,556 --> 01:03:31,766
What happened to White?

1456
01:03:31,849 --> 01:03:34,852
-Left.
-"So soon?"

1457
01:03:34,936 --> 01:03:37,230
There was so much more
I wanted to say to him.

1458
01:03:37,313 --> 01:03:39,023
Maybe he was an extra, too.

1459
01:03:40,149 --> 01:03:41,025
One more?

1460
01:03:42,026 --> 01:03:42,985
Last one, Larry.

1461
01:03:45,238 --> 01:03:47,824
Do you know
the ineffectual blues?

1462
01:03:50,201 --> 01:03:52,286
That's because
I haven't written it yet.

1463
01:03:55,289 --> 01:03:58,751
They should put
my picture on that bottle.

1464
01:03:58,835 --> 01:04:02,672
"The Whiskey That Made
Lorenz Hart Unemployable."

1465
01:04:02,755 --> 01:04:04,674
"Buy War Bonds."

1466
01:04:11,389 --> 01:04:14,058
You know, I've started
to hear things wrong.

1467
01:04:14,141 --> 01:04:16,894
The other night, I was listening
to this singer go on

1468
01:04:16,978 --> 01:04:19,105
about "her cigarette heart."

1469
01:04:19,188 --> 01:04:22,066
And I thought, "Now that
is an original metaphor,

1470
01:04:22,149 --> 01:04:24,485
"'My cigarette heart.'"

1471
01:04:24,569 --> 01:04:27,780
Then I realized she was singing
"My secret heart."

1472
01:04:27,864 --> 01:04:30,741
I can't remember
anything anymore either.

1473
01:04:30,825 --> 01:04:33,160
That should be the title
of my autobiography,

1474
01:04:33,244 --> 01:04:36,372
"Stop Me
If I've Told You This Already."

1475
01:04:36,455 --> 01:04:39,125
And we'll print the entire text
twice.

1476
01:04:45,882 --> 01:04:48,092
No, I'm serious.
I've seen her do it before.

1477
01:04:48,175 --> 01:04:49,594
As long as there's
no dancing

1478
01:04:49,677 --> 01:04:50,887
later on in the night.

1479
01:04:52,930 --> 01:04:54,348
You better watch yourself...

1480
01:04:54,432 --> 01:04:57,226
My irreplaceable Elizabeth!

1481
01:04:57,310 --> 01:04:58,144
Larry!

1482
01:04:59,270 --> 01:05:01,147
-Do you like it?
-It's...

1483
01:05:01,230 --> 01:05:03,774
Oscar Hammerstein
just said I was a gem!

1484
01:05:03,858 --> 01:05:07,361
He has such a way with words.

1485
01:05:07,445 --> 01:05:09,363
George, this is Lorenz Hart.

1486
01:05:09,447 --> 01:05:11,699
I am legitimately honored
to meet you.

1487
01:05:11,782 --> 01:05:13,117
Would you mind if I spoke

1488
01:05:13,200 --> 01:05:15,286
to Elizabeth alone
for two minutes?

1489
01:05:15,369 --> 01:05:16,954
And then she's all yours.

1490
01:05:17,038 --> 01:05:18,664
It would be perfectly all right

1491
01:05:18,748 --> 01:05:21,125
as long as you promise me
your autograph before I go.

1492
01:05:21,208 --> 01:05:22,752
George is a senior
at Yale.

1493
01:05:22,835 --> 01:05:25,171
He's studying music,
but he wants to be a director.

1494
01:05:25,254 --> 01:05:26,547
A director.
Well, what's your name?

1495
01:05:26,631 --> 01:05:28,341
George Hill.

1496
01:05:28,424 --> 01:05:31,677
Here's my advice to you,
future director, George Hill.

1497
01:05:31,761 --> 01:05:33,095
Do you want my advice?

1498
01:05:33,179 --> 01:05:33,971
I'd be honored.

1499
01:05:35,264 --> 01:05:38,559
Be careful of love stories.

1500
01:05:38,643 --> 01:05:41,395
Think about friendship stories.

1501
01:05:41,479 --> 01:05:46,108
That's where
the really enduring stuff lives.

1502
01:05:46,192 --> 01:05:47,985
-Thank you. I'll remember that.
-Hmm!

1503
01:05:51,364 --> 01:05:52,823
Catch up with you later, George.

1504
01:05:55,368 --> 01:05:56,869
My mother just gave me this.

1505
01:05:56,953 --> 01:05:58,371
I was really touched
she gave it to me.

1506
01:05:59,705 --> 01:06:01,666
My well-tempered clavicle.

1507
01:06:01,749 --> 01:06:03,250
Careful. My mother...

1508
01:06:04,168 --> 01:06:05,920
Okay. All right...

1509
01:06:06,003 --> 01:06:10,174
Sorry. Now, I know your birthday
isn't until November 19th.

1510
01:06:10,257 --> 01:06:11,467
I'm a scorpion.

1511
01:06:11,550 --> 01:06:14,220
I never doubted that
for a second.

1512
01:06:14,303 --> 01:06:16,472
Did you get the sheet music
I sent you?

1513
01:06:16,555 --> 01:06:18,683
Ah, I was so busy with exams,

1514
01:06:18,766 --> 01:06:20,685
I put them away,
honestly, and...

1515
01:06:20,768 --> 01:06:22,103
And then I kind of forgot
about them.

1516
01:06:22,186 --> 01:06:24,146
But now I've got the time.
I promise you.

1517
01:06:24,230 --> 01:06:25,856
I'm going
to get a friend of mine

1518
01:06:25,940 --> 01:06:27,483
to play every single one
of those songs for me.

1519
01:06:27,566 --> 01:06:29,443
Take your time.

1520
01:06:29,527 --> 01:06:31,779
That's the wonderful thing
about art, isn't it?

1521
01:06:31,862 --> 01:06:34,198
It waits for you.

1522
01:06:34,281 --> 01:06:36,242
Thank you for all the letters
you wrote me.

1523
01:06:36,325 --> 01:06:38,077
I really enjoyed reading them.

1524
01:06:38,160 --> 01:06:39,620
My roommate couldn't believe

1525
01:06:39,704 --> 01:06:41,372
I was actually corresponding
with Lorenz Hart.

1526
01:06:41,455 --> 01:06:44,000
I remember in Vermont,
you were drinking red wine.

1527
01:06:45,042 --> 01:06:48,671
Malbec. It's a big Yale drink.

1528
01:06:48,754 --> 01:06:52,466
You ask for the French Malbec,
and then you act

1529
01:06:52,550 --> 01:06:54,510
as if you can actually tell
which vineyard it came from.

1530
01:06:54,593 --> 01:06:56,971
Oh...

1531
01:06:57,054 --> 01:06:59,682
Don't mention Vermont
around my mother, okay?

1532
01:06:59,765 --> 01:07:01,267
She doesn't know anything
about our little getaway.

1533
01:07:02,643 --> 01:07:04,603
Actually, thank goodness.

1534
01:07:04,687 --> 01:07:07,773
She doesn't know about 90%
of what's going on in my life.

1535
01:07:07,857 --> 01:07:10,359
Well, I feel privileged
that I do.

1536
01:07:10,443 --> 01:07:13,654
Or that I did, back in August.

1537
01:07:13,738 --> 01:07:16,282
I've got much more stuff to
report on since then.

1538
01:07:16,365 --> 01:07:19,827
Well, tell me about the guys.
That's what I'm interested in.

1539
01:07:19,910 --> 01:07:23,080
Honestly,

1540
01:07:23,164 --> 01:07:24,707
I'm much smarter
than most of them.

1541
01:07:24,790 --> 01:07:26,125
So I sort of sit back

1542
01:07:26,208 --> 01:07:28,044
and watch them
trying to impress me.

1543
01:07:28,127 --> 01:07:29,712
It's pretty entertaining.

1544
01:07:29,795 --> 01:07:30,921
If I were a college guy,

1545
01:07:31,005 --> 01:07:32,339
I think
I would be afraid of you.

1546
01:07:32,423 --> 01:07:35,301
This intelligent,
mercilessly observant,

1547
01:07:35,384 --> 01:07:37,970
wickedly unsentimental beauty
sitting there,

1548
01:07:38,054 --> 01:07:40,931
evaluating me from somewhere
behind those green eyes,

1549
01:07:41,015 --> 01:07:42,683
annotating all my gaucheries.

1550
01:07:42,767 --> 01:07:44,643
My God, I would be terrified.

1551
01:07:44,727 --> 01:07:46,312
Hey, I'm not that intimidating.

1552
01:07:47,772 --> 01:07:50,066
Tell me more about this Cooper.

1553
01:07:52,401 --> 01:07:53,569
This is embarrassing.

1554
01:07:53,652 --> 01:07:55,112
I love it
when you're embarrassed,

1555
01:07:55,196 --> 01:07:57,782
you get this scarlet blush
that washes up over you,

1556
01:07:57,865 --> 01:08:00,326
and a second later it's gone.

1557
01:08:00,409 --> 01:08:02,620
This one might last
considerably longer.

1558
01:08:02,703 --> 01:08:04,789
-I'd love to...
-Elizabeth. Hello, Larry.

1559
01:08:04,872 --> 01:08:07,958
I hope I'm not interrupting
anything too weighty.

1560
01:08:08,042 --> 01:08:10,086
Well, weighty affairs
will have to wait.

1561
01:08:10,961 --> 01:08:12,630
She's a gem, isn't she?

1562
01:08:12,713 --> 01:08:14,215
Please, Mr. Hammerstein.

1563
01:08:14,298 --> 01:08:15,966
I'll only bother you
for a moment.

1564
01:08:16,050 --> 01:08:18,719
Larry, I just wanted to say...

1565
01:08:18,803 --> 01:08:20,304
Well, firstly, I recognize

1566
01:08:20,387 --> 01:08:22,056
this must be
a difficult night for you.

1567
01:08:22,139 --> 01:08:25,309
No, I'm a professional, Oscar.
We're both professionals,

1568
01:08:25,392 --> 01:08:27,353
we understand the nature
of our business.

1569
01:08:27,436 --> 01:08:30,231
Larry, did you really
like the show?

1570
01:08:30,314 --> 01:08:31,899
I don't think I do
the comedy numbers

1571
01:08:31,982 --> 01:08:34,193
half as well as you do.
They're not my strength.

1572
01:08:34,276 --> 01:08:37,947
I laughed my ass off.
I had to have it re-attached.

1573
01:08:39,740 --> 01:08:42,034
Larry, we're the same age,
but you were always the teacher.

1574
01:08:42,118 --> 01:08:44,328
-No, Oscar. I...
-No, your whole career,

1575
01:08:44,411 --> 01:08:45,913
-you showed us the way.
-Well, I doubt...

1576
01:08:45,996 --> 01:08:47,665
You liberated us all.

1577
01:08:47,748 --> 01:08:49,792
You made American songs

1578
01:08:49,875 --> 01:08:51,418
finally sound
like American speech.

1579
01:08:51,502 --> 01:08:54,004
Stop. I dislike eulogies,
especially my own.

1580
01:08:54,088 --> 01:08:56,841
Oscar, tonight is your night.

1581
01:08:56,924 --> 01:09:00,553
A hit for you and Dick
is a hit for all of us.

1582
01:09:00,636 --> 01:09:03,222
People finally want
to go see shows again.

1583
01:09:03,305 --> 01:09:04,974
Real shows. Dick and I

1584
01:09:05,057 --> 01:09:06,225
were just tossing around
a few ideas.

1585
01:09:06,308 --> 01:09:08,018
-Wonderful.
-Yeah, we have this idea

1586
01:09:08,102 --> 01:09:09,728
for a big...

1587
01:09:10,980 --> 01:09:12,773
Marco Polo show... huge...

1588
01:09:12,857 --> 01:09:14,400
-Wow.
-...a kind of musical circus.

1589
01:09:14,483 --> 01:09:17,069
Dick's excited about it.

1590
01:09:17,153 --> 01:09:18,779
He said you're adapting Liliom.

1591
01:09:18,863 --> 01:09:20,531
Well, if we can
finagle the rights.

1592
01:09:20,614 --> 01:09:22,575
-Sounds exciting.
-Elizabeth told me

1593
01:09:22,658 --> 01:09:24,535
-she's your protégé.
-Stop.

1594
01:09:24,618 --> 01:09:27,037
"She's the promised kiss
of springtime

1595
01:09:27,121 --> 01:09:29,206
"that makes the lonely winter
seem long."

1596
01:09:29,290 --> 01:09:30,332
Oh, please.

1597
01:09:30,416 --> 01:09:32,418
You wrote a great lyric.

1598
01:09:32,501 --> 01:09:33,919
For a show
that didn't run three months.

1599
01:09:34,003 --> 01:09:36,172
-I saw it twice.
-You...

1600
01:09:36,255 --> 01:09:38,465
You know what we're talking
about here, Stevie?

1601
01:09:38,549 --> 01:09:40,885
Very Warm for May.
Produced by Max Gordon.

1602
01:09:40,968 --> 01:09:42,178
Music by Jerome Kern.

1603
01:09:42,261 --> 01:09:44,722
Alvin Theatre. 59 performances.

1604
01:09:46,265 --> 01:09:47,766
This is my neighbor.

1605
01:09:47,850 --> 01:09:50,477
He's a kind of a walking
encyclopedia of musical theater.

1606
01:09:50,561 --> 01:09:53,314
Well, I'm a kind of walking
pneumonia for musical theater.

1607
01:09:53,397 --> 01:09:55,357
-Nice to meet you.
-Pleasure to meet you.

1608
01:09:55,441 --> 01:09:57,109
He wants to write musicals
when he grows up.

1609
01:09:57,193 --> 01:09:58,861
Who's your favorite lyricist?

1610
01:09:58,944 --> 01:10:00,654
-Oscar.
-Mmm-hmm.

1611
01:10:00,738 --> 01:10:02,907
Of course. And what do you think
of my work?

1612
01:10:02,990 --> 01:10:04,658
I like it. It's funny.

1613
01:10:04,742 --> 01:10:05,868
Thank you.

1614
01:10:05,951 --> 01:10:08,078
Can be a little sloppy at times.

1615
01:10:08,162 --> 01:10:10,456
He's very tired.
It's been a long day.

1616
01:10:10,539 --> 01:10:11,999
Come on, Stevie.
It's a long ride

1617
01:10:12,082 --> 01:10:13,667
back to Doylestown.

1618
01:10:13,751 --> 01:10:15,878
-You want to go to the bathroom?
-I'm not tired.

1619
01:10:15,961 --> 01:10:17,963
He asked me
what I thought of his work.

1620
01:10:18,047 --> 01:10:20,090
"Weighty affairs
will just have to wait"?

1621
01:10:20,174 --> 01:10:22,218
I so regret not having children.

1622
01:10:22,968 --> 01:10:25,429
Cooper.

1623
01:10:25,512 --> 01:10:27,056
I can't believe
I'm telling you this.

1624
01:10:27,139 --> 01:10:28,599
-Tell me.
-You have to remember,

1625
01:10:28,682 --> 01:10:29,892
I've had a hopeless crush
on this guy

1626
01:10:29,975 --> 01:10:31,060
for over a year.

1627
01:10:31,143 --> 01:10:33,896
Hold this. Come here.

1628
01:10:33,979 --> 01:10:38,234
Renee, may I buy five minutes
of privacy, please?

1629
01:10:39,193 --> 01:10:40,569
Anything for you, Larry.

1630
01:10:50,788 --> 01:10:51,789
Thank you.

1631
01:10:54,208 --> 01:10:57,086
Tell me what he looks like,
I'm trying to visualize him.

1632
01:10:58,003 --> 01:11:00,381
Apollo? Blue eyes. Tall.

1633
01:11:00,464 --> 01:11:02,716
So, basically,
the skin on his back

1634
01:11:02,800 --> 01:11:04,510
-was flawless...
-Stop.

1635
01:11:04,593 --> 01:11:08,430
It's the night of your birthday.
Tell me everything.

1636
01:11:08,514 --> 01:11:10,099
A group of my friends
are taking...

1637
01:11:10,182 --> 01:11:11,934
Boyfriends, girlfriends?

1638
01:11:12,643 --> 01:11:13,978
-Mixed.
-Okay.

1639
01:11:14,061 --> 01:11:16,188
Come on, Larry,
I'm a college lady.

1640
01:11:17,648 --> 01:11:19,483
So they're taking me to Mory's,

1641
01:11:19,566 --> 01:11:22,152
which is technically
no women allowed,

1642
01:11:22,236 --> 01:11:24,196
but they smuggle us up
those backstairs

1643
01:11:24,280 --> 01:11:25,948
like so much
heavily-scented contraband,

1644
01:11:26,031 --> 01:11:31,036
and, of course, one of the girls
has brought along her date.

1645
01:11:31,120 --> 01:11:32,746
Cooper?

1646
01:11:32,830 --> 01:11:36,375
Which is both destroying me
and exhilarating me.

1647
01:11:36,458 --> 01:11:40,170
I mean, he's there. Near me.

1648
01:11:42,214 --> 01:11:43,757
The evening is getting late,

1649
01:11:43,841 --> 01:11:45,676
empty wine bottles
are filling up the table.

1650
01:11:46,844 --> 01:11:48,971
Half of us are underage,

1651
01:11:49,054 --> 01:11:50,723
but we're flirting
so shamelessly with the waiter

1652
01:11:50,806 --> 01:11:52,141
that nobody seems to care.

1653
01:11:52,224 --> 01:11:55,602
-Drinking your French Malbec.
-Exactly.

1654
01:11:55,686 --> 01:11:58,439
I'm nothing
if not a good student.

1655
01:11:58,522 --> 01:12:00,149
That's why
everybody loves you, Larry.

1656
01:12:00,232 --> 01:12:02,151
You're the best listener
I ever met.

1657
01:12:02,234 --> 01:12:03,444
That's because I have absolutely

1658
01:12:03,527 --> 01:12:05,571
no interest
in myself whatsoever.

1659
01:12:05,654 --> 01:12:07,990
Back to your tale
of natal debauchery.

1660
01:12:08,073 --> 01:12:09,908
Empty wine bottles
filling the table...

1661
01:12:11,327 --> 01:12:13,245
-So it's late.
-Mmm-hmm.

1662
01:12:13,329 --> 01:12:16,040
-And Marjorie...
-The girl who came with Cooper?

1663
01:12:17,082 --> 01:12:18,709
She's left to go home and study.

1664
01:12:18,792 --> 01:12:20,210
Aww...

1665
01:12:20,294 --> 01:12:22,338
People are staggering out
one by one.

1666
01:12:23,130 --> 01:12:25,591
It's midnight.

1667
01:12:25,674 --> 01:12:27,885
And I find myself sitting
right next to him.

1668
01:12:27,968 --> 01:12:30,262
Take your time.

1669
01:12:30,346 --> 01:12:33,932
You know, there's no place else
on earth I'd rather be

1670
01:12:34,016 --> 01:12:36,435
than sitting
right here with you.

1671
01:12:36,518 --> 01:12:37,686
Oh, did you get my letter?

1672
01:12:37,770 --> 01:12:38,854
There's a party
at my place tonight.

1673
01:12:38,937 --> 01:12:40,147
Oh, I think I've got

1674
01:12:40,230 --> 01:12:41,357
to stay here
and help my mother...

1675
01:12:41,440 --> 01:12:42,941
It's not getting started
till late.

1676
01:12:43,025 --> 01:12:46,153
You'll have plenty of time
to work the room here.

1677
01:12:46,236 --> 01:12:48,739
I've got the Golden Gate Quartet
showing up.

1678
01:12:48,822 --> 01:12:49,823
Promise me you'll come.

1679
01:12:49,907 --> 01:12:51,658
320 Central Park West.

1680
01:12:51,742 --> 01:12:54,870
You said you wanted
to design sets and costumes,

1681
01:12:54,953 --> 01:12:57,081
everybody in New York theater
is gonna be there.

1682
01:12:57,164 --> 01:12:58,374
Okay, back to Cooper.

1683
01:12:59,792 --> 01:13:02,378
Okay.

1684
01:13:02,461 --> 01:13:04,963
We leave Mory's together.

1685
01:13:05,047 --> 01:13:09,343
It's a perfect November night.
A fingernail clipping of a moon.

1686
01:13:09,426 --> 01:13:12,805
He's got his arm around me.
We're both a little drunk,

1687
01:13:12,888 --> 01:13:15,724
stumbling in and out
of each other's arms.

1688
01:13:15,808 --> 01:13:17,643
He's wearing this red and green

1689
01:13:17,726 --> 01:13:19,103
flannel shirt
with the sleeves rolled up.

1690
01:13:19,186 --> 01:13:20,396
Not that you noticed.

1691
01:13:21,313 --> 01:13:22,606
He's looking good!

1692
01:13:22,689 --> 01:13:24,441
-And you?
-Um...

1693
01:13:26,151 --> 01:13:27,903
It's my birthday, right?

1694
01:13:27,986 --> 01:13:29,405
I'm supposed
to be looking good.

1695
01:13:29,488 --> 01:13:30,406
Tasty.

1696
01:13:31,865 --> 01:13:34,910
So I'm leaning
against that flannel work shirt,

1697
01:13:34,993 --> 01:13:37,246
and I'm telling you,

1698
01:13:37,329 --> 01:13:39,873
I can smell the maleness
coming off of him.

1699
01:13:41,375 --> 01:13:43,627
I remember thinking
that huge purple letters

1700
01:13:43,710 --> 01:13:45,421
should have lit up the sky...

1701
01:13:47,214 --> 01:13:48,465
-"Desire."
-Okay.

1702
01:13:48,549 --> 01:13:50,259
Hold on one second.

1703
01:13:50,342 --> 01:13:52,052
I have to go find some ice-water
and pour it down my trousers.

1704
01:13:52,136 --> 01:13:54,513
You may need some extra ice.

1705
01:13:54,596 --> 01:13:57,433
We end up in the basement
of his fraternity,

1706
01:13:57,516 --> 01:14:00,686
in this tawdry
sort of derelict bar.

1707
01:14:00,769 --> 01:14:02,479
God only knows
how many acts of depravity

1708
01:14:02,563 --> 01:14:03,564
have taken place down there.

1709
01:14:03,647 --> 01:14:05,107
And here comes one more.

1710
01:14:05,190 --> 01:14:06,483
Oh, yeah.

1711
01:14:09,027 --> 01:14:12,698
So I've been watching this guy
for a year,

1712
01:14:12,781 --> 01:14:16,618
dreaming about him,
and now, here it is.

1713
01:14:17,619 --> 01:14:20,289
The night of my birthday,

1714
01:14:20,372 --> 01:14:23,083
the only light is coming
from this dim little lamp

1715
01:14:23,167 --> 01:14:26,503
with horses and jockeys
printed on the shade.

1716
01:14:26,587 --> 01:14:28,380
I mean, really, Larry,
what's a girl to do?

1717
01:14:29,131 --> 01:14:30,466
Happy birthday!

1718
01:14:33,260 --> 01:14:35,179
He begins
to take off his clothes.

1719
01:14:42,019 --> 01:14:43,729
You really want to hear this?

1720
01:14:43,812 --> 01:14:45,689
Uh, I'm mildly interested.

1721
01:14:48,066 --> 01:14:49,026
It's humiliating.

1722
01:14:50,694 --> 01:14:52,029
'Cause basically
nothing happened.

1723
01:14:53,363 --> 01:14:54,490
Nothing?

1724
01:14:56,617 --> 01:14:58,118
Like you and me
at the lake house?

1725
01:14:58,202 --> 01:15:00,412
No.

1726
01:15:00,496 --> 01:15:03,040
That was a deliberate decision
we made, right?

1727
01:15:03,123 --> 01:15:04,833
Based on what? Rationality?

1728
01:15:04,917 --> 01:15:07,169
I mean, as rational
as you and I ever get.

1729
01:15:09,796 --> 01:15:10,797
But this...

1730
01:15:12,299 --> 01:15:13,926
This was based

1731
01:15:14,009 --> 01:15:15,511
on the fact that he couldn't
get the rubber on.

1732
01:15:16,220 --> 01:15:18,096
Oh, no.

1733
01:15:18,180 --> 01:15:19,515
He tried.

1734
01:15:20,432 --> 01:15:21,725
-He tried again.
-No.

1735
01:15:22,809 --> 01:15:25,687
-I tried.
-Oh, stop.

1736
01:15:25,771 --> 01:15:27,439
It was the worst 10 minutes
of my life.

1737
01:15:27,523 --> 01:15:29,650
It felt like 10 hours.

1738
01:15:29,733 --> 01:15:30,901
Oh, I'm sorry.

1739
01:15:30,984 --> 01:15:33,362
And you know
what the worst part was?

1740
01:15:35,822 --> 01:15:38,200
He just wasn't there, you know?

1741
01:15:39,952 --> 01:15:42,412
He kept mumbling that it was,
um, the wine.

1742
01:15:42,496 --> 01:15:44,456
That, um...

1743
01:15:44,540 --> 01:15:46,792
...the rubber was too small,

1744
01:15:46,875 --> 01:15:47,918
if you can believe that.

1745
01:15:49,419 --> 01:15:52,256
And this whole time
what's clear to me

1746
01:15:52,339 --> 01:15:56,927
is that he just...
hasn't sufficiently...

1747
01:15:58,887 --> 01:16:01,223
I don't know
what the right word is. Maybe...

1748
01:16:03,308 --> 01:16:07,521
"he-just-doesn't-love-you-
enough" is the right word.

1749
01:16:07,604 --> 01:16:11,191
I mean, there's no way
around that one, is there?

1750
01:16:11,275 --> 01:16:15,195
When the girl loves the guy
with all of her heart,

1751
01:16:15,279 --> 01:16:17,573
and he just doesn't
return her feeling?

1752
01:16:19,032 --> 01:16:21,535
Do you have any idea
what that feels like?

1753
01:16:21,618 --> 01:16:24,955
"Nobody ever loved me
that much."

1754
01:16:25,038 --> 01:16:28,584
I brought into that basement
a year's worth of adoration,

1755
01:16:29,626 --> 01:16:31,587
yeah, studying his photograph,

1756
01:16:32,754 --> 01:16:34,881
memorizing his phone number.

1757
01:16:34,965 --> 01:16:38,677
And there he was,
this half-drunk junior

1758
01:16:39,928 --> 01:16:40,929
who couldn't even
pretend to love me...

1759
01:16:43,515 --> 01:16:46,602
And... I wouldn't have minded
if there'd been...

1760
01:16:47,894 --> 01:16:50,230
some... passion underneath.

1761
01:16:50,314 --> 01:16:52,608
Or even empathy.

1762
01:16:54,359 --> 01:16:57,863
There was nothing.

1763
01:16:57,946 --> 01:17:01,617
Just... that lamp
with the horses on it.

1764
01:17:02,909 --> 01:17:07,039
You deserve
so much better.

1765
01:17:07,122 --> 01:17:08,248
Yeah.

1766
01:17:10,417 --> 01:17:12,753
I asked my roommate about it
the next morning,

1767
01:17:12,836 --> 01:17:14,630
you know, girl to girl.

1768
01:17:16,006 --> 01:17:18,300
She said that men
sometimes can't perform

1769
01:17:18,383 --> 01:17:20,469
because they're too nervous.

1770
01:17:23,555 --> 01:17:24,931
I wish I could believe that

1771
01:17:25,015 --> 01:17:26,475
to feel a little bit better
about myself.

1772
01:17:26,558 --> 01:17:28,560
But...

1773
01:17:28,644 --> 01:17:31,355
...he was not nervous.
Not in the least.

1774
01:17:31,438 --> 01:17:33,231
He had his eyes shut.

1775
01:17:33,315 --> 01:17:35,734
As if he were trying to dream me
into somebody he really wanted.

1776
01:17:35,817 --> 01:17:37,736
I felt stupid.

1777
01:17:37,819 --> 01:17:39,321
I felt debased.

1778
01:17:39,404 --> 01:17:41,907
I felt furious at myself
that I could allow him

1779
01:17:41,990 --> 01:17:44,660
to make me feel
so worthless.

1780
01:17:46,244 --> 01:17:48,288
We tried
a few creative alternatives.

1781
01:17:48,372 --> 01:17:49,873
Oh, no.

1782
01:17:51,458 --> 01:17:54,753
It got uglier and uglier.

1783
01:17:54,836 --> 01:17:58,674
Finally, he said, "Elizabeth,
I owe you a rain check."

1784
01:18:00,759 --> 01:18:02,594
And that...

1785
01:18:02,678 --> 01:18:04,721
That was my 20th birthday.

1786
01:18:06,139 --> 01:18:07,391
Ta-da.

1787
01:18:07,474 --> 01:18:08,684
Jesus wept.

1788
01:18:11,395 --> 01:18:12,688
But it gets worse.

1789
01:18:12,771 --> 01:18:13,939
I don't think I can take it.

1790
01:18:14,022 --> 01:18:15,482
Okay, I can take it.

1791
01:18:15,565 --> 01:18:17,067
But just tell me in a way

1792
01:18:17,150 --> 01:18:19,569
that doesn't make me ashamed
to be a human being.

1793
01:18:21,822 --> 01:18:22,739
That's going to be difficult.

1794
01:18:24,491 --> 01:18:26,952
About a week later...

1795
01:18:27,035 --> 01:18:28,704
...everybody's leaving
for Thanksgiving.

1796
01:18:30,038 --> 01:18:31,581
He gives me a call.

1797
01:18:31,665 --> 01:18:33,625
Would I like
to have dinner with him?

1798
01:18:33,709 --> 01:18:36,420
You know me. No pride.

1799
01:18:36,503 --> 01:18:40,090
I say, "Sure," and make my way
over to his fraternity again,

1800
01:18:41,466 --> 01:18:44,761
which sits
under this huge gingko tree.

1801
01:18:44,845 --> 01:18:47,139
The leaves have turned yellow,

1802
01:18:47,222 --> 01:18:50,600
the trunk of the tree
is black from the rain.

1803
01:18:50,684 --> 01:18:53,520
I'm thinking this is the most
beautiful thing I've ever seen.

1804
01:18:54,604 --> 01:18:57,149
I remember saying to myself,

1805
01:18:57,232 --> 01:18:58,900
"God is giving you
a second chance."

1806
01:19:00,026 --> 01:19:01,486
We go up to his room,

1807
01:19:01,570 --> 01:19:03,613
his roommate has already left
for the holiday.

1808
01:19:04,531 --> 01:19:05,741
The door clicks shut,

1809
01:19:07,033 --> 01:19:07,868
and suddenly...

1810
01:19:09,536 --> 01:19:12,205
there's no more discussion
about dinner.

1811
01:19:12,289 --> 01:19:14,166
Rain check cashed!

1812
01:19:14,249 --> 01:19:15,625
In spades.

1813
01:19:15,709 --> 01:19:17,377
I mean, it's suddenly pouring.

1814
01:19:17,461 --> 01:19:19,546
We're practically tearing
each other's clothes off.

1815
01:19:19,629 --> 01:19:21,256
There is no conversation.

1816
01:19:22,299 --> 01:19:23,425
And this time...

1817
01:19:24,885 --> 01:19:26,386
there is no difficulty.

1818
01:19:27,721 --> 01:19:30,891
Not the first time.
Not the second time.

1819
01:19:30,974 --> 01:19:32,434
Stop it.

1820
01:19:34,394 --> 01:19:36,521
He says to me,

1821
01:19:36,605 --> 01:19:38,231
"Happy belated birthday,
Elizabeth."

1822
01:19:38,315 --> 01:19:39,399
Mmm.

1823
01:19:41,151 --> 01:19:42,694
And you want to hear
the unbelievable ending

1824
01:19:42,778 --> 01:19:44,946
to this sordid little story?

1825
01:19:46,948 --> 01:19:48,575
That was the last time
I saw him.

1826
01:19:50,827 --> 01:19:53,789
That was November.
Over four months ago.

1827
01:19:55,540 --> 01:19:57,667
I was absolutely sure he'd call.

1828
01:19:57,751 --> 01:19:59,586
If only
to have sex again, right?

1829
01:19:59,669 --> 01:20:01,797
No. Never.

1830
01:20:02,672 --> 01:20:04,424
I thought he'd write.

1831
01:20:04,508 --> 01:20:06,510
No.

1832
01:20:06,593 --> 01:20:08,136
So I call him, of course.

1833
01:20:08,220 --> 01:20:09,596
Mmm.

1834
01:20:09,679 --> 01:20:11,139
He couldn't get off the phone
fast enough.

1835
01:20:12,766 --> 01:20:14,142
So I wrote to him.

1836
01:20:15,769 --> 01:20:17,020
A four-page typed letter.

1837
01:20:17,103 --> 01:20:18,313
-Single-spaced.
-Oh, no.

1838
01:20:18,396 --> 01:20:20,482
No response.

1839
01:20:20,565 --> 01:20:25,487
I tell myself it was like
a fever dream, you know?

1840
01:20:25,570 --> 01:20:27,656
And maybe the fever
finally broke.

1841
01:20:28,990 --> 01:20:31,827
And it all sounds
sane and sensible.

1842
01:20:34,287 --> 01:20:35,622
But you know something?

1843
01:20:37,290 --> 01:20:40,669
If he called me right now,
right this very second,

1844
01:20:42,128 --> 01:20:44,005
I'd drop everything in my life
and...

1845
01:20:45,340 --> 01:20:47,509
drive three hours,
drive 30 hours

1846
01:20:47,592 --> 01:20:49,719
just to spend
one more night with him.

1847
01:20:49,803 --> 01:20:51,680
What is the matter
with me, Larry?

1848
01:20:51,763 --> 01:20:53,515
Why would you drive 30 hours

1849
01:20:53,598 --> 01:20:55,475
to see someone
who treated you like that?

1850
01:20:58,562 --> 01:21:00,021
Because I'm in love with him?

1851
01:21:01,273 --> 01:21:03,275
You are?

1852
01:21:03,358 --> 01:21:07,988
It's illogical.
Obsessional. Pathetic.

1853
01:21:08,071 --> 01:21:09,865
And this is not the first time
this has happened to me.

1854
01:21:11,366 --> 01:21:12,826
It keeps happening to me.

1855
01:21:14,744 --> 01:21:16,872
I feel like I can't
see people clearly.

1856
01:21:18,415 --> 01:21:21,334
I wrote a song once, years ago,

1857
01:21:21,418 --> 01:21:23,545
called The Heart is Quicker
Than the Eye.

1858
01:21:23,628 --> 01:21:25,797
It's not a great song,
but it's a good title.

1859
01:21:25,881 --> 01:21:28,967
And it's true, I think.

1860
01:21:29,050 --> 01:21:34,598
The head has nothing to do
with the madness of love.

1861
01:21:34,681 --> 01:21:37,350
And...

1862
01:21:37,434 --> 01:21:40,937
It doesn't matter at all
about worthiness, does it?

1863
01:21:41,021 --> 01:21:44,441
We invest our hearts
in worthless stocks.

1864
01:21:44,524 --> 01:21:46,776
And we know they're worthless.

1865
01:21:46,860 --> 01:21:49,070
But we cling to them
like little children

1866
01:21:49,154 --> 01:21:51,531
clutching their little
stuffed bears.

1867
01:21:51,615 --> 01:21:54,492
Oh, Elizabeth.

1868
01:21:56,995 --> 01:21:58,121
Tell me truthfully.

1869
01:22:00,332 --> 01:22:01,791
How do you feel about me?

1870
01:22:05,128 --> 01:22:06,087
How do you mean?

1871
01:22:07,339 --> 01:22:08,298
I mean,

1872
01:22:09,466 --> 01:22:10,717
at the lake house,

1873
01:22:10,800 --> 01:22:12,594
with the light
burning off the water,

1874
01:22:14,304 --> 01:22:16,139
we talked
through half the night,

1875
01:22:17,515 --> 01:22:20,185
and I touched your shoulder...

1876
01:22:20,268 --> 01:22:22,604
Did you actually love me
a little bit that night?

1877
01:22:23,897 --> 01:22:25,482
You know I love you, Larry.

1878
01:22:28,193 --> 01:22:29,277
You do?

1879
01:22:32,739 --> 01:22:35,951
Just... not that way.

1880
01:22:44,250 --> 01:22:48,004
You said you'd drive 30 hours
to see Cooper.

1881
01:22:49,631 --> 01:22:52,884
How many hours would you drive
to see me?

1882
01:22:52,968 --> 01:22:55,512
Oh.
My hands are shaking.

1883
01:22:57,347 --> 01:22:59,808
I feel something wiser
and deeper for you.

1884
01:22:59,891 --> 01:23:02,227
-Mmm. Thank you.
-Respect.

1885
01:23:02,310 --> 01:23:04,729
Gratitude for the generosity
and selflessness

1886
01:23:04,813 --> 01:23:06,356
you've shown me.

1887
01:23:06,439 --> 01:23:07,774
No one has ever been
more interested in my life

1888
01:23:07,857 --> 01:23:09,150
than you have.

1889
01:23:09,234 --> 01:23:11,277
I don't deserve
a friendship like yours.

1890
01:23:11,361 --> 01:23:12,821
I am so grateful for you.

1891
01:23:12,904 --> 01:23:15,198
I will be grateful forever.

1892
01:23:15,281 --> 01:23:17,784
I'm grateful to you, too,
for resurrecting me.

1893
01:23:17,867 --> 01:23:19,411
Stop.

1894
01:23:19,494 --> 01:23:20,704
Larry!
There's people out here.

1895
01:23:20,787 --> 01:23:22,080
One second!

1896
01:23:27,419 --> 01:23:30,547
Can I ask you something?

1897
01:23:30,630 --> 01:23:33,049
Something that's probably
too personal for me to ask?

1898
01:23:33,133 --> 01:23:36,177
Too personal is the only thing
that I'm interested in.

1899
01:23:36,970 --> 01:23:40,515
Uh... My mother...

1900
01:23:40,598 --> 01:23:41,683
You know,
she works for the Guild,

1901
01:23:41,766 --> 01:23:43,685
she knows everybody.

1902
01:23:43,768 --> 01:23:46,521
So she saw us spending time
together last summer...

1903
01:23:46,604 --> 01:23:49,691
I see where this is headed.

1904
01:23:49,774 --> 01:23:52,861
She said to me... I don't...
I don't know how to say this.

1905
01:23:52,944 --> 01:23:54,029
Just say it.

1906
01:23:56,322 --> 01:23:57,115
Okay.

1907
01:23:58,867 --> 01:24:00,869
She said to me, more than once,

1908
01:24:00,952 --> 01:24:04,706
"Elizabeth,
not only is he twice your age,

1909
01:24:04,789 --> 01:24:08,668
"but I don't think
his primary interest is women."

1910
01:24:08,752 --> 01:24:11,004
What did you say?

1911
01:24:11,087 --> 01:24:13,465
I said, "Look, Mother,
I know what I know.

1912
01:24:13,548 --> 01:24:15,175
"And I know what
we're both feeling."

1913
01:24:15,258 --> 01:24:17,093
Mmm-hmm.
What are we both feeling?

1914
01:24:21,639 --> 01:24:23,099
"Irrational adoration?"

1915
01:24:25,393 --> 01:24:28,229
And what may I ask
does your mother think

1916
01:24:28,313 --> 01:24:30,440
she knows
of my primary interest?

1917
01:24:31,816 --> 01:24:34,319
I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have said anything.

1918
01:24:35,320 --> 01:24:36,321
Please forgive me.

1919
01:24:37,822 --> 01:24:40,116
To all our mothers.

1920
01:24:40,200 --> 01:24:43,953
May they remain
mercifully silent.

1921
01:24:44,037 --> 01:24:46,289
I apologize. That was stupid
of me to have asked.

1922
01:24:46,372 --> 01:24:49,084
And I do know what I know,
and what I feel.

1923
01:24:49,167 --> 01:24:51,127
Here's what you tell
that mother of yours,

1924
01:24:51,211 --> 01:24:52,837
as she sits by the fire,

1925
01:24:52,921 --> 01:24:55,799
wistfully counting up
her royalties from Oklahoma!

1926
01:24:55,882 --> 01:24:59,302
You tell her that Larry Hart
is drunk with beauty.

1927
01:25:00,595 --> 01:25:03,223
And italicize the word "drunk."

1928
01:25:03,306 --> 01:25:05,975
Drunk with beauty,
wherever he finds it.

1929
01:25:06,059 --> 01:25:10,522
In men, in women,
in the smell of cigar stores,

1930
01:25:10,605 --> 01:25:15,360
in the impossible beauty
of a 20-year-old poet

1931
01:25:15,443 --> 01:25:17,362
with pale green eyes

1932
01:25:17,445 --> 01:25:20,115
and two tiny freckles
on her left cheek.

1933
01:25:24,869 --> 01:25:26,037
Are you all right?

1934
01:25:27,038 --> 01:25:29,666
It's...

1935
01:25:29,749 --> 01:25:31,668
...my cigarette heart.

1936
01:25:31,751 --> 01:25:33,920
Larry, Dick Rodgers
is looking for his coat.

1937
01:25:34,003 --> 01:25:35,130
Coming.

1938
01:25:52,105 --> 01:25:53,398
Introduce me?

1939
01:25:53,481 --> 01:25:56,568
Thank you, Renee.

1940
01:25:56,651 --> 01:25:59,404
Wonderful, thank you so much.

1941
01:25:59,487 --> 01:26:02,365
Dick, I want to introduce you
to my protégé,

1942
01:26:02,448 --> 01:26:03,575
Elizabeth Weiland.

1943
01:26:05,034 --> 01:26:06,161
Your protégé?

1944
01:26:07,078 --> 01:26:08,705
-Hello.
-Hello.

1945
01:26:08,788 --> 01:26:11,124
Well, you've got yourself
a damn good role model there

1946
01:26:11,207 --> 01:26:13,710
if you can stay away
from the bourbon.

1947
01:26:13,793 --> 01:26:18,214
Mmm. She's interested in writing
and set design and costumes.

1948
01:26:18,298 --> 01:26:19,799
Okay, really?

1949
01:26:19,883 --> 01:26:22,635
Mr. Rodgers, the show tonight,

1950
01:26:22,719 --> 01:26:24,220
I thought it was magnificent.

1951
01:26:24,304 --> 01:26:25,763
Well, thank you.

1952
01:26:25,847 --> 01:26:27,765
It was as perfect a musical show
as I've ever seen.

1953
01:26:27,849 --> 01:26:30,268
Well, that's
a lovely compliment.

1954
01:26:30,351 --> 01:26:32,437
Your mother's
with the Guild, am I right?

1955
01:26:32,520 --> 01:26:34,689
-Yes, Theresa Weiland.
-Yeah, Theresa, yeah.

1956
01:26:34,772 --> 01:26:36,399
Right, so you've seen
a lot of shows.

1957
01:26:36,482 --> 01:26:39,360
Too many shows.

1958
01:26:39,444 --> 01:26:40,445
Yeah.

1959
01:26:40,528 --> 01:26:41,988
I know what you mean.

1960
01:26:42,071 --> 01:26:43,406
But tonight what I saw was

1961
01:26:43,489 --> 01:26:44,908
what I'd always hoped
a show might be.

1962
01:26:44,991 --> 01:26:47,785
Uplifting. Smart. Magical.

1963
01:26:47,869 --> 01:26:50,079
Larry, this is the most
perceptive young woman

1964
01:26:50,163 --> 01:26:51,164
you've ever introduced me to.

1965
01:26:52,790 --> 01:26:54,209
-I've had a good teacher.
-Mmm-hmm.

1966
01:26:55,084 --> 01:26:56,794
So, what do you write?

1967
01:26:56,878 --> 01:26:58,880
At this point, poetry mostly.

1968
01:26:58,963 --> 01:27:01,049
It's very strong.

1969
01:27:01,132 --> 01:27:02,842
And you do set design, too?

1970
01:27:02,926 --> 01:27:04,427
-I'm studying.
-Right.

1971
01:27:04,510 --> 01:27:08,348
Well, I'd love to...
read some of your poems.

1972
01:27:08,431 --> 01:27:10,934
Uh... See your sketches.
This is my...

1973
01:27:11,017 --> 01:27:13,228
This is my private number.

1974
01:27:14,854 --> 01:27:16,856
I'm flattered.

1975
01:27:16,940 --> 01:27:20,318
I haven't seen Dorothy around.
Is... Is... Is your wife here?

1976
01:27:20,401 --> 01:27:21,444
No, she's headed back
to the apartment.

1977
01:27:21,527 --> 01:27:22,737
We're all going to meet up there

1978
01:27:22,820 --> 01:27:24,572
to look at the late reviews,
Larry.

1979
01:27:24,656 --> 01:27:28,117
Yeah, so I'd love for you
to join us, Elizabeth.

1980
01:27:28,201 --> 01:27:29,494
It would be refreshing
to have someone

1981
01:27:29,577 --> 01:27:30,995
of the younger generation
amongst us.

1982
01:27:31,079 --> 01:27:33,122
And maybe you can
explain to me, Elizabeth,

1983
01:27:33,206 --> 01:27:36,084
why exactly the young girls
scream over Sinatra.

1984
01:27:36,167 --> 01:27:38,086
I don't scream over Sinatra.

1985
01:27:38,169 --> 01:27:39,963
No, she screams under Sinatra.

1986
01:27:40,046 --> 01:27:41,798
Okay, Larry!

1987
01:27:43,549 --> 01:27:45,677
Larry, of course,
you're welcome to come.

1988
01:27:45,760 --> 01:27:47,220
Oh, I'm going to try to make it,

1989
01:27:47,303 --> 01:27:49,472
I'm just throwing a little
soirée over at my place.

1990
01:27:49,555 --> 01:27:51,182
I've got the Golden Gate Quartet
coming...

1991
01:27:51,266 --> 01:27:54,769
Well, I can't compete with Larry
in the soirée department.

1992
01:27:54,852 --> 01:27:56,980
-I'd love to stop over.
-You would?

1993
01:27:57,063 --> 01:27:58,523
Dick, you coming?

1994
01:27:58,606 --> 01:27:59,941
Yep, yep.

1995
01:28:00,024 --> 01:28:01,442
Do you have a ride?

1996
01:28:01,526 --> 01:28:03,111
You know what,
I can take her in a cab later.

1997
01:28:03,194 --> 01:28:04,737
We're going right now
if you want to come with us?

1998
01:28:04,821 --> 01:28:06,281
-I'd love to.
-Great.

1999
01:28:07,240 --> 01:28:09,575
Just let me inform my mom.

2000
01:28:09,659 --> 01:28:11,411
The dutiful daughter.

2001
01:28:14,414 --> 01:28:17,458
Wow. She is...
She is so lovely, right?

2002
01:28:18,835 --> 01:28:20,712
She's really striking.

2003
01:28:20,795 --> 01:28:23,172
Are you... Are you and she...

2004
01:28:23,256 --> 01:28:27,552
Oh, no, no.
I mean, I'm in love with her,

2005
01:28:27,635 --> 01:28:30,346
but, uh,
everybody's in love with her.

2006
01:28:31,806 --> 01:28:33,558
Just not that way.

2007
01:28:33,641 --> 01:28:34,475
Okay.

2008
01:28:38,771 --> 01:28:39,731
Hmm.

2009
01:28:44,402 --> 01:28:45,820
So we'll see you
later on tonight?

2010
01:28:45,903 --> 01:28:47,071
Absolutely.

2011
01:28:49,073 --> 01:28:50,533
Mmm-hmm.

2012
01:28:51,701 --> 01:28:52,744
Hmm.

2013
01:28:54,203 --> 01:28:55,330
Thank you for everything.

2014
01:28:57,040 --> 01:28:58,833
Mr. Rodgers.

2015
01:28:58,916 --> 01:29:00,084
Miss Weiland.

2016
01:29:02,086 --> 01:29:04,047
Thank you.

2017
01:29:04,130 --> 01:29:05,340
And we'll see you later,
Larry, right?

2018
01:29:09,260 --> 01:29:13,056
"With a song in my heart,
I behold your adorable face!"

2019
01:29:35,620 --> 01:29:38,831
You ever meet someone,
and you know instantly

2020
01:29:38,915 --> 01:29:40,458
that both your lives

2021
01:29:40,541 --> 01:29:43,211
are going to be
irretrievably altered?

2022
01:29:43,294 --> 01:29:47,006
Just as I suspected.
You are a sentimentalist.

2023
01:29:49,217 --> 01:29:50,259
When do you get off work?

2024
01:29:50,343 --> 01:29:52,053
I got to lock this joint up.

2025
01:29:52,136 --> 01:29:54,722
Ah, what about you, Knuckles,
you're done here, right?

2026
01:29:54,806 --> 01:29:56,516
Not yet.

2027
01:29:56,599 --> 01:29:58,643
Oh, 'cause I am throwing
an enormous party

2028
01:29:58,726 --> 01:29:59,852
at my place tonight.

2029
01:30:03,189 --> 01:30:04,816
I forgot to give her
the presents.

2030
01:30:08,236 --> 01:30:10,488
I'm having such trouble
with sleeves recently.

2031
01:30:10,571 --> 01:30:13,616
I have arthritis
in this shoulder.

2032
01:30:13,699 --> 01:30:16,077
I'm going to have to start
wearing a cloak.

2033
01:30:16,160 --> 01:30:18,121
I mean it. Single-handedly,

2034
01:30:18,204 --> 01:30:19,914
I'm going to bring back
the cloak.

2035
01:30:25,378 --> 01:30:30,508
You're going to see me
on opening nights with a top hat

2036
01:30:30,591 --> 01:30:33,678
and a cloak,
flitting through the fog

2037
01:30:33,761 --> 01:30:36,139
with a silver-tipped cane.

2038
01:30:36,222 --> 01:30:38,433
You boys are
coming tonight, right?

2039
01:30:38,516 --> 01:30:42,061
She's going to be there.
I'm telling you, she will.

2040
01:30:42,145 --> 01:30:43,396
She'll arrive late.

2041
01:30:43,479 --> 01:30:45,022
And get this,

2042
01:30:45,106 --> 01:30:47,692
'cause this
is the remarkable part,

2043
01:30:47,775 --> 01:30:51,279
sometime late,
maybe around 5:00 a.m.,

2044
01:30:51,362 --> 01:30:53,698
after a little too much Malbec,

2045
01:30:53,781 --> 01:30:56,909
she's going to turn to me
and say,

2046
01:30:56,993 --> 01:31:00,163
"Hey, Larry,
what are you reading?

2047
01:31:00,246 --> 01:31:02,457
"Hey, Larry,
when's your birthday?"

2048
01:31:02,540 --> 01:31:05,334
For the first time in her life,

2049
01:31:05,418 --> 01:31:09,964
she's going to be
interested in me.

2050
01:31:10,047 --> 01:31:12,383
It has to happen sometime,
right?

2051
01:31:12,467 --> 01:31:14,552
All the other guys
have disappointed her.

2052
01:31:14,635 --> 01:31:18,681
But I never will. I'm just...

2053
01:31:18,764 --> 01:31:21,100
a little touch of Larry
in the night.

2054
01:31:22,768 --> 01:31:25,229
Knuckles. Some travelin' music.

2055
01:31:29,775 --> 01:31:30,610
♪ Blue moon ♪

2056
01:31:33,154 --> 01:31:36,365
♪ You saw me standing alone ♪

2057
01:31:37,033 --> 01:31:38,201
Wise guy.

2058
01:31:38,284 --> 01:31:41,370
♪ Without a dream in my heart ♪

2059
01:31:43,122 --> 01:31:46,000
♪ Without a love of my own ♪

2060
01:31:47,418 --> 01:31:49,170

2061
01:31:49,253 --> 01:31:52,423

2062
01:31:52,507 --> 01:31:55,760
Larry, you coming uptown
to Dick's with us?

2063
01:31:55,843 --> 01:31:59,222

Larry, I think this
is the beginning

2079
01:32:47,270 --> 01:32:49,230
of a beautiful friendship.

2080
01:32:49,313 --> 01:32:50,565
"Isn't it romantic?"

2081
01:32:51,607 --> 01:32:52,608
Not really, no.

2082
01:32:56,862 --> 01:32:58,281
You know, it wasn't even

2083
01:32:58,364 --> 01:33:00,283
supposed to be
called Blue Moon.

2084
01:33:00,366 --> 01:33:03,869
I called it The Bad
in Every Man.

2085
01:33:03,953 --> 01:33:06,706
We wrote it for this movie,
Manhattan Melodrama.

2086
01:33:06,789 --> 01:33:08,583
Jack Robbins,
formerly "Rabinowitz,"

2087
01:33:08,666 --> 01:33:10,710
he had his name circumcised
over at MGM,

2088
01:33:10,793 --> 01:33:12,461
he hears the song,
he calls us into his office,

2089
01:33:12,545 --> 01:33:14,297
he lowers his pastrami, says...

2090
01:33:14,380 --> 01:33:17,425
"Dick, I love the melody.

2091
01:33:17,508 --> 01:33:20,011
"Strong as anything
you've ever written.

2092
01:33:20,094 --> 01:33:24,307
"But Larry, those words,
they're too artsy-fartsy!

2093
01:33:24,390 --> 01:33:25,891
"They're not too
artsy-fartsy for me.

2094
01:33:25,975 --> 01:33:27,935
"I know how brilliant
you guys are.

2095
01:33:28,019 --> 01:33:30,396
"But you have to write
for the schmucks in the dark.

2096
01:33:30,479 --> 01:33:32,023
"Nobody's going
to sing that lyric."

2097
01:33:32,106 --> 01:33:33,816
So I said,
"What's wrong with it?"

2098
01:33:33,899 --> 01:33:34,817
He said...
"I can't even

2099
01:33:34,900 --> 01:33:36,694
"remember the fucking title!

2100
01:33:36,777 --> 01:33:39,447
"Boys, give me
something I can promote."

2101
01:33:39,530 --> 01:33:40,698
So I say,

2102
01:33:40,781 --> 01:33:41,866
"What do you want me
to call it?"

2103
01:33:41,949 --> 01:33:43,200
Blue Moon?

2104
01:33:43,284 --> 01:33:45,828
Punchline, biggest hit
we ever wrote.
