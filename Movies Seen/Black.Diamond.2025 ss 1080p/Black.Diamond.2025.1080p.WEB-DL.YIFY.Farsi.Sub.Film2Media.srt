[Jesse] <i>Around here,</i>
<i>you're either a guy like me,</i>

00:00:53,721 --> 00:00:56,156

5
00:00:58,158 --> 00:01:00,562
<i>It's pretty much</i>

6
00:01:00,595 --> 00:01:03,798
<i>Regardless, we all share</i>

7
00:01:03,831 --> 00:01:06,634

<i>So it is rare for one of us</i>

16
00:01:36,196 --> 00:01:37,532
<i>and what I'm about to do.</i>

17
00:01:49,343 --> 00:01:51,478
It's fire mitigation.

18
00:01:51,512 --> 00:01:52,814
Keeps the place
from burnin' down.

[swelling music playing]

20
00:02:13,801 --> 00:02:15,703
Well, this is it.

21
00:02:18,773 --> 00:02:20,140
In case you need
anything fixed.

22
00:02:22,476 --> 00:02:24,646
I'll get that bag for you.

23
00:02:24,679 --> 00:02:26,380
Thank you.

24
00:02:31,418 --> 00:02:33,253
[Spencer] There she is.

-This is for you.
-Oh.

28
00:02:39,694 --> 00:02:42,964
And I think that
is for you, too.

29
00:02:42,997 --> 00:02:44,599
I'm sorry about this.

30
00:02:44,632 --> 00:02:46,534
Oh, it's fine.

31
00:02:46,567 --> 00:02:47,835
So, what else do you think?

32
00:02:47,869 --> 00:02:49,469
I was right.

33
00:02:49,504 --> 00:02:50,872
You do belong here
on a mountain with me.

-[chuckling]
-What's the damage, mate?

35
00:02:53,675 --> 00:02:55,208
Oh, uh, 75.

36
00:02:56,511 --> 00:02:58,245
-Just take that.
-Thank you.

37
00:02:58,278 --> 00:02:59,714
Hey, the guy who bought
this place from,

38
00:02:59,747 --> 00:03:01,649
he was a doctor, I think.

39
00:03:01,683 --> 00:03:03,551
Yeah, he was.
How'd you know that?

40
00:03:03,584 --> 00:03:06,420
I put in that hot tub
a couple years ago.

41
00:03:06,453 --> 00:03:07,989
Needed you last week.

42
00:03:08,022 --> 00:03:09,891
Well, anything breaks,
you need something fixed.

43
00:03:09,924 --> 00:03:11,726
He can fix it.

44
00:03:11,759 --> 00:03:13,861
It's what it says on
his business card.

45
00:03:13,895 --> 00:03:16,698
Oh, I see. Cool.

46
00:03:16,731 --> 00:03:18,666
-Thank you.
-My pleasure.
Take care, you guys.

47
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:19,967
-See ya.
-You, too.

48
00:03:21,401 --> 00:03:23,236
Didn't you say
this was a cabin?

49
00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:25,773
-It is. It's made of logs.
-[laughs]

50
00:03:25,807 --> 00:03:27,809
Unless you want
something smaller, of course.
It can be arranged. I mean--

51
00:03:27,842 --> 00:03:30,343
Oh, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no. I think
this will do just fine.

52
00:03:30,377 --> 00:03:31,779
Uh-huh?

53
00:03:35,616 --> 00:03:36,984
Welcome.

54
00:03:37,018 --> 00:03:38,953
All right.
Let's leave this over here.

55
00:03:38,986 --> 00:03:40,621
Come on in.

56
00:03:58,806 --> 00:04:00,675
Where did you
get all this stuff?

57
00:04:00,708 --> 00:04:02,543
From the previous owner.

58
00:04:02,577 --> 00:04:04,612
He wasn't gonna need all
this shit in West Palm Beach.

59
00:04:04,645 --> 00:04:06,547
And to be fair,
it did me a favor,

60
00:04:06,581 --> 00:04:09,282
saved me gettin' a decorator
to do exactly the same thing.

61
00:04:09,316 --> 00:04:10,350
It's pretty cool, huh?

62
00:04:11,052 --> 00:04:12,285
I'd say so.

63
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:13,386
Yeah.

64
00:04:16,423 --> 00:04:17,457
Hmm.

65
00:04:18,860 --> 00:04:22,362
That did not come
with the house.

66
00:04:22,395 --> 00:04:24,397
That did not.

67
00:04:24,431 --> 00:04:27,068
That old princess
arrived two days ago.

68
00:04:27,101 --> 00:04:30,037
He did it around
41 at his peak.

69
00:04:34,441 --> 00:04:37,310
Am I supposed
to know who he is?

70
00:04:37,344 --> 00:04:38,980
Come on.

71
00:04:39,013 --> 00:04:40,615
Picasso.

72
00:04:40,648 --> 00:04:42,583
Close, close.

73
00:04:42,617 --> 00:04:43,918
The other Spaniard.

74
00:04:46,386 --> 00:04:47,855
-[champagne pops]
-Wooh!

75
00:04:55,663 --> 00:04:57,565
You know, it's been so weird
here on my own

76
00:04:57,598 --> 00:04:59,399
for the past two weeks.

77
00:04:59,432 --> 00:05:01,736
It gets really quiet out
there, especially at night.

78
00:05:03,004 --> 00:05:06,073
One starts to feel like a 21st
century Jeremiah Johnson.

79
00:05:07,008 --> 00:05:08,576
Sorry.

80
00:05:08,609 --> 00:05:10,745
But it's this old Redford movie,

81
00:05:10,778 --> 00:05:12,880
and I only saw it myself for
the first time the other night,

82
00:05:12,914 --> 00:05:16,349
but basically he plays
this, um, mountain man

83
00:05:16,383 --> 00:05:18,986
that gets besieged
by Indians with painted faces.

84
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:21,122
Look, I'm not sayin'
we're besieged yet,

85
00:05:21,155 --> 00:05:23,925
but my point is he chose
to be a mountain man,

86
00:05:23,958 --> 00:05:28,361
just like we've
chosen to be here.

87
00:05:28,395 --> 00:05:29,496
It's war paint.

88
00:05:31,165 --> 00:05:32,967
I have some in me, you know?

89
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,068
Native.

90
00:05:35,870 --> 00:05:37,905
And I've got some
terrorist in me.

91
00:05:37,939 --> 00:05:39,640
What does that tell you?

92
00:05:39,674 --> 00:05:41,609
Spencer and Elena
ain't nothin' to fuck with.

93
00:05:41,642 --> 00:05:44,111
[both chuckle]

94
00:05:49,851 --> 00:05:51,719
-[Spencer] <i>Wait.</i>
-[Elena] <i>Okay.</i>

95
00:05:51,752 --> 00:05:53,154
Right. How does that feel?

96
00:05:53,187 --> 00:05:54,989
Okay.

97
00:05:59,827 --> 00:06:02,096
I don't know.
How is it supposed to feel?

98
00:06:02,129 --> 00:06:04,364
Well, you certainly look like
you know what you're doing.

99
00:06:10,104 --> 00:06:12,439
You've been waiting long, mate?

100
00:06:12,472 --> 00:06:14,008
Few minutes, no worries.

101
00:06:14,041 --> 00:06:16,911

102
00:06:16,944 --> 00:06:19,479
So, listen.

103
00:06:19,513 --> 00:06:22,950
She's never skied before,
but I need her to ski with me.

104
00:06:22,984 --> 00:06:24,785
How good are you?

105
00:06:24,819 --> 00:06:26,153
I'm magnificent.

106
00:06:26,187 --> 00:06:28,789
[upbeat music playing]

107
00:07:02,990 --> 00:07:04,926
Oh, man, this is so annoying.
Feel that.

108
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:06,193
What's wrong?

109
00:07:06,227 --> 00:07:07,561
Does that feel hot to you?

110
00:07:07,595 --> 00:07:08,663
Feel it.

111
00:07:11,498 --> 00:07:12,633
Warm enough.

112
00:07:12,667 --> 00:07:14,502
Ah!

113
00:07:14,535 --> 00:07:17,571
Should be fucking scalding
for what I just paid for it.

114
00:07:17,605 --> 00:07:18,906
[Spencer grunts]

115
00:07:18,940 --> 00:07:20,574
Where are you going?

116
00:07:20,608 --> 00:07:22,843
To call the fuckin'
idiots that fixed it.

117
00:07:22,877 --> 00:07:24,477
Actually, call that driver.

118
00:07:24,512 --> 00:07:26,113
He fitted the fucking
thing, didn't he?

119
00:07:26,147 --> 00:07:27,848
He installed this.

120
00:07:27,882 --> 00:07:29,583
Can you call him?
I need to call New York.

121
00:07:29,617 --> 00:07:31,118
Something tells me they're
fucking up as well.

122
00:07:36,924 --> 00:07:38,693
[Spencer]
How many?

123
00:07:38,726 --> 00:07:40,194
I'll tell you what.

124
00:07:40,227 --> 00:07:42,263
If I make the call for you,

125
00:07:42,296 --> 00:07:44,565
I'm gonna need some
serious reciprocity.

126
00:07:46,067 --> 00:07:47,501
Okay, well, just do it.

127
00:07:49,670 --> 00:07:51,539
All right.

128
00:07:51,572 --> 00:07:52,740
Yeah.

129
00:07:53,641 --> 00:07:55,109
Hey.

130
00:07:55,142 --> 00:07:57,244
I just came around the side.
I hope that's all right.

131
00:07:57,278 --> 00:07:59,947
Oh, yeah.
It's fine.

132
00:07:59,981 --> 00:08:01,182
So, what's the problem?

133
00:08:01,215 --> 00:08:02,917
Hello again. Spencer.

134
00:08:02,950 --> 00:08:03,985
Jesse.

135
00:08:04,018 --> 00:08:05,119
Over here.

136
00:08:05,152 --> 00:08:06,821
So, uh, I paid a couple of guys

137
00:08:06,854 --> 00:08:08,589
who promised me
they'd fix this thing.

138
00:08:08,622 --> 00:08:10,091
Have a feel.

139
00:08:10,124 --> 00:08:11,192
Oh, yeah.

140
00:08:11,225 --> 00:08:12,760
You think you can do it?

141
00:08:12,793 --> 00:08:13,894
I'll figure it out.

142
00:08:13,928 --> 00:08:14,962
All right. Now, do me a favor.

143
00:08:14,996 --> 00:08:16,797
If you can't, just say so.

144
00:08:16,831 --> 00:08:19,800
I'll still pay you
for your time.

145
00:08:19,834 --> 00:08:21,268
Hello?

146
00:08:30,711 --> 00:08:34,515
[munching]

147
00:08:35,316 --> 00:08:36,851
Oh, shit.

148
00:08:36,884 --> 00:08:38,686
I think our cowboy's
lookin' a bit perplexed.

149
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:40,688
Could be how he
looks in general.

150
00:08:40,721 --> 00:08:41,756
-[phone vibrating]
-Mm-mm.

151
00:08:41,789 --> 00:08:42,857
I've gotta take this.

152
00:08:42,890 --> 00:08:43,924
[grunts]

153
00:08:43,958 --> 00:08:45,259
Yeah.

154
00:08:45,292 --> 00:08:46,894
I told you not to say that, man.

155
00:08:50,097 --> 00:08:52,033
-Hey.
-Hey.

156
00:08:53,734 --> 00:08:55,036
You wanna do me a favor?

157
00:09:05,679 --> 00:09:07,681
You know, it's
freezing out here!

158
00:09:07,715 --> 00:09:09,250
Uh, just keep your eye
on that peak.

159
00:09:09,283 --> 00:09:12,019
It'll hypnotize you
and you will not feel the cold.

160
00:09:16,157 --> 00:09:17,725
All right.

161
00:09:17,758 --> 00:09:19,260
Can you check that jet?
Is it gettin' hotter?

162
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:27,168
I think so.

163
00:09:27,201 --> 00:09:28,702
Yeah.

164
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:00,701
How's the pressure?

165
00:10:02,069 --> 00:10:03,804
It's gettin' stronger.

166
00:10:07,241 --> 00:10:09,043
What's the J stand for?

167
00:10:10,778 --> 00:10:12,213
It's James, right?

168
00:10:12,246 --> 00:10:14,048
Dad liked outlaws.

169
00:10:14,081 --> 00:10:16,050
Thought he was one.

170
00:10:16,083 --> 00:10:18,719
Mostly he was just a drunk
who liked to break stuff.

171
00:10:22,056 --> 00:10:23,157
How we doing?

172
00:10:23,190 --> 00:10:25,192
He fixed it.

173
00:10:25,226 --> 00:10:26,727
What was the problem?

174
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:28,863
Pump was clogged.
I unclogged it.

175
00:10:28,896 --> 00:10:31,432
Wow! You would not
believe how much it cost
me to get two experts

176
00:10:31,465 --> 00:10:34,034
to not unclog my fucking pump.

177
00:10:34,068 --> 00:10:35,336
I bet I would.

178
00:10:35,369 --> 00:10:37,071
I'm only gonna
charge you 150, though.

179
00:10:37,104 --> 00:10:38,706
Mostly for bein'
out in the cold.

180
00:10:39,306 --> 00:10:40,774
What do I get?

181
00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:44,812
[Spencer]
What else can you fix?

182
00:10:44,845 --> 00:10:45,946
[Jesse]
Well, I can replace
those rotting boards

183
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:47,047
on the deck out there.

184
00:10:47,081 --> 00:10:48,315
I didn't even notice that.

185
00:10:48,349 --> 00:10:50,184
Yeah.

186
00:10:50,217 --> 00:10:51,919
Now, I fixed a bunch of
stuff for the previous owner.

187
00:10:51,952 --> 00:10:53,888
Just pretty much looks the same.

188
00:10:53,921 --> 00:10:56,190
Oh, yeah.

189
00:10:56,223 --> 00:10:58,726
Except for that.

190
00:10:58,759 --> 00:10:59,827
[Jesse] Is that real?

191
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:01,395
[Spencer] Of course it is.

192
00:11:01,428 --> 00:11:02,730
Is it all right if I...

193
00:11:02,763 --> 00:11:03,931
Yeah, be my guest?

194
00:11:07,268 --> 00:11:10,237
I've never seen
one in person before.

195
00:11:10,271 --> 00:11:12,206
-It's a Moreau, right?
-Ding, ding.

196
00:11:12,239 --> 00:11:13,374
[chuckles]

197
00:11:13,407 --> 00:11:15,176
I took art class
back in college.

198
00:11:15,209 --> 00:11:17,011
Oh, you went to college, huh?

199
00:11:17,044 --> 00:11:20,014
Oh, community college
in Weatherford, Texas.

200
00:11:20,047 --> 00:11:21,715
Yeah, teacher said this
bird I was drawing

201
00:11:21,749 --> 00:11:23,784
looked like the rooster
by Moreau.

202
00:11:23,817 --> 00:11:27,087
So, I went down to the bookstore
and checked him out.

203
00:11:28,389 --> 00:11:29,757
Wow.

204
00:11:32,059 --> 00:11:34,328
Who plays?

205
00:11:34,361 --> 00:11:36,197
Oh, I strum a bit.

206
00:11:36,230 --> 00:11:37,865
Not very well, though. You?

207
00:11:37,898 --> 00:11:39,400
Yeah, I strum some.

208
00:11:39,433 --> 00:11:41,802
Go on, then.
Play us something.

209
00:11:41,835 --> 00:11:43,704
All right.
[chuckles]

210
00:12:19,974 --> 00:12:22,209
-Yes! Uh-huh.
-Wooh!

211
00:12:22,243 --> 00:12:24,111
Man of many talents!

212
00:12:24,144 --> 00:12:26,880
Nah, most of us shit kickers
can do a party trick or two.

213
00:12:26,914 --> 00:12:29,450
Yeah. Now, in between your
very nimble guitar playing

214
00:12:29,483 --> 00:12:31,852
and keen eye for art,
tell me something.

215
00:12:31,885 --> 00:12:33,420
Can you fix showers?

216
00:12:33,454 --> 00:12:35,322
-I can take a look.
-This way.

217
00:12:37,324 --> 00:12:38,859
Right.

218
00:12:38,892 --> 00:12:41,395
So this one's fine,
but this one...

219
00:12:41,428 --> 00:12:42,963
How do you feel?

220
00:12:44,198 --> 00:12:45,399
-Ooh!
-Yeah.

221
00:12:45,432 --> 00:12:46,433
-Oh, yeah.
-Scalding, right?

222
00:12:46,467 --> 00:12:47,901
Yeah.

223
00:12:47,935 --> 00:12:49,403
Need a new cartridge.

224
00:12:49,436 --> 00:12:51,539
Switches your hot to hot,
your cold to cold.

225
00:12:51,573 --> 00:12:53,807
Probably just haven't
been replaced since
the house was built.

226
00:12:53,841 --> 00:12:55,409
Well, you get the cartridge
and I'll pay you back,

227
00:12:55,442 --> 00:12:56,877
and then whatever it
costs to install it.

228
00:12:56,910 --> 00:12:58,212
-Sound good?
-Mm-hmm.

229
00:12:58,245 --> 00:13:00,247
Good man. Now, tell me,
can you fix doors?

230
00:13:00,281 --> 00:13:02,016
I've got one downstairs
that needs a new lock.

231
00:13:03,050 --> 00:13:04,519
-I can take a look.
-You can do that?

232
00:13:04,552 --> 00:13:06,353
Let's go.

233
00:13:06,387 --> 00:13:08,989
So there's a guy down
the hill, a Lebanese fella.

234
00:13:09,023 --> 00:13:10,558
He wants all this done and more.

235
00:13:10,592 --> 00:13:12,359
I'm gonna give him your number,
if that's cool with you.

236
00:13:12,393 --> 00:13:13,460
Yeah, sure is.

237
00:13:13,494 --> 00:13:14,962
All right.

238
00:13:14,995 --> 00:13:17,298
Oh, yeah.
And charge him double.

239
00:13:17,331 --> 00:13:18,832
Unlike me, he likes
to overpay for things.

240
00:13:18,866 --> 00:13:20,234
[Spencer laughs]

241
00:13:20,267 --> 00:13:23,437
Hey, thank you for
helping me earlier.

242
00:13:23,470 --> 00:13:24,572
You're welcome.

243
00:13:24,606 --> 00:13:26,206
There you go.

244
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:28,075
Oh, thank you.

245
00:13:28,108 --> 00:13:29,310
I said 150.

246
00:13:29,343 --> 00:13:30,878
Nope, that's for
the party trick.

247
00:13:30,911 --> 00:13:33,581
Oh. Oh, thank you.

248
00:13:33,615 --> 00:13:34,915
All right.

249
00:13:34,948 --> 00:13:36,584
All right, take care.

250
00:13:39,219 --> 00:13:42,189
Very useful cowboy.

251
00:13:42,222 --> 00:13:45,459
He's the first local I've met
that isn't a complete bellend.

252
00:13:45,492 --> 00:13:47,928
I didn't know who painted that.

253
00:13:47,961 --> 00:13:49,296
Does that make me a bellend?

254
00:13:49,330 --> 00:13:50,931
Furthest thing from, baby.

255
00:13:50,964 --> 00:13:52,399
He did know who it was though,

256
00:13:52,433 --> 00:13:54,168
and he knew his way
around the guitar,

257
00:13:54,201 --> 00:13:56,103
that's for sure.

258
00:13:56,136 --> 00:13:58,205
We can all play something
as country folk.

259
00:13:58,238 --> 00:14:01,208
Oh, yeah, I forgot
you're one of them.

260
00:14:01,241 --> 00:14:05,379
So tell me, what can you play?

261
00:14:05,412 --> 00:14:07,981
Hmm?

262
00:14:08,015 --> 00:14:10,417
You know, I think he
likes you, our cowboy.

263
00:14:11,919 --> 00:14:14,988
[Spencer]
Well, I am very likeable.

264
00:14:17,224 --> 00:14:18,892
I think all the men around
here have got

265
00:14:18,926 --> 00:14:20,494
that hungry look in their eyes.

266
00:14:22,129 --> 00:14:25,132
[Elena]
Should we feed them?

267
00:14:26,601 --> 00:14:30,170
Yeah, I think we should.

268
00:15:31,331 --> 00:15:33,535
How much do you
think I nicked it for?

269
00:15:33,568 --> 00:15:36,036
I don't know, 2 mil.

270
00:15:36,069 --> 00:15:39,039
I don't wanna be nicking it,
it's probably worth that much.

271
00:15:39,072 --> 00:15:43,310
No, I swapped it for a Hockney
that I didn't really love.

272
00:15:43,343 --> 00:15:45,479
And guess who
got the better deal?

273
00:15:45,513 --> 00:15:47,582
[chuckles]

274
00:15:47,615 --> 00:15:50,451
Don't you have to
sell it first to know?

275
00:15:50,484 --> 00:15:53,621
Ah, sometimes just know.

276
00:15:54,689 --> 00:15:55,989
Hmm.

277
00:16:21,683 --> 00:16:23,083
[Spencer] Yeah.

278
00:16:25,152 --> 00:16:27,154
Good, you spoke to them.

279
00:16:27,187 --> 00:16:28,322
What'd they say?

280
00:16:28,355 --> 00:16:30,324
[phone dings]

281
00:16:30,357 --> 00:16:31,992

[tense music]

283
00:17:01,823 --> 00:17:04,091
You've got to be
fucking kidding me.

284
00:17:12,132 --> 00:17:13,801
No, no, no, no,
you know what I'm gonna do?

285
00:17:13,835 --> 00:17:15,737
I'm gonna fly to LA
today myself,

286
00:17:15,770 --> 00:17:17,739
and I'm gonna show you
how to close these royal twats

287
00:17:17,772 --> 00:17:20,407
once and for all,
and then you will
fucking thank me.

That son of a bitch said this is
a fuckin' one-day job!

292
00:17:39,627 --> 00:17:41,596
Fuck it is, dude,
it's a three-day job.

293
00:17:41,629 --> 00:17:42,830
I'm not fucking going
to doing this.

294
00:17:42,864 --> 00:17:44,131
Jesus.

295
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:48,135
Oh, well, hello there.

Hello!

Hey there.

You lost?

300
00:17:57,712 --> 00:18:00,247
Come on over.

301
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:02,182
Hey, come on now, we don't bite!

302
00:18:02,215 --> 00:18:04,384
Not much, anyway.

303
00:18:07,622 --> 00:18:10,424
Are you telling me I'm
gonna have to fly commercial?

304
00:18:10,457 --> 00:18:11,893
Good, because
I'm not doing that!

305
00:18:11,926 --> 00:18:13,728
I don't know, Gary,
I'm not a fucking pilot.

306
00:18:13,761 --> 00:18:16,598
Just do your job, man, or
I'll find someone who can.

307
00:18:16,631 --> 00:18:17,899
-Hey, baby.
-Hey.

308
00:18:17,932 --> 00:18:19,333
How was your walk?

309
00:18:19,366 --> 00:18:22,770
Uh, you know, cold, beautiful.

310
00:18:22,804 --> 00:18:24,606
-What's goin' on?
-Bad news.

311
00:18:24,639 --> 00:18:27,709
I've got to go to LA,
see a man about a dog.

312

What?

313
00:18:29,510 --> 00:18:31,679
That must be
a very special dog.

314
00:18:31,713 --> 00:18:33,447
Not really, an expensive one.

315
00:18:34,949 --> 00:18:36,450
About half a billion.

316
00:18:39,854 --> 00:18:42,189
Why don't you come with me?
I'll only be gone a day or two.

You probably sell that
somewhere, I bet.

357
00:21:24,519 --> 00:21:26,053
I do.

358
00:21:26,087 --> 00:21:27,688
I, um, did.

359
00:21:29,422 --> 00:21:32,527
Just a few restaurants
and bakeries in New York.

360
00:21:34,427 --> 00:21:35,763
No real money in it, though.

361
00:21:37,131 --> 00:21:39,000
No real money in
anything these days.

362
00:21:39,033 --> 00:21:40,333
[Jesse chuckles]

363
00:21:40,367 --> 00:21:41,736
Except one thing.

364
00:21:43,905 --> 00:21:45,006
Where's the money?

365
00:21:46,674 --> 00:21:48,475
Dating rich guys, stupid.

366
00:21:56,684 --> 00:21:58,351
Now, you're easy to miss

367
00:21:58,385 --> 00:22:00,655
till you take those stupid
sunglasses off.

368
00:22:00,688 --> 00:22:03,624
[chuckles]

369
00:22:03,658 --> 00:22:05,458
But you don't miss
much, do you?

370
00:22:08,062 --> 00:22:09,831
Not when I'm payin' attention.

371
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:14,869
Where'd you grow up, anyway?

372
00:22:18,405 --> 00:22:19,574
Doesn't matter.

373
00:22:20,908 --> 00:22:22,610
Must be from the same place.

374
00:22:22,643 --> 00:22:23,744
[chuckles]

375
00:22:23,778 --> 00:22:25,412
Bet you don't go back much.

376
00:22:27,148 --> 00:22:29,083
Once.

377
00:22:29,116 --> 00:22:30,483
That was enough.

378
00:22:53,908 --> 00:22:55,109
Still too early for you?

379
00:22:55,142 --> 00:22:57,444
Oh, that's not for me.

380
00:22:57,477 --> 00:23:00,781
Believe me, it was,
but, uh, not anymore.

381
00:23:02,750 --> 00:23:04,118
More for me, then.

382
00:23:07,922 --> 00:23:09,422
You said he's in town.

383
00:23:10,892 --> 00:23:12,526
Grand Junction.

384
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:14,629
Went to see a guy about a dog.

385
00:23:14,662 --> 00:23:16,097
Y'all gettin' a dog, huh?

386
00:23:16,130 --> 00:23:17,565
Hmm.

387
00:23:19,133 --> 00:23:21,135
He's allergic.

388
00:23:21,168 --> 00:23:25,172
I think it's just a saying,
you know, from, uh...

389
00:23:25,206 --> 00:23:26,473
-[both] England.
-Yeah.

390
00:23:26,507 --> 00:23:29,476
[Jesse chuckles]

391
00:23:37,518 --> 00:23:38,819
So you draw, huh?

392
00:23:40,821 --> 00:23:43,456
I scribble some.

393
00:23:43,490 --> 00:23:46,160
You scribble some,
you strum some, too.

394
00:23:46,193 --> 00:23:47,862
That's me.

395
00:23:47,895 --> 00:23:49,530
A little bit of this,
a little bit of that,

396
00:23:49,563 --> 00:23:52,533
not enough for either one.

397
00:23:52,566 --> 00:23:54,669
Just enough for the ladies,
though, right?

398
00:24:00,007 --> 00:24:01,208
No lady?

399
00:24:02,543 --> 00:24:04,477
Nothing serious.

400
00:24:04,512 --> 00:24:06,681
What about you?

401
00:24:06,714 --> 00:24:09,482
I mean, where's the ring?

402
00:24:09,517 --> 00:24:11,619
That's where
the real money is, right?

403
00:24:14,088 --> 00:24:15,790
My mother always said,

404
00:24:15,823 --> 00:24:17,992
"Don't get married,
don't have kids,

405
00:24:18,025 --> 00:24:19,860
and if you're dumb enough
to do either one,

406
00:24:19,894 --> 00:24:22,563
you better have a plan to kill
that son of a bitch."

407
00:24:22,596 --> 00:24:23,631
Smart woman.

408
00:24:23,664 --> 00:24:25,599
[chuckles]

409
00:24:25,633 --> 00:24:29,570
Spencer always says
the money's everywhere.

410
00:24:29,603 --> 00:24:31,138
You just need to know
how to grab it

411
00:24:31,172 --> 00:24:33,207
when no one's lookin'.

412
00:24:34,308 --> 00:24:37,078
Or when everybody is.

413
00:24:37,111 --> 00:24:39,580
They all say that shit,
don't they?

414
00:24:39,613 --> 00:24:42,049
He's all right, though,
compared to most of 'em.

415
00:24:43,684 --> 00:24:45,152
Most of them are dogs.

416
00:24:47,621 --> 00:24:49,557
Spencer is more like a cat,

417
00:24:51,292 --> 00:24:53,127
playing with the mouse

418
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:55,629
before neatly tearing it up
and eating the good parts.

419
00:24:58,666 --> 00:25:01,669
You just make sure
when the time comes,

420
00:25:03,070 --> 00:25:04,939
you walk out with more
than you walked in with.

421
00:25:06,841 --> 00:25:08,576
And hold on to your good parts.

422
00:25:11,712 --> 00:25:13,114
You do the same.

423
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:21,622
Here's to gettin' it.

424
00:25:46,147 --> 00:25:50,251
[kissing]

425
00:25:52,086 --> 00:25:55,256
[panting]

426
00:26:06,967 --> 00:26:08,669
[moans]

427
00:26:08,702 --> 00:26:12,039
[panting]

428
00:26:57,985 --> 00:26:59,186
For the road.

429
00:27:01,255 --> 00:27:02,289
Just once, huh?

430
00:27:03,791 --> 00:27:05,159
Once was enough.

431
00:27:48,836 --> 00:27:51,338
Hey, baby.

432
00:27:51,372 --> 00:27:54,141
-You miss me?
-Oh, I did.

433
00:27:54,175 --> 00:27:56,210
-Oh, gosh.
-Oh.

434
00:27:56,243 --> 00:27:57,912
-[sighs]
-[kissing]

435
00:27:57,945 --> 00:28:00,247
You were right.
I should have come with you.

436
00:28:00,281 --> 00:28:01,949
How was your meeting?

437
00:28:01,982 --> 00:28:05,920
Well, the money's en route,
as they say.

438
00:28:05,953 --> 00:28:07,788
[kisses]
Good.

439
00:28:07,821 --> 00:28:08,956
Yeah.

440
00:28:08,989 --> 00:28:10,124
You hungry?

441
00:28:10,157 --> 00:28:11,458
Yeah, I could do
with some food.

442
00:28:11,492 --> 00:28:14,428
Good.
I'll, uh, fix something up.

443
00:28:24,104 --> 00:28:25,906
-Baby?
-Yeah?

444
00:28:25,940 --> 00:28:28,409
Did the cowboy come and
fix that door downstairs?

445
00:28:29,544 --> 00:28:31,278
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, he did.

446
00:28:31,312 --> 00:28:32,780
I forgot to tell
you he's coming.

447
00:28:32,813 --> 00:28:34,949
What about the lower deck?

448
00:28:34,982 --> 00:28:37,051
Oh, uh, yeah.

449
00:28:37,084 --> 00:28:38,419
I'm-- I'm not sure.

450
00:28:55,903 --> 00:28:57,805
So someone's been
drinking on the job?

451
00:28:59,139 --> 00:29:00,841
Oh.

452
00:29:00,874 --> 00:29:03,177
Yeah, I had a beer,
so I offered him one, too.

453
00:29:04,411 --> 00:29:06,247
Oh, that's generous of you.

454
00:29:09,216 --> 00:29:10,451
You know, baby,
we gotta be careful

455
00:29:10,484 --> 00:29:12,086
not to confuse the help.

456
00:29:13,420 --> 00:29:14,488
Okay.

457
00:29:16,423 --> 00:29:17,992
Eat. It's gettin' cold.

458
00:29:20,361 --> 00:29:22,463
[radio]

459
00:29:22,496 --> 00:29:24,098

Hey!

468
00:29:52,192 --> 00:29:54,461
There's some coyotes
yippin' out there.

469
00:29:54,495 --> 00:29:57,498
They get kinda hungry
and mean this time of the year.

470
00:29:57,532 --> 00:29:59,233
Just a heads up.

471
00:30:11,345 --> 00:30:12,880
[knocking]

472
00:30:12,913 --> 00:30:14,549
Baby, a friend
of mine is in town.

473
00:30:14,582 --> 00:30:16,016
Well, he's a colleague, really.

474
00:30:16,050 --> 00:30:17,619
-He's coming over.
-Okay.

475
00:30:17,652 --> 00:30:20,054
-Around 4:00?
-Okay.

476
00:30:20,087 --> 00:30:22,923
You couldn't whip up a cheese
plate or something, could you?

477
00:30:22,956 --> 00:30:26,126
Um, sure. Yeah.

478
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:27,227
Cool.

479
00:30:28,395 --> 00:30:29,930
Are you gonna close that door?

480
00:30:29,963 --> 00:30:32,433
You're letting
all the steam out.

481
00:30:39,940 --> 00:30:41,942
Cowboy, can you come over?

482
00:30:41,975 --> 00:30:43,444
Boiler's actin' up.

483
00:30:43,477 --> 00:30:45,012
Cheers.

484
00:30:48,516 --> 00:30:50,417
Ah, cowboy!

485
00:30:50,451 --> 00:30:52,119
Glad you're here. Come on in.

486
00:30:52,152 --> 00:30:54,288
Baby, look who's here.

487
00:30:56,357 --> 00:30:58,158
So I've, uh, got some
friends coming over.

488
00:30:58,192 --> 00:31:00,027
-Can you smell that?
-No.

489
00:31:00,060 --> 00:31:01,395
Yeah, see, every time
I go down there,

490
00:31:01,428 --> 00:31:04,098
I get the faint smell of shit.

491
00:31:04,131 --> 00:31:05,232
Come on.

492
00:31:05,265 --> 00:31:06,634
It's your sump pump.

493
00:31:06,668 --> 00:31:08,369
Yeah, probably.

494
00:31:11,539 --> 00:31:13,240
[sniffs]

495
00:31:13,273 --> 00:31:15,042
Now can you smell it?

496
00:31:15,075 --> 00:31:16,076
No.

497
00:31:16,110 --> 00:31:17,311
I can.

498
00:31:24,519 --> 00:31:26,387
Yeah.

499
00:31:26,420 --> 00:31:28,422
When that happens, you just got
to pour water down that pumper.

500
00:31:29,957 --> 00:31:31,091
Well, you do that.

501
00:31:31,125 --> 00:31:32,560
I'm gonna let my friends in.

502
00:31:35,062 --> 00:31:37,699
Hey!
[laughing]

503
00:31:37,732 --> 00:31:39,433
-Tomas!
-Hey. How's it goin', man?

504
00:31:39,466 --> 00:31:41,068
-Good to see you.
-Oh, this place is amazing!

505
00:31:41,101 --> 00:31:42,436
Thank you.
Thank you very much.

506
00:31:42,469 --> 00:31:43,671
And, uh, Ginny, right?

507
00:31:43,705 --> 00:31:45,072
Jenette, actually.

508
00:31:45,105 --> 00:31:46,641
But everyone calls me Jen.

509
00:31:46,674 --> 00:31:48,275
Except me.
Please, come in.

510
00:31:48,308 --> 00:31:50,043
-Come in, come in, come in.
-Yeah.

511
00:31:50,077 --> 00:31:51,311
That's the one you like, right?

512
00:31:51,345 --> 00:31:52,580
It certainly is.

513
00:31:52,614 --> 00:31:53,715
Thank you very much.
Thank you.

514
00:31:53,748 --> 00:31:55,115
Your house is fucking massive.

515
00:31:55,149 --> 00:31:56,584
Trust me, this is pretty quaint

516
00:31:56,618 --> 00:31:58,318
compared to some of
the others around here.

517
00:31:58,352 --> 00:32:00,187
Our pump was actin' up.

518
00:32:00,220 --> 00:32:02,089
Jesse, when you're done here,
come upstairs, will you?

519
00:32:03,591 --> 00:32:05,426
Most able fellow I've met here.

520
00:32:11,766 --> 00:32:14,334
Ah, Elena, darling.
Tomas and Jen.

521
00:32:14,368 --> 00:32:16,003
-Hi.
-Hello.

522
00:32:16,036 --> 00:32:17,371
-Tomas.
-Elena.

523
00:32:17,404 --> 00:32:19,206
-Nice to meet you.
-Jen.

524
00:32:19,239 --> 00:32:20,642
-Pleasure.
-Jen, darling, what
can I get you?

525
00:32:20,675 --> 00:32:21,676
-Whiskey?
-I'll have what she's having.

526
00:32:21,709 --> 00:32:23,076
-Prosecco.
-Cool.

527
00:32:23,110 --> 00:32:24,512
-I love this.
-Thank you.

528
00:32:24,546 --> 00:32:26,146
This is quite a room.

529
00:32:26,180 --> 00:32:27,582
Ah, yeah.

530
00:32:27,615 --> 00:32:29,717
Most of this is from
the previous owner.

531
00:32:29,751 --> 00:32:33,353
Why swap out great cowboy
and Indian shit for
less great, huh?

532
00:32:33,387 --> 00:32:35,155
No, it's perfect.

533
00:32:35,189 --> 00:32:36,624
So is that.

534
00:32:36,658 --> 00:32:38,258
It's a Kandinsky, no?

535
00:32:40,093 --> 00:32:42,996
No, mate. Try, uh, Moreau.

536
00:32:43,030 --> 00:32:44,331
-...skiing so much--
-There we go, ladies.

537
00:32:44,364 --> 00:32:46,033
-Oh, thank you.
-Thank you.

538
00:32:46,066 --> 00:32:47,602
So how much?

539
00:32:47,635 --> 00:32:49,671
Uh, I bought it off some, uh,

540
00:32:49,704 --> 00:32:51,739
bohemian artist
living in the village.

541
00:32:51,773 --> 00:32:53,474
Some Jewish fella,
him and his wife.

542
00:32:53,508 --> 00:32:55,275
He was a-- he was a painter.

543
00:32:55,309 --> 00:32:59,246
His stuff was shit,
but he had that sitting there.

544
00:32:59,279 --> 00:33:01,381
I'm going to hate you. How much?

545
00:33:02,517 --> 00:33:03,618
Half a million.

546
00:33:03,651 --> 00:33:05,052
It's worth two.

547
00:33:05,085 --> 00:33:06,688
-Cheers.
-Fuck.

548
00:33:06,721 --> 00:33:08,055
Is that all or...

549
00:33:08,088 --> 00:33:09,557
Ah, Jesse.

550
00:33:09,591 --> 00:33:10,692
-Stay for a bit.
-Um...

551
00:33:10,725 --> 00:33:12,059
No, no, no.

552
00:33:12,092 --> 00:33:14,294
You're staying. For one.

553
00:33:17,832 --> 00:33:20,635
She looks like fun
to play house with.

554
00:33:20,668 --> 00:33:23,805
She is, but I think
we're past playing.

555
00:33:23,838 --> 00:33:25,172
A bit more Prosecco?

556
00:33:25,205 --> 00:33:26,708
Isn't that right, baby?

557
00:33:26,741 --> 00:33:28,510
-What's that?
-Me and you.

558
00:33:28,543 --> 00:33:29,777
We're past playing.

559
00:33:31,478 --> 00:33:32,446
Never.

560
00:33:32,479 --> 00:33:33,748

561
00:33:33,781 --> 00:33:35,449
[Spencer]
Take it from one who didn't.

562
00:33:35,482 --> 00:33:38,185
Get a solid prenup,
and you're all good, my friend.

563
00:33:38,218 --> 00:33:40,120
The truth is, since bein'
out here,

564
00:33:40,153 --> 00:33:42,624
that whole world seems
so far away.

565
00:33:42,657 --> 00:33:44,626
There's something
real here, man.

566
00:33:44,659 --> 00:33:47,795
People can do things, not
just talk people into things.

567
00:33:47,829 --> 00:33:50,598
This guy over here,
he can fix anything.

568
00:33:50,632 --> 00:33:54,234
He knew that was a Moreau,
knows his way around a guitar.

569
00:33:54,268 --> 00:33:56,236
Ain't that right, cowboy?

570
00:33:56,270 --> 00:33:57,539
Sorry?

571
00:33:57,572 --> 00:33:59,072
I was just telling
my friend here

572
00:33:59,106 --> 00:34:00,775
what a fine guitar
player you are.

573
00:34:00,808 --> 00:34:03,076
Oh, no, I'm not.

574
00:34:03,110 --> 00:34:04,846
You gonna play us something?

575
00:34:04,879 --> 00:34:06,614
-No, I cannot play--
-Yes, you are.

576
00:34:06,648 --> 00:34:08,282
Just imagine we're all
sittin' around a campfire,

577
00:34:08,315 --> 00:34:10,284
one of the guys
has got a guitar.

578
00:34:10,317 --> 00:34:12,687
Yes. Let's do it. Come on.

580
00:34:25,900 --> 00:34:27,669
Not that shit.

581
00:34:27,702 --> 00:34:29,737
As skillful as it was,
I want something different.

[music ends]

594
00:35:32,299 --> 00:35:35,235
And that's how we do
it around the campfire.

595
00:35:37,204 --> 00:35:39,741
That's too high of a note
for me not to leave on, so...

596
00:35:39,774 --> 00:35:41,408
No encore?

597
00:35:41,441 --> 00:35:43,878
I've always been kind
of a one-and-doner.

598
00:35:43,911 --> 00:35:46,814
Ah, who knows when to say when?
Wish I did.

599
00:35:46,848 --> 00:35:48,616
Oh, appreciate you guys
letting me have a drink,

600
00:35:48,650 --> 00:35:51,385
and, uh, it's nice meeting
you folks.

601
00:35:51,418 --> 00:35:53,387
Don't forget that
cartridge thingy.

602
00:35:53,420 --> 00:35:54,856
That's comin'.

603
00:35:54,889 --> 00:35:56,490
Thanks for having me over.

604
00:35:56,524 --> 00:35:58,492
-Mm.
-Good night.

605
00:35:59,594 --> 00:36:01,194
That was quite good.

606
00:36:01,228 --> 00:36:02,797
Hmm.

607
00:36:02,830 --> 00:36:04,666
Rather inspired performance,
don't you think, babe?

608
00:36:04,699 --> 00:36:06,199
Mm-hmm.

609
00:36:06,233 --> 00:36:08,636
Mm-hmm.

610
00:36:08,670 --> 00:36:10,303
Anyone hungry?

611
00:36:11,438 --> 00:36:12,607
Okay.

612
00:36:14,776 --> 00:36:16,276
So, what did you think of him?

613
00:36:17,979 --> 00:36:19,881
I mean, he's all right.

614
00:36:19,914 --> 00:36:22,784
He's just a bit of a grasper.

615
00:36:22,817 --> 00:36:23,951
I noticed.

616
00:36:23,985 --> 00:36:25,419
Of course you did.

617
00:36:26,754 --> 00:36:28,455
He can never quite
make the big score.

618
00:36:28,488 --> 00:36:29,991
I mean, he sees it,
don't get me wrong,

619
00:36:30,024 --> 00:36:31,793
just doesn't know
how to grab it.

620
00:36:31,826 --> 00:36:33,961
Which is why he's stayin'
in a pretty solid hotel in town

621
00:36:33,995 --> 00:36:35,697
and not-- you know?

622
00:36:35,730 --> 00:36:37,598
Well, I'm sure you could teach
him how to grab

623
00:36:37,632 --> 00:36:39,499
rather than grasp.

624
00:36:39,534 --> 00:36:41,703
Yeah, I probably could,
but I fucking won't.

626
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:47,374

We're gonna take
a bath together,

628

Hmm.

632
00:36:56,718 --> 00:36:58,485
And then I'll let you fix me?

633
00:36:58,519 --> 00:37:00,722

like I plan to--

Mm.

You know how
much I love that word.

You don't gotta worry,
you know?

He's smart enough to suspect,

656
00:40:28,796 --> 00:40:31,799
but too arrogant to think
I'd ever fuck the help.

657
00:40:31,832 --> 00:40:33,734

works in both of our favor.

like this again,

00:44:50,291 --> 00:44:51,458
I can come back if you want.

715
00:44:51,492 --> 00:44:53,327
No. No.

716
00:44:53,360 --> 00:44:55,829
We can fix it now.

717
00:44:55,863 --> 00:44:57,198
Yeah.

718
00:45:16,483 --> 00:45:20,454
So your song the other day,
went something like this.

719
00:45:35,302 --> 00:45:37,338
It's really nice. I like it.

720
00:45:37,371 --> 00:45:39,974
It's very, um, simple.

721
00:45:40,007 --> 00:45:42,510
But I was thinking

722
00:45:42,544 --> 00:45:44,211
maybe you could add
something like this.

723
00:45:55,489 --> 00:45:58,092
Something like that.
At the end.

724
00:45:58,125 --> 00:46:00,794
It's a trick my Chilean
teacher taught me.

725
00:46:00,828 --> 00:46:02,129
You try it.

726
00:46:02,162 --> 00:46:04,765
Here. Come on.

727
00:46:15,109 --> 00:46:17,579
No, no, no, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no.

728
00:46:17,612 --> 00:46:19,380
[sighs]

729
00:46:22,082 --> 00:46:23,384
You play good.

730
00:46:23,417 --> 00:46:25,386
Thank you.

731
00:46:25,419 --> 00:46:28,122
I hope you didn't think this
thing was just for decoration.

732
00:46:28,155 --> 00:46:29,890
I can't stand people like that.

733
00:46:29,923 --> 00:46:31,458
I mean, I've always
been an excellent student.

734
00:46:31,492 --> 00:46:33,193
I've never had any
trouble gettin' As

735
00:46:33,227 --> 00:46:36,930
or firsts at university,
but, I mean,

736
00:46:36,964 --> 00:46:40,968
I could never give myself to
something completely, you know?

737
00:46:41,001 --> 00:46:45,172
I never had it here
to be an artist.

738
00:46:45,205 --> 00:46:47,074
I had to make money.
I had to.

739
00:46:47,107 --> 00:46:50,077
You know, I didn't grow up posh
like the rest of my classmates.

740
00:46:50,110 --> 00:46:52,980
My dad was from a place
called Lahore.

741
00:46:53,013 --> 00:46:55,082
That's in Pakistan.

742
00:46:55,115 --> 00:46:58,152
Yeah, I figured you were
from, you know,

743
00:46:58,185 --> 00:47:00,321
one of those places.

744
00:47:00,354 --> 00:47:02,122
One of those places, yeah.

745
00:47:02,156 --> 00:47:03,991
India, Yemen, Pakistan,

746
00:47:04,024 --> 00:47:06,126
where they've all got different
shades of brown skin

747
00:47:06,160 --> 00:47:08,462
and they pray on their
knees to Allah!

748
00:47:08,495 --> 00:47:10,364
Allah pak!
[chuckles]

749
00:47:10,397 --> 00:47:12,366
You ever been to one
of those places, Jesse?

750
00:47:12,399 --> 00:47:14,201
I guess I haven't.

751
00:47:14,234 --> 00:47:17,905
Neither have I, except from
the safety of the Four Seasons.

752
00:47:17,938 --> 00:47:19,940
But I have been to places like
the London School of Economics

753
00:47:19,973 --> 00:47:21,576
and Harvard Business School.

754
00:47:21,609 --> 00:47:23,545
They're very interesting places.

755
00:47:23,578 --> 00:47:25,379
Bit boring.

756
00:47:25,412 --> 00:47:27,381
And tad vicious.

757
00:47:27,414 --> 00:47:28,849
I bet.

758
00:47:30,951 --> 00:47:34,355
So you and, uh, Elena,
you met in New York?

759
00:47:34,388 --> 00:47:36,624
Well, I didn't meet
her at Harvard, did I?

760
00:47:36,658 --> 00:47:40,260
Not being rude, but there's
no one there like Elena.

761
00:47:40,294 --> 00:47:42,930
She's a rare breed
anywhere, that one.

762
00:47:42,963 --> 00:47:45,633
You take her to a party, never
looks like she's having fun.

763
00:47:45,667 --> 00:47:49,069
Doesn't wanna get involved
with any of the party girls.

764
00:47:49,103 --> 00:47:50,471
But do you know
what that makes her

765
00:47:50,505 --> 00:47:52,507
to blokes like us?

766
00:47:56,511 --> 00:47:58,078
I think she doesn't know.

767
00:47:59,514 --> 00:48:01,248
She knows everything.

768
00:48:03,417 --> 00:48:04,952
But I really like that.

769
00:48:08,389 --> 00:48:10,090
What about you, cowboy?

770
00:48:10,124 --> 00:48:12,993
Do you like that?

771
00:48:13,026 --> 00:48:14,629
-I don't know.
-Of course you do.

772
00:48:14,662 --> 00:48:17,264
You know, the first
time I met her, right,

773
00:48:17,297 --> 00:48:21,001
she was seein' this, like, blue
blood prick from J.P. Morgan.

774
00:48:21,034 --> 00:48:22,670
I knew him.

775
00:48:22,704 --> 00:48:27,174
And I thought to myself,
"How the fuck did he get her?"

776
00:48:27,207 --> 00:48:30,110
The next time I saw her,
she was off to L.A.,

777
00:48:30,144 --> 00:48:32,012
going to see another guy.

778
00:48:32,045 --> 00:48:34,114
So I told her, "Tell him
that you can't make it,

779
00:48:34,148 --> 00:48:36,450
you got a cold, and let's
fuck off to Lisbon together."

780
00:48:36,483 --> 00:48:38,051
In Portugal.

781
00:48:38,085 --> 00:48:39,654
Last time I checked.
Well done, cowboy.

782
00:48:39,687 --> 00:48:41,288
And that's what we did.

783
00:48:41,321 --> 00:48:43,056
Felt like we fucked
off from everywhere.

784
00:48:43,090 --> 00:48:46,528
We drank some champagne,
and we joined a mile-high club.

785
00:48:46,561 --> 00:48:49,062
Oops. Sorry.

786
00:48:49,096 --> 00:48:50,732
You wanna feel that?

787
00:48:50,765 --> 00:48:52,132
I can feel that.

788
00:48:52,166 --> 00:48:53,535
-You sure?
-Mm-hmm.

789
00:48:59,607 --> 00:49:01,676
[Elena]
Spencer!

790
00:49:01,709 --> 00:49:03,611
The lights are out!

791
00:49:03,645 --> 00:49:06,480
[Spencer]
Yes, I'm here!

792
00:49:06,514 --> 00:49:08,081
Can you fix this, cowboy?

793
00:49:08,115 --> 00:49:09,349
I can take a look.

794
00:49:09,383 --> 00:49:11,018
You got a flashlight, right?

795
00:49:11,051 --> 00:49:13,287
Only on my phone,
and that's charging downstairs.

796
00:49:13,320 --> 00:49:15,422
Not anymore.

797
00:49:18,593 --> 00:49:20,762
So how long does this sort
of thing last around here?

798
00:49:20,795 --> 00:49:22,262
Could be five minutes.

799
00:49:22,296 --> 00:49:23,964
Could be five or six hours.

800
00:49:26,233 --> 00:49:27,535
Dinner's ready.

801
00:49:29,136 --> 00:49:31,506
Are you hungry, Jesse?

802
00:49:31,539 --> 00:49:33,373
Uh, I don't think
there's enough, uh--

803
00:49:33,407 --> 00:49:34,709
Of course there is.

804
00:49:34,742 --> 00:49:36,410
Take a seat.

805
00:49:42,550 --> 00:49:44,051
Looks beautiful.

806
00:49:45,085 --> 00:49:46,420
[kisses]

807
00:49:47,722 --> 00:49:49,389
This is all very exciting.

808
00:49:50,625 --> 00:49:52,092
Don't you think, guys?

809
00:49:55,630 --> 00:49:58,432
You know, I can feel it

810
00:49:58,465 --> 00:50:01,468
gettin' a little bit
cold in here already.

811
00:50:01,503 --> 00:50:04,271
Yeah, it can change
pretty quickly around here.

812
00:50:04,304 --> 00:50:06,473
You know what I think we do?

813
00:50:06,508 --> 00:50:09,209
These things
aren't on in an hour,

814
00:50:09,243 --> 00:50:10,578
we go to the hotel
up the road, and...

815
00:50:10,612 --> 00:50:12,312
[bang]

816
00:50:14,147 --> 00:50:15,717
What was that?

817
00:50:15,750 --> 00:50:18,318
You leave a door open?

818
00:50:18,352 --> 00:50:20,120
I don't think so.

819
00:50:24,626 --> 00:50:25,727
You got a gun?

820
00:50:25,760 --> 00:50:27,562
Why would I have a gun?

821
00:50:32,867 --> 00:50:34,836
Spencer.

822
00:50:34,869 --> 00:50:36,069
Stay.

823
00:50:36,103 --> 00:50:37,639
Stay there.

824
00:50:59,627 --> 00:51:00,762
[Spencer screams]

825
00:51:09,837 --> 00:51:11,104
Hold it.

826
00:51:18,813 --> 00:51:20,247
Yeah, hold it.

827
00:51:26,888 --> 00:51:28,556
It's the Picasso.

828
00:51:28,590 --> 00:51:29,724
Yeah.

829
00:51:30,490 --> 00:51:34,562
[panting]

830
00:51:38,298 --> 00:51:40,200
Hey!

831
00:51:40,233 --> 00:51:41,569
What are you doin'?

832
00:51:41,603 --> 00:51:43,303
You said we take
the painting and go.

833
00:51:43,337 --> 00:51:44,806
You do whatever you want.

834
00:51:44,839 --> 00:51:47,307
I'm gonna look around.

835
00:51:47,341 --> 00:51:49,309
See what else there is to find.

836
00:51:49,343 --> 00:51:50,812
That's fuckin' stupid, man.

837
00:51:50,845 --> 00:51:53,548
We get out of here.

838
00:51:53,581 --> 00:51:54,682

843
00:52:14,401 --> 00:52:16,571
Just stop. Shh! Shh!

844
00:52:16,604 --> 00:52:17,639
Okay.

845
00:52:17,672 --> 00:52:19,574
Okay. Shh! shh!

[both pant]

849
00:52:27,347 --> 00:52:29,517
I think we met your
guy downstairs, huh?

850
00:52:29,550 --> 00:52:32,486
Yeah. Real squirrely fuck.

851
00:52:32,520 --> 00:52:34,388
Ran out the door and left you.

852
00:52:36,423 --> 00:52:37,892
Damn it.
Get that fuckin' light off!

Yeah.

859
00:52:53,708 --> 00:52:54,809
Yeah, I remember you.

860
00:52:54,842 --> 00:52:56,476
From the forest that day.

861
00:52:58,478 --> 00:53:00,548
You remember me, too,
don't you?

862
00:53:01,716 --> 00:53:02,750
Don't you?

00:53:02,784 --> 00:53:04,986
[Barry chuckles]

00:53:05,019 --> 00:53:07,522
How much you wanna bet?

865
00:53:07,555 --> 00:53:09,724
I can wipe that look
right off your face.

866
00:53:11,993 --> 00:53:14,361
You can't afford it.

It's me. It's-- Elena! Elena.

879
00:54:00,340 --> 00:54:01,976
It's over. It's okay.

880

It's over. It's all right.

Mr. Sinclair's on his way down
to the station for questioning.

886
00:54:27,400 --> 00:54:28,770
I'm gonna post a car
up the street

for your own peace of mind.

888
00:54:30,638 --> 00:54:33,007
You know, we get burglaries
around here every now and then,

889
00:54:33,040 --> 00:54:35,610
but this is highly unusual.

890
00:54:35,643 --> 00:54:37,812
Footprints go in and out.

891
00:54:37,845 --> 00:54:39,379
Blood trail goes out.

00:54:39,412 --> 00:54:40,782
No sign of forced entry.

you were locked out?

01:08:56,571 --> 01:08:57,872
Fuck.

1073
01:09:05,278 --> 01:09:06,948
Help!

1074
01:09:06,981 --> 01:09:09,216
[Jesse panting]

1075
01:09:11,284 --> 01:09:13,353
[groaning]

1076
01:09:13,387 --> 01:09:15,657
[panting]

1077
01:09:18,826 --> 01:09:20,695
You're in some shape, mate.

1078
01:09:20,728 --> 01:09:23,296
Practically, ran up
that damn hill.

1079
01:09:23,330 --> 01:09:26,233
[panting]

1080
01:09:35,610 --> 01:09:37,377
[screams]

1081
01:09:37,411 --> 01:09:38,880
It'll help.

1082
01:09:38,913 --> 01:09:41,381
Probably the only thing
that'll help right now.

1083
01:09:44,018 --> 01:09:46,521
There you go. Oh, boy.

1084
01:09:46,554 --> 01:09:49,423
[laughs]

1085
01:09:49,456 --> 01:09:50,858
[sighs]

1086
01:09:52,794 --> 01:09:55,295
-[yells]
-Yeah, I did something similar.

1087
01:09:55,328 --> 01:09:59,332
Not quite as bad.
About 10 years ago.

1088
01:09:59,366 --> 01:10:00,968
That was it for me.

1089
01:10:01,002 --> 01:10:02,737
Probably for you, too.

1090
01:10:02,770 --> 01:10:04,872
[Spencer panting]

1091
01:10:04,906 --> 01:10:06,574
[grunts]

1092
01:10:06,607 --> 01:10:09,309
[Spencer groaning]

1093
01:10:09,342 --> 01:10:10,978
You don't deserve her.

1094
01:10:11,012 --> 01:10:13,514
And the second I saw you,
I thought, "No way,

1095
01:10:13,548 --> 01:10:15,817
not this guy."

1096
01:10:15,850 --> 01:10:18,853
I can tell you the type is
thinks everything can be yours

1097
01:10:18,886 --> 01:10:21,622
for a deal or a steal.

1098
01:10:21,656 --> 01:10:22,724
That house.

1099
01:10:22,757 --> 01:10:25,459
That painting.

1100
01:10:25,492 --> 01:10:27,895
My song.

1101
01:10:27,929 --> 01:10:29,697
A woman.

1102
01:10:29,731 --> 01:10:30,898
Fuck you.

1103
01:10:34,702 --> 01:10:35,870
You hear that?

1104
01:10:37,739 --> 01:10:39,974
Help's on the way.

1105
01:10:40,007 --> 01:10:42,777
All you gotta
do is call for it.

1106
01:10:42,810 --> 01:10:44,879
You know how to
call for help, don't you?

1107
01:10:44,912 --> 01:10:46,379
Help! Please!

1108
01:10:46,413 --> 01:10:48,015
Somebody help me!

1109
01:10:49,717 --> 01:10:51,853
[chuckles]

1110
01:10:51,886 --> 01:10:54,655
You fuckin' idiot.

1111
01:10:54,689 --> 01:10:56,758
All right.

1112
01:10:56,791 --> 01:10:59,994
Well, you hang in there.
You'll be all right.

1113
01:11:02,697 --> 01:11:03,865
Maybe.

1114
01:11:05,099 --> 01:11:06,567
[grunts]

1115
01:11:06,601 --> 01:11:09,369
[pants]

1116
01:11:09,402 --> 01:11:11,371
That's gonna be hard to prove.

1117
01:11:11,404 --> 01:11:12,573
That he was there?

1118
01:11:12,607 --> 01:11:13,975
That he sabotaged your skis

1119
01:11:14,008 --> 01:11:15,643
and that that caused
your accident.

1120
01:11:15,676 --> 01:11:18,445
And what about
an accessory to home invasion?

1121
01:11:18,478 --> 01:11:19,714
Can we prove that?

1122
01:11:19,747 --> 01:11:20,882
We have some witnesses
who saw him

1123
01:11:20,915 --> 01:11:22,583
talkin' to Teft and Aldrich

1124
01:11:22,617 --> 01:11:24,018
at a local bar a few
nights before the break-in.

1125
01:11:24,051 --> 01:11:26,486
We're gonna pick him up.

1126
01:11:26,521 --> 01:11:28,689
In the meantime,
I have an officer
posted by the ridge there.

1127
01:11:28,723 --> 01:11:30,958
Very reassuring.

1128
01:11:30,992 --> 01:11:33,027
And what about Barry Teft?

1129
01:11:33,060 --> 01:11:35,930
Are you gonna be pickin'
him up anytime soon?

1130
01:11:35,963 --> 01:11:37,497
Yes, sir.

1131
01:11:37,532 --> 01:11:38,766
I believe we will.

1132
01:11:40,400 --> 01:11:43,805
You believe you will?

1133
01:11:43,838 --> 01:11:45,773
Baby, do me a favor.
See the officer out,

1134
01:11:45,807 --> 01:11:47,875
and on your way back,
get me my gun from my closet.

1135
01:11:47,909 --> 01:11:48,976
Thanks.

1136
01:11:50,611 --> 01:11:51,679
[sighs]

1137
01:12:38,793 --> 01:12:40,061
[groans]

1138
01:13:37,652 --> 01:13:39,720
Supposed to just take
the fuckin' painting
and leave.

1139
01:13:39,754 --> 01:13:40,988
[Barry chuckles]

1140
01:13:41,022 --> 01:13:42,823
I'm the same as you.

1141
01:13:42,857 --> 01:13:44,825
When I see a piece like that,
I'm gonna jump on it.

1142
01:13:46,761 --> 01:13:48,896
I beat you to it, didn't I?

1143
01:14:04,045 --> 01:14:05,713
[gun thuds]

1144
01:14:11,552 --> 01:14:13,888
[takes deep breaths]

1145
01:14:42,249 --> 01:14:44,218
I really blew it, didn't I?

1146
01:14:47,655 --> 01:14:48,889
What?

1147
01:14:48,923 --> 01:14:50,191
My chance.

1148
01:14:51,993 --> 01:14:53,527
I was stupid.

1149
01:14:57,231 --> 01:14:58,265
[sighs]

1150
01:14:58,299 --> 01:14:59,633
No.

1151
01:15:01,569 --> 01:15:02,870
You're smart.

1152
01:15:04,572 --> 01:15:07,008
You're the smartest.

1153
01:15:07,041 --> 01:15:09,510
Just doesn't mean
much around here.

1154
01:15:11,312 --> 01:15:13,748
I'm glad you stayed with me.

1155
01:15:21,322 --> 01:15:23,024
You should get some rest.

1156
01:15:41,175 --> 01:15:43,744
Jerry, I think that maybe
Sinclair's comin' your way.

1157
01:15:43,778 --> 01:15:45,546
You might wanna
check on Paschim.

1158
01:15:48,049 --> 01:15:49,183
You copy that?

1159
01:15:51,752 --> 01:15:52,887
Jerry, you copy?

1160
01:15:55,122 --> 01:15:57,224
Jerry, you copy?

1161
01:17:01,722 --> 01:17:03,757
Look, that one
from the other night,

1162
01:17:03,791 --> 01:17:05,326
you don't gotta
worry about him.

1163
01:17:08,762 --> 01:17:11,132
They weren't supposed to...

1164
01:17:11,165 --> 01:17:12,967
They were just supposed
to take the painting.

1165
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:14,735
Yeah?

1166
01:17:14,768 --> 01:17:16,137
And then what?

1167
01:17:16,170 --> 01:17:17,271
I don't know.

1168
01:17:17,304 --> 01:17:18,672
Fence it.

1169
01:17:18,706 --> 01:17:19,773
Sell it.

1170
01:17:21,976 --> 01:17:25,279
I just figured
if I could grab it,

1171
01:17:25,312 --> 01:17:26,747
like we had said the other day,

1172
01:17:26,780 --> 01:17:28,182
then I could...

1173
01:17:28,215 --> 01:17:30,851
I could show you that...

1174
01:17:30,885 --> 01:17:32,319
...me...

1175
01:17:32,353 --> 01:17:34,321
That I could play his game.

1176
01:17:36,223 --> 01:17:38,692
You did some time, huh?

1177
01:17:42,329 --> 01:17:44,365
I'm not gonna do any more.

1178
01:17:44,398 --> 01:17:46,133
I have a dad doing time.

1179
01:17:46,167 --> 01:17:47,801
I think he's gonna die in there.

1180
01:17:47,835 --> 01:17:50,070
You think or hope?

1181
01:17:53,974 --> 01:17:55,676
Tea?

1182
01:17:57,512 --> 01:17:59,280
Yeah.

1183
01:18:05,019 --> 01:18:06,453
[sighs]

1184
01:18:08,856 --> 01:18:10,324
You look tired.

1185
01:18:10,357 --> 01:18:12,359
[chuckles]
Yeah.

1186
01:18:15,996 --> 01:18:18,165
What am I to you, anyway?

1187
01:18:18,199 --> 01:18:20,801
-Just some...
-Mistake I made?

1188
01:18:24,205 --> 01:18:26,440
It sure didn't feel
like a mistake.

1189
01:18:26,473 --> 01:18:27,875
It felt like...

1190
01:18:29,443 --> 01:18:30,844
You know what it felt like.

1191
01:18:33,047 --> 01:18:35,749
And I can tell it's
a problem for you.

1192
01:18:35,783 --> 01:18:37,184
I know you worked hard
to get here.

1193
01:18:39,153 --> 01:18:40,988
Kept yourself to yourself.

1194
01:18:41,021 --> 01:18:43,357
You didn't let him or any
of them see shit about you.

1195
01:18:44,992 --> 01:18:46,427
You had it in the bag

1196
01:18:48,462 --> 01:18:49,830
till you got lonely.

1197
01:18:51,298 --> 01:18:53,033
I mean, that's all right.

1198
01:18:53,067 --> 01:18:54,235
People do.

1199
01:18:56,036 --> 01:18:57,171
I do.

1200
01:18:59,340 --> 01:19:01,442
You know, it's hard always
pretendin' to be somethin'

1201
01:19:01,475 --> 01:19:03,511
or someone you're not.

1202
01:19:04,878 --> 01:19:07,815
Liking guys you don't.

1203
01:19:07,848 --> 01:19:09,116
No matter how
good you are at it.

1204
01:19:09,149 --> 01:19:12,486
And you are very good.

1205
01:19:13,921 --> 01:19:16,056
But even a star player has
to take himself out sometimes,

1206
01:19:16,090 --> 01:19:17,124
you know?

1207
01:19:17,157 --> 01:19:18,859
Breathe some air.

1208
01:19:20,327 --> 01:19:22,229
That's what you were
doin' when we happened.

1209
01:19:22,263 --> 01:19:24,999
Just breathing some air.

1210
01:19:28,570 --> 01:19:29,837
No mistake.

1211
01:19:35,075 --> 01:19:37,111
Oh, fuck!

1212
01:19:37,144 --> 01:19:40,414

[kissing]

1217
01:21:33,360 --> 01:21:35,996
I'm never going back.

01:21:36,029 --> 01:21:40,134
[groaning]

1219
01:21:40,167 --> 01:21:42,202
I'm sorry.

1220
01:21:42,236 --> 01:21:45,205
[panting]

1221
01:21:47,642 --> 01:21:49,109
I'm sorry.

1222
01:21:49,143 --> 01:21:51,311

1223

[groaning, panting]

1224
01:22:48,570 --> 01:22:50,270
Got you, girl.

1225
01:23:58,238 --> 01:23:59,741
You're not that bad, you know?

1226
01:24:07,114 --> 01:24:08,750
