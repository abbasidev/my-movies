We were both 14.

Whatever happens to a boy
during the summer he's 14...

..can mark him for life.

That hotel you see, the Mirana,...

..that belonged to us.

She wanted to be a nurse.

I wanted to be a spy.

All at once we were madly,
hopelessly in love.

Four months later, she died of typhus.

The shock of her death
froze something in me.

The child I loved was gone.

But I kept looking for her...

..long after I'd left
my own childhood behind.
