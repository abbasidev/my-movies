-Nine.

140
00:09:15,806 --> 00:09:17,683

00:09:17,766 --> 00:09:19,268
-What?
-Mmm.

142
00:09:19,351 --> 00:09:20,560

-Philippe Étancelin, 56 years old.

154
00:10:00,851 --> 00:10:04,480
Some people look at Sonny Hayes,

155
00:10:04,563 --> 00:10:06,607
a gambling junkie
who missed his shot.

156
00:10:06,690 --> 00:10:08,817
Wow, Ruben, you are
really selling this.

157
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:11,028

160
00:10:14,406 --> 00:10:18,035
My rookie's a phenomenal talent.
Phenomenal. But he's young.

161
00:10:18,535 --> 00:10:19,995
You know what he
lacks? Maturity.

162
00:10:20,746 --> 00:10:22,206

163
00:10:22,289 --> 00:10:24,458

-Him.

166
00:10:29,546 --> 00:10:32,132

the driver, it's the car.

170

upgrade package this weekend?

171
00:10:40,182 --> 00:10:41,976
-Six months in development...
-Ruben...

172
00:10:42,059 --> 00:10:43,185
No, no, no. Wait.

173
00:10:43,268 --> 00:10:47,481
I just need one of my cars across
the finish line first. One.

I love ya. I'm not going back.

175
00:10:54,154 --> 00:10:55,155
Okay.

176
00:10:58,658 --> 00:11:00,368
What would he want you to do?

177
00:11:02,996 --> 00:11:03,914
Join a boy band?

178
00:11:03,997 --> 00:11:05,624
Seriously. Come on.

179
00:11:07,793 --> 00:11:09,753
Seriously, I'd ask him
what he's smiling about.

180
00:11:09,836 --> 00:11:10,921
Come on.

181
00:11:11,922 --> 00:11:14,132
He's smiling at the possibility.

182
00:11:16,051 --> 00:11:17,552
We both know how that ended.

183
00:11:19,388 --> 00:11:20,389
Yep.

184
00:11:21,473 --> 00:11:22,474
Okay.

185
00:11:23,141 --> 00:11:26,520
-This is a first-class ticket to London.
-Oh, my God.

186
00:11:26,603 --> 00:11:27,813
First class.

187
00:11:27,896 --> 00:11:31,483
I'm offering you an
open seat in Formula 1.

188
00:11:32,442 --> 00:11:35,029
The only place you
could say for one day,

189
00:11:35,112 --> 00:11:40,450
if you win, you are the
absolute best in the world.

190
00:11:50,502 --> 00:11:52,337
-Hey, Ruben.
-Mmm.

191
00:11:52,879 --> 00:11:54,840
-Ever seen a miracle?
-Not yet.

192
00:11:55,465 --> 00:11:56,550
Me neither.

193
00:11:57,592 --> 00:11:58,760
Good to see you, amigo.

194
00:12:00,971 --> 00:12:02,973
-All right, sweetie, here you go.
-Thank you.

195
00:12:03,056 --> 00:12:05,350
-Mm-hmm.
-Hey, let me ask you something.

196
00:12:07,602 --> 00:12:12,107
Close friend of yours made you an
offer that was 100%, positively

197
00:12:12,190 --> 00:12:13,525
too good to be true.

198
00:12:14,484 --> 00:12:15,402
What do you do?

199
00:12:15,485 --> 00:12:18,113
Well, how much are we talking?

200
00:12:18,196 --> 00:12:19,656
Not about the money.

201
00:12:21,241 --> 00:12:22,742
So what is it about?

202
00:12:23,869 --> 00:12:24,953
Hmm.

203
00:13:06,328 --> 00:13:09,123
Tire temps look good.
Eighty-five front, 75 rear.

204
00:13:09,206 --> 00:13:11,583
-You are good to push.
-Copy.

205
00:13:20,509 --> 00:13:22,261
Battery is full. You're
good for strat two.

206
00:13:22,344 --> 00:13:23,428
Going for a lap.

207
00:13:41,196 --> 00:13:43,406
Purple sector one. Best one yet.

208
00:13:44,074 --> 00:13:45,242
Car feels good.

209
00:14:21,736 --> 00:14:22,862
Damn!

210
00:14:26,950 --> 00:14:28,952
Locked it up. Flat
spot, front left.

211
00:14:37,294 --> 00:14:38,295
Bring him in.

212
00:14:38,378 --> 00:14:39,755
Go to strat one.

213
00:14:39,838 --> 00:14:41,673
Uh, box this lap. Box this lap.

214
00:14:54,311 --> 00:14:56,813
Let's go find those gremlins.

215
00:15:33,975 --> 00:15:35,310
Sorry, Joshua.

216
00:15:38,271 --> 00:15:40,357
Jodie, try not to
kill our driver.

217
00:15:47,238 --> 00:15:48,907
What's the verdict?

218
00:15:48,990 --> 00:15:52,661
I don't know what's happening. I
mean, it feels good. I start to push.

219
00:15:53,161 --> 00:15:55,455
Then it understeers in the slow
corners and oversteers the fast.

220
00:15:55,538 --> 00:15:57,082
What? On entries or exits?

221
00:15:57,165 --> 00:15:58,792
Either. Both.

222
00:15:58,875 --> 00:16:00,168
Oh, great. Yeah.

223
00:16:00,251 --> 00:16:03,046
There's 10,000 sensors on this thing
and you can't tell me what's going on.

224
00:16:03,129 --> 00:16:04,923
But I'm not out there, am I?

225
00:16:05,006 --> 00:16:08,009
So, I-I'm gonna need your
help on this. Please.

226
00:16:24,567 --> 00:16:27,237
150 million dollar jungle gym.

227
00:16:27,862 --> 00:16:28,863
So cute.

228
00:16:29,489 --> 00:16:32,409
We should let her drive.
Can't be any worse.

229
00:16:35,495 --> 00:16:36,747
Joshua.

230
00:16:36,830 --> 00:16:39,082
-Hi.
-Lisbeth. PR?

231
00:16:39,165 --> 00:16:40,834
-Oh, yeah.
-Doesn't matter.

232
00:16:40,917 --> 00:16:43,545
For the press conference, we
want to steer around tech issues

233
00:16:43,628 --> 00:16:47,090
and focus on the super strong bond
with your new teammate, Luca Cortez.

234
00:16:47,173 --> 00:16:48,925
Luca?

235
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:50,510
Who I've known a week.

236
00:16:51,052 --> 00:16:53,096
Who when he was third banana
on the left at Red Bull,

237
00:16:53,179 --> 00:16:55,765
told the press he thought
Joshua Pearce was overrated.

238
00:16:56,808 --> 00:16:58,143
That Luca Cortez?

239
00:16:58,226 --> 00:16:59,686
Yes.

240
00:16:59,769 --> 00:17:02,898
-Can't wait. Yeah.
-All right. Great. Thank you.

241
00:17:02,981 --> 00:17:03,982
-Yo.
-Yep.

242
00:17:04,065 --> 00:17:06,276
That's a yes? Yeah? Yes?

243
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:07,361
What's up?

244
00:17:07,444 --> 00:17:09,154
Yo, you were right, bro.

245
00:17:09,696 --> 00:17:12,074
Ruben's in big trouble. He
might have to sell the team.

246
00:17:12,157 --> 00:17:13,992
I knew it.

247
00:17:14,075 --> 00:17:15,243
And what does that mean for me?

248
00:17:15,326 --> 00:17:17,787
New buyers, they're
likely to clean house.

249
00:17:18,997 --> 00:17:19,998
Listen.

250
00:17:20,582 --> 00:17:24,669
You need to show these people who
the number one driver really is, man.

251
00:17:25,295 --> 00:17:26,296
Now.

252
00:17:27,964 --> 00:17:29,257
Or you're gonna lose your job.

253
00:17:29,799 --> 00:17:32,468
Yeah. Let that sink in.

254
00:17:35,597 --> 00:17:37,766
Hey.

255
00:17:38,975 --> 00:17:40,310
You good?

256
00:17:42,645 --> 00:17:46,817
Okay, let's take the
first half of the season

257
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:48,984
and erase it from our minds.

258
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:52,363
Someone says, "Kaspar,
what happened this year?"

259
00:17:52,947 --> 00:17:56,992
I swear on the lives of my
children, I do not freaking know.

260
00:17:58,411 --> 00:17:59,746
There's only this car.

261
00:18:00,330 --> 00:18:03,917
And there is only our future.

262
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,878
Yes. Our future.

263
00:18:15,887 --> 00:18:17,389
Who is that asshole?

264
00:18:17,472 --> 00:18:18,556
He's with me.

265
00:18:19,474 --> 00:18:22,267
Your man thought I was maintenance.
Sent me to the back gate.

266
00:18:24,771 --> 00:18:26,106
Brother, you have
never let me down.

267
00:18:26,189 --> 00:18:28,275
Well, there's still time.

268
00:18:28,358 --> 00:18:29,943
Apex GP!

269
00:18:30,026 --> 00:18:32,487
Sonny Hayes. He raced
with me back in the day.

270
00:18:32,570 --> 00:18:34,322
-Against you, you mean.
-Yeah.

271
00:18:34,405 --> 00:18:36,867
-Kate McKenna, our technical director.
-Hi.

272
00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:39,870
-Dodge Dauda, our chief mechanic.
-Hi.

273
00:18:39,953 --> 00:18:42,122
And Kaspar Smolinski,
team principal.

274
00:18:42,205 --> 00:18:43,749
You may know him by reputation.

275
00:18:43,832 --> 00:18:46,668
Five-time Constructors
champion with Ferrari.

276
00:18:47,210 --> 00:18:48,545
Huh.

277
00:18:49,295 --> 00:18:50,380
As a rear jack man.

278
00:18:50,463 --> 00:18:52,090
So was my pop. Can't
win without 'em.

279
00:18:52,173 --> 00:18:55,134
-And our talented rookie, Joshua.
-Why has he got a helmet?

280
00:18:56,219 --> 00:18:58,013
Uh, safety?

281
00:18:58,096 --> 00:19:00,474
Joshua, your seat is safe. Okay?

282
00:19:00,557 --> 00:19:02,559
Sonny is here for the audition.

283
00:19:04,978 --> 00:19:06,313
When was the last
time you won a race?

284
00:19:06,396 --> 00:19:08,023
Sunday. Daytona.

285
00:19:08,106 --> 00:19:10,025
Oh, I'm sorry. I-I
meant Formula 1.

286
00:19:10,108 --> 00:19:12,360
Oh, I'm sorry. Then same as you.

287
00:19:12,443 --> 00:19:15,447
Wow.

288
00:19:15,530 --> 00:19:18,241
Never thought I'd say this,
has anyone seen Luca Cortez?

289
00:19:18,324 --> 00:19:20,368
Sidebar bitte, Ruben.

290
00:19:20,451 --> 00:19:23,413
When I interview with you,
many veteran drivers...

291
00:19:23,496 --> 00:19:25,081
Yeah, who all turned you down.

292
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:26,708
-How many?
-Seven.

293
00:19:26,791 --> 00:19:28,543
-That's a lot.
-I'm number seven?

294
00:19:28,626 --> 00:19:30,045
-Mm-hmm.
-You're eight.

295
00:19:30,128 --> 00:19:31,379
This is a disaster.

296
00:19:31,462 --> 00:19:32,756
Starting to feel
more like a nine.

297
00:19:32,839 --> 00:19:34,549
Technically, there is one
who I've not heard from yet.

298
00:19:34,632 --> 00:19:35,759
So I am a nine?

299
00:19:35,842 --> 00:19:37,427
You know how
numbers work, right?

300
00:19:37,510 --> 00:19:40,430
In business, my most
inspired ideas come late.

301
00:19:40,513 --> 00:19:43,058
Yeah. Best things in life
usually arrive ninth, right?

302
00:19:43,141 --> 00:19:46,561
With respect, Ruben, I cannot
condone we spend our only test day

303
00:19:46,644 --> 00:19:48,772
giving your long-lost
teammate an audition.

304
00:19:48,855 --> 00:19:50,190
Kaspar, you misunderstand.

305
00:19:50,273 --> 00:19:52,692
We're not auditioning
him. He's auditioning us.

306
00:19:54,110 --> 00:19:55,320
That's your new driver.

307
00:19:55,403 --> 00:19:56,571
Good luck.

308
00:19:59,741 --> 00:20:01,076
New wing, new side pods.

309
00:20:01,159 --> 00:20:02,660
Any changes to the floor?

310
00:20:03,828 --> 00:20:06,456
Nothing the eight other drivers
wouldn't have figured out.

311
00:20:07,332 --> 00:20:09,000
That's why they call
me Lucky Number Nine.

312
00:20:09,083 --> 00:20:11,878
Listen, it's been a while since
you've driven here, mate. Yeah?

313
00:20:11,961 --> 00:20:14,722
The balance on these cars are tricky,
so be careful turn one and nine.

314
00:20:14,923 --> 00:20:16,283
Wouldn't want to
see you get hurt.

315
00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:18,927
How about we set a
reasonable target?

316
00:20:19,010 --> 00:20:22,597
Give me the same setup as him. If I can't
post a lap time within a second of JP's,

317
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:24,432
then I will promptly
see myself out

318
00:20:25,099 --> 00:20:26,977
and you're free to take a
shot at lucky number ten.

319
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:28,853
-Ten?
-Ten.

320
00:20:29,562 --> 00:20:30,563
Ten.

321
00:20:32,774 --> 00:20:33,858
Who's JP?

322
00:20:37,862 --> 00:20:40,490
Cross round on Brooklands,
easy on Luffield.

323
00:20:40,573 --> 00:20:42,742
Up to Woodcote,
hard out in Copse.

324
00:20:42,825 --> 00:20:44,202
And be careful on the curve.

325
00:20:48,957 --> 00:20:51,918
Default mode, settings
one, to two, back to three.

326
00:20:52,543 --> 00:20:54,212
Differential one through four.

327
00:20:54,295 --> 00:20:55,672

Twenty quid says he stacks it.

344
00:22:20,798 --> 00:22:22,508
Make it a hundred, you're on.

345
00:22:23,426 --> 00:22:24,676
Oh, shit.

346
00:22:26,888 --> 00:22:30,058
Sorry, uh, this is Hugh
Nickleby, your race engineer.

347
00:22:30,141 --> 00:22:32,143
Good morning, Hugh. How
are my tire temps looking?

348
00:22:32,226 --> 00:22:35,145
Yep, almost warm. End of the
lap, you should be good to push.

349
00:22:52,705 --> 00:22:54,540
Right. Man.

350
00:22:55,583 --> 00:22:57,210
-Hugh?
-Yes, sir?

351
00:22:57,293 --> 00:22:59,254
You should've taken that bet.

352
00:22:59,337 --> 00:23:00,755
Copy that.

353
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:05,051
♪ No one's accusing
me of sanity ♪

354
00:23:05,843 --> 00:23:09,430
♪ I ain't everybody's
cup of tea ♪

355
00:23:10,098 --> 00:23:11,808
♪ But that's the facts
I'm talkin' factually ♪

356
00:23:11,891 --> 00:23:13,142
Going for a lap.

357
00:23:14,102 --> 00:23:16,438
♪ I'm just as bad
as I used to be ♪

358
00:23:16,521 --> 00:23:20,900
♪ Yes, I'm just as
bad as I used to be ♪

359
00:23:20,983 --> 00:23:24,904
♪ Whoa, I'm just as
bad as I used to be ♪

360
00:23:25,488 --> 00:23:29,659
♪ I'm just as bad
as I used to be ♪

361
00:23:30,701 --> 00:23:33,121
Nope. Shit.

362
00:23:33,204 --> 00:23:34,205
He's dead.

363
00:23:34,288 --> 00:23:37,082
Come on. Don't do that.

364
00:23:38,793 --> 00:23:39,877
And buried.

365
00:24:19,542 --> 00:24:20,626
Wait.

366
00:24:22,628 --> 00:24:24,005
Wait.

367
00:24:27,008 --> 00:24:28,425
Now.

368
00:24:31,929 --> 00:24:33,222
The car is there, come on.

369
00:24:37,476 --> 00:24:39,062
He's gaining.

370
00:24:39,145 --> 00:24:40,438
Ah, shit.

371
00:24:52,950 --> 00:24:54,702
You okay?

372
00:24:54,785 --> 00:24:57,412
Yep. All good.

373
00:25:09,926 --> 00:25:12,303
Oh!

374
00:25:13,054 --> 00:25:15,932
Come on.

375
00:25:16,015 --> 00:25:17,392
Yeah, she's got something.

376
00:25:17,475 --> 00:25:19,018
Yeah, you mean had something.

377
00:25:20,353 --> 00:25:22,564
But definitely snappy in
the high-speed corners.

378
00:25:22,647 --> 00:25:23,981
Unpredictable in the lows.

379
00:25:24,941 --> 00:25:26,943
Had trouble with the
rears, turns 14, 16...

380
00:25:27,026 --> 00:25:28,528
And the final turn, maybe?

381
00:25:28,611 --> 00:25:30,905
-No, that's on me.
-What was his lap time?

382
00:25:31,572 --> 00:25:36,327
He passed his entirely self-imposed
test by five hundredths of a second.

383
00:25:38,829 --> 00:25:40,289
Huh.

384
00:25:43,459 --> 00:25:44,502
Well...

385
00:25:46,379 --> 00:25:47,587
...it's a start.

386
00:25:56,514 --> 00:26:00,226
Bro, we got nine races to catch
the eye of another team, you know.

387
00:26:00,893 --> 00:26:02,645
And as your manager,
I have to advise you

388
00:26:02,728 --> 00:26:05,190
that we need to start hitting
these social and sponsor events.

389
00:26:05,273 --> 00:26:06,900
You need more engagement,
Josh, more followers.

390
00:26:06,983 --> 00:26:09,383
-All right, deal.
-All right, cool. I'm just saying, innit?

391
00:26:10,319 --> 00:26:11,445
You eaten? I'm starving.

392
00:26:11,988 --> 00:26:12,989
Nah.

393
00:26:13,489 --> 00:26:14,657
Gotta see someone though.

394
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:17,452
Yeah? Hey, take a
picture, post that shit.

395
00:26:17,535 --> 00:26:19,078
Send it to me, I'll
post that shit.

396
00:26:19,161 --> 00:26:20,580
It's my mum.

397
00:26:20,663 --> 00:26:22,330
Don't you dare post that shit.

398
00:26:23,499 --> 00:26:25,543
I knew you was gonna say that.

399
00:26:36,595 --> 00:26:38,556
Okay, baby?

400
00:26:39,056 --> 00:26:40,725
Yeah. Just tired.

401
00:26:41,559 --> 00:26:43,102
Bad tires or the engine?

402
00:26:44,020 --> 00:26:45,480
Come on, Mum. You don't
know about the cars.

403
00:26:45,563 --> 00:26:47,774
Facety.

404
00:26:47,857 --> 00:26:51,319
All right, I may not know much about
cars, but I know a lot about you.

405
00:26:51,986 --> 00:26:52,987
Go.

406
00:26:55,448 --> 00:26:57,992
I might lose my seat if
the team don't win a race.

407
00:26:58,993 --> 00:26:59,994
Any race.

408
00:27:00,828 --> 00:27:01,829
There are other teams?

409
00:27:01,912 --> 00:27:03,752
Yeah, there's 20 seats,
but they're all filled.

410
00:27:04,707 --> 00:27:06,793
Plus, there's this
new guy, and...

411
00:27:06,876 --> 00:27:07,877
...he's old.

412
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:09,128
How old?

413
00:27:09,211 --> 00:27:11,796
Like, really old. Like... 80.

414
00:27:15,301 --> 00:27:17,053
He's such an arsehole, Mum.

415
00:27:17,762 --> 00:27:19,013
He's quick, though.

416
00:27:19,597 --> 00:27:20,890
Don't mind that.

417
00:27:20,973 --> 00:27:22,517
Focus on you.

418
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:24,811
You can spend your whole life
worrying about other people,

419
00:27:24,894 --> 00:27:27,355
but your time is right now.

420
00:27:29,315 --> 00:27:30,441
You still love it?

421
00:27:31,984 --> 00:27:33,236
Course I still love it.

422
00:27:33,319 --> 00:27:35,613
Then remember what your
father used to say.

423
00:27:36,489 --> 00:27:38,949
"Put your head down and drive."

424
00:27:40,117 --> 00:27:41,117
Yes, ma'am.

425
00:28:05,309 --> 00:28:07,895
Come on, then. It's all
good. Come on. Come on, then.

426
00:28:07,978 --> 00:28:09,855
Come on. Come on.

427
00:28:10,481 --> 00:28:12,524
-Come here. Come on, then.
-You're kiddin' me.

428
00:28:14,693 --> 00:28:17,363
Don't park there. It's
just a car. Quieten down.

429
00:28:17,446 --> 00:28:18,781
Come on, eh? Come on.

430
00:28:28,207 --> 00:28:30,584
Thought your job was to build
the fastest car on the planet.

431
00:28:31,210 --> 00:28:33,629
My job is wind.

432
00:28:34,505 --> 00:28:36,507
So, helps to feel it.

433
00:28:37,842 --> 00:28:38,842
Mmm.

434
00:28:40,344 --> 00:28:42,722
Mysterious moves at Apex GP,

435
00:28:42,805 --> 00:28:46,476
who have finally announced the driver
who will take their second seat.

436
00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:49,687
And in a bizarre twist,
it's American Sonny Hayes,

437
00:28:49,770 --> 00:28:53,024
who hasn't raced in Formula
1 for over three decades.

438
00:28:53,107 --> 00:28:54,817
Son of an IndyCar mechanic,

439
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:58,363
Hayes was considered something
of a reckless young phenomenon,

440
00:28:58,446 --> 00:29:00,698
the greatest who never was.

441
00:29:00,781 --> 00:29:03,576
His former career being
brought to an abrupt halt

442
00:29:03,659 --> 00:29:06,537
by a horrific accident at
the Spanish Grand Prix.

443
00:29:07,079 --> 00:29:10,208
He reappeared a decade later
in racing championships

444
00:29:10,291 --> 00:29:13,628
as diverse as Le Mans,
NASCAR, the Dakar Rally,

445
00:29:13,711 --> 00:29:16,589
and even a stint as a
New York taxi driver.

446
00:29:16,672 --> 00:29:18,591
Oh, no.

447
00:29:18,674 --> 00:29:20,676
But now he's back racing
for a team which has,

448
00:29:20,759 --> 00:29:25,264
in its entire F1 history, never
even finished in the top ten.

449
00:29:25,347 --> 00:29:27,266
None of this will
dampen speculation

450
00:29:27,349 --> 00:29:31,687
that majority shareholder Cervantes
Capital are looking to sell the team.

451
00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:34,440
And if they do, that will
likely also bring an end

452
00:29:34,523 --> 00:29:37,235
to the career of F1
rookie Joshua Pearce.

453
00:29:37,318 --> 00:29:39,070
-Can we go now?
-"Desperate times," they say,

454
00:29:39,153 --> 00:29:40,530
"call for desperate measures,"

455
00:29:40,613 --> 00:29:43,366
but I honestly cannot
recall a driver signing

456
00:29:43,449 --> 00:29:45,493
-quite as desperate as this.
-Let's go.

457
00:29:46,744 --> 00:29:49,288
Boy, look at my son.

458
00:29:49,371 --> 00:29:51,332
-Huh?
-Hey.

459
00:29:51,415 --> 00:29:53,126
-That's the one.
-Huh.

460
00:29:53,209 --> 00:29:55,420
That's the other driver?

461
00:29:55,503 --> 00:29:58,256
Yep. That's him and
his stupid face.

462
00:29:58,339 --> 00:30:00,842
But, wait, you said he
was old. He not that old.

463
00:30:00,925 --> 00:30:02,343
Hey, Josh.

464
00:30:02,426 --> 00:30:03,928
You want a next shot anywhere?

465
00:30:04,011 --> 00:30:07,014
Nine races means nine times
you have to beat Chuck Norris.

466
00:30:09,058 --> 00:30:11,227
For now, start by
winning over the press.

467
00:30:11,310 --> 00:30:13,396
-Yeah? You ready?
-Mm-hmm.

468
00:30:13,479 --> 00:30:14,688
Cool. Let's go.

469
00:30:15,231 --> 00:30:16,149
Mmm.

470
00:30:16,232 --> 00:30:19,360
That's a handsome
man right there.

471
00:30:21,111 --> 00:30:26,409
Joshua. Hey. Um, it's been an
undeniably messy start to your season.

472
00:30:26,492 --> 00:30:32,331
No wins, car problems throughout, and
now you have another new teammate.

473
00:30:32,414 --> 00:30:34,208
How exactly are you finding it?

474
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,879
Messy start doesn't mean you
can't finish neat. All right?

475
00:30:37,962 --> 00:30:41,716
Apex have a fire crew of engineers, so
I'm confident we'll come back fightin'.

476
00:30:41,799 --> 00:30:43,759
In terms of new teammates,

477
00:30:44,552 --> 00:30:47,971
I think it's really wonderful that Apex
are giving second chances to the elderly.

478
00:30:50,057 --> 00:30:52,851
Ah, yes. Next question.
Thank you. Yes, Don. Yeah.

479
00:30:53,602 --> 00:30:56,439
Mr. Hayes. Hi. Don Cavendish.
Um, welcome back to the UK.

480
00:30:56,522 --> 00:30:57,857
It's been a while, mmm?

481
00:30:57,940 --> 00:30:59,567
I mean, last time you
raced at Silverstone,

482
00:30:59,650 --> 00:31:03,154
Bill Clinton was your president, and
we were all dancing the Macarena.

483
00:31:03,237 --> 00:31:05,948
So, uh, it must be
surreal to be back.

484
00:31:08,242 --> 00:31:09,285
Yeah.

485
00:31:11,412 --> 00:31:13,956
And, uh, during that
decade, you gave up racing,

486
00:31:14,039 --> 00:31:16,042
and, uh, gambled professionally?

487
00:31:16,125 --> 00:31:17,209
Uh-huh.

488
00:31:17,835 --> 00:31:20,505
Before declaring yourself
personally bankrupt?

489
00:31:20,588 --> 00:31:21,881
Yep.

490
00:31:21,964 --> 00:31:24,884
You had a marriage annulled
and two more ended in divorce?

491
00:31:24,967 --> 00:31:26,385
Yep.

492
00:31:28,178 --> 00:31:29,888
Anything you wish
you'd done differently?

493
00:31:31,682 --> 00:31:32,682
Yeah.

494
00:31:36,020 --> 00:31:38,521
No more questions. Thank
you. Yes. Thank you.

495
00:32:57,142 --> 00:32:58,143
Yes, Dodge.

496
00:33:02,022 --> 00:33:03,190
What time was he here?

497
00:33:03,273 --> 00:33:04,400
Before me.

498
00:33:11,198 --> 00:33:13,366
And before you.

499
00:33:25,129 --> 00:33:27,298
Okay, here he comes. Apologize.

500
00:33:27,381 --> 00:33:29,091
Apologize? I can't do that.

501
00:33:29,591 --> 00:33:32,303
-How you mean? Why not?
-Because it's a sign of weakness.

502
00:33:32,386 --> 00:33:33,429
It's a sign of strength.

503
00:33:33,512 --> 00:33:34,805
Sign of weakness.

504
00:33:35,347 --> 00:33:36,849
You hard ears, just do it.

505
00:33:36,932 --> 00:33:38,184
Mum, I can't.

506
00:33:38,267 --> 00:33:39,935
You can. You will.

507
00:33:52,239 --> 00:33:53,240
Hey, man.

508
00:33:54,742 --> 00:33:57,369
Other day at the press conference,
stuff I said wasn't cool.

509
00:33:58,787 --> 00:34:00,831
You say sorry.

510
00:34:00,914 --> 00:34:06,003
So, basically what I'm trying
to say is... I'm sorry.

511
00:34:06,086 --> 00:34:09,131
It's all right. You're just worried
I'm quicker than you. Hi, I'm Sonny.

512
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:11,842
Oh, Bernadette Pearce.
Nice to meet you.

513
00:34:12,426 --> 00:34:14,802
Pleasure. It's all good.
I'll see you out there.

514
00:34:26,106 --> 00:34:27,316
How are you feeling?

515
00:34:27,399 --> 00:34:28,984
-So good.
-Good.

516
00:34:32,237 --> 00:34:33,322
-You good?
-Good.

517
00:34:33,822 --> 00:34:34,823
Good.

518
00:34:35,908 --> 00:34:36,826
No pressure.

519
00:34:36,909 --> 00:34:37,993
None.

520
00:34:43,415 --> 00:34:45,209
-Great.
-Great.

521
00:34:45,292 --> 00:34:46,543
Great.

522
00:34:47,252 --> 00:34:48,879
Welcome along to Silverstone,

523
00:34:48,962 --> 00:34:54,552
the circuit where on the 13th of May 1950
the Formula 1 World Championship began.

524
00:34:54,635 --> 00:34:59,265
Today, we kick off the final nine races
of this thrilling championship season

525
00:34:59,348 --> 00:35:02,518
here at the 77th
British Grand Prix.

526
00:35:02,601 --> 00:35:05,062
As always, 11 teams
will take the grid,

527
00:35:05,145 --> 00:35:07,064
fielding two drivers each.

528
00:35:07,147 --> 00:35:10,943
With race order determined by the
qualifying times set yesterday.

529
00:35:11,026 --> 00:35:13,028
Red Bull will start on pole

530
00:35:13,111 --> 00:35:16,657
followed by the two
McLarens and two Ferraris.

531
00:35:17,908 --> 00:35:20,326
Drivers, two minutes
to national anthem.

532
00:35:49,231 --> 00:35:50,315
Sonny!

533
00:35:51,233 --> 00:35:52,985
Ah, Ruben. Don't make
me talk to the money.

534
00:35:53,068 --> 00:35:55,321
Come on, give me a moment.
Just smile and shake hands.

535
00:35:55,404 --> 00:35:57,072
He's an important
member of the board.

536
00:35:57,155 --> 00:35:58,616
Sonny, this is Peter Banning,

537
00:35:58,699 --> 00:35:59,909
-one of my investors.
-Hi.

538
00:35:59,992 --> 00:36:00,993
Hi.

539
00:36:01,076 --> 00:36:03,037
He knows absolutely
nothing about racing...

540
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:05,664
-Yeah.
-...but he's my eyes and ears on the board.

541
00:36:05,747 --> 00:36:08,125
And, uh, you're
Ruben's Hail Mary.

542
00:36:08,208 --> 00:36:09,877
Now, that is an American
football term, right?

543
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:11,504
The Hail Mary, the
long shot. The...

544
00:36:11,587 --> 00:36:13,005
I believe it's a religious
term, originally.

545
00:36:13,088 --> 00:36:14,089
That is true. That is true.

546
00:36:14,172 --> 00:36:15,883
I'm praying to them all.

547
00:36:15,966 --> 00:36:18,219
I'm the one guy on the board who
actually wants to keep the team.

548
00:36:18,302 --> 00:36:20,137
The rest are calling it,
you know, Ruben's Inferno.

549
00:36:20,220 --> 00:36:21,931
But, seriously, man, I'm hooked.

550
00:36:22,014 --> 00:36:24,475
I've binged all of
Drive to Survive.

551
00:36:24,558 --> 00:36:27,645
I honestly don't think I've ever known
so much about car tires. It's incredible.

552
00:36:27,728 --> 00:36:28,896
I'm gonna get back
to my day job.

553
00:36:28,979 --> 00:36:30,813
-Okay.
-Okay.

554
00:36:32,232 --> 00:36:34,484
Hey, man. We're counting
on you. Good luck.

555
00:37:33,085 --> 00:37:34,878
What are you doing here, Sonny?

556
00:37:50,852 --> 00:37:53,397
And as the clock ticks then
to the top of the hour,

557
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:56,233
it's time to get things
going here at Silverstone.

558
00:37:56,316 --> 00:37:57,943
It's formation lap first.

559
00:37:58,026 --> 00:38:03,115
One tour of the track and a chance for the
drivers to warm up their tires and brakes.

560
00:38:05,951 --> 00:38:08,454
Oh, no. There's a
problem for Apex.

561
00:38:08,537 --> 00:38:11,790
That's Hayes in P22.
His car hasn't moved.

562
00:38:11,873 --> 00:38:13,959
Hang on. I got power trouble.

563
00:38:14,042 --> 00:38:16,462
It's start mode, Sonny.

564
00:38:16,545 --> 00:38:17,880
Start mode on.

565
00:38:17,963 --> 00:38:19,965
Yes, a lesson for
everyone at home.

566
00:38:20,048 --> 00:38:22,092
New car? Do read the manual.

567
00:38:22,175 --> 00:38:24,553
It's been a while since he was
out on the track. At this rate...

568
00:38:24,636 --> 00:38:26,722
-Dios mío.
-...he's not even gonna get into the race.

569
00:38:26,805 --> 00:38:27,889
Ay.

570
00:38:29,433 --> 00:38:30,434
I got it.

571
00:38:30,517 --> 00:38:31,601
All good.

572
00:38:33,603 --> 00:38:36,190
And he's away at last.
Thank goodness for that.

573
00:38:36,273 --> 00:38:38,651
If he falls too far behind
on the formation lap...

574
00:38:38,734 --> 00:38:39,735
-Drink?
-...he'll be at risk...

575
00:38:39,818 --> 00:38:42,320
-Eh? No.
-...of having to start in the pit lane.

576
00:38:43,488 --> 00:38:45,950
Where's Sonny?
He's holding us up.

577
00:38:46,033 --> 00:38:48,452
Yeah. Just checking,
Joshua. Just checking.

578
00:38:49,619 --> 00:38:51,497
-What's wrong with his car?
-What? Nothing.

579
00:38:51,580 --> 00:38:52,998
With a clear track ahead,

580
00:38:53,081 --> 00:38:56,293
Hayes has been able to push much
harder on this formation lap.

581
00:38:56,376 --> 00:38:59,880
He'll turn up at the back of the
grid with warm tires, ready to go.

582
00:39:01,048 --> 00:39:03,592
Cheeky shit. It's on purpose.

583
00:39:08,472 --> 00:39:09,723
What is this guy doing?

584
00:39:09,806 --> 00:39:13,686
This is actually now turning into
an advantage for Sonny Hayes.

585
00:39:13,769 --> 00:39:17,981
And he's just made it in
time. Watch out for his start.

586
00:39:26,948 --> 00:39:31,118
Five lights ahead of the drivers.
It's lights out and away we go!

587
00:39:44,174 --> 00:39:46,301
Here comes Sonny Hayes,
ladies and gentlemen.

588
00:39:46,384 --> 00:39:50,180
Using those warm tires to carve his
way through the back of the field.

589
00:39:50,263 --> 00:39:53,142
And if you ever need
confidence in your car,

590
00:39:53,225 --> 00:39:54,768
it's here at Silverstone.

591
00:40:11,576 --> 00:40:13,412
Hayes is just
sailing past people.

592
00:40:13,495 --> 00:40:16,415
He's moved up seven
places since the start.

593
00:40:16,498 --> 00:40:19,334
-Apex GP has struggled with this car...
-Yes!

594
00:40:19,417 --> 00:40:21,712
...but they've brought an
upgrade package this weekend.

595
00:40:21,795 --> 00:40:25,799
Let's see if it makes a difference as
Hayes attacks Perez in the Red Bull.

596
00:40:29,719 --> 00:40:32,597
Car's bouncing around this dirty
air. I can't position to attack.

597
00:40:33,390 --> 00:40:35,684
Hayes complaining about
his car over the radio.

598
00:40:35,767 --> 00:40:38,520
That's not what the
team wants to hear.

599
00:40:38,603 --> 00:40:41,774
Copy. Gap is 0.9 to Perez.
You're within DRS range.

600
00:40:41,857 --> 00:40:44,109
Should be able to take
him on the next straight.

601
00:40:46,778 --> 00:40:50,240
Hayes now using the drag
reduction system to get past.

602
00:40:50,323 --> 00:40:51,742
Yeah!

603
00:40:51,825 --> 00:40:53,994
Won't be able to hold him
off, guys. I got no grip.

604
00:40:54,077 --> 00:40:56,080
-This is trouble now for Apex GP.
-Oh, come on.

605
00:40:56,163 --> 00:40:57,915
The Red Bull's
tires are now warm

606
00:40:57,998 --> 00:41:01,543
and Hayes hasn't got his tire
advantage from the start anymore.

607
00:41:01,626 --> 00:41:05,005
We've seen the attack. Now
it's all about defense.

608
00:41:05,088 --> 00:41:07,800
And Perez on the
attack into Vale.

609
00:41:07,883 --> 00:41:11,178
Hayes is in trouble. This
could be the places reversed.

610
00:41:11,261 --> 00:41:13,222
And it is.

611
00:41:13,305 --> 00:41:14,306
Damn.

612
00:41:14,389 --> 00:41:16,433
Rear end is loose. Tell
me if you see a fix.

613
00:41:16,516 --> 00:41:19,311
Tell him to pull back the
entry to get a better exit.

614
00:41:19,394 --> 00:41:21,688
He-He thinks it's
the setup. It's not.

615
00:41:24,065 --> 00:41:25,109
Twenty laps down.

616
00:41:25,192 --> 00:41:29,113
Verstappen leads but Joshua Pearce is
struggling out there at the moment.

617
00:41:29,196 --> 00:41:32,074
Guys, get me off these
softs. I'm going backwards.

618
00:41:32,157 --> 00:41:34,910
Copy that. Lap 20. Box, box.

619
00:41:34,993 --> 00:41:37,412
Stakes couldn't be higher
for rookie Joshua Pearce.

620
00:41:37,495 --> 00:41:41,208
This is not where you
want to be, in last place.

621
00:41:43,627 --> 00:41:45,170
I'm jammed. Back up!

622
00:41:52,302 --> 00:41:53,677
Hit something. What was that?

623
00:41:54,763 --> 00:41:57,224
Ooh, a seven-second pit stop.

624
00:41:57,307 --> 00:41:59,351
Apex GP won't be
happy with that.

625
00:41:59,434 --> 00:42:02,354
That's double the time
it should've taken.

626
00:42:02,437 --> 00:42:03,981
Lost the rears. Box, box.

627
00:42:04,064 --> 00:42:06,066
Copy. Go to plan B. Box, box.

628
00:42:06,775 --> 00:42:09,403
And here comes Sonny Hayes
for a fresh set of tires.

629
00:42:09,486 --> 00:42:14,241
He'll be hoping these will help him
hold on to his current position of P15.

630
00:42:14,324 --> 00:42:15,242
Front jacks! Front jacks!

631
00:42:15,325 --> 00:42:16,952
The front jack has
not worked properly.

632
00:42:17,035 --> 00:42:20,289
-You're kidding me.
-This is causing absolute pandemonium

633
00:42:20,372 --> 00:42:22,749
in the Apex GP pit lane.

634
00:42:24,584 --> 00:42:27,963
Whatever could go wrong is
going wrong for this team.

635
00:42:31,132 --> 00:42:34,636
And coming out of the pit, Hayes
just ahead of his teammate.

636
00:42:34,719 --> 00:42:39,183
As Pearce and Hayes go battling
it out here at Silverstone.

637
00:42:39,266 --> 00:42:40,600
Coming for you, old man.

638
00:42:47,983 --> 00:42:49,693
Got the pace, man. Tell
him to let me pass.

639
00:42:49,776 --> 00:42:51,445
Yeah. Copy. Hold
position. Stand by. Kate.

640
00:42:51,528 --> 00:42:54,364
Josh is faster. Sonny
is on cold tires.

641
00:42:59,869 --> 00:43:01,749
Yeah, okay, Sonny, no
fighting. Let him through.

642
00:43:07,043 --> 00:43:09,087
Sonny, no fighting.

643
00:43:09,170 --> 00:43:10,631
Who's fighting? I'm racing.

644
00:43:10,714 --> 00:43:13,091
Pearce on the inside,
Hayes on the outside.

645
00:43:13,174 --> 00:43:15,510
Hayes trying to make
him eat concrete

646
00:43:15,593 --> 00:43:17,262
up against the old
pit wall there.

647
00:43:17,345 --> 00:43:19,514
Joshua, you're gonna have
to fight for position.

648
00:43:19,597 --> 00:43:20,599
You are racing Sonny.

649
00:43:20,682 --> 00:43:21,767
A-ffirm.

650
00:43:21,850 --> 00:43:24,353
They're giving
absolutely no quarter.

651
00:43:24,436 --> 00:43:26,355
No benefit to their
teammate at all.

652
00:43:26,438 --> 00:43:29,107
They're pushing as if they're
trying to win a Grand Prix.

653
00:43:29,190 --> 00:43:32,402
But this is the battle
for last place, remember?

654
00:43:32,485 --> 00:43:33,654
And what a brawl it is.

655
00:43:33,737 --> 00:43:35,238
Let's go, kid. Bring it.

656
00:43:38,783 --> 00:43:40,534
What is this guy
doing? Let me through.

657
00:43:56,968 --> 00:43:58,720
Round the final corner.

658
00:43:58,803 --> 00:43:59,930
It's close!

659
00:44:00,013 --> 00:44:01,556
They make contact.

660
00:44:01,639 --> 00:44:05,102
Both Apex GP cars
into the gravel,

661
00:44:05,185 --> 00:44:07,269
and Pearce hits the barrier.

662
00:44:09,314 --> 00:44:10,648
-Ah, no!
-No!

663
00:44:11,358 --> 00:44:12,442
This is mad.

664
00:44:12,525 --> 00:44:14,736
The cardinal sin
of motor racing.

665
00:44:14,819 --> 00:44:16,446
A double DNF.

666
00:44:16,529 --> 00:44:20,409
Just when it couldn't get any
worse for the black and gold.

667
00:44:20,492 --> 00:44:22,243
That's a tough one, man.

668
00:44:38,593 --> 00:44:39,803
We can't corner.

669
00:44:39,886 --> 00:44:42,472
We're bouncing around the place
like we're on the bloody Tube

670
00:44:42,555 --> 00:44:44,995
and now we think it's cool to
leave wheel guns in the pit box.

671
00:44:45,475 --> 00:44:46,393
Who even was that?

672
00:44:46,476 --> 00:44:48,728
-That was me.
-Of course.

673
00:44:51,356 --> 00:44:52,357
Old man.

674
00:44:55,318 --> 00:44:57,987
You losing your
hearing? What was that?

675
00:44:58,988 --> 00:44:59,906
You wanna do this here?

676
00:44:59,989 --> 00:45:02,284
Yeah, I'd love to do this here
in front of the team, right.

677
00:45:02,367 --> 00:45:03,702
The one that you're
apparently a part of.

678
00:45:03,785 --> 00:45:06,538
Okay. You made a
mistake. It happens.

679
00:45:06,621 --> 00:45:08,290
I made a mistake. I
love this guy, man.

680
00:45:08,373 --> 00:45:10,751
-Don't worry about it, Jodie.
-Are you even listening to me?

681
00:45:10,834 --> 00:45:12,711
-Not really.
-No!

682
00:45:12,794 --> 00:45:14,129
Stop.

683
00:45:14,212 --> 00:45:15,630
Joshua is right.

684
00:45:15,713 --> 00:45:17,299
An order is an order.

685
00:45:17,382 --> 00:45:20,301
May I remind you that
you report to me?

686
00:45:23,972 --> 00:45:24,973
Cool.

687
00:45:25,765 --> 00:45:27,684
Just don't ask me
to give up position.

688
00:45:30,728 --> 00:45:32,647
Sorry. Sorry, guys.

689
00:45:34,774 --> 00:45:36,318
Hold up.

690
00:45:36,401 --> 00:45:37,986
You swan into our garage
like some entitled prick.

691
00:45:38,069 --> 00:45:39,863
-"Swan"?
-Calling us piss poor...

692
00:45:39,946 --> 00:45:41,573
-What's "swan"?
-...and then you drive like that. Huh?

693
00:45:41,656 --> 00:45:43,533
You said I "swan."
What's that mean?

694
00:45:43,616 --> 00:45:46,328
You. You're an arsehole. You come
in like an arsehole. You swan.

695
00:45:46,411 --> 00:45:48,163
So swans are assholes?

696
00:45:50,206 --> 00:45:52,876
You're making the mistake of thinking
that I'm just gonna be some grateful kid

697
00:45:52,959 --> 00:45:54,794
who'll bend a knee
to an old-timer.

698
00:45:55,462 --> 00:45:57,672
I climbed a mountain
to get here, bro.

699
00:45:58,465 --> 00:45:59,466
Formula 1.

700
00:45:59,549 --> 00:46:02,302
Back home we call that
a participation trophy.

701
00:46:02,385 --> 00:46:04,386
Joshua, Joshua! Josh!

702
00:46:05,513 --> 00:46:07,515
Yeah.

703
00:46:08,850 --> 00:46:11,103
What the hell are you
smiling about, man?

704
00:46:11,186 --> 00:46:12,437
Did you win something?

705
00:46:12,979 --> 00:46:15,148
There's 20 other drivers
still out on that track

706
00:46:15,231 --> 00:46:17,234
and you're in here
posing for that nonsense.

707
00:46:17,317 --> 00:46:20,320
Do you think any of
them respect us? Do you?

708
00:46:21,446 --> 00:46:24,699
They need to learn that no one
gets past us without a fight.

709
00:46:24,782 --> 00:46:25,867
No one.

710
00:46:28,870 --> 00:46:31,623
You don't like the way I'm
driving? Beat me, swan.

711
00:46:38,963 --> 00:46:39,964
Hell of a race, huh?

712
00:46:40,507 --> 00:46:41,633
Whoo!

713
00:47:00,026 --> 00:47:03,238
Sorry, I didn't see you. Um...

714
00:47:03,988 --> 00:47:05,907
You still beating yourself up?

715
00:47:05,990 --> 00:47:07,200
Yeah.

716
00:47:07,283 --> 00:47:09,452
Yeah, I know that one.

717
00:47:11,788 --> 00:47:14,666
Um, thanks for what
you said out there.

718
00:47:16,167 --> 00:47:18,920
Just don't do it again, okay?

719
00:47:19,629 --> 00:47:21,214
Makes me look like I need help.

720
00:47:21,923 --> 00:47:24,759
Oh, man. You're right. Got it.

721
00:47:25,343 --> 00:47:28,346
Hey, for what it's worth,
don't be shitty to yourself.

722
00:47:28,429 --> 00:47:30,432
There's plenty of people out
there that'll do that for you.

723
00:47:30,515 --> 00:47:31,849
Yeah.

724
00:47:40,316 --> 00:47:44,863
"I'm sorry, Ruben, for demolishing
not one but both of your lovely cars.

725
00:47:44,946 --> 00:47:47,407
For coming back into your
life only to destroy it."

726
00:47:47,490 --> 00:47:48,825
Is this your revenge for Monaco?

727
00:47:48,908 --> 00:47:50,327
Yeah, I waited 30 years

728
00:47:50,410 --> 00:47:53,747
and came all this way to humiliate
myself on global television.

729
00:47:53,830 --> 00:47:57,250
Funny. You think I brought you
in to make my other driver quit?

730
00:47:57,959 --> 00:48:01,420
Listen, he's cocky. He's
arrogant. He's got a lot to learn.

731
00:48:05,049 --> 00:48:07,802
You were cocky, you were arrogant
and you had a lot to learn.

732
00:48:07,885 --> 00:48:10,639
I'm not here to hold anyone's
hand. I'm here to race.

733
00:48:10,722 --> 00:48:13,725
No, you're not, Sonny. You're
here to give me a heart attack.

734
00:48:14,976 --> 00:48:16,603
The board is up my ass

735
00:48:17,979 --> 00:48:20,315
and I have to decide whether
to continue this fiasco

736
00:48:20,398 --> 00:48:23,109
-or pull the plug now.
-You have till the end of the season.

737
00:48:23,192 --> 00:48:26,029
By which time Apex will be
worth less than my shoes!

738
00:48:26,738 --> 00:48:28,489
Sonny! God...

739
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:32,243
Tell me about Kate.

740
00:48:33,745 --> 00:48:35,330
The car. I wanna talk
to her about the car.

741
00:48:35,413 --> 00:48:37,916
She's the world's first female
tech director of an F1 team.

742
00:48:37,999 --> 00:48:39,459
I mean, that takes balls.

743
00:48:39,542 --> 00:48:41,628
Wow. Is that your line?

744
00:48:42,211 --> 00:48:43,213
She'll see right through it.

745
00:48:43,296 --> 00:48:44,422
It's not a line.

746
00:48:44,505 --> 00:48:46,883
-I'm sorry. Sorry.
-Is she married?

747
00:48:47,467 --> 00:48:50,595
Okay, stay there in that
tub of ice until Budapest.

748
00:48:50,678 --> 00:48:52,221
You don't move.

749
00:48:54,599 --> 00:48:55,767
Hey, Ruben...

750
00:48:57,852 --> 00:48:59,354
We can't get there
with this car.

751
00:49:45,775 --> 00:49:47,402
Hey. Hey.

752
00:49:47,485 --> 00:49:48,986
Yeah, sorry. Hi, hi, hi.

753
00:49:49,612 --> 00:49:50,613
What you working on?

754
00:49:51,322 --> 00:49:55,744
I'm working on a new front wing concept.
Trying to pick us up a tenth or so.

755
00:49:55,827 --> 00:49:59,289
Cool. And you can replicate
turns? Lateral airflow?

756
00:49:59,372 --> 00:50:01,166
No, just straight line drag.

757
00:50:01,249 --> 00:50:03,418
But, I mean, we can
calculate it from there.

758
00:50:04,168 --> 00:50:07,339
Okay, what about turbulent air
from a car we're following?

759
00:50:07,422 --> 00:50:09,341
No, not exactly, but...

760
00:50:09,424 --> 00:50:12,218
Track conditions, surface
quality, weather, ambient temps?

761
00:50:12,301 --> 00:50:16,514
I'm sorry, uh, is there something
that you wanted to discuss?

762
00:50:16,597 --> 00:50:19,267
Kate, you read my mind.

763
00:50:23,271 --> 00:50:27,025
So how does one get to be the first
female technical director of an F1 team?

764
00:50:27,108 --> 00:50:28,359
Must take...

765
00:50:31,696 --> 00:50:34,616
dedication and
lots of hard work.

766
00:50:34,699 --> 00:50:38,078
-That's your urgent question?
-Hmm? Mm-mmm.

767
00:50:38,161 --> 00:50:42,082
Plenty of people think I don't belong
here and I'm happy to add you to the list

768
00:50:42,165 --> 00:50:43,958
if you're implying what I...
I think you're implying.

769
00:50:44,041 --> 00:50:45,335
As a rule I don't imply stuff.

770
00:50:45,418 --> 00:50:46,836
So you like straight talk?

771
00:50:46,919 --> 00:50:48,755
Straight as an arrow. No sugar.

772
00:50:49,714 --> 00:50:51,466
Everyone thinks Ruben's lost it.

773
00:50:51,549 --> 00:50:52,801
That he is clutching at straws.

774
00:50:52,884 --> 00:50:54,636
They're saying
maybe he lost a bet.

775
00:50:54,719 --> 00:50:57,097
Ran over your dog.

776
00:50:57,180 --> 00:51:01,851
They're saying Sonny
Hayes isn't a has-been.

777
00:51:02,351 --> 00:51:03,519
He's a never-was.

778
00:51:07,106 --> 00:51:09,734
Yeah, when I said I like
straight talk I meant me.

779
00:51:10,276 --> 00:51:13,488
From others, I mostly prefer
praise, flattery, hero worship,

780
00:51:13,571 --> 00:51:15,365
at times, straight-up bullshit.

781
00:51:15,448 --> 00:51:17,826
Is that what Ruben's for?

782
00:51:17,909 --> 00:51:20,286
Ruben. I love the guy.
Most solid, steadfast...

783
00:51:20,369 --> 00:51:21,746
Said you asked if I was married.

784
00:51:21,829 --> 00:51:25,208
Disloyal, mean, twisted,
bitter, husk of a man.

785
00:51:25,291 --> 00:51:31,589
Mmm, yeah. And he also told me about a
big string of ex-wives and girlfriends.

786
00:51:31,672 --> 00:51:33,258
He said to avoid
you like the plague.

787
00:51:33,341 --> 00:51:36,761
Okay... let me explain this.

788
00:51:37,804 --> 00:51:40,056
When you're going 200 miles
per hour into Eau Rouge,

789
00:51:40,139 --> 00:51:42,391
it's good to know
who's got your back.

790
00:51:43,643 --> 00:51:45,353
And for the record, in
all my years of racing,

791
00:51:45,436 --> 00:51:49,816
I have never ever hit on
the team technical director.

792
00:51:49,899 --> 00:51:54,195
Well, now that's a huge
weight off my mind.

793
00:51:58,032 --> 00:52:00,201
So what's this urgent question?

794
00:52:00,284 --> 00:52:01,577
Okay.

795
00:52:02,453 --> 00:52:05,749
Red Bull, Ferrari,
Mercedes, Aston, now McLaren

796
00:52:05,832 --> 00:52:07,375
all have us beat on
straight line speed.

797
00:52:07,458 --> 00:52:09,919
Our shot is battling
in the turns.

798
00:52:10,002 --> 00:52:12,797
I need a way to chase
through the dirty air.

799
00:52:15,258 --> 00:52:19,304
You want me to redesign
so you can follow closer?

800
00:52:19,387 --> 00:52:20,972
We need to build
our car for combat.

801
00:52:22,056 --> 00:52:24,267
Uh, how am I supposed
to make that safe?

802
00:52:24,350 --> 00:52:25,893
Who said anything about safe?

803
00:52:28,396 --> 00:52:29,647
That's your question?

804
00:52:29,730 --> 00:52:30,940
Yeah.

805
00:52:31,023 --> 00:52:32,316
And here's the straight talk.

806
00:52:33,484 --> 00:52:34,485
It's urgent.

807
00:52:40,324 --> 00:52:42,827
You know, I bet when
you look in the mirror,

808
00:52:42,910 --> 00:52:49,375
you see this rough-and-tumble,
old school, no bullshit cowboy.

809
00:52:49,458 --> 00:52:52,545
Doesn't take orders.
Goes his own way. Huh?

810
00:52:52,628 --> 00:52:54,130
A lone wolf.

811
00:52:55,131 --> 00:52:56,549
Well, I have news for you.

812
00:52:56,632 --> 00:52:59,552
Formula 1 is a team
sport. It always was.

813
00:52:59,635 --> 00:53:02,555
And maybe that's why
you failed at it?

814
00:53:03,681 --> 00:53:07,435
The only question here is, "Why
did Sonny Hayes come back to F1?"

815
00:53:07,518 --> 00:53:12,189
Now that question is
extremely fucking urgent.

816
00:53:16,402 --> 00:53:19,822

831
00:54:40,695 --> 00:54:44,073
At the Spanish Grand Prix, the
American rookie Sonny Hayes

832
00:54:44,156 --> 00:54:48,077
had just signed a new contract,
and his future looked very bright.

833
00:54:48,160 --> 00:54:51,873
He'd earned a reputation for
his aggressive driving style.

834
00:54:51,956 --> 00:54:55,835
Seen by some as reckless, it
nevertheless served him well

835
00:54:55,918 --> 00:54:58,671
as he climbed up the order
over the course of the season,

836
00:54:58,754 --> 00:55:01,841
relentlessly pursuing
his first F1 victory.

837
00:55:03,551 --> 00:55:06,262
Hayes was running well
in the opening laps,

838
00:55:06,345 --> 00:55:08,973
chasing down race
leader Ayrton Senna.

839
00:55:09,056 --> 00:55:11,225
However when Hayes
made a risky move

840
00:55:11,308 --> 00:55:15,438
and attacked Senna on the outside
of a high-speed right-hand turn,

841
00:55:16,022 --> 00:55:19,317
a frightening scene unfolded
as quick as a flash.

842
00:55:19,400 --> 00:55:21,945
My goodness! I just saw him
plunge off to the right.

843
00:55:22,028 --> 00:55:23,571
There you can see the
debris on the right.

844
00:55:23,654 --> 00:55:26,240
What on earth happened
there, I don't know.

845
00:55:26,323 --> 00:55:27,700
Yes, this looks
very severe indeed.

846
00:55:27,783 --> 00:55:31,162
I must say, it looks like, uh,
he is... he really needs help.

847
00:55:31,245 --> 00:55:33,081
There is nobody coming
to him at the moment.

848
00:55:33,164 --> 00:55:35,375
The race has been stopped.
The red flag is out.

849
00:55:35,458 --> 00:55:37,376
This looks a little
bit like a...

850
00:55:54,643 --> 00:55:58,147
Our models predict all teams are
gonna be targeting a one-stop race.

851
00:55:58,230 --> 00:56:02,485
Plan A is to switch from mediums
to hards, between lap 27 and 33.

852
00:56:02,568 --> 00:56:08,783
Plan B will be medium-hard-medium,
first window 16 to 21, second, 45 to 51.

853
00:56:08,866 --> 00:56:10,576
Plan C for softs
doesn't make sense.

854
00:56:10,659 --> 00:56:12,953
At this temp, the tire
deg will be too high.

855
00:56:14,705 --> 00:56:15,706
Nothing else?

856
00:56:16,290 --> 00:56:18,042
-Yep.
-Yeah, Joshua?

857
00:56:18,125 --> 00:56:20,253
So, we've just got to
drive our race, all right?

858
00:56:20,336 --> 00:56:21,337
Let's not try and be heroes.

859
00:56:21,420 --> 00:56:23,506
Just make it through
those first turns clean.

860
00:56:23,589 --> 00:56:25,717
Can't win at lap one,
starting at the back,

861
00:56:25,800 --> 00:56:28,970
so we just gotta hope for some
lucky breaks later on, all right?

862
00:56:29,053 --> 00:56:30,221
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

863
00:56:30,304 --> 00:56:31,972
Create your own breaks.

864
00:56:33,307 --> 00:56:35,226
Um, hello, hi? I just said that.

865
00:56:36,519 --> 00:56:37,812
Hope is not a strategy.

866
00:56:41,649 --> 00:56:43,067
Anything else, Professor?

867
00:56:43,984 --> 00:56:45,945
Um...

868
00:56:46,445 --> 00:56:47,530
Drive fast?

869
00:57:05,005 --> 00:57:07,258
It's lights out, and away we go.

870
00:57:07,341 --> 00:57:10,011
Great start from Hamilton,
Verstappen battling with him.

871
00:57:10,094 --> 00:57:13,556
Piastri, Zhou, Leclerc... and
here come the two Apex GPs.

872
00:57:14,515 --> 00:57:18,936
But Gasly shuts the door,
leaving them with nowhere to go.

873
00:57:25,317 --> 00:57:28,613
Into turn one, and there's
three cars gone off.

874
00:57:28,696 --> 00:57:31,824
Gasly, Ocon, and the
AlphaTauri, Tsunoda.

875
00:57:31,907 --> 00:57:33,201
Hit debris. Check my tires.

876
00:57:33,284 --> 00:57:35,995
Yeah, you've got a puncture.
Right rear. Box. Box this lap.

877
00:57:36,078 --> 00:57:38,247
First goddamn turn.
A ruined race.

878
00:57:39,206 --> 00:57:41,750
Oh, shit, shit, shit. Ah, shit.

879
00:57:45,254 --> 00:57:46,755
He's coming in! Let's go.

880
00:57:47,339 --> 00:57:48,758
Let's go Plan C.

881
00:57:48,841 --> 00:57:53,221
No, Plan C is for soft tires. They
won't last ten laps in this heat. No.

882
00:57:53,304 --> 00:57:54,472
That's a negative,
Sonny. Plan A.

883
00:57:54,555 --> 00:57:57,100
Plan A is called Plan A 'cause it's
when everything is going right.

884
00:57:57,183 --> 00:57:58,343
You see anything going right?

885
00:57:58,976 --> 00:58:00,561
Plan C. Softs.

886
00:58:00,644 --> 00:58:03,856
It's not his call. Tell
him A, as in "asshole."

887
00:58:04,607 --> 00:58:06,192
Okay, let's go! Turn
'em out! Hard tires.

888
00:58:06,275 --> 00:58:07,818
Softs, goddamn it.

889
00:58:13,240 --> 00:58:16,119
-What's wrong with the car?
-The guy sitting in it.

890
00:58:16,202 --> 00:58:20,915
Are you insane? We need hard tires.
Everybody here is at a one-stop race.

891
00:58:20,998 --> 00:58:23,167
We do what everybody
does, we lose.

892
00:58:24,877 --> 00:58:26,420
-Make him go!
-How?

893
00:58:27,171 --> 00:58:30,091
You think I don't know my
tires? I was a mechanic.

894
00:58:30,174 --> 00:58:33,969
Five championship titles
with my bare freaking hands!

895
00:58:37,014 --> 00:58:38,015
Give him his tires.

896
00:58:39,016 --> 00:58:40,852
-Okay, let's go.
-Go, go, change!

897
00:58:40,935 --> 00:58:42,645
Let's go, let's go!
Change quick, now!

898
00:58:47,983 --> 00:58:48,901
Be ready.

899
00:58:48,984 --> 00:58:50,694
Ready for what?

900
00:58:57,993 --> 00:59:01,080
-Where's JP sitting?
-Currently running P14.

901
00:59:03,374 --> 00:59:04,833
All right, here we go now.

902
00:59:05,334 --> 00:59:06,544
Hayes makes his move,

903
00:59:06,627 --> 00:59:09,213
chasing Kevin Magnussen.
It's a late lunge!

904
00:59:09,296 --> 00:59:10,882
He's damaged his front wing.

905
00:59:10,965 --> 00:59:15,803
Any driver knows Magnussen will shut
the door on a clumsy move like that.

906
00:59:15,886 --> 00:59:17,638
Aw, dagnabbit.

907
00:59:17,721 --> 00:59:19,222
Plan C for "chaos."

908
00:59:20,432 --> 00:59:23,728
So that will bring out a safety
car, which always shakes up a race.

909
00:59:23,811 --> 00:59:26,856
Slows down the leaders, leaves
the field bunched up together,

910
00:59:26,939 --> 00:59:29,275
and gives teams the chance
for a quick pit stop,

911
00:59:29,358 --> 00:59:31,694
which only costs
half the usual time.

912
00:59:31,777 --> 00:59:33,237
Safety car. We're boxing, right?

913
00:59:33,320 --> 00:59:34,572
Standby. Kate,

914
00:59:34,655 --> 00:59:37,033
shouldn't we take advantage while
the safety car window is open?

915
00:59:37,116 --> 00:59:39,202
It's early. We gain track
position if we stay out.

916
00:59:39,285 --> 00:59:42,663
Stay out, stay out. Want
you out. Push, push, Joshua.

917
00:59:42,746 --> 00:59:44,832
So, the midfield moves
up for the moment,

918
00:59:44,915 --> 00:59:47,334
including Joshua Pearce to P12.

919
00:59:48,002 --> 00:59:50,254
This guy better not
be messing up my race.

920
00:59:55,759 --> 00:59:56,677
Where's JP now?

921
00:59:56,760 --> 00:59:58,304
Currently running P12.

922
01:00:05,019 --> 01:00:06,979
Okay. Plan C. Be ready.

923
01:00:07,938 --> 01:00:09,356
He's gonna do it again.

924
01:00:13,027 --> 01:00:15,279
Back marker Hayes
is now down a lap.

925
01:00:15,362 --> 01:00:18,699
He has to let Bottas pass, or
face a five-second penalty.

926
01:00:18,782 --> 01:00:21,452
Hayes is making it very
difficult for Bottas.

927
01:00:21,535 --> 01:00:24,705
Under the rules he has to let him
through before passing three blue flags,

928
01:00:24,788 --> 01:00:26,457
or risk a penalty.

929
01:00:26,540 --> 01:00:29,835
Hey, I'm just putting it out there,
but, uh, maybe you should drive.

930
01:00:31,337 --> 01:00:34,089
Sonny, you've gotten the blue
flag. Let Bottas through.

931
01:00:34,965 --> 01:00:36,717
Come on, now. Little closer.

932
01:00:38,677 --> 01:00:40,179
Sonny, do you copy?

933
01:00:40,262 --> 01:00:42,056
I hear ya. Lettin' him through.

934
01:00:43,557 --> 01:00:44,809
Whoops, my bad.

935
01:00:44,892 --> 01:00:46,727
And that's his front wing again!

936
01:00:46,810 --> 01:00:49,689
Oh, that's gonna bring
out another safety car.

937
01:00:49,772 --> 01:00:52,733
Given that each wing
costs more than £200,000,

938
01:00:52,816 --> 01:00:55,611
I think the team might want
Sonny to start chipping in there.

939
01:01:00,824 --> 01:01:02,994
Guys, it's another free stop.
Please tell me we're boxing.

940
01:01:03,077 --> 01:01:04,537
Uh, we're checking.

941
01:01:04,620 --> 01:01:07,164
-Keep him out.
-Stay out. Stay out. You are staying out.

942
01:01:07,247 --> 01:01:09,500
More drivers come in
to take fresh tires,

943
01:01:09,583 --> 01:01:13,921
but still, Joshua Pearce remains
on track. He's moved up to P11.

944
01:01:16,757 --> 01:01:18,175
Look who's back.

945
01:01:21,929 --> 01:01:23,639
I know, I know. Be ready.

946
01:01:27,267 --> 01:01:28,435
What is he doing?

947
01:01:30,187 --> 01:01:31,787
I think he's trying
to score us a point.

948
01:01:34,024 --> 01:01:36,235
Tell JP to save his tires.

949
01:01:37,403 --> 01:01:39,989
Joshua, just take care
of your tires, okay?

950
01:01:40,072 --> 01:01:41,782
You have to make them last.

951
01:01:41,865 --> 01:01:44,743
Last? No shit. I will be.

952
01:01:47,871 --> 01:01:50,583
With four laps to go in
this stop-and-go race,

953
01:01:50,666 --> 01:01:51,834
thanks to Sonny Hayes,

954
01:01:51,917 --> 01:01:54,670
the driver helped most is
his teammate, now in tenth.

955
01:01:54,753 --> 01:01:57,756
With a 12-second
gap ahead of Stroll.

956
01:01:58,257 --> 01:02:00,134
Tell JP to maintain that gap.

957
01:02:00,217 --> 01:02:01,468
Keep pushing.

958
01:02:02,678 --> 01:02:05,139
My tires are gone, man.
What are you waiting for?

959
01:02:05,222 --> 01:02:07,016
Copy that. We have to call it.

960
01:02:07,099 --> 01:02:08,642
He's losing over a
second every lap.

961
01:02:09,351 --> 01:02:10,436
Stand by.

962
01:02:10,519 --> 01:02:14,273
Into turn two. Hayes battles with
the Williams and pushes it wide.

963
01:02:14,356 --> 01:02:16,316
Seriously, what
are we waiting for?

964
01:02:19,862 --> 01:02:20,821
Sonny's off the track.

965
01:02:20,904 --> 01:02:23,657
He's gone too far over.

966
01:02:23,740 --> 01:02:25,117
And that's gonna cause damage.

967
01:02:25,200 --> 01:02:27,953
Plan C.

968
01:02:28,579 --> 01:02:30,206
Oopsie. Sorry, guys.

969
01:02:30,289 --> 01:02:34,210
That's the third safety car
involving the Apex GP driver,

970
01:02:34,293 --> 01:02:37,463
bringing the Hungarian Grand
Prix to an absolute crawl.

971
01:02:38,005 --> 01:02:40,091
A sub three-second stop,
and he'll keep P10.

972
01:02:40,174 --> 01:02:41,509
Box, Joshua. Box, box, box.

973
01:02:41,592 --> 01:02:43,218
Copy. Coming in.

974
01:02:45,637 --> 01:02:46,764
What did you say?

975
01:02:46,847 --> 01:02:49,308
Joshua Pearce
finally gets to pit.

976
01:02:49,391 --> 01:02:53,145
And with a quick stop here,
he could stay in the top ten.

977
01:03:02,070 --> 01:03:04,073
This is critical.

978
01:03:04,156 --> 01:03:08,577
Pearce must beat Stroll to the pit
exit line to maintain tenth place.

979
01:03:10,120 --> 01:03:11,330
And he's done it!

980
01:03:11,413 --> 01:03:15,167
With yellow flags out, all the cars
are forced to hold track position,

981
01:03:15,250 --> 01:03:17,378
-meaning that thanks to Sonny Hayes...
-Let's go!

982
01:03:17,461 --> 01:03:19,672
-...the race ends under a safety car.
-Yeah!

983
01:03:19,755 --> 01:03:21,673
-Vegas!
-What? Whoa!

984
01:03:22,633 --> 01:03:24,927
Hey, yeah. Fuck you.

985
01:03:27,012 --> 01:03:29,265
Yeah!

986
01:03:29,348 --> 01:03:30,765
Yes, baby!

987
01:03:41,777 --> 01:03:43,362
You're crazy, bro.

988
01:03:43,445 --> 01:03:46,073
It's just tenth. What
are you smiling about?

989
01:03:48,408 --> 01:03:50,161
And behind our podium placings,

990
01:03:50,244 --> 01:03:52,830
Hamilton and Piastri
complete the top five,

991
01:03:52,913 --> 01:03:54,707
-and Joshua Pearce in tenth...
-Wow.

992
01:03:54,790 --> 01:03:57,418
-...scoring Expensify Apex GP...
-Yeah, baby.

993
01:03:57,501 --> 01:03:59,169
...their first ever point.

994
01:04:01,421 --> 01:04:03,966
Did you see me? Crazy, right?

995
01:04:04,049 --> 01:04:06,886
-A deal's a deal. I finished.
-Yeah, in last place.

996
01:04:06,969 --> 01:04:09,012
Sounds great when you say it.

997
01:04:15,185 --> 01:04:17,062
I know you have to go
see the stewards later,

998
01:04:17,145 --> 01:04:18,731
what do you think they're
gonna make of your race today?

999
01:04:18,814 --> 01:04:20,900
Well, I have to admit, you
guys got this one right.

1000
01:04:20,983 --> 01:04:23,819
-I'm, like... Thank you. Thank you.
-Good job. Yeah.

1001
01:04:24,361 --> 01:04:27,323
I'm still a bit rusty and, you
know, finding my way with this car,

1002
01:04:27,406 --> 01:04:28,824
but I'm confident
we'll get there.

1003
01:04:28,907 --> 01:04:32,786
A rope-a-dope at Silverstone, a
demolition derby here in Hungary...

1004
01:04:32,869 --> 01:04:34,163
You've been banned from casinos.

1005
01:04:34,246 --> 01:04:36,624
Are you trying to get banned from F1?
Take the whole team down with you?

1006
01:04:36,707 --> 01:04:39,001
Tell you what, Don, what
do you say we make a bet?

1007
01:04:39,084 --> 01:04:41,253
Your £10 against my 10 grand.

1008
01:04:41,336 --> 01:04:44,173
We place at Monza, I win your
10. We don't, you win mine.

1009
01:04:44,256 --> 01:04:45,841
Let's do this, man.

1010
01:04:45,924 --> 01:04:47,324
Put your money
where your mouth is.

1011
01:04:48,844 --> 01:04:50,346
What the hell? I'll take that.

1012
01:04:50,429 --> 01:04:52,181
-Thank you.
-Thank you so much.

1013
01:04:52,264 --> 01:04:54,850
Hey. No more press.

1014
01:04:54,933 --> 01:04:57,102
No, Sonny, you don't wanna
make the media your enemy.

1015
01:04:57,185 --> 01:04:58,437
And you'll be fined.

1016
01:04:58,520 --> 01:04:59,730
Take it out of my paycheck.

1017
01:05:00,314 --> 01:05:01,690
We don't pay you enough.

1018
01:05:02,816 --> 01:05:04,276
You know, I have to say.

1019
01:05:05,777 --> 01:05:06,820
I kinda like it.

1020
01:05:08,196 --> 01:05:11,532
It's very sort of punk
rock for the brand.

1021
01:05:14,620 --> 01:05:15,621
Hmm.

1022
01:05:24,421 --> 01:05:25,672
Let's run it again.

1023
01:05:34,139 --> 01:05:35,474
How long's he been in there?

1024
01:05:36,058 --> 01:05:39,645
All day. Playing with different
tire pressures, ride heights.

1025
01:05:40,979 --> 01:05:42,230
What were his times?

1026
01:05:42,731 --> 01:05:43,815
He found half a second.

1027
01:05:49,446 --> 01:05:50,781
Give me the same setup as him.

1028
01:06:12,344 --> 01:06:14,303
It must be late.
I'm seeing double.

1029
01:06:16,431 --> 01:06:18,892
A deal's a deal. I'm
building her for combat.

1030
01:06:20,435 --> 01:06:21,437
At the Dutch Grand Prix,

1031
01:06:21,520 --> 01:06:25,899
you'll be entering the Tarzan
Corner at 322 kilometers per hour.

1032
01:06:25,982 --> 01:06:28,152
Yeah. Too late to
change my mind?

1033
01:06:28,235 --> 01:06:29,945
Yeah.

1034
01:06:36,368 --> 01:06:38,078
To answer your question,

1035
01:06:38,161 --> 01:06:41,915
I was in aerospace at Lockheed
when Ruben came in and...

1036
01:06:42,916 --> 01:06:44,918
He liked my work,
liked my attitude,

1037
01:06:45,001 --> 01:06:49,214
and he sold me on the thrill of fighting
to the death for a tenth of a second.

1038
01:06:50,424 --> 01:06:53,760
Traveling the world,
the roar of a crowd...

1039
01:06:54,344 --> 01:06:57,389
So, I ran the idea
past my husband.

1040
01:06:59,975 --> 01:07:02,769
Who swiftly became
my ex-husband.

1041
01:07:05,188 --> 01:07:06,189
Good night.

1042
01:07:07,149 --> 01:07:08,150
Good night.

1043
01:07:33,175 --> 01:07:34,760
Do you know what time it is?

1044
01:07:35,594 --> 01:07:36,804
All right.

1045
01:07:36,887 --> 01:07:38,472
Tell me about the kid.

1046
01:07:45,312 --> 01:07:47,106
Okay, here's another
one my dad would say.

1047
01:07:47,189 --> 01:07:49,399
"Slow is smooth,
smooth is fast."

1048
01:07:50,317 --> 01:07:52,611
For what it's worth.
One more time around?

1049
01:07:52,694 --> 01:07:55,781
Just one? Come on. Is that all?

1050
01:07:55,864 --> 01:07:57,366
I'd never live with myself,

1051
01:07:57,449 --> 01:07:59,868
if I can't keep up
with you, Mr. 1990s.

1052
01:07:59,951 --> 01:08:01,578
Let's go!

1053
01:08:02,120 --> 01:08:04,373
Joining us today, we
have Kaspar Smolinski,

1054
01:08:04,456 --> 01:08:06,583
Zak Brown and Fred Vasseur.

1055
01:08:06,666 --> 01:08:10,087
Now, Kaspar, can we start with you,
after what was a fantastic result

1056
01:08:10,170 --> 01:08:12,506
-for the team in Hungary last time out...
-Thank you.

1057
01:08:12,589 --> 01:08:17,803
...but Sonny has got you skirting
the line of penalties and violations.

1058
01:08:17,886 --> 01:08:20,097
Is this your only strategy,

1059
01:08:20,180 --> 01:08:23,182
and have you got any spare
parts left in the factory?

1060
01:08:24,768 --> 01:08:26,145
We compete like everybody else.

1061
01:08:26,228 --> 01:08:27,563
Race models change.

1062
01:08:27,646 --> 01:08:29,314
We must adapt, huh?

1063
01:08:29,898 --> 01:08:31,358
Well, Zak, can we
bring you in on this?

1064
01:08:31,441 --> 01:08:36,655
Because you've faced Hayes before, you
know the gray areas in which he works.

1065
01:08:37,405 --> 01:08:40,534
Certainly do. Uh, first of
all, he's a lot grayer now.

1066
01:08:40,617 --> 01:08:42,619
And, uh, we keep tabs on him,

1067
01:08:42,702 --> 01:08:43,996
you know, back there behind us.

1068
01:08:44,079 --> 01:08:47,166
And Fred, any
concerns from Ferrari?

1069
01:08:47,249 --> 01:08:49,417
What does Ferrari think of Apex?

1070
01:08:50,168 --> 01:08:53,212
We don't.

1071
01:09:07,227 --> 01:09:09,688
Sonny!

1072
01:09:11,231 --> 01:09:12,231
You're the best!

1073
01:09:14,150 --> 01:09:16,904
A better qualifying yesterday
gets us in the thick of things.

1074
01:09:16,987 --> 01:09:19,448
P10, P15.

1075
01:09:19,531 --> 01:09:21,241
So we're gonna go
for a two stop.

1076
01:09:21,324 --> 01:09:26,121
Medium-hard-medium, that's plan A.
Final stint, we go hards for plan B.

1077
01:09:26,204 --> 01:09:28,499
So, on this, do you
have any track concerns?

1078
01:09:28,582 --> 01:09:30,667
Don't look at me. Look at him.

1079
01:09:32,460 --> 01:09:33,712
It's good for JP.

1080
01:09:34,254 --> 01:09:35,255
Start me on hards.

1081
01:09:36,131 --> 01:09:38,759
Nah, the track's cooled down.
You won't have any grip.

1082
01:09:38,842 --> 01:09:40,218
That's right.

1083
01:09:40,886 --> 01:09:43,638
For three weeks, all the
talk's been how reckless I am.

1084
01:09:44,222 --> 01:09:46,725
Everyone's wondering if I'm
gonna drive 'em off track,

1085
01:09:46,808 --> 01:09:49,352
which means no one's gonna
be watching out for him.

1086
01:09:51,479 --> 01:09:55,025
Today, you win us this race.

1087
01:10:02,324 --> 01:10:05,577
Twenty laps down here at Monza,
and the pack have been split.

1088
01:10:05,660 --> 01:10:08,372
The leaders are pulling
away, led by Max Verstappen,

1089
01:10:08,455 --> 01:10:10,916
with Joshua Pearce back in P10.

1090
01:10:10,999 --> 01:10:13,710
Meanwhile, Sonny Hayes is
holding up the rest of the pack,

1091
01:10:13,793 --> 01:10:16,212
stuck behind him in a DRS train.

1092
01:10:17,172 --> 01:10:20,759
Pearce looks to be in a great
position to finish in the top ten,

1093
01:10:20,842 --> 01:10:23,845
and maybe even a
run to the podium.

1094
01:10:25,931 --> 01:10:28,016
But there's still a long
way to go in this race,

1095
01:10:28,099 --> 01:10:32,145
and with rain potentially
forecast, anything can happen.

1096
01:10:32,729 --> 01:10:34,022
Tires are gone. Coming in.

1097
01:10:34,105 --> 01:10:35,523
Yeah, copy. Box. Box.

1098
01:10:36,107 --> 01:10:38,527
Apex GP is prepping a fresh
set of tires for Hayes.

1099
01:10:38,610 --> 01:10:42,364
That's gonna bring in all the
other teams to avoid the undercut.

1100
01:10:42,447 --> 01:10:44,032
Uh, changed my mind.

1101
01:10:44,115 --> 01:10:47,661
But, no! He's staying out, with
the cars behind him all scrambling

1102
01:10:47,744 --> 01:10:52,207
to get on fresh tires that apparently
he doesn't think he needs anymore.

1103
01:10:52,290 --> 01:10:54,793
Should we just do the opposite
of what he tells us to do?

1104
01:10:54,876 --> 01:10:56,920
Stand by till I lose my tires.

1105
01:10:57,963 --> 01:11:01,049
-I thought he had lost his tires.
-I think he means literally.

1106
01:11:04,010 --> 01:11:05,929
Puncture, left rear. Coming in.

1107
01:11:06,012 --> 01:11:07,973
And there goes Hayes's tires.

1108
01:11:08,056 --> 01:11:10,475
That's quite a mess,
gravel on the track.

1109
01:11:10,558 --> 01:11:13,937
That will bring out the virtual
safety car for a quick sweep.

1110
01:11:14,020 --> 01:11:15,480
So the race gets neutralized.

1111
01:11:15,563 --> 01:11:19,276
Everyone slows down to
40% of their racing speed,

1112
01:11:19,359 --> 01:11:21,361
and all the race strategies
will get a reset.

1113
01:11:21,444 --> 01:11:24,489
And that is why this is the
perfect time to take a pit stop.

1114
01:11:24,572 --> 01:11:25,949
While you're in the pit lane,

1115
01:11:26,032 --> 01:11:29,077
your opponents are restricted
to a much slower pace

1116
01:11:29,160 --> 01:11:31,872
and you're not going to lose as
much track position when you rejoin.

1117
01:11:31,955 --> 01:11:35,208
-I take it I'm staying out, right?
-Copy. Joshua, stay out. Stay out.

1118
01:11:35,291 --> 01:11:37,961
-We want you out to gain track position.
-Copy.

1119
01:11:38,044 --> 01:11:40,130
Up is down, down is up.

1120
01:11:47,095 --> 01:11:50,265
Sonny Hayes hesitated
before he left his pit box,

1121
01:11:50,348 --> 01:11:53,185
and he's come out just in
front of Max Verstappen.

1122
01:11:53,268 --> 01:11:54,519
That was naughty.

1123
01:11:54,602 --> 01:11:56,813
Hayes has slowed a
bit in the pit lane,

1124
01:11:56,896 --> 01:12:00,859
which will cost the Red Bull and
the two Ferraris precious time.

1125
01:12:00,942 --> 01:12:02,152
Push, Joshua. Push.

1126
01:12:02,235 --> 01:12:03,779
You are now P4. P4.

1127
01:12:03,862 --> 01:12:08,158
Who's coming up from behind?
Here he is, Joshua Pearce.

1128
01:12:08,241 --> 01:12:10,035
-Let's see! Let's go!
-Yes!

1129
01:12:10,118 --> 01:12:11,745
-This is all playing into his hands...
-Wow.

1130
01:12:11,828 --> 01:12:14,206
...at the moment. Could
be a dream afternoon.

1131
01:12:14,289 --> 01:12:17,167
But can Hayes hold Verstappen
for a little bit longer?

1132
01:12:17,250 --> 01:12:20,295
Verstappen tries into turn
one, nothing doing there.

1133
01:12:20,378 --> 01:12:23,173
Gets the better exit. Through
the Curva Grande we go.

1134
01:12:23,256 --> 01:12:25,509
-Damn, he's good.
-Verstappen's trying to get past.

1135
01:12:25,592 --> 01:12:27,552
Sonny Hayes looking
carefully in his mirrors.

1136
01:12:27,635 --> 01:12:29,888
He must let Max
Verstappen through.

1137
01:12:29,971 --> 01:12:31,598
Yeah, I deserved that.

1138
01:12:31,681 --> 01:12:33,976
And Max shows his disapproval,

1139
01:12:34,059 --> 01:12:37,729
and I don't blame him, as they head
down towards the second chicane.

1140
01:12:37,812 --> 01:12:40,440
And through goes
Joshua Pearce in P4,

1141
01:12:40,523 --> 01:12:43,233
now much closer to
the front of the pack.

1142
01:12:46,154 --> 01:12:48,865
Just seven laps to go,
and here comes the rain.

1143
01:12:48,948 --> 01:12:52,077
Let's see who plays it safe with
a switch to the intermediate tire,

1144
01:12:52,160 --> 01:12:54,788
and who might gamble
to stay out on slicks.

1145
01:13:01,211 --> 01:13:02,921
It's getting tricky out
here, guys. What's the plan?

1146
01:13:03,004 --> 01:13:06,925
You're running P4. We think P2 and P3
are switching to inters for safety,

1147
01:13:07,008 --> 01:13:08,719
and it looks like
P1 is staying out.

1148
01:13:08,802 --> 01:13:10,682
-What do you wanna do?
-What's Sonny gonna do?

1149
01:13:11,513 --> 01:13:12,848
Take a wild guess.

1150
01:13:12,931 --> 01:13:14,474
-I'm staying out.
-Copy that.

1151
01:13:15,642 --> 01:13:18,937
And the two Ferraris come
in for intermediate tires.

1152
01:13:19,020 --> 01:13:21,398
Let's see who else
decides to play it safe.

1153
01:13:21,481 --> 01:13:25,526
And as George Russell pits,
Joshua Pearce moves into P2.

1154
01:13:27,153 --> 01:13:29,614
Sonny, Joshua is staying out on slicks.
If he can hold on and find a dry line,

1155
01:13:29,697 --> 01:13:30,782
he's gonna finish second.

1156
01:13:30,865 --> 01:13:31,991
Second's not enough.

1157
01:13:33,368 --> 01:13:34,494
Damn it.

1158
01:13:35,036 --> 01:13:36,663
Okay, coming in for inters.

1159
01:13:36,746 --> 01:13:39,457
-Inters, inters.
-Let's go! He's coming in!

1160
01:13:45,964 --> 01:13:48,341
-How far behind me are they?
-Thirty seconds.

1161
01:13:48,883 --> 01:13:50,677
Oh, my God. He's gonna
take out Verstappen.

1162
01:13:50,760 --> 01:13:52,512
Let me know when they
hit the main straight.

1163
01:13:52,595 --> 01:13:56,016
Don't tell him! They penalize both
cars. They will take the win away.

1164
01:13:56,099 --> 01:13:57,183
Just trust me, will ya?

1165
01:13:59,686 --> 01:14:01,605
I'm pushing but I
can't catch him.

1166
01:14:01,688 --> 01:14:03,690
As the race leaders
approach the main straight,

1167
01:14:03,773 --> 01:14:07,069
Sonny Hayes is in another
standoff over team strategy.

1168
01:14:07,152 --> 01:14:08,695
-Now.
-No!

1169
01:14:09,988 --> 01:14:12,532
Finally, Hayes back
out onto the track,

1170
01:14:12,615 --> 01:14:14,367
and just in front of Verstappen.

1171
01:14:14,450 --> 01:14:17,496
Now he'll get a blue flag here
so Verstappen can get past,

1172
01:14:17,579 --> 01:14:22,000
but until then, the Dutch driver
is caught up in Hayes's dirty air.

1173
01:14:22,083 --> 01:14:24,002
With every turn he hangs on,

1174
01:14:24,085 --> 01:14:26,588
he slows Verstappen a
fraction of a second,

1175
01:14:26,671 --> 01:14:30,092
providing Joshua Pearce one
last chance to catch up.

1176
01:14:30,175 --> 01:14:31,467
I can see him. I'm almost there.

1177
01:14:33,386 --> 01:14:34,304
Tell JP to follow me.

1178
01:14:34,387 --> 01:14:38,474
-Copy. Uh, Joshua, Sonny is your tow.
-I'm right behind him.

1179
01:14:39,642 --> 01:14:41,186
Verstappen pulls away then.

1180
01:14:41,269 --> 01:14:44,064
But now, onto the rear
wing of his teammate's car

1181
01:14:44,147 --> 01:14:45,482
comes Joshua Pearce.

1182
01:14:45,565 --> 01:14:47,984
Pearce picks up the
slipstream from Hayes,

1183
01:14:48,067 --> 01:14:51,237
gaining time, but driving
blind in the spray.

1184
01:14:53,907 --> 01:14:56,034
Come on. Stay with
me. Stay with me now.

1185
01:15:02,624 --> 01:15:03,708
Pass. Pass.

1186
01:15:03,791 --> 01:15:05,252
-Overtake him. Overtake.
-Copy.

1187
01:15:05,335 --> 01:15:10,090
He's been gaining, and boom! Joshua
Pearce slingshots past Sonny Hayes,

1188
01:15:10,173 --> 01:15:13,260
and now is in striking
distance of P1.

1189
01:15:13,343 --> 01:15:15,804
Tell JP to wait for the
straight into turn one.

1190
01:15:15,887 --> 01:15:17,264
Be patient.

1191
01:15:17,347 --> 01:15:19,474
-Straight at turn one.
-Copy.

1192
01:15:19,557 --> 01:15:23,895
Joshua, Sonny says wait for the
straight. The straight into turn one.

1193
01:15:25,396 --> 01:15:27,107
I'm right there.

1194
01:15:27,190 --> 01:15:28,483
I've got him.

1195
01:15:29,359 --> 01:15:31,695
Pearce is right on the
gearbox of Verstappen,

1196
01:15:31,778 --> 01:15:34,614
down the back straight at
over 200 miles an hour.

1197
01:15:34,697 --> 01:15:36,199
I see an opening. Going for it.

1198
01:15:36,824 --> 01:15:38,910
The rookie attacks in 11.

1199
01:15:39,410 --> 01:15:40,411
No, no!

1200
01:15:41,871 --> 01:15:43,498
Pearce pulls alongside
the Red Bull,

1201
01:15:43,581 --> 01:15:46,293
he's wheels ahead, for
the first time ever...

1202
01:15:46,376 --> 01:15:49,296
Apex GP... Oh, no!

1203
01:15:49,379 --> 01:15:50,838
No!

1204
01:17:26,768 --> 01:17:28,686
For God's sake.

1205
01:17:37,987 --> 01:17:40,532
Bernadette, how's he doing?

1206
01:17:40,615 --> 01:17:41,866
He's stable.

1207
01:17:41,949 --> 01:17:43,701
He's resting now.

1208
01:17:47,080 --> 01:17:48,581
Very happy to hear it.

1209
01:17:48,664 --> 01:17:51,167
I'm so sorry for what
happened. It was clearly...

1210
01:17:51,250 --> 01:17:53,503
Sonny, over here, please.

1211
01:18:08,017 --> 01:18:10,770
Um, I just wanna
say I've been...

1212
01:18:10,853 --> 01:18:12,522
Joshua says you're an asshole.

1213
01:18:15,149 --> 01:18:16,568
Yeah, that tracks.

1214
01:18:16,651 --> 01:18:19,112
I think you're a
dangerous asshole.

1215
01:18:21,072 --> 01:18:23,616
-Ms. Pearce...
-You're part of the same team, right?

1216
01:18:23,699 --> 01:18:24,909
Looking out for each other.

1217
01:18:24,992 --> 01:18:27,704
Except you had him doing
something so dangerous

1218
01:18:27,787 --> 01:18:30,039
it almost got him killed.

1219
01:18:31,499 --> 01:18:34,544
-Okay, listen...
-No, you listen to me.

1220
01:18:35,378 --> 01:18:37,296
This is my son.

1221
01:18:38,423 --> 01:18:40,592
And if anything... anything
else happens to him,

1222
01:18:40,675 --> 01:18:42,010
I'm coming after you.

1223
01:18:42,093 --> 01:18:44,679
And you better pray I don't
put you in a bed next to Joshua

1224
01:18:44,762 --> 01:18:46,889
for a very, very long time.

1225
01:18:47,640 --> 01:18:48,641
Clear?

1226
01:18:51,102 --> 01:18:52,437
Sure.

1227
01:19:09,871 --> 01:19:10,914
Sonny, Sonny.

1228
01:19:10,997 --> 01:19:13,958
Do you think Joshua blames you
for what happened in Monza?

1229
01:19:17,670 --> 01:19:20,548
Sonny, come on.

1230
01:19:20,631 --> 01:19:22,926
It was clear that you
were running his race.

1231
01:19:23,009 --> 01:19:26,554
Look, you kept him out on slick
tires, in dangerous conditions,

1232
01:19:26,637 --> 01:19:30,308
that even if you told him not to
pass, wasn't the accident inevitable?

1233
01:19:30,391 --> 01:19:32,435
If I may. If I may.

1234
01:19:32,518 --> 01:19:34,562
Joshua's back home, recovering.

1235
01:19:34,645 --> 01:19:36,815
We are expecting his
return in a few weeks.

1236
01:19:36,898 --> 01:19:42,737
Until that moment, our reserve driver,
Luca Cortez right there, will drive and...

1237
01:19:42,820 --> 01:19:45,490
-Next man up.
-Answer the question!

1238
01:19:47,867 --> 01:19:50,870
A chaotic week for
Expensify Apex GP,

1239
01:19:50,953 --> 01:19:53,832
and again, it's Sonny
Hayes at the center.

1240
01:19:53,915 --> 01:19:57,585
Many are blaming him for his
teammate's horrific accident at Monza.

1241
01:19:57,668 --> 01:20:02,173
His high-stakes, gambling style of
racing has the whole grid on edge,

1242
01:20:02,256 --> 01:20:06,094
and while the controversy
continues over who was to blame,

1243
01:20:06,177 --> 01:20:09,681
doctors have said that Pearce
will miss the next three races,

1244
01:20:09,764 --> 01:20:14,185
due to the burns suffered on his hands
as he begins his road to recovery.

1245
01:20:21,692 --> 01:20:24,070
Today, we're going with
our combat upgrade.

1246
01:20:24,737 --> 01:20:28,074
The revised shapes will improve
the flow field under the floor,

1247
01:20:28,157 --> 01:20:32,036
allowing us to run in dirty air
with minimal loss of performance.

1248
01:20:32,119 --> 01:20:34,914
Means we have to keep the
field close at all times,

1249
01:20:35,414 --> 01:20:38,751
and as for this week's plan C...

1250
01:20:44,799 --> 01:20:48,428
They've docked us to the back of the grid
'cause they don't like the way we drive.

1251
01:20:48,511 --> 01:20:50,555
Fine. Fuck 'em.

1252
01:20:51,472 --> 01:20:54,601
'Cause if we can pick up a
tenth of a second from you,

1253
01:20:54,684 --> 01:20:58,354
and from you, and you, and me...

1254
01:20:58,437 --> 01:21:01,149
If everyone in this room can
make one critical contribution,

1255
01:21:01,232 --> 01:21:02,608
that's a second every lap.

1256
01:21:03,317 --> 01:21:07,863
And after 72 laps, that's the
difference between last and first.

1257
01:21:09,907 --> 01:21:11,033
Plan C...

1258
01:21:12,660 --> 01:21:14,328
Plan C's for combat.

1259
01:21:16,831 --> 01:21:21,586
Combat, combat, combat.

1260
01:21:21,669 --> 01:21:27,465

Now the team were penalized
back to last place after Monza,

1268
01:21:54,869 --> 01:21:59,123

And here's where the Apex
GP has found strength.

1280
01:22:53,469 --> 01:22:56,722
Three-tenths gained every

Sonny Hayes gets the inside line,
but he can't quite get past.

1284
01:23:05,940 --> 01:23:08,568
George Russell will hang
on here for sixth place,

1285
01:23:08,651 --> 01:23:11,946
but this is Apex GP's
best ever finish.

1286
01:23:12,029 --> 01:23:15,490
-It's a valiant seventh.
-Combat, I love it!

1287

Every race you miss,
fans just forget you.

1288
01:23:21,080 --> 01:23:23,332
Sonny always seems

may be a saboteur, Josh.

Verstappen will have the inside.
Perez goes round the outside.

1296
01:23:47,440 --> 01:23:49,776
Perez makes contact
with Charles Leclerc

1297
01:23:49,859 --> 01:23:54,405

Hayes squeezes through on the inside,
and with a run to the line now,

1309
01:24:29,440 --> 01:24:32,360
for their best
position ever, P5.

1310

And if Joshua
Pearce is watching,

01:24:39,450 --> 01:24:42,370

and everyone keeping it clean
as into La Source we go.

1338
01:26:44,283 --> 01:26:45,785
Ferrari ahead of Red Bull,

1339
01:26:45,868 --> 01:26:50,790
but here the two Apex GP cars
looking to work together as a team.

1340
01:26:50,873 --> 01:26:54,585
It's a welcome back to the
track for Joshua Pearce,

1341
01:26:54,668 --> 01:26:56,295
and Sonny Hayes glad to see him,

1342
01:26:56,378 --> 01:27:00,007
as they slice their way through
positions four and five.

1343
01:27:00,090 --> 01:27:02,134
And onto the Kemmel
Straight we go.

1344
01:27:02,843 --> 01:27:07,223
Now approaching top speed, Sonny
Hayes ahead of Joshua Pearce.

1345
01:27:07,306 --> 01:27:10,810
He's showing no ill effects from
that time off after the crash.

1346
01:27:10,893 --> 01:27:14,438
The car's working beautifully.
They're working as a team.

1347
01:27:14,521 --> 01:27:18,359
But hang on, Pearce right on
his tail, using the slipstream.

1348
01:27:18,442 --> 01:27:20,778
Is he about to try and overtake?

1349
01:27:20,861 --> 01:27:23,614
Into the chicane we go
and they touch wheels!

1350
01:27:23,697 --> 01:27:25,616
This is disaster for Apex...

1351
01:27:25,699 --> 01:27:29,536
...as out goes Sonny
Hayes and into the gravel!

1352
01:27:30,996 --> 01:27:32,289
Assholes!

1353
01:27:32,873 --> 01:27:35,334
What is happening
with this team?

1354
01:27:35,417 --> 01:27:39,755
Their first race back together,
and they've run into each other.

1355
01:27:41,882 --> 01:27:43,562
-You did great, Joshua.
-Well done, mate.

1356
01:27:44,426 --> 01:27:45,719
Whoo!

1357
01:27:46,303 --> 01:27:48,514
You pull that shit again, I
will knock your teeth out.

1358
01:27:48,597 --> 01:27:50,349
Oh, no one gets past us
without a fight, right?

1359
01:27:50,432 --> 01:27:52,518
Oh, is this funny? You think
you got a seat next year?

1360
01:27:52,601 --> 01:27:54,645
'Cause you just cut
your chances in half.

1361
01:27:54,728 --> 01:27:57,106
-That's how dumb you are.
-You failed. You failed!

1362
01:27:57,189 --> 01:27:59,069
-Why should I listen to you anyway, man?
-Hey.

1363
01:28:01,110 --> 01:28:03,738
Look, man. I don't give
two shits about you.

1364
01:28:03,821 --> 01:28:06,073
You wanna sabotage your
career, you go right ahead.

1365
01:28:06,156 --> 01:28:08,492
I've seen hundreds of guys
with your talent come and go.

1366
01:28:08,575 --> 01:28:10,119
No one cares!

1367
01:28:10,995 --> 01:28:14,665
But you sabotage Ruben, who
backed you? You sabotage his team?

1368
01:28:16,083 --> 01:28:17,251
I won't let you do it.

1369
01:28:22,464 --> 01:28:25,885
-Thanks, coach.
-Get your shit together!

1370
01:28:25,968 --> 01:28:28,721
So stupid! God...

1371
01:28:36,854 --> 01:28:38,230
How would you sum
up your race today?

1372
01:28:38,313 --> 01:28:41,192
Ooh. Um, it was good.

1373
01:28:41,275 --> 01:28:44,528
You know, the car feels great. I
think the team's done an amazing job.

1374
01:28:45,237 --> 01:28:47,322
It's just a shame about
the contact with Sonny.

1375
01:28:48,407 --> 01:28:49,700
You hate to see that happen.

1376
01:29:17,269 --> 01:29:18,938
-Hey, how are you doing?
-Hi, how are you?

1377
01:29:19,021 --> 01:29:20,564
Good. Sensational.

1378
01:29:22,941 --> 01:29:24,985
-Where's the team?
-Right this way, gentlemen.

1379
01:29:35,746 --> 01:29:38,665
Brilliant, you made
it. Come on. Sit down.

1380
01:29:40,834 --> 01:29:42,503
Sonny, you know Joshua.

1381
01:29:42,586 --> 01:29:44,505
Joshua, Sonny.

1382
01:29:45,089 --> 01:29:46,924
So I'm sure you both
have heard the rumors.

1383
01:29:47,007 --> 01:29:49,969
We all lose our jobs if you
can't pull off a miracle,

1384
01:29:50,052 --> 01:29:52,096
and that's starting with
staying on the bloody track.

1385
01:29:52,179 --> 01:29:54,223
Well, we were doing just
fine while JP was out.

1386
01:29:54,306 --> 01:29:55,641
I was out because I
was listening to you.

1387
01:29:55,724 --> 01:29:57,143
-Ish.
-And please don't call me JP.

1388
01:29:57,226 --> 01:29:58,769
It's a nickname. You
don't get to choose.

1389
01:29:58,852 --> 01:30:01,188
And your name doesn't even make
sense. Is it Sonny, is it Hayesie?

1390
01:30:01,271 --> 01:30:02,356
We don't know, do we, Kate?

1391
01:30:02,439 --> 01:30:03,524
Lads.

1392
01:30:04,024 --> 01:30:05,359
Have I not delivered you a car?

1393
01:30:08,529 --> 01:30:10,406
So you can do one thing for me.

1394
01:30:10,489 --> 01:30:11,782
Cards.

1395
01:30:12,449 --> 01:30:14,284
Come on. I know you
have 'em with ya.

1396
01:30:15,327 --> 01:30:17,163
It's my team meeting,
we're gonna do it my way.

1397
01:30:17,246 --> 01:30:19,123
-We're playing poker.
-Come on.

1398
01:30:19,206 --> 01:30:21,917
Yeah. Whoever wins gets to be
our number one driver tomorrow,

1399
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:24,044
and if I win, I get to choose.

1400
01:30:26,130 --> 01:30:27,965
-Didn't he gamble for a living?
-Mm-hmm, yeah.

1401
01:30:28,048 --> 01:30:29,507
Now he's living in a van.

1402
01:30:31,552 --> 01:30:32,553
Texas Hold'em?

1403
01:30:46,942 --> 01:30:49,153
So, Sonny here
likes straight talk.

1404
01:30:49,236 --> 01:30:50,821
Isn't that right, Sonny?

1405
01:30:50,904 --> 01:30:53,157
-Yeah, that's what I hear.
-So, let's talk.

1406
01:30:53,240 --> 01:30:54,325
Who wants to go first?

1407
01:30:54,408 --> 01:30:56,118
-I'll go first.
-I'll go first.

1408
01:30:56,201 --> 01:30:57,787
No, I'll go first.

1409
01:30:57,870 --> 01:31:01,207
What's the difference between
Joshua Pearce and Sonny Hayes?

1410
01:31:01,290 --> 01:31:02,291
A lot of decades.

1411
01:31:02,374 --> 01:31:04,668
-Hard-won experience.
-Of living in a van?

1412
01:31:04,751 --> 01:31:05,961
Total freedom.

1413
01:31:06,044 --> 01:31:07,171
Total failure.

1414
01:31:07,880 --> 01:31:09,465
Says the guy who still
lives with his mom.

1415
01:31:09,548 --> 01:31:10,966
Says the guy with two pair.

1416
01:31:11,049 --> 01:31:14,052
-Says the guy with trips.
-Says the guy with a full house.

1417
01:31:16,305 --> 01:31:18,015
Girl.

1418
01:31:18,098 --> 01:31:19,850
Wait, I don't even
live with my mum.

1419
01:31:19,933 --> 01:31:21,018
Okay.

1420
01:31:21,602 --> 01:31:23,020
She just cooks for me sometimes.

1421
01:31:23,103 --> 01:31:24,438
Mm-hmm.

1422
01:31:26,356 --> 01:31:29,026
If you'd any constructive criticism
for each other, what would it be?

1423
01:31:29,109 --> 01:31:31,309
-Don't be such an arsehole.
-Don't be such a dickhead.

1424
01:31:32,988 --> 01:31:33,988
That was constructive.

1425
01:31:36,909 --> 01:31:39,369
You have a deficient
frontal cortex.

1426
01:31:41,079 --> 01:31:42,873
-A what?
-You can't analyze risk.

1427
01:31:42,956 --> 01:31:46,335
It's not all your fault. It's
not fully formed yet at your age.

1428
01:31:46,418 --> 01:31:48,003
But come the day
you learn patience,

1429
01:31:48,086 --> 01:31:50,255
-and stop being so immature, thinking...
-Patience.

1430
01:31:50,839 --> 01:31:52,341
-Patience is good.
-Patience.

1431
01:31:53,342 --> 01:31:54,593
Joshua.

1432
01:31:55,844 --> 01:31:58,139
He doesn't care about what anyone
else has to say but himself.

1433
01:31:58,222 --> 01:32:01,559
He just comes in and imposes his
will on all of us with no discussion.

1434
01:32:01,642 --> 01:32:04,270
He doesn't listen. I'm
trying, but he doesn't listen.

1435
01:32:04,353 --> 01:32:05,479
Mmm.

1436
01:32:06,063 --> 01:32:08,439

01:38:27,861 --> 01:38:29,487
I was gonna be world champion.

1522
01:38:31,114 --> 01:38:32,616
The best there ever was.

1523
01:38:34,075 --> 01:38:36,411
I'm just a kid and I'm on
the track with my idols,

1524
01:38:36,494 --> 01:38:38,705
Senna, Mansell, Prost.

1525
01:38:38,788 --> 01:38:40,457
And I am quick.

1526
01:38:41,875 --> 01:38:43,335
I'm fearless.

1527
01:38:45,170 --> 01:38:46,463
I was next.

1528
01:38:49,466 --> 01:38:50,467
And then...

1529
01:38:53,887 --> 01:38:55,430
...it was all taken away.

1530
01:38:57,766 --> 01:38:59,142
The crash, huh?

1531
01:39:00,727 --> 01:39:04,522
So I lost my seat, my
money, my sanity, my...

1532
01:39:05,482 --> 01:39:06,775
myself, really.

1533
01:39:07,734 --> 01:39:12,739
Just became this angry,
resentful shithead.

1534
01:39:12,822 --> 01:39:16,576
Not someone I'm
particularly proud of.

1535
01:39:20,955 --> 01:39:23,166
Till one day, I realized
what I had really lost,

1536
01:39:23,249 --> 01:39:28,297
and it wasn't the titles, or
the trophies, or the records.

1537
01:39:28,380 --> 01:39:31,800
It was my love for racing.

1538
01:39:34,427 --> 01:39:36,137
So I started driving.

1539
01:39:37,138 --> 01:39:40,601
Didn't matter the car, the circuit,
didn't need anyone to watch.

1540
01:39:40,684 --> 01:39:44,646
Just as long as I was behind
the wheel, I was good.

1541
01:39:47,816 --> 01:39:49,275
Sometimes...

1542
01:39:58,576 --> 01:40:01,454
What? Come on.

1543
01:40:04,833 --> 01:40:10,213
It's rare, but sometimes,
there's this moment in the car

1544
01:40:10,296 --> 01:40:13,007
where everything goes quiet,

1545
01:40:13,883 --> 01:40:15,510
my heartbeat slows,

1546
01:40:16,928 --> 01:40:18,388
it's peaceful,

1547
01:40:19,055 --> 01:40:22,100
and I can see
everything, and no one...

1548
01:40:22,642 --> 01:40:24,269
no one can touch me.

1549
01:40:27,313 --> 01:40:30,275
And I am chasing that moment
every time I get in the car.

1550
01:40:33,361 --> 01:40:37,991
I don't know when I'll find
it again, but, man, I want to.

1551
01:40:38,783 --> 01:40:40,243
I want to.

1552
01:40:41,745 --> 01:40:44,956
'Cause in that
moment, I'm flying.

1553
01:41:07,061 --> 01:41:08,062
Kate.

1554
01:41:08,605 --> 01:41:10,357
-Ruben.
-Where is he?

1555
01:41:10,440 --> 01:41:11,649
Where's who?

1556
01:41:12,484 --> 01:41:13,985
What are you talking about?

1557
01:41:15,737 --> 01:41:17,155
Ruben, seriously?

1558
01:41:18,114 --> 01:41:20,534
One, how dare you?

1559
01:41:20,617 --> 01:41:23,369
Two, I respect
professional boundaries.

1560
01:41:24,162 --> 01:41:25,163
And three...

1561
01:41:27,540 --> 01:41:29,300
Three, yeah, he's on...
he's on the balcony.

1562
01:41:32,378 --> 01:41:34,005
-Well, you're up early.
-Get dressed.

1563
01:41:34,088 --> 01:41:36,424
-Yeah, what's going on?
-They're coming for our car.

1564
01:41:40,011 --> 01:41:42,973
It's my duty to inform you that
we've received an anonymous tip

1565
01:41:43,056 --> 01:41:45,225
that your upgraded
floor is in violation.

1566
01:41:45,308 --> 01:41:46,518
From who?

1567
01:41:46,601 --> 01:41:48,270
-I can't say.
-Ah.

1568
01:41:48,353 --> 01:41:51,106
Sir, we submitted the
drawings long ago.

1569
01:41:51,189 --> 01:41:52,190
-Right?
-Mm-hmm.

1570
01:41:52,273 --> 01:41:53,442
And you approved them all.

1571
01:41:53,525 --> 01:41:58,071
It's whether the parts you're racing with
were developed outside of your facility.

1572
01:41:58,154 --> 01:41:59,489
What? That's insane.

1573
01:41:59,572 --> 01:42:02,242
Based on the paperwork we've
received, there are concerns.

1574
01:42:02,325 --> 01:42:04,786
Hang on, where'd you get these?
These are internal documents.

1575
01:42:04,869 --> 01:42:07,372
This team doesn't break
any rules, sir. No, no.

1576
01:42:07,455 --> 01:42:10,417
-I'll take that with a pinch of salt.
-Someone can fabricate documents.

1577
01:42:10,500 --> 01:42:11,793
Your car's under review.

1578
01:42:11,876 --> 01:42:12,961
-You know the procedure.
-What?

1579
01:42:13,044 --> 01:42:17,424
You cannot race unless you substitute
the previously approved components.

1580
01:42:17,507 --> 01:42:19,634
-No!
-Do you mean our old design?

1581
01:42:19,717 --> 01:42:20,844
A shit box!

1582
01:42:20,927 --> 01:42:22,137
No lo puedo creer.

1583
01:42:22,220 --> 01:42:24,222
Where were you the last
two years? Why now?

1584
01:42:24,305 --> 01:42:26,683
Because we might actually
win a race? Is that it?

1585
01:42:26,766 --> 01:42:29,728
This is not car racing, sir,
this is like corporate espionage!

1586
01:42:29,811 --> 01:42:31,855
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Come... Come here.

1587
01:42:31,938 --> 01:42:33,774
I'm talking to you! Sir!

1588
01:42:33,857 --> 01:42:35,775
Without the upgrade,
we're screwed.

1589
01:43:02,385 --> 01:43:05,722
Sonny, let it go.
Focus on a clean start.

1590
01:43:05,805 --> 01:43:07,682
We'll never win clean.

1591
01:43:08,266 --> 01:43:09,684
Can we just not break any rules?

1592
01:43:09,767 --> 01:43:12,437
Yeah, the rules are always
against us though, aren't they?

1593
01:43:15,940 --> 01:43:18,151
Get them safe through lap one.

1594
01:43:18,234 --> 01:43:21,236
Sonny, we just need to
keep it in one piece. Okay?

1595
01:43:26,618 --> 01:43:27,952
Sonny?

1596
01:43:52,435 --> 01:43:55,063
-Oi, what the hell?
-I don't know!

1597
01:43:55,146 --> 01:43:56,189
What's wrong with Sonny?

1598
01:43:56,272 --> 01:43:58,567
Joshua, yep. Keep focused.
You're still good.

1599
01:43:58,650 --> 01:43:59,776
What's he doing?

1600
01:44:06,282 --> 01:44:07,659
He's driving angry.

1601
01:44:08,326 --> 01:44:09,661
Not good. It's not good.

1602
01:44:16,834 --> 01:44:18,587
Sonny, we need to
make these tires last.

1603
01:44:18,670 --> 01:44:20,171
Take it easy.

1604
01:44:27,053 --> 01:44:29,222
No, he's put the car
in qualifying mode.

1605
01:44:29,305 --> 01:44:31,516
He's gonna run the battery
down. Tell him to put it back.

1606
01:44:31,599 --> 01:44:33,559
Sonny, you're in qualifying
mode. What's going on?

1607
01:44:34,852 --> 01:44:35,853
Sonny, what's happening?

1608
01:44:45,947 --> 01:44:50,285
...blasting along Las Vegas
Boulevard, 210 miles an hour.

1609
01:44:50,368 --> 01:44:52,829
Hard on the brakes now,
and into the chicane.

1610
01:44:52,912 --> 01:44:57,417
Sergio Perez, ahead of Sonny Hayes,
but that's a mega exit from Hayes.

1611
01:44:57,500 --> 01:45:00,629
He's gotta gain on Sergio
Perez, and he's closing.

1612
01:45:00,712 --> 01:45:03,423
Meter by meter. Inch by inch.

1613
01:45:03,506 --> 01:45:08,302
Is this the place to take a gamble?
Hayes attacks round the outside.

1614
01:45:16,477 --> 01:45:17,520
No! No!

1615
01:45:42,920 --> 01:45:45,381
Why do we do this?

1616
01:45:46,007 --> 01:45:48,718
What's wrong with tennis, huh?

1617
01:45:48,801 --> 01:45:50,387
Or golf.

1618
01:45:50,470 --> 01:45:52,221
Right?

1619
01:45:55,558 --> 01:45:56,559
Christ.

1620
01:45:58,519 --> 01:46:00,021
We are totally insane.

1621
01:46:05,026 --> 01:46:07,236
"C5 neck fracture."

1622
01:46:08,571 --> 01:46:10,031
Spinal contusion.

1623
01:46:10,573 --> 01:46:12,575
Compressed thoracic vertebrae.

1624
01:46:13,159 --> 01:46:17,330
Further blunt force impact trauma
likely to result in vision loss,

1625
01:46:17,413 --> 01:46:19,290
"paralysis, death."

1626
01:46:22,543 --> 01:46:24,337
Really lead with the
good news, don't they?

1627
01:46:25,004 --> 01:46:26,798
This is a report
from 30 years ago.

1628
01:46:28,508 --> 01:46:29,884
Why didn't you tell me?

1629
01:46:32,720 --> 01:46:35,181
You never should have
raced again, Sonny.

1630
01:46:36,349 --> 01:46:38,893
How... How do you think I'd
feel if you die on the track?

1631
01:46:41,020 --> 01:46:42,063
Revenge for Monaco.

1632
01:46:42,146 --> 01:46:43,773
It's not a joke!

1633
01:46:46,984 --> 01:46:48,945
It's me who's liable, Sonny.

1634
01:46:49,737 --> 01:46:52,532
And don't think there's some bullshit
loophole to get you out of this.

1635
01:46:52,615 --> 01:46:54,075
-No.
-Ruben, we're drivers.

1636
01:46:54,158 --> 01:46:56,953
We are not drivers, not
anymore. I'm sorry. We're not.

1637
01:46:58,955 --> 01:47:00,248
We're losers.

1638
01:47:01,958 --> 01:47:03,334
We're a pair of dumb,

1639
01:47:03,960 --> 01:47:05,336
sentimental,

1640
01:47:06,796 --> 01:47:08,005
broke losers.

1641
01:47:13,761 --> 01:47:15,179
Okay. You're off the team.

1642
01:47:20,101 --> 01:47:23,855
Your van is in the garage with
all your stuff in it, and...

1643
01:47:30,403 --> 01:47:32,905
I never should have pulled
you into this, Sonny.

1644
01:47:34,198 --> 01:47:35,408
I'm sorry.

1645
01:47:37,994 --> 01:47:39,162
Ruben, wait!

1646
01:47:44,876 --> 01:47:46,002
I need this.

1647
01:47:48,963 --> 01:47:53,342
No one drives forever,
Sonny. Not even you.

1648
01:48:07,899 --> 01:48:13,821
Pippa, load up Monza. Just
like it happened. In the rain.

1649
01:48:15,031 --> 01:48:17,283
Joshua, Sonny says
wait for the straight,

1650
01:48:17,366 --> 01:48:19,410
the straight into turn one.

1651
01:48:27,251 --> 01:48:28,502
Run it again, please.

1652
01:48:33,007 --> 01:48:35,968
...wait for the straight,
the straight into turn one.

1653
01:48:38,596 --> 01:48:40,431
Run it again, please.

1654
01:48:50,149 --> 01:48:52,151
The straight into turn one.

1655
01:48:58,616 --> 01:49:02,578
Whoo!

1656
01:49:19,595 --> 01:49:20,888
Sonny.

1657
01:49:22,139 --> 01:49:23,182
Sonny.

1658
01:49:24,433 --> 01:49:26,269
Hey. You're not in Abu Dhabi?

1659
01:49:26,352 --> 01:49:28,813
I fly out tonight. I, uh...

1660
01:49:28,896 --> 01:49:30,273
Yeah, I wanted to catch you.

1661
01:49:31,816 --> 01:49:33,026
So, listen.

1662
01:49:33,109 --> 01:49:37,071
We both know that the board's wanted
to unload Apex from the start,

1663
01:49:37,738 --> 01:49:40,658
but, yeah, then
you rode into town,

1664
01:49:40,741 --> 01:49:43,328
raised our whole profile,
and now I've, uh...

1665
01:49:43,411 --> 01:49:45,955
Yeah, I've got... I've
got buyers lining up.

1666
01:49:47,873 --> 01:49:49,626
-Uh-huh.
-Gotta be honest with you, man,

1667
01:49:49,709 --> 01:49:52,712
I thought you were gonna be the...
the final nail in the coffin.

1668
01:49:53,296 --> 01:49:54,797
But now I see the play.

1669
01:49:54,880 --> 01:49:58,592
And I want you as
part of the package.

1670
01:50:01,929 --> 01:50:03,472
What sort of package?

1671
01:50:04,140 --> 01:50:06,809
I've set up a sale
where I run the team,

1672
01:50:06,892 --> 01:50:08,561
and keep you on for strategy,

1673
01:50:09,353 --> 01:50:10,688
maybe even team principal.

1674
01:50:12,023 --> 01:50:15,860
With the money from that deal,
I can make you a very rich man.

1675
01:50:16,902 --> 01:50:18,196
Here's the thing.

1676
01:50:18,279 --> 01:50:20,406
With the... the
changing regulations,

1677
01:50:20,489 --> 01:50:23,909
new Mercedes power unit,
Kate's aero, two new drivers...

1678
01:50:25,286 --> 01:50:27,371
we've got a real shot at
the championship next year.

1679
01:50:28,664 --> 01:50:29,791
What about Ruben?

1680
01:50:29,874 --> 01:50:30,958
Don't worry.

1681
01:50:31,709 --> 01:50:32,919
You know.

1682
01:50:33,002 --> 01:50:34,211
We won't embarrass him.

1683
01:50:34,879 --> 01:50:37,757
We'll keep him on with a... with
a title, or brand ambassador...

1684
01:50:38,382 --> 01:50:39,467
You know, something.

1685
01:50:43,554 --> 01:50:44,722
And I get final say?

1686
01:50:44,805 --> 01:50:46,015
Don't change a thing.

1687
01:50:46,098 --> 01:50:47,350
Do what you do, man.

1688
01:50:48,392 --> 01:50:49,769
And that's the irony here.

1689
01:50:49,852 --> 01:50:52,689
You know, the board
originally approved your hire

1690
01:50:52,772 --> 01:50:54,398
because we thought
you'd help us lose.

1691
01:50:55,274 --> 01:50:56,609
-Sorry to make you sweat.
-Hey.

1692
01:50:58,319 --> 01:50:59,362
That's my number.

1693
01:50:59,445 --> 01:51:00,780
Talk to your people.

1694
01:51:01,322 --> 01:51:07,244
But, uh... right after the race, I,
uh... I wanna lock down the deal, okay?

1695
01:51:07,745 --> 01:51:09,705
-So, by Sunday?
-Perfect.

1696
01:51:10,873 --> 01:51:13,751
Listen, this thing can
be your legacy, you know?

1697
01:51:15,878 --> 01:51:17,088
An F1 champion.

1698
01:51:18,339 --> 01:51:19,757
What you always wanted, right?

1699
01:51:23,302 --> 01:51:26,723
It was you who forged
those documents, wasn't it?

1700
01:51:26,806 --> 01:51:27,890
Huh.

1701
01:51:33,229 --> 01:51:36,065
-You're a killer, man, aren't you?
-Hey. I'm a winner.

1702
01:51:37,691 --> 01:51:40,194
Aren't you, huh?

1703
01:51:42,321 --> 01:51:43,322
Okay.

1704
01:51:46,325 --> 01:51:48,661
Oh, hey. How's the back?

1705
01:51:49,662 --> 01:51:50,705
Better.

1706
01:51:50,788 --> 01:51:53,457
I've got an amazing guy.
I'll, uh... I'll hook you up.

1707
01:51:54,750 --> 01:51:55,751
Hail Mary.

1708
01:52:23,362 --> 01:52:24,488
You good?

1709
01:52:29,201 --> 01:52:33,080
Listen, Mum, I've gotta
tell you something.

1710
01:52:36,959 --> 01:52:42,006
In Monza, right before the crash,
it was my decision to make the move.

1711
01:52:43,424 --> 01:52:45,176
Sonny actually told me to wait.

1712
01:52:53,976 --> 01:52:55,103
Family.

1713
01:52:55,186 --> 01:52:57,605
I've been working the
phones with IndyCar,

1714
01:52:57,688 --> 01:52:59,482
and I think I can get
you a test drive, bruv.

1715
01:52:59,565 --> 01:53:00,858
-Hello, Auntie.
-Hi.

1716
01:53:02,109 --> 01:53:04,487
They're trying to pull in a
new demographic, obviously.

1717
01:53:04,570 --> 01:53:07,364
And the ladies love that smile.

1718
01:53:07,948 --> 01:53:10,576
And we can throw in some
incentives, like flights and cars.

1719
01:53:10,659 --> 01:53:12,786
Listen, Cash, you can go.
I don't need you today.

1720
01:53:13,871 --> 01:53:15,289
Nah, mate. You got media next.

1721
01:53:15,372 --> 01:53:18,042
I don't care. They can fine me.

1722
01:53:18,834 --> 01:53:19,835
Besides,

1723
01:53:21,337 --> 01:53:22,963
that's not why I'm
doing it, right?

1724
01:53:23,881 --> 01:53:26,041
Josh, starting tomorrow,
we're not "doing it" anywhere.

1725
01:53:27,676 --> 01:53:29,136
It's all just noise.

1726
01:53:30,054 --> 01:53:32,223
Media, engagement, followers.

1727
01:53:32,932 --> 01:53:36,101
Listen, I've gotta
focus on the race.

1728
01:53:37,937 --> 01:53:39,605
Auntie, please.

1729
01:53:41,232 --> 01:53:42,566
Well, you heard the man.

1730
01:53:51,617 --> 01:53:54,161
-Deal.
-Deal.

1731
01:53:57,122 --> 01:53:59,083
-Yo.
-Hey.

1732
01:53:59,166 --> 01:54:00,751
-Hi.
-Hey.

1733
01:54:03,712 --> 01:54:05,673
Guys, what's happening?

1734
01:54:05,756 --> 01:54:08,926
Parc fermé. Waiting for
FIA to cut the seals.

1735
01:54:09,009 --> 01:54:11,136
Oh, good.

1736
01:54:11,720 --> 01:54:14,181
-We got time then.
-For what?

1737
01:54:15,140 --> 01:54:16,350
For...

1738
01:54:19,436 --> 01:54:21,689
No, no, no.

1739
01:54:26,277 --> 01:54:29,489
Welcome to the Paddock Club,
for our most valued guests.

1740
01:54:29,572 --> 01:54:33,493
Please, uh, grab a drink,
make yourselves at home,

1741
01:54:33,576 --> 01:54:37,955
and, uh, enjoy the very best view
there is of, uh... of Formula 1.

1742
01:54:39,999 --> 01:54:41,500
Okay? Okay.

1743
01:54:59,268 --> 01:55:01,437
Hey, guys, don't
stop! Keep going!

1744
01:55:37,139 --> 01:55:40,059
No way.

1745
01:55:47,524 --> 01:55:50,444
Jesús, it's like a
morgue around here.

1746
01:55:52,780 --> 01:55:54,198
How'd you get here?

1747
01:55:54,281 --> 01:55:55,741
Premium economy.

1748
01:55:59,995 --> 01:56:01,789
What? What is this?

1749
01:56:01,872 --> 01:56:03,457
Well, that's my
bullshit loophole.

1750
01:56:03,540 --> 01:56:05,668
Oh, no, forget it. I'm not
even going to read that.

1751
01:56:05,751 --> 01:56:08,296
That is a real legal document
from a real Tijuana lawyer...

1752
01:56:08,379 --> 01:56:10,131
...waiving all liability to you

1753
01:56:10,214 --> 01:56:12,841
and your company vis-à-vis
this race, myself, and me.

1754
01:56:13,926 --> 01:56:15,177
And...

1755
01:56:17,763 --> 01:56:21,183
...since you owe me my last paycheck,
technically I'm still on this team.

1756
01:56:26,438 --> 01:56:27,940
Kate, where's the shitbox?

1757
01:56:28,607 --> 01:56:30,943
The FIA confirmed that
the documents were forged,

1758
01:56:31,026 --> 01:56:33,153
and they were sent
by someone from Apex.

1759
01:56:33,987 --> 01:56:35,072
Huh.

1760
01:56:35,698 --> 01:56:38,576
Okay, I don't care about
your loophole. I don't.

1761
01:56:38,659 --> 01:56:40,703
That is my car. You
are not racing it.

1762
01:56:40,786 --> 01:56:41,912
-Ruben.
-No, Sonny.

1763
01:56:41,995 --> 01:56:43,372
Listen,

1764
01:56:44,623 --> 01:56:46,334
I can't let you do that.

1765
01:56:46,417 --> 01:56:47,418
I can't.

1766
01:56:47,501 --> 01:56:48,710
Okay?

1767
01:56:50,462 --> 01:56:54,091
If the last thing I do is drive that
car, I will take that life, man.

1768
01:56:57,970 --> 01:56:59,388
A thousand times.

1769
01:57:04,143 --> 01:57:05,394
We can't win.

1770
01:57:07,229 --> 01:57:08,647
We can't if we don't try.

1771
01:57:54,943 --> 01:57:56,362
How come you never
look at the card?

1772
01:57:56,445 --> 01:57:57,695
What card?

1773
01:58:38,904 --> 01:58:41,240
Welcome to the very
final spots on the grid.

1774
01:58:41,323 --> 01:58:45,703
And as ever, we'll go from last to
first. And breaking news here in P22,

1775
01:58:45,786 --> 01:58:47,371
because we're hearing the
Apex GP team have made...

1776
01:58:47,454 --> 01:58:49,248
-Hey, Peter.
-Yeah?

1777
01:58:49,832 --> 01:58:51,000
That's your guy. Isn't it?

1778
01:58:51,083 --> 01:58:55,087
...being replaced by Sonny Hayes, who
didn't even make the trip to Abu Dhabi...

1779
01:58:55,170 --> 01:58:57,715
Uh, will you excuse me for
one second? I'm really sorry.

1780
01:58:57,798 --> 01:59:00,676
Now, the rules require that he has
to start at the back of the pack.

1781
01:59:01,343 --> 01:59:03,637
Excuse me. What the hell?

1782
01:59:04,388 --> 01:59:05,597
What?

1783
01:59:09,768 --> 01:59:10,853
You still got my phone?

1784
01:59:29,830 --> 01:59:31,290
-Good luck today.
-You too, James.

1785
01:59:31,373 --> 01:59:32,500
Excuse me. Hey, Sonny. Sonny!

1786
01:59:32,583 --> 01:59:34,126
Hey, look, I know we've
had our differences,

1787
01:59:34,209 --> 01:59:36,420
-but look, this is your last F1 race.
-Chaz! This guy.

1788
01:59:36,503 --> 01:59:37,880
Any thought...

1789
01:59:40,048 --> 01:59:41,049
What's that?

1790
01:59:45,178 --> 01:59:46,471
Bloody hell.

1791
01:59:48,390 --> 01:59:49,641
Bloody hell!

1792
02:00:10,329 --> 02:00:11,330
Elbows out?

1793
02:00:11,997 --> 02:00:12,998
Elbows out.

1794
02:00:14,791 --> 02:00:20,256
All set for our season finale here
in Abu Dhabi where it's lights out.

1795
02:00:20,339 --> 02:00:23,884
And away we go. Good start
there for Joshua Pearce.

1796
02:00:23,967 --> 02:00:26,136
Drivers jockeying for position

1797
02:00:26,219 --> 02:00:30,850
as we head full-throttle down the
main straight and into turn one.

1798
02:00:30,933 --> 02:00:35,771
Tricky first corner, and going wide,
the Aston Martin and the AlphaTauri

1799
02:00:35,854 --> 02:00:38,023
as Pearce picks up two places.

1800
02:00:38,106 --> 02:00:40,484
Yes, Pearce showing some
real maturity there.

1801
02:00:40,567 --> 02:00:44,738
He saw a bad situation before it
happened and he's off to a great start.

1802
02:01:03,298 --> 02:01:04,675
Don't even think about it.

1803
02:01:20,649 --> 02:01:23,568
Here comes the Alpine
down the inside. Contact!

1804
02:01:24,820 --> 02:01:27,948
And three days out of
hospital, Hayes will feel that.

1805
02:01:37,791 --> 02:01:39,752
Gained places,
guys. We're alive.

1806
02:01:39,835 --> 02:01:41,420
I hope he hasn't
damaged the car,

1807
02:01:41,503 --> 02:01:44,381
but despite everything, it's
still a great first lap.

1808
02:01:44,464 --> 02:01:46,467
It is! Hayes in P16.

1809
02:01:46,550 --> 02:01:49,177
Pearce, his teammate, up to P9.

1810
02:01:51,138 --> 02:01:54,391
Red Bull, Mercedes and Ferrari
holding on to the lead.

1811
02:01:54,474 --> 02:01:56,185
Apex in the midfield.

1812
02:01:56,268 --> 02:01:59,188
Let's see if they can do
anything to shake up this race.

1813
02:01:59,271 --> 02:02:00,356
Gap to leader?

1814
02:02:00,439 --> 02:02:01,565
Fifteen seconds.

1815
02:02:02,774 --> 02:02:05,318
Keep JP plus 20
seconds. Plus 20.

1816
02:02:05,902 --> 02:02:07,738
-Length of a pit stop.
-You know why.

1817
02:02:09,239 --> 02:02:11,033
It's a busy race
for Sonny Hayes,

1818
02:02:11,116 --> 02:02:14,203
and now here comes Kevin
Magnussen looking to make a move.

1819
02:02:14,286 --> 02:02:15,996
And this could spell trouble.

1820
02:02:16,079 --> 02:02:17,706
There's history
between these two.

1821
02:02:17,789 --> 02:02:21,126
Often, the irresistible force
meets the immovable object.

1822
02:02:21,209 --> 02:02:23,128
And Magnussen, looking
down the inside,

1823
02:02:23,211 --> 02:02:26,757
-locks up and hits Hayes.
-Box, box. Box, box, box.

1824
02:02:26,840 --> 02:02:28,300
Copy, coming in for hards.

1825
02:02:29,885 --> 02:02:31,136
Damn.

1826
02:02:32,637 --> 02:02:35,849
Slow is smooth. Smooth is
fast. Here we go, boys.

1827
02:02:43,148 --> 02:02:44,274
Hayes exit the pits.

1828
02:02:44,357 --> 02:02:47,152
He had to come in because
of that damage to his tire.

1829
02:02:47,235 --> 02:02:51,364
But what of Joshua Pearce?
Where do Apex GP go with him?

1830
02:02:53,075 --> 02:02:54,910
Guys, am I boxing?
What's the plan?

1831
02:02:54,993 --> 02:02:57,413
Plan C, Plan C.
Stay out. Stay out.

1832
02:02:57,496 --> 02:03:00,165
-Chaos.
-Copy that.

1833
02:03:00,248 --> 02:03:03,794
Joshua slows down the leaders for
Sonny. Sonny does the same for him.

1834
02:03:05,253 --> 02:03:06,714
Pearce stays out.

1835
02:03:06,797 --> 02:03:09,800
It's a strategy that Apex
have used before this season.

1836
02:03:09,883 --> 02:03:13,970
It helps them with track position for now,
but they gotta keep these tires alive.

1837
02:03:17,516 --> 02:03:19,184
It's the only way
we keep this close.

1838
02:03:19,768 --> 02:03:20,728
And then we need luck.

1839
02:03:20,811 --> 02:03:22,187
I'm way ahead of ya.

1840
02:03:25,482 --> 02:03:28,986
Lap 25, and every driver
so far has pitted, bar one.

1841
02:03:29,069 --> 02:03:30,821
And he leads the race.

1842
02:03:30,904 --> 02:03:33,824
Joshua Pearce controlling
the pace out in front.

1843
02:03:33,907 --> 02:03:35,617
And that gives his
teammate, Hayes,

1844
02:03:35,700 --> 02:03:38,078
a chance to maintain his
position in the midfield

1845
02:03:38,161 --> 02:03:41,373
despite the contact,
puncture and pit stop.

1846
02:03:41,456 --> 02:03:43,166
They're working
really well together.

1847
02:03:44,960 --> 02:03:46,045
How's JP doing up there?

1848
02:03:46,128 --> 02:03:49,339
He's keeping the leaders at bay.
DRS active next straight, Sonny.

1849
02:03:49,422 --> 02:03:50,799
Got it.

1850
02:03:51,633 --> 02:03:55,095
Onto the back straight. He's
enjoying this new upgrade,

1851
02:03:55,178 --> 02:03:58,348
and he's got DRS, and
he's got Pierre Gasly.

1852
02:03:58,431 --> 02:04:00,600
Sonny Hayes up into P15.

1853
02:04:01,726 --> 02:04:04,104
Sonny, you have got
the pace. Keep pushing.

1854
02:04:04,688 --> 02:04:06,565
Pearce has been doing
a great job out front

1855
02:04:06,648 --> 02:04:10,235
despite the used tires, but
that moment is nearly over now.

1856
02:04:10,318 --> 02:04:13,155
Verstappen up the
inside and he's through.

1857
02:04:13,238 --> 02:04:15,741
Fabulous first stint
from Joshua Pearce.

1858
02:04:15,824 --> 02:04:18,285
Max has passed, and his
troubles don't end there.

1859
02:04:19,619 --> 02:04:21,413
Here comes Charles Leclerc.

1860
02:04:21,496 --> 02:04:25,751
It's another overtake. Pearce
lost the lead and drops now to P3.

1861
02:04:25,834 --> 02:04:28,295
Sorry, guys. My
rear tires are shot.

1862
02:04:28,378 --> 02:04:30,255
Copy that. Box, JP. Box, box.

1863
02:04:31,840 --> 02:04:33,926
Pearce stretching those
tires to the limit.

1864
02:04:34,009 --> 02:04:37,012
Short-term pain
for long-term gain.

1865
02:04:45,228 --> 02:04:48,107
And he exits the pit.
He'll have fresher tires.

1866
02:04:48,190 --> 02:04:51,401
He can now attack in the
second half of the race.

1867
02:04:51,985 --> 02:04:53,737
Sonny, the three leaders
are still on hards.

1868
02:04:53,820 --> 02:04:55,739
They're gonna have to stop
again. This is their pit window.

1869
02:04:55,822 --> 02:04:58,909
One of the leaders is gonna undercut.
I need to be there when they do.

1870
02:05:00,327 --> 02:05:02,621
P3 Ferrari. Pippa,
can he beat it to one?

1871
02:05:05,165 --> 02:05:06,166
Depends on their stop.

1872
02:05:06,249 --> 02:05:08,001
Will the undercut
work for Ferrari?

1873
02:05:08,084 --> 02:05:10,462
Five point eight. He needs
to pick up half a second.

1874
02:05:12,672 --> 02:05:14,967
Sonny, you need half a
second. Go, go, go, go, go.

1875
02:05:15,050 --> 02:05:16,468
And Sonny Hayes
is on the charge.

1876
02:05:16,551 --> 02:05:18,971
Under the track
goes the Ferrari.

1877
02:05:19,054 --> 02:05:20,973
Through the first
corner goes Sonny Hayes.

1878
02:05:21,056 --> 02:05:23,725
It's neck and neck.
It's really tight.

1879
02:05:23,808 --> 02:05:27,312
Sonny Hayes is just
ahead of Carlos Sainz.

1880
02:05:27,395 --> 02:05:29,648
-Yes! Come on!
-It's worked so far for Apex GP.

1881
02:05:29,731 --> 02:05:31,525
But their trouble's not over.

1882
02:05:31,608 --> 02:05:35,821
Down the inside, there's a chance
for Carlos Sainz, and he takes it.

1883
02:05:35,904 --> 02:05:37,114
But he locks up.

1884
02:05:37,197 --> 02:05:39,908
The Ferrari goes wide
and Sonny Hayes says,

1885
02:05:39,991 --> 02:05:42,744
"Thank you very much indeed."

1886
02:05:44,371 --> 02:05:46,373
How are they staying
so close to the lead?

1887
02:05:46,456 --> 02:05:49,709
Uh, they're, um...
They're working together.

1888
02:05:50,377 --> 02:05:53,880
Two Apex cars in the top 10,
but still a long way to go.

1889
02:05:55,548 --> 02:05:59,303
Twenty laps remaining, and Apex
has worked their way up the order.

1890
02:05:59,386 --> 02:06:01,680
We're now at the
final pit stop window.

1891
02:06:01,763 --> 02:06:04,349
This is our chance for P1.
Make sure JP beats them out.

1892
02:06:04,432 --> 02:06:09,187
Hamilton and Leclerc come into
the pits, but Pearce stays out.

1893
02:06:10,230 --> 02:06:12,900
-Talk to me. Can I catch 'em?
-Yep. They're just coming out.

1894
02:06:12,983 --> 02:06:14,776
Push now. Push now. Push, push.

1895
02:06:14,859 --> 02:06:16,236
Copy. Pushing.

1896
02:06:16,820 --> 02:06:18,322
Oh, this is gonna be close.

1897
02:06:18,405 --> 02:06:21,366
Joshua Pearce inching
ahead. Staying ahead.

1898
02:06:21,449 --> 02:06:24,244
For the second time in
this race, he leads.

1899
02:06:24,327 --> 02:06:25,329
Let's go!

1900
02:06:25,412 --> 02:06:26,914
Yes.

1901
02:06:26,997 --> 02:06:30,000
You are P1, Joshua.

1902
02:06:30,083 --> 02:06:32,461
But Pearce will have a
hard time holding them off

1903
02:06:32,544 --> 02:06:35,547
with Hamilton and
Leclerc on fresh tires.

1904
02:06:44,764 --> 02:06:47,059
Four laps to go.
Sonny Hayes is in P4.

1905
02:06:47,142 --> 02:06:49,061
He's five seconds
behind his teammate,

1906
02:06:49,144 --> 02:06:50,854
but both are on old tires.

1907
02:06:50,937 --> 02:06:53,648
There's little chance
they'll gain any places now.

1908
02:06:55,900 --> 02:06:59,780
And here's Hamilton attacking
Pearce into turn five.

1909
02:06:59,863 --> 02:07:01,114
And he's through.

1910
02:07:01,197 --> 02:07:05,118
Nobody has to stop again and
our tires are nine laps older.

1911
02:07:06,870 --> 02:07:09,331
And Leclerc attacks and passes.

1912
02:07:09,414 --> 02:07:13,918
Pearce's tires are absolutely finished.
There was nothing he could do about that.

1913
02:07:14,669 --> 02:07:17,673
I'm sorry, guys. I've
got nothing left.

1914
02:07:17,756 --> 02:07:21,218
It's been the Apex GP
story all year long.

1915
02:07:21,301 --> 02:07:22,302
Plenty of risks.

1916
02:07:22,385 --> 02:07:24,012
A great underdog story,

1917
02:07:24,095 --> 02:07:26,098
but we know, Martin, only
talent crowns a champion.

1918
02:07:26,181 --> 02:07:27,683
Losing grip. Tires are gone.

1919
02:07:27,766 --> 02:07:30,394
Yeah. Sadly, the deck's
been stacked against them

1920
02:07:30,477 --> 02:07:32,354
and now they're out
of cards to play.

1921
02:07:32,437 --> 02:07:33,522
It ain't over, right?

1922
02:07:33,605 --> 02:07:36,983
No, but nothing can change. It's
the worst feeling in the world.

1923
02:07:41,613 --> 02:07:43,323
George Russell on the attack.

1924
02:07:43,406 --> 02:07:46,243
Hayes looking to defend, through
the left-hander they go...

1925
02:07:46,326 --> 02:07:47,744
And there's contact!

1926
02:07:47,827 --> 02:07:50,580
Hayes is spun round
and into the barrier.

1927
02:07:50,663 --> 02:07:52,456
That's a big one.

1928
02:07:54,167 --> 02:07:56,503
-Fucking yes, yes, yes.
-Oh, no.

1929
02:07:57,712 --> 02:07:58,630
Yeah, no. Ooh.

1930
02:07:58,713 --> 02:08:00,382
There's debris all
over the race track

1931
02:08:00,465 --> 02:08:02,884
and substantial damage
to the barriers.

1932
02:08:02,967 --> 02:08:06,138
The stewards have no choice
but to red flag this race.

1933
02:08:06,221 --> 02:08:07,222
Miracle.

1934
02:08:07,305 --> 02:08:09,057
And speaking of damage, Martin,

1935
02:08:09,140 --> 02:08:11,685
Hayes will only be allowed
to continue in this race

1936
02:08:11,768 --> 02:08:14,980
if he can get his car all
the way around the circuit

1937
02:08:15,063 --> 02:08:16,523
and back to the pit lane.

1938
02:08:17,107 --> 02:08:19,276
Sonny. Sonny, can
you get it back?

1939
02:08:19,359 --> 02:08:22,153
I'll get it back. I'll get it
back if I have to push it back.

1940
02:08:22,737 --> 02:08:27,157
Come on, Sonny. Nice and easy.

1941
02:08:29,744 --> 02:08:32,456
He's still going.
He's still going.

1942
02:08:32,539 --> 02:08:33,957
JP, red flag.

1943
02:08:34,040 --> 02:08:35,250
Red flag. Come in.

1944
02:08:35,333 --> 02:08:39,671
We are still alive, hermano.

1945
02:08:39,754 --> 02:08:41,381
Red flag!

1946
02:08:41,464 --> 02:08:45,093
And somehow Sonny Hayes has got
his car back to the pit lane.

1947
02:08:45,176 --> 02:08:47,346
-It's a miracle.
-I know! I know.

1948
02:08:47,429 --> 02:08:48,722
Never seen one until now.

1949
02:08:48,805 --> 02:08:52,308
Home free. Good girl. Let's go.

1950
02:08:53,017 --> 02:08:53,935
New softs, both cars.

1951
02:08:54,018 --> 02:08:56,480
Raise the tire pressure
for three quick laps.

1952
02:08:56,563 --> 02:08:58,648
Team, time to build a car.

1953
02:08:58,731 --> 02:09:00,108
Red flag rules then.

1954
02:09:00,191 --> 02:09:03,487
The teams can make changes. They
can make repairs to their cars.

1955
02:09:03,570 --> 02:09:04,946
But only in that pit lane.

1956
02:09:05,029 --> 02:09:10,034
And with only ten minutes to make
repairs, Apex GP has their work cut out.

1957
02:09:10,535 --> 02:09:13,830
And all cars can fit
a fresh set of tires

1958
02:09:13,913 --> 02:09:15,874
for what will be a
three-lap sprint.

1959
02:09:15,957 --> 02:09:18,960
-Dodge! Dodge, are we gonna make it?
-I don't know. I don't know.

1960
02:09:24,799 --> 02:09:27,302
That was clean. That
wasn't me. Not this time.

1961
02:09:27,385 --> 02:09:31,098
"Not this time"? Tell
that to the stewards.

1962
02:09:31,181 --> 02:09:32,515
Check the replay.

1963
02:09:33,558 --> 02:09:35,477
I got this. Lift that corner.

1964
02:09:43,860 --> 02:09:46,530
I'm good. I'm good,
I'm good. I'm good.

1965
02:09:46,613 --> 02:09:48,156
What the stewards
will be looking at

1966
02:09:48,239 --> 02:09:50,075
is whether Hayes
went off completely

1967
02:09:50,158 --> 02:09:54,121
or kept at least one tire on track
during the contact with Russell.

1968
02:09:54,204 --> 02:09:55,914
-Yo, you good?
-Yeah, good.

1969
02:09:55,997 --> 02:09:57,207
Listen, you were on track.

1970
02:09:57,290 --> 02:10:00,335
Yeah, it was your corner.
P3 and P4. Let's go!

1971
02:10:00,418 --> 02:10:04,381
Given Hayes's reputation, they'll be
looking at this really, really closely.

1972
02:10:04,464 --> 02:10:06,133
I'm not expecting
a quick decision.

1973
02:10:06,216 --> 02:10:07,717
Come on, that's
clearly a penalty.

1974
02:10:07,800 --> 02:10:09,719
Like... I mean, not that
that's what we want,

1975
02:10:09,802 --> 02:10:13,432
but, like, objectively,
that's the guy.

1976
02:10:13,515 --> 02:10:16,184
-Oh, man. It can't end this way.
-It's just a time-out.

1977
02:10:16,267 --> 02:10:20,272
Like the last 30 years. It's in
the hands of the racing gods now.

1978
02:10:20,355 --> 02:10:22,273
We gotta believe. Gotta believe.

1979
02:10:23,775 --> 02:10:25,777
Plenty going on here in the pit.

1980
02:10:25,860 --> 02:10:29,030
Oh, look. Here comes the new
wing. This is a massive job.

1981
02:10:29,113 --> 02:10:33,159
Yeah, but will the car hold together
for the remaining three laps?

1982
02:10:36,371 --> 02:10:38,248
Well, that barrier
looks okay now.

1983
02:10:38,331 --> 02:10:41,710
The marshals just sweeping the last
few bits of debris off the track,

1984
02:10:41,793 --> 02:10:43,879
and the clock
continues to tick down.

1985
02:10:43,962 --> 02:10:47,966
Yeah, it's just over two minutes
until this race gets underway again.

1986
02:11:08,945 --> 02:11:10,405
JP, JP!

1987
02:11:11,698 --> 02:11:12,741
Three laps.

1988
02:11:12,824 --> 02:11:14,242
Three laps is a lifetime.

1989
02:11:14,325 --> 02:11:15,743
Go win this thing.

1990
02:11:27,672 --> 02:11:30,258
Hey, Sonny. Sonny,
you got a minute?

1991
02:11:32,468 --> 02:11:33,511
We got you a car.

1992
02:11:34,178 --> 02:11:36,931
Ah, you rock. Thank you.

1993
02:11:39,517 --> 02:11:42,729
Because Apex GP didn't make
the top 10 in qualifying,

1994
02:11:42,812 --> 02:11:45,607
they have a new set of
soft tires available,

1995
02:11:45,690 --> 02:11:48,985
which will give them extra speed
over the cars ahead of them

1996
02:11:49,068 --> 02:11:51,321
on the used soft tires.

1997
02:11:51,404 --> 02:11:54,282
This red flag is a lifeline.

1998
02:11:54,365 --> 02:11:56,784
You'd almost wonder if
Sonny didn't engineer it.

1999
02:11:57,619 --> 02:12:00,330
But wait, we're the
only cars on fresh tires

2000
02:12:00,413 --> 02:12:02,165
because we sucked in
qualifying yesterday?

2001
02:12:02,248 --> 02:12:03,917
Never got the
chance to use them.

2002
02:12:04,000 --> 02:12:06,253
Sometimes when
you lose, you win.

2003
02:12:06,336 --> 02:12:08,921
-That don't make no sense.
-It's a Sonny thing.

2004
02:12:09,797 --> 02:12:11,716
Light at the end of
the pit lane is green.

2005
02:12:11,799 --> 02:12:14,970
We're off on our second
formation lap of the evening,

2006
02:12:15,053 --> 02:12:18,640
and when this race resumes,
this is gonna be an epic sprint.

2007
02:12:18,723 --> 02:12:21,809
Hamilton, Leclerc, Pearce,
Hayes. That's the top four.

2008
02:12:46,042 --> 02:12:47,919
Sonny, we just heard
from the stewards.

2009
02:12:48,002 --> 02:12:49,004
Goddamn it. Now?

2010
02:12:49,087 --> 02:12:50,714
We're debating
whether to tell you.

2011
02:12:50,797 --> 02:12:52,966
Kaspar says, "Yes,"
but Kate says, "Don't."

2012
02:12:53,049 --> 02:12:55,176
She says you're fast
when you're angry.

2013
02:12:55,259 --> 02:12:57,262
Tell her, "Job well done."

2014
02:12:57,345 --> 02:13:00,390
And here's news. Stewards
have made their decision.

2015
02:13:00,473 --> 02:13:05,812
That Lap 55 collision between Hayes
and Russell is ruled a racing incident.

2016
02:13:05,895 --> 02:13:08,064
No further investigation.

2017
02:13:08,147 --> 02:13:10,274
Whoa! Sonny.

2018
02:13:13,152 --> 02:13:16,531
That was your line, Sonny.
Go finish your race.

2019
02:13:19,701 --> 02:13:22,329
Joshua, we still got
two cars in the mix.

2020
02:13:22,412 --> 02:13:23,871
Then we've got a team.

2021
02:13:25,039 --> 02:13:26,458
Once those red lights go out,

2022
02:13:26,541 --> 02:13:29,544
this will be an absolute
sprint to the finish.

2023
02:13:30,420 --> 02:13:32,839
Position advantage to
Mercedes and Ferrari.

2024
02:13:32,922 --> 02:13:35,383
Tire advantage to Apex GP.

2025
02:14:01,909 --> 02:14:03,453
Tell JP to follow my lead.

2026
02:14:03,536 --> 02:14:05,330
Joshua, Sonny says
to follow him.

2027
02:14:05,413 --> 02:14:07,081
Follow? He's behind me.

2028
02:14:09,333 --> 02:14:11,961
-Cheeky bastard.
-That's it. Stay with me.

2029
02:14:21,012 --> 02:14:22,430
He's giving you a tow. Take it.

2030
02:14:22,513 --> 02:14:23,723
All the way.

2031
02:14:51,209 --> 02:14:53,169
Come on, kid. Get it. Come on!

2032
02:14:53,252 --> 02:14:55,130
Hayes plays the decoy,

2033
02:14:55,213 --> 02:14:59,592
and Pearce rockets past
Leclerc and up into second.

2034
02:14:59,675 --> 02:15:05,140
And Leclerc's in danger from Sonny Hayes.
Round the outside, he's up into P3.

2035
02:15:05,223 --> 02:15:06,599
Perfect teamwork.

2036
02:15:06,682 --> 02:15:10,478
Hayes and Pearce working
together, it's like racing ballet.

2037
02:15:11,062 --> 02:15:12,605
It's a beautiful sight,

2038
02:15:12,688 --> 02:15:16,734
but now their sights are set on
the race leader, Lewis Hamilton.

2039
02:15:17,235 --> 02:15:18,694
Yeah! Remember me?

2040
02:15:28,287 --> 02:15:30,039
Come on, boys. Send it!

2041
02:15:57,233 --> 02:15:58,359
Why didn't they overtake?

2042
02:15:58,442 --> 02:16:00,028
Lewis will defend whichever
car attacks first.

2043
02:16:00,111 --> 02:16:03,531
-But they both can't wait.
-Someone has to sacrifice.

2044
02:16:08,828 --> 02:16:09,746
Two onto one,

2045
02:16:09,829 --> 02:16:12,415
and all the pressure
is on Lewis Hamilton

2046
02:16:12,498 --> 02:16:15,418
as Apex work as a pack.

2047
02:16:16,419 --> 02:16:17,378
Go win it, kid.

2048
02:16:17,461 --> 02:16:19,214
Hayes makes the first move.

2049
02:16:19,297 --> 02:16:22,217
-Hamilton defends. Pearce attacks.
-Yeah!

2050
02:16:22,300 --> 02:16:24,803
And Pearce has P1.

2051
02:16:24,886 --> 02:16:26,262
-Yes!
-Yes, yes!

2052
02:16:28,139 --> 02:16:30,183
Toe-to-toe, wheel-to-wheel,

2053
02:16:30,266 --> 02:16:33,853
this is epic racing to
finish off the season.

2054
02:16:33,936 --> 02:16:36,606
And Sonny Hayes and Lewis
Hamilton aren't done yet.

2055
02:16:36,689 --> 02:16:38,650
Hamilton, on Sonny Hayes.

2056
02:16:38,733 --> 02:16:40,109
There's contact!

2057
02:16:40,192 --> 02:16:42,153
And through goes Hamilton.

2058
02:16:45,031 --> 02:16:47,200
-Yes, yes!
-Come on!

2059
02:16:47,283 --> 02:16:48,283
Yes!

2060
02:16:49,035 --> 02:16:51,412
Guys, talk to me. Where's
Sonny? Can he finish?

2061
02:16:51,495 --> 02:16:53,998
One more lap, JP.
Hamilton never backs down.

2062
02:16:54,081 --> 02:16:55,959
Can Sonny finish the race, man?

2063
02:16:56,042 --> 02:16:58,336
Yes, he's on track. Just
watch Lewis when he fights.

2064
02:16:58,419 --> 02:17:01,130
You're P1. No more risks.

2065
02:17:01,213 --> 02:17:02,381
No such thing.

2066
02:17:03,674 --> 02:17:07,303
The rookie holds his
line. He won't back down.

2067
02:17:07,386 --> 02:17:11,057
He's here to fight the
seven-time world champion.

2068
02:17:14,810 --> 02:17:15,937
That made contact.

2069
02:17:16,020 --> 02:17:20,191
The leader and Lewis Hamilton
are out of this race.

2070
02:17:20,274 --> 02:17:24,320
Despite yellow flags flying at
turn one, this race will continue.

2071
02:17:24,403 --> 02:17:26,864
Sonny, push, push, push.
You're P1! You're P1!

2072
02:17:27,406 --> 02:17:29,826
Apex GP has only one lap to go.

2073
02:17:29,909 --> 02:17:33,079
The question is do
they have the car?

2074
02:17:33,663 --> 02:17:34,997
We have the driver.

2075
02:17:38,834 --> 02:17:41,087
Yeah! Go on, Sonny!

2076
02:18:26,257 --> 02:18:27,257
What's happening?

2077
02:18:27,925 --> 02:18:29,260
He's flying.

2078
02:18:54,410 --> 02:18:56,327
Sonny, you did it!
We won! We won!

2079
02:18:57,413 --> 02:18:59,081
Yeah!

2080
02:19:03,878 --> 02:19:05,588
Yes!

2081
02:19:10,342 --> 02:19:11,342
Yeah!

2082
02:19:15,931 --> 02:19:16,975
We won!

2083
02:19:17,058 --> 02:19:20,019
Yeah!

2084
02:19:22,938 --> 02:19:23,981
Yeah!

2085
02:19:25,524 --> 02:19:26,817
We won!

2086
02:19:28,694 --> 02:19:32,698
-We did it! Whoo!
-Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

2087
02:19:34,033 --> 02:19:36,744
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

2088
02:19:41,082 --> 02:19:43,542
-Come on! Yes!
-Yes!

2089
02:19:54,845 --> 02:19:57,181
Means another three
years for Ruben, right?

2090
02:19:58,891 --> 02:19:59,892
Yeah.

2091
02:20:00,684 --> 02:20:02,561
I guess we'll check
back about that deal.

2092
02:20:05,523 --> 02:20:07,399
Presuming you're
still on the board.

2093
02:20:16,700 --> 02:20:20,413
Breathtaking!
Breathless! Incredible!

2094
02:20:20,496 --> 02:20:23,291
What an Abu Dhabi Grand
Prix this has been!

2095
02:20:23,374 --> 02:20:25,376
What a victory as well!

2096
02:20:25,459 --> 02:20:29,797
Absolutely. It's a race for
the ages. An absolute thriller.

2097
02:20:29,880 --> 02:20:33,384
-And this man wins his first Grand Prix.
-Well done.

2098
02:20:33,467 --> 02:20:35,178
-It's been 30 years in the making.
-Well done!

2099
02:20:35,261 --> 02:20:38,556
And the team did a brilliant
job from the pit wall.

2100
02:20:38,639 --> 02:20:42,060
-And of course we can't forget Pearce...
-Oi! What you smiling about?

2101
02:20:42,143 --> 02:20:44,520
-...playing his part in this victory.
-You.

2102
02:20:44,603 --> 02:20:47,063
I'm gonna win a million races.
You should at least have one.

2103
02:20:49,567 --> 02:20:50,985
We did it.

2104
02:20:51,610 --> 02:20:52,987
Yeah, we did.

2105
02:20:57,908 --> 02:20:58,993
Whoo!

2106
02:21:06,792 --> 02:21:07,794
Sonny!

2107
02:21:07,877 --> 02:21:09,378
No, no, no, no. Give it to him.

2108
02:21:10,254 --> 02:21:11,755
No, no, no. Give it to him.

2109
02:21:14,466 --> 02:21:16,802
Oh, my God. Thank
you. Thank you.

2110
02:21:29,440 --> 02:21:31,275
Let's go!

2111
02:21:33,360 --> 02:21:35,070
I love you.

2112
02:21:43,037 --> 02:21:44,831
Yeah!

2113
02:21:44,914 --> 02:21:46,999
Today we get to say...

2114
02:21:47,082 --> 02:21:49,722
-"We are the best in the world!"
-"We are the best in the world!"

2115
02:23:00,030 --> 02:23:01,032
Joshua.

2116
02:23:01,115 --> 02:23:03,576
If you were ever to consider
to drive somewhere else,

2117
02:23:03,659 --> 02:23:04,660
you know where to find me.

2118
02:23:04,743 --> 02:23:08,455
Thanks, Toto, but
I'm happy where I am.

2119
02:23:09,164 --> 02:23:10,416
Congratulations.

2120
02:23:12,876 --> 02:23:14,879
Yeah, baby! Let them wait!

2121
02:23:14,962 --> 02:23:16,838
Let them wait!

2122
02:23:20,509 --> 02:23:21,594
The cup!

2123
02:23:21,677 --> 02:23:24,554
Kate, you built a hell of a car.

2124
02:24:28,202 --> 02:24:30,037
Another race I don't know about?

2125
02:24:31,789 --> 02:24:32,790
Somewhere.

2126
02:24:34,458 --> 02:24:36,126
That beats this?

2127
02:24:39,797 --> 02:24:40,798
Yeah.

2128
02:24:44,301 --> 02:24:47,138
I wanted to say, "See
you down the road,"

2129
02:24:47,221 --> 02:24:49,807
but in a way that
was more poetic.

2130
02:24:52,643 --> 02:24:53,644
So...

2131
02:24:56,021 --> 02:24:57,564
Can I see you down the road?

2132
02:25:03,195 --> 02:25:04,196
Yes.

2133
02:25:20,254 --> 02:25:22,005
Hang on to that until then.

2134
02:25:24,174 --> 02:25:26,009
Okay.

2135
02:25:29,388 --> 02:25:30,763
And drive fast.

2136
02:25:40,774 --> 02:25:42,443
And where do you
think you're going?

2137
02:25:43,193 --> 02:25:45,780
Don't worry about
me. Go celebrate.

2138
02:25:45,863 --> 02:25:47,448
But you're off to where?

2139
02:25:47,948 --> 02:25:50,576
You know, couple
more dragons to slay.

2140
02:25:51,076 --> 02:25:52,494
It's your team now.

2141
02:25:55,289 --> 02:25:56,706
It was always my team.

2142
02:26:00,002 --> 02:26:01,253
I'll be watching.

2143
02:26:02,629 --> 02:26:04,089
See you around, swan.

2144
02:27:19,790 --> 02:27:20,791
Hello!

2145
02:27:22,084 --> 02:27:23,126
Buenas.

2146
02:27:27,089 --> 02:27:28,569
I'm told you're
looking for a driver.

2147
02:27:29,841 --> 02:27:31,218
What's your name?

2148
02:27:32,177 --> 02:27:33,428
Sonny Hayes.

2149
02:27:37,891 --> 02:27:39,560
Have you ever driven Baja?

2150
02:27:40,686 --> 02:27:41,687
Nope.

2151
02:27:42,479 --> 02:27:43,689
We can't pay much.

2152
02:27:44,273 --> 02:27:45,566
Not about the money.

2153
02:27:50,320 --> 02:27:51,697
