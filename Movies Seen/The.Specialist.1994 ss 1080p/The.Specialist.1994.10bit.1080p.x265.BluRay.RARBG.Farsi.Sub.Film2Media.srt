1
00:01:09,486 --> 00:01:10,652
Nice view.

2
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:02,955
Perfect timing.

3
00:02:15,009 --> 00:02:17,177
Wait a minute. He's not alone.

4
00:02:17,345 --> 00:02:19,388
That's a heartbreaking piece of news.

5
00:02:19,556 --> 00:02:21,640
Pull the plug, Ned.
There's a kid in the car.

6
00:02:21,808 --> 00:02:23,559
There's a drug lord in the car, Ray.

7
00:02:23,852 --> 00:02:26,770
- Kid just took a bad ride, that's all.
- Abort the action.

8
00:02:26,938 --> 00:02:29,898
You're the rigger.
I am the trigger. I make the call.

9
00:02:30,066 --> 00:02:34,278
You just sit back and watch the show.
Okay, sport?

10
00:02:35,738 --> 00:02:37,948
Activate the fail-safe,
you fucking psycho.

11
00:02:38,658 --> 00:02:41,285
Here's a tip, Ray. There is no fail-safe.

12
00:02:41,911 --> 00:02:43,495
Come on. Come on.

13
00:03:06,102 --> 00:03:07,352
You'll never make it.

14
00:04:15,964 --> 00:04:18,340
You're an arrogant man, Raymond.

15
00:04:18,508 --> 00:04:21,969
I taught you everything you know
and you dare to turn on me.

16
00:04:22,136 --> 00:04:23,762
Are you gonna kill me too, colonel?

17
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:26,890
You're a specialist, captain.
You deserve better.

18
00:04:39,237 --> 00:04:41,029
Don't forget to write, partner.

19
00:05:06,889 --> 00:05:09,599
You like watching her die?
You like taking them down?

20
00:05:09,767 --> 00:05:13,520
Now I'm taking you down.
You're finished in the agency.

21
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:15,897
You're going nowhere.

22
00:05:16,065 --> 00:05:18,942
You're as dead as those people...

23
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:21,111
...in the river.

24
00:05:21,654 --> 00:05:22,738
We both are.

25
00:05:38,046 --> 00:05:41,715
Well, slip away

26
00:05:46,846 --> 00:05:53,685
Stuck inside this lonely place

27
00:05:53,853 --> 00:05:57,773
Wonderin' if I'm ever gonna
See your face

28
00:05:57,940 --> 00:06:01,234
It can bring you down

29
00:06:01,402 --> 00:06:07,949
While this world goes round

30
00:06:08,117 --> 00:06:14,331
Time still inside my room

31
00:06:14,499 --> 00:06:19,044
You know it's not too late
Can't be too soon

32
00:06:19,212 --> 00:06:22,714
To be lost and found

33
00:06:22,882 --> 00:06:27,386
To be up and down

34
00:06:27,553 --> 00:06:34,726
And though the world
May close around you

35
00:06:34,894 --> 00:06:37,896
Won't let you slip away

36
00:06:38,064 --> 00:06:42,484
Can't let you slip away from me

37
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:15,934
Have you decided to take the job?

38
00:07:16,102 --> 00:07:17,936
I saw your ad today.

39
00:07:18,104 --> 00:07:20,105
- I know it's late...
- It's never too late.

40
00:07:20,273 --> 00:07:23,275
After all,
you're about to give me a new life.

41
00:07:24,527 --> 00:07:25,527
Really? When?

42
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:27,946
When you kill those three bastards.

43
00:07:28,114 --> 00:07:30,282
I'm flattered.

44
00:07:30,658 --> 00:07:33,034
Look, you better get somebody else.

45
00:07:33,202 --> 00:07:35,203
I like your voice.

46
00:07:35,371 --> 00:07:37,914
Yeah, but you don't need
an explosives contractor.

47
00:07:38,082 --> 00:07:40,208
Yes, I do.

48
00:07:40,918 --> 00:07:43,211
- You are my only hope.
- Go to court, use the law.

49
00:07:43,379 --> 00:07:45,505
The law's been bought.

50
00:07:46,716 --> 00:07:49,259
- Then you gotta use a bullet.
- Bullets...

51
00:07:49,427 --> 00:07:50,594
...are imprecise.

52
00:07:50,761 --> 00:07:55,098
I heard that you control your explosions,
that you shape your charges.

53
00:07:55,266 --> 00:07:57,726
What I shape and who I shape them for
is my business.

54
00:07:57,894 --> 00:07:59,269
All I'm saying...

55
00:07:59,437 --> 00:08:01,938
...word is you were the best.

56
00:08:02,106 --> 00:08:03,356
Whose word?

57
00:08:03,524 --> 00:08:04,983
If we could just meet...

58
00:08:05,151 --> 00:08:08,403
I don't meet, I don't work in Miami
and I don't do jobs like this.

59
00:08:08,571 --> 00:08:11,239
Then why do you keep calling me back?

60
00:08:11,407 --> 00:08:13,116
Why?

61
00:08:13,284 --> 00:08:14,367
I like your voice.

62
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:03,041
What is it? My cologne?

63
00:09:21,644 --> 00:09:23,144
So, what do you think? You guys coming?

64
00:09:23,312 --> 00:09:24,312
Go ahead, please.

65
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:25,981
Right.
- How many are there?

66
00:09:26,148 --> 00:09:27,399
Two or eight?

67
00:10:20,411 --> 00:10:23,371
These guys
are killers. You'd be doing the world a favor.

68
00:10:23,539 --> 00:10:27,083
I don't owe the world any favors.
Why did you wait so long?

69
00:10:27,251 --> 00:10:28,293
I thought...

70
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:32,047
I thought maybe it would pass.

71
00:10:32,214 --> 00:10:34,674
Every day is worse.

72
00:10:35,009 --> 00:10:37,010
Remembering what happened.

73
00:10:37,178 --> 00:10:40,013
That's what I do instead of being alive.

74
00:10:40,431 --> 00:10:43,266
My father hid me in a closet.

75
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:46,061
I could still see.

76
00:10:47,521 --> 00:10:49,147
My mother suffered.

77
00:10:50,149 --> 00:10:51,816
- No.
- I don't know anything.

78
00:10:51,984 --> 00:10:54,027
They tortured her to get my father to talk.

79
00:10:54,195 --> 00:10:55,570
We're gonna have to kill her.

80
00:10:55,988 --> 00:10:58,448
He walked by something
he shouldn't have seen.

81
00:11:00,576 --> 00:11:03,119
They covered his face
with the pillow from my bed.

82
00:11:03,579 --> 00:11:05,038
- Mommy.
- Waste him.

83
00:11:05,623 --> 00:11:07,040
But it was too small.

84
00:11:07,958 --> 00:11:09,501
So they shot him.

85
00:11:11,253 --> 00:11:14,381
I never thought
blood would be so sticky.

86
00:11:15,758 --> 00:11:18,301
Sometimes I think I can never wash it off.

87
00:11:30,106 --> 00:11:33,650
The only thing I understand
anymore is revenge.

88
00:11:33,818 --> 00:11:36,444
I'm going in and I'm gonna do it myself.

89
00:11:36,612 --> 00:11:39,030
You'll only get one of them.
That's why I need you.

90
00:11:41,450 --> 00:11:42,992
- To do it right.
I told you...

91
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:45,453
...I don't do this kind of job anymore.

92
00:12:01,303 --> 00:12:04,556
I know
you've been watching me, trying to decide...

93
00:12:04,724 --> 00:12:08,643
...if I'm on the level,
if you're gonna take the job.

94
00:12:08,811 --> 00:12:10,729
Well, I can't wait anymore, I'm going in.

95
00:12:10,896 --> 00:12:13,648
They'll make you.
I have an alias.

96
00:12:13,816 --> 00:12:15,316
Adrian Hastings.

97
00:12:15,484 --> 00:12:17,318
Wish me luck.

98
00:12:50,186 --> 00:12:51,519
Señor Leon.

99
00:12:55,357 --> 00:12:58,109
So how's it coming in?

100
00:12:59,987 --> 00:13:01,988
Oh, boy. You don't give up. Hmm?

101
00:13:03,574 --> 00:13:07,243
It's packed in Monopoly boxes.

102
00:13:07,411 --> 00:13:09,496
He's right over here.
I want you to meet him.

103
00:13:09,663 --> 00:13:11,498
That's great, Papa.

104
00:13:11,665 --> 00:13:16,377
- You get it in, I'll put it on the street.
- Sure, sure, sure. You do that.

105
00:13:18,714 --> 00:13:20,840
Tomayo, come here.

106
00:13:21,008 --> 00:13:24,135
- Ahem. How you doing, Ned?
- This is a very nice party.

107
00:13:24,303 --> 00:13:27,430
- Yeah.
- You went all out. It's fantastic.

108
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:33,311
- So let's talk numbers.
- Forget business tonight.

109
00:13:33,479 --> 00:13:36,397
Go grab yourself a nice little mulatta.

110
00:13:37,566 --> 00:13:40,068
I want my money, Tomayo.

111
00:13:42,029 --> 00:13:45,073
An advance.
Small token of my family's goodwill.

112
00:13:45,241 --> 00:13:46,950
Token?

113
00:13:47,493 --> 00:13:49,077
Token.

114
00:13:52,414 --> 00:13:54,457
Now, listen to me, boy.

115
00:13:54,625 --> 00:13:56,084
You know what the Dark Ages are?

116
00:13:56,252 --> 00:13:59,128
The Dark Ages are what I brought
the Leon family out of.

117
00:13:59,296 --> 00:14:00,880
I computerized your operation.

118
00:14:01,048 --> 00:14:05,927
I streamlined your security.
I dragged you into the 20th century.

119
00:14:06,428 --> 00:14:08,638
So don't fuck with me on this.

120
00:14:08,806 --> 00:14:10,139
What is this?

121
00:14:10,307 --> 00:14:13,643
A tip? I don't work for tips.
She works for tips, okay?

122
00:14:13,811 --> 00:14:16,229
Now, I want my money. I want it now.

123
00:14:16,397 --> 00:14:18,314
Go get it.

124
00:14:19,358 --> 00:14:22,485
It's always a pleasure working
with you, Ned.

125
00:15:09,533 --> 00:15:11,200
Champagne, please.

126
00:15:34,016 --> 00:15:35,892
Thank you.

127
00:16:15,391 --> 00:16:17,725
Is there something you want?

128
00:16:19,061 --> 00:16:21,896
What I want, I take.

129
00:16:22,064 --> 00:16:23,439
Champagne?

130
00:16:24,149 --> 00:16:26,192
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

131
00:16:29,571 --> 00:16:31,906
Welcome to our bank.

132
00:16:32,908 --> 00:16:35,410
I've never seen you before.

133
00:16:36,036 --> 00:16:38,121
I used to live here when I was a little girl.

134
00:16:39,248 --> 00:16:41,082
A lot's happened
since you've been gone.

135
00:16:41,917 --> 00:16:43,251
Like what?

136
00:16:43,419 --> 00:16:44,460
Like me.

137
00:16:46,171 --> 00:16:48,715
Insecurity is a terrible thing.

138
00:16:48,882 --> 00:16:50,049
It would be.

139
00:16:52,636 --> 00:16:53,761
I'd like to dance.

140
00:16:53,929 --> 00:16:56,139
What's wrong with keeping
the conversation?

141
00:16:56,306 --> 00:16:59,267
Later. Right now, I'm taking what I want.

142
00:17:02,229 --> 00:17:04,689
You look beautiful tonight.

143
00:17:40,893 --> 00:17:46,731
I'll have my driver to pick you up tomorrow
and I'll show you my Miami.

144
00:18:04,291 --> 00:18:06,250
Now.

145
00:18:08,003 --> 00:18:10,171
Right on time.

146
00:18:19,473 --> 00:18:21,641
Should I do it, Timer?

147
00:18:29,483 --> 00:18:31,359
Morning, sir.

148
00:18:33,112 --> 00:18:34,862
Yeah.

149
00:18:40,077 --> 00:18:41,786
Hey.

150
00:18:41,954 --> 00:18:43,746
- Hey, let him play.
- Hey, baby.

151
00:18:43,914 --> 00:18:45,248
- Come on.
Kind of young...

152
00:18:45,415 --> 00:18:48,042
...to be riding this bus alone, aren't you?
Stop it.

153
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:50,878
- What? Not good enough for you?
Come on, young one.

154
00:18:51,046 --> 00:18:52,713
Don't move over. I wanna play.

155
00:18:52,881 --> 00:18:54,507
Come on, baby.

156
00:18:55,884 --> 00:18:57,176
Come on.
Stop. Leave me alone.

157
00:18:57,344 --> 00:18:58,636
Come on now, what's up, huh?

158
00:19:04,768 --> 00:19:06,561
Yeah.

159
00:19:06,979 --> 00:19:08,813
Come on, baby. Don't be shy.

160
00:19:08,981 --> 00:19:11,357
Here, why don't you take my seat?

161
00:19:12,401 --> 00:19:13,985
Thank you.

162
00:19:15,404 --> 00:19:17,530
- Whoa!
- Yo, check her out, man.

163
00:19:18,073 --> 00:19:19,949
Ooh. Yeah.

164
00:19:20,617 --> 00:19:21,659
That seat's taken.

165
00:19:21,827 --> 00:19:24,203
Quit it. Ah!
- Fuck you.

166
00:19:25,122 --> 00:19:27,707
- Excuse me?
- Fuck you.

167
00:19:27,875 --> 00:19:29,417
Come on.

168
00:19:29,751 --> 00:19:30,960
It's all right.

169
00:19:34,965 --> 00:19:37,091
Hold these, please.

170
00:19:37,259 --> 00:19:38,676
Give it back to her.

171
00:19:38,844 --> 00:19:40,469
Stop.

172
00:19:46,602 --> 00:19:47,768
Hey.

173
00:19:49,813 --> 00:19:51,898
What's going on?

174
00:19:52,774 --> 00:19:53,774
You asshole!

175
00:19:53,942 --> 00:19:55,026
Stop that!

176
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,658
You're dead.

177
00:20:08,582 --> 00:20:10,917
I hate knives.

178
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:19,091
Fuck you, you son of a... Oh!

179
00:20:35,817 --> 00:20:38,236
I believe there's a vacancy.

180
00:21:17,651 --> 00:21:19,610
- So, what do you drink?
- Martini.

181
00:21:21,321 --> 00:21:25,533
Martini on the rocks.
Gold tequila, straight up.

182
00:21:27,286 --> 00:21:29,328
No one knows Miami like I do.

183
00:21:31,206 --> 00:21:33,582
You like spending the day with me?

184
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:35,126
Yeah.

185
00:21:36,586 --> 00:21:39,005
- Do you?
- Mm-hm.

186
00:21:39,172 --> 00:21:41,841
- Kiss me.
- Hardly know you.

187
00:21:47,389 --> 00:21:50,057
Wait till you try spending the night.

188
00:22:00,569 --> 00:22:02,278
Thanks.

189
00:22:20,464 --> 00:22:22,465
Stay here. I gotta take care of something.

190
00:22:23,550 --> 00:22:25,343
Got a light?

191
00:22:32,434 --> 00:22:34,643
Is this that piece of shit? Hmm?

192
00:22:46,656 --> 00:22:49,033
Where were you?
- I was home.

193
00:22:52,871 --> 00:22:54,121
Thanks.

194
00:23:12,641 --> 00:23:14,642
Thanks, amigo.

195
00:23:22,567 --> 00:23:24,527
What happened to you?

196
00:23:24,986 --> 00:23:28,114
- I just didn't like the show, that's all.
- Uh-huh.

197
00:23:28,448 --> 00:23:30,324
You don't...

198
00:23:30,492 --> 00:23:32,410
...walk away from me...

199
00:23:33,995 --> 00:23:35,371
...ever.

200
00:23:36,164 --> 00:23:37,706
You understand?

201
00:23:38,458 --> 00:23:39,500
Sorry.

202
00:23:41,503 --> 00:23:43,671
- Get in the car.
- Sure.

203
00:24:06,695 --> 00:24:08,654
Every time...

204
00:24:09,322 --> 00:24:11,574
...he touches me, I...

205
00:24:13,076 --> 00:24:16,495
I mean,
he's the man who shot my father.

206
00:24:16,663 --> 00:24:18,205
And he's...

207
00:24:20,459 --> 00:24:23,043
...kissing me and...

208
00:24:23,712 --> 00:24:25,754
Oh, God.

209
00:24:26,756 --> 00:24:28,716
You don't have to do it.

210
00:24:28,884 --> 00:24:32,720
It's the only way I can get
close enough to kill him.

211
00:24:37,058 --> 00:24:39,894
See, I have this dream.

212
00:24:40,061 --> 00:24:42,980
I'm right there when it happens.

213
00:24:43,315 --> 00:24:47,193
He looks at me like I'm a stranger.

214
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:49,653
Then I say my name.

215
00:24:50,989 --> 00:24:55,618
And it's the last thing he ever hears.

216
00:24:56,328 --> 00:24:57,661
They don't suspect you?

217
00:24:57,829 --> 00:25:00,789
I'm trusted, for the moment.

218
00:25:03,210 --> 00:25:05,085
He's with you all the time. How do you live?

219
00:25:05,253 --> 00:25:06,795
Alone.

220
00:25:07,964 --> 00:25:09,632
That's not what I mean.

221
00:25:10,091 --> 00:25:12,092
How do you live...

222
00:25:12,761 --> 00:25:13,761
...with yourself?

223
00:25:13,929 --> 00:25:15,930
How do you?

224
00:26:32,674 --> 00:26:34,341
Hey, you.

225
00:26:36,845 --> 00:26:38,053
Yeah, I'm talking to you.

226
00:26:41,349 --> 00:26:42,516
You think you know me?

227
00:26:43,476 --> 00:26:46,186
I asked you a question.
You think you know me?

228
00:26:47,188 --> 00:26:50,190
Because the way you're looking at me,
we must be old friends.

229
00:26:50,358 --> 00:26:52,484
Where did we meet?

230
00:26:52,652 --> 00:26:56,030
Nowhere.

231
00:26:57,365 --> 00:26:59,366
You like the bitch? Huh?

232
00:27:06,166 --> 00:27:08,000
Maybe you like me.

233
00:27:10,462 --> 00:27:11,712
No, I don't like you.

234
00:27:13,882 --> 00:27:16,342
Then don't stare so hard.

235
00:27:16,509 --> 00:27:18,969
Somebody could...

236
00:27:20,055 --> 00:27:21,430
...put something in your eye.

237
00:27:33,818 --> 00:27:36,403
Fucking pervert.

238
00:27:44,913 --> 00:27:46,789
Let's move it.

239
00:28:03,264 --> 00:28:05,015
Good night.

240
00:28:09,729 --> 00:28:11,438
- Adrian.
- Mm.

241
00:29:27,390 --> 00:29:30,517
- Yeah.
Are you listening?

242
00:29:31,311 --> 00:29:32,352
Uh-huh.

243
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:33,729
First rule:

244
00:29:34,063 --> 00:29:36,857
Don't go near them again.

245
00:29:37,025 --> 00:29:38,984
Second rule:

246
00:29:39,152 --> 00:29:40,903
Don't contact me.

247
00:29:41,070 --> 00:29:44,406
- I'll contact you.
- Maybe I can help you.

248
00:29:44,574 --> 00:29:46,784
- Let me see...
- No.

249
00:29:46,951 --> 00:29:49,495
They're my problem now and I'm theirs.

250
00:29:53,082 --> 00:29:55,209
Are you close enough to walk over?

251
00:30:03,885 --> 00:30:05,886
Rule three:

252
00:30:06,846 --> 00:30:08,388
If this is a setup...

253
00:30:09,265 --> 00:30:11,767
...I kill you.

254
00:30:49,430 --> 00:30:51,849
- Hey, Manny.
- Now what?

255
00:30:52,016 --> 00:30:54,935
I'm serious. That cop was a regular.
Juanita's moving in on me.

256
00:30:55,103 --> 00:30:58,480
Get the hell out of here.
I don't solve domestic problems.

257
00:30:58,648 --> 00:31:00,357
Asshole.

258
00:31:22,964 --> 00:31:24,923
Don't go anywhere.
I'll be right back.

259
00:31:26,301 --> 00:31:28,468
Lucky me.

260
00:32:00,335 --> 00:32:02,377
Hey, Charlie.

261
00:32:14,182 --> 00:32:15,891
JB.

262
00:32:18,061 --> 00:32:20,187
The word is, Manny...

263
00:32:20,355 --> 00:32:21,480
...you're skimming.

264
00:32:22,523 --> 00:32:26,693
Somebody's lying.
Hey, hey, I never took a dollar.

265
00:32:26,861 --> 00:32:28,862
I hope it ain't you.

266
00:32:29,322 --> 00:32:32,282
Because if you're trying
to screw Joe Leon...

267
00:32:32,450 --> 00:32:36,703
Charlie, you've known me,
what, 10 years?

268
00:32:37,372 --> 00:32:39,873
- Hey, I'm clean.
- Good.

269
00:32:40,249 --> 00:32:42,209
Very good.

270
00:32:42,543 --> 00:32:45,128
Then you have nothing to worry about,
do you?

271
00:32:47,048 --> 00:32:48,173
Let me see the books.

272
00:33:18,621 --> 00:33:21,415
I can't take this anymore.
That is it. What?

273
00:33:21,582 --> 00:33:24,376
- How about a drink?
- Sure.

274
00:33:28,256 --> 00:33:29,297
September's missing.

275
00:33:31,050 --> 00:33:33,010
See you, Manny.

276
00:33:45,314 --> 00:33:46,732
What do you feel like doing?

277
00:33:58,786 --> 00:34:00,203
What?

278
00:34:00,371 --> 00:34:02,122
I'm working here.

279
00:34:02,290 --> 00:34:03,790
You have two fucking hours.

280
00:34:21,642 --> 00:34:23,143
Get another job, kid.

281
00:34:36,032 --> 00:34:39,493
They got two bodies in there.
Something that used to be Charlie...

282
00:34:39,660 --> 00:34:41,703
...and a clean hit
on your brothel manager.

283
00:34:41,871 --> 00:34:42,954
That was a bright move.

284
00:34:43,122 --> 00:34:45,582
Something you ordered
and didn't tell me about?

285
00:34:45,750 --> 00:34:46,792
He was a thief.

286
00:34:47,293 --> 00:34:49,211
- Tell me about the bomb.
Very clean.

287
00:34:49,670 --> 00:34:52,255
There was no damage
to the left or right of the blast.

288
00:34:52,423 --> 00:34:55,509
The item that was used to set it off
was impacted inside the C4...

289
00:34:55,676 --> 00:34:58,553
...so the arming device was vaporized.
Brilliant, professional.

290
00:34:58,721 --> 00:35:00,180
Gotta be a specialist.

291
00:35:00,556 --> 00:35:02,682
- This guy is good, Joe.
- Yeah, okay.

292
00:35:02,850 --> 00:35:06,228
He could put a bomb in your crab shell
you wouldn't even know it.

293
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:09,314
I'll kill the son of a bitch.

294
00:35:09,482 --> 00:35:13,068
You can't kill anybody,
Tomayo, until we know who he is, can you?

295
00:35:14,237 --> 00:35:15,570
I'll find him.

296
00:35:15,738 --> 00:35:18,573
The important thing to find out,
who he works for.

297
00:35:19,408 --> 00:35:20,700
Maybe he works for the CIA.

298
00:35:20,868 --> 00:35:23,537
Maybe he works for the Mafia,
the Italians, I don't know...

299
00:35:23,704 --> 00:35:26,039
...but we have to find out who, okay?

300
00:35:26,207 --> 00:35:27,207
Overview, Joe.

301
00:35:28,042 --> 00:35:31,002
We have to ask ourselves
what does eliminating Charlie mean...

302
00:35:31,170 --> 00:35:32,879
...in the overall picture?
- Nothing.

303
00:35:33,047 --> 00:35:35,465
Less than nothing.
So this target wasn't territorial.

304
00:35:35,883 --> 00:35:36,925
It was personal.

305
00:35:38,302 --> 00:35:40,345
How the fuck do you know so much?

306
00:35:40,513 --> 00:35:44,224
He's guessing, Pop. Let me take a couple
of the boys, I'll find out who this is.

307
00:35:44,392 --> 00:35:47,435
Wait a minute. Give me a second here.
I have to make a decision.

308
00:35:49,230 --> 00:35:52,107
Little time to think here, huh?

309
00:35:55,069 --> 00:35:57,112
Okay.

310
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:58,530
You take over, okay?

311
00:35:59,448 --> 00:36:03,118
- Papa...
- I said, Trent will handle it, okay?

312
00:36:03,286 --> 00:36:05,495
- I don't hear you saying "okay."
- Okay, Papa.

313
00:36:05,663 --> 00:36:07,080
- What did you say?
- Okay, Papa.

314
00:36:07,248 --> 00:36:09,249
That's nice. Thank you.

315
00:36:11,878 --> 00:36:13,795
Fuck you.

316
00:36:16,132 --> 00:36:18,842
I'm gonna need resources
on this one, Joe.

317
00:36:19,010 --> 00:36:21,595
And also, the place was crawling
with cops.

318
00:36:21,762 --> 00:36:24,848
I can't be tripping over fucking
civil servants every move I make.

319
00:36:25,016 --> 00:36:28,602
- I need total control.
- Yeah, okay, well, I will...

320
00:36:28,769 --> 00:36:31,646
I will take care of that, you know?

321
00:36:34,942 --> 00:36:38,028
Personally. Okay?

322
00:38:00,111 --> 00:38:02,070
Hello, Timer.

323
00:38:02,655 --> 00:38:04,823
Having a good day?

324
00:38:08,536 --> 00:38:09,744
Okay.

325
00:38:09,912 --> 00:38:13,331
Here you go. Knock yourself out.

326
00:38:47,450 --> 00:38:49,576
I saw it on the news.

327
00:38:50,036 --> 00:38:52,245
You got the first one.

328
00:38:52,413 --> 00:38:53,663
Thank you.

329
00:38:54,290 --> 00:38:57,751
- Thank you.
Well, I'm just doing my job.

330
00:38:57,918 --> 00:39:00,628
- You gotta stay away from the other two.
I could help you.

331
00:39:00,796 --> 00:39:03,006
I could set them up for you.

332
00:39:03,174 --> 00:39:06,176
No, no.
You just stay away from those guys.

333
00:39:06,719 --> 00:39:09,804
Their future is about to become very dark.

334
00:39:09,972 --> 00:39:14,434
You're still following me. Aren't you?

335
00:39:15,936 --> 00:39:18,688
- It's gotten so I can feel you.
It's all part of the work.

336
00:39:20,066 --> 00:39:21,608
Do you think about me?

337
00:39:21,776 --> 00:39:23,902
I think about you.

338
00:39:24,070 --> 00:39:26,154
My own personal ghost.

339
00:39:27,239 --> 00:39:28,365
Or angel maybe.

340
00:39:29,617 --> 00:39:32,077
- We could meet.
You are a beautiful woman.

341
00:39:32,787 --> 00:39:33,953
But I don't meet.

342
00:39:34,121 --> 00:39:37,957
- When this is over, I should leave.
When are you gonna do it?

343
00:39:38,751 --> 00:39:39,959
Soon.

344
00:39:40,127 --> 00:39:42,212
Very soon.

345
00:39:48,302 --> 00:39:50,261
Trent, you know the chief of police.

346
00:39:50,429 --> 00:39:52,764
Trent is gonna work with us
on this problem.

347
00:39:52,932 --> 00:39:57,310
You know,
I mean, he was a former employee of the...

348
00:39:57,478 --> 00:39:58,978
...CIA.

349
00:39:59,146 --> 00:40:03,483
And he is an explosives expert
and I think he can be a big help.

350
00:40:03,651 --> 00:40:04,651
I don't know.

351
00:40:04,819 --> 00:40:07,987
This has become very public,
I'm sure you wanna keep a low profile.

352
00:40:09,448 --> 00:40:11,366
Yeah, please.

353
00:40:11,534 --> 00:40:14,411
It'd be hard for Ned to go unnoticed,
if you know what I mean.

354
00:40:15,496 --> 00:40:19,207
Well, you know, I think there's more
involved here than keeping a low profile.

355
00:40:22,002 --> 00:40:26,297
I say that I'm the one you can trust,
which is the main word here, Joe. Trust.

356
00:40:26,465 --> 00:40:29,509
- To take him out clean.
- Our bomb boys are some of the best.

357
00:40:29,677 --> 00:40:31,845
Really, chief? Well, I hope that's true.

358
00:40:32,012 --> 00:40:35,515
They'd better be fucking magicians
because this is one very impressive man.

359
00:40:35,683 --> 00:40:37,016
What are you, a fucking fan?

360
00:40:37,518 --> 00:40:40,562
Okay, come on now.
Stop that, this is serious, right?

361
00:40:40,729 --> 00:40:42,147
Don't you two start.

362
00:40:43,023 --> 00:40:46,276
We're here to find a way to protect
the business. Don't forget that.

363
00:40:46,694 --> 00:40:48,862
Is that understood?

364
00:40:49,530 --> 00:40:54,534
Okay, chief, I have tell you
that this one is not negotiable.

365
00:40:54,702 --> 00:40:58,163
Look, Joe, I'll do what I can.
Put him on as a fed or something.

366
00:41:01,375 --> 00:41:02,417
Okay.

367
00:41:05,212 --> 00:41:06,379
- Joe.
- Take care.

368
00:41:06,547 --> 00:41:08,882
Chief, always a pleasure.

369
00:41:09,049 --> 00:41:11,718
Hey, chief, good to see you again.
Hey, Tomas.

370
00:41:11,886 --> 00:41:13,636
See you, Papa.

371
00:41:14,889 --> 00:41:18,349
Okay, Danny, here, help me up.

372
00:41:18,976 --> 00:41:21,561
Oh, boy. I hate that deep couch.

373
00:41:23,439 --> 00:41:27,859
Okay. Now, listen.
Danny, you'll do me a favor.

374
00:41:28,027 --> 00:41:30,904
You do your best to make
this thing look official.

375
00:41:31,405 --> 00:41:34,532
No, please. You do that,
and I promise you...

376
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:36,701
...I will not forget you.

377
00:41:36,869 --> 00:41:37,952
Okay?

378
00:41:40,372 --> 00:41:41,748
Danny.

379
00:41:43,959 --> 00:41:46,169
A man's gotta eat, no? Heh.

380
00:42:01,477 --> 00:42:05,939
Hey, Gonzales, wait up.
I wanna show you those files.

381
00:42:07,566 --> 00:42:10,026
Hey, sport, where's the bomb squad?

382
00:42:20,663 --> 00:42:24,040
Hey, come on, boys and girls.
What are we doing here? Let's look alive.

383
00:42:24,458 --> 00:42:27,335
- What've you got?
- We're into everyone at the party...

384
00:42:27,503 --> 00:42:29,504
...doing a complete
background check, okay?

385
00:42:31,465 --> 00:42:32,924
Give me the next one, all right?

386
00:42:43,644 --> 00:42:48,731
Tell you what, I'll handle the biographies.
You go back to tracing C4. Okay, ace?

387
00:42:50,985 --> 00:42:53,444
Chief says you're on this. Fine.

388
00:42:53,988 --> 00:42:58,157
But I don't take orders from
any ex-anything. All right, ace?

389
00:42:59,868 --> 00:43:02,996
I gotta tell you something.
I'm sorry, I thought your chief said...

390
00:43:03,163 --> 00:43:05,832
...that the fullest cooperation
would be forthcoming.

391
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,334
And I gotta tell you something, sport.

392
00:43:08,502 --> 00:43:10,878
This doesn't feel like full cooperation
to me.

393
00:43:11,046 --> 00:43:13,715
I mean, look at this shit here.
What is this? This is...

394
00:43:13,882 --> 00:43:16,843
Shouldn't this be in the lock-up?
I don't know. Maybe I'm wrong.

395
00:43:17,011 --> 00:43:20,013
You guys are the experts.
Maybe you don't need me.

396
00:43:20,180 --> 00:43:22,890
I mean, like, what is this? This is...

397
00:43:24,059 --> 00:43:25,101
This is Semtex.

398
00:43:25,269 --> 00:43:27,437
Am I right? Plastique.

399
00:43:27,605 --> 00:43:30,732
Plastic explosive. Am I right?
I don't know, you're the expert.

400
00:43:30,899 --> 00:43:34,068
This bit could blow up
this whole area, and if this area goes...

401
00:43:34,236 --> 00:43:36,362
...the whole building could go up.
Am I right?

402
00:43:36,739 --> 00:43:38,197
Gosh, I don't know. I mean...

403
00:43:39,116 --> 00:43:41,242
...maybe if I put this in here...

404
00:43:43,245 --> 00:43:45,038
What else do we have here? Oh.

405
00:43:45,205 --> 00:43:49,292
This is a plunger detonator, am I right?
And that's a little mini receiver.

406
00:43:49,752 --> 00:43:53,630
This looks like American circuitry to me.
And I gotta tell you, call me a patriot...

407
00:43:53,797 --> 00:43:57,258
...but American craftsmanship
it's the greatest in the world.

408
00:43:57,426 --> 00:44:00,637
See? Watch this. Here we go.

409
00:44:00,804 --> 00:44:02,513
Let's just see.

410
00:44:02,681 --> 00:44:07,644
Yup. Perfect fit, first time,
every time. Screw it on.

411
00:44:08,103 --> 00:44:09,479
And one little twist.

412
00:44:09,647 --> 00:44:14,233
And voilà. A perfect receiver bomb.

413
00:44:14,401 --> 00:44:15,985
Which of course is...

414
00:44:16,153 --> 00:44:18,738
...absolutely worthless without a...

415
00:44:19,615 --> 00:44:21,741
...transmitter. Heh-heh-heh.

416
00:44:23,077 --> 00:44:24,827
But hey.

417
00:44:29,416 --> 00:44:31,668
Twenty seconds and we're hot.

418
00:44:32,586 --> 00:44:34,045
Okay?

419
00:44:34,213 --> 00:44:37,256
Okay. Now you deactivate it,
you sanctimonious prick.

420
00:44:37,424 --> 00:44:40,051
- Okay, you cut that shit, Trent.
- Oh, yeah. Huh?

421
00:44:40,219 --> 00:44:42,428
- Come on. Come on.
- Okay, you made your point.

422
00:44:42,596 --> 00:44:44,514
Have I? Huh?

423
00:44:44,682 --> 00:44:46,516
That's enough.
What do you mean?

424
00:44:46,684 --> 00:44:49,894
You think I give a shit if this whole
fucking block goes up? I don't.

425
00:44:50,062 --> 00:44:52,605
Maybe you've had enough.
Isn't that what you're saying?

426
00:44:52,773 --> 00:44:55,066
Yes, that's what I'm saying.
Enough is enough!

427
00:44:55,234 --> 00:44:57,110
- I can't do it.
- Twelve.

428
00:44:57,277 --> 00:44:59,404
What the hell,
are you crazy or something?

429
00:44:59,571 --> 00:45:02,407
I'm the craziest person
you'll ever meet in your life.

430
00:45:03,659 --> 00:45:06,411
Six, five...

431
00:45:06,578 --> 00:45:09,622
...four, three.
- Please.

432
00:45:14,128 --> 00:45:15,420
Whew.

433
00:45:19,550 --> 00:45:21,217
Now, here's a tip.

434
00:45:21,385 --> 00:45:23,594
You take care of the shit work.

435
00:45:24,054 --> 00:45:27,890
And you leave the folks
at the party to me. Okay?

436
00:45:28,058 --> 00:45:30,226
We on the same page here?

437
00:45:32,855 --> 00:45:34,313
Ace.

438
00:46:13,854 --> 00:46:15,938
How do you like it? Those go upstairs.

439
00:46:16,106 --> 00:46:18,357
I like where I live.

440
00:46:19,401 --> 00:46:21,068
I like you where I live.

441
00:46:22,029 --> 00:46:23,488
Thanks.

442
00:46:24,198 --> 00:46:26,699
Close the doors. Get out.

443
00:46:40,464 --> 00:46:41,923
Better than what you're used to?

444
00:46:42,382 --> 00:46:44,383
You know, the next time you order a hit...

445
00:46:44,551 --> 00:46:47,386
...you might wanna consider
taking out your decorator.

446
00:46:51,642 --> 00:46:53,726
You like to live dangerously, don't you?

447
00:46:54,561 --> 00:46:56,979
A little danger never killed anybody.

448
00:46:57,147 --> 00:46:58,773
Right, baby?

449
00:47:00,025 --> 00:47:02,109
Sometimes.

450
00:47:15,707 --> 00:47:17,208
You know...

451
00:47:17,376 --> 00:47:19,669
...when I look at you...

452
00:47:20,921 --> 00:47:24,048
...I see something I like very much.

453
00:47:25,133 --> 00:47:26,175
You know what it is?

454
00:47:26,718 --> 00:47:29,220
I'm breathless with anticipation.

455
00:47:30,472 --> 00:47:31,722
I see me.

456
00:47:44,903 --> 00:47:46,654
Let's get this shit over with.

457
00:48:08,552 --> 00:48:09,844
Wait a minute.

458
00:48:11,263 --> 00:48:13,347
You're the Mob's accountant, Bill.

459
00:48:13,515 --> 00:48:15,641
Is that all you've got for me?

460
00:48:15,809 --> 00:48:19,812
No, no. I have something else for you.

461
00:48:25,152 --> 00:48:26,485
See you guys. Peace.

462
00:48:26,653 --> 00:48:30,573
Don't touch that! It could be a bomb.

463
00:48:32,910 --> 00:48:35,036
Very funny.

464
00:49:46,066 --> 00:49:48,192
Son of a bitch.

465
00:50:05,335 --> 00:50:06,419
Hey, kid.

466
00:50:08,755 --> 00:50:10,923
Look at the way you parked
my fucking car.

467
00:50:12,884 --> 00:50:15,302
Sir, I didn't park your car.

468
00:50:16,847 --> 00:50:19,265
Uh... Sorry. I'll get it for you.

469
00:50:57,846 --> 00:50:59,805
Here's your tip.

470
00:52:30,730 --> 00:52:33,566
Keep
everybody back. Everybody back, please.

471
00:52:36,570 --> 00:52:39,613
- Some ride that must've been.
Black and white coming. Let them in.

472
00:52:39,781 --> 00:52:41,574
Is this the decoy?

473
00:52:42,325 --> 00:52:44,493
Who the fuck was this supposed to fool?

474
00:52:46,580 --> 00:52:49,456
- Any witnesses?
- Over there.

475
00:52:49,708 --> 00:52:51,792
The kid?

476
00:52:52,294 --> 00:52:54,003
Here you go.

477
00:52:55,630 --> 00:52:57,590
Nice one, Ray.

478
00:52:58,091 --> 00:52:59,884
Clever boy.

479
00:53:05,098 --> 00:53:06,140
- Ooh.
Everybody back.

480
00:53:08,602 --> 00:53:10,644
"Bye-bye."

481
00:53:11,104 --> 00:53:13,397
Well, at least he hasn't lost
his sense of humor.

482
00:53:19,112 --> 00:53:20,946
Who gave you permission to smile?

483
00:53:21,615 --> 00:53:22,907
Shut up.

484
00:53:46,973 --> 00:53:49,475
Quite a step up for you, isn't it?

485
00:53:49,643 --> 00:53:52,144
Depends on how you look at it.

486
00:53:52,312 --> 00:53:55,564
- Look, Ned, Tomas is on his way...
- Shut up.

487
00:53:55,732 --> 00:53:58,192
Who are you? Hmm?

488
00:53:58,360 --> 00:54:00,069
I said, who are you?

489
00:54:00,612 --> 00:54:01,820
Who are you? Huh?

490
00:54:01,988 --> 00:54:05,157
I'll tell you who you are. You are nobody.

491
00:54:05,325 --> 00:54:08,327
I created Adrian Hastings.
I got you inside.

492
00:54:08,495 --> 00:54:11,705
You work for me. And please
don't you ever fucking forget it.

493
00:54:13,917 --> 00:54:16,502
Now, you're supposed to have him
out in the open by now.

494
00:54:16,670 --> 00:54:18,837
You get your three corpses,
I get Ray Quick.

495
00:54:19,005 --> 00:54:21,757
That was the bargain.
What happened, May?

496
00:54:21,925 --> 00:54:24,718
I can't keep him on the line
long enough to get a trace.

497
00:54:24,886 --> 00:54:26,512
He doesn't wanna take a meeting.

498
00:54:27,347 --> 00:54:29,890
What do you want me to do, Ned?
Wish him out of hiding?

499
00:54:30,058 --> 00:54:31,934
Maybe you're in over your head on this.

500
00:54:32,102 --> 00:54:34,812
Maybe you've outlived your usefulness.
Is that possible?

501
00:54:34,980 --> 00:54:36,647
Listen, to me, Ned, you need me.

502
00:54:37,607 --> 00:54:39,817
I studied him, I drew him out.

503
00:54:41,528 --> 00:54:44,947
It was my voice, it was my ads.
He trusts me.

504
00:54:45,824 --> 00:54:47,533
Why do I need you, May?

505
00:54:47,951 --> 00:54:51,036
Why don't I just grab him
before he brings Tomas down?

506
00:54:51,204 --> 00:54:53,122
Why do you even need...

507
00:54:53,290 --> 00:54:54,707
...to live at all, May?

508
00:54:54,874 --> 00:54:59,253
Because maybe he's not interested in
a big-mouth, hotshot asshole like you, Ned.

509
00:55:02,257 --> 00:55:05,301
You know what I've always loved
about you, May?

510
00:55:06,511 --> 00:55:08,262
It's not just this...

511
00:55:08,430 --> 00:55:10,222
...poetry.

512
00:55:12,058 --> 00:55:13,851
It's your heart.

513
00:55:14,561 --> 00:55:17,479
It's the heart you bring to your work.

514
00:55:17,981 --> 00:55:20,316
But I promise,
if you don't get him to a meeting...

515
00:55:20,483 --> 00:55:22,443
...before he drops the third target...

516
00:55:22,610 --> 00:55:25,321
...you will pray for a lifetime
of Tomas's attentions...

517
00:55:25,488 --> 00:55:27,740
...his delicate touch.

518
00:55:27,907 --> 00:55:30,242
- I promise.
- Don't touch me, Ned.

519
00:55:30,410 --> 00:55:31,452
I'm sorry.

520
00:55:35,707 --> 00:55:38,000
I've always wondered, May...

521
00:55:39,085 --> 00:55:41,045
...what was it like...

522
00:55:42,297 --> 00:55:44,590
...after you watched your parents die.

523
00:55:44,758 --> 00:55:46,800
Did you go over to the bed?

524
00:55:47,761 --> 00:55:50,846
Did little May hug them?

525
00:55:51,222 --> 00:55:53,766
Did you try to shake them awake?

526
00:55:55,185 --> 00:55:56,602
How much blood?

527
00:55:56,770 --> 00:55:59,188
I'm just curious, was there...

528
00:56:00,357 --> 00:56:02,274
...a lot of blood, May?

529
00:56:02,442 --> 00:56:04,443
Don't push me, Ned.

530
00:56:22,170 --> 00:56:25,964
- What the hell are you doing here?
- Take it easy, hotshot.

531
00:56:26,132 --> 00:56:27,758
I'm just checking up on you.

532
00:56:27,926 --> 00:56:30,636
I don't need you goddamn
babysitting for me, Trent.

533
00:56:31,596 --> 00:56:33,806
Why aren't you out
looking for who's hitting us?

534
00:56:33,973 --> 00:56:36,058
- That's great, Tomas.
- What's the first move?

535
00:56:36,226 --> 00:56:37,434
Door-to-door search?

536
00:56:37,644 --> 00:56:39,353
- Huh?
I'm sick of you.

537
00:56:40,647 --> 00:56:42,439
My father thinks he needs you.

538
00:56:43,233 --> 00:56:45,109
When he finds out he doesn't...

539
00:56:45,276 --> 00:56:46,610
...you're mine.

540
00:56:46,945 --> 00:56:48,654
Well...

541
00:56:50,073 --> 00:56:52,533
...I feel threatened.
- You are threatened.

542
00:58:15,742 --> 00:58:17,451
Tommy, Miguel, you in?
- I'm in, boss.

543
00:58:17,619 --> 00:58:19,161
- Me too.
Come on.

544
00:58:19,329 --> 00:58:21,121
Get it together.

545
00:58:21,289 --> 00:58:23,081
Five hundred.

546
00:58:33,426 --> 00:58:35,636
Okay, I'm out of here.

547
00:59:40,702 --> 00:59:42,035
Just a second.

548
00:59:45,540 --> 00:59:46,873
May Munro.

549
00:59:51,504 --> 00:59:53,422
Come on!

550
00:59:57,760 --> 01:00:00,345
Where are you going?
- Come on! Get up!

551
01:00:00,513 --> 01:00:03,265
Go in there! Get him!
Get the fuck in there!

552
01:00:04,851 --> 01:00:05,976
Get back.

553
01:00:07,353 --> 01:00:09,187
Keep them back.

554
01:00:11,983 --> 01:00:13,025
Come on, get them out!

555
01:00:13,359 --> 01:00:15,736
Get them out!

556
01:00:20,992 --> 01:00:22,784
Good one, Ray.

557
01:00:23,202 --> 01:00:24,870
Really good.

558
01:01:11,250 --> 01:01:13,168
Joe, I am so sorry.

559
01:01:23,012 --> 01:01:25,138
You're sorry?

560
01:01:27,517 --> 01:01:29,685
My son...

561
01:01:31,270 --> 01:01:34,272
...is in a closed casket...

562
01:01:35,608 --> 01:01:40,195
...and you are sorry.

563
01:01:40,363 --> 01:01:43,949
Well, I hold you responsible.

564
01:01:44,826 --> 01:01:45,867
He wouldn't lay low.

565
01:01:46,327 --> 01:01:47,869
What'd you say?

566
01:01:50,998 --> 01:01:52,457
I said, he wouldn't lay low.

567
01:01:52,625 --> 01:01:57,129
Are you trying to tell me
that was his fault now?

568
01:01:57,296 --> 01:01:58,296
That's the way it was.

569
01:01:58,464 --> 01:02:02,175
The way it was?
You were supposed to protect his back.

570
01:02:02,343 --> 01:02:04,344
His life was in your hands.

571
01:02:04,512 --> 01:02:06,304
You know what you do?

572
01:02:06,472 --> 01:02:09,516
You cut my heart out, you know.

573
01:02:09,684 --> 01:02:12,728
And now you look, my...

574
01:02:15,148 --> 01:02:16,982
My son...

575
01:02:17,775 --> 01:02:20,277
...is lying in a box.

576
01:02:20,445 --> 01:02:21,987
- Joe, I...
- And you know...

577
01:02:22,155 --> 01:02:24,156
...you were the one...

578
01:02:24,323 --> 01:02:25,782
...who let it happen.

579
01:02:25,950 --> 01:02:30,162
- Joe, you're not thinking straight.
- Jesus Christ, don't you try to tell me.

580
01:02:30,329 --> 01:02:32,372
I swear to God, don't say another word.

581
01:02:32,540 --> 01:02:34,583
Not another word. I'll kill you here.

582
01:02:34,751 --> 01:02:37,836
You understand? Hmm?

583
01:02:47,221 --> 01:02:48,722
Now...

584
01:02:49,682 --> 01:02:54,311
...you go out...

585
01:02:55,188 --> 01:02:59,274
...you go out and you find
this explosives expert...

586
01:02:59,442 --> 01:03:00,734
...and you...

587
01:03:01,569 --> 01:03:04,362
...bring him to me alive...

588
01:03:04,530 --> 01:03:07,407
...before I bury Tomas.

589
01:04:28,573 --> 01:04:32,075
"Adrian Hastings. Miami.
Services 3 p.m., Friday.

590
01:04:32,243 --> 01:04:33,618
San Juan De Bosco."

591
01:04:33,786 --> 01:04:35,412
Too bad, May.

592
01:04:39,667 --> 01:04:42,043
Her body's in cold storage
at County General.

593
01:04:46,090 --> 01:04:47,132
How does this sound?

594
01:04:47,300 --> 01:04:50,635
"Lonely, needy, deeply hurt.
Will be discreet."

595
01:04:50,803 --> 01:04:53,471
Story of my life.

596
01:04:55,308 --> 01:04:58,310
Yeah. So get this on every major
bulletin board service.

597
01:04:58,477 --> 01:05:00,896
Put the response
through a long-distance exchange...

598
01:05:01,063 --> 01:05:03,982
...and be ready to trace. Okay?
- Okay.

599
01:05:36,349 --> 01:05:38,391
Guys like this,
they're not gonna advertise.

600
01:05:38,559 --> 01:05:41,853
You gotta draw them out.
So just do your best.

601
01:05:44,357 --> 01:05:46,608
Hi, baby. Are you wearing any underwear?

602
01:05:46,776 --> 01:05:47,817
Could you send it to me?

603
01:05:47,985 --> 01:05:51,237
- Get rid of this asshole.
- Yeah, well, I don't think your experience...

604
01:05:51,405 --> 01:05:53,365
...matches my needs.
- Get rid of him.

605
01:05:53,532 --> 01:05:54,908
That's what I'm doing.

606
01:05:55,868 --> 01:05:59,412
We've had 30 calls and nothing.
I don't know if this makes any sense.

607
01:05:59,580 --> 01:06:02,832
You know what? I'll decide if it makes
any sense or not, okay?

608
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:05,460
Go on, take it. Take it.

609
01:06:05,628 --> 01:06:07,462
Line five and...

610
01:06:07,630 --> 01:06:09,422
- Go.
- Hello?

611
01:06:09,757 --> 01:06:12,217
Calling about the ad, right?

612
01:06:14,095 --> 01:06:15,887
Yeah.

613
01:06:16,889 --> 01:06:18,723
Right.

614
01:06:18,891 --> 01:06:20,558
I thought you were someone else.

615
01:06:21,894 --> 01:06:24,312
The ad was similar to others.

616
01:06:24,480 --> 01:06:27,649
Yeah, well, give me a number
because I can't talk on this phone.

617
01:06:27,817 --> 01:06:28,858
No. Forget it.

618
01:06:29,026 --> 01:06:31,027
You have a message from May.

619
01:06:31,195 --> 01:06:33,530
I've got a message...

620
01:06:33,698 --> 01:06:34,948
...from May.

621
01:06:36,575 --> 01:06:38,451
- Who is this?
- She's okay.

622
01:06:39,120 --> 01:06:40,328
She wants to meet you.

623
01:06:41,205 --> 01:06:42,747
No, I don't think so.

624
01:06:46,961 --> 01:06:48,670
Put Trent on the line.

625
01:06:48,838 --> 01:06:49,879
What did you say?

626
01:06:50,047 --> 01:06:52,882
Trent should be standing next to you.
I wanna talk to him.

627
01:06:55,261 --> 01:06:56,386
Put him on the line.

628
01:06:59,432 --> 01:07:01,641
Hey, Ned, can you hear me?

629
01:07:02,643 --> 01:07:05,020
Come on, talk to me.
Come on, talk to me, Ned.

630
01:07:05,187 --> 01:07:06,688
New playmates know what kind of man...

631
01:07:06,856 --> 01:07:09,149
...they're dealing with?
Why the agency fired you? Huh?

632
01:07:10,317 --> 01:07:13,278
That killing people, pulling the trigger
was like jerking off?

633
01:07:13,446 --> 01:07:17,032
Watching bloody bodies going
though the air is what gets you off.

634
01:07:17,199 --> 01:07:19,451
- Come on, talk to me, Ned.
- I need time.

635
01:07:19,618 --> 01:07:23,621
When you crawl into your hole all alone,
and you are alone, aren't you, big guy?

636
01:07:23,789 --> 01:07:25,498
Tell me what burns you the most.

637
01:07:26,375 --> 01:07:28,918
Losing your job as a CIA attack dog...

638
01:07:29,086 --> 01:07:32,589
...or knowing that I turned you in
and I'm still alive?

639
01:07:32,757 --> 01:07:34,424
Come on, talk to me.

640
01:07:35,092 --> 01:07:38,636
You sell your service to the highest bidder,
won't you, you stinking maggot.

641
01:07:38,804 --> 01:07:42,807
Fuck you, Ray! Fuck you! You killed!

642
01:07:42,975 --> 01:07:44,059
Your bombs!

643
01:07:44,226 --> 01:07:47,979
How many? Ten? Fifty?
A hundred before you lost count?

644
01:07:48,147 --> 01:07:52,650
It was your bombs on the bridge in Bogotá.
Your bomb in the cabana.

645
01:07:52,818 --> 01:07:55,612
But you're getting sloppy, Ray.
You broke your famous code.

646
01:07:56,072 --> 01:08:00,283
You killed an innocent bystander, Ray.
It is just eating you up inside, isn't it?

647
01:08:00,451 --> 01:08:03,661
Well, you were always
too fucking sensitive. But guess what.

648
01:08:03,829 --> 01:08:07,165
I'm coming, Ray.
I'm coming to take all the pain away.

649
01:08:07,333 --> 01:08:09,334
I'm gonna fucking cut it
right out of you...

650
01:08:09,502 --> 01:08:11,544
...and I'm gonna close your heart
in my hand.

651
01:08:11,712 --> 01:08:14,506
I'm right behind you and I know you.
I know you.

652
01:08:14,673 --> 01:08:19,010
You've got no mercy.
You got no fucking loyalty.

653
01:08:19,178 --> 01:08:20,553
And you got no code.

654
01:08:20,721 --> 01:08:24,015
- Listen to me, you son of a bitch...
- Hey, time's up, 58 seconds.

655
01:08:24,183 --> 01:08:27,727
Ray. Ray. God... Wait.

656
01:08:28,562 --> 01:08:30,814
Goddamn it! Son of a bitch!

657
01:08:30,981 --> 01:08:33,483
I'll fucking kill you! I'll vaporize your ass!

658
01:08:33,651 --> 01:08:35,693
What're you looking at?

659
01:08:38,697 --> 01:08:40,365
Turn around!

660
01:08:47,456 --> 01:08:48,748
Nobody...

661
01:08:48,916 --> 01:08:50,959
...says a word.

662
01:08:53,212 --> 01:08:55,588
Now you tell me that you got a trace.

663
01:08:55,756 --> 01:08:57,382
Just tell me.

664
01:08:57,550 --> 01:08:59,342
He jumped off before we locked him.

665
01:08:59,510 --> 01:09:00,927
- Okay.
- We got a partial trace.

666
01:09:01,095 --> 01:09:02,762
Shut up.

667
01:09:28,581 --> 01:09:30,957
She gave of herself...

668
01:09:31,500 --> 01:09:33,751
...for 40 years.

669
01:09:33,919 --> 01:09:36,671
She dedicated her life...

670
01:09:36,839 --> 01:09:38,381
...generously...

671
01:09:38,549 --> 01:09:40,633
...courageously...

672
01:09:40,801 --> 01:09:43,803
...to all of us,
Cuban orphans everywhere.

673
01:09:45,931 --> 01:09:47,432
She has shown us the road.

674
01:09:49,101 --> 01:09:51,853
For the wages sin pays is death.

675
01:09:52,605 --> 01:09:55,023
But the gift God gives...

676
01:09:55,191 --> 01:09:56,900
...is everlasting life...

677
01:09:57,067 --> 01:09:59,569
...by Christ, Jesus, our Lord.

678
01:11:03,425 --> 01:11:04,717
So how did I look?

679
01:11:43,048 --> 01:11:44,215
Why did you do this?

680
01:11:45,259 --> 01:11:47,051
I wanted to meet you.

681
01:11:49,555 --> 01:11:52,724
I wanted to know if you were
everything I thought you'd be.

682
01:11:53,142 --> 01:11:54,892
Nobody ever is.

683
01:12:20,502 --> 01:12:21,669
Hold it.

684
01:12:24,340 --> 01:12:25,381
Open the casket.

685
01:12:26,050 --> 01:12:30,094
- Who are you?
- I said, open the fucking casket.

686
01:12:39,563 --> 01:12:42,523
Bitch. Fuck.

687
01:13:15,724 --> 01:13:17,725
We shouldn't be here.

688
01:13:17,893 --> 01:13:19,644
Not if we wanna stay alive.

689
01:13:20,354 --> 01:13:21,771
Is it worth it?

690
01:13:22,606 --> 01:13:24,357
I think so.

691
01:13:28,195 --> 01:13:29,695
I hope so.

692
01:13:52,261 --> 01:13:54,011
Let me see this beautiful face.

693
01:16:12,401 --> 01:16:15,486
- Why'd you leave me to think I killed you?
- It was the only way...

694
01:16:15,654 --> 01:16:18,781
...I could get Tomas's men off my back.
- Wanna give me details?

695
01:16:18,949 --> 01:16:22,910
Poor lady OD'd in the emergency room.

696
01:16:24,204 --> 01:16:28,207
So I dropped my wallet in her purse
and here I am.

697
01:16:30,127 --> 01:16:32,837
That's pretty good, especially...

698
01:16:33,005 --> 01:16:35,339
...if you're an amateur.

699
01:16:37,718 --> 01:16:39,969
You could've been killed.

700
01:16:40,554 --> 01:16:42,930
I had to be there when he died.

701
01:16:43,098 --> 01:16:44,640
I needed to see it.

702
01:16:48,186 --> 01:16:50,187
Anyway...

703
01:16:51,898 --> 01:16:55,151
...I knew you'd pick
the safest route for everybody.

704
01:16:55,569 --> 01:16:57,820
I've studied your style.

705
01:16:59,197 --> 01:17:01,699
I know you always focused
your detonation.

706
01:17:06,121 --> 01:17:07,997
So I knew...

707
01:17:08,165 --> 01:17:13,711
...that if I was facing Tomas,
right in front of him, like this...

708
01:17:14,504 --> 01:17:17,256
A little bit closer, like this...

709
01:17:20,927 --> 01:17:23,596
...I knew I'd feel safe.

710
01:17:32,689 --> 01:17:35,608
Ahem. Excuse me.
Police are looking for these two people.

711
01:17:36,902 --> 01:17:39,820
If you happen to see them,
call the number on the back, okay?

712
01:17:40,656 --> 01:17:41,906
Hey, wait.

713
01:17:42,074 --> 01:17:44,241
I have seen them.

714
01:17:44,993 --> 01:17:46,661
May?

715
01:17:49,373 --> 01:18:27,868
May?

716
01:18:29,621 --> 01:18:30,788
- Back from the dead.
- Ned.

717
01:18:32,165 --> 01:18:34,709
Jesus. Thank God.

718
01:18:34,876 --> 01:18:37,420
You know, I was just going to call you.

719
01:18:37,587 --> 01:18:40,798
About the funeral thing,
look, I'm sorry, there's just...

720
01:18:40,966 --> 01:18:43,384
You know,
it was the only way to really draw him out.

721
01:18:43,552 --> 01:18:48,806
It worked. I don't have to tell you.
I used the attachment thing and I got him.

722
01:18:48,974 --> 01:18:51,809
Couldn't stay away from me. So?

723
01:18:51,977 --> 01:18:54,061
I just wanna get
one thing straight here, May.

724
01:18:54,229 --> 01:18:58,107
- Yeah.
- You did all this to deliver him to me?

725
01:19:00,026 --> 01:19:02,862
Ned, we had a deal.
I hold up my end of a deal.

726
01:19:03,363 --> 01:19:05,322
You're a classic, May.

727
01:19:05,490 --> 01:19:07,241
- Now, where is he?
- He's here.

728
01:19:07,409 --> 01:19:08,743
- Where?
- He's in the hotel.

729
01:19:08,910 --> 01:19:12,455
- I know he's in the hotel. Where? Uh-uh-uh.
- Well, I got a key. I think it...

730
01:19:12,622 --> 01:19:15,124
- This key?
- No, no, no.

731
01:19:15,292 --> 01:19:17,752
Yeah. This key?

732
01:19:17,919 --> 01:19:20,296
God, look, I mean, I do have a key.

733
01:19:20,464 --> 01:19:21,714
Ned, he's on a high floor.

734
01:19:21,882 --> 01:19:24,383
- I think it's 10 or it's 11.
- Take her to the car.

735
01:19:24,551 --> 01:19:26,719
- Go on.
- I left my purse in the room, Ned.

736
01:19:26,887 --> 01:19:30,222
- Shut up. Take her to the car.
- Ned, I have a couple of things I have...

737
01:19:30,390 --> 01:19:34,310
Stop yanking me around.
All right, all right.

738
01:19:35,395 --> 01:19:37,855
Oh, Harry, you've gotta be kidding.

739
01:19:38,023 --> 01:19:40,191
You're so adorable. No.

740
01:19:40,358 --> 01:19:43,444
He made me so nervous.
Look, it'll take me one second.

741
01:19:43,612 --> 01:19:45,571
Where can I go?

742
01:19:46,448 --> 01:19:48,073
Great.

743
01:19:51,870 --> 01:19:53,996
Harry, listen...

744
01:19:54,581 --> 01:19:57,875
- Harry, she'll call you back.
Hey.

745
01:19:58,293 --> 01:19:59,418
Give me my phone.

746
01:20:04,007 --> 01:20:05,257
Room 1205.

747
01:20:16,686 --> 01:20:19,605
- Yeah.
- Leon's men are on their way up.

748
01:20:20,065 --> 01:20:21,816
You set me up.

749
01:20:21,983 --> 01:20:23,317
- Why?
- I did not.

750
01:20:44,214 --> 01:20:48,425
NED: Come on, hit it. Okay, let's go, get out.
Come on, there's a fire. Let's go. Rush.

751
01:20:48,593 --> 01:20:50,052
Come on, come on.

752
01:20:50,220 --> 01:20:54,139
Where you going? Use the stairs. This
one's full. Get out of here. Get a new shirt.

753
01:21:34,806 --> 01:21:37,725
We're sorry.
Your call cannot be completed as dialed.

754
01:21:37,893 --> 01:21:42,730
Please check the number and dial again
or call your operator to help you.

755
01:21:49,195 --> 01:21:52,323
If you'd like to make a call,
please hang up and try again.

756
01:21:52,490 --> 01:21:55,910
If you need help,
hang up and then dial your operator.

757
01:22:06,171 --> 01:22:09,965
If you'd like to make a call,
please hang up and try again.

758
01:22:10,133 --> 01:22:13,844
If you need help,
hang up and then dial your operator.

759
01:22:14,179 --> 01:22:15,888
No!

760
01:22:24,564 --> 01:22:27,775
Don't move. Don't touch anything.

761
01:22:38,620 --> 01:22:40,537
Come on, give me your hand.

762
01:23:02,310 --> 01:23:03,394
Holy shit.

763
01:23:12,737 --> 01:23:14,905
Go! Go! Go!

764
01:23:24,249 --> 01:23:26,583
Hey, what's with the lights here?
He's in here.

765
01:23:26,751 --> 01:23:28,335
- Security, get him.
Hey!

766
01:23:29,462 --> 01:23:30,963
Hey!

767
01:23:34,551 --> 01:23:35,759
Oh.

768
01:24:00,452 --> 01:24:03,287
Come on, asshole. Come on.

769
01:24:31,733 --> 01:24:33,942
Please remain calm.

770
01:24:34,360 --> 01:24:36,945
There's no cause for alarm or panic.

771
01:24:37,113 --> 01:24:40,157
There has been an accident,
but there is currently no danger...

772
01:24:40,325 --> 01:24:43,494
...and no cause for alarm.

773
01:25:09,479 --> 01:25:11,188
That's her.

774
01:25:11,689 --> 01:25:14,650
Her who?
- That's the bitch that was banging Tomas.

775
01:25:14,818 --> 01:25:18,195
Her ID was faked.
Ray Quick is working for her.

776
01:25:22,450 --> 01:25:25,410
Alice and Stan Munro.

777
01:25:26,704 --> 01:25:28,247
What are you talking about?

778
01:25:29,249 --> 01:25:32,459
I was the kid your little boy missed
in the closet.

779
01:25:35,213 --> 01:25:36,797
Oh...

780
01:25:37,799 --> 01:25:40,676
- That was a long time ago.
- Not to me.

781
01:25:42,303 --> 01:25:44,138
Now I understand.

782
01:25:44,305 --> 01:25:46,431
Now I understand. You... Ha.

783
01:25:46,599 --> 01:25:48,767
You think...

784
01:25:48,935 --> 01:25:53,730
...that my son Tomas gave the orders
for the killings. Yeah? Well, you are wrong.

785
01:25:53,898 --> 01:25:59,236
If anybody in this house has power
to give orders, it's me.

786
01:25:59,404 --> 01:26:01,572
You understand? I give the orders.

787
01:26:01,739 --> 01:26:04,324
I give the orders of who is killed...

788
01:26:04,492 --> 01:26:09,079
...and who is not killed.
Is that understood?

789
01:26:09,247 --> 01:26:10,914
I need her, Joe...

790
01:26:11,082 --> 01:26:12,332
...to get to Ray.

791
01:26:12,500 --> 01:26:16,044
I have to make one more call,
then you can have her. But I need her now.

792
01:26:16,713 --> 01:26:18,338
You sure?

793
01:26:18,923 --> 01:26:20,299
Joe, please.

794
01:26:25,680 --> 01:26:27,806
Take the bitch.

795
01:26:46,159 --> 01:26:47,951
Show time.

796
01:26:50,455 --> 01:26:52,539
Hello?
- It's me.

797
01:26:52,957 --> 01:26:56,293
Look, I'm sorry. I didn't know
they were coming. You've gotta believe me.

798
01:26:56,461 --> 01:26:58,045
I'll tell you what I believe.

799
01:26:58,880 --> 01:27:00,464
I believe you're very good on the phone.

800
01:27:00,632 --> 01:27:02,424
Fuck.

801
01:27:02,967 --> 01:27:05,385
I need to see you.

802
01:27:05,720 --> 01:27:07,804
What, and me set up again?

803
01:27:07,972 --> 01:27:09,223
No, I'll pass.

804
01:27:10,475 --> 01:27:13,560
- I'm through taking risks.
- So that's it?

805
01:27:13,728 --> 01:27:16,563
We just walk away? Forever?

806
01:27:16,731 --> 01:27:19,107
It's safer for everybody.

807
01:27:21,986 --> 01:27:25,239
Come on, Ray, I don't know
what this relationship is about...

808
01:27:25,406 --> 01:27:28,116
...but there's one thing I know,
it's not based on safety.

809
01:27:28,284 --> 01:27:31,036
You're too much of an unknown.

810
01:27:31,204 --> 01:27:35,207
Adrian Hastings, May Munro.
Who the hell are you?

811
01:27:37,835 --> 01:27:40,963
- Do you remember the Fontainebleau?
- I remember.

812
01:27:43,508 --> 01:27:45,968
Do you remember touching me, Ray?

813
01:27:47,595 --> 01:27:49,805
Do you remember my voice?

814
01:27:50,598 --> 01:27:53,016
Not over the phone...

815
01:27:54,269 --> 01:27:56,520
...but carried on breath.

816
01:27:58,064 --> 01:27:59,106
On you.

817
01:28:00,733 --> 01:28:02,526
Near you.

818
01:28:04,779 --> 01:28:06,863
Close enough to feel.

819
01:28:07,031 --> 01:28:08,490
Why are you saying this to me?

820
01:28:10,201 --> 01:28:12,327
Because I have to.

821
01:28:14,038 --> 01:28:15,205
Come on, Ray.

822
01:28:16,749 --> 01:28:18,834
You gotta see me.

823
01:28:19,544 --> 01:28:20,585
Please?

824
01:28:22,046 --> 01:28:23,380
Please, baby?

825
01:28:33,558 --> 01:28:36,143
Double M Seafood, right now.

826
01:28:37,395 --> 01:28:39,896
All right. And Ray?

827
01:28:40,648 --> 01:28:41,982
I'm here.

828
01:28:42,150 --> 01:28:44,735
Do you remember the note
our relationship ended on?

829
01:28:45,611 --> 01:28:48,071
The last thing I said to you?

830
01:28:48,781 --> 01:28:49,906
I remember everything.

831
01:28:51,200 --> 01:28:52,242
I meant every word.

832
01:29:16,267 --> 01:29:17,559
You're going in alone, May.

833
01:29:18,269 --> 01:29:23,315
You know, if this is a trap,
I promise you, you're gonna die.

834
01:29:23,483 --> 01:29:24,900
But if he's in there...

835
01:29:25,068 --> 01:29:27,486
...I want you to make him
feel safe and secure.

836
01:29:28,154 --> 01:29:31,782
And I'll be listening on this microphone.

837
01:29:31,949 --> 01:29:34,951
The second I hear his voice, we move in.

838
01:29:35,370 --> 01:29:36,411
You understand?

839
01:29:36,746 --> 01:29:38,538
Now get out of the fucking car.

840
01:29:56,099 --> 01:30:00,060
This is all over, I could see us spending
some time together again.

841
01:30:00,645 --> 01:30:05,982
You know, you wash
the stink of Tomas and Ray off you...

842
01:30:06,442 --> 01:30:08,819
...you might clean up pretty good.

843
01:30:08,986 --> 01:30:10,654
Okay.

844
01:30:17,870 --> 01:30:19,204
Go ahead.

845
01:30:20,331 --> 01:30:22,833
And then you can go in
and get him yourself.

846
01:30:23,000 --> 01:30:24,668
I don't give a shit.

847
01:30:27,338 --> 01:30:29,297
Go on.

848
01:30:30,925 --> 01:30:32,008
Move.

849
01:30:40,810 --> 01:30:41,852
If she blinks...

850
01:30:42,812 --> 01:30:44,020
...kill her.

851
01:31:09,338 --> 01:31:11,548
Bad plan, Ned.

852
01:31:11,716 --> 01:31:13,633
That's it, boys, we got him. Move in.

853
01:31:37,492 --> 01:31:39,367
Go! Go, you chicken shits!

854
01:31:39,535 --> 01:31:42,871
What, you think he's gonna top that?
Get in there!

855
01:31:43,039 --> 01:31:45,916
Watch the river!
Watch the river and the side streets.

856
01:31:46,083 --> 01:31:48,001
Fucking crabs. Nice one, Raymond.

857
01:31:50,379 --> 01:31:51,963
Damn it.

858
01:31:53,090 --> 01:31:55,800
Assholes, watch the river.
Where are you, Raymond?

859
01:31:56,886 --> 01:31:59,179
All right, side one!

860
01:32:19,575 --> 01:32:21,952
What, and me set up again? No, I'll pass.

861
01:32:23,329 --> 01:32:24,538
What's that?

862
01:32:24,705 --> 01:32:26,540
Break it down.

863
01:32:28,960 --> 01:32:30,627
Air brakes.

864
01:32:30,795 --> 01:32:32,128
It's safer for everybody.

865
01:32:32,296 --> 01:32:34,839
Complex sound, slightly muffled.

866
01:32:35,007 --> 01:32:38,009
People talking, clamping down steps.

867
01:32:39,303 --> 01:32:40,637
A clapping shut.

868
01:32:41,347 --> 01:32:44,224
Voices, mechanical sounds.

869
01:32:44,392 --> 01:32:47,894
- A hiss.
- People getting off a bus. Yes. Yes.

870
01:32:48,062 --> 01:32:51,982
You have to have an overview. It's people
getting off a bus. Are these on both tapes?

871
01:32:52,149 --> 01:32:53,775
- Yes.
- Yes, I knew it. Okay, buses.

872
01:32:53,943 --> 01:32:56,653
We gotta have bus routes.
What do we have? Okay.

873
01:32:56,821 --> 01:33:00,574
He uses pay phones,
but he gets there by bus.

874
01:33:00,950 --> 01:33:03,326
Oh, Ray, you're always so precise.

875
01:33:03,494 --> 01:33:06,788
Let's say, he gets on a bus
wherever he lives and he...

876
01:33:06,956 --> 01:33:10,250
...goes in both directions. Right?
Good counter-surveillance technique.

877
01:33:10,418 --> 01:33:13,878
He takes the bus 20 to 25 minutes
in each direction. So we have...

878
01:33:14,213 --> 01:33:15,505
- Come on, come on.
Four.

879
01:33:15,673 --> 01:33:17,465
Four, four and four.

880
01:33:17,633 --> 01:33:19,551
Here we go, triangulation.

881
01:33:19,719 --> 01:33:23,930
Three routes, that's it. Bingo. Okay, we
wanna have checks in five-minute intervals.

882
01:33:24,098 --> 01:33:25,682
- Right?
- How about the restaurants?

883
01:33:25,850 --> 01:33:28,602
- Restaurants?
- He's gotta eat sometime.

884
01:33:29,604 --> 01:33:32,731
Try to remember. He would've gotten off
the bus, bought cigarettes.

885
01:33:32,898 --> 01:33:34,858
- Look at that face. Come on.
- I told you...

886
01:33:35,026 --> 01:33:37,444
...we have a lot of regular customers.
He ain't one.

887
01:33:37,612 --> 01:33:41,031
- Look at that face again. Come on.
- Nothing.

888
01:33:41,991 --> 01:33:43,116
Hey, Henry.

889
01:33:44,994 --> 01:33:47,537
I forgot to tell you, we deliver.

890
01:34:07,266 --> 01:34:09,059
Now, there's a vision.

891
01:34:14,398 --> 01:34:15,899
Good morning, stranger.

892
01:34:17,109 --> 01:34:18,818
I gotta go.

893
01:34:18,986 --> 01:34:22,197
Where? I think we already wore out
our welcome at the Hilton.

894
01:34:29,080 --> 01:34:30,830
I wanna stay with you.

895
01:34:32,458 --> 01:34:36,503
But it's not over for me.
Joe Leon ordered the hit.

896
01:34:37,546 --> 01:34:39,589
Let me get this right.

897
01:34:41,258 --> 01:34:44,302
You think that killing Joe Leon
is gonna make everything all right?

898
01:34:44,470 --> 01:34:46,429
Something has to.

899
01:34:48,766 --> 01:34:53,395
You did the job. I'm not asking
for your help. I'll take care of it. I owe him.

900
01:34:53,562 --> 01:34:55,021
No.

901
01:34:55,439 --> 01:34:56,981
You owe her.

902
01:35:00,111 --> 01:35:02,278
Her. A whole life. Come here.

903
01:35:04,240 --> 01:35:05,865
Come here.

904
01:35:13,999 --> 01:35:18,169
Put all this behind you now
or the past is gonna eat you alive.

905
01:35:18,337 --> 01:35:20,755
I know what I'm talking about.

906
01:35:24,510 --> 01:35:26,469
I have to go.

907
01:35:27,054 --> 01:35:28,638
Wish me luck.

908
01:35:28,806 --> 01:35:30,849
No.

909
01:35:39,734 --> 01:35:41,651
Come here. You're not going.

910
01:36:26,572 --> 01:36:29,741
Detonation sequence primed. Enter code.

911
01:36:29,909 --> 01:36:30,950
Top of the world, Mom.

912
01:36:32,870 --> 01:36:34,120
Controlled.

913
01:36:34,288 --> 01:36:35,622
One, two, three.

914
01:36:45,925 --> 01:36:47,300
I'm afraid to ask.

915
01:36:47,468 --> 01:36:50,929
This is rigged for controlled explosion
if the inner perimeter is breached.

916
01:36:51,096 --> 01:36:54,933
Each one of these lights is a pressure-mine
sequence. If one goes, they all go.

917
01:36:55,267 --> 01:36:56,559
- Where are they?
- Everywhere.

918
01:36:56,727 --> 01:37:00,438
But don't worry, they're not armed yet.
But if these lights turn red, worry.

919
01:37:10,282 --> 01:37:12,367
This is good. Nice sneak attack.

920
01:37:12,535 --> 01:37:16,746
Do not approach
the warehouse. Perimeter is armed.

921
01:37:16,914 --> 01:37:19,165
Please, cut the bullshit.

922
01:37:25,631 --> 01:37:27,841
That's a good one. I taught him that.

923
01:37:30,177 --> 01:37:32,929
Nice sense of irony,
blowing up the Bomb Disposal unit.

924
01:37:33,097 --> 01:37:34,180
Nice work, Ray.

925
01:37:35,599 --> 01:37:36,766
Warning.

926
01:37:36,934 --> 01:37:39,811
Gunfire will automatically
detonate B20s...

927
01:37:39,979 --> 01:37:42,981
...sufficient to destroy two square miles.

928
01:37:43,482 --> 01:37:45,275
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

929
01:37:45,818 --> 01:37:47,068
Go, go, go! To the left!

930
01:37:47,236 --> 01:37:48,945
Give me that.

931
01:37:50,698 --> 01:37:55,201
Listen up. Anybody shoots,
anybody shoots, and I shoot them.

932
01:37:56,245 --> 01:37:59,622
This whole place is wired
and I'm gonna take him alive. You got that?

933
01:38:05,129 --> 01:38:06,296
Move back!

934
01:38:06,463 --> 01:38:07,964
Look out.

935
01:38:09,550 --> 01:38:11,426
Air unit, stand by.

936
01:38:11,969 --> 01:38:13,136
Oh, that's new.

937
01:38:13,304 --> 01:38:15,179
How's that feel, ace?

938
01:38:16,307 --> 01:38:18,933
Don't shoot. Go.

939
01:38:19,310 --> 01:38:21,311
Fuck this amateur hour.

940
01:38:21,478 --> 01:38:24,439
Bravo Unit One, back up Three.
Sorry.

941
01:38:31,739 --> 01:38:33,072
You're crazy.

942
01:38:39,663 --> 01:38:42,665
All the highly trained professionals
in the world...

943
01:38:45,419 --> 01:38:47,921
...all the hardware...

944
01:38:48,088 --> 01:38:50,506
...all the technology
and what do you got?

945
01:38:51,508 --> 01:38:53,343
Nothing.

946
01:38:53,844 --> 01:38:56,012
You gotta do everything yourself.

947
01:38:57,264 --> 01:38:59,015
And why?

948
01:39:00,225 --> 01:39:02,894
You can't get good help these days.

949
01:39:04,188 --> 01:39:06,105
Side 5, report in.

950
01:39:07,775 --> 01:39:08,816
On command...

951
01:39:17,159 --> 01:39:20,203
Sir, we have a problem
with possible booby traps...

952
01:39:29,046 --> 01:39:31,422
A surprise for you, Ray.

953
01:39:34,635 --> 01:39:36,552
Inner perimeter breech, Ray.

954
01:39:37,054 --> 01:39:38,596
Right. It's set. Let's go.

955
01:39:44,395 --> 01:39:47,146
- Final destruction sequence initiated.
- Don't move.

956
01:39:47,314 --> 01:39:49,732
- I'll lead you through the pressure pads.
Evacuate.

957
01:39:49,900 --> 01:39:51,067
Ray?

958
01:39:53,404 --> 01:39:55,655
I'm sorry. Should I have knocked?

959
01:39:58,867 --> 01:40:00,159
All right, Ray.

960
01:40:01,495 --> 01:40:02,578
You lose, I win.

961
01:40:05,082 --> 01:40:08,668
Uh-uh. She's hot, Ray.
Semtex, sprayed with nitro.

962
01:40:09,086 --> 01:40:12,255
Cigarette case. Honest Injun, take a look.

963
01:40:12,423 --> 01:40:13,589
Ah!

964
01:40:13,757 --> 01:40:15,425
Just a peek, no touch.

965
01:40:21,015 --> 01:40:26,394
And May, you might ask yourself,
"Why is today my time to die?"

966
01:40:30,357 --> 01:40:33,109
Take it out. Slowly.

967
01:40:34,236 --> 01:40:36,112
Slowly.

968
01:40:37,614 --> 01:40:38,948
Open it up.

969
01:40:41,577 --> 01:40:44,203
Everybody deserves to die.

970
01:40:44,580 --> 01:40:48,374
Ask God. He kills across the board.

971
01:40:50,502 --> 01:40:52,128
So why shouldn't I?

972
01:40:53,672 --> 01:40:55,006
Bye.

973
01:40:56,425 --> 01:41:00,386
And here's a tip I learned from you, Ray.
It's a focused detonation. Only she blows.

974
01:41:00,554 --> 01:41:02,722
- It's pretty nifty, huh?
- Don't move it.

975
01:41:02,890 --> 01:41:05,683
The mercury switch.
Any change in attitude or altitude, it goes.

976
01:41:05,851 --> 01:41:07,643
Got it.

977
01:41:07,811 --> 01:41:09,937
Anyway, Ray, she's dead already.
What I need...

978
01:41:10,105 --> 01:41:13,566
...what I need is to take you alive
because, you see, my boss...

979
01:41:13,734 --> 01:41:15,902
...he wants to look in your eyes
when you die.

980
01:41:16,070 --> 01:41:18,071
- Okay?
- Sick fuck.

981
01:41:18,614 --> 01:41:19,947
I'm touched, really.

982
01:41:20,115 --> 01:41:21,616
What happened to us, Ray?

983
01:41:23,494 --> 01:41:25,119
We were...

984
01:41:26,121 --> 01:41:27,246
We were good together.

985
01:41:29,500 --> 01:41:31,793
You were the rigger and I was the trigger.

986
01:41:34,588 --> 01:41:37,006
You shouldn't have taken me down.

987
01:41:37,174 --> 01:41:39,759
Because now, you fuck.

988
01:41:42,471 --> 01:41:45,890
I see you're still into
the old memories, Ray.

989
01:41:46,975 --> 01:41:49,685
Well, that's what always does you in,
you know, memories.

990
01:41:49,853 --> 01:41:52,063
It's that trying to save the innocent.

991
01:41:53,148 --> 01:41:55,316
You know your problem, Ray?

992
01:41:56,443 --> 01:41:57,693
You're too sentimental.

993
01:41:57,861 --> 01:42:00,530
There's nothing wrong
with being sentimental.

994
01:42:01,532 --> 01:42:04,200
Sometimes you could save your ass.

995
01:42:07,704 --> 01:42:10,498
Fuck.
- Here's a tip: No fail-safe.

996
01:42:10,666 --> 01:42:11,958
Pressure pads.

997
01:42:19,591 --> 01:42:22,093
Thirty seconds to total destruction.

998
01:42:22,261 --> 01:42:26,013
All right. Now, slide it to me.

999
01:42:30,894 --> 01:42:33,187
Twenty-five seconds.

1000
01:42:33,355 --> 01:42:36,440
It's all right. Just do it, May.

1001
01:42:36,608 --> 01:42:38,151
Slide your hands out.

1002
01:42:39,736 --> 01:42:40,736
Twenty seconds.

1003
01:42:45,784 --> 01:42:48,536
Now get the hell out of here.
Straight down the right side.

1004
01:42:48,704 --> 01:42:50,746
Not without you.

1005
01:42:51,331 --> 01:42:53,833
- Fifteen seconds.
- I'm right behind you.

1006
01:42:58,797 --> 01:43:01,090
Ten seconds.

1007
01:43:04,428 --> 01:43:05,678
Oh, no!

1008
01:43:07,014 --> 01:43:09,557
- Five seconds.
Come on! Come on!

1009
01:43:11,768 --> 01:43:13,186
Three seconds.

1010
01:43:52,851 --> 01:43:54,185
Come on!

1011
01:44:35,018 --> 01:44:36,686
Thank you.

1012
01:44:46,863 --> 01:44:49,865
You are a kind God.

1013
01:44:51,034 --> 01:44:52,827
Thank you.

1014
01:45:18,061 --> 01:45:19,562
You bastarda!

1015
01:45:32,409 --> 01:45:35,244
- How do you feel?
- Better.
