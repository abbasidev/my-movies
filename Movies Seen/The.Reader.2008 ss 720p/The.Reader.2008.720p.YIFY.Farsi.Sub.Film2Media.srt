1
00:01:07,654 --> 00:01:09,654
You didn't wake me.

2
00:01:10,957 --> 00:01:12,620
You were sleeping.

3
00:01:12,625 --> 00:01:14,855
You can't bear
to have breakfast with me.

4
00:01:14,928 --> 00:01:16,326
I've boiled you an egg. See?

5
00:01:16,331 --> 00:01:18,192
I'd hardly have
boiled you an egg...

6
00:01:18,197 --> 00:01:21,963
if I didn't want to see you.
Um, tea or coffee?

7
00:01:22,035 --> 00:01:24,060
Does any woman
ever stay long enough...

8
00:01:24,137 --> 00:01:27,698
to find out what the hell
goes on in your head?

9
00:01:28,308 --> 00:01:30,435
What are you doing tonight?

10
00:01:30,510 --> 00:01:32,510
I'm seeing my daughter.

11
00:01:32,512 --> 00:01:33,601
Your daughter?

12
00:01:33,606 --> 00:01:36,175
You've kept very
quiet about her.

13
00:01:36,249 --> 00:01:38,376
Have I?

14
00:01:38,451 --> 00:01:41,852
Well, she's been
abroad for a year.

15
00:01:43,423 --> 00:01:45,423
Did you say tea?

16
00:01:45,858 --> 00:01:47,858
I'm going.

17
00:01:50,163 --> 00:01:52,163
Have fun with your daughter.

18
00:02:23,863 --> 00:02:25,863
Tickets, please.

19
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:31,216
Tickets.
Excuse me.

20
00:02:35,174 --> 00:02:37,174
Tickets.

21
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:42,680
Tickets, please.

22
00:03:40,773 --> 00:03:42,798
Oh.

23
00:03:42,875 --> 00:03:45,241
Hey. Hey, you.

24
00:04:12,605 --> 00:04:15,039
Your feet. Your feet.

25
00:04:33,893 --> 00:04:35,893
Hey, kid.

26
00:04:37,296 --> 00:04:39,296
Up.

27
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:43,100
It's all right.

28
00:04:52,345 --> 00:04:55,678
There. Where do you live?

29
00:05:00,987 --> 00:05:05,083
It's just up here.
I'll be fine now. Thank you.

30
00:05:06,926 --> 00:05:08,926
Goodbye.

31
00:05:17,303 --> 00:05:19,303
Look after yourself.

32
00:05:24,811 --> 00:05:28,679
I'm worried about him.
He looks terrible.

33
00:05:28,748 --> 00:05:31,182
The boy's saying
he doesn't need a doctor.

34
00:05:31,250 --> 00:05:33,214
- He does.
- I don't need a doctor.

35
00:05:33,219 --> 00:05:35,551
- Good, then.
- Peter.

36
00:05:35,621 --> 00:05:38,988
We're not going to
argue about this.

37
00:05:40,293 --> 00:05:43,490
Remind me.
How old are you, now?

38
00:05:43,563 --> 00:05:45,326
Michael's 15.

39
00:05:45,331 --> 00:05:48,164
It's scarlet fever.

40
00:05:48,234 --> 00:05:51,169
He'll be in bed
for several months, at least.

41
00:05:51,237 --> 00:05:53,797
Complete isolation.

42
00:05:53,873 --> 00:05:57,104
Emily, keep away.
He's contagious.

43
00:05:59,078 --> 00:06:01,078
Emily.

44
00:06:17,330 --> 00:06:19,457
How are you feeling?

45
00:06:20,399 --> 00:06:22,399
Better.

46
00:06:23,402 --> 00:06:25,402
I meant to tell you...

47
00:06:25,605 --> 00:06:27,630
...the day I got ill,
a woman helped me.

48
00:06:27,707 --> 00:06:29,637
She helped you?

49
00:06:29,642 --> 00:06:32,042
Yes. She brought me home.

50
00:06:33,112 --> 00:06:35,112
Do you have her address?

51
00:07:10,683 --> 00:07:13,709
- Hello?
- Yes?

52
00:07:39,445 --> 00:07:42,778
I brought you these flowers
to say thank you.

53
00:07:42,848 --> 00:07:45,078
Put them over
there in the sink.

54
00:08:06,005 --> 00:08:09,133
I would have come earlier,
I've been in bed three months.

55
00:08:09,208 --> 00:08:13,440
- You are better now?
- Yes. Thank you.

56
00:08:13,512 --> 00:08:15,899
- Have you always been weak?

57
00:08:15,904 --> 00:08:18,973
Oh, no. I've never
been sick before.

58
00:08:19,051 --> 00:08:23,283
It's incredibly boring.
There's nothing to do.

59
00:08:23,789 --> 00:08:25,789
I couldn't even be
bothered to read.

60
00:08:30,563 --> 00:08:32,827
Well, thank you again.

61
00:08:34,433 --> 00:08:36,492
Wait.

62
00:08:36,569 --> 00:08:38,867
I'll walk with you.
I have to go to work.

63
00:08:42,742 --> 00:08:45,176
Wait in the hall
while I change.

64
00:11:33,913 --> 00:11:36,006
There are two more
buckets downstairs.

65
00:11:36,081 --> 00:11:38,447
You can fill them
and bring them up.

66
00:12:05,811 --> 00:12:08,939
You look ridiculous.
Look at you, kid.

67
00:12:12,017 --> 00:12:14,349
You can't go home like that.

68
00:12:18,257 --> 00:12:21,818
Take off your clothes.
I'll run you a bath.

69
00:12:42,548 --> 00:12:45,346
Do you always take
a bath in your trousers?

70
00:12:58,697 --> 00:13:01,165
It's all right. I won't look.

71
00:14:08,067 --> 00:14:10,067
I'll get you a towel.

72
00:15:10,896 --> 00:15:13,490
So that's why you came back.

73
00:15:31,016 --> 00:15:33,143
You're so beautiful.

74
00:15:34,853 --> 00:15:37,344
What are you talking about?

75
00:15:46,732 --> 00:15:48,757
Look at me, kid.

76
00:15:50,702 --> 00:15:52,566
Mm. Mm.

77
00:15:52,571 --> 00:15:54,630
Slowly.

78
00:15:54,706 --> 00:15:56,936
Slowly...

79
00:15:57,009 --> 00:15:59,009
Shh.

80
00:16:34,046 --> 00:16:36,046
You've inconvenienced
your mother.

81
00:16:36,114 --> 00:16:40,141
How many more times?
I've said I'm sorry.

82
00:16:40,219 --> 00:16:42,449
- You scared her.
- I got lost, that's all.

83
00:16:42,521 --> 00:16:44,853
That's why I was late.
Can I have some more?

84
00:16:44,923 --> 00:16:47,357
How can anyone get lost
in their own hometown?

85
00:16:47,426 --> 00:16:49,129
I meant to head
for the castle.

86
00:16:49,134 --> 00:16:50,524
I ended up at the field.

87
00:16:50,529 --> 00:16:52,559
- Opposite directions.
- None of your business.

88
00:16:52,564 --> 00:16:56,364
- He's lying.
- He's not lying.

89
00:16:56,435 --> 00:16:58,435
Michael never lies.

90
00:17:01,807 --> 00:17:04,401
I've decided I want
to go back to school tomorrow.

91
00:17:04,476 --> 00:17:06,668
- The doctor says
you need three weeks.

92
00:17:06,673 --> 00:17:07,741
Well, I'm going.

93
00:17:07,746 --> 00:17:10,237
Peter?

94
00:17:22,828 --> 00:17:25,228
- Hey.
- Ooh.

95
00:17:51,657 --> 00:17:54,922
Like this?

96
00:17:54,993 --> 00:17:57,018
That's right.

97
00:18:01,633 --> 00:18:04,193
No, not so fast.

98
00:18:14,613 --> 00:18:16,613
Ah.

99
00:18:19,051 --> 00:18:21,576
It's all right.

100
00:18:21,653 --> 00:18:23,653
Do it again.

101
00:18:26,224 --> 00:18:28,488
Mm...

102
00:18:29,962 --> 00:18:31,962
Oh.

103
00:18:46,578 --> 00:18:49,411
What's your name?

104
00:18:49,481 --> 00:18:52,279
- What?
- Your name.

105
00:18:52,351 --> 00:18:57,584
- Why do you want to know?
- I've been here three times.

106
00:18:57,656 --> 00:19:02,559
I want to know your name.
What's wrong with that?

107
00:19:02,628 --> 00:19:04,755
Nothing, kid.

108
00:19:04,830 --> 00:19:07,890
There's nothing
wrong with that.

109
00:19:07,966 --> 00:19:10,867
- It's Hanna.
- You look so suspicious.

110
00:19:13,939 --> 00:19:17,136
- What's yours, kid?
- Michael.

111
00:19:17,209 --> 00:19:20,701
Michael. Hmm.

112
00:19:20,779 --> 00:19:23,009
So I'm with a Michael.

113
00:19:24,816 --> 00:19:26,413
Hanna.

114
00:19:26,418 --> 00:19:28,494
The notion of secrecy...

115
00:19:28,499 --> 00:19:31,355
is central to
Western literature.

116
00:19:32,658 --> 00:19:36,059
You may say the whole
idea of character...

117
00:19:36,128 --> 00:19:39,393
is defined by people...

118
00:19:39,464 --> 00:19:42,228
holding specific information,

119
00:19:42,300 --> 00:19:44,962
which, for various reasons,

120
00:19:45,037 --> 00:19:48,939
sometimes perverse,
sometimes noble,

121
00:19:49,007 --> 00:19:52,408
they are determined
not to disclose.

122
00:20:05,023 --> 00:20:08,789
You never tell me
what you've been studying.

123
00:20:08,860 --> 00:20:10,860
Studying?

124
00:20:12,130 --> 00:20:14,130
At school.

125
00:20:17,335 --> 00:20:21,465
- Do you learn languages?
- Yes.

126
00:20:22,641 --> 00:20:26,475
- What languages?
- Latin.

127
00:20:30,415 --> 00:20:34,442
Say something in Latin.

128
00:20:40,292 --> 00:20:42,624
It's Horace.

129
00:20:42,694 --> 00:20:45,060
It's wonderful.

130
00:20:46,298 --> 00:20:48,298
Do you want some Greek?

131
00:21:07,018 --> 00:21:09,418
It's beautiful.

132
00:21:09,488 --> 00:21:12,013
How can you tell?

133
00:21:12,090 --> 00:21:13,165
How do you know,

134
00:21:13,170 --> 00:21:15,457
when you've no idea
what it means?

135
00:21:18,864 --> 00:21:20,889
What are you
studying in German?

136
00:21:20,966 --> 00:21:22,966
I'm studying a play.

137
00:21:24,770 --> 00:21:26,228
By a writer called Gotthold

138
00:21:26,233 --> 00:21:28,135
Ephraim Lessing.
You heard of him?

139
00:21:28,140 --> 00:21:31,233
The play's called
Emilia Galotti.

140
00:21:31,238 --> 00:21:32,806
You can read it.

141
00:21:32,811 --> 00:21:35,405
I'd rather listen to you.

142
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:37,480
All right.

143
00:21:47,125 --> 00:21:49,491
'Act One. Scene One.

144
00:21:49,561 --> 00:21:52,792
The setting:
one of the prince's chambers.

145
00:21:52,864 --> 00:21:55,424
The Prince...'

146
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:58,196
I'm not very good.

147
00:21:58,270 --> 00:22:00,270
Go on.

148
00:22:01,540 --> 00:22:05,442
'Complaints, nothing
but complaints.

149
00:22:05,510 --> 00:22:07,293
For goodness sake,

150
00:22:07,298 --> 00:22:10,470
is there anything
left but work?

151
00:22:10,549 --> 00:22:13,814
Just imagine that
people actually envy us.'

152
00:22:15,620 --> 00:22:17,850
You're good at it, aren't you?

153
00:22:20,192 --> 00:22:22,422
Good at what?

154
00:22:25,864 --> 00:22:27,864
Reading.

155
00:22:31,570 --> 00:22:33,570
What's funny?

156
00:22:35,574 --> 00:22:37,574
I didn't think I was
good at anything.

157
00:22:50,255 --> 00:22:52,255
Whoo.

158
00:24:05,530 --> 00:24:08,693
What are you doing?
What is this?

159
00:24:08,767 --> 00:24:10,997
Why did you behave
as if you didn't know me?

160
00:24:11,069 --> 00:24:13,266
You didn't want to
know me. You could...

161
00:24:13,271 --> 00:24:15,101
see I was in the
first carriage.

162
00:24:15,106 --> 00:24:16,926
- So why did you
sit in the second?

163
00:24:16,931 --> 00:24:18,605
What did you
think I was doing?

164
00:24:18,610 --> 00:24:20,289
- Why did you
think I was there?

165
00:24:20,294 --> 00:24:21,308
How should I know?

166
00:24:21,313 --> 00:24:25,044
Now, I've been working.
I need a bath.

167
00:24:25,116 --> 00:24:27,414
And I'd like to be by myself.

168
00:24:27,485 --> 00:24:29,485
Would you please leave?.

169
00:24:33,925 --> 00:24:36,860
I... I didn't mean
to upset you.

170
00:24:39,130 --> 00:24:42,395
You don't have the
power to upset me.

171
00:24:42,467 --> 00:24:44,560
You don't matter
enough to upset me.

172
00:26:02,247 --> 00:26:04,247
I don't know what to say.

173
00:26:06,618 --> 00:26:08,813
I've never been with
a woman before.

174
00:26:12,957 --> 00:26:15,858
We've been together
four weeks,

175
00:26:15,927 --> 00:26:18,452
and I can't live without you.

176
00:26:18,530 --> 00:26:20,896
I can't.

177
00:26:20,965 --> 00:26:23,229
Even the thought
of it kills me.

178
00:26:29,374 --> 00:26:30,929
I sat in the second carriage...

179
00:26:30,934 --> 00:26:32,934
because I thought
you might kiss me.

180
00:26:34,145 --> 00:26:37,080
Kid, you thought
we could make love in a tram?

181
00:26:42,887 --> 00:26:45,412
Is it true what you said?

182
00:26:45,490 --> 00:26:47,490
That I don't matter to you?

183
00:27:00,638 --> 00:27:02,765
Do you forgive me?

184
00:27:08,746 --> 00:27:10,746
Do you love me?

185
00:27:27,899 --> 00:27:32,063
- Do you have a book?
- Yes, I have.

186
00:27:32,137 --> 00:27:34,137
I took one with
me this morning.

187
00:27:35,607 --> 00:27:38,804
- What is it?
- The Odyssey, by Homer.

188
00:27:38,877 --> 00:27:40,877
It's my homework.

189
00:27:43,548 --> 00:27:45,982
We're changing the
order we do things.

190
00:27:46,050 --> 00:27:49,884
Read to me first, kid.
Then we make love.

191
00:27:55,493 --> 00:27:59,395
- The Odyssey, by Homer.
- What's an odyssey?

192
00:27:59,464 --> 00:28:01,464
A journey.
He sets out on a journey.

193
00:28:02,267 --> 00:28:04,267
Good.

194
00:28:07,672 --> 00:28:11,506
'Sing to me of the man, Muse
The man of twists and turns

195
00:28:11,576 --> 00:28:13,439
Driven time and
again off course

196
00:28:13,444 --> 00:28:14,908
Once he had plundered...

197
00:28:14,913 --> 00:28:16,877
- The hallowed
heights of Troy'

198
00:28:16,882 --> 00:28:18,882
Come here.

199
00:28:25,390 --> 00:28:27,881
'He pressed
her hand to his lips.

200
00:28:29,027 --> 00:28:31,587
She was dead.

201
00:28:31,663 --> 00:28:35,030
Past all help, or need of it.'

202
00:28:42,707 --> 00:28:44,213
'I poked into the place a...

203
00:28:44,218 --> 00:28:46,370
ways, encountered a
little open patch...

204
00:28:46,444 --> 00:28:49,936
as big as a bedroom,
all hung around with vines,

205
00:28:50,014 --> 00:28:51,978
and found a man
lying there asleep.

206
00:28:51,983 --> 00:28:56,352
And, by jings, it
was my old Jim.

207
00:28:56,421 --> 00:28:57,468
'When you landed,

208
00:28:57,473 --> 00:28:59,879
I reckoned I could
catch up with you...

209
00:28:59,958 --> 00:29:01,961
on the land without
having to shout...

210
00:29:01,966 --> 00:29:03,823
at you. But when
I see that house.

211
00:29:03,828 --> 00:29:05,692
I begin to go slow.''

212
00:29:05,697 --> 00:29:07,360
'Lady Chatterley...

213
00:29:07,365 --> 00:29:10,430
felt his naked
flesh against her...

214
00:29:10,501 --> 00:29:13,732
as he came into her.

215
00:29:13,805 --> 00:29:16,069
For a moment,
he was still inside her...'

216
00:29:16,140 --> 00:29:18,140
This is disgusting.

217
00:29:19,711 --> 00:29:21,906
Where did you get this?

218
00:29:21,980 --> 00:29:23,842
- I borrowed it from
someone at school.

219
00:29:23,847 --> 00:29:24,911
Oh...

220
00:29:24,916 --> 00:29:26,916
You should be ashamed.

221
00:29:30,288 --> 00:29:32,288
Go on.

222
00:29:33,091 --> 00:29:35,284
'Billions of bilious
blue blistering...

223
00:29:35,289 --> 00:29:37,223
barnacles in a
thundering typhoon.

224
00:29:37,228 --> 00:29:39,269
It is water.' 'But
what on earth...

225
00:29:39,274 --> 00:29:40,860
did you expect it to be?'

226
00:29:40,865 --> 00:29:41,878
- Whiskey.

227
00:29:41,883 --> 00:29:45,131
'Whiskey, by
thunder, whiskey.'

228
00:29:45,203 --> 00:29:48,661
'Whiskey? Come now, captain,
you can't be serious.''

229
00:29:48,740 --> 00:29:51,868
That's enough for today, kid.

230
00:29:51,943 --> 00:29:55,709
I was wondering, do you think
you could get some time off?

231
00:29:55,780 --> 00:29:58,305
Maybe we could go on a trip.

232
00:29:58,383 --> 00:30:01,580
- What sort of trip?
- A cycling holiday.

233
00:30:01,653 --> 00:30:03,653
Just two days.

234
00:30:07,792 --> 00:30:10,625
I've got a guide book.
I've worked out the route.

235
00:30:10,695 --> 00:30:14,290
Look. What do you think?

236
00:30:17,769 --> 00:30:20,169
I think you like
planning, don't you?

237
00:30:36,454 --> 00:30:39,218
'I'm not frightened.

238
00:30:39,290 --> 00:30:41,290
I'm not frightened
of anything.

239
00:30:43,061 --> 00:30:47,964
The more I suffer,
the more I love.

240
00:30:48,032 --> 00:30:50,796
Danger will only
increase my love.

241
00:30:50,868 --> 00:30:54,360
It will sharpen it.
It will give it spice.

242
00:30:56,207 --> 00:30:58,207
I'll be the only
angel you need.

243
00:30:58,910 --> 00:31:01,551
You will leave life
even more beautiful...

244
00:31:01,556 --> 00:31:02,875
than you entered it.

245
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:06,577
Heaven will take you back
and look at you and say,

246
00:31:06,651 --> 00:31:09,507
'Only one thing
can make a soul...

247
00:31:09,512 --> 00:31:12,453
complete, and that
thing is love.'

248
00:31:38,683 --> 00:31:40,776
- Hello.
- Hello.

249
00:31:47,558 --> 00:31:49,651
- Excuse me.
- Hello.

250
00:31:50,762 --> 00:31:52,855
Do you know what you'd like?

251
00:31:55,433 --> 00:31:58,425
- Um...
- What are you having?

252
00:31:58,503 --> 00:32:01,400
- You order. I'll
have what you have.

253
00:32:01,405 --> 00:32:02,468
OK.

254
00:32:02,473 --> 00:32:04,203
Um...

255
00:32:04,208 --> 00:32:07,311
Two frankfurters,
two potato salads...

256
00:32:07,316 --> 00:32:09,316
and two beers, please.

257
00:32:18,356 --> 00:32:20,319
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

258
00:32:20,324 --> 00:32:22,618
- I hope your
mother was happy.

259
00:32:22,623 --> 00:32:23,689
Thank you.

260
00:32:23,694 --> 00:32:25,889
She enjoyed her
meal very much.

261
00:32:41,379 --> 00:32:43,379
Come on.

262
00:32:59,197 --> 00:33:03,031
Here, let me show you
where we're going.

263
00:33:03,100 --> 00:33:05,898
It's OK, kid.

264
00:33:05,970 --> 00:33:08,530
I don't want to know.

265
00:34:58,816 --> 00:35:00,420
- What are you doing?

266
00:35:00,425 --> 00:35:02,718
I'm writing a poem. About you.

267
00:35:05,756 --> 00:35:08,623
- Can I hear it?
- It's not ready.

268
00:35:09,627 --> 00:35:11,627
I'll read it to you one day.

269
00:36:27,705 --> 00:36:30,173
- Morning, Hendrick.
- Good morning, Mr. Berg.

270
00:36:30,241 --> 00:36:32,573
- You're in court 306.
- Thank you.

271
00:36:32,643 --> 00:36:34,540
- You all right, Michael?
- I'm fine.

272
00:36:34,545 --> 00:36:36,566
- Hurry. You know
what she's like.

273
00:36:36,571 --> 00:36:37,643
See you later.

274
00:36:37,648 --> 00:36:39,648
Good luck.

275
00:36:40,885 --> 00:36:42,885
Please stand.

276
00:36:47,258 --> 00:36:49,258
Please sit down.

277
00:36:53,097 --> 00:36:55,725
The defendant, please.

278
00:37:06,644 --> 00:37:08,644
They're coming.

279
00:37:13,217 --> 00:37:16,880
- Hello.
- Hello.

280
00:37:16,954 --> 00:37:19,718
- What did she say?
- Good morning, ladies.

281
00:37:19,790 --> 00:37:22,157
Welcome your new
fellow-students.

282
00:37:22,162 --> 00:37:24,023
Treat them with courtesy.

283
00:37:24,028 --> 00:37:26,724
- Sit down.
- Hello.

284
00:37:28,165 --> 00:37:31,396
- My name's Sophie.
- I'm Michael.

285
00:37:31,469 --> 00:37:33,469
The Odyssey.

286
00:37:33,504 --> 00:37:35,504
Take our your books.

287
00:37:38,542 --> 00:37:41,477
Everyone believes
Homer's subject is homecoming.

288
00:37:41,545 --> 00:37:44,537
In fact, The Odyssey
is a book about a journey.

289
00:37:44,615 --> 00:37:47,448
Home is a place you dream of.

290
00:37:47,518 --> 00:37:49,621
Berg, I don't mean to
distract you, but...

291
00:37:49,626 --> 00:37:51,626
we're meant to study
Homer, not Sophie.

292
00:38:00,598 --> 00:38:02,930
- It's wonderful, isn't it?
- Wonderful.

293
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,000
It's gonna be a great summer.

294
00:38:18,649 --> 00:38:21,516
- Why do you leave early?
- He always leaves early.

295
00:38:21,585 --> 00:38:24,816
- Do you have somewhere to go?
- See you tomorrow.

296
00:38:33,297 --> 00:38:35,356
Sorry I'm late.

297
00:38:37,468 --> 00:38:39,468
I got held up at school.

298
00:38:41,438 --> 00:38:43,235
I have a new book.

299
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:46,403
The Lady with a Little Dog.

300
00:38:49,013 --> 00:38:50,342
By Anton Chekhov.

301
00:38:50,347 --> 00:38:53,646
'The talk was that a new face
had appeared on the promenade,

302
00:38:53,717 --> 00:38:55,878
a lady with a little dog.'

303
00:39:08,566 --> 00:39:11,091
Schmitz, one moment, please.

304
00:39:12,469 --> 00:39:14,301
I read the reports on you.

305
00:39:14,306 --> 00:39:16,633
Every single one.
Excellent work.

306
00:39:16,707 --> 00:39:19,301
You'll be working
in the office.

307
00:39:19,376 --> 00:39:22,743
You got promoted.
Congratulations.

308
00:39:29,954 --> 00:39:33,913
- Yee-haw.
- Ah.

309
00:39:33,991 --> 00:39:36,186
Let's get out of here.

310
00:39:36,260 --> 00:39:38,588
Come on. Michael,
we're leaving.

311
00:39:38,593 --> 00:39:39,658
Let's go.

312
00:39:39,663 --> 00:39:40,860
Come on, Michael.

313
00:39:40,865 --> 00:39:43,891
It's meant to be a surprise
for your birthday.

314
00:39:47,471 --> 00:39:49,666
- Come on.
- What's the matter?

315
00:39:49,740 --> 00:39:52,903
- I'm sorry. Really.
- We thought you'd like it.

316
00:39:52,977 --> 00:39:55,172
We've got beer.
We're gonna dance.

317
00:39:56,146 --> 00:39:58,146
I promised someone.

318
00:39:58,382 --> 00:40:00,382
Michael, please.

319
00:40:05,489 --> 00:40:09,152
'Here and there the reflection
of the stars and the lights,

320
00:40:09,226 --> 00:40:11,626
on the bank quivered
and trembled.'

321
00:40:11,695 --> 00:40:14,391
- Oh, kid, kid.
- What?

322
00:40:14,465 --> 00:40:17,366
- Stop.
- What's wrong now?

323
00:40:17,434 --> 00:40:19,959
Nothing's wrong.

324
00:40:22,539 --> 00:40:24,539
It's nothing.

325
00:40:26,410 --> 00:40:29,811
You know, you never ask.

326
00:40:30,481 --> 00:40:33,473
You never bother
to ask how I am.

327
00:40:33,550 --> 00:40:35,550
You never say.

328
00:40:36,520 --> 00:40:38,520
It just happens to
be my birthday.

329
00:40:40,190 --> 00:40:42,920
It's my birthday, that's all.

330
00:40:42,993 --> 00:40:44,957
You've never
even asked when it is.

331
00:40:44,962 --> 00:40:47,658
- If you want a fight, kid...
- I don't want a fight.

332
00:40:47,731 --> 00:40:49,363
- What's wrong with you?.

333
00:40:49,368 --> 00:40:51,368
What business is it of yours?.

334
00:40:51,402 --> 00:40:54,769
It's always on your terms.
Everything.

335
00:40:54,838 --> 00:40:57,568
We do what you want.
It's always what you want.

336
00:40:57,641 --> 00:40:59,539
- My friends were
giving me a party.

337
00:40:59,544 --> 00:41:00,506
Why are you here?

338
00:41:00,511 --> 00:41:04,174
Go back to your party.
Is that what you want?

339
00:41:06,517 --> 00:41:08,712
Mm. Mm.

340
00:41:29,840 --> 00:41:31,840
It's always me
that has to apologize.

341
00:41:31,875 --> 00:41:36,175
You don't have to apologize.
No one has to apologize.

342
00:41:44,888 --> 00:41:46,888
War and Peace, kid.

343
00:43:31,995 --> 00:43:34,225
Now, you must go
back to your friends.

344
00:43:50,414 --> 00:43:52,414
Are you all right?

345
00:45:22,573 --> 00:45:24,573
It's him.

346
00:45:27,844 --> 00:45:30,005
Good.

347
00:45:30,080 --> 00:45:32,378
Get the boy something to eat.

348
00:45:41,391 --> 00:45:44,952
I think we all knew you'd
come back to us eventually.

349
00:46:54,064 --> 00:46:57,227
Mr. Berg? It is 8:00.

350
00:46:57,301 --> 00:46:59,301
Your daughter.

351
00:47:01,705 --> 00:47:03,832
Thank you.

352
00:47:06,476 --> 00:47:08,476
Julia.

353
00:47:10,414 --> 00:47:13,474
- I've not kept you waiting?
- I was early.

354
00:47:13,550 --> 00:47:15,780
Welcome back.

355
00:47:18,522 --> 00:47:21,650
So how will you decide?

356
00:47:21,725 --> 00:47:24,558
I don't know.

357
00:47:24,628 --> 00:47:26,591
I'm happy back in
Berlin, I suppose.

358
00:47:26,596 --> 00:47:28,757
- You've seen your mother?
- Mm-hmm.

359
00:47:28,832 --> 00:47:31,460
I wanted to get
away. That's all.

360
00:47:31,535 --> 00:47:32,236
It was Paris,

361
00:47:32,241 --> 00:47:34,032
but it could have
been anywhere.

362
00:47:34,037 --> 00:47:36,505
Away from your parents?

363
00:47:38,375 --> 00:47:40,809
I'm aware I was difficult.

364
00:47:42,646 --> 00:47:44,646
I wasn't always open with you.

365
00:47:48,018 --> 00:47:50,316
I'm not open with anyone.

366
00:47:56,827 --> 00:47:58,827
I knew you were distant.

367
00:48:00,263 --> 00:48:01,495
You know...

368
00:48:01,500 --> 00:48:05,200
I always assumed
it was my fault.

369
00:48:06,269 --> 00:48:09,067
Julia.

370
00:48:09,139 --> 00:48:11,139
How wrong can you be?

371
00:48:22,619 --> 00:48:25,520
- I'll see you very soon.
- See you soon.

372
00:48:28,258 --> 00:48:30,818
- Good night, Dad.
- Good night.

373
00:48:38,568 --> 00:48:41,196
Those of you
for the special seminar group,

374
00:48:41,271 --> 00:48:43,402
please stay on in this room.

375
00:48:43,473 --> 00:48:46,237
Professor Rohl will
be here in a moment.

376
00:49:16,907 --> 00:49:21,776
Well, we seem
to be quite a small group.

377
00:49:21,845 --> 00:49:25,576
A small group
and a select one.

378
00:49:25,649 --> 00:49:28,982
Clearly, this is going
to be a unique seminar.

379
00:49:29,052 --> 00:49:31,025
We are going to start...

380
00:49:31,030 --> 00:49:33,580
with a reading
list, gentlemen.

381
00:49:33,657 --> 00:49:36,182
Karl Jaspers...

382
00:49:36,259 --> 00:49:37,472
- And ladies.

383
00:49:37,477 --> 00:49:40,559
...The Question
of German Guilt.

384
00:49:57,113 --> 00:50:00,105
So this is where you are.

385
00:50:00,183 --> 00:50:02,183
Yes.

386
00:50:03,520 --> 00:50:05,520
Come in.

387
00:50:07,090 --> 00:50:10,821
- You take work seriously.
- I don't know.

388
00:50:10,894 --> 00:50:13,328
You're rather a serious boy.

389
00:50:13,396 --> 00:50:15,489
It's how I was brought up.

390
00:50:17,067 --> 00:50:20,161
What about you?
Are you serious?

391
00:50:23,039 --> 00:50:25,507
You're sure you want
to work tonight?

392
00:50:27,043 --> 00:50:29,043
Yeah.

393
00:50:29,946 --> 00:50:31,946
But I won't work every night.

394
00:50:32,749 --> 00:50:34,749
See you tomorrow.

395
00:50:40,290 --> 00:50:43,384
- Yes. Exactly
- That's right.

396
00:50:48,198 --> 00:50:50,198
You need a hand.

397
00:51:14,891 --> 00:51:16,423
- Why all the police?

398
00:51:16,428 --> 00:51:19,055
They're worried
about demonstrators.

399
00:51:19,129 --> 00:51:21,996
- For or against?
- Both.

400
00:51:27,437 --> 00:51:29,437
Wow. It's a circus.

401
00:51:32,208 --> 00:51:34,208
All rise.

402
00:51:36,713 --> 00:51:39,079
All photographers
are now asked to leave.

403
00:51:40,483 --> 00:51:43,281
This court is now in session.
Please sit down.

404
00:51:46,790 --> 00:51:49,315
First thing I'm going to do
is hear motions...

405
00:51:49,392 --> 00:51:51,587
from each of the
defendants' lawyers.

406
00:51:51,661 --> 00:51:53,265
They're arguing that there's...

407
00:51:53,270 --> 00:51:55,495
no reason to keep the
defendants in jail...

408
00:51:55,565 --> 00:51:58,261
until the outcome
of the forthcoming trial.

409
00:51:58,335 --> 00:51:59,992
- I'll take these
cases one by one.

410
00:51:59,997 --> 00:52:01,066
Want a pen?

411
00:52:01,071 --> 00:52:04,370
- I got a pen.
- Hanna Schmitz.

412
00:52:06,009 --> 00:52:09,809
- Your name is Hanna Schmitz?
- Yes.

413
00:52:09,879 --> 00:52:12,245
Can you speak louder please?

414
00:52:12,315 --> 00:52:15,375
- My name is Hanna Schmitz.
- Thank you.

415
00:52:15,452 --> 00:52:20,283
- You were born on
October 21 st, 1922?

416
00:52:20,288 --> 00:52:21,353
Yes.

417
00:52:21,358 --> 00:52:23,254
At Hermannstadt.

418
00:52:23,259 --> 00:52:27,593
- And you're now 43 years old?
- Yes.

419
00:52:27,664 --> 00:52:32,761
- You joined the SS in 1943?
- Yes.

420
00:52:32,836 --> 00:52:35,396
What was your
reason for joining?

421
00:52:37,107 --> 00:52:38,205
You were working...

422
00:52:38,210 --> 00:52:40,235
at the Siemens
factory at the time?

423
00:52:40,310 --> 00:52:41,473
Yes.

424
00:52:41,478 --> 00:52:44,072
You'd recently
been offered a promotion.

425
00:52:44,147 --> 00:52:46,077
Why did you prefer
to join the SS?

426
00:52:46,082 --> 00:52:49,347
- Objection.
- I'll re-phrase my question.

427
00:52:49,419 --> 00:52:52,013
I'm trying to ascertain...

428
00:52:52,088 --> 00:52:55,148
if she joined the
SS freely, hmm?

429
00:52:55,225 --> 00:52:57,225
Of her own free will.

430
00:52:58,261 --> 00:53:01,822
- I heard there were jobs.
- Go on.

431
00:53:01,898 --> 00:53:04,731
I was working at Siemens...

432
00:53:04,801 --> 00:53:08,066
when I heard the
SS was recruiting.

433
00:53:08,138 --> 00:53:12,006
Did you know the kind of work
you'd be expected to do?

434
00:53:12,075 --> 00:53:15,704
They were looking for guards.

435
00:53:15,779 --> 00:53:17,581
- I applied for a job.

436
00:53:17,586 --> 00:53:20,045
You worked first at Auschwitz?

437
00:53:20,116 --> 00:53:23,381
- Yes.
- Until 1944.

438
00:53:23,453 --> 00:53:28,049
Then you were moved to
a smaller camp near Kraków?

439
00:53:28,124 --> 00:53:29,788
- Yes.
- Are you OK?

440
00:53:29,793 --> 00:53:32,523
- You helped move prisoners...
- I'm fine.

441
00:53:32,595 --> 00:53:34,349
...west in the winter of 1944...

442
00:53:34,354 --> 00:53:36,354
in the so-called
death marches?

443
00:53:57,320 --> 00:54:01,017
- So, what did you think?
- I don't know.

444
00:54:02,258 --> 00:54:04,258
It wasn't quite what
I was expecting.

445
00:54:04,294 --> 00:54:08,594
Wasn't it? In what way?
What were you expecting?

446
00:54:08,665 --> 00:54:10,997
I thought it was exciting.

447
00:54:11,067 --> 00:54:13,558
Exciting? Why?

448
00:54:13,636 --> 00:54:16,104
Why did you think
it was exciting?

449
00:54:16,172 --> 00:54:18,172
Because it's justice.

450
00:54:47,137 --> 00:54:52,666
Societies think they operate
by something called morality,

451
00:54:52,742 --> 00:54:54,305
but they don't.

452
00:54:54,310 --> 00:54:58,679
They operate by
something called law.

453
00:54:58,748 --> 00:55:01,606
You're not guilty of anything...

454
00:55:01,611 --> 00:55:04,380
merely by working
at Auschwitz.

455
00:55:04,454 --> 00:55:07,719
Eight thousand people
worked at Auschwitz.

456
00:55:07,791 --> 00:55:10,970
Precisely 19 have
been convicted,

457
00:55:10,975 --> 00:55:13,286
and only six for murder.

458
00:55:13,363 --> 00:55:18,323
To prove murder,
you have to prove intent.

459
00:55:18,401 --> 00:55:20,298
That's the law.

460
00:55:20,303 --> 00:55:24,034
The question is
never was it wrong,

461
00:55:24,107 --> 00:55:26,974
but was it legal.

462
00:55:27,043 --> 00:55:31,810
And not by our laws, no.

463
00:55:31,881 --> 00:55:35,977
- By the laws at the time.
- But isn't that...

464
00:55:36,052 --> 00:55:38,577
- What?
...narrow?

465
00:55:38,655 --> 00:55:42,523
Oh, yes. The law is narrow.

466
00:55:43,526 --> 00:55:45,687
On the other hand.

467
00:55:45,762 --> 00:55:49,220
I suspect people who
kill other people...

468
00:55:49,299 --> 00:55:52,928
tend to be aware
that it's wrong.

469
00:55:54,003 --> 00:55:55,309
Miss Schmitz,

470
00:55:55,314 --> 00:55:58,433
you're familiar
with this book?

471
00:56:00,543 --> 00:56:02,807
- Yes.
- Parts of it...

472
00:56:02,879 --> 00:56:05,347
have already been
read out in court.

473
00:56:05,415 --> 00:56:08,009
It's by a survivor,

474
00:56:08,084 --> 00:56:10,084
a prisoner who survived.

475
00:56:10,086 --> 00:56:12,816
Ilana Mather.

476
00:56:12,889 --> 00:56:13,951
She was in the camp...

477
00:56:13,956 --> 00:56:15,620
when she was a
child, wasn't she?

478
00:56:15,625 --> 00:56:18,321
- She was with her mother.
- Yes.

479
00:56:18,394 --> 00:56:19,522
In the book,

480
00:56:19,527 --> 00:56:22,728
she describes a
selection process.

481
00:56:22,799 --> 00:56:24,820
At the end of the
month's labor,

482
00:56:24,825 --> 00:56:25,897
every month,

483
00:56:25,902 --> 00:56:28,962
sixty inmates were selected.

484
00:56:29,038 --> 00:56:30,570
Picked out to be sent from...

485
00:56:30,575 --> 00:56:32,575
the satellite camp
back to Auschwitz.

486
00:56:32,609 --> 00:56:34,609
That's right, isn't it?

487
00:56:35,912 --> 00:56:38,142
Yes, that's right.

488
00:56:38,214 --> 00:56:39,214
And, so far,

489
00:56:39,219 --> 00:56:41,615
each of your fellow
defendants...

490
00:56:41,684 --> 00:56:44,482
has specifically denied
being part of that process.

491
00:56:44,554 --> 00:56:48,513
Now, I'm going to ask you.

492
00:56:48,591 --> 00:56:50,591
Were you part of it?

493
00:56:52,495 --> 00:56:54,495
Yes.

494
00:56:57,100 --> 00:57:00,695
So you helped make
the selection?

495
00:57:00,770 --> 00:57:03,762
- Yes.
- You admit that?

496
00:57:09,245 --> 00:57:12,442
Then tell me,

497
00:57:12,515 --> 00:57:14,915
how did that selection happen?

498
00:57:14,984 --> 00:57:17,680
There were six guards,

499
00:57:17,754 --> 00:57:22,384
so we decided we'd
choose ten people each.

500
00:57:23,960 --> 00:57:26,622
That's how we did
it every month.

501
00:57:26,696 --> 00:57:28,926
We'd all choose ten.

502
00:57:28,998 --> 00:57:31,728
Your fellow defendants
took part in the process?

503
00:57:31,801 --> 00:57:34,565
We all did.

504
00:57:34,637 --> 00:57:37,299
Even though they've denied it?

505
00:57:37,373 --> 00:57:38,838
Saying 'we,' 'we all'...

506
00:57:38,843 --> 00:57:41,104
is easier than saying
'I,' 'I alone,'

507
00:57:41,177 --> 00:57:43,177
isn't it, Miss Schmitz?

508
00:57:44,514 --> 00:57:47,540
Did you not realize...

509
00:57:47,617 --> 00:57:50,484
that you were sending
these women to their deaths?

510
00:57:50,553 --> 00:57:52,081
But they were new arrivals,

511
00:57:52,086 --> 00:57:54,182
new women were
arriving all the time.

512
00:57:54,257 --> 00:57:57,525
So... the old ones
had to make room...

513
00:57:57,530 --> 00:57:59,530
for the new ones.

514
00:58:00,196 --> 00:58:02,139
- I'm not sure
you understand...

515
00:58:02,144 --> 00:58:03,795
We couldn't keep everyone.

516
00:58:03,800 --> 00:58:06,234
- There wasn't room.
- No.

517
00:58:06,302 --> 00:58:09,237
But what I'm saying...

518
00:58:09,305 --> 00:58:12,069
Let me rephrase.

519
00:58:12,141 --> 00:58:15,008
To make room, you were
picking women out and saying,

520
00:58:15,078 --> 00:58:19,640
'You, you and you have
to be sent back to be killed.'

521
00:58:19,716 --> 00:58:22,184
Well, what would
you have done?

522
00:58:32,762 --> 00:58:35,196
Should I never
have signed up at Siemens?

523
00:58:47,677 --> 00:58:51,272
Ms. Mather,
they're ready for you now.

524
00:58:53,683 --> 00:58:56,243
Go, go. Go, go, go.

525
00:59:07,730 --> 00:59:10,426
- Where's Michael?
- I don't know.

526
00:59:11,768 --> 00:59:16,364
In your book, you describe
the process of selection.

527
00:59:16,439 --> 00:59:18,102
Yes.

528
00:59:18,107 --> 00:59:19,833
You were made to
work and then,

529
00:59:19,838 --> 00:59:22,066
when you were no longer
any use to them,

530
00:59:22,145 --> 00:59:25,581
then they sent you back
to Auschwitz to be killed.

531
00:59:25,648 --> 00:59:28,515
Are there people here
who made that selection?

532
00:59:28,584 --> 00:59:30,515
Yes.

533
00:59:30,520 --> 00:59:35,958
I need you to identify them.
Can you please point them out?

534
00:59:48,671 --> 00:59:50,671
Her.

535
00:59:53,876 --> 00:59:55,876
And her.

536
00:59:57,780 --> 00:59:59,780
Her.

537
01:00:01,617 --> 01:00:03,617
And her.

538
01:00:05,621 --> 01:00:07,621
Her.

539
01:00:09,725 --> 01:00:11,725
And her.

540
01:00:12,962 --> 01:00:15,863
Thank you. Please continue.

541
01:00:15,932 --> 01:00:17,947
Each of the guards
would choose...

542
01:00:17,952 --> 01:00:19,564
a certain number of women.

543
01:00:19,569 --> 01:00:21,730
Hanna Schmitz
chose differently.

544
01:00:21,804 --> 01:00:24,329
In what way differently?

545
01:00:28,945 --> 01:00:31,175
She had favorites.

546
01:00:32,815 --> 01:00:34,645
Girls, mostly young.

547
01:00:34,650 --> 01:00:37,448
We all remarked on it.

548
01:00:37,520 --> 01:00:40,751
She gave them food
and places to sleep.

549
01:00:40,823 --> 01:00:42,227
In the evening,

550
01:00:42,232 --> 01:00:45,419
she... she asked
them to join her.

551
01:00:45,495 --> 01:00:47,158
And we all thought...

552
01:00:47,163 --> 01:00:50,189
Well, you can imagine
what we thought.

553
01:00:50,266 --> 01:00:53,427
And then we found
out she was making...

554
01:00:53,432 --> 01:00:55,863
these women read aloud to her.

555
01:00:58,574 --> 01:01:00,701
They were reading to her.

556
01:01:01,944 --> 01:01:04,983
At first, we
thought this guard,

557
01:01:04,988 --> 01:01:06,577
this guard is...

558
01:01:06,582 --> 01:01:08,331
...more sensitive,

559
01:01:08,336 --> 01:01:11,349
she's more human,
she's kinder.

560
01:01:12,255 --> 01:01:15,656
Often, she chose
the weak, the sick.

561
01:01:17,360 --> 01:01:18,480
She picked them out.

562
01:01:18,485 --> 01:01:20,727
She seemed to be
protecting them almost.

563
01:01:20,796 --> 01:01:23,356
But then she dispatched them.

564
01:01:26,335 --> 01:01:28,428
Is that kinder?

565
01:01:37,246 --> 01:01:40,409
I want to
move on now to the march.

566
01:01:40,483 --> 01:01:42,428
As I understand
it, you and your...

567
01:01:42,433 --> 01:01:44,544
daughter were marched
for many months.

568
01:01:44,620 --> 01:01:48,784
In the winter of 1944,
our camp was closed down.

569
01:01:48,858 --> 01:01:51,132
We were told we
had to move on.

570
01:01:51,137 --> 01:01:53,852
But the plan kept
changing every day.

571
01:01:53,930 --> 01:01:57,730
Women were dying
all around us in the snow.

572
01:01:57,800 --> 01:02:02,362
Half of us died on the march.
My daughter says in the book,

573
01:02:02,438 --> 01:02:05,737
'Less a death march,
more a death gallop.'

574
01:02:07,410 --> 01:02:11,506
Please tell us about
the night in the church.

575
01:02:19,322 --> 01:02:21,713
That night, we thought
we were lucky...

576
01:02:21,718 --> 01:02:23,986
because we had a
roof over our heads.

577
01:02:24,060 --> 01:02:26,927
Go on.

578
01:02:26,996 --> 01:02:30,090
We'd arrived in a village.

579
01:02:30,166 --> 01:02:32,365
As always, the guards
took the best...

580
01:02:32,370 --> 01:02:34,626
quarters. They took
the priest's house.

581
01:02:34,704 --> 01:02:38,162
But they let us
sleep in a church.

582
01:02:38,241 --> 01:02:41,733
There was a bombing raid
in the middle of the night.

583
01:02:41,811 --> 01:02:43,972
The church was hit.

584
01:02:45,648 --> 01:02:48,008
At first, we could
only hear the fire.

585
01:02:48,013 --> 01:02:50,013
It was in the steeple.

586
01:02:51,320 --> 01:02:54,221
Then we could see
burning beams...

587
01:02:55,825 --> 01:02:58,385
...and they began to
crash to the floor.

588
01:03:00,930 --> 01:03:03,194
Everyone rushed...

589
01:03:05,134 --> 01:03:07,568
...rushed to the doors.

590
01:03:09,739 --> 01:03:13,470
But the doors had been
locked on the outside.

591
01:03:13,542 --> 01:03:17,876
The church burned down?
Nobody came to open the doors?

592
01:03:17,947 --> 01:03:20,882
Is that right?

593
01:03:20,950 --> 01:03:22,950
Nobody.

594
01:03:22,985 --> 01:03:26,216
Even though you
were all burning to death?

595
01:03:29,392 --> 01:03:31,417
How many people were killed?

596
01:03:31,494 --> 01:03:34,554
Everyone was killed.

597
01:03:37,099 --> 01:03:39,099
But you survived?

598
01:03:46,809 --> 01:03:48,809
Thank you.

599
01:03:50,579 --> 01:03:54,310
I want to thank you
for coming to this country...

600
01:03:54,383 --> 01:03:56,578
today to testify.

601
01:04:00,756 --> 01:04:05,022
I don't know. I don't know
what we're doing here anymore.

602
01:04:05,094 --> 01:04:07,426
Don't you?

603
01:04:07,496 --> 01:04:09,496
You tell us to
think like lawyers,

604
01:04:09,498 --> 01:04:13,559
but there's something...
disgusting about this.

605
01:04:13,636 --> 01:04:14,136
- How so?

606
01:04:14,141 --> 01:04:16,100
This didn't happen
to the Germans.

607
01:04:16,105 --> 01:04:18,266
It happened to the Jews.

608
01:04:19,041 --> 01:04:22,442
- What are we trying to do?
- We're trying to understand.

609
01:04:22,511 --> 01:04:24,498
Six women locked 300
Jews in a church...

610
01:04:24,503 --> 01:04:25,576
and let them burn.

611
01:04:25,581 --> 01:04:27,811
What is there to understand?

612
01:04:30,419 --> 01:04:33,946
Tell me. I'm asking.
What is there to understand?

613
01:04:37,159 --> 01:04:39,169
I started out believing
in this trial.

614
01:04:39,174 --> 01:04:40,458
I thought it was great.

615
01:04:40,463 --> 01:04:43,796
Now, I think it's...
it's just a diversion.

616
01:04:43,866 --> 01:04:46,733
Yes? Diversion from what?

617
01:04:46,802 --> 01:04:49,794
You choose six women,
you put them on trial,

618
01:04:49,872 --> 01:04:51,689
you say, 'They were
the evil ones,

619
01:04:51,694 --> 01:04:53,204
they were the guilty ones.'

620
01:04:53,209 --> 01:04:55,734
One of the victims
happened to write a book.

621
01:04:55,811 --> 01:04:58,871
That's why they're on trial
and nobody else.

622
01:04:58,948 --> 01:05:02,247
Do you know how many camps
there were in Europe?

623
01:05:02,318 --> 01:05:04,752
People go on about
how much did everyone know?

624
01:05:04,820 --> 01:05:08,688
Who knew? What did they know?
Everyone knew.

625
01:05:08,758 --> 01:05:13,422
Our parents, our teachers.
That isn't the question.

626
01:05:13,496 --> 01:05:15,626
The question is,
'How'd you let this happen?'

627
01:05:15,631 --> 01:05:16,984
Better, 'Why didn't you...

628
01:05:16,989 --> 01:05:18,989
kill yourself when
you found out?'

629
01:05:21,604 --> 01:05:24,971
Thousands. That's how many.
There were thousands of camps.

630
01:05:25,040 --> 01:05:27,040
Everyone knew.

631
01:05:35,518 --> 01:05:37,518
Look at that woman.

632
01:05:38,788 --> 01:05:39,803
- Which woman?

633
01:05:39,808 --> 01:05:42,349
The woman you're
always staring at.

634
01:05:42,425 --> 01:05:44,425
I'm sorry, but you are.

635
01:05:53,002 --> 01:05:55,002
I don't know which
woman you mean.

636
01:05:56,305 --> 01:05:58,305
You know what I'd do?

637
01:06:00,576 --> 01:06:04,273
Put the gun in my hand,
I'd shoot her myself.

638
01:06:07,616 --> 01:06:09,616
Shoot them all.

639
01:09:05,094 --> 01:09:07,392
Why did you
not unlock the doors?

640
01:09:09,632 --> 01:09:12,226
Why did you not
unlock the doors?

641
01:09:15,337 --> 01:09:18,431
I've asked all of you,
and I'm getting no answer.

642
01:09:19,541 --> 01:09:21,657
Two of the victims
are in this court.

643
01:09:21,662 --> 01:09:23,662
They deserve an answer.

644
01:09:26,982 --> 01:09:29,780
This is the SS report.
You all have copies.

645
01:09:31,253 --> 01:09:32,839
The report which was written,

646
01:09:32,844 --> 01:09:34,844
approved and signed
by all of you...

647
01:09:34,890 --> 01:09:38,451
immediately after the event.
In the written report,

648
01:09:38,527 --> 01:09:40,829
you all claim you
didn't even know...

649
01:09:40,834 --> 01:09:43,260
about the fire until
after it happened.

650
01:09:43,332 --> 01:09:45,630
But that isn't true, is it?

651
01:09:46,869 --> 01:09:48,869
Well?

652
01:09:49,938 --> 01:09:51,938
It's not true.

653
01:09:55,477 --> 01:09:57,507
- I don't know what
you're asking.

654
01:09:57,512 --> 01:09:59,309
The first thing I'm asking...

655
01:09:59,314 --> 01:10:02,109
- is why didn't you
unlock the doors?

656
01:10:02,114 --> 01:10:03,180
Obviously.

657
01:10:03,185 --> 01:10:05,185
For the obvious reason.

658
01:10:06,355 --> 01:10:08,482
- We couldn't.
- Why couldn't you?

659
01:10:08,557 --> 01:10:11,424
We were guards.

660
01:10:11,493 --> 01:10:14,985
Our job was to
guard the prisoners.

661
01:10:15,064 --> 01:10:17,362
We couldn't just
let them escape.

662
01:10:17,433 --> 01:10:20,698
I see. And if they escaped,
then you'd be blamed,

663
01:10:20,769 --> 01:10:23,203
you'd be charged,
you might even be executed?

664
01:10:23,272 --> 01:10:25,365
- No.
- Well, then?

665
01:10:25,441 --> 01:10:28,740
If we'd opened the doors,
there would have been chaos.

666
01:10:28,811 --> 01:10:31,575
How could we have
restored order?

667
01:10:31,647 --> 01:10:34,775
It happened so fast.
It was snowing. The bombs.

668
01:10:34,850 --> 01:10:36,803
The flames... There
were flames...

669
01:10:36,808 --> 01:10:38,082
all over the village.

670
01:10:38,087 --> 01:10:41,250
Then the screaming began,
and got worse and worse.

671
01:10:41,323 --> 01:10:42,985
If they'd all
come rushing out,

672
01:10:42,990 --> 01:10:44,822
we couldn't just
let them escape.

673
01:10:44,827 --> 01:10:48,991
We couldn't.
We were responsible for them.

674
01:10:52,201 --> 01:10:54,302
So you did know
what was happening?

675
01:10:54,307 --> 01:10:56,300
You did know? You
made a choice.

676
01:10:56,305 --> 01:10:59,035
You let them die,

677
01:10:59,108 --> 01:11:01,770
rather than risk
letting them escape.

678
01:11:04,513 --> 01:11:08,108
The other defendants have made
an allegation against you.

679
01:11:08,183 --> 01:11:10,183
Have you heard
this allegation?

680
01:11:11,186 --> 01:11:14,246
They say you were in charge.

681
01:11:14,323 --> 01:11:15,323
It isn't true.

682
01:11:15,328 --> 01:11:17,349
I was... I was just
one of the guards.

683
01:11:17,426 --> 01:11:19,894
- She was in charge.
- She was.

684
01:11:19,962 --> 01:11:22,430
- Of course she was.
- Did you write the report?

685
01:11:22,498 --> 01:11:25,381
No. No. We all
discussed what to say.

686
01:11:25,386 --> 01:11:27,386
We all wrote it together.

687
01:11:27,402 --> 01:11:29,666
She wrote the report.
She was in charge.

688
01:11:29,738 --> 01:11:31,201
- Is that true?
- No.

689
01:11:31,206 --> 01:11:33,036
- Yes, you did.
- Does it matter?

690
01:11:33,041 --> 01:11:35,168
- She wrote it.
- I need a sample...

691
01:11:35,244 --> 01:11:39,374
- of your handwriting.
- My...

692
01:11:39,448 --> 01:11:41,780
- My handwriting?
- Yes. I need to establish...

693
01:11:41,850 --> 01:11:43,115
- who wrote the report.

694
01:11:43,120 --> 01:11:45,120
I don't see how
that's appropriate.

695
01:11:45,120 --> 01:11:46,404
- 20 years have gone by.

696
01:11:46,409 --> 01:11:48,352
Take her paper.
Approach the bench.

697
01:11:48,357 --> 01:11:50,595
- Compare handwriting
of 20 years?

698
01:11:50,600 --> 01:11:52,600
Approach the bench.

699
01:11:57,032 --> 01:11:59,398
I will not be overruled
in my own court.

700
01:11:59,468 --> 01:12:01,663
I'm sorry...

701
01:12:09,211 --> 01:12:11,211
I'd rather listen to you.

702
01:12:30,899 --> 01:12:32,899
There's no need.

703
01:12:36,772 --> 01:12:38,772
I wrote the report.

704
01:12:52,654 --> 01:12:55,022
Silence, please.

705
01:12:56,325 --> 01:12:58,325
Order.

706
01:13:10,038 --> 01:13:12,666
You've been skipping seminars.

707
01:13:35,964 --> 01:13:38,660
I have a piece of information.

708
01:13:38,734 --> 01:13:41,635
Concerning one of
the defendants.

709
01:13:41,703 --> 01:13:43,695
- Something they're
not admitting.

710
01:13:43,700 --> 01:13:45,700
What information?

711
01:13:53,615 --> 01:13:55,579
You don't need me to tell you.

712
01:13:55,584 --> 01:13:58,194
It's perfectly clear.
You have a moral...

713
01:13:58,199 --> 01:14:00,681
obligation to disclose
it to the court.

714
01:14:00,756 --> 01:14:04,522
It happens this information
is favorable to the defendant.

715
01:14:04,593 --> 01:14:06,925
It can help her case.

716
01:14:06,995 --> 01:14:09,077
It may even affect
the outcome,

717
01:14:09,082 --> 01:14:10,827
certainly the sentencing.

718
01:14:10,832 --> 01:14:15,269
- So?
- There's a problem.

719
01:14:15,337 --> 01:14:17,521
The defendant herself
is determined...

720
01:14:17,526 --> 01:14:19,526
to keep this
information secret.

721
01:14:23,145 --> 01:14:25,272
- A moment, please.
- Sorry.

722
01:14:33,555 --> 01:14:35,853
What are her reasons?

723
01:14:38,293 --> 01:14:40,420
Because she's ashamed.

724
01:14:41,563 --> 01:14:43,895
Ashamed of what?

725
01:14:49,271 --> 01:14:53,037
- Have you spoken to her?
- Of course not.

726
01:14:53,108 --> 01:14:56,475
Why 'of course not?'

727
01:14:56,545 --> 01:14:58,545
I can't.

728
01:14:59,614 --> 01:15:02,310
I can't do that.

729
01:15:02,384 --> 01:15:04,348
I can't talk to her.

730
01:15:04,353 --> 01:15:09,313
What we feel isn't important.
It's utterly unimportant.

731
01:15:09,391 --> 01:15:11,791
The only question
is what we do.

732
01:15:13,929 --> 01:15:16,061
If people like you don't learn...

733
01:15:16,066 --> 01:15:18,457
from what happened
to people like me,

734
01:15:18,533 --> 01:15:21,832
then what the hell
is the point of anything?

735
01:15:29,945 --> 01:15:32,505
Schmitz?

736
01:15:32,581 --> 01:15:34,811
You have a visitor.

737
01:15:47,662 --> 01:15:49,994
Quiet, please.

738
01:15:50,065 --> 01:15:53,193
Gertrud Ballow.

739
01:15:54,836 --> 01:15:57,669
Andreas Michael Springer.

740
01:16:00,776 --> 01:16:02,776
Michael Berg.

741
01:16:06,014 --> 01:16:08,448
Walter Sherman.

742
01:17:42,711 --> 01:17:44,711
Time's up.

743
01:18:03,899 --> 01:18:05,899
Are you coming in?

744
01:18:15,710 --> 01:18:17,710
You took your time.

745
01:18:40,135 --> 01:18:42,135
What is it?

746
01:19:03,525 --> 01:19:06,460
Where are you going?

747
01:19:06,528 --> 01:19:09,053
I'm sorry.

748
01:19:09,130 --> 01:19:11,130
I need to sleep by myself.

749
01:19:56,878 --> 01:19:58,878
I'll just be a minute.

750
01:20:28,343 --> 01:20:30,343
- Nazi.
- Nazi whore.

751
01:20:30,345 --> 01:20:33,178
Nazi.

752
01:20:41,823 --> 01:20:46,157
Silence in the court.
Silence in the court.

753
01:20:46,227 --> 01:20:48,227
All rise.

754
01:20:54,602 --> 01:20:57,537
The court
finds guilty the defendants

755
01:20:57,605 --> 01:21:00,267
Rita Beckhart,
Caroline Steinhoff.

756
01:21:00,342 --> 01:21:02,810
Regina Kroit, Angela Zeva...

757
01:21:02,877 --> 01:21:05,141
and Andrea Lumen...

758
01:21:05,213 --> 01:21:08,937
of jointly aiding and
abetting murder...

759
01:21:08,942 --> 01:21:10,213
in 300 cases.

760
01:21:10,218 --> 01:21:13,085
The court finds
guilty the defendant

761
01:21:13,154 --> 01:21:17,818
Hanna Schmitz of
murder in 300 cases.

762
01:21:22,097 --> 01:21:25,191
The court sentences
the accused as follows:

763
01:21:25,266 --> 01:21:28,394
Rita Beckhart,
Caroline Steinhoff.

764
01:21:28,470 --> 01:21:33,203
Regina Kroit, Angela Zeva
and Andrea Lumen...

765
01:21:33,274 --> 01:21:36,392
to each serve a total
sentence in prison...

766
01:21:36,397 --> 01:21:38,644
of four years
and three months.

767
01:21:38,713 --> 01:21:41,011
Hanna Schmitz,

768
01:21:41,082 --> 01:21:44,813
in view of your own admissions
and your special role,

769
01:21:44,886 --> 01:21:47,912
you're in a
different category.

770
01:21:47,989 --> 01:21:50,507
The court sentences
the accused.

771
01:21:50,512 --> 01:21:53,188
Schmitz, to
imprisonment for life.

772
01:22:26,060 --> 01:22:28,060
Where are we going?

773
01:22:28,062 --> 01:22:30,997
I said I'll tell you
when we get there.

774
01:22:31,065 --> 01:22:34,127
- You told me you
liked surprises.

775
01:22:34,132 --> 01:22:36,132
I like surprises.

776
01:22:53,455 --> 01:22:55,650
She's grown, hasn't she?

777
01:22:57,425 --> 01:22:59,237
I don't know. It's
so long since

778
01:22:59,242 --> 01:23:01,242
I saw her, Michael.
How can I tell?

779
01:23:03,465 --> 01:23:04,691
It's my fault.

780
01:23:04,696 --> 01:23:07,765
We shouldn't have
come unannounced.

781
01:23:07,836 --> 01:23:10,999
Daddy's going to live
in his own house.

782
01:23:14,175 --> 01:23:17,406
Mother, I'm afraid
I have some bad news.

783
01:23:17,479 --> 01:23:20,505
Julia knows.
We've already told her.

784
01:23:20,582 --> 01:23:22,743
Gertrud and I,
we are getting a divorce.

785
01:23:22,817 --> 01:23:24,950
You don't come for
your father's...

786
01:23:24,955 --> 01:23:26,955
funeral, but you
come for this?

787
01:23:29,290 --> 01:23:31,349
It's not easy
for me to visit this town.

788
01:23:31,426 --> 01:23:34,554
- Were you really so unhappy?
- That's not what I'm saying.

789
01:23:34,629 --> 01:23:37,097
- It's not what I meant.
- Well, then?

790
01:23:39,467 --> 01:23:41,776
You mustn't worry
about Gertrud.

791
01:23:41,781 --> 01:23:43,801
I'm going to look after her.

792
01:23:43,872 --> 01:23:46,053
She's already a
state prosecutor,

793
01:23:46,058 --> 01:23:48,172
so she earns far
more than I do.

794
01:23:48,243 --> 01:23:50,243
Michael...

795
01:23:51,579 --> 01:23:54,548
...I'm not worried
about Gertrud.

796
01:23:54,616 --> 01:23:56,616
I'm worried about you.

893
01:34:17,838 --> 01:34:20,306
You're her only contact.

894
01:34:20,374 --> 01:34:23,639
And I'm told you
don't visit her.

895
01:34:23,711 --> 01:34:25,508
No, I don't.

896
01:34:25,513 --> 01:34:27,879
When she gets out,
she's going to need a job.

897
01:34:27,948 --> 01:34:30,314
She's going to need
somewhere to live.

898
01:34:30,384 --> 01:34:32,593
You can't imagine
how frightening...

899
01:34:32,598 --> 01:34:34,684
the modern world
will seem to her.

900
01:34:38,125 --> 01:34:40,125
Mm-hmm.

901
01:34:42,897 --> 01:34:44,897
I have no one else to ask.

902
01:34:45,866 --> 01:34:48,767
If you don't take
responsibility for her,

903
01:34:48,836 --> 01:34:51,464
then Hanna has no
future at all.

904
01:34:54,875 --> 01:34:57,070
It's kind of you.

905
01:34:57,144 --> 01:34:59,408
Thank you for letting me know.

906
01:35:43,290 --> 01:35:45,054
- You're Michael Berg?
- Yes.

907
01:35:45,059 --> 01:35:47,059
I'm Louisa Brenner.
Good morning.

908
01:35:47,094 --> 01:35:48,287
- How do you do?

909
01:35:48,292 --> 01:35:50,530
We were expecting you earlier.

910
01:35:50,598 --> 01:35:52,842
I should warn you,
for a long time

911
01:35:52,847 --> 01:35:54,763
Hanna held herself together.

912
01:35:54,768 --> 01:35:56,840
She was very
purposeful. In the...

913
01:35:56,845 --> 01:35:58,845
last few years,
she's different.

914
01:35:58,872 --> 01:36:01,067
She's let herself go.

915
01:36:04,111 --> 01:36:07,171
I'm taking you straight
to the canteen.

916
01:36:08,482 --> 01:36:10,643
They've just finished
their lunch.

917
01:36:22,696 --> 01:36:24,696
Table four.

918
01:37:10,177 --> 01:37:12,509
You've grown up, kid.

919
01:37:26,860 --> 01:37:28,860
I've got a friend
who's a tailor.

920
01:37:32,032 --> 01:37:34,032
He'll give you a job.

921
01:37:35,436 --> 01:37:37,676
And I've found you
somewhere to live.

922
01:37:37,681 --> 01:37:38,834
It's a nice place.

923
01:37:38,839 --> 01:37:40,839
Quite small, but it's nice.

924
01:37:42,009 --> 01:37:44,443
- You'll like it.
- Thank you.

925
01:37:46,280 --> 01:37:48,685
There are various
social programs,

926
01:37:48,690 --> 01:37:51,308
cultural stuff I
can sign you up for.

927
01:37:51,385 --> 01:37:54,081
And the public
library is very close.

928
01:38:00,561 --> 01:38:02,561
You read a lot?

929
01:38:04,798 --> 01:38:07,426
I prefer being read to.

930
01:38:12,072 --> 01:38:14,072
That's over now, isn't it?

931
01:38:23,617 --> 01:38:25,710
Did you get married?

932
01:38:25,786 --> 01:38:28,914
I did. Yes, I did.

933
01:38:28,989 --> 01:38:31,048
We have a daughter.

934
01:38:31,125 --> 01:38:34,561
I'm not seeing as much of her
as I'd like.

935
01:38:34,628 --> 01:38:37,153
I'd like to see
a great deal more of her.

936
01:38:39,400 --> 01:38:41,493
The marriage didn't last.

937
01:38:56,917 --> 01:38:59,385
Have you spent time
thinking about the past?

938
01:38:59,453 --> 01:39:03,253
- You mean with you?
- No.

939
01:39:03,323 --> 01:39:07,054
No, I didn't mean with me.

940
01:39:16,537 --> 01:39:17,868
Before the trial,

941
01:39:17,873 --> 01:39:20,303
I never thought
about the past.

942
01:39:20,374 --> 01:39:22,535
I never had to.

943
01:39:22,609 --> 01:39:24,873
Now?

944
01:39:26,146 --> 01:39:28,146
What do you feel now?

945
01:39:29,316 --> 01:39:31,648
It doesn't matter what I feel.

946
01:39:32,653 --> 01:39:34,780
It doesn't matter
what I think.

947
01:39:36,890 --> 01:39:38,890
The dead are still dead.

948
01:39:46,200 --> 01:39:48,200
I wasn't sure what
you'd learned.

949
01:39:48,202 --> 01:39:52,070
Well, I have learned, kid.

950
01:39:52,139 --> 01:39:54,539
I've learned to read.

951
01:40:08,422 --> 01:40:10,422
I'll pick you up
next week, OK?

952
01:40:19,433 --> 01:40:21,433
That sounds a good plan.

953
01:40:24,037 --> 01:40:27,700
We can do it quietly,
or we can make a fuss.

954
01:40:27,774 --> 01:40:29,774
Quietly.

955
01:40:31,645 --> 01:40:33,875
OK. Quietly.

956
01:40:36,617 --> 01:40:38,617
Quietly.

957
01:40:47,094 --> 01:40:51,121
- Take care, kid.
- You, too. See you next week.

958
01:43:03,830 --> 01:43:06,321
I've come to collect
Hanna Schmitz.

959
01:43:10,237 --> 01:43:13,502
Please. Please, take a seat.

960
01:43:38,799 --> 01:43:41,427
She didn't pack.

961
01:43:41,501 --> 01:43:43,799
She never intended to leave.

962
01:43:49,543 --> 01:43:53,001
'The talk was that
a new face...

963
01:43:53,080 --> 01:43:56,675
had appeared on the promenade,

964
01:43:56,750 --> 01:43:59,446
a lady with a little dog.'

965
01:44:06,493 --> 01:44:08,493
She left me a message.

966
01:44:10,097 --> 01:44:12,097
A sort of will.

967
01:44:14,067 --> 01:44:17,002
I'll read the bit
that concerns you.

968
01:44:24,778 --> 01:44:27,770
'There is money in
the old tea tin.

969
01:44:27,848 --> 01:44:30,612
Give it to Michael Berg.

970
01:44:30,684 --> 01:44:32,181
He should send it,

971
01:44:32,186 --> 01:44:35,348
alongside the 7,000
Marks in the bank,

972
01:44:35,422 --> 01:44:39,222
to the daughter who
survived the fire.

973
01:44:39,292 --> 01:44:41,453
It's for her.

974
01:44:41,528 --> 01:44:44,554
She should decide
what to do with it.

975
01:44:48,068 --> 01:44:50,901
And tell Michael
I said hello.'

976
01:46:09,182 --> 01:46:11,548
- Ms. Mather?
- Yes.

977
01:46:12,252 --> 01:46:14,379
- You're Michael Berg.
- Yes.

978
01:46:14,454 --> 01:46:16,454
I was expecting you.

979
01:46:17,724 --> 01:46:21,421
- Please.
- Thank you.

980
01:46:21,494 --> 01:46:23,853
So you must tell
me, exactly what...

981
01:46:23,858 --> 01:46:25,954
brings you to the
United States?

982
01:46:26,032 --> 01:46:27,182
I was here already.

983
01:46:27,187 --> 01:46:29,187
I was at a conference
in Boston.

984
01:46:29,202 --> 01:46:30,565
- You're a lawyer?
- Yes.

985
01:46:30,570 --> 01:46:32,810
I was intrigued
by your letter,

986
01:46:32,815 --> 01:46:35,633
but I can't say I
wholly understood it.

987
01:46:35,709 --> 01:46:39,736
- You attended the trial?
- Yes. Almost 20 years ago.

988
01:46:39,813 --> 01:46:42,729
I was a law student.
I remember you.

989
01:46:42,734 --> 01:46:45,649
I remember your
mother very clearly.

990
01:46:45,719 --> 01:46:49,587
My mother died in Israel
a good many years ago.

991
01:46:49,656 --> 01:46:53,092
I... I'm sorry.

992
01:46:53,159 --> 01:46:55,159
Go on, please.

993
01:46:56,930 --> 01:46:58,894
Perhaps you heard.

994
01:46:58,899 --> 01:47:03,700
Hanna Schmitz recently died.
She killed herself.

995
01:47:05,038 --> 01:47:07,038
She was a friend of yours?

996
01:47:08,008 --> 01:47:10,008
A kind of friend.

997
01:47:10,977 --> 01:47:13,002
It's as simple as this.

998
01:47:13,079 --> 01:47:14,871
Hanna was illiterate...

999
01:47:14,876 --> 01:47:17,448
for the greater
part of her life.

1000
01:47:17,517 --> 01:47:20,680
Is that an explanation
of her behavior?

1001
01:47:22,389 --> 01:47:24,653
- No.
- Or an excuse?

1002
01:47:24,724 --> 01:47:26,817
No. No.

1003
01:47:29,896 --> 01:47:33,627
She taught herself to read
when she was in prison.

1004
01:47:33,700 --> 01:47:36,362
I sent her tapes.

1005
01:47:38,972 --> 01:47:42,840
She had always liked...
being read to.

1006
01:47:49,716 --> 01:47:52,446
Why don't you start
by being honest with me?

1007
01:47:52,519 --> 01:47:55,579
At least start that way.

1008
01:47:55,655 --> 01:47:58,283
What was the nature
of your friendship?

1009
01:48:03,196 --> 01:48:06,029
When I was young,
I had an affair with Hanna.

1010
01:48:11,972 --> 01:48:13,935
I'm not sure I can
help you, Mr. Berg.

1011
01:48:13,940 --> 01:48:16,101
And...

1012
01:48:16,176 --> 01:48:18,337
...even if I could,
I'm not willing to.

1013
01:48:18,411 --> 01:48:21,039
I was almost 16
when I took up with her.

1014
01:48:21,114 --> 01:48:23,340
The affair only
lasted a summer.

1015
01:48:23,345 --> 01:48:25,345
But...

1016
01:48:25,919 --> 01:48:28,046
But what?

1017
01:48:33,893 --> 01:48:35,893
I see.

1018
01:48:37,831 --> 01:48:40,280
And did Hanna Schmitz
acknowledge...

1019
01:48:40,285 --> 01:48:42,598
the effect she'd
had on your life?

1020
01:48:44,337 --> 01:48:47,670
She'd done much worse
to other people.

1021
01:48:52,645 --> 01:48:54,645
I've never told anyone.

1022
01:48:58,685 --> 01:49:01,984
People ask all the time
what I learned in the camps.

1023
01:49:02,055 --> 01:49:04,785
But the camps weren't therapy.

1024
01:49:06,893 --> 01:49:08,618
What do you think
these places were,

1025
01:49:08,623 --> 01:49:10,623
universities?

1026
01:49:11,264 --> 01:49:13,858
We didn't go there to learn.

1027
01:49:13,933 --> 01:49:17,994
One becomes very clear
about these things.

1028
01:49:21,441 --> 01:49:24,137
What are you asking for?
Forgiveness for her?

1029
01:49:24,210 --> 01:49:26,974
Or do you just want
to feel better yourself?

1030
01:49:27,047 --> 01:49:30,881
My advice? Go to the theater
if you want catharsis. Please.

1031
01:49:30,950 --> 01:49:32,914
Go to literature.

1032
01:49:32,919 --> 01:49:36,116
Don't go to the camps.

1033
01:49:37,690 --> 01:49:40,124
Nothing comes
out of the camps.

1034
01:49:42,629 --> 01:49:44,688
Nothing.

1035
01:49:57,977 --> 01:49:59,977
What she wanted...

1036
01:50:00,747 --> 01:50:05,184
What she wanted was
to leave you her money.

1037
01:50:05,251 --> 01:50:08,084
- I have it with me.
- To do what?

1038
01:50:10,190 --> 01:50:12,190
As you think fit.

1039
01:50:22,936 --> 01:50:24,936
Here.

1040
01:50:33,079 --> 01:50:35,146
When I was a little girl,

1041
01:50:35,151 --> 01:50:37,880
I had a tea tin
for my treasures.

1042
01:50:37,951 --> 01:50:42,251
Not quite like this.
It had Cyrillic lettering.

1043
01:50:45,125 --> 01:50:48,390
I took it with me to the camp,
but it got stolen.

1044
01:50:48,461 --> 01:50:51,953
- What was in it?
- Sentimental things.

1045
01:50:52,031 --> 01:50:56,161
A piece of hair from our dog.
Some tickets to the operas...

1046
01:50:56,236 --> 01:50:57,924
my father had taken me to.

1047
01:50:57,929 --> 01:51:00,138
It wasn't stolen
for its contents.

1048
01:51:00,206 --> 01:51:04,108
It was the tin itself...

1049
01:51:04,177 --> 01:51:06,805
that was valuable,

1050
01:51:06,880 --> 01:51:08,880
what you could do with it.

1051
01:51:16,756 --> 01:51:19,691
There's nothing
I can do with this money.

1052
01:51:19,759 --> 01:51:21,676
I give it to anything
associated...

1053
01:51:21,681 --> 01:51:23,224
with extermination of Jews,

1054
01:51:23,229 --> 01:51:25,823
then to me it seems...

1055
01:51:25,899 --> 01:51:27,606
...like absolution, and that's...

1056
01:51:27,611 --> 01:51:29,330
something I'm
neither willing...

1057
01:51:29,335 --> 01:51:33,066
- nor in a position to grant.
- I was thinking maybe...

1058
01:51:33,139 --> 01:51:37,007
an organization to
encourage literacy.

1059
01:51:40,847 --> 01:51:43,372
Good. Good.

1060
01:51:43,449 --> 01:51:46,316
Do you know if there
is a Jewish organization?

1061
01:51:46,386 --> 01:51:48,216
I'd be surprised
if there isn't.

1062
01:51:48,221 --> 01:51:51,850
There's a Jewish organization
for everything.

1063
01:51:51,925 --> 01:51:55,019
Not that illiteracy
is a very Jewish problem.

1064
01:51:56,863 --> 01:52:00,128
Why don't you find out?
Send them the money.

1065
01:52:16,349 --> 01:52:18,349
Shall I do it in Hanna's name?

1066
01:52:20,286 --> 01:52:22,286
As you think fit.

1067
01:52:27,093 --> 01:52:29,093
I'll keep the tin.

1068
01:52:33,833 --> 01:52:35,833
Thank you.

1069
01:53:27,387 --> 01:53:29,333
- Where are we going?

1070
01:53:29,338 --> 01:53:32,120
I thought you liked surprises.

1071
01:53:32,191 --> 01:53:35,319
I do. I do like surprises.

1072
01:54:39,592 --> 01:54:42,390
Hanna Schmitz.

1073
01:54:46,733 --> 01:54:48,733
Who was she?

1074
01:54:50,370 --> 01:54:52,770
That's what I
wanted to tell you.

1075
01:54:54,941 --> 01:54:57,068
That's why we're here.

1076
01:55:05,251 --> 01:55:07,251
So tell me.

1077
01:55:18,564 --> 01:55:20,998
I was 15.

1078
01:55:23,569 --> 01:55:26,094
I was coming home from school.

1079
01:55:28,174 --> 01:55:30,174
I was feeling ill.

1080
01:55:31,310 --> 01:55:33,744
And a woman helped me.

1081
01:55:35,243 --> 01:55:41,243
