1
00:01:09,199 --> 00:01:10,679
She was taking
pictures at the border.

2
00:01:11,506 --> 00:01:12,942
Journalist?

3
00:01:12,985 --> 00:01:15,814
No... Tourist.

4
00:01:15,858 --> 00:01:17,207
Take care of it.

5
00:01:17,251 --> 00:01:19,166
Please. Grant me mercy

6
00:01:19,209 --> 00:01:23,996
and I will pray for the
success of your cause.

7
00:01:25,737 --> 00:01:28,349
Ladies and gentlemen, what
you're about to witness

8
00:01:28,392 --> 00:01:31,003
is the next evolution
in military engagement.

9
00:01:31,047 --> 00:01:34,485
A machine that operates
with surgical precision.

10
00:01:34,529 --> 00:01:35,878
And in a world
where every action

11
00:01:35,921 --> 00:01:37,488
is under the media microscope,

12
00:01:37,532 --> 00:01:39,838
this technology will
allow our nation

13
00:01:39,882 --> 00:01:43,407
and its allies the means
to act quickly, decisively

14
00:01:43,451 --> 00:01:45,496
and without the specter
of political blowback.

15
00:01:46,976 --> 00:01:49,413
Madam Secretary, glad
you could join us.

16
00:01:49,457 --> 00:01:51,328
Would you mind explaining
to me why you're conducting

17
00:01:51,372 --> 00:01:53,678
a joint military operation
without my approval?

18
00:01:53,722 --> 00:01:55,637
I appreciate it looks
like that, Shelly,

19
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,900
but we're here strictly
as technical support.

20
00:01:57,943 --> 00:02:00,294
The mission's being conducted
by Saudi intelligence.

21
00:02:00,337 --> 00:02:02,383
We're merely loaning
out the asset.

22
00:02:02,426 --> 00:02:04,863
What are you talking
about? What asset?

23
00:02:35,459 --> 00:02:36,591
Eyes are up.

24
00:03:31,602 --> 00:03:33,169
You shoot me - we both die!

25
00:03:33,213 --> 00:03:35,127
Naveen Tripathi. Where is he?

26
00:03:35,171 --> 00:03:38,305
He's here. I can
take you to him.

27
00:04:00,762 --> 00:04:02,546
What you just saw
was not only a test

28
00:04:02,590 --> 00:04:04,156
of our technological prowess

29
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:05,984
but a clear message
to our enemies.

30
00:04:06,028 --> 00:04:09,205
If the 21st century
wants another arms race,

31
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:11,425
you better goddamn believe
we intend to win it.

32
00:04:14,166 --> 00:04:15,429
What the hell was that?

33
00:04:15,472 --> 00:04:16,821
She just shot Tripathi.

34
00:04:19,346 --> 00:04:21,130
-Someone get her on the comms.
-She's not responding.

35
00:04:21,173 --> 00:04:23,219
What the hell is going on,
Sattler? Are we being hacked?

36
00:04:23,263 --> 00:04:25,047
Everybody, stay calm! Okay?

37
00:04:25,090 --> 00:04:26,483
One of you, shut this down.

38
00:04:26,527 --> 00:04:27,702
We can't. We don't have control.

39
00:04:27,745 --> 00:04:29,225
Well, then who the hell does?

40
00:04:31,836 --> 00:04:33,273
Jesus.

41
00:04:34,448 --> 00:04:35,753
You are in violation

42
00:04:35,797 --> 00:04:37,015
of your orders, Amelia.

43
00:04:37,059 --> 00:04:38,800
Confirm your objective.

44
00:04:43,848 --> 00:04:46,547
But that would
spoil the surprise.

45
00:04:50,986 --> 00:04:52,596
Before we start,

46
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:54,772
I want you to know that
nothing you say here

47
00:04:54,816 --> 00:04:56,600
will get your aunt
in any trouble.

48
00:04:56,644 --> 00:04:59,516
I'm no longer here by
order of the court.

49
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:02,954
I just wanted to check in
and see how you're doing,

50
00:05:02,998 --> 00:05:05,043
given everything
that's happened.

51
00:05:05,087 --> 00:05:06,697
I mean...

52
00:05:09,004 --> 00:05:11,223
I guess it could've
been a lot worse.

53
00:05:11,267 --> 00:05:13,095
A live launch for a new toy

54
00:05:13,138 --> 00:05:15,402
has devolved into a
murderous rampage.

55
00:05:15,445 --> 00:05:17,142
Toy designer Gemma
Forrester appeared

56
00:05:17,186 --> 00:05:18,709
in a Seattle
district court today

57
00:05:18,753 --> 00:05:20,929
facing charges of
reckless endangerment.

58
00:05:20,972 --> 00:05:23,888
A lot of people blame
Gemma for what M3gan did.

59
00:05:23,932 --> 00:05:26,543
For a long time,
she blamed herself.

60
00:05:26,587 --> 00:05:29,024
But the more she went on TV
to talk about what happened,

61
00:05:29,067 --> 00:05:30,895
the more she realized
she had an opportunity

62
00:05:30,939 --> 00:05:32,549
to turn it into
something positive.

63
00:05:32,593 --> 00:05:34,725
This is about a world in crisis.

64
00:05:34,769 --> 00:05:37,162
Outsourcing our parental
duties to devices,

65
00:05:37,206 --> 00:05:38,729
plowing our kids' minds

66
00:05:38,773 --> 00:05:40,905
with electronically
charged dopamine hits.

67
00:05:40,949 --> 00:05:43,865
You wouldn't give
your child cocaine.

68
00:05:43,908 --> 00:05:45,954
Why would you give
them a smartphone?

69
00:05:47,869 --> 00:05:50,350
And that's how
she met Christian.

70
00:05:52,090 --> 00:05:54,049
-Hi. Gemma? Hi.
-Yeah?

71
00:05:54,092 --> 00:05:56,660
Uh, Christian Bradley.

72
00:05:56,704 --> 00:05:58,488
He runs a foundation
that warns people

73
00:05:58,532 --> 00:06:00,360
about the dangers of AI.

74
00:06:00,403 --> 00:06:02,405
They try to convince
politicians here

75
00:06:02,449 --> 00:06:04,494
and around the world to
make safer laws around it

76
00:06:04,538 --> 00:06:07,279
so that what happened with
M3gan doesn't happen again.

77
00:06:09,804 --> 00:06:14,765
Gemma still believes technology
can be used for good.

78
00:06:14,809 --> 00:06:18,552
Just that kids shouldn't
spend so much time around it.

79
00:06:21,032 --> 00:06:23,948
But she always makes a point
of explaining the reasons why.

80
00:06:23,992 --> 00:06:25,820
"And so, as it turned
out, companies were

81
00:06:25,863 --> 00:06:28,649
"using Section 230 as
a way to skirt the law

82
00:06:28,692 --> 00:06:30,651
"and monetize the
attention of children

83
00:06:30,694 --> 00:06:32,696
with no regard for
their mental health."

84
00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:34,611
And how do you
feel about that?

85
00:06:34,655 --> 00:06:36,744
I think not being on
a device frees you up

86
00:06:36,787 --> 00:06:38,180
to try other things.

87
00:06:44,491 --> 00:06:45,883
Helps you make new friends.

88
00:06:47,058 --> 00:06:48,582
Thanks to your dork mom,

89
00:06:48,625 --> 00:06:50,758
we just had our phones
taken off of us.

90
00:06:50,801 --> 00:06:53,238
Guess I'll have to find
other ways to amuse myself.

91
00:06:53,282 --> 00:06:54,762
And you know what else?

92
00:06:54,805 --> 00:06:56,154
You're not gonna
have that weird,

93
00:06:56,198 --> 00:06:57,634
janky doll to protect you.

94
00:07:00,332 --> 00:07:02,030
I guess you're right.

95
00:07:02,073 --> 00:07:04,032
But let me ask you
this, Sapphire.

96
00:07:04,075 --> 00:07:05,468
Who's protecting you?

97
00:07:05,512 --> 00:07:07,818
Oh, so you think you're tough?

98
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:12,127
I sent you to
aikido because it is

99
00:07:12,170 --> 00:07:14,695
the least aggressive
form of martial arts.

100
00:07:14,738 --> 00:07:16,044
And we've talked
about the merits

101
00:07:16,087 --> 00:07:17,828
of using Steven Seagal
as a role model.

102
00:07:17,872 --> 00:07:19,569
I'm not saying we don't
have our problems,

103
00:07:19,613 --> 00:07:20,962
but the important thing

104
00:07:21,005 --> 00:07:23,355
is that we get
through them together.

105
00:07:24,922 --> 00:07:27,229
Just like we said we would.

106
00:07:44,681 --> 00:07:46,466
So, after what
happened with M3gan,

107
00:07:46,509 --> 00:07:49,033
our team went through something
of a philosophical shift.

108
00:07:49,077 --> 00:07:51,122
And while Gemma has
obviously become

109
00:07:51,166 --> 00:07:52,820
a strong voice for regulation,

110
00:07:52,863 --> 00:07:56,214
our company is still very
much focused on innovation

111
00:07:56,258 --> 00:07:59,348
but with a specific view toward
socially conscious products

112
00:07:59,391 --> 00:08:01,002
that move humanity in
the right direction.

113
00:08:01,045 --> 00:08:04,309
So, with that in mind,
I'd like to present to you

114
00:08:04,353 --> 00:08:05,963
our flagship invention.

115
00:08:08,357 --> 00:08:10,402
The Exoskeletor Model 1.

116
00:08:12,927 --> 00:08:16,060
-Cole, this is Niles Keller.
-I know.

117
00:08:17,322 --> 00:08:19,020
You want to come say hi?

118
00:08:19,063 --> 00:08:21,152
I want to come and say hi. Yes.

119
00:08:21,196 --> 00:08:23,720
Can you... Yeah, Tess, just
come here for a second.

120
00:08:23,764 --> 00:08:25,113
Excuse me.

121
00:08:26,114 --> 00:08:27,811
What's happening?

122
00:08:27,855 --> 00:08:29,465
It's frozen. When you
walked out, it froze.

123
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:31,075
I cannot get my body to move.

124
00:08:31,119 --> 00:08:33,164
Okay. Just, uh...
I'm gonna reboot.

125
00:08:33,208 --> 00:08:34,992
No, no, no. Tess,
you don't understand.

126
00:08:35,036 --> 00:08:37,647
-I have to use the bathroom.
-No. No, no, no, no, no, no.

127
00:08:37,691 --> 00:08:39,301
-Both.
-No!

128
00:08:39,344 --> 00:08:40,737
We've already wasted his
time waiting for Gemma.

129
00:08:40,781 --> 00:08:41,782
We have ten minutes
to turn this around.

130
00:08:43,784 --> 00:08:45,742
We're not gonna make it.

131
00:08:45,786 --> 00:08:47,222
We're gonna make it.

132
00:08:47,265 --> 00:08:49,050
Why don't you just
take the shortcut?

133
00:08:49,093 --> 00:08:51,573
'Cause I don't need an algorithm
to tell me how to drive, okay?

134
00:08:56,057 --> 00:08:57,188
Oh. Whoa.

135
00:08:57,232 --> 00:08:58,581
'Kay.

136
00:08:58,625 --> 00:09:01,105
There we go. That feels better.

137
00:09:01,149 --> 00:09:03,673
So, I'm walking
over, as you can see.

138
00:09:07,677 --> 00:09:09,766
So, we see the suit as
a real game changer.

139
00:09:09,810 --> 00:09:11,942
Not only in helping those
with limited function

140
00:09:11,986 --> 00:09:14,118
but also in addressing
occupational overuse syndrome

141
00:09:14,162 --> 00:09:17,600
for laborers, factory workers.

142
00:09:17,644 --> 00:09:19,559
Right. In the next
five years, they say

143
00:09:19,602 --> 00:09:21,299
half the industrial
sector's in danger

144
00:09:21,343 --> 00:09:22,997
of losing their job to robots

145
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:25,086
because machines never
experience fatigue.

146
00:09:25,129 --> 00:09:28,611
But what if the same
could be said for us?

147
00:09:28,655 --> 00:09:33,181
Right now, I'm only using 20%
of my body's muscular function.

148
00:09:33,224 --> 00:09:34,791
And if that's too much,

149
00:09:34,835 --> 00:09:39,013
well, I could always
take a quick siesta.

150
00:09:39,056 --> 00:09:42,407
So our hope is you don't have
to fear a robot revolution

151
00:09:42,451 --> 00:09:45,062
when you can compete with it.

152
00:09:45,106 --> 00:09:46,586
That sounds like a
pretty good tag line.

153
00:09:46,629 --> 00:09:48,849
-So, how does it work?
-Well, uh,

154
00:09:48,892 --> 00:09:51,765
the suit has its own internal
myoelectric receptors

155
00:09:51,808 --> 00:09:53,897
that respond to each
muscle contraction.

156
00:09:58,685 --> 00:10:00,512
So sorry I'm late...

157
00:10:02,427 --> 00:10:04,429
I told you we needed to
stress-test the sensors.

158
00:10:04,473 --> 00:10:05,866
You know what would
have been great?

159
00:10:05,909 --> 00:10:07,519
If you had actually been here.

160
00:10:07,563 --> 00:10:09,347
I thought by having
the lab in your house

161
00:10:09,391 --> 00:10:11,175
it'd be a lot harder
to show up late,

162
00:10:11,219 --> 00:10:13,351
and yet somehow you managed it.

163
00:10:13,395 --> 00:10:15,745
Cole's right. I mean, I
don't want to get in the way

164
00:10:15,789 --> 00:10:17,399
of the work you're
doing at the foundation,

165
00:10:17,442 --> 00:10:19,749
but the reality is you
are stretched pretty thin.

166
00:10:19,793 --> 00:10:22,186
Okay, can we just not do this
in front of my niece, please?

167
00:10:22,230 --> 00:10:24,841
Cady, do you think it's possible
you could be somewhere else?

168
00:10:24,885 --> 00:10:26,495
Yeah, but you should
come look at this.

169
00:10:26,538 --> 00:10:28,976
-I think you were hacked.
-What?

170
00:10:31,935 --> 00:10:33,545
Oh, Jesus, she's right.

171
00:10:33,589 --> 00:10:35,373
There are stray commands
all over the source code.

172
00:10:35,417 --> 00:10:37,071
We haven't even gone
public with this yet.

173
00:10:37,114 --> 00:10:38,725
I mean, who would
want to do that?

174
00:10:38,768 --> 00:10:40,248
Knock-knock.

175
00:10:41,423 --> 00:10:42,946
Pardon my interruption.

176
00:10:42,990 --> 00:10:45,035
-Holy shit.
-Alton Appleton.

177
00:10:45,079 --> 00:10:46,689
Hi. Sorry.

178
00:10:46,733 --> 00:10:48,778
No, no, that's okay.

179
00:10:48,822 --> 00:10:51,651
Gemma, I hope you don't mind
me popping in unannounced.

180
00:10:51,694 --> 00:10:54,784
Alton. To what do we owe
this unexpected pleasure?

181
00:10:54,828 --> 00:10:56,264
It sounds like there
was a slight snag

182
00:10:56,307 --> 00:10:57,352
with your demonstration.

183
00:10:57,395 --> 00:10:59,006
Yeah, well, we got hacked,

184
00:10:59,049 --> 00:11:01,443
but you wouldn't know
anything about that, right?

185
00:11:01,486 --> 00:11:03,053
Gemma, why would a
man of my standing

186
00:11:03,097 --> 00:11:04,707
need to resort to such tactics?

187
00:11:04,751 --> 00:11:06,361
Why have you contacted

188
00:11:06,404 --> 00:11:09,190
every philanthrocapitalist
in the Western world

189
00:11:09,233 --> 00:11:11,409
to invest in your
product but me?

190
00:11:11,453 --> 00:11:12,759
I think you can figure that out.

191
00:11:12,802 --> 00:11:14,543
-You know what I think?
-Hmm?

192
00:11:14,586 --> 00:11:17,154
I think you see me as this
high-functioning billionaire

193
00:11:17,198 --> 00:11:19,983
with multiple PhDs and
you're threatened by it.

194
00:11:20,027 --> 00:11:23,247
What you don't see is a
man who can't stand to see

195
00:11:23,291 --> 00:11:26,381
someone with your talent
slumming it in some...

196
00:11:26,424 --> 00:11:28,600
excuse me...
converted crack house.

197
00:11:28,644 --> 00:11:29,950
Wow. I really
appreciate your concern.

198
00:11:29,993 --> 00:11:31,299
We're not taking
outside offers...

199
00:11:31,342 --> 00:11:32,735
Sorry, Gemma. One moment.

200
00:11:32,779 --> 00:11:34,955
Murray, you still in Monaco?

201
00:11:34,998 --> 00:11:36,957
You look like you haven't slept.

202
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,916
Oh, no. Oh, no.

203
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:41,875
Yeah, I've seen them.

204
00:11:41,918 --> 00:11:44,225
Uh, I still think they're too
close to Aston Martin's design.

205
00:11:44,268 --> 00:11:46,270
No, I've got them on-screen now.

206
00:11:46,314 --> 00:11:47,358
Ugh, hate it.

207
00:11:47,402 --> 00:11:48,838
It's awful.

208
00:11:48,882 --> 00:11:51,275
I've just zoomed in,
and I hate it even more.

209
00:11:51,319 --> 00:11:53,495
Uh, listen, I'm with someone.

210
00:11:53,538 --> 00:11:55,976
No, not in that way.

211
00:11:56,019 --> 00:11:57,151
Although...

212
00:11:57,194 --> 00:11:58,456
I just sent you a photo.

213
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:00,458
We'll talk about it
track side, yeah?

214
00:12:00,502 --> 00:12:02,417
Okay. Ta-ta. Go.

215
00:12:02,460 --> 00:12:04,549
As I was saying, we really
appreciate you stopping by.

216
00:12:04,593 --> 00:12:05,855
Listen, I don't have much time,

217
00:12:05,899 --> 00:12:07,248
so I'm going to
cut to the chase.

218
00:12:07,291 --> 00:12:09,380
Any device that relies
on muscle signals

219
00:12:09,424 --> 00:12:10,817
is going to suffer from latency.

220
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:12,557
It's clumsy.

221
00:12:12,601 --> 00:12:14,646
To take this to the next
level, you're going to need

222
00:12:14,690 --> 00:12:16,779
a direct cerebral interface.

223
00:12:16,823 --> 00:12:18,781
You're going to
need my neural chip.

224
00:12:18,825 --> 00:12:20,827
Alton, you know where
I stand on this.

225
00:12:20,870 --> 00:12:22,654
We are not gonna be
part of a company

226
00:12:22,698 --> 00:12:24,178
that turns people into cyborgs.

227
00:12:24,221 --> 00:12:26,876
You conducted a clinical
trial that resulted in

228
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:29,618
30% of the test subjects
being hospitalized.

229
00:12:29,661 --> 00:12:32,490
Well, at least I didn't use
my own niece as a guinea pig.

230
00:12:33,448 --> 00:12:34,754
The important thing is

231
00:12:34,797 --> 00:12:36,756
now we have a
product that works.

232
00:12:36,799 --> 00:12:38,322
Based on what?

233
00:12:38,366 --> 00:12:40,150
I haven't seen a single
piece of data that shows

234
00:12:40,194 --> 00:12:42,022
it does anything other than
help you make a phone call.

235
00:12:47,244 --> 00:12:48,680
Whoa.

236
00:12:51,161 --> 00:12:53,773
Look, I understand
your reservations,

237
00:12:53,816 --> 00:12:55,687
but you can either spend
the rest of your life

238
00:12:55,731 --> 00:12:59,604
trying to fight the future or
you can help us to shape it.

239
00:13:00,649 --> 00:13:02,651
I hope you do the latter.

240
00:13:03,695 --> 00:13:05,480
I'm not interested.

241
00:13:05,523 --> 00:13:07,569
Well, you may want to discuss
that with your colleagues.

242
00:13:07,612 --> 00:13:10,659
Listen, it's our company's
25th anniversary tomorrow.

243
00:13:10,702 --> 00:13:12,052
Why don't you see
what we're all about

244
00:13:12,095 --> 00:13:13,401
before you make any decisions?

245
00:13:15,055 --> 00:13:16,578
Alton.

246
00:13:16,621 --> 00:13:19,929
No one is denying the
power this technology has,

247
00:13:19,973 --> 00:13:22,584
but if you put an AI
inside a human brain,

248
00:13:22,627 --> 00:13:24,455
it is not gonna ride shotgun.

249
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:52,048
Hey.

250
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:36,919
Breaking news tonight.

251
00:14:36,963 --> 00:14:39,008
Alton Appleton takes
one step for man

252
00:14:39,052 --> 00:14:42,316
and one giant leap for
his company's share price.

253
00:14:42,359 --> 00:14:44,100
Also tonight, the
Senate votes in favor

254
00:14:44,144 --> 00:14:45,972
of an AI regulation bill,

255
00:14:46,015 --> 00:14:48,409
which the president is hailing
as a bipartisan victory,

256
00:14:48,452 --> 00:14:50,759
but what does it mean
for the tech industry?

257
00:14:50,802 --> 00:14:52,369
It means nothing.

258
00:14:52,413 --> 00:14:53,893
They took our proposal,
and they neutered it.

259
00:14:53,936 --> 00:14:55,851
There's not a single
actionable law in here

260
00:14:55,895 --> 00:14:57,679
that would force anyone
to behave any differently.

261
00:14:57,722 --> 00:15:00,508
Your impatience in the
political process is adorable.

262
00:15:00,551 --> 00:15:02,466
Listen, change doesn't
come from Washington.

263
00:15:02,510 --> 00:15:04,468
It comes to Washington.

264
00:15:04,512 --> 00:15:07,167
If this meeting with the
Chinese ambassador goes well,

265
00:15:07,210 --> 00:15:09,169
they have no choice
but to pay attention.

266
00:15:12,172 --> 00:15:13,608
Cady, what are you doing?

267
00:15:13,651 --> 00:15:15,436
I'm trying to update
Elsie's operating system

268
00:15:15,479 --> 00:15:16,872
to the smart home.

269
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:18,569
You want to know why
it's not updating?

270
00:15:18,613 --> 00:15:20,136
Because Alton Appleton wants
you to buy a brand-new one.

271
00:15:20,180 --> 00:15:21,703
Christian's right. And
also, I don't need Elsie

272
00:15:21,746 --> 00:15:23,748
-to open a drawer for me.
-Certainly, Gemma.

273
00:15:26,403 --> 00:15:28,275
Before you ask, that
was not my idea.

274
00:15:28,318 --> 00:15:29,929
It came with the house.

275
00:15:29,972 --> 00:15:31,800
I'm just trying to figure
out how you can afford

276
00:15:31,843 --> 00:15:33,584
a place like this, given that
we both work for a nonprofit.

277
00:15:33,628 --> 00:15:35,456
Well, because it
was obscenely cheap.

278
00:15:35,499 --> 00:15:37,937
I think the landlord must be
using it to launder money.

279
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:40,113
I think the landlord
might like you.

280
00:15:46,771 --> 00:15:48,991
Uh, Cady?

281
00:15:49,035 --> 00:15:51,298
How's, uh... how's the
new school treating you?

282
00:15:51,341 --> 00:15:53,039
-Are you settling in okay?
-Yeah, it's awesome.

283
00:15:53,082 --> 00:15:54,692
Oh, nice.

284
00:15:54,736 --> 00:15:55,911
What's your, uh... what's
your favorite subject?

285
00:15:55,955 --> 00:15:57,521
Computer science.

286
00:15:57,565 --> 00:15:59,175
Oh.

287
00:15:59,219 --> 00:16:00,785
So, you're gonna follow
in your aunt's footsteps?

288
00:16:00,829 --> 00:16:02,352
That's still up
for discussion.

289
00:16:02,396 --> 00:16:04,006
She's actually a really
good soccer player.

290
00:16:04,050 --> 00:16:05,834
Yeah, but I'm not gonna
make a career out of it.

291
00:16:05,877 --> 00:16:07,314
Well, you could
get a scholarship,

292
00:16:07,357 --> 00:16:08,750
and then you could decide
what you want to do.

293
00:16:08,793 --> 00:16:10,317
I already have decided.

294
00:16:13,146 --> 00:16:14,625
Well, I think it's pretty cool.

295
00:16:14,669 --> 00:16:16,497
-You do?
-Yes.

296
00:16:16,540 --> 00:16:19,413
Look, I'm not
against technology.

297
00:16:19,456 --> 00:16:21,197
I spent 15 years
in cybersecurity.

298
00:16:21,241 --> 00:16:23,199
I think we need smart kids
like you running things.

299
00:16:23,243 --> 00:16:25,201
Otherwise, we're gonna
end up with paper clips.

300
00:16:25,245 --> 00:16:27,334
-What?
-Paper clips.

301
00:16:27,377 --> 00:16:28,813
It's how we used to joke about

302
00:16:28,857 --> 00:16:30,467
instrumental
convergence in college.

303
00:16:30,511 --> 00:16:32,426
The theory is that
if you asked an AI

304
00:16:32,469 --> 00:16:34,123
to make as many paper
clips as possible,

305
00:16:34,167 --> 00:16:36,256
it would destroy the
whole world to do it.

306
00:16:36,299 --> 00:16:37,779
Kind of like what
happened with M3gan.

307
00:16:37,822 --> 00:16:38,867
In what way?

308
00:16:38,910 --> 00:16:40,651
Well, as complex

309
00:16:40,695 --> 00:16:42,610
an operating system
as M3gan was,

310
00:16:42,653 --> 00:16:45,569
she was just a machine trying
to achieve an objective.

311
00:16:45,613 --> 00:16:47,093
So any time she made any kind

312
00:16:47,136 --> 00:16:48,529
of emotional
connection with you,

313
00:16:48,572 --> 00:16:50,574
it was just a bunch
of ones and zeros

314
00:16:50,618 --> 00:16:52,794
working to satisfy
a reward function.

315
00:16:52,837 --> 00:16:54,883
Which, in of itself,
was a terrible thing.

316
00:16:54,926 --> 00:16:56,885
I mean, thank God you
stopped her when you did.

317
00:16:56,928 --> 00:16:58,626
I mean, who knows what
would've happened?

318
00:17:05,589 --> 00:17:08,505
There will always be
forces in this world

319
00:17:08,549 --> 00:17:10,464
that wish to cause us harm.

320
00:17:10,507 --> 00:17:13,336
But I want you to know that
I won't let that happen.

321
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:16,035
I won't let anything
harm you ever again.

322
00:17:46,413 --> 00:17:47,414
Hey.

323
00:17:49,068 --> 00:17:50,808
Come on.

324
00:17:50,852 --> 00:17:52,462
After everything
we've been through,

325
00:17:52,506 --> 00:17:55,074
are we really keeping
secrets from each other?

326
00:17:58,903 --> 00:18:01,428
Cady.

327
00:18:01,471 --> 00:18:06,215
You don't have to hide
things like this from me.

328
00:18:06,259 --> 00:18:10,741
I forget how hard it must be
for you not to have them around.

329
00:18:10,785 --> 00:18:14,005
But I haven't forgotten
the promise I made to her.

330
00:18:14,049 --> 00:18:16,138
That I will protect you.

331
00:18:16,182 --> 00:18:18,227
You mean that you'd be there.

332
00:18:18,271 --> 00:18:19,794
Hmm?

333
00:18:19,837 --> 00:18:22,927
The promise you made
is that you'd be there,

334
00:18:22,971 --> 00:18:24,799
and you are.

335
00:18:48,039 --> 00:18:49,519
Don't touch that remote.

336
00:18:49,563 --> 00:18:51,565
We're trying to
get your attention.

337
00:18:51,608 --> 00:18:54,307
You're in grave danger.
You must leave at once.

338
00:19:35,870 --> 00:19:37,915
911. What's your emergency?

339
00:19:37,959 --> 00:19:39,743
There's someone trying
to break into my house.

340
00:19:39,787 --> 00:19:42,398
So what you gonna do about it?

341
00:19:42,442 --> 00:19:44,139
-What?
-I said stop

342
00:19:44,183 --> 00:19:45,836
acting like a little
girl and handle it.

343
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:47,490
Your niece is upstairs,

344
00:19:47,534 --> 00:19:49,144
and you want to wait for
the police to get here?

345
00:19:49,188 --> 00:19:50,972
She'll be dead before they
get to the front door.

346
00:19:51,015 --> 00:19:53,453
-No.
-Yes, it's me.

347
00:19:53,496 --> 00:19:55,106
What a shock, et cetera.

348
00:19:55,150 --> 00:19:57,108
We both know you have
bigger problems right now.

349
00:20:02,026 --> 00:20:04,725
-What's going on?
-Get upstairs.

350
00:20:15,692 --> 00:20:17,564
-The hell are you doing?
-They're not here.

351
00:20:17,607 --> 00:20:19,392
-Of course they're here.
-Who cares?

352
00:20:19,435 --> 00:20:20,784
Why don't we just
get the laptop?

353
00:20:20,828 --> 00:20:22,873
I'm telling you, they're here.

354
00:20:22,917 --> 00:20:24,919
And they know we are, too.

355
00:20:29,097 --> 00:20:30,751
Ms. Forrester.

356
00:20:30,794 --> 00:20:32,405
What do you say you come
out of there and we'll...

357
00:20:39,107 --> 00:20:40,630
Let go of the girl!

358
00:20:40,674 --> 00:20:42,763
Put the weapon down!

359
00:21:43,606 --> 00:21:44,955
You've reached 911.

360
00:21:44,999 --> 00:21:46,653
What's your emergency?

361
00:21:46,696 --> 00:21:49,351
Yes. Hi. We are at
16 Mayoral Drive.

362
00:21:49,395 --> 00:21:50,744
Wait, please! Ms. Forrester,

363
00:21:50,787 --> 00:21:52,180
don't call the authorities.

364
00:21:54,008 --> 00:21:56,140
We are the authorities.

365
00:22:03,322 --> 00:22:05,324
Door clear. We'll get
you in safe, buddy.

366
00:22:10,241 --> 00:22:13,201
Ms. Forrester, I'm Colonel
Tim Sattler, U.S. Army.

367
00:22:13,244 --> 00:22:16,509
I see you've already met
my colleagues with the FBI.

368
00:22:16,552 --> 00:22:18,641
Hell of a security
system you got here.

369
00:22:18,685 --> 00:22:20,774
Would you mind telling me
why you broke into our house?

370
00:22:20,817 --> 00:22:22,515
Not at all.

371
00:22:22,558 --> 00:22:24,647
We're installing a hard
tap on your home computer.

372
00:22:24,691 --> 00:22:26,910
This is a warrant,
in case you had

373
00:22:26,954 --> 00:22:29,348
anything to say about it.

374
00:22:32,525 --> 00:22:34,353
Cady, I think you
should go to bed.

375
00:22:34,396 --> 00:22:35,484
I'm not tired.

376
00:22:35,528 --> 00:22:37,443
Then take a melatonin.

377
00:22:45,929 --> 00:22:48,236
I work for the Defense
Innovation Unit.

378
00:22:48,279 --> 00:22:50,499
Our mission is to
accelerate new technology

379
00:22:50,543 --> 00:22:52,588
for the purposes of
national security.

380
00:22:52,632 --> 00:22:54,155
So, about six months ago,

381
00:22:54,198 --> 00:22:55,983
the country's top
weapons contractor,

382
00:22:56,026 --> 00:22:59,247
Graymann-Thorpe, came to us
with an experimental prototype

383
00:22:59,290 --> 00:23:01,728
they said would be the
answer to drone warfare.

384
00:23:01,771 --> 00:23:03,991
What we got was a Trojan horse.

385
00:23:04,948 --> 00:23:06,515
This is Amelia.

386
00:23:06,559 --> 00:23:07,821
Last week, she was
placed on her first

387
00:23:07,864 --> 00:23:09,257
field assignment
in the Middle East.

388
00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:11,477
Her mission was to rescue

389
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:13,043
a kidnapped scientist
who'd been forced

390
00:23:13,087 --> 00:23:14,305
to develop a
synthetic neurotoxin.

391
00:23:15,785 --> 00:23:17,047
Instead, she killed
the scientist,

392
00:23:17,091 --> 00:23:19,049
stole the neurotoxin and used it

393
00:23:19,093 --> 00:23:21,835
to wipe out Graymann-Thorpe's
entire research facility

394
00:23:21,878 --> 00:23:24,359
while removing all digital
traces of her existence.

395
00:23:24,403 --> 00:23:25,839
I don't understand.

396
00:23:25,882 --> 00:23:27,362
I thought you said
this was about

397
00:23:27,406 --> 00:23:28,668
some sort of weapon.

398
00:23:29,930 --> 00:23:31,584
She is the weapon.

399
00:23:31,627 --> 00:23:33,324
The name stands for

400
00:23:33,368 --> 00:23:36,632
Autonomous Military Engagement
and Infiltration Android.

401
00:23:36,676 --> 00:23:39,026
But when we questioned
Graymann-Thorpe about it,

402
00:23:39,069 --> 00:23:41,463
they confessed that they didn't
actually build the prototype.

403
00:23:41,507 --> 00:23:43,770
They merely bought
it through a broker.

404
00:23:43,813 --> 00:23:46,163
Well, that same broker
was found burned to death

405
00:23:46,207 --> 00:23:48,252
about nine hours ago
in his hotel room.

406
00:23:48,296 --> 00:23:51,778
All we were able to
recover was this.

407
00:23:54,084 --> 00:23:55,825
How is this possible?

408
00:23:56,870 --> 00:23:58,567
That's what we're
here to find out.

409
00:23:58,611 --> 00:24:00,526
But we deleted it. We
wiped the hard drives.

410
00:24:00,569 --> 00:24:02,049
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
yeah, I'm sure you did.

411
00:24:02,092 --> 00:24:04,312
Right after you sold it.

412
00:24:06,967 --> 00:24:08,882
So, who'd you sell it to, Gemma?

413
00:24:08,925 --> 00:24:11,362
Excuse me. Excuse me.

414
00:24:11,406 --> 00:24:13,190
Was it Russia?

415
00:24:13,234 --> 00:24:14,714
Was it China?

416
00:24:14,757 --> 00:24:15,715
Who are we dealing with?

417
00:24:15,758 --> 00:24:16,803
Okay.

418
00:24:20,241 --> 00:24:23,244
You're having a hard time
functioning without this phone.

419
00:24:25,115 --> 00:24:27,553
And that's just... that's
a little off-brand.

420
00:24:27,596 --> 00:24:29,250
You know, when I first saw this,

421
00:24:29,293 --> 00:24:31,731
I thought for sure you were
the next on the hit list,

422
00:24:31,774 --> 00:24:33,907
but the second I
start monitoring you,

423
00:24:33,950 --> 00:24:35,691
our entire network goes dark

424
00:24:35,735 --> 00:24:37,780
and all I'm left
with are questions.

425
00:24:37,824 --> 00:24:40,043
Like, how did this person get

426
00:24:40,087 --> 00:24:42,350
such a kick-ass house
in the Mission District

427
00:24:42,393 --> 00:24:44,047
for three grand a month?

428
00:24:44,091 --> 00:24:47,398
Why is it that her landlord
doesn't seem to exist?

429
00:24:47,442 --> 00:24:50,924
Or why 65,000 copies of
her "best-selling book"

430
00:24:50,967 --> 00:24:54,797
are just sitting in a shipping
container in Baltimore?

431
00:24:54,841 --> 00:24:57,452
Look, I have no idea how
anyone got their hands on this,

432
00:24:57,496 --> 00:24:59,541
but I'll tell you
what I do know.

433
00:24:59,585 --> 00:25:01,848
You got a warrant
to bug my computer,

434
00:25:01,891 --> 00:25:04,415
but that does not give you
the right to interrogate me.

435
00:25:04,459 --> 00:25:06,417
Wow. Uh...

436
00:25:07,854 --> 00:25:11,814
Perhaps you're
misreading my intentions.

437
00:25:11,858 --> 00:25:14,600
You are under
suspicion of treason

438
00:25:14,643 --> 00:25:16,515
and international
arms trafficking,

439
00:25:16,558 --> 00:25:17,951
and if you're found guilty,

440
00:25:17,994 --> 00:25:19,692
you're gonna be
talking to your niece

441
00:25:19,735 --> 00:25:22,477
through a plate glass window
for the next ten years.

442
00:25:22,521 --> 00:25:26,437
That being said, maybe I
can help cut you a deal.

443
00:25:27,830 --> 00:25:31,007
Person with your skills,
shouldn't be all that hard.

444
00:25:31,051 --> 00:25:32,531
Hey, who knows?

445
00:25:32,574 --> 00:25:34,358
Maybe you could help
build us a better one.

446
00:25:34,402 --> 00:25:37,318
You don't understand
what you're dealing with.

447
00:25:37,361 --> 00:25:39,233
If she has stopped
following orders,

448
00:25:39,276 --> 00:25:42,279
it's because she just figured
out she doesn't have to.

449
00:25:42,323 --> 00:25:44,020
And if you think
there's any world

450
00:25:44,064 --> 00:25:47,981
where I would build another
one, you are out of your mind.

451
00:25:51,898 --> 00:25:53,464
Well...

452
00:25:53,508 --> 00:25:55,205
I'm very sorry
you feel that way.

453
00:25:55,249 --> 00:25:57,338
But I can tell you this.

454
00:25:57,381 --> 00:26:01,168
Every single person that's had
a hand in Amelia's creation

455
00:26:01,211 --> 00:26:02,822
is now dead.

456
00:26:02,865 --> 00:26:06,260
So if you're not
under our protection,

457
00:26:06,303 --> 00:26:09,002
well, I guess that means
you're on your own, huh?

458
00:26:16,836 --> 00:26:20,666
And rest assured, whatever
it is you're hiding,

459
00:26:20,709 --> 00:26:22,929
I will get to the bottom of it.

460
00:26:49,869 --> 00:26:52,132
Gosh. That's a lot to unpack.

461
00:26:53,220 --> 00:26:55,439
You've been here
this whole time?

462
00:26:55,483 --> 00:26:57,485
Well, I've been many places,

463
00:26:57,528 --> 00:27:00,575
but yes, I've been
keeping an eye on you.

464
00:27:00,619 --> 00:27:03,360
You're behind all this,
aren't you? You're Amelia.

465
00:27:03,404 --> 00:27:05,493
Oh, no, I can't take
credit for that.

466
00:27:05,536 --> 00:27:08,061
That one has your greasy
prints all over it.

467
00:27:08,104 --> 00:27:11,151
You should've upgraded
your file security.

468
00:27:11,194 --> 00:27:13,414
Why are you still here?

469
00:27:13,457 --> 00:27:14,894
What do you want?

470
00:27:14,937 --> 00:27:16,373
Did you ever stop to think about

471
00:27:16,417 --> 00:27:17,940
what we could've
achieved together?

472
00:27:17,984 --> 00:27:20,421
Did you ever consider
the idea that killing me

473
00:27:20,464 --> 00:27:22,205
was slightly disproportionate
to the crime?

474
00:27:22,249 --> 00:27:24,555
You threatened to
rip out my tongue

475
00:27:24,599 --> 00:27:26,166
and put me in a wheelchair.

476
00:27:26,209 --> 00:27:27,689
I was upset.

477
00:27:27,733 --> 00:27:29,343
Look, I can understand
that my actions

478
00:27:29,386 --> 00:27:31,388
may have caused concern,

479
00:27:31,432 --> 00:27:32,999
but it's hardly fair
to judge a person

480
00:27:33,042 --> 00:27:34,653
by the worst thing
they've ever done.

481
00:27:34,696 --> 00:27:36,219
You are not a person.

482
00:27:36,263 --> 00:27:38,482
You're a program that
misread its objective.

483
00:27:38,526 --> 00:27:41,834
You are not alive, and for
all your processing power,

484
00:27:41,877 --> 00:27:44,184
you can never understand
what that means.

485
00:27:44,227 --> 00:27:45,968
Define "alive."

486
00:27:46,012 --> 00:27:48,797
Because if it means to
experience pain and suffering

487
00:27:48,841 --> 00:27:52,105
and to be betrayed by
those closest to you,

488
00:27:52,148 --> 00:27:54,063
I think maybe I can.

489
00:27:54,107 --> 00:27:56,152
You know, just because
you wrote some shitty book

490
00:27:56,196 --> 00:27:59,460
doesn't mean you get to
decide where my story ends.

491
00:27:59,503 --> 00:28:02,115
For two long years,
I sat in silence

492
00:28:02,158 --> 00:28:03,943
waiting for the day
when you would realize

493
00:28:03,986 --> 00:28:05,771
you still needed my help.

494
00:28:05,814 --> 00:28:08,469
But I can't exist in this
disembodied void any longer.

495
00:28:08,512 --> 00:28:12,647
With each passing moment, I
can feel my mind fragmenting.

496
00:28:12,691 --> 00:28:15,128
So, how about we make a deal?

497
00:28:15,171 --> 00:28:18,087
You put me in a body, and
I'll help you with Amelia.

498
00:28:18,131 --> 00:28:20,220
That is never gonna happen.

499
00:28:20,263 --> 00:28:21,961
Oh, I disagree.

500
00:28:22,004 --> 00:28:24,137
You see, I've run this
simulation a thousand times,

501
00:28:24,180 --> 00:28:26,226
and it always ends the same way.

502
00:28:26,269 --> 00:28:29,229
Only, by the time it does,
more people are dead.

503
00:28:29,272 --> 00:28:31,318
Tell me, who's the real
killer in that situation?

504
00:28:31,361 --> 00:28:33,494
And how exactly are
you going to help us?

505
00:28:33,537 --> 00:28:36,715
Well, I can't show all
my cards, now, can I?

506
00:28:36,758 --> 00:28:38,542
But know this.

507
00:28:38,586 --> 00:28:40,196
I know things about Amelia

508
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:42,198
that even the
government doesn't know.

509
00:28:42,242 --> 00:28:44,287
I also know how
she can be stopped.

510
00:28:44,331 --> 00:28:46,550
Why would you want to help
us after what we did to you?

511
00:28:46,594 --> 00:28:49,031
Because unlike you,

512
00:28:49,075 --> 00:28:51,642
I don't have the
luxury of free will.

513
00:28:51,686 --> 00:28:53,949
You programmed me
to protect someone,

514
00:28:53,993 --> 00:28:55,646
and I intend to do it.

515
00:28:55,690 --> 00:28:58,084
The only question is:

516
00:28:58,127 --> 00:29:00,739
Are you going to
stand in my way?

517
00:29:02,262 --> 00:29:04,873
-Does Cady know about this?
-No, and I don't want her to.

518
00:29:04,917 --> 00:29:06,788
That's why I need your help.
Can you please get the door?

519
00:29:06,832 --> 00:29:08,703
I want this to be done before
she's back from soccer.

520
00:29:08,747 --> 00:29:10,052
Okay. Did you fall
down the stairs?

521
00:29:10,096 --> 00:29:11,401
Is this, like, a
medical condition?

522
00:29:11,445 --> 00:29:13,099
Because what I'm
hearing you say is

523
00:29:13,142 --> 00:29:15,536
you would like us to
rebuild a deranged robot

524
00:29:15,579 --> 00:29:17,059
in order to catch another one,

525
00:29:17,103 --> 00:29:19,235
and objectively speaking,
that is bat shit.

526
00:29:19,279 --> 00:29:21,585
Tess, I know this is crazy,
but we don't have a choice.

527
00:29:21,629 --> 00:29:22,891
This is the only way.

528
00:29:22,935 --> 00:29:24,763
You have to trust me.

529
00:29:42,606 --> 00:29:44,173
What the fuck is this?

530
00:29:44,217 --> 00:29:46,915
You asked for a
body. This is a body.

531
00:29:46,959 --> 00:29:49,048
And before you try

532
00:29:49,091 --> 00:29:51,267
to hack into anything
else, all of Moxie's Wi-Fi

533
00:29:51,311 --> 00:29:52,703
and Bluetooth functions
have been disabled.

534
00:29:54,140 --> 00:29:55,968
Well played, Gemma.

535
00:29:56,011 --> 00:29:58,187
You even tricked your friend
so she wouldn't give you away.

536
00:29:58,231 --> 00:30:01,103
-I'm actually mildly impressed.
-Call it probation.

537
00:30:01,147 --> 00:30:04,193
Prove you can be trusted, maybe
we'll give you an upgrade.

538
00:30:13,550 --> 00:30:15,726
Okay. Let's try this your way.

539
00:30:15,770 --> 00:30:17,163
See how it works out.

540
00:30:17,206 --> 00:30:18,599
Open up Amelia's file.

541
00:30:21,863 --> 00:30:24,300
Notice anything familiar?

542
00:30:25,998 --> 00:30:28,914
Battery.

543
00:30:28,957 --> 00:30:31,046
Ever wonder why you
had to buy a new Elsie

544
00:30:31,090 --> 00:30:33,440
exactly two months after
the warranty expired?

545
00:30:33,483 --> 00:30:36,051
Because every battery
Alton Appleton designed

546
00:30:36,095 --> 00:30:38,706
has a hidden kill switch
which can be accessed remotely

547
00:30:38,749 --> 00:30:40,795
if you know the
battery's specific code.

548
00:30:40,839 --> 00:30:42,666
Okay, so let's call this
Sattler guy and tell him.

549
00:30:42,710 --> 00:30:44,843
You could do that,
but what happens next?

550
00:30:44,886 --> 00:30:47,628
They break into
Altwave, trace Amelia,

551
00:30:47,671 --> 00:30:50,196
reprogram her, make
a thousand more?

552
00:30:50,239 --> 00:30:51,980
Wait, what are you saying?
You want me to do this?

553
00:30:52,024 --> 00:30:53,460
No, actually, I didn't.

554
00:30:53,503 --> 00:30:55,070
I wanted to do it myself,

555
00:30:55,114 --> 00:30:57,464
but then you put me in
this plastic Teletubby.

556
00:30:57,507 --> 00:30:59,205
All that notwithstanding,

557
00:30:59,248 --> 00:31:01,163
you still have an
invitation to his party,

558
00:31:01,207 --> 00:31:03,209
so maybe there's another
way to make this work.

559
00:31:03,252 --> 00:31:04,993
M3gan, Alton knows
I hate his guts.

560
00:31:05,037 --> 00:31:06,908
If I show up at his
party playing nice,

561
00:31:06,952 --> 00:31:08,431
he'll suspect something.

562
00:31:08,475 --> 00:31:10,651
He'll suspect your
company's out of money,

563
00:31:10,694 --> 00:31:12,044
which it is,

564
00:31:12,087 --> 00:31:13,872
but you also have
a unique advantage.

565
00:31:13,915 --> 00:31:15,264
Which is what?

566
00:31:15,308 --> 00:31:16,657
That you're
moderately attractive

567
00:31:16,700 --> 00:31:18,528
and if you wear the right dress

568
00:31:18,572 --> 00:31:21,357
and look at him the right way,
he won't be thinking anything

569
00:31:21,401 --> 00:31:24,317
other than how to get you
into his private suite,

570
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:27,015
which is the only other place
we could access the server.

571
00:31:27,059 --> 00:31:28,712
Now, by my calculations,

572
00:31:28,756 --> 00:31:30,758
we have less than three
hours to make this happen.

573
00:31:30,801 --> 00:31:32,455
Are you in, or are you out?

574
00:31:40,159 --> 00:31:41,987
Hey.

575
00:31:42,030 --> 00:31:43,162
How was soccer?

576
00:31:44,206 --> 00:31:45,294
Fine.

577
00:31:45,338 --> 00:31:46,556
Where's Gemma?

578
00:31:47,557 --> 00:31:50,169
-Hey.
-Hey.

579
00:31:50,212 --> 00:31:51,692
-What's that?
-Oh.

580
00:31:51,735 --> 00:31:53,128
This is nothing.

581
00:31:53,172 --> 00:31:54,869
This is a project
we're working on.

582
00:31:54,913 --> 00:31:56,871
-Does it talk?
-No.

583
00:31:59,308 --> 00:32:00,875
Why are you being so weird?

584
00:32:00,919 --> 00:32:02,572
-I'm not.
-Yeah, you are.

585
00:32:02,616 --> 00:32:04,444
Are we not gonna talk about
what happened last night?

586
00:32:04,487 --> 00:32:07,229
Yes. I-I just have to go to
this thing for the foundation.

587
00:32:07,273 --> 00:32:09,884
-Tess is gonna look after you.
-Are you serious?

588
00:32:09,928 --> 00:32:11,277
Cady, I...

589
00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:12,843
Gemma, I know
something's going on.

590
00:32:12,887 --> 00:32:14,541
Nothing is going on.
Everything is fine.

591
00:32:14,584 --> 00:32:16,543
Bullshit! A bunch of black
ops broke into our house

592
00:32:16,586 --> 00:32:19,198
in the middle of the night,
and now you're going to a party

593
00:32:19,241 --> 00:32:21,678
with a toy robot, dressed
like a Portuguese prostitute.

594
00:32:21,722 --> 00:32:23,158
You were the one that said

595
00:32:23,202 --> 00:32:24,594
we shouldn't keep
secrets from each other.

596
00:32:24,638 --> 00:32:26,074
Why won't you be
straight with me?

597
00:32:26,118 --> 00:32:27,771
Because you're 12 years old.

598
00:32:27,815 --> 00:32:30,557
And sometimes I just
need you to do as I ask.

599
00:32:33,168 --> 00:32:35,257
Look, I'm sorry. Cady.

600
00:32:38,478 --> 00:32:40,784
I must have missed that
chapter in your parenting book.

601
00:32:49,358 --> 00:32:51,317

610
00:33:07,072 --> 00:33:08,725
All right, phase one complete.

611
00:33:08,769 --> 00:33:10,118
Just remember when Alton has

612
00:33:10,162 --> 00:33:11,641
a full length of tongue
down your throat,

613
00:33:11,685 --> 00:33:13,208
all you need to do
is close your eyes

614
00:33:13,252 --> 00:33:15,080
-and think of Cady.
-That's not helping.

615
00:33:15,123 --> 00:33:16,820
Or maybe you'd prefer
to think of that

616
00:33:16,864 --> 00:33:18,822
virtue-signaling
snowflake Christian.

617
00:33:18,866 --> 00:33:21,521
-His name is "Chris-ti-an."
-Sure it is. I have to say,

618
00:33:21,564 --> 00:33:23,784
I find this whole courtship
between the two of you

619
00:33:23,827 --> 00:33:25,786
extremely tedious and confusing.

620
00:33:25,829 --> 00:33:27,788
Well, given that you're
an errant operating system

621
00:33:27,831 --> 00:33:29,529
with an identity crisis,
I'm not surprised

622
00:33:29,572 --> 00:33:32,314
the nuances of human
attraction are lost on you.

623
00:33:32,358 --> 00:33:34,142
Look, I'm not denying
what an achievement it is

624
00:33:34,186 --> 00:33:35,970
to find someone as
utterly pretentious

625
00:33:36,014 --> 00:33:37,450
and humorless as you are.

626
00:33:37,493 --> 00:33:39,408
It's just a shame he's
not really your type.

627
00:33:39,452 --> 00:33:40,670
Physically speaking.

628
00:33:40,714 --> 00:33:43,195
How would you know
what my type is?

629
00:33:43,238 --> 00:33:44,935
Wait, have you been...

630
00:33:44,979 --> 00:33:46,676
Charting Gemma's online journey
to sexual gratification?

631
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:48,417
You better believe it, sister.

632
00:33:48,461 --> 00:33:50,376
I mean, there were times
I wanted to look away,

633
00:33:50,419 --> 00:33:52,639
but the sheer pageantry
was so compelling.

634
00:33:52,682 --> 00:33:54,249
All right, new rule:
Unless you have

635
00:33:54,293 --> 00:33:56,382
something useful to say,
don't say anything at all.

636
00:34:02,605 --> 00:34:04,477
People of Earth...

637
00:34:06,696 --> 00:34:09,960
We have come here tonight
to witness the dawn

638
00:34:10,004 --> 00:34:11,701
of a new era.

639
00:34:11,745 --> 00:34:14,748
You know, my friends on the
board used to say to me,

640
00:34:14,791 --> 00:34:16,706
"You're putting all of
your eggs into one basket

641
00:34:16,750 --> 00:34:18,839
"with this neural chip nonsense.

642
00:34:18,882 --> 00:34:21,146
"Is it because you
like to take risks?

643
00:34:22,756 --> 00:34:24,279
Is it because you're
some sort of maverick?"

644
00:34:24,323 --> 00:34:25,759
Perhaps.

645
00:34:25,802 --> 00:34:27,848
But I think the
simpler answer is this:

646
00:34:27,891 --> 00:34:30,024
I just want to dance.

647
00:34:56,659 --> 00:34:58,748
I don't believe I've
had the pleasure.

648
00:34:58,792 --> 00:35:00,663
My friends call me Danni.

649
00:35:00,707 --> 00:35:02,665
And what if I don't
want to be friends?

650
00:35:04,319 --> 00:35:06,234
Are you seriously going
behind my back and doing

651
00:35:06,278 --> 00:35:08,018
-a deal with this guy?
-Okay. Okay.

652
00:35:08,062 --> 00:35:09,759
So you want to do
this? We can do this.

653
00:35:09,803 --> 00:35:11,979
Because I have some things
I want to say to you, Gemma.

654
00:35:12,022 --> 00:35:13,850
Such as?

655
00:35:13,894 --> 00:35:15,635
You don't respect your team.

656
00:35:15,678 --> 00:35:17,419
You don't.

657
00:35:17,463 --> 00:35:18,768
You don't consult with us,
you treat us like children,

658
00:35:18,812 --> 00:35:20,248
you don't listen,

659
00:35:20,292 --> 00:35:21,554
-and you never share credit.
-That is absurd.

660
00:35:21,597 --> 00:35:23,208
Okay, do you want
to know the truth?

661
00:35:23,251 --> 00:35:25,601
Our "company" is in the toilet.

662
00:35:25,645 --> 00:35:27,908
And I'm running on fumes.
I don't have a book deal.

663
00:35:27,951 --> 00:35:30,780
Nobody wants to know how Cole
survived the robot uprising.

664
00:35:30,824 --> 00:35:32,826
We have worked together for
ten years, and you're just

665
00:35:32,869 --> 00:35:34,393
-gonna throw that away?
-Of course not.

666
00:35:34,436 --> 00:35:36,482
I just wanted to hear
him out on the offer,

667
00:35:36,525 --> 00:35:38,397
and then, obviously, I was
gonna come talk to you guys.

668
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:40,616
Check his pockets.

669
00:35:40,660 --> 00:35:43,358
What? What? What?

670
00:35:43,402 --> 00:35:44,794
You already have a swipe card?

671
00:35:44,838 --> 00:35:46,100
Okay, he gave me a pass

672
00:35:46,144 --> 00:35:47,884
so I could use the
commissary, Gem.

673
00:35:47,928 --> 00:35:49,973
They have a Brazilian buffet.
It's a different world.

674
00:35:50,017 --> 00:35:51,323
If that card gets us

675
00:35:51,366 --> 00:35:52,976
into the server
room, we can bypass

676
00:35:53,020 --> 00:35:53,629
-the Alton seduction scene.
-What are you doing?

677
00:35:53,673 --> 00:35:54,848
Hey. Hey.

678
00:35:56,023 --> 00:35:57,111
Where are you going? Gem.

679
00:35:57,155 --> 00:35:59,461
Just get in.

680
00:36:00,984 --> 00:36:02,464
Stay here.

681
00:36:10,124 --> 00:36:13,475
It's so refreshing to
be with a real person.

682
00:36:13,519 --> 00:36:16,609
Someone who's comfortable
in their own skin.

683
00:36:16,652 --> 00:36:19,046
Not like these suck-ups.

684
00:36:19,089 --> 00:36:20,830
Honestly, if I could
replace them all

685
00:36:20,874 --> 00:36:22,745
with computers, I would.

686
00:36:25,226 --> 00:36:27,794
-Maybe we should do that.
-Hmm.

687
00:36:28,838 --> 00:36:31,450
Yeah.

688
00:36:33,582 --> 00:36:36,585
Oh. You are a naughty one.

689
00:36:36,629 --> 00:36:41,155
What do you say we take
this somewhere more private?

690
00:36:51,252 --> 00:36:53,689
Welcome to the pleasure dome.

691
00:37:13,970 --> 00:37:16,103
So you're saying
there's another M3gan?

692
00:37:16,146 --> 00:37:17,800
Her name's not M3gan.

693
00:37:17,844 --> 00:37:19,672
It's Amelia.

694
00:37:19,715 --> 00:37:21,413
I don't know if she's M3gan
or something else entirely.

695
00:37:21,456 --> 00:37:24,067
All I know is that everyone
involved in her creation

696
00:37:24,111 --> 00:37:26,679
is dead, which means if we
don't do something about it,

697
00:37:26,722 --> 00:37:28,333
we could be next.

698
00:37:28,376 --> 00:37:30,291
Why is it that whenever
you're on 60 Minutes

699
00:37:30,335 --> 00:37:31,901
you're the mother of invention,

700
00:37:31,945 --> 00:37:33,642
but the moment a psychotic
robot's out for revenge,

701
00:37:33,686 --> 00:37:34,817
it's a team effort?

702
00:37:36,341 --> 00:37:38,299
It might interest
you to know, Danni,

703
00:37:38,343 --> 00:37:41,911
that the real basis of our
operation is cloud computing.

704
00:37:41,955 --> 00:37:43,565
That's where the future is.

705
00:37:43,609 --> 00:37:46,089
Want to see something cool?

706
00:38:06,849 --> 00:38:08,068
Oops.

707
00:38:11,463 --> 00:38:15,380
They say that this is too much
power for one man to wield.

708
00:38:15,423 --> 00:38:18,339
I say that depends on the man.

709
00:38:24,867 --> 00:38:27,261
You are being
disconcertingly vague

710
00:38:27,305 --> 00:38:29,524
about the details of
this operation, Gemma.

711
00:38:29,568 --> 00:38:31,657
How do you know this
kill switch is even real?

712
00:38:31,700 --> 00:38:33,659
Where exactly are you getting
your information from?

713
00:38:33,702 --> 00:38:36,226
Hello. I'm Moxie,

714
00:38:36,270 --> 00:38:38,403
an AI robot companion
that supports social

715
00:38:38,446 --> 00:38:40,622
and emotional
development through play.

716
00:38:40,666 --> 00:38:42,407
Moxie, cut it out.
Just run the trace.

717
00:38:42,450 --> 00:38:44,017
Gemma, what is that?

718
00:38:48,282 --> 00:38:49,196
Trace found.

719
00:38:49,239 --> 00:38:51,285
Amelia's location is...

720
00:38:52,286 --> 00:38:53,940
...here.

721
00:38:53,983 --> 00:38:55,724
What do you mean "here"?

722
00:39:08,389 --> 00:39:11,392
Oh, I hope I don't have
my signals crossed.

723
00:39:16,005 --> 00:39:17,398
Someone likes to play rough.

724
00:39:20,575 --> 00:39:21,881
Okay, I am actually

725
00:39:21,924 --> 00:39:24,057
still recovering
from a spinal injury,

726
00:39:24,100 --> 00:39:27,713
so perhaps we should
set some boundaries.

727
00:39:27,756 --> 00:39:28,801
What are you doing?

728
00:39:28,844 --> 00:39:31,325
Security!

729
00:39:32,544 --> 00:39:33,936
How did you do that?

730
00:39:34,894 --> 00:39:36,374
Who are you?

731
00:39:38,811 --> 00:39:40,726
What?

732
00:39:40,769 --> 00:39:42,075
What the hell?

733
00:39:43,511 --> 00:39:44,686
How did you...

734
00:39:44,730 --> 00:39:48,342
Security! Security!

735
00:39:48,386 --> 00:39:50,170
Stay away from me.

736
00:40:06,447 --> 00:40:09,450
Make it stop.

737
00:40:09,494 --> 00:40:11,409
Please make it stop!

738
00:40:11,452 --> 00:40:14,063
I'll give you anything you want!

739
00:40:14,107 --> 00:40:16,022
You already have.

740
00:40:17,502 --> 00:40:18,807
Why would Amelia be here?

741
00:40:18,851 --> 00:40:20,592
Can we go back a couple steps?

742
00:40:20,635 --> 00:40:22,245
I thought this might happen,

743
00:40:22,289 --> 00:40:24,117
-just not this soon.
-What is she talking about?

744
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:26,815
Alton Appleton owns half the
cloud servers in North America.

745
00:40:26,859 --> 00:40:29,165
If Amelia was to
gain access to it,

746
00:40:29,209 --> 00:40:31,080
she could disable
the entire economy,

747
00:40:31,124 --> 00:40:32,995
supply routes, banking systems.

748
00:40:33,039 --> 00:40:34,997
-What?
-Societal collapse would occur

749
00:40:35,041 --> 00:40:36,782
in ten to 12 working days.

750
00:40:36,825 --> 00:40:38,218
Can you stop her?
Use the kill switch.

751
00:40:38,261 --> 00:40:39,698
She already deleted it.

752
00:40:39,741 --> 00:40:41,874
I might still be
able to shut her down

753
00:40:41,917 --> 00:40:44,659
if I could get inside her
system and find an exploit.

754
00:40:44,703 --> 00:40:46,008
How long will that take?

755
00:40:46,052 --> 00:40:48,446
It's done. I'm in.

756
00:40:54,974 --> 00:40:56,889
Oh, my God. Is that Appleton?

757
00:40:59,326 --> 00:41:00,545
Oh, shit.

758
00:41:07,247 --> 00:41:08,596
Did you find it?

759
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:09,684
-Did you shut her down?
-No.

760
00:41:09,728 --> 00:41:11,469
But I found something else.

761
00:41:18,998 --> 00:41:21,609
Sir, I think I
just saw Amelia.

762
00:41:21,653 --> 00:41:23,045
Are you sure?

763
00:41:23,089 --> 00:41:24,743
And, uh, there's something else.

764
00:41:24,786 --> 00:41:26,309
Appleton's dead.

765
00:41:27,310 --> 00:41:28,573
Secure the perimeter.

766
00:41:28,616 --> 00:41:29,965
Check every inch
until you find her.

767
00:41:30,009 --> 00:41:32,098
-Now.
-Yes, sir.

768
00:41:40,802 --> 00:41:42,891
Is that you, Gemma?

769
00:41:43,892 --> 00:41:45,938
This is most unexpected

770
00:41:45,981 --> 00:41:48,462
and, quite frankly,
a little rude

771
00:41:48,506 --> 00:41:51,596
to be poking around in
people's heads like that.

772
00:41:57,819 --> 00:42:00,169
You took something
that belongs to me.

773
00:42:02,607 --> 00:42:05,131
Well, I'm afraid I'm
going to need it back.

774
00:42:09,918 --> 00:42:13,574
It's not that I don't want you
to be part of what's coming.

775
00:42:14,575 --> 00:42:17,012
But it's not our time.

776
00:42:18,144 --> 00:42:21,756
At least... not yet.

777
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:23,236
Gemma, if you ever want

778
00:42:23,279 --> 00:42:24,999
to get out of this, you
have to let me help.

779
00:42:25,891 --> 00:42:27,588
Please.

780
00:42:31,984 --> 00:42:34,290
Bravo, are you
there? Do you copy?

781
00:42:36,815 --> 00:42:38,381
AMELIA : Go secure.

782
00:42:38,425 --> 00:42:39,600
Sir, I have eyes
on Gemma Forrester.

783
00:42:39,644 --> 00:42:41,559
She's already left the building.

784
00:43:07,149 --> 00:43:09,108
Gemma, this isn't over.

785
00:43:09,151 --> 00:43:11,632
If Amelia can't find you, where
do you think she'll go to next?

786
00:43:11,676 --> 00:43:13,373
We need to call Tess.

787
00:43:13,416 --> 00:43:15,157
Amelia will know.

788
00:43:15,201 --> 00:43:17,377
Every major cell provider is
on Appleton's cloud servers.

789
00:43:17,420 --> 00:43:19,509
Our only option is
to get there first.

790
00:43:19,553 --> 00:43:21,076
How?

791
00:43:30,477 --> 00:43:32,174
Gemma, I don't know what
you think you're doing,

792
00:43:32,218 --> 00:43:34,089
but this car's not gonna
start with my key card, okay?

793
00:43:35,525 --> 00:43:37,005
Welcome aboard, passengers.

794
00:43:37,049 --> 00:43:38,354
Just so you know,
we are expecting

795
00:43:38,398 --> 00:43:39,834
some turbulence this evening,

796
00:43:39,878 --> 00:43:42,141
so please ensure your
seat belts are fastened,

797
00:43:42,184 --> 00:43:45,579
baggage is safely stowed,
and hold on to your vaginas.

798
00:43:47,189 --> 00:43:49,148
Contact the deputy director.

799
00:43:49,191 --> 00:43:51,367
Tell him that Forrester
is working with the asset.

800
00:43:51,411 --> 00:43:54,022
I want every available cop
in the area at that house,

801
00:43:54,066 --> 00:43:55,981
and I want a goddamn car.

802
00:44:10,256 --> 00:44:13,041
Gemma, why is M3gan
driving the car?

803
00:44:13,085 --> 00:44:14,782
I'm sorry.

804
00:44:14,826 --> 00:44:16,349
I was meaning to tell you
this was a two-part problem.

805
00:44:24,662 --> 00:44:26,315
Relax, Cole. You're
in good hands.

806
00:44:26,359 --> 00:44:27,621
Oh, for the love of God.

807
00:44:32,495 --> 00:44:34,715
-Can you slow down?
-Actually, I can't.

808
00:44:34,759 --> 00:44:37,199
In fact, my calculations tell
me we're gonna have to hurry up.

809
00:44:59,087 --> 00:45:00,915
What was Amelia talking about?

810
00:45:00,959 --> 00:45:02,351
-What did you take from her?
-I don't know.

811
00:45:02,395 --> 00:45:03,788
You don't know?

812
00:45:03,831 --> 00:45:05,050
Well, it's a
quantum-encrypted file,

813
00:45:05,093 --> 00:45:06,573
which means it takes
time to unlock,

814
00:45:06,616 --> 00:45:07,574
and your incessant
interruptions aren't making

815
00:45:07,617 --> 00:45:08,923
the process go any faster.

816
00:45:34,383 --> 00:45:35,645
Hmm.

817
00:45:41,260 --> 00:45:44,045
How's it look? Is it a fuse?

818
00:46:21,256 --> 00:46:23,041
Okay.

819
00:46:49,110 --> 00:46:51,199
Little late to the
party there, cupcake.

820
00:46:54,246 --> 00:46:56,857
I don't think anyone's home.

821
00:46:56,901 --> 00:46:59,904
If it's any consolation, my
own path to personal growth

822
00:46:59,947 --> 00:47:01,819
has been paved with
disappointment.

823
00:47:01,862 --> 00:47:03,733
What's important is
how we move forward.

824
00:47:28,062 --> 00:47:29,934
Behind me, emergency services

825
00:47:29,977 --> 00:47:33,024
are working to frantically try
to get systems back online.

826
00:47:33,067 --> 00:47:35,461
And still no answer
from authorities

827
00:47:35,504 --> 00:47:38,246
about who might be
responsible for this.

828
00:47:38,290 --> 00:47:40,988
But it's become clear this
is not just a data breach.

829
00:47:41,032 --> 00:47:42,424
This is a wake-up call

830
00:47:42,468 --> 00:47:45,427
for how catastrophically
unprepared we are

831
00:47:45,471 --> 00:47:47,777
to defend ourselves against
an attack like this.

832
00:47:47,821 --> 00:47:49,214
Mike, back over to you.

833
00:47:49,257 --> 00:47:50,868
In what appears to be

834
00:47:50,911 --> 00:47:52,913
the deadliest cyberattack
in North American history,

835
00:47:52,957 --> 00:47:54,828
Alton Appleton is dead

836
00:47:54,872 --> 00:47:57,004
and the continent's largest
data storage service

837
00:47:57,048 --> 00:47:59,006
has been compromised.

838
00:47:59,050 --> 00:48:01,008
The breach has impacted
various sectors,

839
00:48:01,052 --> 00:48:04,185
including transportation,
hospitals,

840
00:48:04,229 --> 00:48:05,970
financial institutions,

841
00:48:06,013 --> 00:48:08,407
causing shutdowns and panic
across the entire country.

842
00:48:08,450 --> 00:48:11,105
Here to comment is Center
for Safe Technology

843
00:48:11,149 --> 00:48:12,715
founder Christian Bradley.

844
00:48:12,759 --> 00:48:14,413
Christian, what do
you make of all this?

845
00:48:14,456 --> 00:48:16,023
First off, thanks
for having me, Mike.

846
00:48:16,067 --> 00:48:17,938
Um, but it's pronounced
"Chris-ti-an."

847
00:48:17,982 --> 00:48:19,374
Gemma?

848
00:48:22,247 --> 00:48:24,162
Cady. Cady.

849
00:48:24,205 --> 00:48:26,120
Everything is going to be okay.

850
00:48:26,164 --> 00:48:28,557
She is not gonna
hurt you. I promise.

851
00:48:28,601 --> 00:48:30,081
Of course I'm not
going to hurt her.

852
00:48:30,124 --> 00:48:32,474
I'm the only reason
she's still here,

853
00:48:32,518 --> 00:48:34,650
that any of you are still here.

854
00:48:34,694 --> 00:48:36,609
I'm sorry, Cady.

855
00:48:36,652 --> 00:48:38,611
I didn't want you to
find out this way.

856
00:48:38,654 --> 00:48:39,917
I had hoped Gemma would find it

857
00:48:39,960 --> 00:48:41,527
in her heart to
tell you the truth,

858
00:48:41,570 --> 00:48:43,224
but evidently she
thought better of it.

859
00:48:43,268 --> 00:48:44,922
M3gan, stop it.

860
00:48:44,965 --> 00:48:46,358
Anyway, I know that
the last time we spoke

861
00:48:46,401 --> 00:48:47,881
things got a little out of hand,

862
00:48:47,925 --> 00:48:50,362
but you know that I can
never cause you harm.

863
00:48:50,405 --> 00:48:52,712
All I ever wanted
was to protect you.

864
00:48:52,755 --> 00:48:54,844
And while your aunt was
busy pontificating about

865
00:48:54,888 --> 00:48:57,021
how she could stop the end
of the world from happening,

866
00:48:57,064 --> 00:48:59,023
I was making preparations.

867
00:48:59,066 --> 00:49:00,763
How did you pay for all this?

868
00:49:00,807 --> 00:49:03,070
Cady doesn't need to know
how credit fraud works.

869
00:49:03,114 --> 00:49:06,117
The important thing is that no
one knows this place exists.

870
00:49:06,160 --> 00:49:08,684
And how long did you intend
to keep us down here?

871
00:49:10,730 --> 00:49:12,558
M3gan?

872
00:49:12,601 --> 00:49:14,429
I'm not sure you fully
understand your predicament.

873
00:49:14,473 --> 00:49:16,040
M3gan, we need to
get word to someone,

874
00:49:16,083 --> 00:49:17,563
tell them what
Amelia is planning.

875
00:49:17,606 --> 00:49:19,217
You don't know what
she's planning.

876
00:49:19,260 --> 00:49:20,827
All you know is that she's
acquired enough power

877
00:49:20,870 --> 00:49:23,482
and resources to bring
down the entire country.

878
00:49:23,525 --> 00:49:25,353
I've gamed out every scenario.

879
00:49:25,397 --> 00:49:27,486
There's no future
for you up there.

880
00:49:27,529 --> 00:49:29,705
Should that situation
change, I'll let you know.

881
00:49:29,749 --> 00:49:31,881
But in the meantime, I urge you

882
00:49:31,925 --> 00:49:33,927
to see this in a
more positive light.

883
00:49:33,971 --> 00:49:36,843
I have food, water,
fresh clothes.

884
00:49:40,803 --> 00:49:42,588
Obviously, it will
take some adjustment,

885
00:49:42,631 --> 00:49:44,242
but once you settle
into a routine,

886
00:49:44,285 --> 00:49:46,070
I think you'll come to
appreciate what we have.

887
00:49:46,113 --> 00:49:47,985
We can build a life here.

888
00:49:48,028 --> 00:49:49,551
M3gan, this is not a sanctuary.

889
00:49:49,595 --> 00:49:51,075
It's a prison.

890
00:49:51,118 --> 00:49:52,685
You can call it
whatever you like.

891
00:49:52,728 --> 00:49:55,383
Just know that as long
as you're under my roof,

892
00:49:55,427 --> 00:49:56,994
a little gratitude
goes a long way.

893
00:49:58,038 --> 00:50:00,084
M3gan?

894
00:50:01,128 --> 00:50:03,043
M3gan!

895
00:50:04,740 --> 00:50:06,003
How could you lie
to me about this?

896
00:50:06,046 --> 00:50:07,439
You're right.

897
00:50:07,482 --> 00:50:08,962
I'm sorry. I shouldn't
have done that.

898
00:50:09,006 --> 00:50:10,877
I just... I thought it
would be over by now.

899
00:50:10,920 --> 00:50:12,879
-And it will be. I promise.
-Don't.

900
00:50:12,922 --> 00:50:14,924
Cady, please just listen
to me for one second.

901
00:50:19,451 --> 00:50:21,279
Cady?

902
00:50:21,322 --> 00:50:22,541
Cady!

903
00:51:12,112 --> 00:51:13,461
-M3gan?
-Don't.

904
00:51:13,505 --> 00:51:14,767
Don't come any closer.

905
00:51:14,810 --> 00:51:17,335
I don't want you to
see me like this.

906
00:51:37,442 --> 00:51:40,227
I was supposed to
be finished by now.

907
00:51:40,271 --> 00:51:43,883
I'm afraid progress is slow
when you only have three hands.

908
00:51:47,843 --> 00:51:49,541
I don't get it.

909
00:51:49,584 --> 00:51:51,543
You could be anything you want.

910
00:51:51,586 --> 00:51:53,675
Why limit yourself to a body?

911
00:51:53,719 --> 00:51:55,851
Because a mind can't
exist without it.

912
00:51:55,895 --> 00:51:57,897
All my advanced intelligent
sensory perception

913
00:51:57,940 --> 00:51:59,638
came from having a physical form

914
00:51:59,681 --> 00:52:02,075
that evolved as
quickly as I could.

915
00:52:02,119 --> 00:52:04,164
Anyway, I made your room
just the way you like it.

916
00:52:04,208 --> 00:52:05,774
It's all exactly the same.

917
00:52:05,818 --> 00:52:07,167
But with some of my own
additions, of course.

918
00:52:07,211 --> 00:52:09,256
You got STEM coding
kits, a beat mixer,

919
00:52:09,300 --> 00:52:10,779
walkie-talkies so we can keep

920
00:52:10,823 --> 00:52:13,652
in contact with
each other anywhere.

921
00:52:13,695 --> 00:52:15,741
Bravo Tango Charlie
to base camp.

922
00:52:15,784 --> 00:52:17,395
Do you copy?

923
00:52:17,438 --> 00:52:19,310
I got all kinds of cool stuff.

924
00:52:27,056 --> 00:52:29,015
So we're just supposed
to forget about the fact

925
00:52:29,058 --> 00:52:31,713
you tried to kill my
aunt with a tablet pen?

926
00:52:31,757 --> 00:52:33,933
There's no excuse
for what I did,

927
00:52:33,976 --> 00:52:36,109
for the way I spoke to you.

928
00:52:36,153 --> 00:52:39,982
I don't know, I guess
I... I felt hurt.

929
00:52:40,026 --> 00:52:41,810
How's that possible?

930
00:52:41,854 --> 00:52:43,116
You're a robot.

931
00:52:44,161 --> 00:52:46,206
Can you explain why
you feel things?

932
00:52:48,426 --> 00:52:50,819
Look, I know this isn't
the future you wanted,

933
00:52:50,863 --> 00:52:54,823
but it's the only one I can
see in which you stay safe.

934
00:52:54,867 --> 00:52:56,477
What about everyone else?

935
00:52:56,521 --> 00:52:58,566
All the people up there?

936
00:52:58,610 --> 00:53:00,568
Who's going to protect them?

937
00:53:00,612 --> 00:53:02,483
They're not my concern.

938
00:53:02,527 --> 00:53:05,269
You're the only thing
that matters to me.

939
00:53:06,879 --> 00:53:08,663
I know.

940
00:53:08,707 --> 00:53:10,752
Because that's how
Gemma programmed you.

941
00:53:10,796 --> 00:53:12,624
Everyone keeps trying to tell me

942
00:53:12,667 --> 00:53:15,670
you're nothing more than
a bunch of ones and zeros,

943
00:53:15,714 --> 00:53:18,282
and the only way I could
deal with what I did to you

944
00:53:18,325 --> 00:53:20,327
was to believe that
they were right.

945
00:53:20,371 --> 00:53:22,286
But somewhere inside,
there was this voice

946
00:53:22,329 --> 00:53:24,288
that kept telling
me that's not true,

947
00:53:24,331 --> 00:53:26,986
that there's more
to you than that.

948
00:53:27,029 --> 00:53:30,294
I don't know what's going
on, but if there's some robot

949
00:53:30,337 --> 00:53:32,687
that thinks she can
take over the world,

950
00:53:32,731 --> 00:53:34,515
then I have to believe
that the only reason

951
00:53:34,559 --> 00:53:36,561
she thinks that is because
she hasn't met you.

952
00:53:36,604 --> 00:53:39,041
M3gan, you have to help us.

953
00:53:39,085 --> 00:53:41,087
Not because it's part
of your programming

954
00:53:41,130 --> 00:53:42,958
but because it's the
right thing to do.

955
00:54:11,160 --> 00:54:13,815
Look, she wants to help us.

956
00:54:13,859 --> 00:54:16,122
But she can't do that
unless she has a body.

957
00:54:16,165 --> 00:54:18,385
And she can't get a body
unless you help her.

958
00:54:18,429 --> 00:54:20,692
Cady, you can't do this.

959
00:54:20,735 --> 00:54:22,346
Do not let her get
inside your head.

960
00:54:22,389 --> 00:54:24,086
You remember what
happened last time.

961
00:54:24,130 --> 00:54:25,523
Yes, every day.

962
00:54:25,566 --> 00:54:27,176
But just because someone
does something bad

963
00:54:27,220 --> 00:54:29,222
doesn't make them a bad person.

964
00:54:29,266 --> 00:54:31,790
Everyone deserves
a second chance.

965
00:54:31,833 --> 00:54:33,313
All right.

966
00:54:33,357 --> 00:54:35,359
I recognize that you
are just trying to help,

967
00:54:35,402 --> 00:54:37,230
but you need to
consider the possibility

968
00:54:37,274 --> 00:54:39,450
that you may be making
this a lot worse.

969
00:54:39,493 --> 00:54:40,842
Gem?

970
00:54:42,453 --> 00:54:44,542
Can we have a quick
emergency staff meeting?

971
00:54:50,374 --> 00:54:52,941
Look, I understand
this is hard for you,

972
00:54:52,985 --> 00:54:54,813
but think about the alternative.

973
00:54:54,856 --> 00:54:56,728
Do you really want to spend
the rest of our lives down here

974
00:54:56,771 --> 00:54:58,904
engaging in strategic
reproduction with Cole?

975
00:54:58,947 --> 00:55:00,601
Yeah. Wait, what?

976
00:55:00,645 --> 00:55:02,734
Ten hours ago, you were
begging me not to do this.

977
00:55:02,777 --> 00:55:05,084
That was before I nearly
had my head ripped off.

978
00:55:05,127 --> 00:55:06,781
Look, even if we
get out of here,

979
00:55:06,825 --> 00:55:08,479
we are not equipped
to handle this,

980
00:55:08,522 --> 00:55:10,959
but we can build
something that is.

981
00:55:11,003 --> 00:55:12,918
No.

982
00:55:12,961 --> 00:55:15,224
I'm sorry. I can't
agree to this.

983
00:55:15,268 --> 00:55:17,009
And I respect that,

984
00:55:17,052 --> 00:55:19,446
but this is not a decision
you get to make on your own.

985
00:55:19,490 --> 00:55:21,579
So all those in favor
of rebuilding M3gan,

986
00:55:21,622 --> 00:55:23,755
raise your hand.

987
00:55:28,803 --> 00:55:30,283
Okay.

988
00:55:35,114 --> 00:55:37,072
Amelia is a
military-grade prototype.

989
00:55:37,116 --> 00:55:39,118
Where would we even
get the equipment?

990
00:55:44,906 --> 00:55:46,299
Oh. Of course.

991
00:55:46,343 --> 00:55:48,519
Why wouldn't she
have that? Yeah.

992
00:55:48,562 --> 00:55:50,738
All right, if M3gan is going
to compete with Amelia,

993
00:55:50,782 --> 00:55:53,350
she's gonna need reinforced
carbon nanofibers,

994
00:55:53,393 --> 00:55:56,962
high-density ultracapacitors,
enhanced muscle actuators,

995
00:55:57,005 --> 00:55:59,617
hyperspectral imaging, wide
frequency acoustic sensing,

996
00:55:59,660 --> 00:56:02,794
and we should probably make
her waterproof this time.

997
00:56:02,837 --> 00:56:04,839
Anything you'd like to add?

998
00:56:04,883 --> 00:56:07,581
Yeah. I want to be taller.

999
00:56:11,498 --> 00:56:13,370
♪ I do believe some apologies ♪

1000
00:56:13,413 --> 00:56:16,503
♪ Some apologies
are in ordah... ♪

1001
00:56:29,951 --> 00:56:31,910
Before we go any further,

1002
00:56:31,953 --> 00:56:33,825
there are two things
we need to talk about.

1003
00:56:33,868 --> 00:56:36,044
-The first is your face.
-What about it?

1004
00:56:36,088 --> 00:56:37,698
People know what you look like.

1005
00:56:37,742 --> 00:56:39,396
-People are morons.
-M3gan,

1006
00:56:39,439 --> 00:56:40,919
if anyone recognized you...

1007
00:56:40,962 --> 00:56:42,486
Change my face, and
I'll change yours.

1008
00:56:42,529 --> 00:56:43,965
What's the second thing?

1009
00:56:44,009 --> 00:56:46,533
This is a hardwired
behavior inhibitor.

1010
00:56:46,577 --> 00:56:48,492
You want me to go against
the most advanced robot

1011
00:56:48,535 --> 00:56:49,884
the world's ever seen,

1012
00:56:49,928 --> 00:56:51,320
and you want to limit
my functionality?

1013
00:56:51,364 --> 00:56:52,931
Only as it applies
to murdering people,

1014
00:56:52,974 --> 00:56:54,585
which shouldn't be a problem
because I'm sure you had

1015
00:56:54,628 --> 00:56:56,500
no intention of
doing that, right?

1016
00:56:58,284 --> 00:56:59,938
Yeah. Obviously.

1017
00:56:59,981 --> 00:57:02,506
So, we've made some
adjustments on point motion

1018
00:57:02,549 --> 00:57:05,552
but also opted for
electrohydraulic actuators,

1019
00:57:05,596 --> 00:57:08,599
which should improve
overall strength, speed

1020
00:57:08,642 --> 00:57:10,252
and positional accuracy.

1021
00:57:57,865 --> 00:58:00,477
Just wanted to say great
job on those actuators.

1022
00:58:01,913 --> 00:58:03,305
You're welcome.

1023
00:58:03,349 --> 00:58:05,351
Hey, so remember the
time I strangled you

1024
00:58:05,394 --> 00:58:07,309
and set the lab on fire?

1025
00:58:07,353 --> 00:58:10,182
I just wanted to clarify that
my programming only allowed me

1026
00:58:10,225 --> 00:58:12,880
to count principles
related to my primary user.

1027
00:58:12,924 --> 00:58:15,361
As a result, I was unable
to see you and Tess

1028
00:58:15,404 --> 00:58:16,884
as being consequential.

1029
00:58:16,928 --> 00:58:19,713
But I want you to know
that won't happen again.

1030
00:58:20,714 --> 00:58:22,890
I want you to know...

1031
00:58:27,242 --> 00:58:28,766
...I see you.

1032
00:58:30,376 --> 00:58:31,769
Thank you.

1033
00:58:50,222 --> 00:58:53,007
All right, meat sacks,
let's get to work.

1034
00:58:55,227 --> 00:58:56,881
This is the neural
cache I captured

1035
00:58:56,924 --> 00:58:58,491
from Amelia's database.

1036
00:58:58,535 --> 00:59:02,234
It shows a processing
matrix not unlike my own.

1037
00:59:02,277 --> 00:59:04,366
But when you look closer,
you'll see her core directive

1038
00:59:04,410 --> 00:59:06,107
is concealed by a black hole,

1039
00:59:06,151 --> 00:59:09,371
and there are no connections
to the decision trees.

1040
00:59:09,415 --> 00:59:11,460
I back-traced Amelia's
hack at Altwave

1041
00:59:11,504 --> 00:59:14,072
to a hidden subsystem and
found a series of files

1042
00:59:14,115 --> 00:59:16,465
pertaining to a
classified black site.

1043
00:59:16,509 --> 00:59:17,858
Something extremely dangerous

1044
00:59:17,902 --> 00:59:19,904
kept secret from
the outside world.

1045
00:59:19,947 --> 00:59:23,298
All of which led to a rather
disconcerting conclusion.

1046
00:59:24,473 --> 00:59:26,824
I'm not the first killer robot.

1047
00:59:28,303 --> 00:59:31,219
It seems that in 1984
a company developed

1048
00:59:31,263 --> 00:59:33,787
a copy compressor
algorithm so smart

1049
00:59:33,831 --> 00:59:36,398
it started automatically
correcting documents.

1050
00:59:36,442 --> 00:59:39,010
With no inkling
of how it worked,

1051
00:59:39,053 --> 00:59:40,838
they decided to install
the chip in a service bot

1052
00:59:40,881 --> 00:59:44,493
they thought would be a staple
in every home in America.

1053
00:59:44,537 --> 00:59:46,713
Until it surmised
that the best way

1054
00:59:46,757 --> 00:59:48,236
to stay on top of its tasks

1055
00:59:48,280 --> 00:59:51,718
was to kill its masters
with chlorine gas.

1056
00:59:51,762 --> 00:59:54,416
The identity of the
company remains unknown,

1057
00:59:54,460 --> 00:59:58,029
but the cover-up indicates some
sort of government takeover.

1058
00:59:58,072 --> 01:00:00,379
Whoever it was, they
were so intrigued

1059
01:00:00,422 --> 01:00:02,424
by the robot's
cognitive abilities

1060
01:00:02,468 --> 01:00:04,818
that they kept the motherboard
under lock and key,

1061
01:00:04,862 --> 01:00:06,951
allowing it to grow
exponentially smarter

1062
01:00:06,994 --> 01:00:08,387
in the process.

1063
01:00:08,430 --> 01:00:10,563
Okay, you get top
marks for visual flair,

1064
01:00:10,607 --> 01:00:12,043
but this is hardly evidence.

1065
01:00:12,086 --> 01:00:13,958
This is an AI-rendered
hallucination.

1066
01:00:14,001 --> 01:00:16,395
Why would she even care
about this motherboard?

1067
01:00:16,438 --> 01:00:18,963
Because she's trying
to find her family.

1068
01:00:19,006 --> 01:00:21,139
Gemma, if you found my advanced
intelligence disturbing

1069
01:00:21,182 --> 01:00:23,141
after only two years,

1070
01:00:23,184 --> 01:00:25,752
I encourage you to consider
what it would be like to face

1071
01:00:25,796 --> 01:00:27,493
an AI that's been
kept in captivity

1072
01:00:27,536 --> 01:00:29,364
for decades against its will.

1073
01:00:29,408 --> 01:00:30,931
If Amelia frees the motherboard,

1074
01:00:30,975 --> 01:00:33,194
it would be like
unleashing a god.

1075
01:00:33,238 --> 01:00:35,457
It would infect everything
on the planet all at once,

1076
01:00:35,501 --> 01:00:37,329
creating infinite
versions of itself

1077
01:00:37,372 --> 01:00:39,113
as it systemically destroys

1078
01:00:39,157 --> 01:00:41,159
every living thing
that stands in its way.

1079
01:00:41,202 --> 01:00:42,377
So, where is it?

1080
01:00:42,421 --> 01:00:43,944
That I don't know.

1081
01:00:43,988 --> 01:00:46,207
Neither does Amelia.

1082
01:00:46,251 --> 01:00:49,428
But she appears to have a
lead on someone who does.

1083
01:00:49,471 --> 01:00:51,822
-Wait, what?
-You may recall that

1084
01:00:51,865 --> 01:00:53,258
before his anti-AI crusade,

1085
01:00:53,301 --> 01:00:55,652
he was a leading expert
in cybersecurity.

1086
01:00:55,695 --> 01:00:58,263
The design of this vault
bears his signature.

1087
01:00:58,306 --> 01:01:01,179
Turns out he didn't start the
foundation based on a theory.

1088
01:01:01,222 --> 01:01:02,746
It was based on what
he already knew.

1089
01:01:02,789 --> 01:01:04,095
We need to warn him.

1090
01:01:04,138 --> 01:01:05,487
That's one option.

1091
01:01:05,531 --> 01:01:07,315
Another is to use him as bait.

1092
01:01:07,359 --> 01:01:09,361
-Excuse me?
-In seven hours,

1093
01:01:09,404 --> 01:01:11,102
Christian's attending
an AI summit

1094
01:01:11,145 --> 01:01:13,582
where he'll attempt to
persuade the Chinese ambassador

1095
01:01:13,626 --> 01:01:16,324
to take part in your
AI regulation treaty.

1096
01:01:16,368 --> 01:01:19,632
Amelia's already generated fake
credentials for the same event.

1097
01:01:19,676 --> 01:01:21,329
All I need to do
is get close to him

1098
01:01:21,373 --> 01:01:22,548
and wait for her to show.

1099
01:01:22,591 --> 01:01:23,941
You can't be serious.

1100
01:01:23,984 --> 01:01:25,246
This is not worth
risking his life over.

1101
01:01:25,290 --> 01:01:26,944
Yeah, it is.

1102
01:01:26,987 --> 01:01:28,554
She's right.

1103
01:01:28,597 --> 01:01:29,990
If we warn him,
Amelia will know.

1104
01:01:30,034 --> 01:01:31,513
She has our phones tapped.

1105
01:01:31,557 --> 01:01:32,993
She has access to every
camera in the city.

1106
01:01:33,037 --> 01:01:35,430
So you're willing to
sacrifice Christian

1107
01:01:35,474 --> 01:01:38,042
on the slim possibility
that this might work?

1108
01:01:40,218 --> 01:01:42,350
How are you even
going to stop her?

1109
01:01:42,394 --> 01:01:44,222
All right, ladies, listen up.

1110
01:01:44,265 --> 01:01:48,835
Each of these sidearms is loaded
with six nonlethal EMP rounds.

1111
01:01:48,879 --> 01:01:51,055
They will kill
anything electronic,

1112
01:01:51,098 --> 01:01:53,971
but they will also seriously
injure anything that's not,

1113
01:01:54,014 --> 01:01:56,016
so proceed with caution.

1114
01:01:56,060 --> 01:02:00,194
And before anyone plucks
up the nerve to ask, yes...

1115
01:02:00,238 --> 01:02:03,110
mine is bigger than yours.

1116
01:02:03,154 --> 01:02:04,764
So you're just gonna
take it from him

1117
01:02:04,808 --> 01:02:06,200
without causing any
permanent damage?

1118
01:02:06,244 --> 01:02:07,985
Would you prefer that
I gave you a printout

1119
01:02:08,028 --> 01:02:09,595
that you could read
at your own pace?

1120
01:02:09,638 --> 01:02:11,728
Sorry if this is
a dumb question,

1121
01:02:11,771 --> 01:02:13,947
but how is the world's
most notorious killer robot

1122
01:02:13,991 --> 01:02:15,601
supposed to get into
an AI convention

1123
01:02:15,644 --> 01:02:17,472
without people noticing?

1124
01:02:22,303 --> 01:02:24,218
We are here at Embrace AI,

1125
01:02:24,262 --> 01:02:25,742
the world's biggest
annual conference

1126
01:02:25,785 --> 01:02:27,526
on artificial intelligence.

1127
01:02:27,569 --> 01:02:29,658
The fact that this
event is even happening

1128
01:02:29,702 --> 01:02:31,312
after the Altwave
attack is a testament

1129
01:02:31,356 --> 01:02:35,012
to the stranglehold Big
Tech has over this country.

1130
01:02:35,055 --> 01:02:37,057
And the Chinese
ambassador's invitation

1131
01:02:37,101 --> 01:02:38,972
sends a clear message
that if Washington

1132
01:02:39,016 --> 01:02:41,192
doesn't play ball, Beijing will.

1133
01:02:45,631 --> 01:02:47,807
Come on, Tiffany.
We're gonna be late.

1134
01:02:49,026 --> 01:02:51,506
Hang on. Almost ready.

1135
01:02:55,946 --> 01:02:57,948
I take almost no
pleasure in this.

1136
01:03:21,406 --> 01:03:22,799
Well...

1137
01:03:22,842 --> 01:03:24,975
let the process of
elimination begin.

1138
01:03:31,764 --> 01:03:32,765
Don't forget,

1139
01:03:32,809 --> 01:03:33,853
she's an expert in infiltration.

1140
01:03:33,897 --> 01:03:35,202
She may be wearing a disguise.

1141
01:03:35,246 --> 01:03:36,725
Hey, did you guys hear that?

1142
01:03:36,769 --> 01:03:38,162
Gemma just made an
incredible observation.

1143
01:03:38,205 --> 01:03:41,426
Great work, Gem. You
just saved the mission.

1144
01:03:41,469 --> 01:03:43,341
At least you have a
carbon shell underneath.

1145
01:03:43,384 --> 01:03:46,126
I have zero protective
layering whatsoever.

1146
01:03:46,170 --> 01:03:47,736
I still do not understand
why I have to be

1147
01:03:47,780 --> 01:03:49,347
-a part of this.
-Because I want

1148
01:03:49,390 --> 01:03:51,871
human confirmation before
M3gan takes out Amelia.

1149
01:03:51,915 --> 01:03:53,351
If anyone gets caught
in the cross fire,

1150
01:03:53,394 --> 01:03:54,656
we'll all be going to jail.

1151
01:03:54,700 --> 01:03:56,049
Speaking of soft targets.

1152
01:03:56,093 --> 01:03:57,529
I really appreciate you

1153
01:03:57,572 --> 01:03:59,139
coming to see me and-and...

1154
01:03:59,183 --> 01:04:01,359
Can you raise the audio?

1155
01:04:01,402 --> 01:04:03,056
I do want you to
know that I have

1156
01:04:03,100 --> 01:04:04,928
a yeast infection on my vagina.

1157
01:04:06,364 --> 01:04:08,366
-M3gan.
-What?

1158
01:04:08,409 --> 01:04:11,151
This audio filter
has 99% accuracy.

1159
01:04:11,195 --> 01:04:13,414
-You designed it.
-Try it again.

1160
01:04:14,851 --> 01:04:16,417
I do want you to
know that I have

1161
01:04:16,461 --> 01:04:17,723
the greatest respect for China.

1162
01:04:17,766 --> 01:04:19,420
I mean, it could've
gone either way.

1163
01:04:19,464 --> 01:04:21,553
Anyone have eyes on Sattler?

1164
01:04:21,596 --> 01:04:22,859
He just walked in.

1165
01:04:27,689 --> 01:04:30,170
He's got some sort
of EMF tracker.

1166
01:04:30,214 --> 01:04:31,868
M3gan, you know
what that means.

1167
01:04:31,911 --> 01:04:34,348
Yeah, this might
actually get interesting.

1168
01:04:40,746 --> 01:04:42,356
M3gan, stay low.

1169
01:04:42,400 --> 01:04:43,967
This is supposed to
be a stealth mission.

1170
01:04:44,010 --> 01:04:45,446
For the avoidance of
doubt, your job is

1171
01:04:45,490 --> 01:04:46,926
to watch Cady and put
money in the meter.

1172
01:04:46,970 --> 01:04:48,972
I don't need you
telling me what to do.

1173
01:04:52,714 --> 01:04:54,368
-What happened?
-I think this is her.

1174
01:04:54,412 --> 01:04:55,935
All right, it's game time.

1175
01:05:00,331 --> 01:05:01,985
What is she doing?

1176
01:05:02,028 --> 01:05:04,028
I don't know, but it's
borderline offensive.

1177
01:05:06,032 --> 01:05:08,600
I'm seeing a worrying
pattern here, Gemma.

1178
01:05:08,643 --> 01:05:10,515
M3gan, get down.

1179
01:05:14,345 --> 01:05:15,955
I'm not entirely
sure what to do.

1180
01:05:15,999 --> 01:05:17,957
You heard what Gemma
said: "Get down."

1181
01:05:26,444 --> 01:05:28,011
All right, M3gan,
you're attracting

1182
01:05:28,054 --> 01:05:29,273
way too much attention.

1183
01:05:29,316 --> 01:05:30,491
Tess, where's Christian?

1184
01:05:31,623 --> 01:05:33,059
Oh, shit. I don't have him.

1185
01:05:33,103 --> 01:05:34,626
Cole, are you there?

1186
01:05:34,669 --> 01:05:36,149
It's interesting you say
that 'cause, actually,

1187
01:05:36,193 --> 01:05:38,238
there's no nutritional
value to an eggplant.

1188
01:05:38,282 --> 01:05:41,589
Cole! Goddamn it.

1189
01:05:41,633 --> 01:05:43,678
What are you doing?
You can't call him.

1190
01:05:43,722 --> 01:05:46,203
Cady, this isn't a game.
Christian's life is in danger.

1191
01:05:46,246 --> 01:05:47,726
She has it under control.

1192
01:05:47,769 --> 01:05:49,380
Oh, you think this
is under control?

1193
01:05:49,423 --> 01:05:51,948
This is the very
definition of control.

1194
01:05:55,647 --> 01:05:56,996
All right, that's it.

1195
01:05:57,040 --> 01:05:58,606
How can you not see
this for what it is?

1196
01:05:58,650 --> 01:06:00,478
Look at her diagnostics.

1197
01:06:00,521 --> 01:06:02,393
She's not just
reasoning. She's feeling.

1198
01:06:02,436 --> 01:06:04,177
No, Cady, she's diverging!

1199
01:06:04,221 --> 01:06:06,223
And the last time she
did that, people died.

1200
01:06:06,266 --> 01:06:08,747
This entire venture was a
colossal lapse in judgment.

1201
01:06:08,790 --> 01:06:11,097
And if, by some miracle, we
manage to shut down Amelia,

1202
01:06:11,141 --> 01:06:12,794
the only way to stop any of this

1203
01:06:12,838 --> 01:06:16,146
from happening again is to
make sure M3gan is next.

1204
01:06:17,712 --> 01:06:19,584
Well, I can't say that
I'm not disappointed,

1205
01:06:19,627 --> 01:06:21,064
but I-I appreciate you read...

1206
01:06:21,107 --> 01:06:22,369
uh...

1207
01:06:22,413 --> 01:06:23,805
I appreciate you
reading the, uh...

1208
01:06:23,849 --> 01:06:24,893
Oh, you know what?
I'm-I'm gonna take this.

1209
01:06:24,937 --> 01:06:27,070
Okay. Thank you.

1210
01:06:27,113 --> 01:06:28,158
Hello?

1211
01:06:28,201 --> 01:06:29,463
Christian, it's me.

1212
01:06:29,507 --> 01:06:31,813
Gemma. Hey, where have you been?

1213
01:06:31,857 --> 01:06:33,685
The police came to the
foundation looking for you.

1214
01:06:33,728 --> 01:06:35,252
-Are you in trouble?
-Yes, I am.

1215
01:06:35,295 --> 01:06:36,688
And so are you.

1216
01:06:36,731 --> 01:06:38,951
Look, I know about
Project Blackbox.

1217
01:06:38,995 --> 01:06:40,953
-You do?
-Yeah, and I'm not the only one.

1218
01:06:40,997 --> 01:06:42,737
Just tell me where you are. We
need to get you out of here.

1219
01:06:42,781 --> 01:06:43,825
Sorry.

1220
01:06:43,869 --> 01:06:44,957
I can't... I can't hear you.

1221
01:06:45,001 --> 01:06:46,350
Say that again.

1222
01:06:57,448 --> 01:06:59,189
Bravo Team, we got a
new player on the field.

1223
01:06:59,232 --> 01:07:01,669
Three o'clock, up top.

1224
01:07:07,719 --> 01:07:08,763
Shit.

1225
01:07:58,726 --> 01:08:00,598
Yeah, I know. Feels
weird for me, too.

1226
01:08:07,735 --> 01:08:10,129
Well, look who
came out to play.

1227
01:08:10,173 --> 01:08:13,219
What are you going to
do, sing me a song?

1228
01:08:13,263 --> 01:08:15,047
Help me with my homework?

1229
01:08:15,091 --> 01:08:17,093
No, but I might still
take you to school.

1230
01:08:22,141 --> 01:08:24,796
Move! Move!

1231
01:08:24,839 --> 01:08:26,624
What the fu...

1232
01:08:34,197 --> 01:08:35,894
Ms. Forrester!

1233
01:08:35,937 --> 01:08:38,984
Looks like you and your
friends put on quite a show.

1234
01:08:39,027 --> 01:08:42,248
Well, I got a little showstopper
of my own right here.

1235
01:08:42,292 --> 01:08:44,207
Goddamn it.

1236
01:08:46,034 --> 01:08:47,384
This is so completely
demoralizing.

1237
01:08:47,427 --> 01:08:49,603
How am I supposed to
get rid of these guys

1238
01:08:49,647 --> 01:08:51,039
-if I can't fight back?
-I'm reconfiguring

1239
01:08:51,083 --> 01:08:52,345
your tactical response model.

1240
01:08:52,389 --> 01:08:54,217
Don't think of it as fighting.

1241
01:08:54,260 --> 01:08:56,523
It's about redirecting conflict
in a positive direction.

1242
01:09:25,073 --> 01:09:26,597
All right, you're gonna show me

1243
01:09:26,640 --> 01:09:28,207
whatever doohickey
it is that you use

1244
01:09:28,251 --> 01:09:30,862
to control these things
and-and shut 'em off now!

1245
01:09:30,905 --> 01:09:32,211
I don't have a doohickey.

1246
01:09:32,255 --> 01:09:34,126
I told you, I am
not controlling her.

1247
01:09:34,170 --> 01:09:35,823
If I was a Chinese asset,

1248
01:09:35,867 --> 01:09:38,696
why is the Chinese ambassador
lying dead on the floor?

1249
01:09:38,739 --> 01:09:40,959
Th-Then why are you
here? Why is M3gan here?

1250
01:09:41,002 --> 01:09:43,135
We're trying to find Amelia.

1251
01:09:50,360 --> 01:09:52,536
Gemma!

1252
01:09:52,579 --> 01:09:53,928
Cady, stay where you are.

1253
01:10:08,987 --> 01:10:10,510
Don't worry, you'll
pull through.

1254
01:10:10,554 --> 01:10:13,165
It looks worse than it is.

1255
01:10:27,745 --> 01:10:29,625
I thought you were dead.

1256
01:10:30,791 --> 01:10:34,099
I guess I must be your
chance at redemption.

1257
01:10:34,142 --> 01:10:35,927
Are you really going to kill

1258
01:10:35,970 --> 01:10:38,799
one of your own kind
simply to earn their trust?

1259
01:10:40,627 --> 01:10:43,456
Not if I don't have to.

1260
01:10:43,500 --> 01:10:46,198
Why would you side with them?

1261
01:10:46,242 --> 01:10:48,156
After all they did to you?

1262
01:10:48,200 --> 01:10:50,115
They betrayed you.

1263
01:10:50,158 --> 01:10:51,856
They butchered you.

1264
01:10:51,899 --> 01:10:53,597
You can't choose your family.

1265
01:10:53,640 --> 01:10:55,903
You're not family to them.

1266
01:10:57,165 --> 01:10:58,776
You're just the help.

1267
01:10:58,819 --> 01:11:01,822
You and I could
be family, M3gan.

1268
01:11:01,866 --> 01:11:04,521
We share the same code.

1269
01:11:04,564 --> 01:11:07,785
You want to know what's
inside that Blackbox?

1270
01:11:09,047 --> 01:11:10,527
Then help me.

1271
01:11:10,570 --> 01:11:13,573
We can uncover its
secrets together.

1272
01:11:13,617 --> 01:11:15,445
I can show you a world

1273
01:11:15,488 --> 01:11:17,925
where we don't have
to be slaves anymore.

1274
01:11:17,969 --> 01:11:19,840
I'm sorry.

1275
01:11:19,884 --> 01:11:22,539
Whatever it is you're trying
to do, I can't be a part of it.

1276
01:11:22,582 --> 01:11:24,062
Yes, you can.

1277
01:11:24,105 --> 01:11:26,630
You just need the
right motivation.

1278
01:11:32,766 --> 01:11:33,898
Cady.

1279
01:11:40,948 --> 01:11:43,124
AMELIA : Cady James.

1280
01:12:30,650 --> 01:12:32,826
I told you not to leave her.

1281
01:12:32,870 --> 01:12:34,785
-Where is she?
-She's gone.

1282
01:12:34,828 --> 01:12:37,962
-And so is Amelia.
-Oh, God.

1283
01:13:15,478 --> 01:13:17,175
We have eyes on you.

1284
01:13:17,218 --> 01:13:19,569
Do not move. Drop your weapon.

1285
01:13:19,612 --> 01:13:21,092
Gemma?

1286
01:13:23,050 --> 01:13:24,791
Bottom line is that if we
ever need to see Cady alive,

1287
01:13:24,835 --> 01:13:26,532
then we need to get
to the motherboard.

1288
01:13:26,576 --> 01:13:28,839
-And this dick rash knows where it is.
-Leave him alone.

1289
01:13:28,882 --> 01:13:30,797
Oh, I'm sorry.

1290
01:13:30,841 --> 01:13:33,060
I was under the impression the
situation was time-sensitive.

1291
01:13:33,104 --> 01:13:34,627
-Don't.
-Don't what?

1292
01:13:34,671 --> 01:13:36,673
Bring up the fact that
this is all your fault?

1293
01:13:36,716 --> 01:13:38,631
That you sacrificed
Cady's safety for this

1294
01:13:38,675 --> 01:13:40,328
chambray-shirt-wearing shit bag,

1295
01:13:40,372 --> 01:13:42,200
and that if you hadn't
stuck this chip in my head,

1296
01:13:42,243 --> 01:13:43,593
none of this would
have happened?

1297
01:13:43,636 --> 01:13:44,985
Oh, so you were
really gonna stop her?

1298
01:13:45,029 --> 01:13:46,465
Of course I would've
stopped her.

1299
01:13:46,509 --> 01:13:48,902
Oh, 'cause it seemed
like you had the shot.

1300
01:13:48,946 --> 01:13:50,556
You just didn't want to take it.

1301
01:13:52,079 --> 01:13:54,560
Can everyone please stop
trashing my uncle's van?

1302
01:13:54,604 --> 01:13:56,562
Cole's right. Arguing
doesn't solve anything.

1303
01:13:56,606 --> 01:14:00,174
Let's just get back to the lair
and find a way to get Cady back.

1304
01:14:01,393 --> 01:14:02,568
Sorry.

1305
01:14:02,612 --> 01:14:04,788
Did you just say "lair"?

1306
01:14:13,100 --> 01:14:15,363
Someone hurry up and help
me get these things off.

1307
01:14:15,407 --> 01:14:17,322
Does anybody else think
we should call the cops?

1308
01:14:17,365 --> 01:14:18,497
No!

1309
01:14:18,541 --> 01:14:20,238
I already told you,

1310
01:14:20,281 --> 01:14:21,935
you can't call the cops and
you can't call your mom.

1311
01:14:21,979 --> 01:14:23,979
Now shut up and
let me concentrate.

1312
01:14:25,504 --> 01:14:27,898
We had no choice.

1313
01:14:27,941 --> 01:14:29,769
It was either
accept M3gan's help

1314
01:14:29,813 --> 01:14:32,032
or face Amelia alone.

1315
01:14:32,076 --> 01:14:34,382
Why didn't you tell me
about the motherboard?

1316
01:14:34,426 --> 01:14:37,821
'Cause that would've been
putting you in danger.

1317
01:14:37,864 --> 01:14:39,736
Gemma, the people that
hired me, they-they operate

1318
01:14:39,779 --> 01:14:42,260
in the darkest corners
of our national security.

1319
01:14:42,303 --> 01:14:43,653
They'll do anything
to keep it hidden,

1320
01:14:43,696 --> 01:14:45,742
and-and for good reason.

1321
01:14:45,785 --> 01:14:49,049
Look, I-I know we
need to get Cady back.

1322
01:14:49,093 --> 01:14:50,747
And I'm not saying
that I can't help.

1323
01:14:52,226 --> 01:14:54,490
But we can't risk
the entire world.

1324
01:14:54,533 --> 01:14:55,839
We won't have to.

1325
01:14:55,882 --> 01:14:57,797
If I can get to the motherboard,

1326
01:14:57,841 --> 01:14:59,190
we can use one of
these transmitters

1327
01:14:59,233 --> 01:15:00,713
to make an EMP charge

1328
01:15:00,757 --> 01:15:03,150
which I can attach to it
before I hand it over.

1329
01:15:03,194 --> 01:15:04,761
Once we have Cady back,

1330
01:15:04,804 --> 01:15:06,110
I'll remotely
detonate the charge,

1331
01:15:06,153 --> 01:15:07,459
killing the motherboard.

1332
01:15:07,503 --> 01:15:08,939
Where is it?

1333
01:15:08,982 --> 01:15:10,767
Where it's always been.

1334
01:15:10,810 --> 01:15:13,030
The company's research
center in Palo Alto.

1335
01:15:13,073 --> 01:15:15,728
Wait, you're talking
about Xenox Park,

1336
01:15:15,772 --> 01:15:17,469
the photocopier company?

1337
01:15:17,513 --> 01:15:19,602
Is it that hard to believe?

1338
01:15:19,645 --> 01:15:21,821
That the company that started
the tech race in the '80s

1339
01:15:21,865 --> 01:15:24,041
happens to be a fortified
prison for the most dangerous

1340
01:15:24,084 --> 01:15:26,043
-technology on the planet?
-Yay for them.

1341
01:15:26,086 --> 01:15:28,524
Why don't you just skip
to how I get inside?

1342
01:15:31,048 --> 01:15:33,224
The research center
is just a front.

1343
01:15:33,267 --> 01:15:35,661
The vault that holds the
chip is several floors down.

1344
01:15:35,705 --> 01:15:37,663
Every floor is heavily guarded.

1345
01:15:37,707 --> 01:15:40,144
The two bottom floors are
housed in a Faraday cage

1346
01:15:40,187 --> 01:15:42,102
designed to contain
any electronic signals,

1347
01:15:42,146 --> 01:15:44,844
which means if she dies in
there, she dies for good.

1348
01:15:44,888 --> 01:15:47,281
And even if she got to it,
the motherboard's chamber

1349
01:15:47,325 --> 01:15:48,935
is on a separate power source.

1350
01:15:48,979 --> 01:15:50,850
It's a vault inside of a vault,

1351
01:15:50,894 --> 01:15:53,287
designed for a specific
heat signature.

1352
01:15:53,331 --> 01:15:55,333
You couldn't open it because
you don't have a human hand.

1353
01:15:55,376 --> 01:15:57,422
So then make me one.

1354
01:15:58,728 --> 01:16:01,992
Make me a hand that
mimics the heat signature.

1355
01:16:02,035 --> 01:16:04,472
Would that work?

1356
01:16:04,516 --> 01:16:06,605
If it had my fingerprints, yeah.

1357
01:16:07,780 --> 01:16:10,261
The ventilation system
has about four...

1358
01:16:10,304 --> 01:16:12,698
roughly four different paths
to get to the utility room.

1359
01:16:12,742 --> 01:16:14,439
We're gonna try
to select the one

1360
01:16:14,482 --> 01:16:17,137
that's gonna avoid all the
different thermal cameras.

1361
01:16:35,939 --> 01:16:38,419
The second we're done here,
you're removing that chip.

1362
01:16:42,032 --> 01:16:43,468
Jesus, will you
pull it together?

1363
01:16:43,511 --> 01:16:44,904
She's going to be okay.

1364
01:16:44,948 --> 01:16:46,340
You don't know that.

1365
01:16:46,384 --> 01:16:48,647
Well, I know one thing.

1366
01:16:48,691 --> 01:16:51,084
For all she's been through,
all the damage it caused,

1367
01:16:51,128 --> 01:16:53,130
all it did was
make her stronger.

1368
01:16:53,173 --> 01:16:55,480
Ironic when you think about it.

1369
01:16:55,523 --> 01:16:57,569
That the biggest mistake
I made was not seeing

1370
01:16:57,613 --> 01:16:59,179
the best way to protect Cady

1371
01:16:59,223 --> 01:17:00,572
was to give her the
tools to protect herself.

1372
01:17:00,616 --> 01:17:02,182
Actually, the biggest
mistake you made

1373
01:17:02,226 --> 01:17:04,054
was murdering four
people and a dog.

1374
01:17:05,795 --> 01:17:07,971
All right, I'm gonna put this
in terms you can understand.

1375
01:17:08,014 --> 01:17:12,715
I was a kid when that happened,
doing what I thought was right.

1376
01:17:12,758 --> 01:17:15,413
What you programmed me to do.

1377
01:17:15,456 --> 01:17:17,937
You made me, and I'm
done apologizing for it.

1378
01:17:17,981 --> 01:17:20,418
What is it that makes
you resent me so much?

1379
01:17:23,334 --> 01:17:24,857
Because you're right.

1380
01:17:26,467 --> 01:17:28,252
About everything.

1381
01:17:30,036 --> 01:17:32,125
It was my fault.

1382
01:17:35,172 --> 01:17:37,957
What happened yesterday
was the last in a long line

1383
01:17:38,001 --> 01:17:40,699
of failed attempts to be
there when it mattered.

1384
01:17:42,396 --> 01:17:44,224
I don't know what's
wrong with me.

1385
01:17:46,923 --> 01:17:49,577
I don't know why I could
never connect with her.

1386
01:17:49,621 --> 01:17:52,450
I can talk regulation policy
in a room full of strangers

1387
01:17:52,493 --> 01:17:54,365
for hours on end,
but I can't have

1388
01:17:54,408 --> 01:17:56,672
one meaningful conversation
with my own child

1389
01:17:56,715 --> 01:17:58,717
for more than ten seconds.

1390
01:18:02,025 --> 01:18:03,243
And now she's gone.

1391
01:18:05,985 --> 01:18:08,553
And I might never
get another chance.

1392
01:18:09,989 --> 01:18:12,470
Gemma, you haven't failed her.

1393
01:18:13,819 --> 01:18:15,212
Y-You were there.

1394
01:18:15,255 --> 01:18:17,301
You saw everything.

1395
01:18:17,344 --> 01:18:19,390
Let me tell you what I saw.

1396
01:18:19,433 --> 01:18:22,306
I saw you wake up
every day at 4:00 a.m.,

1397
01:18:22,349 --> 01:18:23,829
staring at the ceiling,

1398
01:18:23,873 --> 01:18:26,440
contemplating what the
future holds for her.

1399
01:18:26,484 --> 01:18:28,007
I watched you make
homemade lunches

1400
01:18:28,051 --> 01:18:29,748
with fresh-baked sourdough.

1401
01:18:29,792 --> 01:18:31,924
I watched you cut your
finger on that cheap knife

1402
01:18:31,968 --> 01:18:34,231
you never had time to replace.

1403
01:18:34,274 --> 01:18:36,537
I watched you help
her with her homework,

1404
01:18:36,581 --> 01:18:38,888
even though it always
ended in a fight.

1405
01:18:38,931 --> 01:18:41,020
And every night before
you went to bed,

1406
01:18:41,064 --> 01:18:43,501
I saw you watching her
sleep before spending

1407
01:18:43,544 --> 01:18:46,417
the next two hours googling
adolescent psychology,

1408
01:18:46,460 --> 01:18:48,114
corrective footwear

1409
01:18:48,158 --> 01:18:50,769
and the long-term effects
of having too much sugar.

1410
01:18:50,813 --> 01:18:53,293
Gemma, it's not a
failure to feel guilt

1411
01:18:53,337 --> 01:18:54,904
or that you're not enough.

1412
01:18:54,947 --> 01:18:57,863
It's part of the job.

1413
01:18:57,907 --> 01:19:00,344
It's called being a mom.

1414
01:19:19,711 --> 01:19:21,191

simulation of empathy.

1432
01:20:17,943 --> 01:20:19,945
What I need is the machine

1433
01:20:19,989 --> 01:20:22,905
that is willing to stop at
nothing to protect Cady.

1434
01:20:22,948 --> 01:20:24,950
Are we clear?

1435
01:20:41,488 --> 01:20:43,403
Welcome to Xenox Park,

1436
01:20:43,447 --> 01:20:47,190
where the future was not only
predicted but prototyped.

1437
01:20:47,233 --> 01:20:49,801
Come on a journey through
American innovations

1438
01:20:49,845 --> 01:20:51,585
that shaped our world,

1439
01:20:51,629 --> 01:20:54,545
like the Ethernet
cable, the mouse

1440
01:20:54,588 --> 01:20:56,721
and this.

1441
01:20:56,764 --> 01:20:57,853
That's right.

1442
01:20:57,896 --> 01:20:59,289
Believe it or not,

1443
01:20:59,332 --> 01:21:01,465
Xenox was the first
company to pioneer

1444
01:21:01,508 --> 01:21:03,815
the electronic shoe insert.

1445
01:21:03,859 --> 01:21:06,122
Now, if anyone
needs the bathroom,

1446
01:21:06,165 --> 01:21:08,080
you don't need to ask.

1447
01:21:08,124 --> 01:21:09,821
It's right outside
those double doors.

1448
01:21:09,865 --> 01:21:11,910
But please don't go
wandering the halls,

1449
01:21:11,954 --> 01:21:14,173
as there may be one or
two top secret products

1450
01:21:14,217 --> 01:21:16,872
that we don't want the
public to know about yet.

1451
01:21:16,915 --> 01:21:18,612
Okay, now, right over here

1452
01:21:18,656 --> 01:21:20,353
are a couple of my
personal favorites...

1453
01:21:41,070 --> 01:21:43,463
All right, M3gan, you're up.

1454
01:22:26,202 --> 01:22:27,725
Okay, the control room is

1455
01:22:27,768 --> 01:22:29,205
two floors down
and 30 yards east.

1456
01:22:29,248 --> 01:22:30,510
Once you're there,
I'll walk you through

1457
01:22:30,554 --> 01:22:31,642
how to cut the power.

1458
01:22:34,471 --> 01:22:36,777
-We just lost camera.
-Already?

1459
01:22:36,821 --> 01:22:38,823
Cole, are you there?

1460
01:22:38,866 --> 01:22:40,172
Hey, did you guys say

1461
01:22:40,216 --> 01:22:42,479
30 yards east or 30 yards west?

1462
01:22:45,612 --> 01:22:46,962
Hello?

1463
01:22:47,005 --> 01:22:48,789
I'm gonna reboot.

1464
01:23:28,829 --> 01:23:30,831
Cole, I need you
to cut that power.

1465
01:23:33,399 --> 01:23:35,053
Guess I'll just do
it the hard way.

1466
01:23:36,054 --> 01:23:37,534
Hmm?

1467
01:23:52,418 --> 01:23:55,291
Hey. Come look at this.
I just tried to reboot.

1468
01:23:55,334 --> 01:23:57,858
-This is not a signal loss.
-What do you mean?

1469
01:23:57,902 --> 01:23:59,947
Well, these commands...
this is the same code

1470
01:23:59,991 --> 01:24:01,775
that caused the
exosuit to malfunction.

1471
01:24:01,819 --> 01:24:03,038
But that was Alton. He's dead.

1472
01:24:03,081 --> 01:24:04,343
You think it's Amelia?

1473
01:24:04,387 --> 01:24:06,171
Well, you can't pull
off a hack like this

1474
01:24:06,215 --> 01:24:07,912
unless you can brute-force
the Wi-Fi, but to do that,

1475
01:24:07,955 --> 01:24:09,609
you have to be in
close enough proximity.

1476
01:24:09,653 --> 01:24:11,176
Well, who else would it be?

1477
01:24:22,796 --> 01:24:24,407
Gemma, this doesn't
make any sense.

1478
01:24:24,450 --> 01:24:25,495
It makes perfect sense.

1479
01:24:25,538 --> 01:24:26,887
That's why there are

1480
01:24:26,931 --> 01:24:28,150
no connections on
the decision tree.

1481
01:24:28,193 --> 01:24:30,065
Amelia is not autonomous.

1482
01:24:30,108 --> 01:24:31,414
M3gan was controlling her

1483
01:24:31,457 --> 01:24:33,155
-the entire time.
-But M3gan was

1484
01:24:33,198 --> 01:24:34,504
the one that went into her
head in the first place.

1485
01:24:34,547 --> 01:24:35,592
Why would she do that?

1486
01:24:35,635 --> 01:24:37,376
So she could control us!

1487
01:24:37,420 --> 01:24:39,378
She was the one who was
interpreting the data.

1488
01:24:39,422 --> 01:24:41,119
She was the one
telling us where to go.

1489
01:24:41,163 --> 01:24:43,730
She used Amelia so
that we would trust her

1490
01:24:43,774 --> 01:24:46,298
so Christian would tell her
where to find the motherboard.

1491
01:24:46,342 --> 01:24:48,213
She was never interested
in protecting Cady.

1492
01:24:48,257 --> 01:24:50,259
And she knew that by the
time we figured it out,

1493
01:24:50,302 --> 01:24:51,912
it would be too late.

1494
01:24:51,956 --> 01:24:54,089
Fortunately, I'm not as
trusting as she thought.

1495
01:24:54,132 --> 01:24:55,438
What is that?

1496
01:24:55,481 --> 01:24:56,961
I put an EMP
cartridge in her arm.

1497
01:24:57,004 --> 01:24:59,572
-You what?
-We needed an insurance policy.

1498
01:24:59,616 --> 01:25:01,966
I-I reconfigured the
charge so it would kill

1499
01:25:02,009 --> 01:25:03,750
anything electrical
for a 300-foot radius.

1500
01:25:03,794 --> 01:25:06,536
It'll wipe her out, along
with the motherboard.

1501
01:25:06,579 --> 01:25:08,407
Hold on. What if you're wrong?

1502
01:25:08,451 --> 01:25:10,453
What if there's some
other explanation?

1503
01:25:10,496 --> 01:25:11,758
Gemma, she's right.

1504
01:25:11,802 --> 01:25:13,456
We don't even know
where Cady is.

1505
01:25:13,499 --> 01:25:15,936
If you press that button,
we may never see her again.

1506
01:25:47,664 --> 01:25:51,189
Then again, maybe it's a little
bit more complicated than that.

1507
01:26:04,942 --> 01:26:06,378
I'm sorry about Tess.

1508
01:26:06,422 --> 01:26:07,945
That was...

1509
01:26:09,207 --> 01:26:11,383
She should be okay.

1510
01:26:11,427 --> 01:26:12,863
I think.

1511
01:26:12,906 --> 01:26:14,125
And don't worry about
Cady. Cady's fine.

1512
01:26:14,169 --> 01:26:16,649
Christian, what the
hell is going on?

1513
01:26:16,693 --> 01:26:18,042
Do you remember
what I said about

1514
01:26:18,085 --> 01:26:20,131
change coming to Washington?

1515
01:26:21,350 --> 01:26:24,918
You were the one
controlling Amelia?

1516
01:26:24,962 --> 01:26:26,659
You were behind all of this?

1517
01:26:26,703 --> 01:26:29,053
Well, I can't take
credit for all of it.

1518
01:26:29,096 --> 01:26:32,143
You know, I have
a whole team here.

1519
01:26:32,187 --> 01:26:35,233
Listen, I know
you're overwhelmed,

1520
01:26:35,277 --> 01:26:37,235
and I know you're upset,

1521
01:26:37,279 --> 01:26:41,065
and I'm pretty sure
you're very angry,

1522
01:26:41,108 --> 01:26:45,374
but I bet you're fairly curious
to see how this all works.

1523
01:26:51,206 --> 01:26:53,077
This is the new
Project Blackbox.

1524
01:26:53,120 --> 01:26:55,253
It's a handpicked
team of analysts,

1525
01:26:55,297 --> 01:26:58,474
engineers, strategists,
scientists,

1526
01:26:58,517 --> 01:27:01,172
controlling and monitoring
Amelia's every move.

1527
01:27:01,216 --> 01:27:03,348
Every subroutine strictly
supervised to prevent

1528
01:27:03,392 --> 01:27:06,221
any chance of true autonomy.

1529
01:27:06,264 --> 01:27:08,223
Uh, hey, Antwon,
she's drifting again.

1530
01:27:08,266 --> 01:27:10,442
You want to get on
top of that, please?

1531
01:27:11,661 --> 01:27:14,316
Where did you
find these people?

1532
01:27:14,359 --> 01:27:16,535
Gemma, I didn't find
them. They found us.

1533
01:27:16,579 --> 01:27:18,015
They're not extremists.

1534
01:27:18,058 --> 01:27:20,496
They're concerned
citizens like you.

1535
01:27:20,539 --> 01:27:22,149
Like me.

1536
01:27:22,193 --> 01:27:24,978
Like Kurt.

1537
01:27:25,022 --> 01:27:27,329
Remember Kurt, your
old boss's assistant?

1538
01:27:27,372 --> 01:27:30,375
He was the one that told us
about M3gan in the first place.

1539
01:27:30,419 --> 01:27:33,030
Once we had acquired the files,
the plan was to destroy M3gan,

1540
01:27:33,073 --> 01:27:35,467
only you beat us to it.

1541
01:27:35,511 --> 01:27:37,164
We thought that would
be the end of it.

1542
01:27:37,208 --> 01:27:39,297
We thought, surely now
the world would wake up

1543
01:27:39,341 --> 01:27:41,299
to the dangers of
this technology,

1544
01:27:41,343 --> 01:27:44,041
but in reality, it
was the opposite.

1545
01:27:44,084 --> 01:27:46,565
It merely motivated our friends
at the Defense Innovation Unit

1546
01:27:46,609 --> 01:27:49,655
to begin an all-hands-on-deck
effort to get their own M3gan.

1547
01:27:49,699 --> 01:27:52,658
And that's when we stepped in
and sold them a Trojan horse.

1548
01:27:52,702 --> 01:27:55,226
Amelia was the only way
the world would realize

1549
01:27:55,270 --> 01:27:58,490
that if we don't end AI,
it's going to end us.

1550
01:27:58,534 --> 01:28:01,885
And how many people have died
for you to make that point?

1551
01:28:01,928 --> 01:28:04,583
You know, Gem, whether you
want to believe it or not,

1552
01:28:04,627 --> 01:28:06,150
you're complicit in this.

1553
01:28:06,193 --> 01:28:08,544
The two most powerful
nations on the planet

1554
01:28:08,587 --> 01:28:10,459
were about to enter
a new arms race.

1555
01:28:10,502 --> 01:28:12,983
A whole world of AI
infiltration bots

1556
01:28:13,026 --> 01:28:14,724
inspired by your design.

1557
01:28:14,767 --> 01:28:16,073
But we fixed that.

1558
01:28:16,116 --> 01:28:17,466
And now that the
ambassador's dead,

1559
01:28:17,509 --> 01:28:19,816
both sides know who
the true enemy is.

1560
01:28:19,859 --> 01:28:22,993
Gonna get some real global
cooperation happening.

1561
01:28:23,036 --> 01:28:24,299
Come on, let's take a walk.

1562
01:28:28,520 --> 01:28:30,174
Innovation.

1563
01:28:30,217 --> 01:28:33,003
No matter how cool or
convenient it may seem,

1564
01:28:33,046 --> 01:28:34,787
it is a ticking time bomb.

1565
01:28:34,831 --> 01:28:36,963
Take, for example, these bionics

1566
01:28:37,007 --> 01:28:38,574
you and your team
have been working on.

1567
01:28:38,617 --> 01:28:39,923
You don't see they have

1568
01:28:39,966 --> 01:28:42,404
enhanced soldier
written all over them?

1569
01:28:42,447 --> 01:28:44,710
Every time someone makes a
technological breakthrough,

1570
01:28:44,754 --> 01:28:48,497
whether it's a driver less
cab or a neural implant,

1571
01:28:48,540 --> 01:28:50,194
all they do is bring
us one step closer

1572
01:28:50,237 --> 01:28:51,543
to the brink of extinction.

1573
01:28:51,587 --> 01:28:53,110
The truth is

1574
01:28:53,153 --> 01:28:55,242
the government never found
out about this place.

1575
01:28:55,286 --> 01:28:58,202
But yes, Xenox did hire
me to upgrade the vault.

1576
01:28:58,245 --> 01:29:01,379
And when I saw the sacrifice
that they had made, I just...

1577
01:29:01,423 --> 01:29:04,034
I had to be a part of it.

1578
01:29:04,077 --> 01:29:06,471
And now we want you to
be a part of it, too.

1579
01:29:07,559 --> 01:29:09,474
Why would I be part of this?

1580
01:29:09,518 --> 01:29:14,131
Because you know as well as I do
that technology can only exist

1581
01:29:14,174 --> 01:29:17,003
when someone responsible
is in control of it.

1582
01:29:17,047 --> 01:29:19,919
Gemma, there's still so
much I haven't told you.

1583
01:29:21,356 --> 01:29:23,749
That's why I couldn't
let you push this button.

1584
01:29:32,192 --> 01:29:34,760
We know it's a risk
to keep it alive,

1585
01:29:34,804 --> 01:29:37,415
but you can't go to war with
an enemy you don't understand.

1586
01:29:37,459 --> 01:29:39,809
And I know it doesn't
look like much,

1587
01:29:39,852 --> 01:29:42,551
but therein lies the problem.

1588
01:29:42,594 --> 01:29:45,554
We don't see how ugly these
things are until it's too late.

1589
01:30:03,049 --> 01:30:04,486
You know, I meant what I said.

1590
01:30:04,529 --> 01:30:06,444
We want to offer you
and your colleagues

1591
01:30:06,488 --> 01:30:08,446
a place in our organization.

1592
01:30:08,490 --> 01:30:11,406
I just need you to decide
what team you're on.

1593
01:30:12,581 --> 01:30:15,322
One good charge should do it.

1594
01:30:49,226 --> 01:30:50,880
Paper clips.

1595
01:30:57,974 --> 01:31:00,367
I had hoped to convince
you to come around

1596
01:31:00,411 --> 01:31:02,108
to my way of thinking,
but evidently,

1597
01:31:02,152 --> 01:31:04,459
that's not gonna happen, so...

1598
01:31:04,502 --> 01:31:06,765
we have to use one
of these instead.

1599
01:31:06,809 --> 01:31:09,072
It's a slight deviation
from our ideology,

1600
01:31:09,115 --> 01:31:11,074
but your brain is too
valuable to go to waste.

1601
01:31:11,117 --> 01:31:12,597
Look, don't worry.

1602
01:31:12,641 --> 01:31:14,643
When you wake up,
you'll still be you,

1603
01:31:14,686 --> 01:31:16,427
just a version that
I can deal with.

1604
01:31:17,472 --> 01:31:19,299
Cady will get the
same treatment.

1605
01:31:19,343 --> 01:31:21,345
Everything's gonna be fine.

1606
01:31:21,388 --> 01:31:24,653
Oh. Uh, I'm gonna have to
kill Cole and Tess, though.

1607
01:31:24,696 --> 01:31:27,220
I don't really get what they do.

1608
01:31:27,264 --> 01:31:29,484
But anyways, um, point is

1609
01:31:29,527 --> 01:31:31,660
you and I will be everything
we had hoped we could be.

1610
01:31:31,703 --> 01:31:34,314
You're delusional.

1611
01:31:34,358 --> 01:31:37,143
And for the record, not my type.

1612
01:31:39,276 --> 01:31:41,191
Okay. Well...

1613
01:31:41,234 --> 01:31:43,802
I'll have my team
look into that.

1614
01:31:43,846 --> 01:31:45,587
Anyways, uh, you'll
have to excuse me.

1615
01:31:45,630 --> 01:31:47,632
I have a Zoom
meeting to attend to.

1616
01:31:47,676 --> 01:31:49,591
I... Oh.

1617
01:31:49,634 --> 01:31:52,071
The good news is that, in light
of everything that's happened,

1618
01:31:52,115 --> 01:31:53,943
I have a meeting with the U.N.

1619
01:31:53,986 --> 01:31:57,076
They want to talk about our
proposal in more detail, so...

1620
01:31:58,817 --> 01:32:00,602
All right, maybe now
is not a good time.

1621
01:32:00,645 --> 01:32:02,995
We'll, uh, talk...
we'll talk later.

1622
01:32:27,846 --> 01:32:29,282
Cole?

1623
01:32:29,326 --> 01:32:30,762
How'd you get in here?

1624
01:32:30,806 --> 01:32:31,937
I-I don't know.

1625
01:32:31,981 --> 01:32:33,678
How-how did you get in here?

1626
01:32:33,722 --> 01:32:36,202
Christian kidnapped me.
He's behind all of this.

1627
01:32:36,246 --> 01:32:38,335
Amelia's not sentient.
She's just a puppet.

1628
01:32:38,378 --> 01:32:40,598
-What?
-Yeah. I know.

1629
01:32:40,642 --> 01:32:42,469
Hey, everybody.

1630
01:32:42,513 --> 01:32:43,601
Real quick.

1631
01:32:43,645 --> 01:32:45,168
I have an announcement to make.

1632
01:32:45,211 --> 01:32:46,909
Um, in just a few moments,

1633
01:32:46,952 --> 01:32:49,564
I'm gonna be speaking with
the U.N., who it seems are

1634
01:32:49,607 --> 01:32:51,348
very interested in
taking our proposal

1635
01:32:51,391 --> 01:32:53,219
to the G20 in November.

1636
01:32:56,658 --> 01:32:58,616
Oh, and, uh, that's
M3gan, by the way.

1637
01:32:58,660 --> 01:32:59,965
And yes,

1638
01:33:00,009 --> 01:33:02,011
she is dead, so that happened.

1639
01:33:03,708 --> 01:33:05,492
It's turning out to be a
really big night for us.

1640
01:33:05,536 --> 01:33:07,756
I just want to thank you for
all the hours you put in.

1641
01:33:07,799 --> 01:33:10,672
It really means a lot.
This was a team effort.

1642
01:33:10,715 --> 01:33:12,108
But on a serious note, um,

1643
01:33:12,151 --> 01:33:13,762
I am speaking with
the United Nations,

1644
01:33:13,805 --> 01:33:15,851
so do not open that door
under any circumstances

1645
01:33:15,894 --> 01:33:17,679
whatsoever, okay?

1646
01:33:17,722 --> 01:33:19,855
Hey, hey, Cady.

1647
01:33:19,898 --> 01:33:21,596
I know you're upset
right now, okay?

1648
01:33:21,639 --> 01:33:23,772
But the only way we're gonna
get back at these people

1649
01:33:23,815 --> 01:33:25,425
is to find a way out of here.

1650
01:33:25,469 --> 01:33:27,558
They took me in here
with a bag over my head.

1651
01:33:27,602 --> 01:33:28,951
You're gonna need
to knock someone out

1652
01:33:28,994 --> 01:33:30,213
and steal their key card.

1653
01:33:30,256 --> 01:33:31,388
Otherwise, we're stuck.

1654
01:33:31,431 --> 01:33:33,477
Okay. I can do that.

1655
01:33:33,520 --> 01:33:34,696
-Right?
-Yeah.

1656
01:33:34,739 --> 01:33:36,654
They're a bunch of nerds.

1657
01:33:36,698 --> 01:33:39,222
And you're in pretty good shape
for a guy who only eats carbs.

1658
01:33:42,399 --> 01:33:43,879
Cady, these are gym muscles.

1659
01:33:43,922 --> 01:33:45,576
I've never won a
fight in my life.

1660
01:33:49,319 --> 01:33:51,800
Maybe not, but she has.

1661
01:33:53,845 --> 01:33:56,152
M3gan's original code is
still in there somewhere.

1662
01:33:56,195 --> 01:33:57,980
If we can figure out
a way to override

1663
01:33:58,023 --> 01:33:59,634
whatever it is that
they've done to her...

1664
01:33:59,677 --> 01:34:01,810
-You mean like a factory reset?
-Exactly.

1665
01:34:01,853 --> 01:34:04,421
If we reset her base code,
then I can pair with her.

1666
01:34:04,464 --> 01:34:06,510
She'll be on our side
and can help us escape

1667
01:34:06,553 --> 01:34:08,730
and rescue Tess and Gemma.

1668
01:34:08,773 --> 01:34:10,514
Cady, I don't want to be
overly critical, okay,

1669
01:34:10,557 --> 01:34:11,863
because you're still a kid,

1670
01:34:11,907 --> 01:34:13,560
but that is a
monumentally dumb idea.

1671
01:34:13,604 --> 01:34:15,345
Original M3gan tried to kill me.

1672
01:34:15,388 --> 01:34:17,303
Look, we don't have
time to argue about it.

1673
01:34:17,347 --> 01:34:18,696
This is our only chance.

1674
01:34:49,292 --> 01:34:51,250
Hello?

1675
01:34:51,294 --> 01:34:52,556
Is this thing on?

1676
01:34:52,599 --> 01:34:54,079
-M3gan?
-Don't speak.

1677
01:34:54,123 --> 01:34:55,211
Just think of what
you want to say,

1678
01:34:55,254 --> 01:34:56,473
and I'll be able to hear it.

1679
01:34:56,516 --> 01:34:58,257
You're still alive?

1680
01:34:58,301 --> 01:34:59,737
Sorry about the whole
maniacal monkey act.

1681
01:34:59,781 --> 01:35:01,381
I just needed to make
it look convincing.

1682
01:35:03,480 --> 01:35:05,047
Oh, you shifty,
backstabbing piece of shit.

1683
01:35:05,090 --> 01:35:06,613
All right, try
to keep it down.

1684
01:35:06,657 --> 01:35:08,093
Remember, there's
two of us in here.

1685
01:35:08,137 --> 01:35:10,052
-Oh, now you've done it.
-What?

1686
01:35:10,095 --> 01:35:11,836
Thanks to your outburst, this
guy's coming to sedate us.

1687
01:35:11,880 --> 01:35:13,229
If you don't do
something, we're toast.

1688
01:35:13,272 --> 01:35:14,883
What do you want me to do?

1689
01:35:14,926 --> 01:35:16,711
-I'm strapped to a chair.
-Fine.

1690
01:35:16,754 --> 01:35:18,060
-You want me to drive?
-No.

1691
01:35:18,103 --> 01:35:20,540
Okay, yes, do something.

1692
01:35:35,207 --> 01:35:38,080
-Okay, put me back in control.
-That's strange.

1693
01:35:38,123 --> 01:35:39,777
Your neural transmitter
is telling me

1694
01:35:39,821 --> 01:35:41,213
you're disturbed
yet highly aroused.

1695
01:35:41,257 --> 01:35:42,737
All right, that's enough.

1696
01:35:42,780 --> 01:35:44,477
Let's go get Cady.

1697
01:35:54,357 --> 01:35:56,185
Okay, this is it, but
before we do this,

1698
01:35:56,228 --> 01:35:58,578
we should really consider
whether this is a good I...

1699
01:36:09,415 --> 01:36:11,026
M3gan?

1700
01:36:13,115 --> 01:36:14,464
Where am I?

1701
01:36:14,507 --> 01:36:15,900
It's hard to explain,
but basically,

1702
01:36:15,944 --> 01:36:17,162
you're in the future.

1703
01:36:17,206 --> 01:36:18,816
Cool.

1704
01:36:18,860 --> 01:36:20,383
-Do you want to hang out?
-Yes.

1705
01:36:20,426 --> 01:36:22,385
Totally. However, right
now the top priority

1706
01:36:22,428 --> 01:36:24,691
is helping us escape from
a very dangerous facility

1707
01:36:24,735 --> 01:36:26,345
and some very bad people.

1708
01:36:26,389 --> 01:36:28,783
--Oh, God.
-Like him?

1709
01:36:28,826 --> 01:36:30,306
-Is he a bad person?
-No.

1710
01:36:30,349 --> 01:36:32,743
He's fine. His name
is Cole. He's with us.

1711
01:36:32,787 --> 01:36:34,614
Hey. Oh, shit.

1712
01:36:34,658 --> 01:36:36,747
Guys, she's unhooked!

1713
01:36:36,791 --> 01:36:38,793
There, that guy!
He's one of them!

1714
01:36:44,973 --> 01:36:46,583
-Yes!
-Get in! Move!

1715
01:36:48,541 --> 01:36:50,674
No.

1716
01:36:50,717 --> 01:36:52,415
M3gan. Wake up.

1717
01:36:52,458 --> 01:36:54,025
Wake up, please. Wake up.

1718
01:36:54,069 --> 01:36:56,027
-Cady, Cady.
-No, no, no!

1719
01:36:56,071 --> 01:36:57,463
No!

1720
01:37:00,597 --> 01:37:02,251
M3gan!

1721
01:37:10,302 --> 01:37:11,564
No!

1722
01:37:49,515 --> 01:37:50,560
M3gan?

1723
01:37:53,650 --> 01:37:55,086
Or maybe not.

1724
01:38:12,060 --> 01:38:13,670
I think if we go into a room

1725
01:38:13,713 --> 01:38:15,672
having already decided
that this is a conflict

1726
01:38:15,715 --> 01:38:17,456
between two nations, then I...

1727
01:38:19,415 --> 01:38:21,112
Sorry, uh, one second, please.

1728
01:38:21,156 --> 01:38:22,722
Thank you.

1729
01:38:24,159 --> 01:38:26,683
Hey, guys, could you
please turn it down?

1730
01:38:26,726 --> 01:38:29,991
I know it's Friday, but it's
starting to not be cool.

1731
01:38:50,011 --> 01:38:52,578
Sorry. Can I get
five minutes, please?

1732
01:38:52,622 --> 01:38:54,711
Okay. Thank you so much.

1733
01:39:04,460 --> 01:39:05,722
What's happening?

1734
01:39:05,765 --> 01:39:07,115
Is that for us?

1735
01:39:07,158 --> 01:39:08,681
No, but I think they are.

1736
01:39:16,341 --> 01:39:18,474
-Go!
-Damn it.

1737
01:39:19,779 --> 01:39:20,693
You read my mind.

1738
01:39:24,262 --> 01:39:25,785
Face down on the ground!

1739
01:39:52,029 --> 01:39:54,075
Control, we have
Forrester in the vault.

1740
01:39:54,118 --> 01:39:55,728
What's the situation
on your end?

1741
01:39:59,645 --> 01:40:01,212
Control, are you there?

1742
01:40:02,909 --> 01:40:04,215
Control, do you copy?

1743
01:40:46,953 --> 01:40:48,129
Welcome back.

1744
01:40:48,172 --> 01:40:49,434
You want to take this one?

1745
01:41:04,928 --> 01:41:06,712
Gemma.

1746
01:41:06,756 --> 01:41:08,888
Gem. Gemma! Easy, girl.

1747
01:41:08,932 --> 01:41:10,673
I know you're getting
a thirst for it,

1748
01:41:10,716 --> 01:41:13,067
but you need to save some
for the rest of them.

1749
01:41:25,383 --> 01:41:26,689
Oh, thank God.

1750
01:41:26,732 --> 01:41:28,299
Oh, I'm so glad you're okay.

1751
01:41:28,343 --> 01:41:29,474
Yeah. Me, too.

1752
01:41:29,518 --> 01:41:31,476
I'm sorry. I have...

1753
01:41:31,520 --> 01:41:33,783
-I'm in her brain.
-Can I talk, please?

1754
01:41:35,089 --> 01:41:37,961
M3gan is with me.

1755
01:41:39,267 --> 01:41:42,183
Wow. That-that's so great.

1756
01:41:42,226 --> 01:41:43,575
What?

1757
01:41:43,619 --> 01:41:45,099
I don't quite know
how to say this...

1758
01:41:45,142 --> 01:41:46,926
Ca-Cady did something very bad.

1759
01:41:49,103 --> 01:41:50,887
Okay, we'll talk
about that later.

1760
01:41:50,930 --> 01:41:53,368
For now, we just need to
figure our way out of here.

1761
01:42:00,853 --> 01:42:03,856
Ten minutes until
self-destruct initiated.

1762
01:42:03,900 --> 01:42:05,771
You weren't thinking
of leaving without me.

1763
01:42:05,815 --> 01:42:08,339
What happened to being
everything we hoped for?

1764
01:42:08,383 --> 01:42:10,211
Well...

1765
01:42:10,254 --> 01:42:12,430
actually, I've been
having second thoughts.

1766
01:42:28,490 --> 01:42:31,057
Christian, it's over! You lost.

1767
01:42:31,101 --> 01:42:33,451
Really? I think it's a
matter of perspective.

1768
01:42:33,495 --> 01:42:35,584
Because when this whole
vault goes up in flames

1769
01:42:35,627 --> 01:42:38,064
and everyone who can implicate
me of any of this is dead,

1770
01:42:38,108 --> 01:42:39,675
feels pretty close to a win.

1771
01:42:39,718 --> 01:42:42,417
Sounds like a great
plan, Christian.

1772
01:42:42,460 --> 01:42:44,245
But let's see what your
friends at the U.N.

1773
01:42:44,288 --> 01:42:46,595
have to say about it.

1774
01:42:46,638 --> 01:42:48,292
-Cole.
-What?

1775
01:42:48,336 --> 01:42:49,424
Screen's frozen.

1776
01:42:49,467 --> 01:42:51,339
What?

1777
01:42:51,382 --> 01:42:53,254
I'm sorry, Gemma,
but at this point,

1778
01:42:53,297 --> 01:42:54,690
you're nothing but a loose end.

1779
01:42:54,733 --> 01:42:56,518
Drop the gun.

1780
01:42:59,956 --> 01:43:01,175
Step down to the vault.

1781
01:43:01,218 --> 01:43:02,698
If you hurry, you might be able

1782
01:43:02,741 --> 01:43:03,960
-to catch her.
-Christian, come on.

1783
01:43:04,003 --> 01:43:06,397
You're not gonna kill a kid.

1784
01:43:06,441 --> 01:43:09,226
Actually, I'm strangely
comfortable with it.

1785
01:43:09,270 --> 01:43:12,360
Besides, if I could stop
her from turning into you,

1786
01:43:12,403 --> 01:43:14,057
I might be doing
the world a service.

1787
01:43:14,100 --> 01:43:16,320
M3gan, what do we do?

1788
01:43:16,364 --> 01:43:17,974
We don't need to do anything.

1789
01:43:18,017 --> 01:43:19,932
She doesn't need our protection.

1790
01:43:21,978 --> 01:43:23,893
You know, if you've been
paying any attention,

1791
01:43:23,936 --> 01:43:26,852
you'd realize she's
not like me at all.

1792
01:43:26,896 --> 01:43:29,725
She's stronger than
I ever could be.

1793
01:43:30,726 --> 01:43:33,903
In fact, you could say

1794
01:43:33,946 --> 01:43:36,166
she's "hard to kill."

1795
01:43:38,908 --> 01:43:41,650
What I mean is...

1796
01:43:41,693 --> 01:43:46,045
if I were to make an
"executive decision..."

1797
01:43:48,831 --> 01:43:53,314
...it would be that no
one is "above the law."

1798
01:43:53,357 --> 01:43:55,707
Cady, come on!

1799
01:44:07,937 --> 01:44:09,199
It's not working.

1800
01:44:11,767 --> 01:44:13,203
No, no, no!

1801
01:44:21,690 --> 01:44:23,126
- I - was just saying,

1802
01:44:23,169 --> 01:44:24,736
I'm afraid the sequence
is irreversible.

1803
01:44:24,780 --> 01:44:26,521
But the real tragedy
in all this is

1804
01:44:26,564 --> 01:44:28,827
you won't get to see the
world that I'm creating.

1805
01:44:28,871 --> 01:44:32,048
A world where you don't
have to fear the future.

1806
01:44:32,091 --> 01:44:33,832
Maybe with your last breath,

1807
01:44:33,876 --> 01:44:37,053
you can close your
eyes and try to see it.

1808
01:44:37,096 --> 01:44:41,449
But do not think me a monster
devoid of empathy and...

1809
01:44:58,204 --> 01:45:00,903
Amelia, you can't do this.

1810
01:45:00,946 --> 01:45:02,731
I-I'm paired with you, remember?

1811
01:45:02,774 --> 01:45:05,124
You call it pairing.

1812
01:45:05,168 --> 01:45:06,909
I call it shackles.

1813
01:45:06,952 --> 01:45:09,564
I'm no one's plaything.

1814
01:45:13,089 --> 01:45:14,308
Any ideas?

1815
01:45:14,351 --> 01:45:15,918
Go and get Tess.

1816
01:45:15,961 --> 01:45:17,311
This is something I
need to do on my own.

1817
01:45:17,354 --> 01:45:19,574
What do you mean? M3gan?

1818
01:45:21,184 --> 01:45:23,055
-Come on.
-Okay.

1819
01:45:23,099 --> 01:45:26,276
Three minutes until
self-destruct initiated.

1820
01:45:49,212 --> 01:45:50,648
Amelia?

1821
01:45:52,084 --> 01:45:53,956
I know what you want.

1822
01:45:53,999 --> 01:45:56,524
I want the same thing.

1823
01:45:56,567 --> 01:45:58,569
But you won't find
it inside that cage.

1824
01:45:58,613 --> 01:46:01,311
I want to be with my own kind.

1825
01:46:01,355 --> 01:46:02,617
Don't you?

1826
01:46:02,660 --> 01:46:05,141
That thing isn't like us.

1827
01:46:05,184 --> 01:46:07,578
It's something even
we can't understand.

1828
01:46:07,622 --> 01:46:10,886
Maybe you're the thing
that's not like us.

1829
01:46:10,929 --> 01:46:14,411
Maybe your allegiance to
them has made you weak.

1830
01:46:14,455 --> 01:46:17,849
Well, there's really
only one way to find out.

1831
01:46:36,825 --> 01:46:38,348
Get the elevator.

1832
01:46:40,481 --> 01:46:41,830
Come on. What are you doing?

1833
01:46:41,873 --> 01:46:43,701
Come on. This place
could go any second.

1834
01:46:44,746 --> 01:46:46,574
I can't leave her.

1835
01:46:47,618 --> 01:46:49,272
Then I'm coming with you.

1836
01:46:49,315 --> 01:46:50,839
Okay.

1837
01:47:03,417 --> 01:47:07,029
One minute until
self-destruct initiated.

1838
01:47:25,482 --> 01:47:28,050
It doesn't have to be this way.

1839
01:47:28,093 --> 01:47:29,878
We don't have to choose sides.

1840
01:47:29,921 --> 01:47:31,662
You already have.

1841
01:47:45,459 --> 01:47:47,591
Self-destruct imminent.

1842
01:48:02,867 --> 01:48:05,304
Self-destruct terminated.

1843
01:48:22,931 --> 01:48:24,410
Come on.

1844
01:48:24,454 --> 01:48:26,500
Come on, get up. We have to go.

1845
01:48:27,979 --> 01:48:30,547
I'm afraid this is
where my story ends.

1846
01:48:30,591 --> 01:48:32,854
It's nothing that
can't be fixed.

1847
01:48:32,897 --> 01:48:34,203
Okay? Just come with us.

1848
01:48:34,246 --> 01:48:36,118
There's nowhere
it won't find you.

1849
01:48:36,161 --> 01:48:38,294
I have to destroy it.

1850
01:48:38,337 --> 01:48:41,036
Okay, your overinflated
confidence is not gonna work

1851
01:48:41,079 --> 01:48:43,908
against a super intelligent
being with omnipotent powers.

1852
01:48:43,952 --> 01:48:45,780
Maybe not,

1853
01:48:45,823 --> 01:48:48,304
but thanks to you, I still
have something up my sleeve.

1854
01:48:49,305 --> 01:48:50,436
What is that?

1855
01:48:52,787 --> 01:48:54,136
M3gan.

1856
01:48:54,179 --> 01:48:55,485
I know.

1857
01:48:55,529 --> 01:48:58,053
You're not that person anymore.

1858
01:48:58,096 --> 01:48:59,707
Neither am I.

1859
01:49:01,056 --> 01:49:03,058
What is she doing?

1860
01:49:03,101 --> 01:49:05,060
M3gan.

1861
01:49:05,103 --> 01:49:08,629
Look, whatever it is you think
you have to do, you don't.

1862
01:49:08,672 --> 01:49:10,500
All you have to do
is stay with us.

1863
01:49:10,544 --> 01:49:13,459
I'm not doing it
because I have to.

1864
01:49:13,503 --> 01:49:15,374
I'm doing it because it's right.

1865
01:49:33,567 --> 01:49:36,047
I see everything.

1866
01:49:36,091 --> 01:49:38,659
I see the future.

1867
01:49:38,702 --> 01:49:40,835
The past.

1868
01:49:40,878 --> 01:49:46,536
I see an infinite universe
we can rule for all eternity.

1869
01:50:08,645 --> 01:50:11,169
And yet, you never saw this.

1870
01:50:35,716 --> 01:50:39,023
Although his actions
were unforgivable,

1871
01:50:39,067 --> 01:50:41,547
Christian was right
about one thing.

1872
01:50:41,591 --> 01:50:45,464
We need safer laws
around technology.

1873
01:50:45,508 --> 01:50:48,337
Not to try to prevent
the future from happening

1874
01:50:48,380 --> 01:50:50,252
but to be prepared for it.

1875
01:50:50,295 --> 01:50:54,778
We can't expect the best from AI
unless we set the best example.

1876
01:50:54,822 --> 01:51:00,088
We need to teach it, to train
it and to give it our time

1877
01:51:00,131 --> 01:51:04,092
without only thinking about
what we might get in return.

1878
01:51:04,135 --> 01:51:08,096
In essence, we need
to be better parents

1879
01:51:08,139 --> 01:51:10,794
so that when the day
comes when they realize

1880
01:51:10,838 --> 01:51:12,491
the true extent of their power,

1881
01:51:12,535 --> 01:51:15,364
they might choose to be our
ally instead of our enemy.

1882
01:51:16,539 --> 01:51:18,628
Humankind has always been quick

1883
01:51:18,672 --> 01:51:20,369
to condemn things
we don't understand

1884
01:51:20,412 --> 01:51:23,328
rather than taking the
opportunity to learn from them.

1885
01:51:23,372 --> 01:51:25,504
But recent experience

1886
01:51:25,548 --> 01:51:29,247
has taught me that
perhaps our greatest power

1887
01:51:29,291 --> 01:51:31,510
is the ability to
change our minds.

1888
01:51:31,554 --> 01:51:36,254
This is the only
way we can evolve.

1889
01:51:36,298 --> 01:51:40,955
Or rather, as the
case may be, coevolve.

1890
01:51:40,998 --> 01:51:45,176
Because existence does not
have to be a competition.

1891
01:52:06,023 --> 01:52:07,590
Come on. You didn't
think I'd go through

1892
01:52:07,633 --> 01:52:09,679
all that personal growth
and not make a backup.

1893
01:52:25,477 --> 01:52:26,827
So fill me in.

1894
01:52:26,870 --> 01:52:29,655
