Thanks for calling me back.

to meet her right now...

20

with her this morning...

21

she had a great time

and only makes 150K a year...

38

and I need to manage
my expectations...

41
00:06:52,073 --> 00:06:56,041
but this is probably the best
first date I've ever had!

42
00:06:56,143 --> 00:06:59,918
Uh, Sophie, so I just got
off the phone with him.

43
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:02,316
And he loved meeting you,

00:07:02,418 --> 00:07:04,387
he had a great time...

45
00:07:04,489 --> 00:07:06,123
But he doesn't feel
like the chemistry

You took a risk. It's brave.

SOPHIE: Why did you set me
up with someone like that?

56
00:07:36,289 --> 00:07:38,721
He checked a lot of our boxes...

57
00:07:39,654 --> 00:07:41,526
and you checked a lot of his.

58
00:07:42,227 --> 00:07:44,425

She's not competitive in
the mainstream market...

But it's up to the client

182

to build a strong
enough relationship...

183
00:13:26,098 --> 00:13:27,437
that leads to marriage.

perfect guy for Char?

swiping on apps.

But the happy ending
to a first date...

191
00:13:44,457 --> 00:13:45,986
is not the second date.

192
00:13:46,088 --> 00:13:48,689
It's changing each
other's diapers

193

232
00:16:04,862 --> 00:16:07,196
Marriage is a business deal.

(ENGINE STARTS, SCREECHING)

542
00:35:04,968 --> 00:35:06,199
I'm just giving you feedback

543
00:35:06,301 --> 00:35:07,616
so you can improve
your performance...

544
00:35:07,699 --> 00:35:09,337
and I can start
getting better matches.

545
00:35:09,439 --> 00:35:11,405
I want to meet someone who
is a combination of all

546
00:35:11,507 --> 00:35:14,206
the different awesome parts
of the last four matches.

547
00:35:14,308 --> 00:35:16,911
Sophie's job and
education level,

548
00:35:17,013 --> 00:35:19,509
Emily's body and lifestyle,

549
00:35:19,611 --> 00:35:22,645
Piper's face and
sense of style...

550
00:35:22,747 --> 00:35:26,956
and Jane's hobbies
and taste in TV shows.

551
00:35:27,058 --> 00:35:30,285
Easy, since I'm
Dr. Frankenstein.

552
00:35:30,387 --> 00:35:31,590
(LAUGHS NERVOUSLY)

553
00:35:33,425 --> 00:35:34,790
I'm turning 48 in a few months

554
00:35:34,892 --> 00:35:37,997
and I think I need to
meet someone more grown.

555
00:35:38,099 --> 00:35:39,365
Someone I can talk to,

556
00:35:39,468 --> 00:35:42,466
just a proper woman
who knows good music...

557
00:35:42,568 --> 00:35:46,207
has seen old movies,
things like that.

558
00:35:46,309 --> 00:35:49,110
My last couple girlfriends
were 21 and 24...

559
00:35:49,212 --> 00:35:52,246
and they were honestly
kind of immature.

560
00:35:52,348 --> 00:35:54,382
(CHUCKLES SOFTLY) I
can imagine it might be

561
00:35:54,484 --> 00:35:58,448
a little hard to relate to
girls born in the 2000s.

562
00:35:58,550 --> 00:36:00,690
I have a really special client,

563
00:36:00,792 --> 00:36:02,157
her name is Sophie...

564
00:36:02,260 --> 00:36:04,920
she's a highly accomplished
lawyer, she's 39.

565
00:36:05,926 --> 00:36:07,494
Um...

566
00:36:08,427 --> 00:36:12,066
I wasn't really thinking 30s.

567
00:36:12,168 --> 00:36:13,315
LUCY: So when
you said older...

568
00:36:13,398 --> 00:36:15,535
I meant more like 27, 28.

569
00:36:16,002 --> 00:36:17,237
LUCY: Ah.

570
00:36:17,339 --> 00:36:19,071
It gets really intense
and complicated

571
00:36:19,173 --> 00:36:20,140
with women in their 30s.

572
00:36:20,242 --> 00:36:22,144
They have really
high expectations

573
00:36:22,246 --> 00:36:24,110
and they tend to rush
things because I guess,

574
00:36:24,213 --> 00:36:26,480
their biological
clock's ticking.

575
00:36:27,847 --> 00:36:30,848
I have another really
beautiful client, she's 31...

576
00:36:30,950 --> 00:36:31,950
Uh.

577
00:36:33,216 --> 00:36:34,689
No.

578
00:36:34,791 --> 00:36:37,524
Someone... 27.

579
00:36:38,456 --> 00:36:40,327
Even 29 is pushing it.

580
00:36:40,430 --> 00:36:42,050
Trust me... it's the
best thing for everyone.

581
00:36:42,133 --> 00:36:43,667
I genuinely get
along much better

582
00:36:43,769 --> 00:36:44,861
with girls in their 20s.

583
00:36:46,667 --> 00:36:49,434
I don't care what she's
like or how she lives...

584
00:36:49,536 --> 00:36:52,074
I just care that she's
my type physically.

585
00:36:52,176 --> 00:36:54,135
LUCY: What's your
type physically?

586
00:36:54,237 --> 00:36:55,410
Fit.

587
00:36:56,044 --> 00:36:57,247
LUCY: Just fit?

588
00:36:57,948 --> 00:37:00,316
Fit. Nothing over 20 BMI.

589
00:37:00,915 --> 00:37:02,285
Okay.

590
00:37:05,455 --> 00:37:08,584
Thank you for agreeing to
come on a date with me.

591
00:37:08,686 --> 00:37:10,011
LUCY: Well, I only
said yes to this

592
00:37:10,094 --> 00:37:11,344
so you'd realize you're wrong...

593
00:37:11,427 --> 00:37:12,773
and you're not actually
interested in me.

594
00:37:12,856 --> 00:37:15,063
HARRY: My instincts
are usually right.

595
00:37:15,165 --> 00:37:16,347
You think that you're more right

596
00:37:16,430 --> 00:37:17,860
about this than a professional?

597
00:37:17,962 --> 00:37:21,034
Oh, sure, you're the
expert, but I trust my gut.

598
00:37:21,136 --> 00:37:24,203
LUCY: Okay. We'll see.

599
00:37:24,305 --> 00:37:26,243
You look really good today.

600
00:37:30,945 --> 00:37:32,180
Thanks.

601
00:37:32,282 --> 00:37:34,284
LUCY: <i>How many
drinks per week?</i>

602
00:37:34,386 --> 00:37:39,350
Depends, but like, 8? 10?
Work makes it hard not to.

603
00:37:39,452 --> 00:37:41,720
-Do you do drugs?
-Never.

604
00:37:43,223 --> 00:37:45,022
I do pot at parties.

605
00:37:45,124 --> 00:37:46,255
Me too.

606
00:37:46,357 --> 00:37:48,298
So not never.

607
00:37:49,160 --> 00:37:50,893
Hmm.

608
00:37:50,995 --> 00:37:53,501
What do you think is your
best physical feature?

609
00:37:55,103 --> 00:37:56,471
My eyes aren't bad.

610
00:38:04,578 --> 00:38:07,512
How did you end up
doing what you do?

611
00:38:07,614 --> 00:38:09,544
Both my parents
work in finance...

612
00:38:09,646 --> 00:38:10,746
and so does my brother,

613
00:38:10,848 --> 00:38:12,453
so I just kind of
ended up doing it.

614
00:38:12,555 --> 00:38:14,395
And we all work for the
firm my mother started.

615
00:38:15,953 --> 00:38:18,890
-It's a family business.
-Yeah, it's boring.

616
00:38:18,992 --> 00:38:20,162
Mm.

617
00:38:20,264 --> 00:38:21,991
How did you get into
doing what you do?

618
00:38:24,468 --> 00:38:28,365
It was the... first and
(CHUCKLES) only thing

619
00:38:28,467 --> 00:38:29,768
I was really good at.

620
00:38:31,509 --> 00:38:33,160
HARRY: <i>What else do you
want to know about me?</i>

621
00:38:33,243 --> 00:38:34,537
I bet your parents never raised

622
00:38:34,639 --> 00:38:36,412
their voices at each other.

623
00:38:37,311 --> 00:38:38,510
I think almost never.

624
00:38:38,612 --> 00:38:40,515
Maybe they were
secretly fighting.

625
00:38:42,186 --> 00:38:43,947
Did they ever fight about money?

626
00:38:44,853 --> 00:38:45,853
No.

627
00:38:46,890 --> 00:38:47,890
Makes sense.

628
00:38:49,086 --> 00:38:51,757
I think we emulate the
way our parents fight.

629
00:38:52,157 --> 00:38:53,627
Hmm.

630
00:38:53,729 --> 00:38:55,083
I see couples fighting in
the middle of the street

631
00:38:55,166 --> 00:38:56,696
in New York and I don't get it.

632
00:38:56,798 --> 00:38:59,435
Aren't they embarrassed to
do that in front of people?

633
00:39:01,473 --> 00:39:03,934
I'm the type to fight in
the middle of the street.

634
00:39:04,876 --> 00:39:07,206
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

635
00:39:07,308 --> 00:39:08,609
Have you ever done that?

636
00:39:10,675 --> 00:39:12,841
-Never.

he will like me?</i>

638
00:39:14,515 --> 00:39:15,944
I think you will
really like him.

639
00:39:16,047 --> 00:39:18,713
<i>-Are you sure?</i>
-Stay open-minded. (LAUGHS)

640
00:39:18,816 --> 00:39:20,988
<i>-I'm so nervous.</i>
-All right.

641
00:39:21,090 --> 00:39:22,224
Okay, text me after

642
00:39:22,326 --> 00:39:23,607
-and I'll call you tomorrow.
<i>-Okay.</i>

643
00:39:23,690 --> 00:39:25,222
-Okay, talk soon, Sophie. Bye.
<i>-Bye.</i>

644
00:39:25,324 --> 00:39:26,557
-Hi.
-Hi.

645
00:39:26,659 --> 00:39:28,629
-Wow. Thank you.
-(CHUCKLES SOFTLY)

646
00:39:29,263 --> 00:39:30,466
You're welcome.

647
00:39:32,066 --> 00:39:33,402
You okay?

648
00:39:33,504 --> 00:39:35,904
Yes. My client is going
on a date right now too.

649
00:39:36,006 --> 00:39:37,106
You seem nervous.

650
00:39:37,208 --> 00:39:38,570
I really want her
to like this guy.

651
00:39:38,672 --> 00:39:40,372
She's had, like, 10
bad dates in a row

652
00:39:40,474 --> 00:39:42,044
and I just need to deliver.

653
00:39:42,146 --> 00:39:43,377
Are you feeling guilty that

654
00:39:43,479 --> 00:39:45,382
you're about to
go on a good date?

know if I like you

00:39:51,819 --> 00:39:54,350
or if I just like the
places you take me to.

659
00:39:54,452 --> 00:39:55,551
You like me?

660
00:39:55,653 --> 00:39:57,756
When did that happen?

661
00:39:57,858 --> 00:40:00,225
I think when I saw the
way you pick up the bill.

662
00:40:00,327 --> 00:40:01,527

HARRY: I do it
really well, don't I?

664
00:40:03,328 --> 00:40:04,868
You do.

665
00:40:04,970 --> 00:40:07,129
Just one swift motion.

666
00:40:08,435 --> 00:40:11,133
No hesitation. No fear.

667
00:40:11,235 --> 00:40:14,070
HARRY: Well, I can afford
it, so why would I be scared?

668
00:40:15,345 --> 00:40:17,246
You're investing
a lot in me, huh?

669
00:40:17,348 --> 00:40:20,680
I just want our
dates to be romantic.

670
00:40:20,782 --> 00:40:24,520
How expensive a meal is
makes the date romantic?

671
00:40:25,153 --> 00:40:26,181
Doesn't it?

672
00:40:30,588 --> 00:40:33,463
When we first met...

673
00:40:33,565 --> 00:40:36,330
you said your job makes
you think like a mortician

674
00:40:36,432 --> 00:40:38,699
or an insurance claims adjuster.

675
00:40:39,433 --> 00:40:41,097
How am I as a corpse?

676
00:40:42,302 --> 00:40:43,836
A good corpse.

677
00:40:44,735 --> 00:40:46,271
How about as a payout?

678
00:40:46,373 --> 00:40:48,043
(CHUCKLES SOFTLY)

679
00:40:48,145 --> 00:40:49,242
Couldn't ask for better.

680
00:40:49,344 --> 00:40:50,942
As a nursing home partner?

681
00:40:53,148 --> 00:40:54,550
A grave buddy?

682
00:41:01,257 --> 00:41:03,086
You can do better than me.

683
00:41:03,927 --> 00:41:05,525
Can I?

684
00:41:05,627 --> 00:41:07,926
You know how to do
the math, don't you?

685

In my line of work...

686
00:41:13,030 --> 00:41:15,399
I meet hundreds of
highly desirable,

high quality men...

688
00:41:17,004 --> 00:41:21,637
but you are what we call
in my industry "a unicorn."

689
00:41:21,739 --> 00:41:24,345
An impossible fantasy.

690
00:41:24,447 --> 00:41:25,945
Your brother was a unicorn, too.

691
00:41:26,047 --> 00:41:29,184
The reason my clients cannot
lower their expectations...

692
00:41:29,286 --> 00:41:31,451
is because, against all odds,

693
00:41:31,553 --> 00:41:33,850
men like you do actually exist.

694
00:41:33,952 --> 00:41:36,020
Well, I'm sure something
is wrong with me.

695
00:41:38,326 --> 00:41:39,892
You're perfect.

You're smart.

You have ideal income,
ideal education...

ideal lifestyle, ideal height...

699
00:41:49,837 --> 00:41:52,204
you're good-looking,
you have a great body,

700
00:41:52,306 --> 00:41:53,741
you're charming.

701
00:41:55,544 --> 00:41:58,607
You were born rich, raised rich,

702
00:41:58,709 --> 00:42:00,282
you're still rich.

703
00:42:00,384 --> 00:42:03,012
You own a penthouse in Tribeca.

704
00:42:03,115 --> 00:42:05,048
You can take a girl to
a restaurant like this

705
00:42:05,150 --> 00:42:09,889
and it's not even (LAUGHS)
like a special occasion.

706
00:42:09,991 --> 00:42:14,627
You don't have a drug habit
or a call girls habit.

707
00:42:14,729 --> 00:42:16,900
You even know how
to cut your hair,

708
00:42:17,002 --> 00:42:18,660
and how to dress.

709
00:42:18,762 --> 00:42:20,130
You have taste.

710
00:42:21,737 --> 00:42:26,536
You are a 10 out of
10 in every category.

711
00:42:26,638 --> 00:42:28,875
A complete package.

712
00:42:28,977 --> 00:42:32,674
So I don't know why you're
trying to throw it all away

713
00:42:32,776 --> 00:42:33,742
on someone like me.

714
00:42:33,844 --> 00:42:35,684
What's someone like you?

715
00:42:36,583 --> 00:42:38,918
Just a girl who works.

00:42:41,086 --> 00:42:43,822
I'm older than the women
you could be dating.

717
00:42:43,924 --> 00:42:47,595
Which means my looks
won't last as long.

718
00:42:47,698 --> 00:42:49,891
And I have fewer years
left to get pregnant.

719
00:42:49,993 --> 00:42:52,368
If you marry a 25-year-old,

720
00:42:52,470 --> 00:42:55,605
then in 10 years
she'll look like me.

721
00:42:55,707 --> 00:42:58,736
If you marry me, in 10 years
I'll look like my mother.

722
00:42:58,838 --> 00:43:00,671
What does your mother look like?

723
00:43:00,773 --> 00:43:03,643
I was born poor, raised poor,

724
00:43:03,745 --> 00:43:06,680
and even though I
work, I have debt.

725
00:43:06,783 --> 00:43:10,180
I'm a college dropout
and a failed actress.

726
00:43:11,649 --> 00:43:13,950
I have no dowry.

727
00:43:14,052 --> 00:43:16,489
If anything, I have
a negative dowry.

728
00:43:16,591 --> 00:43:18,727
Do I look like I need a dowry?

729
00:43:19,928 --> 00:43:23,425
At the end of the day,
the math doesn't add up.

730
00:43:23,527 --> 00:43:27,362
Given your position in the
marketplace and given mine,

731
00:43:28,305 --> 00:43:30,134
I'm not a girl you marry.

732
00:43:31,707 --> 00:43:34,407
I'm a girl that you
go home with once,

733
00:43:34,509 --> 00:43:36,371
and then never call again.

734
00:43:39,951 --> 00:43:40,951
So...

735
00:43:41,814 --> 00:43:44,049
what are you doing with me?

736
00:43:48,018 --> 00:43:49,525
You say you think I'm smart,

737
00:43:49,627 --> 00:43:51,760
but you're talking to
me like I'm a caveman.

738
00:43:54,797 --> 00:43:56,316
I wouldn't date you
if I didn't see value.

739
00:43:56,399 --> 00:43:57,564
I'm not like my brother.

740
00:43:57,666 --> 00:43:58,882
I'm not looking for the nicest,

741
00:43:58,965 --> 00:44:01,330
prettiest rich girl
who likes me back.

742
00:44:05,171 --> 00:44:07,142
I'm looking for someone
who understands the game,

743
00:44:07,244 --> 00:44:08,711
how the world works.

744
00:44:10,207 --> 00:44:12,341
I'm looking for
someone I respect.

745
00:44:13,315 --> 00:44:14,409
And trust.

746
00:44:16,113 --> 00:44:18,149
Someone who knows more than me.

747
00:44:20,792 --> 00:44:22,741
I don't want to date you
for your material assets...

748
00:44:22,824 --> 00:44:24,179
though I think you're
underselling them

749
00:44:24,262 --> 00:44:26,025
by a significant margin.

750
00:44:27,562 --> 00:44:29,127
Material assets are cheap,

751
00:44:30,398 --> 00:44:31,800
they don't last.

752
00:44:33,332 --> 00:44:36,970
I want to be with you for
your intangible assets.

753
00:44:37,936 --> 00:44:39,234
Those are good investments.

754
00:44:39,336 --> 00:44:41,337
They don't degrade.
They only get sharper.

755
00:44:44,012 --> 00:44:45,873
And, besides, I have
enough material assets

756
00:44:45,975 --> 00:44:47,409
for the both of us.

757
00:44:51,422 --> 00:44:52,720
I see a lot of potential here.

758
00:44:52,823 --> 00:44:54,241
I think you and I could
make great partners.

759
00:44:54,324 --> 00:44:55,890
I hope you agree.

760
00:45:02,599 --> 00:45:03,682
As for what I can do for you...

761
00:45:03,765 --> 00:45:04,728
I think I'm the
only guy this rich

762
00:45:04,830 --> 00:45:06,395
you can actually stand.

763
00:45:09,574 --> 00:45:11,702
I don't like you
because you're rich.

764
00:45:11,804 --> 00:45:13,369
Then why do you like me?

765
00:45:17,813 --> 00:45:20,310
Because you make
me feel valuable.

766
00:45:27,786 --> 00:45:29,451

Hey, Lucy. Can I speak
to you in my office?

891
00:54:52,815 --> 00:54:55,824
Have you spoken with Sophie L.?

892
00:54:55,926 --> 00:54:58,193
Uh, not yet. Just Mark P.

893
00:54:58,296 --> 00:55:02,257
VIOLET: I just hung up
with Sophie's lawyer.

894
00:55:02,359 --> 00:55:03,563
Her lawyer?

895
00:55:04,895 --> 00:55:09,371
Apparently, she was
assaulted on the date.

897
00:55:19,310 --> 00:55:20,781
By Mark P.?

898
00:55:20,883 --> 00:55:21,911
VIOLET: Yes.

899
00:55:23,985 --> 00:55:25,046
Last night?

900
00:55:25,855 --> 00:55:27,651
Are you serious?

901
00:55:27,754 --> 00:55:30,392
She's bringing charges
to the company, not you.

902
00:55:30,494 --> 00:55:32,409
I have a call with the
legal team in two minutes...

903
00:55:32,492 --> 00:55:33,772
and we're going
to figure it out.

904
00:55:34,492 --> 00:55:35,828
I need to speak with her.

905
00:55:35,930 --> 00:55:37,366
Lucy, no.

-Violet, she's my client.
-VIOLET: She's not anymore.

907
00:55:40,337 --> 00:55:42,468
So if Sophie calls,
you must not pick up.

908
00:55:42,570 --> 00:55:45,733
-I can't do nothing.
-VIOLET: Do nothing.

909
00:55:45,835 --> 00:55:47,405
You made the best
match you could

910
00:55:47,507 --> 00:55:49,408
given the information you have.

911
00:55:49,510 --> 00:55:51,173
This particular match
did not work out

912
00:55:51,275 --> 00:55:55,414
but you've been doing amazing
work for Sophie for months.

913
00:55:55,516 --> 00:55:58,248
The match didn't
"not work out," Vi,

914
00:55:58,350 --> 00:56:00,420
she was assaulted.

this happened before?

This is dating.

it happens to all of us.

any one of them

1086

"No Blacks, no fatties"?

1087
01:05:48,405 --> 01:05:50,237

actual therapist,

1088
